B006AZZPCM|5.0|I've been searching for a youtube interface for my Kindle Fire and this is it.  Within a few seconds of the TubeMate download, I was saving my favorite YouTube videos. There is a web-search feature at the bottom of the screen as well as other unobtrusive icons: to share my videos with others as well as search my own device for my saved videos. There are ads at the bottom of the screen, but they are not distractive.  The downloads/saved files are very sharp and are saved in formats which can be transfered to other devices. This app was thoughtfully designed. I highly recommend it. Thanks.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|great game to have for the kindle fire I play this game more then reading book. great game to have
B005STGJHQ|5.0|Very pleased with this one; I just wish they had put it on 180 gram heavy virgin vinyl.  But it sounds excellent and has excellent dynamics; as the previous guy said beggars can't be choosers.  Also the other vinyl releases are great; they took great pride in the production and have nice anti-static sleeves.  The best sounding LP out of the collection is the latest Wasted Light.  The packaging of that one is top notch and the discs are HeAvY. (It was all done on analog equipment & shows)  I asked Santa Claus a few days before Thanksgiving for the Foo Fighters vinyl re-issues.  I did not realize he had a direct line to David Grohl's house.  I believe and I am over the age of 30.
B005URRCUY|5.0|perfect condition and sounds great.... Will be a great gift! It was brand new and packaged perfectly. The numerous pictures of the vans are also funny. The songs are great as well with the first song of course everyone will know due to the radio!
0765357151|2.0|I gave this 2 stars because the novella, I am Legend, is interesting. Had it been published on its own, or if there was at least some warning that completely unrelated short stories were going to immediately follow it, unannounced, as just chapters, I would have given this 4 stars. I am Legend is drastically different from the movie. Just consider it a different story with the same name. The short stories that follow the novella are nowhere near as interesting or good in quality. I wish I had read some of the reviews here beforehand so I wouldn't have wasted my time reading them, bored, and highly confused as to how they related to the first half of the book.

Shine Runner is an attempt to put both types together in a seamless and fun manner.  Did they do it?  You betcha!<br /><br />Shine Runner has all the elements that one should look for in a game.  The graphics are excellent.  Not perfect, as I noted some textures appearing in front of other objects instead of behind, but very very good.  For those with slower devices, the detail level can be turned down, which is a nice touch and should allow more folks to play.  Two sets of controls are offered, touch screen or tilt, with the later having a sensitivity adjustment setting.  I found both to be very accurate and responsive on both my devices.  Bringing it all together as a whole work is the sound effects and soundtrack.  These are professional quality, fit the game, and aren't repeated so often as to become annoying.<br /><br />Gameplay is dead simple and fun.  In short, you race around the bayous from location to location to trade goods.  There is no speed control here, you run flat out while trying to dodge around gators, branches, shanties, the fuzz, and other yokels.  Colliding with these slows you down and can reduce the bonus cash that is given out at the end of the run for the time you had left remaining.  But at least you get an interesting and often humorous audio/visual feedback when you do this.  Various money bags can be collected up as you go, several of which require you to launch off ramps set up in the waterway.  At the end of each trip, you buy/sell your smuggled goodies, hopefully for a handsome profit.  You've got 10 days, the same as 10 runs, to make all the money you can.  When the game ends, all your profits are added up for a final score.  That score is recorded locally, and globally if you enable the OpenFeint option.<br /><br />I found Shine Runner to be rather fun to play, but be prepared to spend 10-20 minutes playing in order to get through all 10 runs.<br /><br />*Note: Apps can get updates and change over time, for better or worse.

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|A disgraced financial journalist, and a young antisocial computer hacker join forces to solve the 40 year old mystery of a teenage girl's disappearance.  As they do so, they get drawn into serious crime and corruption, deadly family secrets, and a string of unsolved murders of young women spanning fifty years, which puts their own lives at unbelievable risk.  Will they solve the mystery before they become history?<br /><br />When I saw the original movie series about two years ago,  I was awestruck by mostly the awesome acting of Noomi rapace, and the movie's visual style, and it's inherent raunchiness, which is more common in stylish European thrillers than slick Hollywood movies.  When I heard there would be an English version,  I thought this would be a hard act to follow, and without Noomi Rapace as the female lead would not be the same, because she was so much an integral element of the original movies success.<br /><br />In the meantime I listened to the audiobook version featuring Simon Vance, available on Amazon owned audible.com, which I also found quite enjoyable.  He does all the voices including Lisbeth with a slight Swedish accent that veers toward cockney. The story is much more detailed with many elements glossed over or left out of the original movie.<br /><br />So, when I heard it was about to be released, and saw the trailer, and understood the pedigree behind this movie with David Fincher directing, and Daniel Craig as Blomquist,  I made a point of going to the evening show before its official opening today.<br /><br />Inevitably, one cannot help but compare with the previous experience.  Definitely, the fact that this is in English is the greatest justification for the remake, so for many people who are distracted by subtitles this will automatically be a better experience.<br /><br />Steven Zaillian, the screenwriter, previously won an Oscar for writing Schindlers List.  From a storytelling point of view, it stays close to the original story, with much more detail, in that respect exceeding the original.  In other respects too it exceeds the original. I particularly liked for example the soundtrack with its darker gothic metal tones by Trent Reznor, and the opening somewhat James Bond style imagery although darker, and I loved the storytelling.<br /><br />This movie completes the full arc of the story, whereas I felt unclear in the original about the full circle story against Wennerstrom.  This movie introduces the cat, and Cecilia Vanger as a character.  We get to meet some of the characters we don't meet in the original.<br /><br />David Fincher goes to great lengths not to have it be a remake, having each scene be somewhat different.  This movie is also raunchier, you'll know what I mean when you see it and focuses more on the relationship between Blomquist and Salander.  It also has occasional humor. The scene where Michael is hunted shocked me in my seat, and there are several shocking scenes in the movie, including the crime against Lisabeth by her guardian.  This is a harrowing scene as is the basement scene, although I felt that particular one was more harrowing in the original.<br /><br />Perhaps the single best thing about this version is that it captures the intention of the original author.  Apparently, when Stieg Larson was a teenager he witnessed a gang rape of a teenage girl, and did not intervene to stop it.  He was always troubled by this,  second guessing his behavior, and worked as an independent investigative journalist, and this was partly his motivation for writing the Millenium Trilogy series which has now reportedly sold over 60 million copies, and the great visual art of 4 movies.  In fact, he gave the character Lisbeth the same first name as the original victim, so when Blomquist proposes to Lisbeth that she help him find a killer of women, one senses that Larson would be very pleased about this.<br /><br />With Lisbeth Salander he has crafted one of the most memorable female characters I have experienced onscreen, and a type of character we don't see enough in Hollywood movies, the strong female protagonist.  This type of character you will see in European movies.  Recent examples worth checking out would be [[ASIN:B006INDMEE The Debt]]with Jessica Chastain and Helen Mirren,  and the miraculous survival abilities of Carice Van Houten in Verhoeven's [[ASIN:B000TGCR38 Black Book]], which I own.<br /><br />There is a revenge and justice theme that permeates the series, which gets more explored later in the trilogy. Lisbeth comes more into her own in the second movie, and even though the Academy does not usually look to the thriller genre for nominations, there may be an Oscar nomination for Rooney Mara in the The Girl who played with Fire.<br /><br />I liked also seeing Robin Wright as Blomquists partner, and while I still give the original movie the cool points for style and the visuals, I think many people will without my preconceptions warm to Rooney Mara who does give a great performance, in her unique way as this antisocial yet extremely resourceful  and intelligent computer hacker.<br /><br />I recommend it whether or not you have seen the original series.  I also recommend you do check out the original series.  If you are an Amazon Prime member, as I write you can watch the original series for free on Amazon video.[[ASIN:B003TTWJJO The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (English subtitled)]], [[ASIN:B003Z9SYFQ The Girl Who Played With Fire (English subtitled)]], and [[ASIN:B0046H0HZG The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest]].<br /><br />If they do complete the rest of the trilogy, there will be opportunities in those movies to vastly outshine the originals, certainly if they include more detail from the books as they do here.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|It had to happen sooner or later, and finally it did. Woody Allen and Paris \\"fell\\" in love with each other, and, as the result, we, the viewers, received a precious gift from the master of subtle, intelligent and charming dra-medies, gentle and charming \\"movable feast,\\" the new movie \\"Midnight in Paris \\".<br /><br />I have been a fan of Woody Allen for long times and seen all his movies, those that he made, and those in which he starred or only wrote the screenplay for. I look forward to each of his films and I am ready to love them before I even see them. I knew I would like Midnight in Paris, but I had no idea how good it was. From the first frame, following the Darius Khondji's camera on such familiar but uniquely beautiful streets, alleys, boulevards and quays of the City of Light, it was hard not to fell in love with Paris and with the film of Allen, his love letter to the most famous city in the world, capital of love and Mecca for writers, artists, musicians as to whom Paris gave inspiration during all times and epochs - Belle &Eacute;poque 1890s, the Golden days of the 1920s, and today, right now...<br /><br />Midnight in Paris is a delightful, kind (yes, this is Woody Allen), light, and charming film, which can be described as A Paris Midnight Magical Movable Feast. Paris in the film is beautiful during day light, night time, bright sun, and rainy hours. Oscar nominee, the master cinematographer of many remarkable films, including Panic Room, Se7en and Evita, Darius Khondji worked with Allen on three films: Anything Else (2003), Midnight in Paris (2011), and the next film, the Roman project Bop Decameron (2012).<br /><br />Soundtrack consists of Allen's favorite songs from the 1920s-30s by such songwriters as Cole Porter, Glen Miller, and Enoch Light, and from the repertoire of Josephine Baker and Juliet Greco. For the original film theme, Allen picked the guitar composition of the French jazz guitarist Stephane Wrembel \\"Bistro Fada\\". Wrembel's influence and source of inspiration has been the music of the famous French Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt, whose longtime fan and admirer is Woody Allen himself. According Wrembel, Allen was searching for a typical French-Parisian melody, reflecting the spirit and atmosphere of Paris. I can confirm that the film theme and the songs that Allen picked up for Midnight in Paris are important, integral component of the film's charm and add to the romantic and joyous feeling that the film brings to the viewers.<br /><br />As always, in Woody Allen's movies, the actors give uniformly good performances. Owen Wilson is very convincing and likable as Gil, Hollywood's successful screenplay writer who works on a first novel, a protagonist, a much younger, attractive, and funny Woody Allen stand-in. Adrien Brody played the best role since The Pianist (very small cameo, but memorable and hilarious). Kathy Bates was very believable as a famous literary critic and friend to the struggling talented writers and artists. Alison Pill was impressive as the bright, outgoing but showing the signs of instability wife of the celebrated American writer. I hardly recognized Corey Stoll but liked him a lot as another famous American writer. Watching Marion Cotillard, I had no problems believing that the character she played, Adriana, could have been the muse and the girlfriend of not just one but three amazingly and uniquely talented world renowned painters. Rachel McAdams (Inez, Gil's not so romantic fianc&eacute;e), Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy (Inez's parents on the business trip in Paris who don't seem to approve their daughter's choice), and Michael Sheen (Paul, Inez's pedantic and arrogant former boyfriend from college) were quite good as not very likable Americans. The First Lady of France, Carla Bruni appeared in a small role of a museum guide.<br /><br />The story itself was so lovely in using the time travel as the plot device and brought so many funny and sharp one-liners, dialogs and scenesas well as the plenty moments of recognizing the beloved literature and art figures of the past, that I sat and smiled happily during the whole film. Like I mentioned in the beginning, I expected to love the film even before I saw it and knew from the very first scene that I was in for something very special but my husband, who is much more reserved in his ratings and not often calls a film a masterpiece, used the word for Midnight in Paris and asked whether the film has won some prestigious prizes. Well, the awards season is several months away, but for me, and I am sure for all Woody Allen's fans, Midnight in Paris is a great prize from the writer/director.literature and art figures of the past, that I sat and smiled happily during the whole film.

B004XD03RK|5.0|In 1991, Death released their 4th full-length album, Human. With this lineup featuring Sean Reinert and Paul Masvidal of Cynic and Steve DiGiorgio, it can already be told that this would be masterful, and even after 20 years since its initial release, it has aged very well with its developed songwriting, organic vibe and phenomenal musicianship. With this re-release by Relapse, we are given not just given another pressing of this album, but a full 2 disc package to benefit the band's fan base. I may not be one of those that owns the numbered edition pack with the extra third disc of rehearsal tracks, but instead, I am satisfied just the same.<br /><br />Disc 1 gives us the album. The album sounds fantastic with its remaster and remixing, as it sounds fuller and brings out the best of each note and fill. We have all the classics, such as the trademark track \\"Lack of Comprehension\\" with its jazz fusion introduction, the riff-filled wonders of \\"Suicide Machine\\" and \\"Together as One\\", and the instrumental guitar driven \\"Cosmic Sea\\", featuring tradeoffs with Chuck Schuldiner and Paul Masvidal. That's just a small taste, but it's rare to hear such accomplished songs in the whole metal realm, let alone death metal. As a bonus, we're given their cover of KISS's \\"God of Thunder\\", which is well-done to the point that it's far from a tacked-on throwaway.<br /><br />Disc 2 features the bonus tracks that help to make this a worthwhile grab. It features the instrumental studio tracks that were used on this album, sans vocals. It's a great treat for those that admire the instrumental aspect of this band. As well as that, we have some demo tracks of most of the songs on this album, featuring an instrumental version of \\"Vacant Planets\\". It may be more die hard fan oriented, but whether you're new to this band or have been a devoted fan since their inception in the 80's, it's all worth the money.<br /><br />It's not just the music that makes this re-release worthwhile, but the booklet definitely deserves a mention. With liner notes written by Paul Masvidal and remixing engineer Jim Morris, lyrics that show how much of an icon Chuck was to songwriting, and photographs scattered throughout the time that document the recording process of Human, there is a lot to witness here. It sure beats just downloading the album in my opinion.<br /><br />This re-release not only strengthens the legacy that Human has given off all these years back, but it fully documents a work of art and an honest effort given off by a trademark band. I couldn't be happier for Relapse for releasing this, and I know that this would make Schuldiner proud.t definitely deserves a mention.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is an excellent aftermarket CPU cooler.  On the stock cooler, my CPU (Core i5-2600K at stock clock/voltage) idled around 45C, hitting almost 80C at load.  With this cooler, it idles at ~25C, hitting maybe 50C on load.  Overclocked, it is hardly hitting any higher temperatures that with stock clocks.  The only downside is the instruction manual is a little bit difficult to understand, and it is a HUGE cooler.  If it fits on your board and in your case without covering anything else (most likely need to be an ATX MB and probably at least a midsize tower), I would highly recommend this cooler.

B0034G4P4O|4.0|So what do you get when you take the director of The Lord of the Rings movies, the director of the Indiana Jones movies, and the writer/producer for the current series of Doctor Who and give them $135 million to play around with? Turns out you get the best action film I've seen in ages and what will likely be the Best Animated Film winner at the next Oscar ceremony.  The Adventures of Tintin is based on a Belgian comic book that, despite having three years of French in high school, I have no memory of. I'm sure I read it at some point, but I was always more of an Asterix kind of guy. So while I cannot comment on the film compared with the comics, I can comment on the film itself and I can say that it was everything I'd hoped for.  The story focuses on Tintin (Jamie Bell), a...boy, I suppose? It's hard to tell his age for sure, but I get the impression he's supposed to be around sixteen or seventeen? However he lives on his own and has a job as a successful reporter, so perhaps he's just an adult. Anyhow, he buys a model ship, only to find out that certain other people, including a rather sinister-looking man (Daniel Craig), want to get their hands on it. Soon the boat is stolen, and Tintin, along with his faithful dog, Snowy, are kidnapped, and trapped aboard a ship.  With the help of the ship's captain (Andy Sirkis), he manages to escape, and winds up in chases involving, at various points, the following vehicles: a cargo ship, a life boat, a seaplane, a motorcycle (that becomes a unicycle), and a hotel (don't ask). This culminates in a sword-fight that uses cranes as swords. It is, to put it mildly, somewhat action-packed. I really can't say enough about the action sequences in this movie, which very much put me in mind of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, only with a better budget.  But like the best Speilberg action movies, it doesn't lose track of the story, which is engaging and enjoyable. All the characters serve a purpose and are fun to watch on screen. Captain Haddock, in particular, was wonderful fun. Andy Serkis continues to prove that he really did get the royal screw-job when he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance as Golum. Jamie Bell is also great as Tintin, who is played somewhat like a younger version of the Doctor, which is no surprise given Moffat's involvement.  The film did seem to drag a bit toward the end, and the obvious set-up for a sequel was a bit annoying. On the plus side, regardless of how the film performs here in the USA, a sequel is likely, since it's already pulled in nearly $240 million overseas.  One final word: if you want to see the film in the theatre, don't knock yourself out to see it in 3D. The 3D effect is ok, and doesn't distract or anything, but I don't know that it really adds anything to the movie. It was well done and all, but like with any 3D, it does dim the screen considerably, and I'm sure the film would work just as well in 2D.

At first, I thought \\"oh, with all of these dream layers, maybe this is something Nolan is doing to mess up our minds.\\"  When the film finished, I googled, and there are scores of postings about sound sync problems with the INCEPTION Blu-Ray.  There's likely a reason a two disc set is $7.99, and it's terrible that such a major tech kind of film is produced so poorly.    Boo. Hiss.

I have studied the Holocaust at length, and yet this is a story framed around real life events I had never heard of.  The story of Sarah and her brother are fictional, yet they are as real as any child you know.  By the end of chapter one, you are invested in their story and anxious to hear the two's fate.  This is a story that will never leave you. This book is the \\"Sophie's choice\\" of the literary world.  It speaks to the deepest connections, relationships and truths of the human condition.

What makes matters even worse than the use, or misuse (a much better word) of this overused, tried and true plot is that it was not only bad, it was insulting. How accomplished and usually very funny actors such as Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds could co-star in such a monstrosity is beyond me. While there were a few scattered comedic moments here and there worthy of a laugh or two, I found the film overall to be nothing more than bathroom humor run amok, the likes of which one would expect in films such as 'Hangover I & II. It was too long as well.

B005DF2QMC|5.0|I am not techno savy but this product was usable even for me.  I have loads of audio tapes now accessible on my computer, on cd or in mp3 format.  Not only that, but when I had a question regarding the product (due to my own ignorance, nothing to do with the product itself) the customer service department responded promptly and graciously.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just got a new android tablet and this was one of the first games I downloaded and it is awesome. Realistic card action. Definitely a keeper!
B0063GORYU|5.0|nice little app. will provide hours of fun and challenges.  good graphics,  easy to learn but always new and entertaining.  a definite keeper
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm an aspiring music producer and through research I went ahead and bought these. The headphones themselves are some of the best and recommended by industry professionals. The company I bought them from shipped early and I got them very quick
B004YEJGEO|4.0|The puzzles are interesting and generate just the right among of brain-burn. It does get frustrating when a bug forces you to remove and replace pieces just to get them to behave correctly. I also find myself hitting my Home button while using the rotate object button.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I JUST CAME FROM SEEING MISSION IMPOSSIBLE GHOST PROTOCOL AND AS USUAL I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. I DID WISH THAT VING RHAMES WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE WHOLE MOVIE BUT MAYBE THE NEXT ONE. THIS MOVIE WAS ACTION PACKED AND AS USUAL TOM CRUISE DELIVERED RIGHT ON TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.  I WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS MOVIE THAT I ACTUALLY WENT TO THE THEATRE A DAY EARLY BUT LUCKILY I BROUGHT MY TICKET ONLINE AND I WAS ABLE TO USE IT TODAY.  I CANNOT WAIT TO GET THE DVD TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION.  I WATCHED ALL OF THE PREVIOUS MISSIONS BEFORE THIS RELEASE SO I COULD BE ON TOP OF MY GAME.  TAKE YOURSELF A HUGE BREAK AND RUN, DON'T WALK TO THIS MOVIE!!!! GO TOM CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.  JUST ME SD
B006C45MRE|5.0|Better than ever expected. Original. A must see. Story was good enough and had good dimension for all the characters even though it follows the same old redemption theme with everyone ending up happily ever after.
B004EPYZSU|1.0|the package does not state that you get an \\"ultra violet\\" copy. it states you get a digital copy. ultra violet is a scam to say the least. it requires you to sign up and agree to allow universal or sony to sell/share your information to their partners. if you don't agree you don't get the copy you paid for. it is a pain to have to set up phony accounts etc just to keep from being spammed bcs you wanted what you paid for.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|The graphics on this game are lovely on the Kindle Fire with really  beautiful color, and exciting arcade type game play. The only controls are right and left or pause, the speed is controlled by the game as you go zooming through the waterways and water caves finding loot. It made me laugh and I am really glad I bought it.
0439023521|5.0|I'm in my late 20's and I remember my little sister having to read this book over the summer about 2 years ago for school.  She was about 16. She's not really the reading type but I remember her exclaiming  how good the book was and doing a project on.  I hadn't realized that it was a young adult book at that time. But after seeing the movie trailer I had to read it.  It's a great thing I did, because this book has now been added to my top favorite books.  It's a good read and a great story. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B005Y423ZC|1.0|This review is ONLY about the filming of the concert.  Adele sounds amazing, the band rocks, and light show (if I could ever really see it) looks fantastic.<br /><br />HOWEVER, THE AMATEUR DIRECTING OF THE DVD RUINS ANY HOPE OF ACTUALLY SEEING THE CONCERT. Adele is a wonderful performer, so why would the director (and anyone on her staff who approved this DVD) film more of the back of Adele's head, the audience, a member the band's hands, another audience member, Adele far way from the side, more band's hands, a couple of audience members, a quick face shot of Adele, more audience, more band, more back of her head, a close up of her face, and then end with what..... more audience and band!!!!?  What is wrong with the director to this DVD?<br /><br />I want to see ADELE sing, not audience members singing with her!  I actually couldn't sit through more than a half hour before all the jump cuts and sweeping shots (THAT, AGAIN, DON'T SHOW US ADELE) make my stomach upset.  It's ok to sit the camera down and just film a performer, but somehow no one trusts Adele with this task.<br /><br />If you want to have this as background music, buy it.  But if you want to see the concert that Adele performed... well so do it.  Too bad this horrible director is more interested in showing us EVERYTHING EXCEPT ADELE on this DVD.  I wish I could return this as I am so mad that this is unwatchable. :(
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app. is everything it promises. it's simple to use, stable, and the ads don't get in the way. thanks for a great app!
B004EPYZSK|2.0|The commercials for this movie looked really interesting, but the movie was surprisingly boring. As you're watching it, you can come up with 100 better aliens vs. cowboy movies. After seeing the commercial for \\"Men in Black III,\\" I think anyone wanting to watch this should just hold on until that comes out.
B004EI2NM2|4.0|I just watched this and what can I say? As a straight male who is a hopeless romantic and a huge lover of beautifully shot and acted (and written) cinema, this really bowled me over. Having just watched an excellent film called \\"Elena Undone\\" I was looking for something similar so went for this. And very glad I am too. Someone mentioned that it's almost like a female version of \\"Before Sunrise\\" which incidentally is one of my favourite films of all time along with the brilliant sequel, \\"Before Sunset\\". It's also a tone poem and the fact that the two protaganists happen to be women is really incidental. ANYONE who's a romantic at heart and likes to get lost/wrapped up in a love story (yes it doesn't hurt that the two lead actresses are both stunning and are naked for 90% of the movie) will fall in love with this I think. I wasn't expecting it to be as intelligent and well written and well acted as it was. The whole damn thing just looks GORGEOUS to boot so hats off to the cinematographer there. I've not heard of this director or his other films before so I will have to investigate further I think.  Only thing that annoyed me as someone pointed out was the jarring and I think unecessary use of not just that vapid \\"Perfect Strangers\\" song but the music in general. It just seemed to be way too intrusive and LOUD as well. And why is it that films nowadays with subtitles have to be in white so it makes it all but impossible to read?! Especially with the scenes in the bathroom! I just don't understand why films can't be subtitled with a black border behind them just like the old days. Oh and whoever compared this to \\"Last Tango In Paris\\" well I wouldn't personally. For one I can't stand that film, pretentious overrated and self indulgent dreck. This is far, far better.  So yeah all in all a sumptious visual feast for the eyes and soul too - highly recommended, lesbian or straight :)
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|If there was a movie I could compare this to it would be to \\"Dan in Real Life\\" which also starred Steve Carrell. Both movies are smarter than most comedies and say a lot about family dynamics. Both are also flawed in a lot of little ways that lessen your enjoyment. So much in \\"Crazy, Stupid, Love\\" is funny and entertaining, particularly the Carrell and Gosling scenes and the Gosling and Emma Stone scenes. Where it doesn't always work is with the babysitter and Carrell's son who is 13 to her 17. After a film that's heavy on realism, the babysitter does something not only illegal but also unlikely at the end of the film that felt like something you'd find in a regular \\"American Pie\\" movie instead of the decent one they'd created here. Other than that, really good.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is by far one of the funnest games. Very addictive, too. Its a game I couldn't put down. Really makes you think.
B00003CX9S|5.0|I remember watching this movie on HBO when i was a kid.  my brother and I were stunned.   i have grown to love this classic film.   I would rent this movie also from a video store even if   it was not on cable.  This is a powerfull dramatic film.  when it got released on dvd some day i did buy it.  Again i say,  very good film.
B001UV4XFG|2.0|I just received this DVD. The DVD is from Canada, The title on the cover is in English and French. I'm very disappointed
B000UJCALI|5.0|I'm not too sure what the \\"Shining\\" really is, but I hear that it took place at the Overlook Hotel. Well, I've stayed there and I don't think I'd go back. It's just that, they don't seem to have cable TV or even the internet. And that's not the end of the world, because they've got a pretty nice ballroom for parties. Oh, and they wouldn't take my credit card for payment. They'd never heard of Visa. I had to write a check (which I'd never heard of). Anyway, they're pretty nice people. As for the Shining, I guess it's reallllllly scary? I mean I've heard that it's just shockiiiiiiinnng. Yeah, right. Wasn't it the same guy from Batman, like the Joker? You know, Chinatown? Yeah, I bet it was a reaaaallllll terror. Maybe I'll Redbox it. Sure, it'll be good for a Tuesday night when the X-Factor isn't playing on TV. I'll even order a pizza. Maybe stuffed-crust. Yeah!! And a Pepsi, for real!!! Oh, it's on!! Go Knicks!!!
B005KJZDXK|4.0|I usually dislike Christmas music a lot. It attacks my ears right after Thanksgiving to convince me to spend more money on presents and help the economy. Because of that, I was a little uneasy when I bought this album, but this one does not disappoint. The album sounds like an usual She & Him album but with covers of Christmas songs. I like that they did not go overboard with bells and other Christmas music atrocious additions. I wish M. Ward was featured a bit more vocally, but other than that it is a solid album for other Grinch's like me, who happens to enjoy She & Him pop indie sound.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I was looking for some headsets to play battlefield with some friends, in my PS3. A lot of people told me about how good turtle beach was and how they were the guys to go to for headsets, and how good a lot of others were, but I was not going to spend $60 on some headset. So I ignore there warnings about how Plantronics  was not that good. And got these... Boy were they WRONG!!!!! These are amazing!!!!!!!! They sound great, look way better than turtle beach, and are super comfy!!! If you want Bose like sound, go ahead and spend $200. But if you want good sound, great looking, cheap headsets, these are the ones for you!!!<br /><br />I do not regret it!!!<br /><br />P.S. For these you need a [[ASIN:B000N35A0Y USB 2.0 External 5.1 Channel 3D Sound Card Adapter for PC Notebook Laptop]]  , that's only for PS3, X Box does not need it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Game is exactly what you'd expect-- and that's spot-on!<br /><br />I like the large format much better than my i-phone version.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is wonderful as usual. It lets me have fun without too much thought or concentration. A classic and easy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|solitaire is a classic card game. this app is a simple and quick way to get that experience on your mobile device.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Seiko makes a pretty good watch. No, it's not high end. It's not really even mid end. But for well under $100 (retails for over $180) you can grab this watch from Amazon and have a very solid watch. It's Automatic, which in Seiko speak I believe means \\"Kinetic\\" (I'm no watch expert, so forgive me if I'm wrong). Automatic watches require no batteries as they charge and run based on the watch moving while being worn. Simply wearing it charges it. When not being worn, it WILL stop working inside a couple days, requiring the owner to reset it, spin the crown, and wear it. Where Seiko watches are a bit different is that is seems that automatic watch winders do NOT keep the watch charged when not being worn. Not exactly sure WHAT is different in their charging system, but apparently SOMETHING is. For me, it's not a big deal. Did i mention it sells for WELL under $100?! It keeps great time. And oh yea .. the other cool thing about it being Automatic...<br /><br />It also means the second hand spins around the face (almost) fluidly! No \\"tick, tick\\" jerking motion of the second hand. That alone is pretty cool, and in the age of most watches being quartz... a fluid second hand is kind of a \\"modern\\" marvel (lol)
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|As a dietetics major with an interest in eating disorders, this book was very hard for me to put down. When I finally did set it down, my mom snatched it up and caught up to where I had read in a flash; she thoroughly enjoyed it as well. The mind of someone battling anorexia is fascinating, though heartbreaking and haunting at the same time. Portia writes in a way that makes you feel as though she's invited you inside her head to feel what she was feeling throughout the years of her struggle with her weight and body image. The ending ties everything up in a way that leaves the reader satisfied, like leaving the theater after a \\"feel good\\" movie. I'd recommend this book to anyone!
B002RKRUEA|1.0|Why are we not supposed to read this book ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
0385534639|5.0|Finished my book club's \\"The night circus\\".  It's Erin Morgenstern's debut novel, and I already cannot wait for her new books to come!<br /><br />If you love fairy tales - you will find all the magic, and love, and good and evil, and complexity in this book... minus the fairies.  The first paragraph captivates and the story holds you tight till the last word!  What a delightful tale!
B000PKX2KA|4.0|All this unit does is configure itself as a COMn: port and send out NMEA sentences. The support forum is impossible to register on (the stoopid character verification don't work!). So, consequently I have to say there is very little product support access. Good luck if you need help. Personally, for $30 as opposed to $100 for a complete Garmin unit... spend the extra $70 and get a LCD screen, map product and complete pkg... this USB unit is okay, but by the time you attach it to a $300 netbook, mapping s/w (not Mapsource!)... then you might as well get a Garmin unit and spare yourself the aggravation.  Edit: Using Auto Route and Streets and Trips, this does work okay. I think I was more disappointed with their online forum registration as they use graphics to authenticate.... their graphics are so, so hard to read and I was, and still unable, to register. I have since upgraded from a 2 star to a 4 star as this unit does what it states (mind I've not taken it swimming yet!). Minus 1 star for the very bad forum registration.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The primary usage of this headset in my case is for gaming; the key attributes I look for in a a headset are quality, functionality, and comfort.  Unfortunately I haven't owned them long enough to provide feedback on the overall life of the battery, however the life of the battery under constant use (mic and surround) is in the realm of 5-7 hours.  I was extremely skeptical about going wireless but have been so pleased with this product I will likely never go back to a wired solution.  (I'm currently playing BF3 and SWTOR)  The sound the headset provides is top-notch, I've never had a high quality set like this on my head before and was blown away by the quality of sound that was produced; it's one of those things that until you've experienced it, it doesn't make a lot of sense.  In-game reactions to your sense of sound and interpretation of where that sound is coming from is second-nature and it's hard to even notice you do it, but if you pay attention, you owe it to your headset for knowing what direction those footsteps are coming from...  Functionality wise, I love the fact that I can walk away from my computer while in-game or on skype and still be 100% in communication with my friends.  The mic mutes when you raise it up or you can use the mute control button on the set.  I haven't used any of the G keys as I've been too busy to program them or research good uses for them, but it doesn't seem as if I will really need them for much, they're just an added feature or fluff to me.  As for comfort, I'm embarrassed to say how long the intervals were that I would go with them on, and everyone is different, however I found them to be very comfortable and cause little to no irritation to my head or ears.  They fit so well in fact, that the usual \\"headset hair\\" is a bit more pronounced across the center of your skull.  Overall I would highly recommend this product to anyone willing to drop $120 on a new headset; I have no doubt you will NOT be disappointed.
B003ES5ZPK|1.0|Was excited when I first discovered this item so I quickly ordered one. When it arrived it was Dead On Arrival. Returning it ASAP and have already bought one locally for twice the price because I was impatient.
0312576463|5.0|Don't believe the haters. This novel is well crafted, full of delightfully witty writing, with all kinds of psychological depth. Just enough biting social commentary for  spice. It's filled with lots of anguish and yearning for these loveably flawed characters, but it ends on a hopeful note. Another great novel from a great writer.
B005HXGE9G|4.0|Saw the first New Blood tour in 2010, really enjoyed the show and looked forward to the original intent of the artists covering Peter's work, but loved the new orchestrations we heard in NYC. Still love the new arrangements, but some of the female vocals just don't compare with some of the original recordings. Really miss Kate Bush.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Like some other reviewers, I also grew up with the original Superman. I began watching the Smallville series with a little prejudice. However, once I began watching the series, my attitude changed and I was hooked. Smallville, I think, gives us a little insight on what it was like for Superman trying to grow up as a regular kid. I would highly recommend the series.
0393327345|5.0|If you have not read the book or seen the movie, then definitely buy this book.  If you plan to do both, I would probably recommend reading the book before the movie. If you are going to do only one, see the movie.   I purchased this book on recommendation from a co-worker.  I loved, loved, loved the Fight Club movie.  I was told this book was similar to the movie, but also different, that it provided a different perspective.  I did not find that to be the case. The two follow one another quite closely.  The movie does do some things different, but not enough so to make the two overly distinguishable.    I am still giving this a 5/5.  It is a genuinely unique read and enjoyable start to finish.  But I think it works better as a standalone from the movie.  I very seldom reccommend a movie over a book, but in this case I preferred the movie.  That takes nothing away from the book, but rather says how good the movie is.
B002CGSYNU|1.0|This lens cap does not fit the 14-42mm Zuiko lens as the product name states.  It's way too small.  I have no use for it.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I am an avid google calendar User and this app works perfectly for me.  syncs with google and even looks similar which I love!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I love the cover for the kindle.  However, the Kindle Fire is just fair.  The cover is a good protector, it is lightweight and does exactly what it says.  I recommend it very highly.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|Not a bad track on the entire album....the title of my review says it all....EXCELLENT! I am a long time fan of Gram Parsons, and although this singer songwriter has been compared to Gram, he has his own style, and I believe it is every bit as good, and with no dis-respect to GP maybe even better...
B005HSG3VK|5.0|In looking for a protective housing for my new Kindle Fire, the priority was low-bulk, general protection of the device around the house or in my purse, along with a stand. This cover meets my needs perfectly! Here's why I'm pleased: 1) snug and secure fit, 2) the elastic strap keeps the flap closed neatly, yet it's not cumbersome to open, 3) nice corner and edge protection, while leaving USB port and power button easily accessible, 4) props up in the built-in ridge for video viewing, 5) lightweight, and 6) beautiful, fun, bright (yes, bright!) pink which is easy to spot around the house or in my bag. Possibly a bit overpriced, but no regrets so far.

B0000029DD|4.0|[[ASIN:B0000029DD Grace]] This album was a must buy when I heard Jeff Buckley's cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Allelujah\\" on CKUA radio. So sweet and so pure! The rest of the album is a bonus.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is great for any age between a little kid and an adult! Mostly anyone that plays it loves it!
B000001EEN|4.0|Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert: After several months (not years) of Claptons' self imposed exile, Pete Townshend, Ronnie Wood, and Traffic got Eric performing again with this Concert.  This is a Historic concert, and an adequate concert, but not a great concert.  Eric is a little rusty, and the rest of the band only have a basic knowledge of most of the songs.  We can be very grateful however, that this CD doubles the size of the woefully short original LP.  This is a nice Four Star live album.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|Pink Floyd's final chapter is one of their best. The Final Cut and A Momentary Lapse were good but The Division Bell was their best album in a while. It's very different from Dark Side of The Moon or The Wall. If you want a rock album than I wouldn't recommend it, it's a lighter and more atmospheric adult contemporary genre. High Hopes is amazing and it's worth it just for that song. I saw it live on TV so than I bought the album, it's really good for the band being around for almost 30 years (it was from '94) and Roger Waters also left. It's not Dark Side Of The Moon or The Wall but it's still amazing and personally, I think it should have been on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time.
B00004S35Z|4.0|Stevie Wonder / Fulfillingness' First Finale: This is a good album in which Wonder scolds President Nixon (\\"You Haven't Done Nothing\\") and discovers Reggae Music (\\"Boogie On Reggae Woman\\").  This is a solid Four Star album.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is a beautiful design which weighs as little as possible, while protecting the Fire.  It also functions well as a stand if you are watching a movie.  The reason I said \\"ALMOST perfect\\" is that the strap which secures the cover will probably lose its elasticity after a couple years, but I won't know that for sure until the case is a couple years old.  Even then, the strap is not essential, and you could cut it off and do without a strap, or use an elastic band instead.  If the Fire is in your hand or your pocket, it's not going to open by itself anyway, so the strap is not an essential component.
B00002R0MC|5.0|Bob Marley / Songs of Freedom:  This elaborate four disk box gives an accurate history of Bob's music.  There is none better.  This, by its nature, means that not all the songs are good (as much of the early stuff is raw and poorly produced) but for anyone interested in this monumental musical figure, this is the box set to get.  This box does have all of Marley's greatest hits, but it does not replace the absence of his greatest albums (which you may find yourself buying as well).  a five star history lesson.
B001IF252M|5.0|This adapter is a must-have if you're an Apple Macbook user. It allows you to quickly and easily connect your display to an external monitor or projector via a VGA cable (not included). Make sure that your Macbook model features the Mini Display Port, as this is only available on newer Apple computers. Some of the older models feature a different connection and require a different adapter for VGA use. If you're unsure... simply click on the Apple logo in the top left corner of your screen and then select \\"About this Mac\\". This will bring up a screen that provides you the exact model # of your machine. From there, simply use Google to search for the specs on your model #.  Connecting it to your display:  After connecting this to your external display via VGA cable, you will need to share your computer screen in order for it to display properly. In order to do this:  1) Click on the Apple Logo in the top left corner.  2) Select \\"System Preferences > Display\\"  3) Click the check-mark next to \\"Share Display\\"

B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is hands down the best keyboard I have ever used! It is comfortable to use in both portrait and landscape and the advance settings make it easy to customize to your liking. I recently got the Galaxy Nexus and was trying to use the native Android 4.0 keyboard because of all the great reviews it got ... while it is a very good keyboard, I just missed my SwiftKey X! I was back in 4 days :-)<br />Now, the text prediction is UNREAL!! Borderline mind reading! It's scary good!

B0034G4P9E|5.0|Whether you are a sports fan, movie fan, or fight fan, Warrior should be at the top of your list for movies to watch. With well-developed characters, an emotional and touching story, and an intense tournament to end the movie (some scenes were so exciting that the hair on my arm was left tingling), no one should miss this movie.   I was expecting a great movie based on critics' reviews of this movie. I was not disappointed. Everyone that watched the movie with me agreed it was great and thoroughly enjoyed it (including 3 women of varying ages).   This is a modern day Rocky. While Rocky will always be a classic, I honestly believe Warrior outshines it in every aspect today.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Alright so I already loved her when I watched this. But seriously it's completely brilliant.  Her voice is one in a million, her songs are golden and this DVD is perfect.  Perfect.
B005HSL626|2.0|my 3 year old cousins happen to like the game. it has funny sound effects and everything, but the graphics could be better and I keep having issue with it suddenly turning off or getting a black screen that I cant seem to get out of. the adds are very obtrusive and a few are inappropriate for little kids. Overall I give it 2 stars. it could be much more fun if I could play the game without interruptions.
B0002YLC24|5.0|You know the saying about how even a broken clock is right twice a day? Well, for the purposes of my review, Before Sunset and its prequel Before Sunrise represent the two instances on the clock where romance films have been right. The rest of the time on the clock of course represents the times romance films have been maybe close but not spot on - or just flat out wrong. (Okay, that may be a little harsh - there have been a few other worthy romantic films in the recent past. But, in my opinion, none more focused or as gratifying as Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, especially taken together.)  First, a little background. Before Sunrise, the film set prior to the story that takes place in Before Sunset, is about an American twenty-something in Vienna who meets his mental counterpart and soulmate on the last day of his overseas vacation. After a singular night of intellectual and passionate connections, Before Sunrise ends with the two main characters - Jesse, played by Ethan Hawke, and Celine, played by Julie Delpy - parting ways yearningly and agreeing to meet up at a prearranged spot six months later. I won't explain the hows and whys as to their agreement - you should just see the film to answer those questions. Now, in Before Sunset, Jesse and Celine pick up nine years after their first encounter. The film moves in real time from the beginning of their second meeting until the credits roll, following Jesse and Celine as they glide along through their rediscovery - each intently focused on the other as they wander the footpaths of Paris. In doing so, the film thoughtfully explores where these characters were situationally and emotionally, where they now are, and where they may be headed.   The bottom line is that Before Sunset is a master work. There are other romantic films that have good things to offer, but none come to mind that approach the same level of psychological intimacy that these characters (and the audience) share, nor the same gratifying mix of character relatability, heartfelt longing, hope for the future, or romantic chemistry that this film has in spades. I loved the characters of Jesse and Celine - the fashion in which they intellectualize to make deeper connections; the obviousness of their mutual attraction barley held in place by the rules of societal etiquette; the way in which they disarm one another and ultimately forego all pretense to spill truths about their lives and their hopes - powerful, up close and personal stuff.  In closing, I will just say that romance isn't even close to my favorite genre - horror/sci-fi films, thrillers, and actioners tend to be my go-tos. This fact should provide a clue as to the level of regard that I hold for these films. I can't imagine a better way to satisfy a craving to indulge in cinematic romance than to gorge ravenously on the emotional sustenance that these films provide. Having viewed each of these films several times, I really look forward to the day when we revisit these characters once again in a definitive third film. Here's hoping that lightning will strike again, and that the proverbial broken clock will ignore all laws of time and space and be right three times a day. Until then, my advice to you is to set aside an afternoon to take a walk down the dappled avenues of Paris (and Vienna) with Jesse and Celine.

B002IFT1ZA|3.0|Being a long time fan of the series (since 2000), I eagerly anticipated the HBO adaptation being billed as 'the Sopranos in Middle Earth'.  Before starting the TV series, I tried to step back and rationalize that the characters simply weren't going to be the same as portrayed in the novels, and that certain plot elements just weren't going to be shown in the same way as in the novels.  Some, I feared, being omitted entirely.  To David Benioff (Troy, X-men Origins: Wolverine) and DB Weiss' credit, the show is shockingly consistent with the source material.  In fact, nearly every single relevant plot point from the novel was crammed into only a 10 episode saga.  This is both it's greatest triumph, and it's largest fault.  The problem is that the there's really too much going on for this story to work in this medium.  Dave and Dan have attempted to give this show a grand sweep in the style of Lord of the Rings, where a focused character driven narrative would have better served the story.  It's really a disservice to Martin, considering what really sets apart his epic, is the focus on the richness of character and their inner demons and potential for redemption.  In this manner, the TV show fails to connect it's viewership to the key characters.  Most of my friends, not familiar with the novels, were always asking me \\"wait, what just happened?\\" and \\"who was that blond chick on a different continent again, and why should I care?\\"  One must have almost an encyclopedic knowledge of the story before watching the show in order to keep up.  Which houses are friendly? Which kingdoms do they inhabit? How many out of wedlock children do they have?  All failings of the storytellers, unless it was the intention to write this story as fan service only.  When time was spent developing the characters and fleshing out their back stories, the acting nearly always falls flat.  Sean Bean (Eddard), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion), and Maisie Williams (Arya) all do an excellent job in their roles, but nearly everyone else is stoic and wooden at best.  The biggest failings are Jon (Kit Harrington) and Danerys (Emilia Clarke) who later serve to be the main characters in the series.  Jon in particular lacks the anger, resentment, and indecision that make his character so likable and complex in the novels.    There's also strange sexist undertones in the story, both in the novels and the TV series.  Arya may be then only female character in all of Westeros that hasn't been brutalized or raped. Oh, yeah, and in the show nearly all of the brutalization is done by people of color.  There's no explanation for the bizarre Dothraki sexual assult and murder rituals, and while true to the source material, this type of display only further enforces dated racial stereotypes.  In the end, the show's opening sequence ends up being the most memorable part of the TV series, and that should never be the case.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I'm a review junky so after reading countless reviews i decided to get this cooler for my i7 2600k as it was reaching temps of up to 98 degrees Celsius (which i believe is the TJmax temp for this processor) when under load with the stock cooler that came with the processor. Cooler master gives u everything you need for the installation and it was actually pretty easy (wit the help of youtube) though the instructions are quite terrible. Was done in about 10 mins and didnt have to remove my board as my case has a cut out at the back for heat sinks such as this one. Turned my pc on and my idle temp dropped from an average of around 47 degrees to 23 degrees celsius and thus far under load it hasn't passed 35 degrees as opposed to temps in the high 90's before. Believe i could probably shave some more degrees off if I used Arctic Cooling's MX4 Thermal paste as i had planned but im quite satisfied with performance of the paste Cooler Master provided. My stock sink's fan used to b reallly loud even over the sound of my 6 case fans but i cant hear the fan on this thing. Though it is pretty big it fits in my Thermaltake Dokr Case with an inch to spare. The fan covers one of my ram slots but as the fan can slide up I shud b fine using low profile sticks. Overall...excellent cooler at an AMAZING price so why spend more to get the same or less performance. You can't go wrong with this thing!

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King has won more wrting awards than I've written books -- and I've written a slew of them. 11/22/63 is his 50th work, but it's the first I've managed to read because I'd always associated him with horror stories, which I loathe. However, within the first few pages of this fascinating book I understood perfectly why King has won so many awards, as I found myself completely engrossed in the story.<br /><br />As a work of science fiction, 11/22/63 is a fairly straightforward exploration of time travel. King's protagonist, Jake Epping, 35, is a high school English teacher in a small Maine town when an acquaintance named Al tells him about the window or portal in time in the floor of the storage room in his diner. Al persuades him to step through the portal, which leads directly back to September 9, 1958. No matter how long Jake may stay in the past, only two minutes will have elapsed back home in 2011 when he returns. Al is dying and lures Jake into taking up the mission he himself had recently accepted: returning to 1958 and staying in the past for five years until he can track down and kill Lee Harvey Oswald before that watershed day in November 1963 when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.<br /><br />Working from detailed notes about Oswald that Al had accumulated in his own, futile attempt to hold out until 1963, Jake manages to talk himself into changing the history of the world. In the course of his five-year sojourn in the past, most of it in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, he meets and falls in love with a librarian at the small-town high school where he teaches to support himself. And that's about as much of the plot as I can share without spoiling the story.<br /><br />King has consummate skill both at narrative and at dialogue. His treatment of time travel is the most ingenious I've read despite my adolescent years as a sci-fi fan. The story races along, building tension and anticipation and, yes, the fear that embues any competent horror story. The climax and the resolution of the tale are satisfying. It's a real pleasure to read a consummately clever story by a masterful writer at the peak of his game.<br /><br />(From [...])solution of the tale are satisfying.

B004T5K3OK|5.0|My issues is not with the program, which is great, but with Amazon. This version is 1.1.2. When I wrote to the developer they said many of my questions were resolved in subsequent updates going up to version 1.3.1. But it is not available at Amazon, but is at Android Marketplace. But I can't update there because AM says I didn't buy it there. I queried Amazon and they give the canned response that they have to \\"test\\" it first and can't say when, if ever, I may see the update. Bottom line: if you want the most up to date and improved version of a program look elsewhere.  UPDATE:  After I wrote this I found an earlier review from Kura808 from Aug. It was spot-on. I deleted the free version, kept the license part, installed the free version from the Android Market and it instantly recognized program as full licensed version. It is now ver 1.3.1.20111220. Thank you Kura 808

B005D0RDIE|5.0|Having been listening to RUSH since the first self-titled album RUSH, my first live show I watched them during the Signals tour 1981?  I have caught every tour show since then as I have grown older and moved from Indy to KC now to Portland,with career and pursuit of happiness this band,its members never fail to inspire me in my personal goals as well as in my career goals to achieve as much happiness doing what I love more than any other type of input from people, books, or film.  The crowds include  so many people that truly value the musicianship , entertainment RUSH has always delivered equally and if not more than myself.  Geddy's vocals are better than ever , Alex in particular on this tour really brings out his guitar master playing with some very cool classical guitars, and old acoustic folk instruments ( lead in on Closer to the Heart in particular).  Neal as we have been so honored to always witness astounds us, with his drumming , deep thought lyrics , and what do you know the guys can act too ;)   Funny Funny Funny  Intro short films and Intermission Films  I actually ordered this DVD because I new these comedy skits were on this so so worth it.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I installed this on my phone and used it with no problems, until I imported my photos in. There was over 50 different album arts downloaded, most of which I never purchased and some was offensive. I don't know if this was a fluke or not but the way to see is  plug your phone into your computer, (make sure the USB connect is on Disc Drive on your phone) open up either drive E or F and look in amazon.mp3 and then look in a folder called image.pics or something similar, and look at all the .jpeg files ( you can safely delete the .jpeg files without screwing you phone/computer up).<br /><br />I like Amazon as a whole, but this in not right and we as buyers should be able to decide what we want on our devices, not someone else.<br /><br />This would be the perfect music player, except for this one flaw, so one star as I did not download any music with offensive album art.<br /><br />As always, with ANYTHING on a hard drive or something similar , do this at your own risk, I'm not responsible if you screw your device(s) up.
B000T433CO|4.0|Yes Christmas is that lonely scary time of the year and these characters give us the common stressors of modern singles going through it. Getting cheated on, lied to, used, abused, lonely, confused, it's all here! Yet the gloom is like a splash of cranberry juice in a sparkling holiday spritzer, as the feel of the movie is hopeful and bright and the pain just keeps it from being corny. This movie quickly became a standard in my classic holiday line up. Kate Winslet's performance was deeply moving to me personally and actually motivated me to do something about some long festering problems in my own life. I can't say many movies have moved me to act on my own behalf but this one has, so I have to acknowledge it's simple power.   I wasn't as impressed with Jude Law and Jack Black as I would like to have been, they both seemed rather awkward and miscast so that's why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Cameron Diaz is gorgeous of course and her wardrobe is lovely. There is an English cottage that looks as though it was lifted off of a Christmas card, which is always appropriate for a proper Christmas movie and the local pub made me thirsty. Half of the story is set in L.A. (and sorry to you L.A. dwellers) but I find L.A. very uninspiring but maybe that's was the point and I just didn't get it.
0802798225|4.0|Pros:  Likable characters (you might fall for Alex)  Good dialogue (unlike Nicholas Sparks, the conversation between characters doesn't make me cringe)  Hot scenes  Interesting plot (it's predictable, but you still can't stop reading and hoping that they will fall in love.)  Cons:  Too much spanish! It's is cute at first, but it becomes annoying. It's much worse in the 2nd and 3rd books. But sometimes you can't really totally figure out what the word means (I don't speak any spanish). Words like mamacita and chica are obvious, but some are less.  Unrealistic  Predictable  Stereotypical. How many times is he going to call her \\"mamacita?\\"   The fact that she taking every \\"ing\\" word that Alex says or thinks and takes off the G. It was so annoying to read that for the hundredth time.   **SPOILER ALERT**   The sex scene is awkward. I've seen worse but I had to bite my lip when I read it. For example,  \\"Thanks for breaking my fall.\\"  \\"I'm jokin', don't be shy with me.\\"   \\"Who am I kidding? The first time hurts for a girl, no matter how careful the guy is.\\"   \\"She holds my head in her hands and kisses my tear away.\\"  **  Although I gave it more cons than pros, I have to give it 4 stars because I read the book in about 2 days and when I finished it I didn't want it to be over. I found myself rooting for Alex and Brittany, and I just couldn't put it down. Despite it's flaws, \\"Perfect Chemistry\\" is worth the read.
B00007LTIA|4.0|As a Yes fan, I started out listening to this band with some of their more popular titles such as \\"Fragile,\\" \\"The Yes Album,\\" and \\"Close to the Edge\\" before listening to Tales. I heard about how critics and fans alike are polarized by this album and I can understand why. It is without doubt the most ambitious work Yes has ever done. I was a bit weary going into listening to this album thinking about the possibility of hating it. After I listened to it the first time, I thought, \\"Not bad.\\" After listening to it more I began to develop a love for the album. My favorite tracks are \\"The Revealing Science of God\\" (Side 1) and \\"Ritual\\" (Side 4). \\"Ritual\\" is probably one of the best prog rock tracks of all time even at about 22 minutes in length (almost 30 minutes live). If anyone is thinking about giving Yes a try, I would advise not to listen to this album first because it would most likely destroy their premature interest in the band. I would listen to \\"Fragile\\" first and then \\"Close to the Edge\\" next in order to understand the musicianship, styles and the lyrics of different types of songs the band does. I would give \\"Tales\\" a few listens before finally giving an overall grading of the album. I give it four stars. The only flaw I see this album is having rough transitions in instrumentation within the songs and that the songs are a tad bit long and some areas could have been cut. Overall, one of the best prog rock albums of the 1970s.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins, already established as one of the most influential management consultants, further established his credibility with the wildly popular Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...and Others Don't, originally published in 2001. The book went on to be one of the bestsellers in the genre, and it is now widely regarded as a modern classic of management theory.<br />Collins takes up a daunting challenge in the book: identifying and evaluating the factors and variables that allow a small fraction of companies to make the transition from merely good to truly great. `Great,' an admittedly subjective term, is operationally defined according to a number of metrics, including, specifically, financial performance that exceeded the market average by several orders of magnitude over a sustained period of time. Using these criteria, Collins and his research team exhaustively catalogued the business literature, identifying a handful of companies that fulfilled their predetermined criteria for greatness. Then, the defining characteristics that differentiated these `great' firms from their competitors were quantified and analyzed.<br />The resulting data are presented in Good to Great in compelling detail.<br /><br />Over the course of 9 chapters, Collins addresses a number of management, personnel, and operational practices, behaviors, and attitudes that are both conducive and antithetical to the good-to-great transition. One overarching theme that links together virtually all of Collins' arguments is the need to define a narrowly focused objective and field of competency and then focus all of the company's resources toward that area of strength. Repeatedly, Collins warns that straying too far from a company's established strengths is inimical to the attainment of greatness. Finally, Collins links the findings of Good to Great to the conclusions he reached in his previous book, Built to Last, which focused on the factors that define companies that survive in the long-term, meshing both sets of results into an overarching framework for enduring success. I found this to be a very useful book in my business!ng both sets of results into an overarching framework for enduring success. I found this to be a very useful book in my business!

B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|Good, fun CD that came in a good condition. It's nice to see the boys credited as writers for most of the songs too, it shows that despite how the band came to be, they actually care about making music.
0393330435|4.0|My initial thoughts about this book were critical because Woz was a bit over the top on letting the reader know how amazing he is. Putting his ego aside, the book was a good read. I had a decent understanding of the 70's computer movement but reading this book has really opened my eyes to what went on in those early days. If you were not around in 70's, this book will give you a good perspective of some of the cultural and technological nuances. Being 26, I can relate to some of these nuances even though I only got the tail end of it.<br /><br />Overall, I would say it's worth reading. It's not just a book for Apple fans either (even though I am one). I think any geek would find the information interesting to say the least. I recommend trying to read past all the self flattery and boasting, eventually it gets much more interesting.
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|This watch was ordered for casual wear but the very large face made it impossible to wear on a medium build.<br /><br />The large face overwhelms most wrists but would be great for larger framed builds. The face itself includes appealing chronograph functions with 60 second, 60 minute and 1/10th of a second subdials and a date function.  The band is a velvety material which was a seude-like material that was not favored by my husband.<br /><br />Overall, this was not a good choice for us but if you are looking for a large faced watch, this one is worth a second look.
B002T9H2MO|3.0|I thought it was a strange movie altogether.  An astronaut that lives in the moon for 3 years  leaves and his clones stay in the moon base.  One of the clones dies and no human doctor  could help him another clone goes back to Earth  without finishing his mission.  Very sad,very unlikely that it will ever happen  like that. I think the story is exagerated in   that sense,NASA again will NEVER allow a sole   astronaut in the moon to suffer by himself   and cloning won't happen anytime soon in the  U.S. since it is illegal.  Sounds unrealistic. Rockwell's acting is good,  not enough characters in the movie and not   much settings either I guess to avoid high  costs in the movie. The music was great,it  is what I liked the most. Still,it is a   movie that makes me too sad and I wonder  why it wasn't released in most theatres.  The sex scene was unnecessary,that is what  gave this film an R rating. I recommend to  people to see PLuto Nash,it is really funny  and the scenes of the cities in the Moon   are great and it is for all audiences.

1936850028|5.0|There's no denying that today's professional sports is more about spectacle and celebrity than athletic prowess, but Walter Rhein's \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" reminds us that there are still individuals displaying that irrepressible grit and determination to compete in a grueling sporting event like America's greatest cross-country ski race, the American Birkebiner or \\"Birkie\\" not just to win, but to push themselves towards becoming better human beings mentally and physically as a result of it. I have to be honest, until I read \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" I thought most skiers were just vain glorious types filled with too much irrational exuberance and reckless abandon, but what the hell do I know, I'm a couch potato. \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" totally dispels that misconception and is the story of one man's humble quest and disciplined hard work to become an athlete in the purest sense of the word. You'll enjoy reading \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" very much, if for no other reason than to get a feel for what a real Norman Rockwell America is like when the Birkie comes alive every year during the sub-zero winters of northern Wisconsin. Walter Rhein is an excellent story teller who writes with the \\"wit and wisdom\\" of a Mark Twain coupled with personal insights about human relations that are most entertaining and endearing. Rhein's Grandpa is a treasured hoot who epitomizes the humor inherent in this very kick ass event, the Birkie. Cross country skiers may never receive the adulation or financial compensation of a Peyton Manning or Tiger Woods, and the sport surely won't be replacing Monday Night Football any time soon, but I'll tell you this much after reading \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" you'll have a new found respect and admiration for what \\"real\\" athletes are all about. Take it from Walter Rheins, cross country skiing is not for the faint of heart, wannabes or weekend shushers encased in designer spandex. Highly recommended, well written, an excellent read. I have to say it, \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" restored my faith in the notion that what a mind conceives can be achieved. Hey, just read it and feel good about how life really is.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I Have been wearing this Invicta 9211 for about 7 months now and it is a great watch.  the thickness(height) of the case is right around 14 mm but i think it is a slightly thick watch for the diameter only being 40..further research has made me come to the conclusion that because the watch is a chronograph the body is thicker to accommodate a higher number of internal parts.  I use this watch while working at a restaurant and I have banged it on wall corners, subjected it to heat lamps (for short times) and also gotten all sorts of sludge grease and grime on it.  Not to mention water splashes and immersions of both hot and cold; the mineral crystal is not scratched and the watch looks awesome.  also went into the ocean with it and crashed a jeat ski and no problems. just wash off the salt right after being in the ocean to prevent rust.  i have nothing to say about the chronograph i turned it on like once and it just doesn't really interest me so i can't tell you anything about that, but it does keep very very accurate time    also an ex girlfriend gave me this watch so i have to get another watch just to have one that I purchased for me and not from her. Im also going for the non-chronograph, Submariner-like look with the Bulova 98B131 (just purchased it with overnight shipping for $177 here on amazon).  it has a screw in case back and screw in crown with 200M water resist, which are features i must need in a watch, and it is not a chronograph, which FOR ME is perfect.  im picky about watches--who isn't?.  I will still wear this invica, but the Bulova looks much nicer and it has a wider and slimmer case..most likely because the chronograph internals are absent, allowing the watch to be thinner, which is fine with me becuase im not a chronographer..i got an app for that on my smart phone??lol...but then there is the debate over quartz and automatic.  Yes autos are valued more but a quality japanese quartz is extremely accurate and i have heard just as accurate or very close to a very expensive auto (Brietling, Omega, Rolex)  and i cannot afford a $5000-10,000 quality diving auto, so quartz it is..also tried on the bulova 96B131 Precisionist at kay jewelers because people were saying it is big and it is.. it is pretty big watch with a very thick band and it is actually really heavy, but has the sweeping second hand which is cool

1451627289|5.0|This is in a class with his best novels (which were the early ones in my opinion.) It's suspenseful, but without the usual horror in his stories. His treatment of time travel has a unique slant, but is internally consistent and isn't too gimmicky. King's stories always start out well, though occasionally fizzle out (most notably It.) This one keeps up the pace and I particularly liked the way he ended it. One of his best endings. He even throws in a nod to It, when his main character encounters some of the kids from It. Overall, excellent.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This action packed film is amazing to watch in Blu-Ray. If you are a Batman fan then this is the film to watch. It displays great performances by each actor and is filled with tons action which will keep you entertained throughout the entire film.
B005FITIK0|4.0|Charlize Theron delivers another superb performance, this time as a thoroughly loathsome former high school Mean Girl hottie who still has the goods but begins to recognize how miserable and empty her life is. The solution? Revisit the wretched home town and snatch her old flame from the jaws of happily married new parent bliss.  Theron's character is an unrepentantly self absorbed, selfish, judgmental, and abrasive. Her saving graces are being pretty and witty (though she has to work at the pretty more than she used to and the witty is increasingly compromised by uncontrolled alcoholism). \\"Wise\\" is contributed by Patton Oswalt in an equally strong performance which holds the movie together and gives us understanding eyes to see Theron through. The friendship that grows between them give the movie an otherwise lacking heart and is crucial to keeping us involved.  It's really a story about someone failing at pretty much everything and lunging for what she perceives as her one shot at rescuing her life. And completely screwing that up.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is an amazing documentary that will educate you about something very basic, something that you do at least once a day, eat. The authors tell and show your where the food that most of us eat every day is coming from. Be egoistic an watch this documentary because there is nothing as intimate as eating.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|A story about being set adrift and trying to find your way back to life. Fine performances across the board with some characters developing unanticipated connections and unexpected depth. Not tremendous depth, but more than is apparent at first meeting. Still, the movie treads a lot of familiar territory with only slight diversions that don't go too far astray from the expected and with a few slightly exotic problems - just right for making a holiday movie-going crowd feel like they were challenged but safe while still delivering an above average film and a great cast for those who want more than safe holiday fare.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I bought the same set (BluRay, region free)from Amazon UK for $49 shipped.  Took a little while to get here(10 days)but it was worth saving $30.  Deathly Hallows 1&2 are the only ones that have an extras disc with them, the first 6 are the movies only.  I was worried a bit about a region free disc but  all discs play fine on my 3 Blu-ray players.
B003NFM3JK|4.0|With income-disparity at a level not seen since the turn of the last century, Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" has never seemed more timely and relevant in its spirit and message.  No longer just a quaint little tale from a distant past, the story, with its themes of unbridled greed and compassion for the poor, speaks with a renewed urgency to our current generation.<br /><br />So, polemics aside, how does the 2009 \\"motion-capture\\" animated version of this most famous of all stories stack up against the umpteen others we've seen over the course of a lifetime (including those featuring The Muppets and Mr Magoo)?  Very well, actually.  Robert Zemechis' movie remains generally faithful to the source material, and, while it provides us with a visually ravishing - almost snow globe-like - look at a wintry 19th Century London, it isn't afraid to confront the darker elements of the tale as well (as such, it might be a bit frightening for very young kids at times).  And while one could accuse it of going a trifle overboard in its search for the requisite 3-D sensation (as most of these films by their very nature are wont to do), the movie remains forever focused on the human heart that beats at the core of the work.<br /><br />Even in semi-animated form, Jim Carrey is so remarkable as the miser Scrooge (and the three main ghosts who visit him) that, in the spirit of the holidays, we're even willing to forgive him for his desecration of the Grinch a decade or so back.  And he's backed by a first-class cast that includes Robin Wright Penn, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Bob Hoskins, and Cary Elwes among others.<br /><br />All minor quibbles and qualms aside, you'd have to be a bah-humbugging Scrooge yourself to resist the charms of this movie.
0385534639|4.0|\\"The Night Circus\\" is a rare book -- it is fiction, it is fantasy, it is fairy tale, it is a circus tale, and it is a magical romance. Erin Morgenstern's debut novel is one of those rare stories that simply grabs your imagination and refuses to let go -- full of haunting magical experiences and eccentric characters, but also in need of some editorial trimming at times.<br /><br />In the vein of \\"The Prestige,\\" there are two children in the blossoming time of the Gilded Age, and only room for one of them. Celia is a born magician -- she is left at Le Cirque des Reves with Prospero the Entertainer, a place of strange people and even stranger magics.<br /><br />And Prospero conspires to create the greatest magical battle in history by pitting young Celia against her only rival, Marco. Like Celia, Marco was a child of great power, abandoned because of it and groomed by a weird man. You can probably guess where this magical concatenation of Shakespeare and magic is going: the two kids fall in love, and try to be together despite the destined battle they have been groomed for.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern is undeniably a richly talented writer -- she crams this story full of eerie happenings, odd characters, drifting smoky magic, and fairy-tale atmosphere that happens to be set in the middle of a strange, almost dangerous circus. Perhaps \\"The Night Circus'\\" biggest flaw is that it needs a little editorial pruning, in some spots that needed a little less description.<br /><br />The romance here feels pleasantly organic -- Morgenstern lets them drift together and intertwine in the context of the story, avoiding instant super-passion or big flashy displays. It burns slow and soft as it goes on, and feels all the richer because it avoids \\"Twilight\\"-style theatrics and hyperbole. But hanging over it all the time is the creepy, dark threat to the two young magicians.<br /><br />And the magic is much the same, seeping into the pages like a rich scent. This story is slow, subtle and shimmering, like diamond-studded velvet floating through the air, and the inclusion of steampunky technology (trains, electric lights, industrial factories) merely highlights the magic.<br /><br />Both Celia and Marco could have used a little more polishing, but they are likable lead characters, and you do want them to find their happily-ever after. But the truly engaging characters are the rich supporting casts -- Tsukiko the contortionist, the twins, a weird clockmaker, and the manipulative mentors of the two young magicians.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern casts a spell over the reader, sweeping us into the sensual beauty of the \\"Night Circus\\" -- and leaving us craving more stories set in her enchanted world.g through the air, and the inclusion of steampunky technology (trains, electric lights, industrial factories) merely highlights the magic.

0142419192|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I was in a reading rut and itching for something different but didn't know what.  I picked this book out because of the cover and the concept on \\"night circus\\" personifies something dark, so I snatched it up and fell in love!  This book was great!  The old, the new and the characters mixed in between were so wonderfully blended this book was what I needed for a fresh change.  This book reminded me of why I enjoy reading so much, because you get to go to someone else's world and sometimes that is just great place to be!  Nothing sensual about this book just pursuit of good and evil, with a hint of romance and great closure at the end.  This book will be a keeper.

B004LWZW4C|4.0|I put off seeing this movie in the theater because I so love Ian McKellen as Magneto and Patrick Stewart as the Professor and I wondered if I could accept a different, younger actor in the roles I had so connected to those great performers. And while I still think Stewart and McKellen cannot be bested when it comes to their mutant roles, the first class was enjoyable.  It was nice to see how these character originated and to meet new mutants (Havoc and Darwin were great) and I was impressed with January Jones and even though I generally don't like Kevin Bacon, he did do a nice job in this movie.  I had issues with Angel (because, honestly, she looked like a dragonfly and not remotely frightening) and Mystique. While I thought Jennifer Lawrence did an OK job, I just didn't buy that she grew up to be the Mystique we know from earlier films. I guess that's the trouble with a prequel of such a successful triology. Also the Hugh Jackman cameo was hysterical.  If you were a fan of the first 3 movies I would recommend seeing this. It only adds a new dimension of enjoyment with this series.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I already saw the Complete Dr. Who 6th series on BBCAmerica. Now I own it so I can watch it again. I enjoyed watching it very much and I know I will enjoy watching it again.  I loved all of it. Matt Smith makes a great Dr. Who. He is very funny and humorous, and sometimes you see some anger also. I like Karan Gillian as Amy Pond, the Dr's Companion. She is great also. They are very good together. Alex Kington is great as River and there is Rory who plays Amys husband. If you have not seen it yet, you won't be disappointed when you do see it. Listen carefully and try and figure out whats going on. Lots of twists and turns. I loved it all. For those of you who only liked David Tenant as Dr Who, don't forget, he made the decision to stop playing Dr. Who. So they had no choice but to pick someone else to play the part and I think that Matt Smith fits the Dr. Who character just fine. I really like him. When people speak negatively about him because they only like David Tenant.....they have to remember he no longer wants to be the Dr. and I'd say to them, just don't watch if you don't like Matt Smith. Quit knocking the guy. A lot of us have accepted him as the new Dr. Who and he's doing a great job at it . . . . . Go Matt Smith.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone! I started this book and finished the third book in a matter of a few days. You would think that being a teen book it would be less appealing to any older generation, but in fact I am 27y/o and was recommended to read it by someone a few years older than I. I'm normally a romance novel kinda person but this little series gave me a whole new view of what else is out there. Through the entire book (actually through all three books) the auther gives you a visual of what all the surroundings look like, what the people look like, the feelings that the story teller is having and so on, you get the idea. It was so real and intense that I was actually having dreams about it! It's suspenseful, heroic, dramatic, passionate, and I could go on and on. I'm actually thinking about reading it again soon!.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|This movie explores a part of history that I did not realize occurred - the round up of Jews by the French government. I found myself mesmerized not only by the story but the acting. It is perfectly cast. And yes it is about  WWII, and the concentrations camps,  and it is sad, but still a story that needs to be told and retold. Worth seeing. It is in English as well as French (with subtitles) . I would recommend viewing this film to anyone.

B0062NAX1U|1.0|I saw this `Courageous' film when it came out and I have to say that it's not that great. I own hundreds of Christian movies (including `Flywheel', `Facing the Giants,' and `Fireproof'), so I know for a fact that Sherwood movies \\"borrow\\" plenty of material from films made by Russ Doughten Films (All The King's Horses, Home Safe, Heaven's Heroes, Sammy, etc.) and Ken Anderson Films (Living Legends, The Answer, God Owns My Business, My Son My Son, etc.). Now, its message of urging fathers to be real fathers and be in the lives of their children is important, but this movie just drags on and on. It's over 2 hours long! People were already falling asleep in the theater. This movie should have been shorter and to the point.   The main reason why I'm giving this movie a \\"one star\\" is because this movie promotes worldly living. Yes, the main character and his daughter listen and dance to worldly (as in NOT Christian) music in some scenes. Moreover, this movie just focuses on human efforts to try to be a better father, not the concept of living a HOLY LIFE. I don't think I even heard the words \\"sin\\" or \\"repentance\\" in this movie. I'm surprised that ABSOLUTELY no one in the internet has talked about that.  In sum, this film promotes a compromised, lukewarm Christianity, which is typical in the South, and I will NOT be buying it.   This movie also deserves a \\"one star\\" for its negative and stereotypical portrayal of Latinos. Though it can be considered \\"funny\\" at times by some, it's simply disrespectful. Apparently, in Latino households families only eat rice, beans, and tortillas; the wife stays at home to take care of the kids and is demanding and whines a lot; the man works in factory or in construction and, because of his machismo, can't cry in front of the children; and the parents speak with strong accents and are on this country illegally or under some sort of conditional status, among many things. For instance, one of the first things that the main character asks theLatino character after meeting him is, \\"Do you have a work permit?\\" I mean, I guess that, as a Latino, he couldn't be a citizen or permanent legal resident; he had to be the typical Latino day laborer with a Work Authorization Card who has Temporary Protection Status (TPS) or is \\"working\\" on getting his papers or adjusting his status.    On a side note, Sherwood Baptist Church, which produced this movie, works aggressively with Catholics to promote its movies to help \\"bring America back to God.\\" As any person who studies the Bible and is Spirit-lead knows, the Roman Catholic church has issues, to say the least; so this church either lacks spiritual discernment or has none at all. In addition, like the vast majority of Baptist churches, this church also believes in the doctrine of Eternal Security. This doctrine implies that once you are saved, you are ALWAYS saved. Simply put, you can't lose your salvation. It's no wonder we have so many famous Baptists in this country who don't live a holy life (Bill Clinton, Whitney Houston, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, etc.). However, the Bible clearly refutes this doctrine and states that \\"without holiness no one will see the Lord.\\" In addition, Sherwood Baptist people, even though they deny it, promote the prosperity gospel in some of their movies. For instance, in the film \\"Facing the Giants\\", after deciding to turn to God, the football coach gets a higher salary, a free new car, wins state titles, and even becomes fertile. Now, this series of miracles is amazing given the fact that this church rejects the Baptism in the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues, and the gifts of the Spirit, among many things.

0385534639|4.0|A fabulous debut novel that follows the lives of two magicians, Celia and Marco, who are destined to compete against one another with the circus as backdrop.  This novel is beautifully written with exceptional detail of setting and development of its main characters.  Once I got rolling on this book I found it hard to put down.  I was hesitant to initially pick it up as it is a blend of fantasy and a love story, two genres I rarely read.  I completed it in four days which should serve as a testament to how good this book is.
1451627289|5.0|Standing in line with my Mom at the Cala Market in Corte Madera in 1975, I picked up \\"Carrie\\" and I. Could. Not. Put. It. Down. I was 14 and had read all of Lovecraft, Bloch, most of August Derleth, but after 2 years of intense pre-adolescent study, I'd abandoned the horror genre for my first love, sci-fi. King was a revelation - characters I cared for, genuine scares - even a decent \\"sensahuma.\\"    Since then me and Steve-o have had our ups ('Salems Lot, The Shining, and oh god, The Stand) and our downs (Cujo, It, Under the Dome) but his rhythms have become as comfortable as my first rock concert T-shirt. One of King's problems, though is his insistence on resurrecting stillborn manuscripts that should never have drawn breath-these were great as practice runs, but one shouldn't try to salvage EVERYTHING.  (I get the sense that Dome was one of those endeavors.) His most recent works where he's started fresh but with 50 years of practice behind him, are now the best. This book is one of them.
0061537969|3.0|I really enjoyed this book as it is not the typical.  Speaking from the \\"3rd person\\" it gives you a different, suprisingly good perspective.  It got a little wierd in the middle, adding the \\"twist\\", perhaps a little too over the top for me which is why it got a 3 rather than a 5.  I love dog books but due to the \\"twist\\" it changes who I would recommend the book to.

B002ZG980U|1.0|I'm glad I did not pay much for this DVD, but this movie was not only terrible, but it was very long.  Imagine a sensationalized sci fi movie trying to be like the matrix, but without much creativity.  It was hard to take Leonardo seriously because every time he screamed, you half expected him to scream for Rose (e.g. Titanic).  His voice and persona were about the same.  Again, a very boring movie, that was too long and took itself too seriously.
B005F96URI|5.0|Bunraku is awesome. I loved how all of the settings looked like pages out of a pop-up book. :) It's like the Sin City movie had a love child with the Scott Pilgrim movie.  The action was good. I was actually on the edge of my seat to find out if the main characters would live or die in the final battle. And there were certain scenes where so much was going on that I really want to watch the whole movie a second time (like tomorrow) so I can pay attention to some of the background stuff that I think I missed while I was paying attention to the foreground stuff. I know it got kind of crappy reviews, but I loved it!    Bunraku = 5 stars, in my book.   The plot wasn't the most complex, but the acting was good and the battle scenes were cool.  If you like \\"typical\\" movies and only typical movies, then Bunraku is not for you.  But if you want your senses to be engaged and the creative part of your brain to be stimulated from start to finish, then you should definitely check out this movie.    Josh Hartnett, Gackt, and Woody Harrelson made for a fun trio.  And Gackt really is evolving as an actor.  I enjoyed him in [[ASIN:B0001WTWII Moon Child]], but I think that he dug deeper for this role.    ***  Parental advisory--possible spoilers ahead (I tried not to give anything away, though):  As for sex, violence, etc...There is no nudity or sex in the movie at all.  There is a bit of dialogue that implies the duties of a concubine, but not graphically or in any real detail whatsoever.  The characters do drop several F-bombs.  There aren't any really scary or frightening scenes, at least not any that I think anyone would find frightening. Two of the main characters and several minor characters are seen smoking throughout most of the movie.  Most of the characters are seen drinking alcohol at some point.  One of the characters visits an absinthe den and is served a glass of absinthe, but is not seen drinking it; it is implied, however, that the character had been there for a while and was already somewhat intoxicated.  There is a lot of violence in the movie because there are a great many fight scenes.  However, there are no guns in the entire movie.  The characters fight using martial arts, brass knuckles, swords, axes, knives, sticks, spears, arrows, bats, etc.  There is not a whole lot of gore, though.  There are a few instances where deaths are slightly graphic.  Several characters get their throats slit, a couple get hit with an axe (one in the head), a few are impaled by swords/spears, and one character is stabbed in the eye.  The blood and gore was not over the top, but I don't think it was too mild, either...just right in my opinion.  :)    Hope this helped!

B005HI4LMS|5.0|I put off buying this movie for a while to let the reviews pile up. I was originally on the fence in terms of purchasing, I've made some bad decisions on buing this type of movie in the past. Usually the movie is portrayed to be hilarious in the previews and you get it and the rest of the movie minus what you have already seen in the previews sucks. Usually not worth buying in the $5 bin at your local Walmart.<br /><br />THIS MOVIE IS NOT THE ABOVE MENTIONED CRAP<br />AWESOME! NON STOP LAUGHS!<br />I wasn't dissapointed one bit!<br /><br />This movie had me laughing from the beginning. Well done on all sides, character developement was spot on too, usually there is an overboard on one group, either protagonist or antagonist is horribly under-developed.<br /><br />The story is written so you can honestly side with the college kids being scared out of their minds. Not hard to do ever since Deliverance. But the movie doesn't rely on dark shots and creepy lurking to make you feel that way like a traditional horror movie would, in part because it's not a straight up horror movie it's actually a Comedy with blood and guts but not so much it's annoying. It has a sunny and happy disposition almost the whole way through despite the communication issues between Tucker, Dale and the College kids.<br /><br />You really do have to feel bad for Tucker and Dale being stereotyped as axe weilding psychopaths. It's really not their fault they're hillbillies born in raised in WV. But that's what makes this movie so great, the expected stereotype and how these two simple country folk deal with their situation.<br /><br />\\"This vacation sucks!!\\"
B001EN71DG|1.0|I've been praying a long time.<br /><br />Until Mr. Lucas decides that the originals deserve better (UNALTERED) treatment, I won't be paying him one red cent of my money. I grew up with the originals, and they still satisfied and amazed me, much as many films in my childhood did. You don't need CGI or added effects to appease your dwindling fanbase, and it's been largely proven that children don't even care as much about this.<br /><br />What it comes down to is money, and Mr. Lucas is a legend of film. Why he can't give the series better treatment by preserving the original cinematic artwork is beyond me.<br /><br />Perhaps in a few more years, he'll have learned his lesson that abandoning fans is really not a good idea. Not like he cares...he's raised a whole new generation of fans who are more than happy with the prequels and the newly added effects.<br /><br />I just wish he'd stop taking a dump on the fans who made his career what it is.

B000002UD1|5.0|It's kind of ironic that the title track Mind Games is the only single that came from this masterpiece, as it could be my least favorite song on the album, yet this is the only song people generally know off it. Why aren't \\"Out of the Blue\\", one of his most amazingly personal and touching songs, \\"Only People\\", one of his catchiest, \\"Bring on the Lucie (Freda People),\\" again, totally brilliant, \\"I know (I know)\\"--God it's so good--why aren't any of these greatest hits? Because that's what they are. Then there's \\"intuition\\" and \\"One Day (At a Time),\\" both sweet little tunes, and \\"Tight A$\\" and \\"Meat City\\", both rockers, and the other touching songs, \\"Aisumasen (I'm sorry) and \\"You are Here\\"--there is not a dud on here. \\"Nutopian International Anthem\\" is maybe not as strong, but it's definitely not weak either. And as an added bonus, no Yoko. The song \\"Mind Games\\" IS good; it's just sad to see, with that one exception, that pretty much every song here is a classic but completely ignored on all his greatest hits albums. I only found it because I collect all Beatles stuff and definitely all Lennon and Harrison. It took me a while to finally give this album a good listen, but it's changed my life. How did my parents' generation let this one get away?   By the way, \\"Out of the Blue\\" is covered by a lot of people on YouTube and not bad either. Not Lennon though.
B006ISJQBM|4.0|Johnny Depp plays reporter Paul Kemp in Hunter S. Thompson's the Rum Diary. The movie borderlines on insanity as Kemp becomes drunk and drunker in a 1960s Puerto Rico. While not as manic as the other Hunter S Thompson films the Rum Diary has it's own narrative rhythm. Paul meets his eccentric coworkers, gets drunk, has crazy adventures, gets drunker etc. Johnny Depp's acting is good, one gets to see an interesting portrait of a writer trying to find his voice while he is trying to get plastered.  There are undercurrents of Hunter S. Thompson present in Depp's portrayal of Kemp which starts bubbling to the surface near the end. there are funny antics going throughout the movie just not nearly as sporadic as the other two. all in all the movie is good and if you are a Johnny Depp fan Or a Hunter S. Thompson fan check this movie out and see if it can entertain you.

B005FITIK0|4.0|An original movie with a different presentation of the idea of rural v. urban. Heretofore, urban lifestyles have, more often than not, been cool, this movie has a different characterization of urban anonymity.  Sure it was bleak for Mavis, the urban big city girl but it was unusual since it turned the contemporary cultural idea of cool girl, single in the city, on its head in that Mavis from Minny Apples(Minneapolis) was not happy and the simple people who stayed home in their small town to simply live and die were. For the last forty years we have been presented with cosmopolitan urbanity as the ne plus ultra of a life well lived while the stay-at-homes who know each others business are just shucking hicks. The movie was unusual in that it presented the small towners as healthier, happier and less conflicted than the highly experienced, all too urbanly jaded Mavis.  In the end I wondered whether Mavis, who, in the middle of the movie, had commented about 'people who feel nothing' was just on a foray to her roots to find some different material for her writing.

B006G2ZEV6|5.0|Great-looking spin on the tower defense genre...Could probably call this part of the \\"Invasion\\" genre as now you get to control the army that is trying to get from Point A to Point B through the tower defenses of the enemy. But as another reviewer stated, around mission 5, the kindle starts to freeze and needs to be booted (holding the power button in for 20 seconds or so) in order to get out of the frozen game screen. Soon as a patch comes through, I will happily revise the review to the five stars it deserves!  1-16-12 edit:  And here I am much later, the bug has been fixed and it works just fine now! My 3 star review is now a 5 star review. Get it. Looks great and plays better now!

B004LWZW4M|5.0|Just finished watching this movie ten minutes ago. Must post about it while the movie is still fresh!!! The movie is completely awesome!<br />I suppose we all remember watching Mark Wahlberg and his role in the first of recent Planet of the Apes, and where the ending is like, \\"How the hell did all those apes show up with police cars and what the hell happened to the humans if he landed safely on THE planet Earth? Well, this movie kinda explains how it happened.<br />The other reviews go deep into one of the apes dying in the lab and how James Franco takes a baby ape home and how it grows up at his house with extreme intelligence while Franco is testing out a drug that can somehow help cure Alzheimers which his father has. But here is what didn't seem to be explained. The new ape, Caesar, is taken away by Animal Control after he manhandles a neighbor that was going after John Lithgow(playing Franco's father)because Lithgow in the throes of Alzheimers, accidentally takes the neighbor's Mustang and rams it between two parked cars while trying to drive away. Franco is desperate to get his chimp out of the Animal Control prison and Caesar grows more bitter and angry as time goes by, so by the time Franco is finally able to free him, Caesar refuses to leave, instead preferring to bust out with his army of apes and chimps after they have a go at the guard, which I had no idea played Draco Malfoy in Harry Potter, than busting out other captive chimps at the lab and the zoo and moving through downtown San Francisco.<br />I thought that the apes would lay waste to the entire city somehow and take out their revenge on humans, but Caesar seems content to not have his small army, which is anywhere from 300 to 500, attack anyone who doesn't deserve it. The battleground between apes and humans is played out along the Golden Gate Bridge, where the apes battle the police and state troopers and do it quite successfully. To avoid being shot down like fish in a barrel, the apes maneuver around the wires holding the bridge and the metal structure underneath, push an overturned bus as cover against a defense line of over 50 cops, and then OVERRUN the entire police line with lightning speed. The cops never had a chance against this kind of fight! It leaves you riveted and wanting to see more, especially when one large ape sacrifices himself in taking out a helicopter, but all THIS just so they can make a new home in the forest outside the city that Caesar recognizes from his earlier visits with Franco??? I'm kinda wondering about what kind of end that was until a part is shown in the closing credits.<br /><br />A scene in the movie shows that one of the scientists falls prey to a virus that was developed in the lab, part of the virus that supposedly brought intelligence to apes, and is found dead in his residence after he sneezes his germs on an alarmed neighbor. In the closing credits, this neighbor of his turns out to be an airline pilot that is starting to come down with it in the airport, and he brings that infection to Paris, which gets sent to Africa, Asia, and so forth. I would've liked to see some ending scenes with that virus bringing down the world, but the disease trails lighting up every continent on a global map of the Earth shows proof enough.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the movie didn't last longer than it's intended 1 hour and 45 minutes. It seems like it's a movie that requires much further detail that could've been brought into it and how the world further came to an end of it's human population, but it's still good for my 5 stars!he wires holding the bridge and the metal structure underneath, push an overturned bus as cover against a defense line of over 50 cops, and then OVERRUN the entire police line with lightning speed.

B001AW156U|5.0|I dont know why they have the gioteck triggers pictured, maybe because its what they sold at first ,but the PDP (Pelican) or ORB triggers like i received are comparable to the giotecks, i have a set of gioteck triggers on another controller and the ORB triggers fit just as well ,have almost the same feel and size, this is one of the easiest ways for someone with bigger hands to make the DS3 controller more comfortable to use.   Another thing i like to use along with these on my controller, are a set of Kontrol Freek CQC toggle covers, along with the real triggers, they end the DS3 \\"CLAW\\"   In my opinion, these are a must have for first person shooters for people with medium to large hands.

1439153663|3.0|I am a fan of historical fiction and read this book because of the superb ratings.  However, I have to say it was not what I expected.  There were times I found it difficult to continue reading because it felt very flat to me, but did find I couldn't put it down after awhile.  There is a lot of excitement and drama and I had high hopes for a great ending.  But what I didn't like about it was it seemed a little over the top -- much like watching a daytime soap opera.  I also wished there was more written about the time period, which beyond the style of clothes, the food and some other visual descriptions was totally absent. I appreciated the look at slavery and the terrible situation the main character had at the time (as  women).  But I just kept waiting for someone to do something or come up with a brilliant plan.  Instead the train wreck just kept getting worse and worse and the drama kept growing.  It is a book that starts out with some sad and a lot of happy but then becomes horribly, terribly, depressing and miserable.

0525423281|5.0|I need to admit something before I write this review: I've never read Anna and the French Kiss.  I feel like I should be hanging my head in shame because it seems like everyone and their grandma has read that book.  I have two copies of it in my classroom and I started reading it over the summer, but for some reason I stopped.  And never picked it back up.  Then I kept seeing the buzz for Lola and the Boy Next Door all over Twitter and won a copy, so I figured, okay I'll give it a shot.  That was last night and I finished it this morning. I have so much love for this book!<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is awesome and lives up to the hype I kept hearing and reading.  I was up until almost 3am reading this book and I didn't want to stop.  It's been months since a book has kept me up that late.  I forced myself to set the book down so I could sleep for a few hours before picking it up again and finishing it.  I do need to mention that Lola's story is a companion to Anna and the French Kiss, but even though I now know how that book ends, I was fine reading Lola and the Boy Next Door first.  Also, I'll be sure to finish Anna's story very soon.<br /><br />One of the first things I liked about this novel is that Lola starts off speaking about some wishes she has and one of them is that she wishes her parents would like her boyfriend.  As she goes on, she mentions her dad and her other dad.  It took me a minute to figure out that she has gay parents.  Perkins did a wonderful job creating this element of Lola's life without making it a big focus in the story.  It's completely natural and accepted; her dads are protective, loving, and funny.  It makes me happy to see this in YA because it should be in YA, especially the way Perkins infuses it into the story without making a big fuss about it.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading Lola's dads, Andy and Nathan, but I adored Lola.  She's quirky and creative while trying to be mature and older than she is.  She loves expressing herself by dressing in costume, which reminded me a little of Cyd Charrise, Rachel Cohn's main character in the Cyd Charrise series.  Not every girl will connect with this part of Lola's character, but they will connect with how she still sometimes worries about what other people think of her.  She's dating a much older guy, which adds an interesting spin to the story because Lola not only focuses on their relationship, but she also worries that she isn't mature enough for him.  Add to the fact that her boyfriend is a musician that travels and isn't loved by her parents, and you have a strong story element to go along with the arrival of Cricket.<br /><br />Lola is on uneven ground with her current relationship, so Cricket and Calliope moving in next door (again) only makes matters worse because of her history with them.  This is where I had one issue because Lola mentions problems she had with Calliope when they first lived next door, but those problems are never really explained.  Granted, it's not a focal point in the story, but I would have liked to have known more about them.  Cricket and Lola were close friends until something happened that broke Lola's heart and he and his family moved away.  With his reappearance, Lola isn't sure anymore about her feelings for him or her boyfriend.<br /><br />Perkins did a wonderful job writing Lola because I often felt the same way she did.  At times I was rooting for her to stay with her boyfriend, but once I got to know Cricket, I kept wanting her to dump her boyfriend and move on.  Cricket is in his freshmen year of college, but often comes home to help out and be with his family.  He's an inventor and on the cool side of nerdy, which I love.  Plus, he loves Lola for who she is, crazy outfits and wigs and all.  Cricket is adorable, smart, honest and an all-around good guy.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is about Lola deciding between two guys, but it's also about Lola figuring out who she is and if she's okay with who she is.  It's about her forming stronger friendships and relationships with her family.  It's also about first love and what that really is.  I laughed, swooned and even teared up while reading.  I hope you're able to get a copy pronto!relationships with her family.  It's also about first love and what that really is.  I laughed, swooned and even teared up while reading.

B000002A3T|4.0|I know that this totally ruins my credibility, but this was my first Pink Floyd album.  I know!  Please don't shoot me!!  Anyway, I grew up in a home where this type of music was evil, druggie music so my first introduction to PF was the \\"High Hopes\\" video on MTV.  I was 17 at the time, the song sounded great, and I bought the album the next day.  I thought the album was really good.  Of course, since then, I have bought other Floyd albums, Dark Side, the Wall, which are both fantastic and iconic.  As I got older, and grew out of my \\"only punk rock music\\" phase, I rediscovered this album and loved it even more.  I hear/read so many people bashing this album, and I don't understand why.  The music and melodies are good, and contains some great songs, period.  It does feel kind of like a David Gilmour solo project...but that's not bad.  I prefer david's voice over roger's, and his guitar work is always spectacular.  I know it's not \\"ummagumma\\" or \\"piper\\", but this album was released in the 90's, almost 30 years later, and the members 30 years older.  I was a teenager 20 years ago, I don't look the same, talk the same, act the same, I have different priorities, and have a different motivation in life.  The same thing is true for most rock bands (rolling stones, pearl jam, metallica).  Things change, inspirations change, dudes age...it's inevitable.  I can understand why some people might not like this album because syd or roger's influence are absent, but overall I think this album is great (not Floyd's best), but a great listen nonetheless.  Anyway, that's my 2 cents.  Check it out for yourself.

0817439390|5.0|I've only gotten through the first chapter so far but I have learned more in that one chapter than from any of the other photography books I have.  But the kicker is - I UNDERSTAND! I understand how to use Manual mode and I am anxious to start to practice.  (as I finish reading the rest of the book).  Before picking up this book, I knew what shutter speed was, I knew what aperture was, I knew about ISO and I knew they all had to work together - I just didn't know how to make them play nice.  Understanding Exposure has given me the knowledge to get the correct exposure. With this basic mechanic, now I can move forward and learn when shutter speed or aperture should prevail, how to see, frame and compose a shot.  I feel like I've hit the photography jackpot - I understand the mechanics and can now concentrate on learning the artistic.

B005OK725M|4.0|French writer, producer, and director Luc Besson reinvented the killer chick flick genre back in 1990 with his stylist shoot'em up \\"La Femme Nikita.\\" Before \\"La Femme Nikita\\" illuminated screens, the best killer chick flicks came from a variety of directors, actresses, and genres. Low-budget, indie director Ted V. Mikels helmed \\"The Doll Squad\\" (1973) and \\"Ten Violent Women\\" (1982). African-American actress Pam Grier empowered women in such B-movie classics as \\"Big Doll House\\" (1971), \\"Coffy\\" (1973), \\"Foxy Brown\\" (1974), and \\"Friday Foster\\" (1975). In 1973, future Nancy Reagan astrologer Joyce Jillson starred in \\"Super Chick\\" as an airline attendant named Tara B. True who held a black belt in karate and thwarted a jet hijacking. Another African-American actress Tamara Dobson top-lined \\"Cleopatra Jones\\" (1973) and \\"Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold\\" (1975). Most of these movies drew their inspiration from Asian actioneers where women wielded lethal weapons without a qualm, like \\"Female Demon Ohyaku\\" (1968), \\"Okatsu the Fugitive\\" (1969), \\"Quick-draw Okatsu\\" (1969), \\"Blind Woman's Curse\\" (1970) and \\"Lady Snowblood\\" (1971). At the same time, the Japanese produced the \\"Zero Woman\\" franchise of shoot'em ups in the Pinky Violence Collection featuring: \\"Delinquent Girl Boss: Worthless To Confess\\" (1971) \\"Girl Boss Guerilla\\" (1972) , \\"Criminal Woman: Killing Melody\\" (1973), and \\"Terrifying Girls' High School: Lynch Law Classroom\\" (1973). Before the violent Asian costume thrillers and the occasional American crime melodrama, only denim-clad dames in westerns such as \\"Johnny Guitar\\" (1954), \\"Two-Gun Lady\\" (1955), \\"Gunslinger\\" (1956), and \\"Forty Guns\\" (1957) were allowed to pack pistols.<br /><br />\\"Le Femme Nikita\\" propelled the genre into the 1990s but focused primarily on contemporary professional women armed with a modern arsenal of firepower. Not-surprisingly, clones proliferated: \\"Tank Girl\\" (1995), \\"Cherry\\" (2000), \\"The Silencer\\" (2000), and \\"Thelma and Louise (1991). In \\"La Femme Nikita,\\" the eponymous anti-heroine was a convicted gal slated for execution who received a second chance at life if she performed executions for the government. Besson's charismatic thriller starred newcomer Anne Parillaud and spawned a Hollywood remake, \\"Point of No Return\\" with Bridget Fonda as well as a Hong Kong version \\"Black Cat\\" (1991). Later, Besson made \\"The Professional\\" (1994) where an expert hit man, Jean Reno, taught a young girl, Natalie Portman, to how to kill the dastards who had murdered her parents. A cable television series \\"La Femme Nikita\\" with Peta Wilson appeared from 1997 to 2001. In 2010, another version of \\"La Femme Nikita\\" hit the small screen with Maggie Q cast in \\"Nikita.\\"<br /><br />Cleverly, Besson has recycled some of the best scenes from both \\"La Femme Nikita\\" and \\"The Professional\\" to make \\"Colombiana.\\" Sexy Zoe Saldana of \\"Avatar\\" stars as a sympathetic but indestructible female assassin who seems prepared for every contingency. Make no mistake; the filmmakers treat the theme of female empowerment in this seasoned but Spartan saga with few surprises but a surplus of sizzle. If you've seen either \\"La Femme Nikita\\" and/or \\"The Professional,\\" you can spot the inspiration for \\"Colombiana.\\" An early scene in \\"La Femme Nikita\\" depicts the heroine plunging a pencil into a policeman's hand. Similarly, an early scene in \\"Colombiana\\" shows our childish heroine stabbing a villain and pinning his hand to a table while she makes good her escape. No matter how derivative this suspenseful, high-octane, white-knuckled epic is, \\"Transporter 3\\" director Olivier Megaton compensates with picturesque staging, a cast with provocative faces, and atmospheric locales.<br /><br />Initially, \\"Colombiana\\" opens in Bogot&aacute;, Columbia, 1992. Ten-year old Cataleya Restrepo (newcomer Amanda Stenberg) watches as the henchmen of crime lord Don Luis (Beto Benities) murder her mother and father after her father tries to leave the organization. Luis' right-hand man, Marco (Jordi Molla of \\"Blow\\"), tries to capture Cataleya because she has in her possession a microchip filled with incriminating evidence that her father had given her as insurance. He tells her that the microchip is her passport to America. Cataleya enters the United States, strikes a deal with the U.S. authorities, and hands them all the information on the Luis' gang. She escapes from the U.S. authorities and catches a bus to Chicago, Illinois, to live with her Uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis of \\"Training Day\\") in Chicago.<br /><br />A criminal himself, Emilio lets the young girl sleep in his late son's room and trains her to as a contract assassin. In one great scene, Emilio explains that even contract assassins--if they plan to survive more than five years--must attend public school and display some modicum of intelligence. Besson and co-scripter Robert Mark Kamen fast-forward the plot 15 years ahead, and Cataleya has become a svelte killing machine who has discovered Don Luis has been taken into protective custody by the CIA. Nevertheless, the Central Intelligence Agency allows Luis to continue his business as usual. Neither the CIA nor the FBI, however, can thwart Cataleya when she goes into action against them, knocking off one individual at a time until she confronts Marco. After she kills a victim, our heroine draws a Cataleya flower on him to remind Don Luis that he is her prime target. When Cataleya isn't dodging Don Luis' gunmen, she must keep a step ahead of a tenacious FBI agent, Ross (Lennie James of \\"The Next Three Days\\") who believes that a man is responsible for the murder rampage. Cataleya lets her romantic relationship with an artist, Danny (Michael Vartan of \\"Alias\\"), interfere with her plans. Danny has no clue about her line of work, until he exposes her quite by accident to the villains. The scene where the FBI and a SWAT team surround Cataleya's safe house generates considerable tension.<br /><br />\\"Colombiana\\" qualifies as an outlandish, audacious exercise in suspense and tension that benefits from Zoe Saldana's performance and helmer Olivier Megaton's slam-bang action scenes.lla of \\"Blow\\"), tries to capture Cataleya because she has in her possession a microchip filled with incriminating evidence that her father had given her as insurance.

B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book really was a great book. it was basically about a dystopian society where one girl finally realizes enough to break free. I think Lena was a good choice for the main character. A few other people have said that Hana was better and that she shouldve been the protagonist, but I disagree. The fact that Lena does realize enough to overcome her oppression allows her character to evolve whereas Hana pretty much stays the same. She is a fitting sidekick, but not sufficient to b the main character.   I do agree with the fact that the story does move a little slowly though. It takes a long time for Lena to see the faults of her society, and is drawn out again until the ending.   In my personal opinion though i thought the book was great! Oliver does a great job showing Lenas dependence on the world and a great job evolving her from that point. She is like a master with the emotional endings! I loved the ending in before i fall, which i recommend to read, and this one was just as good!  This was a great read and i cant wait for the next book to come out!
0872860175|5.0|Ginsberg is both tragic and dynamic, a lyrical genius, con man extraordinaire, and probably the single greatest influence on American poetical voice since Whitman. So said Dylan Thomas, another lyrical genius whose works like Ginsbergs are also best read aloud. Preferably through a megaphone. The opening sequence of Howl not only burns itself into the brain but marks an American era in which poetry was not a useless profession but rather a game changer in culture and politics:  \\"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by   madness, starving hysterical naked,   dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn   looking for an angry fix,   angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly   connection to the starry dynamo in the machin-   ery of night,   who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat   up smoking in the supernatural darkness of   cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities   contemplating jazz,   who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and   saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tene-   ment roofs illuminated,   who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes   hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy   among the scholars of war,   who were expelled from the academies for crazy &   publishing obscene odes on the windows of the   skull,   who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burn-   ing their money in wastebaskets and listening   to the Terror through the wall...\\"   Howl makes a good Beat set with On the Road by Kerouac and Naked Lunch by William Burroughs.

0763631205|5.0|In Charles Dickens' classic masterpiece, the miserable Scrooge is given a chance to repent of his selfish lifestyle when he is visited by four spirits -- first, his tormented former business partner, sentenced to wander the netherworld until he has atoned for his sins -- and then three \\"Spirits of Christmas,\\" who show him the past origins of his lifestyle, the present effects of his selfishness on people in his life, and the future toward which his life is tending.  He wakes from the final vision a changed man, renounces his selfish ways, and lives a generous, loving life from that time forward.<br /><br />This hope-filled moral tale contains themes of redemption, hope, and generosity that resonate with Christianity, but it isn't really a Christian story.  In fact, it is a good example of how a Christian holiday has come to be observed in a way that diffuses its religious meaning.<br /><br />For Christians, Christmas is a day to celebrate God's gift of his Son to humanity.  The familiar phrase \\"Peace on earth, goodwill to men\\" was first spoken by angels announcing Jesus' birth (Luke 2:13-14).  This peace primarily refers to the relationship between God and humanity (Romans 5:1-2).  God miraculously extended Himself to us in the body of Jesus, ending the hostility that had separated us from Him since Adam's rebellion (Romans 5:15-17).  As Christians rejoice in the miracle of Christ's reconciliation, God's love naturally pours out into joyful generosity toward other people.<br /><br />This significance of the holiday has been largely forgotten in our post-Christian society, but you can still feel the shadow of that joy in a general sentiment of humanitarian goodwill recognized as \\"Christmas spirit.\\"  In Dickens' story, the Spirit of Christmas is personified in the three figures of past, present and future Christmases, and it is to Christmas Spirit, not to God, that Scrooge turns in his repentance.  In his own words:<br /><br />  \\"Spirit!\\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe.  \\"Hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse..... I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year.  I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future.  The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me.  I will not shut out the lessons that they teach.\\"<br /><br />For Christians, who believe the only way to change your life is to trust in Jesus, Scrooge's repentance will be somewhat unconvincing -- but that doesn't mean thoughtful Christians can't appreciate the author's brilliant portrayal of human sin, selfishness, and suffering.  This is a moral tale, excellent for demonstrating the consequences of sin and the benefits of goodness.  Unlike many moral tales, this one is infused with joyful hope, executed with a literary excellence that has endeared it to readers for over 150 years.<br /><br />Dickensian language can be difficult for children to follow, and the content of this story may be troubling to an elementary audience, but for parents who think their kids will enjoy this story, an illustrated version can go a long way toward bridging the language gap.  My favorite edition is illustrated by P.J. Lynch, whose exemplary gift for depicting human emotion makes his characters very real.  They almost seem to breathe on the page, and the reader is effortlessly drawn into their thoughts and interests.was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse.....

0670022705|5.0|I first saw this book and its author, Neil MacGregor, featured on The Colbert Report, and my inner museum-happy kid went nuts. I had to get ahold of a copy. The writing is a joy to read and it evokes a beautiful mental picture of the objects being described, more than one could understand from a glance at a photograph (though there are plenty of those). I love how carefully the author selected the objects that he felt could best tell human history from 2 million years ago to today. He includes some of the more flashy, historical objects of grandeur we are used to, such as statues and sarcophagi, but frequently reaches for the objects that give a much different (and no less important) view of society, such as pestles, sandle labels, and credit cards.   It is an imaginative history book - in the introduction, the author explains how so many of these objects were taken from societies that had no written records, and who have long been forgotten, so in many cases, we can only imagine and hypothesize the full significance of the objects. And, he does this beautifully; it is a difficult line to walk because it can be easy to confuse fact with our own colored perceptions. He consults experts and descendants of these cultures where he can, and often makes conjectures of his own, but admits the holes in our knowledge. I appreciate this in a book; he allows the freedom to make theories, but reminds us of what we know, and more importantly, don't know.  I'd recommend this read to anyone who wants to gain a deep appreciation of where we, as humans, came from, what signifies our humanity, and perhaps where we are headed.
0670022411|4.0|A Discovery of Witches is really a fascinating and strange book. Set in a world, where, unbeknownst to humans, there are three separate supernatural races wandering about, all extremely careful of the others, all on the cusp of immense change. Witches, male or female spell casters, Vampires the scholars and scientists, and daemons, who are all artistic and erratic creativity. Though all races are aware of each other their relationships tend to be uneasy. The one thing they are united in is not letting the humans find out about them.   Dr. Diana Bishop comes from a long line of very famous and powerful witches- but she has spent most of her life trying to forget her powers and never, ever use them. Her main interest in life is her scholarship of alchemy and she has just started a term at Oxford College, where something very simple happens that starts off a most complicated conflict.   While researching, Diana calls up an ancient manuscript in Oxford's library- an enchanted manuscript that all other races have been trying to gain access to for many years. Her unknown success gains her the attention of many other witches and deamons- along with several vampires, one of whom is Mathew Clairmont.   Clairmont is a scientists and a very old vampire. While searching for answers about the manuscript he and Diana form a connection. And when her safety is called into question the only way he knows to protect her is to educate her about her heritage and that of the manuscript.  As the two head off on their journey of discovery the magical races prepare to square off- all believing the fate of their people lies in the enchanted pages only Diana has been able to see.  What the future holds is uncertain for her and her new friend but it's becoming increasingly clear her destiny is entwined hopelessly with Mathew and the future of the magical races...  This is the first in a trilogy. A long, complicated trilogy that I am thrilled appears not to be to highly edited because, trust me, you need all the detail you can get with this book.  This book not only packs a lot of emotion and historic detail but also a great deal about the three races and their place in the world.  A wonderful mix of historical novel, fantasy novel and romance novel this was really fun to read. I look forward to the second book in the trilogy, \\"Shadow of Night.\\"  Four stars.
B005529BDK|5.0|This game is very addictive, I have had this for months and still love it. I am constantly trying to out do my previous best scores.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I bought this case for my wife's Kindle Fire, and she loved it.<br />The feeling of the product is real good, solid and very well made
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am so happy I read this book because I really enjoyed it. I had resisted it because I don't read books in series. Technically, this is a trilogy, but still ...  (Yes, I will be reading the next two books as well.)<br /><br />This actually is considered \\"young adult fiction\\" but I really enjoyed it because it's in one of my favorite genres: post-apocalyptic, non-zombie/non-vampire fiction. In addition to having a mesmerizing, action-filled story line, the book is written in a style that makes for a fast, easy read. The plot is such that I found myself thinking, more than once, \\"wow, this could actually happen.\\" Of course hopefully it never will, because we would truly be living a horrifying existence if these events ever came to be.<br /><br />I loved the main character in the book, and appreciated the voice the author gave her, which drew me into her mind and her world, and had me rooting for her from the beginning. It was pretty easy to figure out where the story was going to end up, but the fun of the book was in getting there.<br /><br />Now, on to book #2 ...
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Before buying this product I read many reviews. Most reviews that are positive say that this product did exactly what it claims it does, which is, it converts a keyboard and a mouse into a controller. Basically, Eagle Eye allows keyboard and mouse use on a ps3. Most negative reviews say that the set up was hard, and that the mouse or keyboard were not useable with the device. In my experience the everything works. I use a microsoft mouse, and a basic logitech mouse, they both worked. For the keybaord I use a rather complicated wireless keybaord by logitech as well. The keyboard works too. So as far as compatibility, I had a great experience, in fact the eagle eye is able to process the wireless keyboard, which is something even the eagle eye manufacturer says it should not be able to do. As far as the set up, its pretty easy, with a laptop even easier, because with the laptop on and close to the ps3 I was able to set up my controls while looking at the controls in game. In any rate, this thing does what it says it will do. I can't play fps with controllers, and this device allows me to enjoy my PS3 fully.
B00150XK2Y|5.0|A bargain, but this set is currently available as a download from Amazon.uk for only £2.99 [less than $5].<br />Here is what I wrote on the Amazon.uk site:<br /><br />\\"I have loved these works for over 40 years. I started with Casals and Tortellier on LP, and on CD I have two versions by Janos Starker [Philips and RCA], and Steven Isserlis on Hyperion. On seeing that this highly recommended recording was available as a download for only £2.99, how could I resist?<br />My initial response is very favourable, and while it will not displace my affections for some of the older versions, I already much prefer it to the Isserlis [Added: which a BBC 'Record Review' nominated as the top version about three years ago.]<br />What are the chief merits of this set?<br />Well, we are left in no doubt that this is music from the early eighteenth century, or that it is essentially dance music. Mork plays with a proper sense of period, and he achieves a lightness and bouyancy, with no sense of strain whatever. Indeed, he even manages to make the music sound easy and effortless - which, of course it is not. He does not linger over juicy detail and is never lugubrious; but on the other hand nothing here sounds perfunctory. Indeed, he makes me want to dance. These airborn performances manage to achieve the seemingly impossible, being at the same time both historically informed and utterly contemporary. I can see this set becoming a firm favourite.\\"
0439023521|4.0|I will be the first to admit that I am hard on books, especially when they have high ratings and the main topic of conversation amongst my friends is how much I will love it. For the first hundred and fifty pages I was bored senseless and even put the book down a couple of times only to hear my daughter go on and on about how much she loved it.<br /><br />Ok, except for mushy-gushy girl books, we usually agree so once again I picked up the book and plodded on.<br /><br />Well heck, this book got good very quickly. Once the Hunger Games themselves started, the storyline and the characters mesmerized me to the point that I finished the last 200 pages in one sitting.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen has not had it any harder than the others children from her area, but when her younger sister is called during the reaping, she know that she must step in and take her place. She does not think that she can win the games, but she knows for sure that she does not want her sister to die. With Peeta, a boy from her area, they take on the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Katniss has to keep reminding herself that there can only be one winner in these games. Games that take place in an area that was once known as North American and is now split up in districts that send young teens to a battle ground to fight to the death to bring honor back to their people and their district. All the while being broadcast in full gory detail back to the audience that is betting on who will win.<br /><br />\\"He is luring you in to make you easy prey. The more likable he is the more deadly he is.\\"<br /><br />The rules of the game state that there can only be one winner. From the first salvos to the last cannon shot, the combatants must form allies and know that at the end all but one of them will die. That is until there is a game changing moment and you wonder if the rules of the heart and the rules of the game can coincide.<br /><br />This is only the first in a trilogy and I hope that they next book can keep up the lightning pace and note that this one ended on.ded on.

B0034G4P9E|5.0|I dont review much but felt compelled after watching the blu ray last night, not too many movies move you on so many levels in two hours like this one did, some may point out its flaws but the story and the acting and the suspense overcome these easily.  One of the greatest films I have ever seen.
B0000042MY|4.0|This album is a brilliant masterpiece. I would recommend especially to anyone who enjoys celtic music or folksy sounding music.
B002WY65VU|4.0|I could hate this film for wasting it's \\"big\\" budget on things that don't make zombie movies great, but how can anyone expect smart investors to finance a project that isn't likely to earn them the biggest return possible?  So, \\"Zombieland\\" is a crowd pleasing, mainstream zombie movie. Maybe the most successful yet, and mostly because it is entertaining - and isn't that what everyone wants from a movie, even a zombie movie?  It's clever, funny, fast paced, has likable characters, talented performances, excellent visuals and all the rest that makes fun movies fun. Unfortunately, the zombies only \\"bookend the movie and it's neither gory or scary. Not my favorite zombie movie (Romero's \\"Day of the Dead,\\" the 2004 Dawn of the Dead\\"  & \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" are among my favorites), but it's still fun. I just hope \\"Hollywood\\" doesn't destroy cult zombie films, 'cause horror that transcends a tiny budget is what great horror is all about. Check out \\"Colin,\\" to see what talent and ingenuity can do with less money than was spent on coffee, while making \\"Zombieland.\\"
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This case is very light, yet it feels very strong. I feel that my kindle will be perfectly fine if I accidentally drop it with this case. The only problem I've seen is from my choice of color, white. I have used this for a little more than a month, using it often at school, home, etc. But I have noticed that dirt shows up very badly on the rubberized side. It bothers me so much that I've considered getting a black one to replace it. But other than that it's a great case.
B0057MFA42|1.0|This Blue ray is horrible. I downloaded the latest update from my ps3 and still the same issue. I was very fortunate to take it back to best buy. They gave me the same one but it was unopened. So the next day I took it back unopened. They told me since its not opened that I can exchange it for something else. I ended up getting AC/DC Let There Be Rock. Until they reissue this blue ray, then I will be most happy to purchase it. The Manufacturer of this Nirvana blue ray release should be ashamed. We pay good money, so give us good product!
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Upgraded from a Q6600 to this one and what a HUGE difference! It's planted in a GA-990FXA-UD3 with some Corsair Vengeance RAM and it is a great system! No complaints at all! The Black edition allows for some nice OC too!

B002G1YPH0|4.0|Provides much better than stock cooling and at a great price. You do have to remove the motherboard to install the back plate but with a new build or upgrade you're going to anyway. The instructions are a little weak but you can figure most of it out. The retention bracket does allow for some movement even when tightened down all the way but after installation it still dropped my idle temps from 29c to 26c and 100% load temps from 46c to 39c. I did install the push/pull system since I had an extra fan. You get enough thermal paste for 2 installation attempts but the included paste is really thin. It will do nicely for a small OC!<br /><br />Overall pretty nice piece but it is also VERY LARGE. Get exact measurements before purchase or you will be sorry!
1451627289|4.0|Thank you Stephen King for returning (finally) to form and captivating me once again.  I have been a life-long King fan ever since I read Cujo at 15. But to say I have been disappointed in the last few years is an understatement.  My favorite books in the world have been written by King (The Talisman being my all-time favorite- though really, what did Straub contribute?) but ever since Insomnia I have been having a hard time getting into his books, the one exception being The Green Mile (phenomenal book- or series... depending).  Every now and again I find myself trying yet again to renew my love affair with his writing, but time and time again I have been disappointed. The dual books, The Regulators/Desperation were such a travesty and don't get me started on Dreamcatcher. GAH!  The last couple of times I've tried recently were Cell and Under the Dome and both times I wondered why I wasted my time reading them.  There were times I just wondered if my tastes had simply changed, but I still love his early books from Carrie all the way to Dolores Claiborne. Each of his stories was less about the Horror aspect and more about the human aspect, something I loved about his writing; I experienced his books, I didn't read them.  For me there is nothing quite like \\"falling into the hole in the page\\" when I am reading and losing myself for hours at a time.  King was always so adept with showing you not telling you how things happened when writing his books. Something a lot of current writers lack. I could never understand the appeal of Clive Barker since he was more of a teller, (\\"then the thing bit off his head\\"- type of writing). I tried and tried to get into Peter Straub thanks to The Talisman and why he has been compared to King beyond that collaboration is beyond me. The man cannot stay within a voice to save his life. Every one of his books has him digressing from storyteller to storyteller and voice to voice to the point that, half the time, I have no clue what time orwhat character it is.  I looked to Stephen King to entertain me and keep my faith in the joys of reading and until Insomnia he was so adept at that. And now he's back to form.  I am so glad that I took the chance to read 11/22/63. Since The Green Mile I have not been as captivated by any of his works as I have with this one.  Some people have complained about a slow part in the middle section with Sadie, but I love it. It gives so much depth and so much more meaning and drive for what Jake/George feels he HAS to do. And like King was so great at doing before, throwing obstacles into his character's paths, he has achieved that greatness again. I never felt that any of the obstacles was overly contrived- outside of the scope of the setting and the fact that in this book the \\"past is obdurate\\", and found myself turning the pages as quickly as possible (okay, thumbing the \\"next\\" button on my Kindle) to see what happened next.  The ending could be somewhat obvious and some might say clichéd, but I enjoyed it and I didn't feel cheated in any way. I never once felt that I needed to pull an Annie Wilkes and abduct the man and make him rewrite the tale because of any imagined slights towards me as his \\"constant reader\\" (though I might have wanted to do that with Dreamcatcher- the farting... really Uncle Stevie, that was ALL necessary? *eyeroll)  So if you are a King fan and have been following since day one or, if like me, you fell away and felt he had peaked, try this story and I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Dropped right in and was ready to go. The only real complaint I have is the very poor location of the SATA headers. Once installed, they were hard to get to since they point to the side of the case rather than straigt up like most do. Overall it's a great board. I dropped in a 1090T Black with some Corsair Vengeance RAM and it's a great system. BIOS allows for great OC.
B005HEQIGO|4.0|For anyone considering passing on the video because of the other reviews, it should be made clear that while the audio is indeed bad it is not so bad that you can't watch the episode. There is a sort of warbling distortion, but it only has a noticeable effect on some of the music (particularly the high trumpet parts in the opening and closing theme). Dialogue is unaffected and after the main theme I mostly stopped noticing the problem.

1851687793|2.0|It turns out this book is th same as \\"How to teach Physcis to your dog\\" with just Quantum added to the title.  Doesn't say this on the print history page of the book, which is a bit naughty. There are plenty of reviews for the book under the old title. Had I known that I would not have bought this book and here's why.  I wanted to see how true the descriptions of quantum physics in the 'new age' consciousness books are and so bought three  proper books on Quantum physics.  I actually found the use of of the dog chasing rabbits images more confusing than helpful, the one thing I did get from this book which was not clear from the other books was the point that (so far at least) physicists have shown that the quantum physics effects work only on very small things and not on our scale.  I found Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed by Jim Al-Khalili much better for explanations.  What I object about the book, and why it has two stars is the last chapter, which is a virulent attack on the new age linking quantum physics to consciousness. He paints the figure of new age types as squirrels with false looking beards (does this remind you of Nazi propaganda posters - it did me) and at the end he sets his dog on the squirrels.   In  between he has selected weak targets to attack, in particular Deepak Copra. As a reviewer of the original book pointed out there is no review of the serious research in this fields (Dean Radin, William Tiller)  Now I am open to the people believing that consciousness is linked to quantum mechanics is unproven or wrong, which is why I bought this book. However I want a reasoned argument with facts not a virulent attack.

1609611543|5.0|Its great to see that \\"Wheat Belly\\" has been on the NY Times Best Seller list. That means Dr. Davis' concept of healing by elimination of wheat from the diet is catching on fast.  I believe the scientific evidence is now definitively tilted in favor of completely eliminating wheat products (and most other grains) from the diets of the overwhelming majority. Dr. Davis goes into great detail about the science behind why wheat makes us overweight and unhealthy, and makes a very strong case why we are seeing such an epidemic of people who are overweight or obese, prediabetic or diabetic, many with heart problems. Not to mention possible links to all sorts of nasty auto-immune diseases.  Without going through the many titles, over the past few decades there have been quite a few books with similarities to Dr. Davis' tour-de-force \\"Wheat Belly.\\" I think many of us have had a good idea of what we should do.  But, Dammit - its hard! Its hard in every day life to make the necessary changes and stick to them. About 10 years back I lost significant weight trying to stay \\"in the Zone.\\"  But... there's all that great pizza around here especially the local tomato pies, the awesome subs from another local place and the most delicious bagels ever, from another local place etc...it just became too big of a hassle to stick with the program. Five years ago my wife, who had been suffering for years with bad \\"GI issues\\" found out she was celiac - no more wheat or glutens for her. Now Dr. Davis' book came along and finally put it all into such a clear perspective for me, that this time it really is different.  After hurting my back earlier this year I decided to take my doctor's advice and try to lose some pounds starting around 225. Just a few weeks before I heard of \\"Wheat Belly\\", I began to cut out the high glycemic carbs as much as possible. By the time I started reading the book I was down to 215. By almost completely cutting out the wheat and most other grains, the pounds just melted off. I'm now hovering around 198, shooting for 185.  And I'm really looking forward to new bloodwork and seeing my doctor in a few weeks.   Dr. Davis has not written just another \\"diet book.\\" This goes well beyond merely losing some pounds. For many people there seems to be a host of other benefits. In my case I feel much more alert or \\"with it\\" as opposed to fighting the mental fog throughout the day. While my back is still a little iffy, it feels way better than 6 months ago with less stress from the extra weight. Other aches and pains (hands, wrist, knees or ankles) have all but disappeared. My sleep is much sounder than previously. The strange headaches I was getting last summer are gone. In short, I feel as good as I ever have. Will you? Give it a shot!
0553386794|1.0|I wasted a day reading this book and I hope my review saves someone else from wasting their time on this book.  I've read most of the fantasy writers from Tolkien to Norton and am a huge fan of this genre.  But Martin's book left me feeling like his unfleshed out characters...  flat and with an unpleasant taste in my mouth.  Here are the reasons why I didn't like this book.<br /><br />1.  The way Martin writes about sex and women is reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs... in other words... degrading.<br /><br />2.  Martin spends so much time unfolding his plot and introducing his many, many characters that he neglects to flesh out the personality of his characters.  Most of the characters were flat.  I had trouble understanding or caring about their motivations.  The dwarf was the most well fleshed out and complex character and therefore the most interesting.  Martin also casually kills many of his characters off.  Usually this would be distressing but many of Martin's people were so flat that I found that I just didn't care what happened to them.<br /><br />3. The only females that Martin gave a backbone to were the Stark mother and her youngest daughter.  The rest were weak minded and annoyingly stupid.<br /><br />4.  The story line is incredibly complex.  If you plan on reading the entire series you'd have to do it all at once.  I know I won't have time to sit down and read another book for the next three months.  I will have forgotten the majority of the plot by then.<br /><br />5.  A lot of the story lines were annoyingly illogical... a bunch of rangers wearing black who guard a massive wall for example.  They have trouble getting recruits because they have to swear a vow to never leave the wall and to never have a family.  If they break this vow they get their heads chopped off.  But according to the author of this story, there used to be LOTS of these rangers.  The only motivation in this story for a person to become a ranger is to get out of jail.  Another flawed plot line is winter that lasts for years.  How do these people survive if winter lasts for years?<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this book.  It is annoying and it fills your mind with unpleasant images.  There are enough unpleasant images in this world that are real.  Why bother reading about make-believe unpleasantness?How do these people survive if winter lasts for years?    Don't waste your time on this book.  It is annoying and it fills your mind with unpleasant images.  There are enough unpleasant images in this world that are real.  Why bother reading about make-believe unpleasantness?
B005KJZDXK|1.0|I really did want to love this album. Some of my friends like it, and it sounded like a cute project with great classic songs. Unfortunately, my response upon finally hearing the album was not joy but horror. What kind of a sicko greedy executive allowed Zooey Deschanel to release this album in the hope of making a few bucks off her fame? I felt secondary embarrassment for them, this album is so terrible.   Zooey Deschanel's vocal range is minimal and varies from 'spoken-word-passed-off-as-singing' to 'out-of-tune-beagle-in-heat'. The auto-tuned parts are unashamedly passed off as quirky-indy variations on the original melody/sound, and the non-auto-tuned parts made me wish they HAD been auto-tuned. In short, Zooey Deschanel, as wonderful as she normally is, has absolutely no feel for phrasing, can't sing in tune, and has no range. Please stop trying to pass off bad singing as 'indy'.   The whole album was so painful and embarrassing to listen to that I had no choice but to turn it off after making myself listen to four or five songs. It just gets worse and worse the longer you listen to it... stick to what you're best at Zooey, acting!
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|You'll notice from my ID of \\"A's Fan\\" that I might be a bit biased about this movie, but I was prepared to be disappointed in the results.  I wasn't.  It was great in its understated script and execution.  Having been an A's season ticket holder for these very years, it was interesting to see how this maps onto \\"reality\\".  It seems pretty close -- as far as movies go -- although I feel that the A's manager, Art Howe, was needlessly thrown under the bus.  I'm not sure why they made him seem like such a malcontent.  My youngest son and I were extras in the crowd for one night of the filming in Oakland -- the final game 20. It was interesting to see, from row 2, how a whole night's worth of shooting turn into about 6-8 seconds of the final film.  Although we've seen the movie twice in the theaters, we'll have to wait for the blu-ray version to see if our faces are in the film at all.  It flashes by pretty quickly.  Worth seeing even if you're not a die hard baseball fan.  We loved the movie.  You may \\"only\\" really, really like it.
0061914177|4.0|I was intrigued by the title of this book, and once I started reading it I was immediately sucked in. Gary has a very matter-of-fact and non-traditional writing style, and I enjoyed reading his own personal stories sprinkled throughout the lessons in this book. He shows how ANYONE can become a celebrity online, becoming an expert at and talking about what you are passionate about. With the principles in this book, I plan to make some changes with my own personal brand in the weeks and months to follow. Thanks Gary!<br /><br />More on my thoughts on this book and a review on my blog:[...]
0307949508|2.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />The first novel of the series annoyed me for one reason. It was painfully obvious from halfway through the book who the murderer would be. But I still decided to read the 2nd book of the series, because overall the first was entertaining, even if I knew who the offender would be.<br /><br />And I won't lie, this book moved much more quickly than the first. It really kept me turning pages, but ultimately I feel very let down. Lets be serious... a perfectly strong and otherwise unharmed person would have a hard time digging themselves out of a grave. But a person who suffered 3 gunshot wounds, one of which is to the head exposing brain, having extensive blood loss, and only able to use one hand with half of their upper body paralyzed, being able to do it? And then going on to incapacitate someone with an ax after? And one of the big bad villains thinking he sees a monster and running away so that she's saved? The ending was WAY too much for me. It completely ruined it all.<br /><br />If you're looking for a superhuman hero story, this is alright. Salander is an intriguing character. He is very good at uncovering layers and drawing you in over and over. But for me, he blew it with this ending. If you get in to books because the author tells even a remotely plausible story, this is not it.<br /><br />I really doubt I'll be reading the third.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Everything that I wrote about \\"The Game of Thrones\\" is true for this continuing storyline as well. I will include the same review as for the first novel.  I have read plenty of average fantasy in my life, so I wasn't looking forward to diving into any more eight hundred page novels that might be of a similar caliber. Strike two is that I don't generally love much of anything that's set in a medieval time period... so my expectations were low until I started reading reviews everywhere. Still hesitant at that point, I purchased this novel and was blown away.  Martin is unbelievable in  that he is willing to do so many things with his characters that you wouldn't expect (or want him to do), but in the long run, making big moves like these are what really create the epic moments that you won't forget anytime soon.  The other major plus is that he the best in the genre at creating so many moments of tension. You just can't wait to find out where this next plot twist is going to take you... and then he moves you on to another protagonist's/antagonist's point of view. Once this story gets moving, I was constantly on the edge of losing my mind! It's nearly impossible not to skip ahead in the book to the next portion of that character's story.  Overall, Martin has created a remarkably engrossing  storyline with a  broad cast of well-developed characters that would rival almost any work of fiction that I've read.  He does pretty much everything right in this novel, however, the only reasons I don't give it a five star rating are:   1. My lack of enthusiasm of this time period in general; he does it very well, but it's still not my favorite thus bringing my enjoyment level down a notch or two  2. I didn't really learn anything from the novel. It's very fun to read, but one of the things about reading fiction, nonfiction, etc is that I love to learn from the writer. Many of my favorite authors of fiction know how to weave lots of incredible depth and emotional development intotheir characters that we can apply to our situations (or to other people that we've interacted with).   Don't get me wrong, this is incredible writing, and I am highly recommending it to anyone that loves to read.... and if you've never read fantasy before, focus your energy here.  *****___(Perfection)  The highest degree of enjoyment / fulfillment I've personally experienced with reading  ****½___(Excellent)  Only lower than five stars due to falling short on any number of \\"subjective\\" categories  ****____(Influential)  A very satisfying experience and has me looking for more from this writer/genre   ***½____(Good)  Keeps me engaged but unlikely to look for more by this writer unless highly recommended   ***_____(Average)  Could take it or leave it and will not be looking for more by the same writer   **______(Poor)  Constantly asking myself, \\"How much worse can this get?\\" every few minutes  *_______(Terrible)  Belongs in the dumpster...

B000003NA4|4.0|this is a wonderful album. Twelve songs, about 53 minutes run time, five well-known standards given fresh and unusual arrangements. You might think \\"You're Getting to Be a Habit With Me\\" is rushed, while your friend may feel it is perfect. You could decide that six-plus minutes of \\"I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance\\" is two minutes past its prime, while your partner is content with Diana's superb piano playing and distinctive vocal. This is a trio effort, and Russell Malone on guitar and Christian McBride on bass make excellent contributions. As a whole, it just is a major triumph, in my ears and view.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|This is a really well-written book in the same vein as  works by Jonathan Franzen and other authors that I really enjoy, so I was pretty excited to see how well received this book was by the public and critics alike. The book is written about several main characters over multiple time periods, and it really focused on how and why their lives evolved in the ways that they did.<br /><br />What I loved about this book is that doesn't always follow a linear progression of one or two characters and throw in a few flashback scenes before moving on.  Instead, we are introduced to one of the main characters, and then another... and then we are seeing things through the eyes of all of the characters they were interacting with - years earlier or years later than where we started. While this has undoubtedly been done before, Jennifer Egan does it well with some very exceptional dialogue that really keeps you hooked on everything that's developing. It's really wild to read about a few bit players in a particular scene, only to have them as the narrator in the next scene.<br /><br />However, this also has the downside of not necessarily developing the characters to their fullest potential, thus giving you characters that you genuinely \\"get to know\\" and end up really caring about as much as in certain other novels.  I also didn't enjoy the last sections of the book all that much compared to the first ninety percent, but these aren't deal breaker issues for me.  This will definitely be a book that I pick up again sometime in the future, and I'm looking forward to what I'll dig out the next time I go through it.<br />*****___(Perfection)  The highest degree of enjoyment / fulfillment I've personally experienced with reading<br />****½___(Excellent)  Only lower than five stars due to falling short on any number of \\"subjective\\" categories<br />****____(Influential)  A very satisfying experience and has me looking for more from this writer/genre<br />***½____(Good)  Keeps me engaged but unlikely to look for more by this writer unless highly recommended<br />***_____(Average)  Could take it or leave it and will not be looking for more by the same writer<br />**______(Poor)  Constantly asking myself, \\"How much worse can this get?\\" every few minutes<br />*_______(Terrible)  Belongs in the dumpster...

It's the most fun book I've ever read.\\"  Me: \\"Sounds insane; I guess I'll take a look!\\"  I heard this kind of praise from a lot of people, so eventually, I caved in to all of the hype surrounding this first book in the series. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but if I was a teenager, this would probably be the greatest thing that I had ever seen.  But given that I've had a lot more experience with reading, it's really just another fun, above-average mindless read.   While there are a number of sections that are very irritating to me due to poor dialogue and boring description, I found that there were enough \\"fun/I can't stop reading\\" sections that I am compelled to give the book a 3 1/2 instead of a 3.

B004FOA84A|5.0|this game is probably one of the best games on android! if you like puzzle and finding games this game is for you! 5 out of 5
B0044XV3QY|2.0|====================<br /> 1. NOT Wide Screen<br />====================<br /><br />Although Amazon's listing for this item clearly states that it is \\"Widescreen\\", it is absolutely NOT!  Note the last word in the following descripton line.<br /><br />  \\"Format: Blu-ray, Special Extended Version, Color, ...<br />  ... Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, Subtitled, Surround Sound, Widescreen\\"<br /><br />Several lines further down in the description is the proof that it is NOT widescreen.  Note the \\"1.78\\" aspect ratio shown in the snippet below.<br /><br />  \\"Aspect Ratio: 1.78:1\\"<br /><br />... What it really is! ...<br /><br />This item is actually a cropped/panned version edited to fit on a 16:9 HD screen. That eliminates the sweeping panoramas this movie is famous for.  I can see no excuse for such an error.  Anyone close to the movie distribution business knows these basic things.  It seems more likely the distributor wanted to dump excess inventory with an erroneous description.  The only thing \\"wide\\" about it is that, being High-Def 16:9 Digital TV, it is \\"wider\\" than old Standard-Def 4:3 NTSC Analog TV. That's not saying much.<br /><br />... How different is it really? ...<br /><br />Like most modern widescreen epics, this movie's original theatrical aspect ratio is around 2.40:1. That is quite a bit wider than the 1.85:1 (17:9) ratio used on mainstream movies and MUCH wider than the 1.78 (16:9) ratio of this version which was cropped/panned to fill an HD TV screen without letterboxing.<br /><br />So, what's with all the \\"?:9\\" ratios?  Since the exact aspect ratio of HD was chosen to be 1.78:1 (for both technical and industry reasons), 16:9 (16-ninths) turns out to be the closest whole number fraction that equals that decimal ratio.  Now that consumers have become familiar with HD TV's 16:9 aspect ratio, it is less confusing to convert other decimal ratios into the closest 9th's fraction so they can mentally compare them to the 16:9 of HD rather then use yet another odd whole number fraction that more closely fits the exact decimal ratio.<br /><br />... Conclusion ...<br /><br />This was a HUGE disappointment.  Making matters worse it that Amazon doesn't even carry the Widescreen version even though smaller ecommerce behemoths like KMart, Sears, Walmart, and Target all do.  The difference to look for is the proper version's listed title actually has \\"WIDESCREEN\\" in it and, most importantly, the product detail lists the aspect ratio closer to \\"2.40\\".  Go to Walmart.com and search for \\"Avatar Widescreen\\" and you'll see the correct product listed there.<br /><br />If you are not that serious about cinema, hate letterboxing, don't mind cutting out parts of the image, and just want your media to fill your HD screen without bars or distortion, then this item may be OK for you.  However, if you do care for such things then you will feel totally ripped off. Stay away.<br /><br />If I get my hands on the true widescreen (uncropped) version, I'll review it then.<br /><br />================<br /> 2. Delay Issue<br />================<br /><br />Despite the atrocious cropping, we did try to do a quick review of the movie's features but we had SEVERE play issues when inserted into our new Samsung BD-D6700 Blu-Ray player which we bought so we could so we could also do some streaming.  On the very first insertion after the player was installed, it took a whopping 4 Minutes just to get to the opening movie scene.  We initially got a black screen for 1.5 minuites, then the FBI WARNING for 30 seconds, then another 1 minute of waiting while we watched a small animated \\"20th Century\\" icon in the center of the screen, then another 30-60 seconds, then the opening scene.  That is an insane anmount of time that few could put up with.  After several exits and replays the time shrunk significantly but it still took over a minute to get to the opening scene.  Since this player is rated as one of the fastest, we suspect there is a an operational compatibility issue between the Samsung and this disc.<br /><br />After some additional pondering of the delay issue, we suspect it is a combination of Samsung bugs and the disc's BD-Live content.  The player may be responding to triggers in the disc to access BD-Live net content as it plays and changes chapters.  There also seems to be no way to turn off BD-Live ... at least on the Samsung.  It does have a setting to \\"prohibit\\" BD-Live network access but, when enabled, that makes things even worse because the Samsung still allows the disc to access the net then pops an error that you have to clear with an [OK] that says \\"BD-Live network access has been prohibited\\". That's the GUI equivalent of entrapment! Argh!<br /><br />[Update] Following our initial test of this Avatar disc, we tested a widescreen version of Avatar (purchased at the same time from Amzonon) on the same Samsung BD-D6700.  That disc played perfectly with the only delay being, as expected, between insertion and the 1st image.  That took roughly 30 seconds, an good time for BD discs. Subsequent replays while inserted were faster still.<br /><br />==================<br /> 3. Quality Issue?<br />==================<br /><br />Although we did not spend much time testing the image quality of this disc due to it being the wrong edition, we did notice what seemed to be an image quality problem.  The best way to describe it is to liken it to the effect you get when you watch a program that is pre-letter boxed with a matte border so it fits both SD and HD displays.  They do this when budget is an issue as is the case with the grossly underfunded PBS network.  This is where the main image is actually less than total image size, much like a matted photo or painting.  As such, the image can be forced to fit both SD and HD screens by the various settings of a TV's Aspect control such as Crop, Full, Fit, or Zoom.  They all mean different things on different TV's.  The problem is that by expanding such a program, you are enlarging a smaller image with lesser pixels to fill a larger screen with more pixels.  The result is an image that seems slightly unsharp, mushy, or fuzzy.  You cannot make 2 image pixels fill 3 screen pixels without playing geometry games that destroy sharpness.<br /><br />We suspect this loss of quality may have been a byproduct of the crop/pan process.  Although all the pixels should be there when they cropped it horizontally, we suspect that, for artistic balance, they may have also cropped vertically to better balance the final framing.  If true, that then means they would have ended up with too few pixels for a 1-to-1 mapping to an HD screen and would have had to resort to enlargement which, of course, mushes the image sharpness.  Add to those foibles, the problem of panning an image that was already panned, and the image degrades even more.  Please note, however, that these issues are unlikely to be severe enough to make them noticeable to anyone other than those who are into cinematic image quality.  E.g., some of our friends and family don't really notice or care about such things.<br /><br />====================<br /> Review Bottom Line<br />====================<br /><br />If you want a fast playing, widescreen, Blu-ray version of this movie, we suggest you look for an edition where the item's main catalog title has \\"WIDESCREEN\\" in it and, if possible, without \\"BD-Live\\".  There seems to be a growing play-delay issue with BD-Live content and some of the more advanced Blu-ray players.  The delays may have something to do with:<br /><br />(1) BD-Live content is provided over the web by the movie studios and may expire or not always be available (a growing problem with limited life \\"cloud-based\\" apps)<br /><br />(2) Complex multitasking that occurs while a disc plays and the player concurrently load BD-Live content in background to its internal cache<br /><br />We conjecture that since OEM's rightly place movie viewing as a top priority, they perform the primary BD-Live content loading prior to, or in between, the leading \\"fluff\\" chapters like trailers, FBI warning etc, studio logos, etc.  That hypothesis would completely explain our horrendous and unacceptable delays when this edition when paired with a Samsung BD-D6700 BD-Live.<br /><br />\\"The faster we go, the slower we get there\\" - TK Anthony<br />Thanks for reading.ithout playing geometry games that destroy sharpness.

B004EPYZQ2|4.0|Super 8 is a love story.  No, not a love story between the characters (sure, there's a little bit of that kissy stuff), but a love story between director J.J. Abrams and Stephen Spielberg.  It is obvious from Abrams's films that, like plenty of children who grew up in 70s and 80s, he was raised on the work of Spielberg and Lucas.  In fact, his Star Trek preboot arguably has more in common with the work of Lucas and Spielberg than with the original series.  Fashioning himself as something of a protégé, Abrams has created a wonderful little homage to his mentor.  The film opens with the off screen death of Joe Lamb's mother who worked at the local steel mill.  Both Joe and his father, Jackson, a deputy in the local police department, must deal with the emotional trauma that naturally comes from losing a loved one.  At the same time, the death also strains the relationship between Joe and Jackson.  Jackson just doesn't seem to know how to raise his son without his wife around, and he wants to ship him off to a baseball camp for the summer in the hopes that it will give him some space and stifle Joe's interest in filmmaking.  Joe has been serving as the special effects and make-up artist on his friends' movie about, what else, zombies.    The kids' zombie movie is arguably the most important aspect of Super 8.  The gang's film represents the transformation of their playacting into an art form, a transition from childhood into adulthood that still manages to bridge these two conditions.  The film further embodies the split between the world of adults and children.  In many of Spielberg's early films, especially E.T., the difference between how children and adults see the world is represented in esoteric knowledge.  The fact that the wonderful and strange actually exists can only first be perceived by an innocent youth.  But it is also by making this film that the boys come into contact with the fairer sex.  The director, Charles, has managed to get a girl, Alice, to agree to play the part of the hero's wife.  Joe happens to have an unrequited crush on Alice, and later in the film he gets to play the daring hero to her damsel in distress when Alice is in danger.  Oh, and there's also a giant space alien in the film that's trying to get off this planet while wreaking havoc on the towns folk.  The alien arrives in town by way of a derailed freight train.  The only witnesses to the train disaster are Joe and his gang who have set up next to the tracks in hopes of incorporating the train into their film so that it will lend it some verisimilitude.  The train derailment and the gang's escape is one of the finer set pieces of the film, and it is somewhat reminiscent of the plane crash in what is arguably Abrams's finest directorial effort, the pilot to the TV show Lost.  In all, the alien seems like something of an afterthought.  While Abrams does a commendable job of laying down some carefully constructed chaos, the alien himself seems somewhat perfunctory.  Unlike in E.T. (a movie that I cannot help comparing Super 8 to, even if a little unfairly), where E.T. served as a companion to a child of a single parent household who struggled to connect to other children of his own age, Super 8's monster seems like generic threat #5, seemingly picked out of a hat at random.  The alien menace and the drama of loss and adulthood never come together fully.  And while it is often enjoyable watching people escape or be eaten by the monster, I couldn't help but want to get back to the gang making their movie.    But as homage the film does plenty right.  In the 80s Spielberg placed films he produced and directed in small town suburbia, often in the Pacific Northwest.  Likewise, Abrams's Super 8 takes place in a small town in Southwest Ohio.  We can tell the movie takes place in the late seventies because the local steel mill has yet to close down.  I also grew up in a small Ohio town, and while we didn't have a steel mill (maple syrup was a large part of the local economy), the setting did make me a little wistful for small town life.  One of the great messages that come out of Spielberg's early work as a director and producer, whether it is E.T. or Goonies, is that you need not leave your town to look for adventure.  The unusual, the exciting can be uncovered in your neighbors yard, the boarded up house down the street, or the local patch of woods.  The paradoxically infinite confines of suburbia were so full of excitement that leaving that world seemed unnecessary.     And in this sense, Abrams does a fine job of mimicking Spielberg.  He may not have all of the details right, but he has done his homework, and the result is an entertaining summer blockbuster.  In a world full of sequels and prequels, we need more movies like Super 8.  Abrams may fall into the cliché of the prodigy piano player carefully reconstructing a classic; he can play the notes but he misses the soul of the music.  But then again, the music was pretty great to begin with.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|looks nice on the kindle fire but major bugs in game play. computer players cut in line, draw two apparently doesn't mean draw two, the computer players ignore it and just put down cards instead of picking up two cards. more often than not when attempting to play a card the game decides that you need to switch cards with another player, that's not uno. or another player will switch cards with you without your permission. glad I only paid 99 cents for it!  And it's been deleted!
B005F6NA56|5.0|Wow. Where do I begin? This album is just phenomenal. I've been listening to it non-stop, from the moment I got it a few weeks ago. I had never heard of Feist until I saw this album on the charts. The cover looked intriguing, so I clicked on it, and Bam! That opening riff in \\"The Bad in Each Other\\" got me right away. Unbelievably groovy, and then those pure Feist vocals coming on top; it's amazing. That very last part on the chorus gets me every time. There are so many wonderful, memorable moments, like the aching, pleading chorus in \\"Graveyard\\" to the euphoric \\"Circle Married the Line\\" and \\"Undiscovered First\\". I love every single song on here. They're all masterpieces.<br /><br />Some people complained that the album is too down-tempo and lullaby-ish, but I totally disagree. How can you sleep in rapturous intro to \\"The Bad in Each Other\\" or the riotous chants in \\"A Commotion\\"? Can you not get emotionally enveloped in the beautiful lyrics in \\"Caught a Long Wind\\" or \\"Bittersweet Melodies\\"? Don't you want to dance to the groovy \\"How Come You Never Go There\\"? If you're falling asleep to this, you're not listening. Period. .. .<br /><br />This album works magic on me. Whenever I'm upset and want something moody and engaging, I turn this on. The \\"Bad in Each Other\\"  intro does it for me, and by the time the album's done, I'm all calmed down and relaxed. I especially love the relaxing \\"Cicadas and Gulls\\". So beautiful.<br /><br />If you're hesitating getting this, don't. It's one of the best albums out right now. Don't miss it. I give it 10 stars!
6305212112|5.0|What can I say? Anyone who has seen this movie will be looking to get it. It's an amazing story about a troubled middle-aged woman who visits the nursing home and ends up finding a wonderful friend.

I work right next to where they were set up filming it, and was excited to watch the movie that was made in the city I work, plus all the drssing rooms, cars, etc was right next door, but what a terrible movie! I would not recomend the movie, period.

B00596WEVI|4.0|I bought this movie not sure exactly what to expect.  JCVD had gotten away from his body being his primary weapon to a gun being his primary weapon over the years (Until Death, Wake of Death, etc).  While JCVD is always in good shape, I think watching a 50-something kick butt on younger enemies would be hard to believe...even if he could actually do it.  It was smart of him to get more away from what made him famous to something else.  In this movie, JCVD's main weapon of choice was knives.  I would like to see JCVD evolve even more into other types of roles.  It seems that as he's moved away from the one-on-one physical contact, he's moved into more shocking, gory and bloody violence.  I thought the drill scene in Wake of Death was quite shocking when I first saw it.  There were a couple of deleted scenes in Assassination Games (they were included on the DVD) that were pretty gory.  You don't need to show the gore to get the point across.  After the making of the movie, JCVD, I hoped to see JCVD do other types of movies besides action movies.  Why can't he be in a drama with a central part of the movie being a relationship with a woman?  Why is it always action movies, with very limited female relationships incorporated?  And of late, it seems that his dialogue in his movies is cut way back.  He has an accent, so what?  I've seen his older movies like Kickboxer and Bloodsport, and he does a lot more talking in those movies than he's been allowed to do since he became a bigger star.  He was not impossible to understand in those older movies, so why can't he have a more speaking presence on screen now?  I think that JCVD could have wider appeal if he would widen the types of movies that he does.  As long as he relegates himself to just action movies, he will only appeal to the action movie fan base.  And with his age, and direct to DVD movies, he's just going to be viewed as one of those \\"used to wases,\\" with no access to a wider fan base.  I'd love to see JCVD's re-emergence into mainstream movies again.  But he needs to expand into other movie genres if he wants that to happen.  I'll know he's back when I see him on Jay Leno or David Letterman.  He may accomplish this with his appearance in the Expendables II, but that star will quickly fade.  It's just a movie FULL of \\"used to wases,\\" and it will have a very brief life as the first one did.  It will not be what shoots him back into mainstream movies for good.  It will just be a movie to reminisce about the good ol' days, and those days are long gone!  I liked Scott Adkins in this movie.  I thought the teaming-up of his character with JCVD's character was good.  It was interesting.  I would recommend this movie to any JCVD or Scott Adkins fan.  And even if you're not a fan of either of these guys, the movie is entertaining enough to hold your interest.  I thought JCVD's son, Kristofer, was a very weak character in the movie. He was not believable in the role he was playing.  He was supposed to be playing a crooked cop, and he just didn't have the screen presence for that type of heavy.  JCVD's daughter, Bianca, had a very limited speaking role in the film.  She spent her on-screen time in an unresponsive coma.  It's nice that JCVD can give his kids acting opportunities, though.    All in all, I thought the movie was a good addition to the other 35+ JCVD movies that I own.  Not at the top of the heap (TimeCop, In Hell, Until Death, Maximum Risk, Wake of Death, Nowhere to Run, Universal Soldier, etc.), but nowhere near the bottom of the heap (Hard Corps, Derailed, Street Fighter, The Order) either.  It sits comfortably in the middle in my humble opinion.
0307278255|5.0|Unaccustomed Earth is Lahiri's third book, with two collections of short stories and one novel. She seems to know the immigrant experience, the loneliness, the out-of-sync feeling with the rest of the world. Her characters try to form new bonds and try to change to fit the new world in which they are living. The title comes from a Hawthorne quote that promotes the benefits moving into new soil, both for plants and for people. These benefits are subtle in the stories presented here and only occur after an initial crisis of transplanting takes place.
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|PLEX is awesome, not perfect.  The server runs on all platforms, the client is available for tons of devices.  I have server running on my Ubuntu Linux media server.  The client runs on my iPhone, Kindle Fire, iPod, hacked Apple TV, PC, and Macbook.  Between all of these devices I can watch or listeen to almost anything.<br />Issues occur with resuming partially watched media.  The playback usually cancels and puts you back to the beginning, losing your current place.  This is probably the largest flaw, and it happens on all of my mobile devices.  Since video gets transcoded on the fly to your device in order to create optimized and compatible formats, I would assume there is an issue with resuming playback while transcoding.  Also, DIVX files are not compatible with PLEX, which mostly affects TV show torrents, but it depends what you have.<br />Overall, PLEX is the single greatest leap forward in Media Serving.  While XBMC is great, PLEX has taken it to the next level.  With its platforms available, polished look, sweet media metadata lookup, it is really the best experience I can currently find for my needs.

0061711292|4.0|A book that was on many people's recommended reads lists. Jean Brodie is a teacher at a girls' school with a following. She's sharp and well-read and clever, which goes against the grain of the educational institution, but she is also flawed and leads her students onto paths that do not always serve them or the world well. Why is it when we find someone we admire we seem to ignore the parts that don't work for us? A cautionary tale, in a sense, for me.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was so anxious to read this book, and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.  A hefty tome involving time-travel, this book was my daily lunch companion for over (2.5) weeks. It's Stephen King at his finest: the subject was extremely well researched, and not the horror fest of King's earliest days as an author.<br /><br />The protagonist is Jake Epping, a 35-year old, divorced, English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine.  He supplements his teacher's income by also teaching GED students.  One of his assignments to the class is to write an essay about an event that had changed their lives.  However, Jake was not prepared for what one of his students, Harry Dunning handed in.  A terribly written, but shocking essay, about the October night in 1958 when his drunken father, came home, flew into a rage and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a severe leg injury that left him with a pronounced limp.  Jake is horrified at what his had read.<br /><br />A short time later, Jake's friend, Al Templeton, who owns a local diner, has aged overnight. He shares a secret, about a portal to the past (September 1958) which is located off a backroom of the diner.  Al urges Jake to try it out, and tells him about what he was working on.  On Jake's first attempt down the rabbit-hole and back in time, his plan is to try to prevent the deaths of Harry Dunning's mother and siblings.  All does not go as planned, and every action taken to undo the past, causes a \\"butterfly effect\\" effecting the future.  When Jake returns to 2011, he sees how sick Al is, and decides to carry out Al's plan, of going back in time to (1958), with all the information currently available about JFK's assassination and work to prevent President Kennedy's death.<br /><br />Jake, travels back in time, from Maine, to Florida to Dallas and then to Jodi, Texas, under his new identity as George Amberson.  He finds a job teaching school, falls in love with a woman named Sadie, and settles down in his new life and new neighborhood waiting for Lee Harvey Oswald and wife Maria to settle in as his neighbor, so that he can keep tabs on all of his moves.<br /><br />Without giving away too many details about the plot, I'll just recommend that you invest the time and read it for yourself.  The characters were fully fleshed out, and the writing drew me in and made me feel like I had been transported back in time as well. Having been born in the early 50's, reading this novel was like a blast from the past. Whether it was the music references, the vehicles, or the laughable price of gasoline, every detail from that period seemed authentic. It's one of those books that if you allow yourself to suspend belief and just go along for the ride, I think you'll agree it was worth your time.life and new neighborhood waiting for Lee Harvey Oswald and wife Maria to settle in as his neighbor, so that he can keep tabs on all of his moves.

0061438294|5.0|Truly a good book, might look cheesy but don't judge this book by the cover literally! Very interesting, good example pictures of different expressions of the body language and facial expressions. It really helps you to understand and read what people are really thinking. Good use for detectives like the writer, psychologists, psychiatrists, even for parents or couples, etc. It really shows you the world from a different point of view!
B002BWP49C|2.0|I am a big fan of the Twilight series love the actors, have read the books more than once, own all 3 previous movies and the music as well! I find them to be all have great qualities in different ways if you expect from them what they are - fun, campy and fantasy, however, I could not have been more dissapointed in the Breaking Dawn movie - lacking in romance, the long awaited sex scene was a yawn, so much of the book was just missing and it was so disjointed it left me with an empty feeling! Can we have a do-over?????

It champions gay  men to are married cheating on their wives. It says a lot of about gay relationships in the one scene where the one character says something like \\"enough of the mushy stuff let's f***\\". It was graphic and just disgusting. I turned it off. I don't even understand the point of this movie except more liberal propaganda.

B00005N6KG|5.0|Are you one of those people who have tried earphones, headphones, and earbuds all their life and did not find something that fits the bill; so here is me, I recently left that club when I purchased these Sony earplugs.<br />Before we start let me tell you why I needed these: I run about 2-3 times a week, and the rest of the days I spend about 20-60 minutes a day in the gym lifting weights. My requirement was I wanted something that can meet the needs of both these environments.<br />These are actually so light, that when I first got them I thought, Sony forgot to put the magnets and have just sent me the frame....disheartened at the thought of making a package, and talking to the customer (un)support staff, and thousand similar thoughts came to my mind. But I connected them to my mp3 and put them into my ears....\\"VOILA\\". They are actually \\"featherweight\\", and for their weight, do more than justice to the bass. These are great for gym/running. I have tried so many other earbuds/plugs (never wrote a review, I guess now you know why).<br />Problems experienced with previous pieces of listening equipment I have tried before:<br />- Too heavy and seems like you are exercising your skull muscles (there are superlight)<br />- The ones with the pop up extension which fits in the ear canal, seems to create a weird sensation and becomes uncomfortable after a while (there just glide into the ear and leave enough space for some air)<br />- Too small & keep falling out (these fit snugly) or<br />- Too big: I had to keep adjusting and would waste 10% of work out time (these are perfect)<br />- No head support....would fall when I ever I ran faster than a snail (these stay put thanks to the head band)<br />- Too little bass to sound like an old fashioned radio (they have perfect amount of bass) or<br />- Too much bass , just thump and no vocals...( again perfect amount of bass)<br />I really am at a loss of words, to find anything wrong with these as of now. But could be an effect of novelty, and because I have tried so many earphones without success, that this sounds like a golden egg to me....but I will update and let you know my experience with time, if it at all changes. These are not Klipsch or Bose, or Senheisers. But none of those fancy things are good for you during the running or workouts, and most importantly none of those above mentioned ones (or even their packaging for that matter) costs 7 $ including shipping.ny earphones without success, that this sounds like a golden egg to me....but I will update and let you know my experience with time, if it at all changes.

1439170916|4.0|Cancer is bad. I know that. My mom has been fighting cancer (and I mean, honestly, fighting---fighting as if she is sword fighting, fighting as if she is wrestling, fighting as if she is boxing---fighting cancer for the past ten years).<br /><br />Mukherjee shows the horror of attempting to fight cancer. It's a fearsome opponent. It can appear beaten yet suddenly it can appear again, this time stronger than ever. It causes horrific pain. It has to be fought with poison and radiation that battle the cancer by killing the body.<br /><br />I liked this book a lot. I did well in following all the medical terms until I hit the chapters that spoke of c-myc genes and ras and Rb in the last quarter of the book. My head began to swivel. I read on. I could feel my brain spinning. I pushed to the end, though I wasn't terribly clear about what I was reading. Way, way over my head.<br /><br />My final assessment:  I wish there'd been an editor to make the last parts of the book more readable for the layman like me. Up until that point, I'd loved the book enough to wish it had been nominated for the best nonfiction of 2010.
B000A2H812|5.0|I do not usually write reviews for music but this cd really impressed me. I have never really been much of a punk fan and I am entirely unfamiliar with traditional gypsy music but the combination of the two really works for me. This album combines fast and furious punk guitar playing and vocals with really catchy and beautiful accordion and fiddle hooks. Eugene Hutz and crew have really done a fantastic job of melding the two genres (and other genres besides) and created something truly unique.<br /><br />I saw Eugene Hutz interviewed and he said something about how music that provides people the opportunity to really lose themselves and let go of their inhibitions is like medicine for the soul or is something the soul craves (I am paraphrasing since I do not remember the exact quote). I think that is a very apt description of Gogol Bordello's music which I would describe from a line from the song Undestructable, \\"Love is a voice of savage soul/This savage love is undestructable\\". This music seems to me to represent a kind of savage love which is certainly like medicine for the soul.<br /><br />I listened to the song Start Wearing Purple before buying this album and really liked it but I was afraid it might be the only song on the album I really liked. I cannot count how many times I have bought an album because I liked one song I had heard on it and wound up not liking the rest of the album. That did not happen with this album. All the songs on this album are quite good and there are at least five songs on the album that I like just as much, if not more, than Start Wearing Purple. So if you have heard and like Start Wearing Purple it is definitely worth buying this album. If you like that song I feel quite certain you will like this entire album.

0385528752|4.0|Let me sum this book up: To change behavior, you must do three things. One, you must change the person's behavior. Two and three, you must change the person's hearts and minds.<br /><br />The authors use the analogy of an Elephant and his Rider. The Rider is your logical brain. The Elephant is your heart. To get the elephant to move, you must engage both the Rider and the Elephant. So, to put it another way, to change behavior, you must Direct the Rider (provide clear direction), Motivate the Elephant (engage people's emotions), and Shape the Path (create the best environment).<br /><br />Here are some more ideas from the book: Keep the Rider (one's mind) busy analyzing why things work well. Ask what small changes can be made to make things work better. The hardest part of change is in the details. What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. Set what Built to Last authors call a BHAG, a Big Hairy Audacious Goal, a goal that hits you in the gut and motivates you, a destination postcard, pictures of a future that hard work can make possible. When it is time to change behavior, our first instinct is to teach them something. Instead, we need to appeal to the heart. If you need quick action, negative emotions might help, but most of the time, it's not a stone-in-the-shoe situation and we need to encourage play, open minds, creativity, and hope. Go ahead and give two stamps toward the goal on the Loyalty Card, what the authors call Shrink the Change, build by providing an early small win. Small targets lead to small victories. Grow your people. Lock your people into identifying with being a great person. Tweak the environment. Create specific action triggers. Build habits. Use the humble checklist.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Had these cases for a few weeks now and love them. They fit perfectly on my iphone 4. I read some reviews complaining that the opening for the lens and flash was too tight resulting in washed out images, but I havn't noticed this. Granted, I haven't used the flash much.  The case itself doesn't feel cheap and provides enough bumper and grip to protect the phone from casual wear without being too bulky. I wouldn't trust it out of a two story window, but then would any amount of protection do that?

B005M2A4D4|5.0|Matt Smith looks to have settled in nicely as the Eleventh Doctor. And a good thing, too, because head cheese showrunner Steven Moffat truly puts the - as an embittered Amy Pond refers to him - \\"blue box man flying thru time and space on whimsy\\" - thru the wringer. Here's DOCTOR WHO: THE COMPLETE SIXTH SERIES, and it's a dark and twisty and gloriously mad season, it is.<br /><br />Who knows what goes on in Steven Moffat's labyrinthine mind? He certainly knows how to deliver a story, knows how to hook you in. More crucially, he's able to introduce an overarching storyline which engages one for the long haul. He's clever with parceling out the occasional tease or plot progression. It's amazing how much I loved Series 5 and yet how much more I love this latest series. These episodes, for the most part, convey surprising emotional heft and a self-assured swagger. There is a richness and a verve. There is this steamrolling effect. It helps that Matt Smith seems to have chemistry with anyone, although the gorgeous Karen Gillan and long-suffering Arthur Darvill truly come into their own this year. Not that the Doctor has had a married couple as companions before, but Amy Pond and Rory would hands down qualify as the most awesomemest (someone please give these two their own spin-off series).<br /><br />How much doozier could you have it than the two-part opener: \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" and \\"Day of the Moon\\"? This arc heralds the Doctor's death, which is set in panoramic Utah, and which unveils in the Silence one of the best big bads in Doctor Who's rogues gallery. The Silence... think Weeping Angels, but in reverse. And to top it off, the two-parter hurls our cast time traveling back to 1963, era of President Nixon and the historical space race. All these elements combine to produce two of the most exciting Doctor Who episodes I've ever seen. Going forward, don't tell me you weren't curious as to how Moffat was going to pull this one off. It's pretty ballsy launching a season by killing off your lead character. The Doctor, murdered at 5:02pm by an astronaut emerging from the waters of Lake Silencio, Utah. It's a mystery what doesn't get resolved until Series 6's final episode.<br /><br />This 6-disc set starts off with the brilliant holiday episode \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" in which the Doctor applies a smidge of time travel to instill conscience in a heartless man, a miserly creature who is \\"halfway out of the dark,\\" meaning there's yet hope for him. Co-starring an excellent Michael Gambon and an ethereal Katherine Jenkins, this ep is already being touted as a classic. And for those who've been raring to learn River Song's true identity, \\" A Good Man Goes to War\\" is your huckleberry, although odds are, you may've already worked it out. I'll be honest and say that I don't really fancy Alex Kingston all that much, so all the drama regarding River Song has left me inhabiting the neighborhood of \\"meh,\\" in the zip code of \\"Huh.\\" Other than the unimpressive \\"The Curse of the Black Spot,\\" Series 6 comes strong with terrific episodes, so strong that it's easier for me to mention the one episode I truly found lacking (again, \\"The Curse of the Black Spot\\"). And, to keep everyone in the proper mood, note that these episodes tend to circle back 'round to the themes touched on in the season opener (the Doctor's looming death, the puzzle of River Song, the Silence's role, etc.). Neil Gaiman demonstrates his virtuoso writing with the magnificent \\"The Doctor's Wife,\\" which showcases possibly the most important woman in the Doctor's life. And while the Doctor struts his stuff in \\"A Good Man Goes to War,\\" I remember it most for Rory's kickarse bracing of the Cybermen.<br /><br />The heartwrenching \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" features perhaps Karen Gillan's best work, as the Doctor and Rory desperately work to save two versions of Amy Pond, only to learn that they can only salvage one. \\"Closing Time\\" is the most lighthearted episode and has the Doctor visitinghis bumbling former flat mate Craig Owens (from \\"The Lodger\\") and meeting Craig's new baby. It's neat that the Doctor can speak baby, and how big was my grin when the Doctor mentions the baby's self-given name: \\"Stormageddon, Lord of All.\\" The Doctor, Craig, and \\"Stormy\\" are just in time to confound a Cybermen invasion being staged from the local department store. Finally, there's no denying the epic scope of \\"The Wedding of River Song,\\" the Series 6 finale, just as there's no denying the jaggedy feel permeating the opening sequences. Still, just bide a bit and it'll sort itself out. Plus, the episode treats you to a Winston Churchill sighting and a moving send-off for the Brigadier. However, one nitpick I nurse is that the creepy eyepatched lady, Madame Kovarian, after the season-long set-up, is given short shrift, is disposed of pretty handily in this ep. But never mind. In \\"The Wedding of River Song,\\" clues are pieced together, mysteries are clarified, while even more questions are asked, including that one all-important (and apparently glaringly obvious) question which begs to be answered in the coming two seasons. And then Silence will fall.

B005BZQS1E|1.0|This movie is terrible and digusting beyond any hope of being entertaining or funny.  Let's see;   Minotaur graphically butt-rapes a slave boy? Check   Child molestation by drug addled puppet/wizard? Check   Genitalia-less troll running around nude? Check   Does it get worse from there? Check  And let's not forget the horrible British accents, bodily function jokes, pratfalls, and other items that may sound like they were going to be funny in a Monty Python kind of way but won't even make you laugh in discomfort. When a movie like this comes out it is obviously meant, in at least a small way, to be a parody. The \\"Fantasy\\" genre is ripe with clichés that just ache to be lampooned and, when done well, you can get an amazing comedy with wit and attention to detail. What this movie did was take the mind of a drunken and lonely middle-school pervert and marry it to swords and sorcerers. When this concept was pitched I bet the studio executives had no idea that this was what the writer really had in mind. When fans heard Natalie Portman and James Franco they figured there was a chance of funny if only to laugh at how bad they were for the parts. They certainly did not expect stories of children jerking off a wizard and Zooey Deschanel trying to devour a severed Minotaur penis. I mean, I didn't expect to be rolling on the floor laughing, but I at least thought we would see a competent attempt at comedy.  Crude comedy is one thing, but this movie should never have been made. This was a cheap excuse to put bad ideas in a bad movie and collect a big paycheck. In a film like this the characters need to play it straight and avoid over acting and \\"nudging\\" the audience to see if they get it. This was more like being smacked in the face with a dead fish and then having the fish smell described to you...for 90 minutes.
0756404738|5.0|I've been reading fantasy for all of my life and this book ranks with the greats, I liked it better than the first book. There is some lenght around the time spent in the Fae world but I think this will come to pay off in the third book. Even if the story did not advance much (only a few years in the Kvothe's life) compared to the first book which encompassed 15+ years, I feel like I am growing up at the same time as Kvothe. His story is really engrossing and it is often hard to put the book down and towards the end you get that sad feeling that its almost over so you savour those last few hundred pages.   It is one of those rare books that I will re-read (in my life I have only re-read Tolkien and Gavriel Kay)
B005R4255C|5.0|First I wasn't sure whether I should buy the CD or not. But after I watched Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour by Cirque du Soleil I decided to buy it. I'm glad I did. It's a nice pep up of the original MJ songs. Just love it.
0446310786|5.0|I was prompted to read this book again after a lot of years after a comment at breakfast by my son who said that I was pouring syrup on my pancakes and  sausage in the manner of Walter Cunningham.  When I asked him who Walter Cunningham was, he replied, of course that he was a character in \\"To Kill A Mockingbird.\\"  I decided to pick up the novel again not only to find out more about Walter Cunningham but to reacquaint myself with this Pulitzer Prize winning book by Harper Lee.  Not surprising I found that I was drawn not only to the characters but to the style of writing.  I couldn't believe that this required book of highschoolers could be so enjoyable to read.  Atticus Finch, the small town lawyer of a small Alabama town is a very quiet, understated, scholarly looking man who is widowed with a small daughter, Scout, and a son Jem. The other member of the household is the African American maid Calpurnia who is more like a mother to Scout and Jem.  They also have a summer friend, called Dill.  Then there is a recluse neighbor named Boo Radley.  Mainly the story deals with Atticus defending a black man who is accused of raping a white young woman.  Naturally there is an outcry in the community and threats which prompt Atticus to sit at the door of the jail with a rifle holding off a gang of folks only too happy to lynch up a black man.  One of the men happens to be the father of Walter Cunningham who is kind of a poor, \\"white trash\\" type of kid who Scout also picks a fight with in school because the teacher has singled him out for not bringing his lunch and offers to give him some money for lunch.  Only Scout tells the teacher that Cunninghams don't accept money from anyone, and incurs the wrath of the teacher for being insubordinate. Walter goes home with the Finch kids for lunch and this is where he does his syrup thing, pouring it all over the meat and potatoes thus getting more grief from Scout who brings this to everyone's attention.  This shouldn't be a big deal but Atticus and Calpurnia take her aside and scold her for not respecting other people's ways no matter how strange they might be.  This theme of respect for human beings also applies to Boo Radley who is  harassed by the Finch kids and their friend, Dill, but in Boo's own manner he tries to communicate with them in various ways.  Even though this book deals a lot with the racial tensions of the South during the 1930s there is a lot more in the pursuit of not only justice for everyone, but also recognizing people for who they are and knowing that everyone has a contribution to make.  This all becomes very evident towards the end of the story when Scout and Jem really find out who really cares for their welfare and safety and who their friends really are!
0817439390|4.0|I liked how the author explains concepts like aperture, shutter, iso etc. w/o resorting to cumbersome charts and technical jargon. I have had my DSLR for several years and Bryan's book helped me (finally) move to manual mode)  Pro  Easy to understand - masterfully outlines basic concepts w/o overwhelming the user with technical jargon, charts and techspeak.  Nice example photos of how to use exposure creatively  Lots of information on exposure w/specialized lenses (telephoto, wide angle, macro)  Has videos on his website for readers to watch  For under $20 it's a worthwhile investment   Cons  - Heavily biased toward outdoor photography (mainly landscapes and cityscapes). The examples and content don't really address indoor/portrait photography. For example, white balance is important for capturing skin tones but the author kind of glosses over the subject by giving his favorite setting, a cool trick and informing the reader that they will have to change settings indoors.  - He is a pro photographer who travels worldwide and has all sorts of fancy lenses. He doesn't always bother to define the various types of lenses before launching into tips and tricks on how they affect exposure.  This sort of implies that part of his audience has the budget for all sorts of advanced lenses and already understands this stuff.  - Low light photography is covered but only for outdoor photography. He says he's now OK with 'fill flash' but only gives some examples of outdoor photographs where he uses some sort of external flash to augment the lighting. He also talks about ring flash but this also seems a bit advanced.  - I joined a women's photography forum and was immediately told that an f 1.4 or 1.8 35 or 55 'prime lens' would help me deal with low light indoor photography - the author doesn't mention this, presumably because of his focus on outdoor photography.  - I wish the book had more practical examples and exercises for a new photographer with a basic camera.

B004EPYZU8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and it was shipped on time and in great condition! Everyone should buy this!
B003O86FMW|3.0|If you liked Hunger Games you will like this book also because its the same story. Somehow Katniss is back in the games and the capital is still the big bad but everything works out in the end. Not bad but kind of feels like a photocopy of a photocopy, so if you line the first book you'll like this one too, only every pay off or twist is lessened because you've already been there before.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Do not start watching this unless you are prepared to watch at least 2 or 3 of them a night until you've watched the entire series.  Really great acting, really great story line.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Looks like an Antigue book on my shelf.  However my new Kindle Fire is not on the shlef long. I almost cancelled this order for the cover because my neighbor was telling me about the one she ordered.  But I am sentimental this was the cover my husband wanted me to buy.  I am glad I did.

B005PK5C12|5.0|I LOVE this show!!!  Everything about it leaves me wanting more....I have been buying this series online since the 3rd or 4th episode...but now that it's the day after the finale I am waiting and waiting and still waiting to watch....come on, Amazon!  Get your head out of your ass and deliver!!!!  I want my last installment!!!!!  (I really love this show...)
0064430227|5.0|I bought this book to read to my grandson. He's only 3 1/2 and although he liked it, it's not one of his favorites. Maybe he's too young. I will continue to read it to him, because I like the book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's easy to see why they are making this into a movie. Pretty teenagers fighting to the death in a post apocalyptic world - that script sell itself! The world building is just right for this YA book, not too detailed, not too preachy, not too political, it is clear who is the vilain (they have almost no redeeming qualities) and then the action is fast and you do feel a real sense of dread for some of the participants. It's a good quick read - perfect for a vacation or plane flight.
1419702238|5.0|I was not expecting this book to arrive so soon, so I definitely will buy from this seller again. Very well packaged even though it was with other items, everything was protected. My son will love it when he open it on Christmas day, he collects Diary of a Wimpy Kid and he has been wanting this latest addition!
B0015AARJI|1.0|Beware for those who wants to purchase PS3 controllerthat is below $40, especially from ThinkCheapGeeks.  I too became a victim of cheap knockoff controller.  First off, the delivery took way too long, nearly a MONTH. I ordered the controller on Nov. 27th and the darn thing arrived around Dec. 20th! Nearly a month? For a controller? Really?  The product came all the way from China and I became skeptical due to the story of fake products China makes (they even made iPhone 5G which is obviously fake). The moment I opened the package, I immediately recognized the controller being cheap knockoff. The right analog stick is elevated compared to left analog stick. Both analog sticks makes a very loud clicking noise when pushed. The analog stick doesn't feel smooth at all. When I hold the controller in my hand the plastic edges are sharp and I feel like it's digging through my skin. The triggers and bumpers are very springy and feels uncomfortable to push. The X button feels like it's stuck. Also when I shake my controller I hear a rattling noises.  I requested for a return but ThinkCheapGeeks closed my request. So not only I got a cheap knockoff controller, I can't get my money back!  You get what you pay, BEWARE PURCHASING CHEAP CONTROLLER AND STAY AWAY FROM THINKCHEAPGEEKS.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it, its so addicting and hours of fun. great mixture of many games. I have played this game everyday since I bought it.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I don't really understand how these movies can draw out so much money, and yet they're just completely dumb. I guess when you have a self-centered tween-age girl and a few shirtless men and \\"vampires\\" that sparkle, I guess thats your box-office win in a nut-shell.  I had went to see the previous movies that followed before this, and had hopes that something would change about these fake vampires that sparkle, but it looks like all most people can do right now is wait till this Twilight phase ends. As quoted from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine \\"Twilight Is Cat-Nip For Fraidy-Cats!\\" The dialogue in the movies are gawd-awful, and I have not seen acting this bad since Bruce Springsteen's first divorce. This is the most sanitized vampire movie you'll come across.  Like I said: how these movies really are succesfull in the box offices, 1 can only wonder. Here a few vampire movies I do recommend, but then again, they might be too realistic for anyone going on the Twilight-only initiative.  Underworld  Van Helsing  Interview With The Vampire  Let Me In  The Lost Boys
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I started reading GOT when it first came out in the 90's but I didn't finish it. At the time I was into more juvenile and standard fantasy (like Feist and Tolkien) and the slow pace of GOT and some boring POV charachters (Catelyn and Sansa) turned me off. But when the HBO series began I picked up this omnibus and re-read much of GOT and then the rest of the series and now 15 years after first starting GOT it is much more to my liking, everything in this world seems real and even some POV characters which were bad in GOT began to be really interesting later on (i.e. Sansa). The series is still bloated with useless POV and exposition but overall it is fun and thrilling and contains some of the best moments in all of fantasy. A feast for crows is really a by let down hovewer, you could almost skip all the Cersei and Brienne chapters except their last one and not miss a thing.
B004U52VPS|5.0|PAID TOO MUCH FOR THIS GAME  ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS I COULD HAVE BOUGHT IT at target or walmart
B004T6IBNY|4.0|As pinball simulators go, this is one of my favorites. It's got some great action and really looks good on the Kindle Fire.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book (and the whole of the series) is undoubtedly my absolute favorite. It is wonderful, suspensful, and so many other words that I can't describe it.   Suzanne Collins has done a excellent job of showing you how cruel people in life can be, what lengths people will go to for power, and the courage of the few people who actually try to stop it.  &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; is basically about a girl, Katniss Everdeen, and her love, her devotion, her perserverance, and her survival. The way she protects her family, the way she stands for wat she believes, how she can withstand all the pain and torture in her life, it's all so beautifully described, so clearly explained, that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action.  Suzanne Collins did and absolutely amazing job with this book, as with all her others. I highly recommend this to anyone, no matter the age.  However, the movie of this book is coming out March 23, 2012, and it's rated PG13 for violence. I suggest that if you're under 12, you shouldn't watch it unless you can stand to watch people being torn apart and blown up, to name a few.

B00021R7CG|4.0|Technical Details-This DVD was in English with no options for other languages. Audio was Dolby Digital AC3(per InterVideo WinDVD7 Info button) and the DVD case stated English 2.0(stereo?)and Dolby Surround but there were no audio options available on the DVD. There were no detectable audio problems. Case stated Closed Captioned but there were no options available on the DVD. Picture was color and displayed perfectly on my 4:3 format TV(case states aspect ratio 4:3). Picture detail was good with only 2 video imperfections on this DVD detected, a matrix of white dots across top of screen and a red spot over the face of the copilot(in order of appearance), but these were momentary defects. Scene access performed using Chapter Selections but note they are in text form only, no thumbnail images available to help you navigate quickly to a scene. There were no extras on this DVD.  This DVD did play on my Windows 7 Ultimate PC with a Dell HD monitor and resolution set at 1900 x 1200, using both Windows Media Player 12 and VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. The picture displayed with vertical black bars on each side of the picture for both Windows Media Player 12 and VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. Resolution was not as good as on my 4:3 format TV. HD monitors vary in their ability to down convert a signal source(720p) below its capability(full HD).  On my Windows XP SP3 laptop with resolution set at 1400x1050 using InterVideo WinDVD 7 software, the picture displayed better than on the HD monitor and the software controls are better as well than either Windows Media Player 12 or VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. The picture displayed with vertical black bars on each side of the picture like both Windows Media Player 12 and VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10 on my Windows 7 Ultimate PC, except that the bars were much thinner compared to those displayed on my Dell monitor.
B001V9LRV0|1.0|Ordered this item expecting the description to actually match what I received in the mail. Silly me!  Item description states that the package includes bonus extras like a Life magazine excerpt reprint, fancy 'fringed' packaging, patch, etc.  Nope- what showed up was a simple plastic DVD sleeve with discs rattling around inside. Since it's a gift I haven't opened to to see how bad the damage is, or what the quality of the actual video and sound is, but let's just say I don't have very high hopes. Buyer beware, if you're thinking of ordering this, all you're going to get is a couple discs... and disappointed. 'MovieMars' was the vendor.
B0050KEVO6|2.0|Got really boring after I found 100 or so combinations.  Then I just felt like all there was to do was pick one and mix it with the others to see what illogical combination came up next. I wanted it to be the awesome game so many other reviews have called it, but I gave up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought the book on Friday night, and read the last page on Saturday morning. This was an enthralling read. Well-written, and full of meaningful characters, the book goes beyond the traditional dystopian style and presents a very real world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book so long as you are not faint of heart: the violent and cruel world--much like our own--in which it is based is at times painful to experience.
B005XN0SGU|2.0|I was looking forward to reading comics on KF, unfortunately my experience with Perfect Viewer has not been good. This app has a decent and smooth viewer but it has lots of fragility. It gives frequent \\"low memory\\" and bails out or force closes, maybe the result of too much speed optimization. It first choked on scanning. I had to kill and restart it to get to the shelf. Strangely, it spends a few seconds scanning each time you go to the shelf which is kind of frustrating when you are quickly previewing the comics. Changing image re-sizing options made it to choke on slideshow and once again I had to kill and restart. I'll try the other readers or else I'll have to go back to my iPad.
0553801473|5.0|i really loved this book!  i didn't love or hate the last book,  but this one seemed to get back to the core characters that i really love
1416972242|5.0|Book #2 City of ashes, I will have to say it only took me 5 days to read book 1, 2 & 3... I liked them all and it was hard to put the book down and leaving the world. I have not read series take me away from reality for a long time!
B004LUS390|4.0|I love it on iPad, but it seems a little jumpy on Kindle Fire, especially when zoomed in close. As well, stroke smoothing--like towards the end of the stroke--looks, well, not so smooth, again especially when zoomed in. I guess its just Android? or is it the Kindle? (probably the Kindle...I hope)<br /><br />also wtf is this? .10 crossed out and the price is 1.99? Thanks Amazon. :P maybe I should have waited till it dropped in price again. so far I think ive paid more than any other reviewer for this app.<br /><br />I'll probably stick to the iPad for this app. So I guess I wasted two bucks just to review it.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|It was such a blockbuster deal for only $79, compare to regular priced at $250 or more.  As soon as I saw the deal, I purchased the set without hesitation.  The DVD set arrived in pristine condition, beautifully packaged in hot pick velvety cover with beautiful pictures of the ladies. I've seen each episode at least 10+ times, and I am ready to savor every single episode once again and again at my my fingers.  This was truly the best XMas gift I bought for myself.
B006C45CFG|2.0|Good cg great cast. Script made of garbage.<br />Harrison Ford is basically playing what i would call old Han Solo, but its mostly in a good way, though the script never seems to figure out how to make him the anti hero/scoundrel he's supposed to be.<br />Everytime something bad happend to a character, I kept wondering why I don't care.Probably has something to do with the lack of character development.<br />There was moment after moment of missed opprotunities with cg and action, plot development, cohesion and so on.<br />Machete had better character development.<br />mk?
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|i ordered this product only tow days ago and i already got it... its amazing and its practically brand new and i love it ! cannot wait to see the look on my boyfriends face when he sees it!! :) thank you so much!
1416972250|5.0|I pretty much knew the twist as it gave off hints in other 2 books. The wait was well worth it, I was hoping for a little more at the end, however we still got book 4 to come, then book 5 will be released in May 2012... I am thinking many people were disappointed in the twists and turns, but, I felt this was the beauty of it as well as making us wait for what we all want to happen.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|If you like your blood and debauchery in Roman costumes (or often out of them) then you'll love this prequal series to the \\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand\\" series about the adventures of the famed rebel slave's early career.
B005SV9X22|4.0|Had the pleasure of seeing this tour as a birthday present in New Orleans. She and the crew were amazing. I was really upset that some of the interludes were cut out.

B005K2XNGG|5.0|I just received it in the mail today, and although the shipping took a little long, I'd say it was worth it. The material feels very durable and is tough on the outside and soft on the inside. The colors are pretty too :)
B00127RAJY|5.0|Okay. So, I'm 40-something-ish and about 30 pounds heavier than I'd like to be. As a writer, my work is very sedentary and let's face it, I really just hate to exercise and had not done any more than walk in a long time. No...it's not that I hate to exercise, it's that I hate taking time for myself when I could be getting work done. Anyway, so I'd been looking for an effective workout routine that I could fit into my busy busy schedule. My cousin, (God rest her soul after I get through with her), recommended the 30-day shred. She had been doing the workouts over the summer and started them again a few weeks ago to bring in the new year a little healthier. (She's a barbie mind you.)<br /><br />After watching her facebook updates on her progress for some time, I finally decided to give it a try. It's only twenty minutes out of my day right??? Ohhhh...how wrong I was. I'm on DAY 5, and this is one of the toughest workouts--even at level one--but I already feel so much better. Here are a few observations. 1. Being 30 pounds over my ideal weight, I was afraid I might have a heart attack with this routine because everyone said it was so tough. No...you won't have a heart attack, not even close. You will sweat.  You will hurt. You won't die. 2. I had a torn MCL a few years ago in my knee and feared it might be too tough on my knees. No--I don't feel anymore than my usual pains in my joints. 3. I feared I might get bored. No--If you're doing the workout properly, you're too focused on ensuring you intake oxygen to get bored.<br /><br />Everyday you'll grow to hate Jillian just a little bit more, but you'll feel better for it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this video for those of us thick and fat people who are trying to begin a healthier lifestyle. After only 5 days, I feel more energetic and I'm not nearly as winded when I do the video or take the stairs for that matter. Trust me, you will HATE Jillian but you will love how you feel.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Having been a Tony Bennett fan for longer that I care to admit, I heard Tony promoting the Duet CD in conjunction with the celebration of his 80th birthday.  I then checked it out on Amazon and saw that there was a Duets I, of course, as well as the Duets II.  Needless to say, I had to have them both and am enjoying them enormously.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Just when you think filmmakers cannot milk anymore out of the WWII genre along comes Paul Verhoeven. Those who only know his English language popcorn movies (Basic Instinct, Total Recall, Showgirls) will be in for a surprise.<br /><br />This is one of the most intelligent and clever scripts ever filmed. Literally there are numerous times when the surprises in the film you truly never see coming. That's what makes this flick a total thrill ride as well as an amazing work in capturing the \\"look\\" of the latter days of WWII in German-occupied, and later liberated, Holland.<br /><br />In the end this film does not work at all without Carice Van Houten who as the fulcrum around which all the mystery and thrills revolves pulls off this role of a lifetime.<br /><br />Of course, no Verhoeven flick can be shot without the requisite babes showing their assets so fans of that aspect of the randy old Dutchman will also not be disappointed but unlike Showgirls, the choices seem to actually work within the context of the script.<br /><br />The extras are just a director's commentary track and a making of where we get to know some good bits about the Dutch and German actors esp. the real-life friendship between the two main female actors and also this tidbit--the entire film cost just 16 million euros.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Last year, the Swedish version of Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name was my favorite movie of the year.  I know, it was released in 2009, but in my area it hit theaters in 2010.  In any case, it was and is a great film.  How could it be improved and why would an American director want to try?  I was very skeptical.  American filmmakers don't usually improve on originals, but there are some exceptions.  Ironically, a recent re-do from Sweden is another example.  I loved \\"Let the Right One In\\", but thought \\"Let Me In\\" was a modest improvement.<br /><br />Director David Fincher pulls it off here as well.  There are differences between the two films but they are not substantive.  What is different is the production value.  More on that in a minute.  The opening pushes you back in your seat with Led Zeppelin's \\"The Immigrant Song\\" covered by Karen O and Trent Reznor.  It plays over a series of fluid steel grey images.  It's hard to describe, but it gets your attention.  The plot differs little from the previous movie and presumably the novel (which I haven't read).  The editor of a Swedish magazine is found guilty of liable based on questionable journalism.  His finances are decimated and his magazine is in jeopardy of going under.  Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig at his best), needing income accepts the position of biographer for one of Sweden's wealthiest men and the head of a family that includes former Nazi's in its ranks.<br /><br />Mikael's real job however is to find out what happened to the niece of the ranking family head (Christopher Plummer).  The niece who was 16 at the time of her disappearance in the mid-1960's, is believed to have been murdered and Henrik (Plummer) believes family members were responsible.  He wants Mikael to investigate.  Needing help he hires Lisbeth Salander (award-worthy Rooney Mara) who had been recommended by the family's attorney.  Mikael is unaware that she had been doing a background investigation on him as part of Henrik's vetting process.<br /><br />Mara jumps into this role with both feet, as well as other body parts, and is remarkable.  She brings a smoldering fury to the character that has sociopathic tendencies, the result of abuse as a child.  We don't know the details (next movie) but it's there.  Lisbeth is a bi-sexual wisp of a young woman.  Body piercings are in seen and unseen places, she is covered in tattoos, has a spiked haircut, bleached eyebrows and dresses in black leather (goes with her motorcycle).  It's hard not to be distracted by this exterior, but later in the film Lisbeth takes on another identity, that of a beautiful blond rich socialite and Mara pulls that off too.<br /><br />The reason the film is so noteworthy is the detail.  Set in Sweden using a mixture of European and American English speaking actors, it's hard to differentiate between native Swedes and others.  The photography is astounding.  The film jumps between urban Stockholm and a remote island, 4 hours away by train.  The film has some brutal violence, not the least of which is rape of Lisbeth by her \\"guardian.\\"  This is tough to watch but if you appreciate revenge, just wait.  Another modification Fincher made involves the relationship between Mikael and Lisbeth.  To put it bluntly they have more sex.  Their relationship is warming.  There is a real connection.  You can see Lisbeth changing.  She's feeling better about herself.  Mikael?  He's had a long romantic relationship with his publisher Erika (Robin Wright) and it appears that hasn't changed.  Lisbeth's long disappearance in the next film will make more sense.  Earlier I mentioned the opening song, I should add that Reznor and Atticus Ross wrote the music for this film and it fits the scenes perfectly.  This is a brilliant, well made movie with some outstanding performances and is at the top of my list for 2011.ting process.<br /><br />Mara jumps into this role with both feet, as well as other body parts, and is remarkable.

B005HSL626|4.0|The two main issues that most of these people have can be solved by,  1) BUY the game. Someone put time and effort into this game. Nothings free in this world so why would you think you can get a free game without ads?? Stop being cheap. 2) BUY a better phone. Again, stop being cheap.   The only complaint I have about this game is the graphics. I'd gladly pay another dollar for HD graphics for my gnex. Other than that, awesome game!

B005DF2QMC|1.0|This seems nice in concept, however the software comes only on a mini-disc.  The slot on my laptop cannot accommodate a mini disc.  I emailed the manufacturer asking if I can get the software in full size CD or a download and they never even replied.  Since I cannot access the software, I returned the unit as unusable.  I also did not appreciate the lack of reply and non-existing customer service.  BUYER BEWARE.
B006LS7DQE|4.0|Love the game, but on my Kindle Fire the game feels choppy when actually playing the game. Movement in the world seems fine though.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I love Zooey Deschanel as an actress and have loved her music for years. She's got a beautiful voice and I knew I had to have this when I first heard it mentioned! It's definitely been the source of my Christmas spirit this year! I've listened to it at least once a week since it's been released!
B006FTCH2E|1.0|I had seen the trailer and was horrified by the idea of what would happen to Earth and other planets due to the gravity suck of this new planet. Hell, the planet couldn't even have gotten there, without major astrophysical calamity! I wanted desperately to see how this would be handled. It wasn't. This and the hundreds of other scientific issues were not addressed, much to my disgust.   After wasting my time and money, I was given to understand that the entire charade was a metaphor for personal growth and renewal. I feel like throwing rotten tomatoes at the rental box.

0345423496|1.0|After traversing the ever expanding story arc of 2001, 2010, and 2061, the finale was a supreme letdown and major disappointment. Part of the tragedy lies in the evolution of science fiction writing itself. Contemporary sci-fi writers are much more nuanced, subtle, and sophisticated. While there is still some of the simplistic alien wars with bizarre lifeforms (usually for no reason), the majority of sci-fi writing today is for an educated, adult audience that includes exploration of societal organization and interpersonal relationships in addition to the standard advances in physics, biology, medicine, electronics, and computers.   3001 is written more in the style of pre-1950's sci-fi where the audience was primarily pre-adolescent boys. The science and technology is not terribly engaging. Clarke's philosophical meanderings are mostly a distraction to the story. One gets the impression that Clarke is frustrated that the future is not turning out as he originally envisioned. Finally, the expectation for some resolution of the monolith structures is left wanting. Clarke appears to be \\"stuck\\" in a time warp of old-fashioned (rather than classical) sci-fi writing style that is simply unsatisfying today.  For those looking for closure with the whole 2001 saga, by all means read 3001; it's relatively short and quite readable.

Her voice and interpretation of the lyrics are so clear and wonderful.  She sounds like she loves to sing.  Her tribute to her son Terry brought tears to my eyes.  His song was just as beautiful.  If you don't have any of her previous recording, start out with this one.  You'll fall in love with Doris Day just as I have.  God bless her.
1609611543|4.0|Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health<br /><br />By William Davis, MD<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-60961-154-5 (Rodale Books, 2011)<br /><br />This book should persuade us all to eliminate wheat from our diet. It is an unhealthy whole grain! Although the cardiologist author is guilty of a little hyperbole, he makes an excellent case that consumption of wheat is the main cause of obesity and diabetes in the United States, along with other inflammatory conditions such as arthritis and many skin disorders. Wheat is the only grain that crosses the blood-brain barrier, which causes appetite stimulation and an addictive response in the brain. The author presents scientific data explaining his thesis and case histories showing disease resolved once wheat consumption is halted. Immediate weight loss occurs when wheat is eliminated from the diet and obesity disappears along with the inflammation it causes. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease are then reversed.<br /><br />Sheryl Sanchez, L.Ac., Heavenly Herbs and Acupuncture
B00003CX5P|3.0|Consideing all the negative reviews pertaining to this film and the entire prequel trilogy, I would say not deny them. Compared to the original Star Wars movies, this first episode has nowhere near the quality of character development, plot pacing, story cohesian, or general likability. What does it have? Good special effects and fun action scenes.   While this is entitled Star Wars, is written and directed by George Lucas, and does contain all the elements and \\"pre\\" characters (i.e. young Obi-wan, young Darth Vader, Yoda, etc) that were found in the original Star Wars films, do not think of this as a REAL Star Wars movie. Better, think of it as one of those shameless rip-off of big budget movies, straight-to-DVD releases you see whenever you walk into your local video store to rent a movie. That is to say, while this does contain elements that are supposed to lead up to the birth of Darth Vader, do not take ANYTHING in this (or the oter prequel) seriously, as for strange unknown reasons George Lucas decides to throw in a lot of very strange and completely senseless plot holes and explanations of why things exist in the Star Wars universe. One example being the strange explanation of the Force, and where it comes from. Just ignore all of it. Take this movie as a 2 hour romp of cute special effects and big budget light-saber action. That's it.   So ignore the completely horrid and stiff wooden acting, all the eerily weird plot explanations shamelessly injected by George Lucas, bad writing, and all the senseless plot development that simply make no sense at all.

B005OCFHHK|4.0|If you like HP movies, you will like these. If you are a HARD CORE Potter fan, THIS IS NOT THE SET FOR YOU. Wait for the ultimate set that will be released soon. But if you are like me and just like the story and the magic, then this is the one. The High Definition quality gets better around the 4th disk. Over all, it's a nice set. The casing is very fragile, be careful letting kids handle it.  I have to complain about the way it was shipped to me. The box was opened and I feared the set was not there. It also was not protected with anything, no bubble wrap, paper, nothing! It was moving around in the box. The set itself was sealed and didn't look like anyone had tried to open it. When I opened it, it was just fine. I just think Amazon personnel need to be careful.

B0056BMK6K|3.0|If you are thinking of purchasing this book in hopes that you can have similar success selling YOUR book as John has had selling his then there are two things you need to know. 1. A huge part of Locke's success is that he has 8 or 9 books to sell. I believe he said he wrote 9 books in a two years period. Well, most good authors take one year to write one book, and that's working at if full time. Great authors sometimes take 5 to 10 years for one book. Bottom line: if you don't have several books to sell right away you're not going to have the success he has. Quantity is as important as quality... maybe more important, with his method. 2. Using Locke's method you will have to work nearly full time marketing your book. So, unless you are financially independent and can work 30 plus hours a week marketing your book than his method won't work for you like it has for him.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you don't meet the above two criteria but you are willing to work hard then he gives a lot of practical advise that will probably pay off over time. Just don't expect to sell a million books in five months.

1936719118|5.0|I read this book based on recommendation from a good friend. I am glad I did. I finished it in couple of hours. I just couldn't put the book down.  For a number of years, I have been struggling to start my own company and I have read countless of business books and articles and all I got was the experts telling me how to do it in the \\"correct\\" way. Derek Sivers's book changed my thinking on that. Instead of trying to be a copycat, Derek says it is fine to be original and stick to your guns. Fail often and enjoy learning from your mistakes. Don't focus on reaching the finish line as quickly as possible. What is the rush? Instead take time to take detours if that makes you happy. According to Derek, you wouldn't join a marathon and then take a taxi to the finish line.  From Derek's experience, there is no one right way to do anything. There are always multiple (and valid) ways to accomplish the same thing. It is more important to be true to your own self and your own values than trying to be successful based on the opinion of others. This is a book that will stand the test of time.  I hope Derek pursues motivational speaker role in the future. With the depression we are facing and economic hardships, Derek's voice is what we need to hear the most now and what can lead us in more better and balanced future.

B005PYZG6E|1.0|Its pretty darn hard to use, and not to mention before I could get through all of my testing on the product. The handle was loose out of the box, leaving me with a nearly unusable product (impossible to properly balance). Not super easy to balance with a DSLR, and forget about a T2i with 18-135 IS lens, worked (sort of) with my 50mm f1.8, but that meant a more telephoto lens on a run and gun rig. bottom line, Id spend the extra 50$ to get something much better that isn't a waste of your time or money.  Update, Did some more testing, with my gopro, even with that small camera the balance was all off, the gimbal is too restrictive to get the really fluid side to side motions that I see on many other stabilizers
0307719774|4.0|For some reason I thought this book would be much bigger - a normal-sized journal. I had intended to paste a Christmas card from the person who bought it for me on the inside cover. But I had to laugh at that idea when it arrived - it's a stout, stubby little book, would be pocket-sized if it weren't so thick, and this dramatically reduces the amount of space there is on the page to write. I already knew I'd have trouble fitting my thoughts into a few lines given a *regular* size page, but with these miniature pages it's going to be a real challenge to condense my answers to be able to fit!   Still, I love the concept, the questions, the overall look of the book, and the gilded pages. Shiny! Can't wait to get started.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I rarely give reviews but after reading these I had to add my two cents.  I really enjoyed this book.  I read it in three days because I did not want to put it down.  I have to argue with the people that say this book has no science.  I think it is very similar to Jurassic Park only with bugs instead of dino's.  It was a page turner.  The science is there and is focused around bugs an their world which is really fascinating.  I would read it again.  Glad I spent the money.

0446556750|2.0|Well, I admit it, I haven't read \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" yet, and chances are, after the vast disappointment with \\"The Reversal,\\" I won't even try. To his credit, though, I concede that Michael Connelly might feel the pressure to follow up on the commercial success of his bestselling novel, and it shows in a work that leaves a feeling of dissatisfaction, mainly due to the impression that Connelly actually submitted an unfinished work.<br /><br />It is ironic, but there are literally hundreds of thousands of aspiring, but unsuccessful authors in the US alone, full of inspiration, and their heads are filled with numerous, brilliant ideas for new novels, but in the end, they fail either due to lack of talent, lack of perseverance, or both. Connelly is unquestionably blessed with the craftsmanship of a superb writing style, but the \\"The Reversal\\" offers no more excitement than a regular show of \\"Law & Order.\\"<br /><br />In fact, Connelly's writing draws you into the story line, and real soon you feel the urge to read on and on, and you finally reach the devastatingly disappointing conclusion, if you can call it a conclusion. You look at the last page in disbelief, wondering if you missed something. Maybe you bought a copy missing pages at the end.<br /><br />Throughout the story line, there are hints pointing to the potential of unexpected twists and turns, but the moments of awe are sorely missing. Simply said, there are no unexpected twists or turns, but some unnecessary fillers increasing the word count. And this is where Connelly is in dire need of some inspiration.<br /><br />- Wilfried F.

0767817729|4.0|Many people gave this a 1-2 star review because of the VIOLENCE...grow up and read the MPAA rating before you watch it...hint hint: if the movie is Rated \\"R\\" it might be scary or mean or maybe say bad words like poo poo or pee pee.   In all honesty, this movie is excellent. I first watched it on TNT before I was a teenager and the old school, drawn-out Revenge process took me in. Costner is awesome as usual but the plot and real life \\"tragedy\\" makes this movie great. Its one of those movies where you wish you could be in the film and turn things around towards the end (that's how deep it takes you!)  Again, don't mind the ones who gave the film a bad rating because its violent (The title should speak for itself), etc., watch it and see for yourself.

This is a great American story, very much of its time. The feeling while reading most of the book is that Jobs was a real jerk...and he pretty much admits it. But his humanity, his genius, and his beauty shows through. I found the book very moving. RIP Steve.
B000R8YC18|5.0|\\"Taxi Driver\\" is a psychological thriller film where the viewer stands in the shoes of deluded Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro. Bickle presents as a social misfit who is looking for a job to fill his sleepless nights. His reality is certainly skewed as he takes a potential girlfriend, Betsy, to a pornographic movie screening as a first date. From Bickle's point of view the decay of society surrounds him, and he seeks to rid the city of seedy elements. Iris, a child prostitute, becomes a reason for him to carry out his plan, and she in many ways is an important focus in his life. De Niro convincingly plays Bickle with a deadpan persona that is driven purely by an invented concept of right and wrong.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

1573229725|3.0|I learned of this book while reading a biography of Willkie Collins.  Fans of Collins and Dickens might enjoy this unusual take on mid-18th century life from a female viewpoint.  The story drags on a bit, but there are entertaining twists here and there.  Of more interest to female readers than male readers, although I reject the notion that it's only for lesbians.
B005E94WB0|4.0|I couldn't beat the price on this case. While an ear piece in a case is larger than just sticking one in your pocket, I found it useful to have a case to protect the not inexpensive Bluetooth. I don't use the belt clip because my phone is enough to carry.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK. I HAVE COME ACROSS THIS BOOK SEVERAL TIMES BUT HAVE NEVER PURCHASED IT TO READ. I SAW THE PREVIEWS FOR THE MOVIE. SO I DECIDED TO BUY IT. I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I READ IT IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND CANT WAIT TO READ THE NEXT TWO. IT IS A GREAT READ. THIS HAS BECOME ONE OF MY FAVORITE TRILOGIES. AS GOOD AS THE TWILIGHT SERIES. THE ROMANCE IS GREAT WITH ALOT OF ACTION.

B005FMZX9Q|4.0|This is a larger watch from Invicta. I like the face of it, but on closer inspection the watch appears pretty cluttered with some of the numbers cut off from the chronograph functions. The watch itself seems like it is made of good construction, but I'm not sure I'm sold on the strap yet. It looked pretty cheap coming out of the box, but it looks better on. I guess this watch could double for both casual and dress uses, but I will probably use it for casual only.
034552554X|3.0|I loved the concept of the Victorian language of flowers, and really did enjoy that aspect of the book. The whole which flowers represent what was really interesting and informative.<br />As for the whole story element of the book I am sad to say I found the pace rather slow, and that spoilt the enjoyment of the book for me. Others may also love the story but it just was not my cup of tea I'm afraid. It sounded so romantic, and promising from the blurb but in my opinion failed to deliver. I have read many of the reviews out and about on this book and lots of people seem to have really enjoyed it so, don't let me put you off giving it a go.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Being a huge MMA fan I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but boy was I in for a surprise.  The story was good and the action was pretty good as well.  I was surprised to see a few well known fighters as well as one WWE star in the movie.  The story was very moving.  The movie is a bit long, but didn't seem like it because it was very exciting.
B004A8ZX2I|5.0|I been looking for this movie on the stores since it came out and couldent find it! I am so glad I found it here. It is a great prize,specially being blue ray. It was used but in perfect condition. This is my fav movie of the year, hands down! : )
B005DKLPF6|5.0|I'll admit, I'm new to the Mastodon scene:  becoming a blip on my radar with Crack the Skye, I didn't realize in less than 2 years Mastodon would rise to top 3 status in my rankings in such short order.  This realization occurred when 'The Hunter' came to fruition, thus embarking an odyssey harkening in the back catalog, countless YouTube hours watching interviews, videos, live performances, etc...  What I can tell you: it was worth every second, and learning and appreciating more and more of the greatest metal band of the last decade (easily, for me).    To enlighten you to anything you couldn't digest from a more verbose reviewer already wrote would be difficult, so I will leave you with wise words:  pick this record up and appreciate it for the brilliance and musician-ship of a concoction of four extremely talented, dedicated crafters of epic-ness!  (Also, go see them live and have your face melted off)
B005K0HDGE|3.0|The time travel setup is very compelling and the opening of the book fascinating, offering very detailed observations of life in this century and life in the last. The spiritual oddness of traveling to this earlier time seems gripping at first. Then Stephen King becomes Stephen King: master of horror. There are several unnecessary subplots with lots of horror and pain, and by the time you get through them you are tired of the whole book. Yet just when I wanted to put down the book from boredom or irritation with the carnage, a new subplot would emerge that kept me going. Fundamentally what got me to the end of this much too long book was that I wanted to know how it would end, would he stop the Kennedy assassination, and if he did, what would happen? Once you finally get to this finale, it feels rushed and not very compelling. This book would have benefited from a developmental editor willing to tell Stephen King that the plot itself is twisted and interesting enough, you don't need quite so much blood and gore.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|Logan's Run is one of my faves! I was so happy to find it for such an inexpensive price. Definitely a surprise as I wasn't even looking for it. But, for the price, I can introduce my god daughters to the joys of old school sci fi!<br /><br />Haven't watched this dvd yet, so I can only assume (for now) that the product is functioning properly. Will post otherwise if need be but not expecting problems as it is not used.<br /><br />Watched the DVD and there are no flaws. Great flick.
B001O54NKS|3.0|The description of this Dokken CD, provided by Amazon, is misleading, as it refers to a Japanese edition, not to the product you are looking at. The disclamer about product description referring to a Japanese print CD was not always there, it appeared (supposedly after similair complains) after I have ordered this CD. If I'd known that it is not a Japanese edition, I would rather look for a remastered edition of this album. I have to admit that recording quality is OK, however I would rahter know what I am buying beforehand. This all seems to be a simple database fault, but leaves unpleasant impression about the Amazon service that overall I rate as one of the best globally.
B004WPYO4C|4.0|Mike Leigh is toying with sexual politics in this bleak film. I won't say that rape is \\"glorified\\" because it's often consensual encounters that suddenly become violent. That may make feminists even more angry...there's little definition of just what degree of violation occured and whether the loser women expected many sexual boundaries.  Both men seemed likely to wind up dead or in prison by age 40.  One is quite terrifying while the other (main character)is merely misguided.  No happy endings here.

B000005AYM|5.0|When Erykah Badu released this album soul/R&B/funk was in a something of a transitional holding pattern between the era of D'Angelo and TLC to Jill Scott and Alicia Keys. In the middle of this there would be Maxwell and Badu. She did indeed kind of burst onto the scene in 1997 and since then has never looked back. It was apparent that despite the insistence of the 90's decade hip-hop could not exist as the sole basis for furthering soul and funk music. There was going to have to be,using what became something of a buzz word for the decade,an alternative to that. Again it became a matter of voids. Lauryn Hill would soon be along to provide one such sound of her own. But there were just too many voids and a future unknown. For her own self Badu is one of those people who marches to the beat of her own drummer. And that would be a jazz drummer if she had anything to do with it because that was where she came from. Not only that she used her vocal phrasing more like that of a muted horn in the manner of Billie Holiday or Dinah Washington. But also in the fact that the improvised flavor of the chord sequences she used told a similar story. But taken by itself the music here is another matter.<br /><br />  In an era where the singles mentality of popular music,abandoned in the 70's was again in full command of the music Erykah Badu's debut is an album first and foremost. There are standout individual songs. But her music is something like an aural casserole. You have a lot of ingredients mixed together. But they compliment eachother to near perfection and it goes down great taking it in. The song \\"On & On\\" is not only a great single moment from this album but gives it a great patter with which to follow. The rhythms,her vocals,the electric pianos and the askew,somewhat jazz phrased melodies all come together to form something very special. And she just keeps variating on that theme with \\"Appletree\\",\\"Sometimes\\",\\"Drama\\" and \\"Otherside Of The Game\\". It's also helpful that she views the romantic matters she sings about here through a very poetic filter,mixing it all up with a conscious and afro bohemian point of view. And often this results in some straight up truths on songs such as \\"Certainly\\" and \\"4 Leaf Clover\\" mix ideas of self awareness and existentialism through her own personal filter. Her sense of storytelling is also important here. While one of the best and most singular tunes here is a \\"skit\\" called \\"Afro\\",which brings her humor and an even more jazzy sound to the mix.<br /><br />  Erykah Badu's music isn't something that you may fully comprehend the first time you heart it. It's definitely music that has a flow to it. The sound of it,Badu's vocals and lyrics-the manner in which they kind of slip along the musical bed rather than dance upon it. It's like one basic idea expanded upon for 14 separate songs that are...disconnected segments of one whole. The first time I heard it was in a car trip around dusk and it seemed to fit the mood of that time and type of motion perfectly. She has a quiet sound to her voice. On the other hand she takes very unpredictable turns of phrase with it as well. It wouldn't be a misstep to see her as something of a jazzy singer more than a contemporary soul/R&B one. There's also an influence of hip-hop in her approach. But definitely not of the stereotypical variety. And it definitely did fill the void whether it was trying to. It clearly comes from the D'Angelo school to some degree. On the other hand the sound is very stripped down here. Another key factor. All good things....don't last forever. They change. Or in the case of Erykah Badu they become somewhat less significant once they begin to influence other artists. But here it was a revelation. And it holds up very well today.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|There are bad albums, medium albums, albums that take a while to get used to and enjoy.  Then are albums that are great right off the bat.  Wasting light (for me) is one of those albums. From start to finish every track has something to offer. Great guitar riffs, moving lyrics, and some great screaming from dave. This is one that very quickly moved to the top of the pile! Way to go.

B004LWZW4W|5.0|If you are a fan from the old movies, not the newer Mark Wallburg remake, then you will love this movie. It is riddled with Easter eggs from almost all of the old movies.      This movie is very well done. The story makes sense, chronologically, its believable, and you begin to care about all the characters involved. If this is to be considered a prequel to the \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" then this is that movie. Again the scientific research, data, techniques, and procedures that we do on animals, particularly prime apes, gives it a sense of realism to our world and time era.  They also open the door for a future movie by adding another Easter egg.   I also want everyone to know, My Wife said she would not watch this movie. I made her and she loved it. She never watched any of the other movies and thought it would be a King Kong knock off. By the middle of the movie she was connected to the characters and wanted to know how things would play out. ANYONE will like this move, even if you think everything sucks.  Rent it if you have your doubts. You will love it, trust the random internet person.   ENJOY!

B005OCFHHK|2.0|I don't need to talk about the movies. But the packaging was disappointing, to say the least.  They didn't even print new labels for the disks! It's like \\"Harry Potter and the (whatever), Disk 1\\". What do you mean, Disk 1? It's only 1 disk per movie!!  So this obviously means they just got all the individual movies that didn't sell, threw the \\"Extras\\" disk away and put them into this 8-disk package.  I bought this because I still have the \\"years 1-5\\" DVD box, so I just replaced the DVDs with the blu-rays.  But this is not the box to buy if you want a \\"Complete Film Collection\\", despite of what the product name and description says...  []'s

0061122416|1.0|I honestly don't understand why this book is so popular. It seems like it's been over-hyped that now loving it has become a brand of cool.  I didn't love it. I didn't even like it that much. It made me go meh and I kept checking to see how many pages I had left. The main character, Santiago, didn't feel like a real person. He was merely a symbol of the common man who became in touch with his inner feelings and follows his dream. Yep, that's what the plot is about: following your dreams and being in harmony with your feelings and the world. It all just felt like a long anecdote that a motivational speaker in high school would tell.  I was bored reading this the entire time.  I'm not saying that the lessons aren't good and it's not going to change someone's life and blah, blah, blah. I'm just saying that the simple writing style mirrored an over simplified plot with cardboard cutout characters repeating over and over again some kitschy and cliched \\"inspirational\\" truths.

0061730335|3.0|William Kamkwamba's memoir tells the story of his life growing up in a poor African farming village in Malawi. Without running water or electricity, William and his family live a life of subsistence dependent upon the success of their annual maize crop. Raised in a culture entrenched in mysticism and superstition, William--who must repeatedly drop out of school because his family is too poor to pay for his tuition and fees--becomes curious about science. A chance encounter with a bicycle dynamo sparks his interest in electricity, and soon he is scavenging his village for any available resource that will help him build his inventions. While exiled from school, William spends a great deal of time in a village library, where he devours books on physics and mechanics, and--with the help of his friends--he builds a working windmill that supplies him and his family with electricity. This book, however, tells more than just the story of how William \\"harnessed the wind\\"; it also tells of the abject poverty that is rampant throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa, the sickness its people endure (malaria chief among them), and the corrupt politics that dominate many African governments. Through all these hardships, William endures, persists, never abandons his goals. His story is, quite simply, an inspiration.

1844137872|5.0|This book is funny, provocative and at times, borders on anarchy.  As Banksy himself states, you will love him, hate him or you won't really care.  So, how you feel about this book will be very personal.  Does it speak to you, or not?  It did speak to me.  I don't hold Banksy on a pedestal as some do, but I appreciate what he is creating.  Art that challenges us.  \\"What we need in this race is a lot more streakers.\\"  Or maybe just more provocative graffiti writers.  Banksy is clever (probably too clever for his own good.)  He is an artist in every sense of the word, creating pieces but also thinking and stretching boundaries.  I particularly like that he doesn't take himself too seriously, readily admitting that the depth someone else saw in his work wasn't actually what he intended or that a group of \\"revolutionaries\\" robbing a cell phone store made his Che Guevara piece a little ironic . . . \\"Why would someone paint pictures of a revolutionary when you can actually behave like one instead?\\"  I like that he admits that even the people he's writing for (specifically those behind the wall in Palestine) don't welcome his work.    At the same time there still seems to be an arrogance in Banksy, his view of the world being above reproach.  I may not agree with everything he preaches but I do like that he challenges everything we hold dear about society, because a complacent society is a dangerous place.  His work can make you think and challenge your complacency, if you let it.  He goes straight to the heart of our societal problems (money, war, obesity, consumerism & capitalism as the highest good, class inequity and the unequal distribution of food, water and wealth in the world) and makes these issues funny and frequently uncomfortable.    He pushes art for the people pointing out something that I'd never really thought about before.  \\"We the people, affect the making and the quality of most of our culture, but not our art . . . The Art we look at is made by only a select few.  A small group create, promote, purchase, exhibit, and decide the success of Art . . . When you go to an Art gallery you are simply a tourist looking at the trophy cabinet of a few millionaires.\\"  It makes me wonder how Banksy feels about his fame, wealth and celebrity followers.  I'd like to believe he simply doesn't care.  The art makes me laugh and evokes strong emotional responses as I look at it.  I wish I owned this book so I could look at it again and again.  But, having said all of this, I still wouldn't want my son to grow up to be a graffiti writer.  But, I don't want him to grow up to be an advertising executive either.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|The alien invasion theme is always good for a sci-fi action movie and I've enjoyed them all. \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" pulls a little from several of them and puts it together in a reasonably satisfying mix; it is loud, fast paced and has a really lot of shooting.<br /><br />Fortunately for the good guys the aliens lack one important defense that made the enemy in ID4 a lot harder to defeat. I'll go no further there to avoid a spoiler; let it suffice that the good guys, played by a platoon of Marines, win the day and save the earth.<br /><br />This one will not please those inclined toward romantic flicks, but should entertain most guys that appreciate sci-fi action movies.

B0000C03AH|5.0|I'm reworking my original review for this outstanding cycle in light of it's reincarnation on SACD. It's an easy pick for the best intepretations of these symphonies available in the Super Audio format. The sound quality is not as high end as some of the finest digital cycles on SACD but the performances beat them all to hell. My original review was for the Original Image-Bit Processing that DG did back in 1997 for the Complete Beethoven Edition. That version of this awesome cycle has been long out of print and it's nice to have a sonic upgrade here.  The strings are sweeter, the brass more burnished. The bass is not as boomy as before. The sound has great impact and the stereo acoustics of the church where these recordings were made is still fantastic. The chorus in the 9th's finale sounds better but overall maintains the sonic problems of the time. The chorus is large and kind of back placed. It's definitely clearer than before but not the miracle one would hope for. Overall I would say very well done on the sound part. As for the performances, here are the contents of my original review. My thoughts on Karajan's famous early 60s Beethoven cycle...  This is Karajan at his absolute best, the orchestra and conductor seem to be a world removed from lesser conductors and ensembles. The Berlin Philharmonic has a real air of swaggering confidence in these recordings and Karajan seems to be on a mission to make a lasting impression, which he does! The exceptional rhythmic drive, the unbelievable intergrity of ensemble have to be heard to be believed.  The cycle I'm reviewing is like I said, the first of 3 DG cycles, the old mono EMI set is not competitive with the 3 DG cycles. So what distinguishes this first DG set from the other Karajan cycles, not to mention the dozens of cycles by other conductors?   SYMPHONY 1 is played just like mature Beethoven, not second hand Mozart or Haydn. You relish hearing this symphony played in the grand manner with complete conviction asopposed to the typical quasi-period fashion that is considered good manners today! Forget good manners, I want a great performance! Karajan does that but I would have liked a slightly slower tempo in the andante movement.   SYMPHONY 2 is one of the best you'll ever hear. It has everything, power, vigor, just hear the BPO go for the gusto in the codas to the outer movements, no one else can duplicate that! So intoxicating. The larghetto is wonderful too, even though I have heard more loving portrayals of this movement. But you really get the sense of joy that the musicians have in this music and is that perhaps Karajan moaning in pleasure? If you listen on headphones really closely, it's possible to hear the typically stone-faced authoritarian conductor elicit moans of pleasure from the music that his orchestra is creating before his ears.   SYMPHONY 3, this Eroica is one for the ages. With the opening movement taking flight you know this is going to be great. Karajan certainly looks back to the bold and dramatic Toscanini performances of old but what Karajan brings to the interpretation is that beauty of sound typically associated with him. It is not a hinderance at all, the whole work sounds suave, dark, cool and mysterious. The funeral march is great, all 17 minutes of it, Karajan's longest take and it is involving every step of the way. The scherzo and finale are also bubbling with life and total commitment. As good as this Eroica is though, I still would have to nominate Karajan's final digital Eroica from the 1980's on the \\"Karajan Gold\\" label as being the conductor's best. The first movement on that \\"Karajan Gold\\" Eroica is faster and more explosive while the funeral march, although faster and less mysterious compensates in it's sheer power with high-intensity dramatic contrasts.   SYMPHONY 4 is one Karajan never did better than in this 1960's set although some would say it was matched by a later digital record. I can't complain about a single thing here except Karajan's continual insistence to drop the final movement's exposition repeat. Speaking of repeats, yes I know Karajan drops most of Beethoven's repeats which is fine by me except in some cases. He keeps the repeats in the opening movements of Symphonies 1, 5 and 8. He also repeats the exposition in the finale of Symphony 1. Basically he keeps in line with his conducting generation on this matter, which is fine by me. Even with that thought, the short and sweet extra exposition run-through in the final movement of Symphony 4 he should have kept too!   SYMPHONY 5, wow this is a keeper! It is one of the most intense 5ths ever recorded. The opening movement is terrifying, forget about Carlos Kleiber! After the grim and powerful opening, Karajan gives his most loving and spacious account of the andante before moving into a precise, impactful scherzo which leads inevitably into the imposing finale. The brass are magnificent throughout this finale and near the end of the recapitulation there is a massive crash, a huge wall of sound that will pin you back to your seat! That's only if you are in a seat, you might be jumping in the air, waving your invisible baton with a serious case of conductor envy! This is a really macho performance, Karajan delivers one of the best 5ths of all time.   SYMPHONY 6, the Pastoral is smooth-sailing or rather it is smooth-sailing where smooth-sailing is not wanted. The first 2 movements are too fast and too slick. The scherzo of the peasants is done very well, with plenty of unbridled energy but it lacks a crucial repeat which makes this movement incomplete. The storm is ultra dramatic in the best Karajan tradition, you gotta love it. The finale sails along with astounding beauty and grace, so basically the performance has it's faults but also some merits and the Berlin Philharmonic are on their toes throughout. I saw Karajan's filmed version of the Pastoral on DVD directed by Hugo Niebeling and Karajan has a smile on his face almost the whole time. It's no doubt he loved this music, I just wish his first movement was not as hectic and I wish he kept the repeat in the scherzo. Karajan did later keep the repeat in his 1970's version, but then dropped it again for the digital 1980's version which is his worst Pastoral of all.   SYMPHONY 7, contagious energy and optimism are the hallmarks of this performance. Karajan always conducted in the Toscanini trend of the fast flowing tempo in the allegretto, which bugs me because at a slower speed like that of Furtwangler the allegretto is much more communicative spiritually. In the allegro con brio finale Karajan is barely matched by anyone, he drives the orchestra like a rollercoaster, just the way it should be! Nothing but greatness.   SYMPHONY 8 is a fantastic performance, however I still prefer the later digital \\"Karajan Gold\\" 8th over this one. There is nothing remotely wrong with this one, just that the later version sounds even more intense and has digital sound.   SYMPHONY 9, there is still plenty of controversy to go around about which Karajan Ninth is his best. I think this is Karajan's finest version even if it's miles away from the heaven storming spirituality of Furtwangler. Karajan clearly favors Toscanini, so did Szell for instance but whereas Szell can seem cold at times, Karajan is always on fire here. The adagio is more spacious in the 1970's version and that version has a truly volcanic conclusion in the finale's coda.   Upon further listening I have come to the realization that the Ninth included in this set is clearly superior to Karajan's later 1977 Ninth. The sound is much more vibrant in the Ninth here in 1962, Karajan is more alive and committed while the singers are far more impressive. Karajan also repeats the first section of the scherzo, something that he didn't do in his later remakes of this symphony. So definitely this 1962 account is superior to the 1977 version and the 1980s version as well, because the 1980s recording lacks the amazing singers that Karajan has here. As far as the Eroica is concerned, my allegiance still lies with the digital Karajan Gold version from the 1980s.   No matter, if you buy this set, you'll still get one of the better Ninths around even though Furtwangler's conception of this music will forever be superior to Karajan's in my mind and in the minds of many music lovers.   In conclusion, this cycle, with it's remastered sound, is the clearest investment if you are looking for a complete set of Beethoven's immortal symphonies. Karajan's digital Eroica is better in my opinion. Also, you might want to get Bruno Walter or Giulini's version of the Pastoral. If you want more great Ninths, check out Furtwangler in 1942 on Music and Arts and on EMI in 1951. For something more modern, Solti on Decca in 1972. Have fun shopping!
B005OK722U|4.0|\\"Place your bets\\" When a group of friends decide to have their bachelor party in Vegas they get more then the expected. For those that have seen the other two in the series you will pretty much know what to expect from this one. This one did have a different aspect to it that made it a little more twisted. An eBay type auction is set up with a picture of the person and the bidders are allowed to to it over their phones. Instead of doing the killing in a old warehouse this one is in a sophisticated room with glass where people can sit and watch (and order food and drinks). While the \\"Dr.\\" is working people are allowed to place bets on different aspects of the \\"performance\\" such as how long until the victim brings up his kids. While this is about the same level of gore as the other two this one is a little more disturbing based on the fact that the killings were more like a reality show then for \\"fun\\". I will say that even though this is a different crew then the others it is not a huge drop off in quality. Overall, if you liked the others you will like this one. I give it a B.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|King's written so many books. Many good, many not-so good. This is one of the latter unfortunately. I like his work best when he sticks with horror or dark fantasy.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I looked really hard for a case that would protect my phone from drops and also look nice. I didn't like the colored versions of the bumpers I saw, and wanted to protect the glass back. This case is AWESOME. You may or may not like the circles on the back, but I love them. I love that it's completely clear, and easy access to all the buttons (and nothing to get in the way of adapters or chargers on the connector). It's rubber, but feels very hard like almost a hard plastic. But it has enough give to absorb a lot of bumps. I haven't dropped the phone yet, but I feel a lot safer with this case on it! This case is worth way more than $8.99 and beat out the other case I bought for over $25! LOVE THIS CASE :)

0812548094|5.0|Second in the Sword of Truth fantasy adventure series (you may know it by its television series name, [[ASIN:B002GY9F9K Legend of the Seeker: The Complete First Season]]).<br /><br />My Take<br />It's one of those epic stories...979 pages is pretty epic! And, fortunately, Goodkind covers so much ground and we get a big chunk of resolution. Of course, he does set us up with two new challenges for future installments. I know it will be worth it though as Goodkind has created a huge cast of amazing characters with a wide range of values from truly evil to incredibly good and all the human foibles in between. Even if it is a bit callow in its presentation. There is a naive simplicity to sentence construction; too abrupt in its transitions. Still it is a story I could not put down. It took all night and I still had to read a bit of another book to bring my heart rate down!<br /><br />The basic fight is between Additive and Subtractive magic with the Additive used by living magic users and Subtractive by the Keeper and dead magic users. Extremely rarely, one person may use both. In Stone of Tears, it's up to Richard to repair the torn Veil that prevents the underworld from entering the world of the living, to prevent the Keeper from emerging and destroying all life. In his zeal, Richard simply makes things worse and worse.<br /><br />It's fascinating to watch Richard change the perspective of those around him. He learns so much on this journey of his as do those who come into contact with him.<br /><br />Reading of the tactics of a woefully outnumbered force of 4,500 children against 50,000+ hardened warriors is an absolute treat--I cheered as I read!<br /><br />The Story<br />A series of events have triggered Richard's magic and the headaches he suffers are increasingly debilitating. The Sisters of the Light tell him that he will die very soon unless he submits to the Rada'Han, a collar of control. After his experiences with such a collar under Denna's tutelage, Richard will never accept it. Until Kahlan orders him to. A betrayal of such depth and anguish for both.<br /><br />But Denna's lessons stand Richard in good stead when he is on the road with Sister Verna and he slowly converts her to his ways including changing her attitudes about horses. On their journey, he acquires an unexpected companion and sets the conditions for several prophecies to be fulfilled. You'll love the commotion he creates once he does reach the Palace of the Prophets! Not to be missed!!<br /><br />Kahlan's journey is much more fraught. To escape notice, she leaves the Mud People with only three men. And those three learn a great deal about the world: its size as well as its cruelties. They also learn Kahlan's true role in the world. The cruelest is the massacre and destruction of Ebinissia while the most illuminating is the revenge and betrayal in the mountain pass. However, that is not the last betrayal Kahlan suffers or in which Chandalen aids her.<br /><br />Meanwhile Zedd and Adie have their own set of life-threatening adventures however minor their appearance in the story.<br /><br />The Characters<br />There is a cast of thousands, almost literally, so I'm simply going to list the more important.<br /><br />Kahlan Amnell is the Mother Confessor, the head of the Central Council of the Midlands in Aydindril that orders Kings and Queens, vetoes their actions, keeps the peace. It is her responsibility to represent the interests of everyone and every country but especially those who have no representation on the Council. Queen Cyrilla of Galea is Kahlan's unacknowledged half-sister. Captain Bradley Ryan is the commander of what remains of the Galean Army. A child. But a child bent on destroying the Army of the Imperial Order which destroyed his home city of Ebinissia.<br /><br />Richard Cypher has just learned that George Cypher was not his father. Instead, the tyrant he just killed was his true father, Darken Rahl. Richard is the new Lord Rahl of D'Hara. The man who raped his mother, Zedd's daughter. His actions in [[ASIN:0765362643 Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, 1)]] have set tripped his magic and he will die unless he receives training in his magic.<br /><br />Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander is the First Wizard. The most powerful mage in their world. He is also Richard's grandfather and he needs the help of Adie, a sorceress who lives in the Boundary to help Richard repair the Veil. Lady Jebra Bevinvier is a servant whom Zedd rescued in D'Hara whom he has sent on her own journey to use her visions to aid the Midlands.<br /><br />Sisters of the Light are a rigid religious group who believe they are justified in doing anything to train the men who have magic. They're bad enough but there are also the Sisters of the Dark some of whom set sail from. Like Denna, they also use a collar to control their charges. Sister Ann is the Prelate; Nathan is the Prophet who has quite a few enlightening facts for Richard. Pasha Maes is a novice promised the charge of training Richard.

0062011847|1.0|Yes, I too am a Terry Pratchett fan.  I think I am the number 1 fan, as many others might think.  I have not only read I Shall Wear Midnight, I liked it, although it was a bit dark.  Terry, please please please stop writing about Vimes.  We dont like him.  This is the worst of your books I have read (or tried to).  The other was Monstrous Regiment, which I could not finish.    I now think that Terry did not write this book.  Or he did not write it alone.  Or something.  Its true what others say, it was not funny AT ALL.  Half way in I was not sure what was actually going on.  The goblins are horrible and you struggle to support their plight. I just could not connect with anyone in this book.  It has the feel throughout of a nightmare.  Please make it stop.  I compulsively read Thief of Time (my hardcover is falling appart), and Going Postal and Making Money, probably my top three favorates.  Then Jingo too.    What happened to Susan and her chocolate habbit?  And Lobsang?  Where is Moist, I thought he was going to become Mr Tax?  I even miss Death and the Rat and Raven.  And what of the bumbling wizzard, Rincewind, where be he?  If I was your advisor, I would tell you to find yourself, or forget yourself, just find your sense of humour. I will read anything, even Vimes (shudder) if its funny.    Write something about the end of the world, that should be a laugh.  2012 and all that.    If it keeps going like this I am going to be forced to write my own stories.  Do authors find their own work funny?  I would also like to have read a book about Igor, the one working for Jeremy in Thief of Time.  He was fun, I liked him.  Where is he now?  So many places to go, no need to Vimes it anymore.  Please.  Whoever is helping you now, fire them. Today.  You know, I even read the unadulterated cat.  I dont like cats, I am allergic to them.  But you wrote it, so I read it.  What about Masklin?  Its been so long, did you write him?  How about the adventures of the Swan?    If youneed ideas, call me.  :-)
0525423656|2.0|Psst...Stephanie. Wake up, it's over.<br /><br />Oh, man. Did I fall asleep again? It's not my fault. Really, it isn't. If only Crossed had just a little bit more action and a lot less poetry, it would have been able to keep my attention focused on reading the book instead of hitting my REM cycle. That's not to say I didn't entirely enjoy Crossed, but it also didn't live up to my expectations.<br /><br />Crossed picks up where Matched left off. Ky had been sent away to the Outer Provinces and Cassia is currently residing in a girl's work camp. In this installment she travels to the Outer Provinces to find Ky, while he somehow escapes the Outer Provinces to be reunited with Cassia back in the Society. A few new discoveries are made regarding the Society and an apparent rebellion called the Rising. Along the way, enough poetry to give Maya Angelou a headache is recited and flashbacks to Ky's past are also included.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this book mostly because I did enjoy Matched. I enjoyed the \\"Do not go gently\\" theme and Condie's poetic writing style. But for some reason it just didn't work out too well for me in Crossed. I liked how the PoVs switched back and forth between Ky and Cassia. In fact, I am a fan of that particular style, when done correctly. However, in this case I found it difficult to tell who was who. Cassia and Ky's voice sounded exactly alike to me. I found myself flipping back to the beginning of the chapters to confirm who was narrating. Because of this I slowly felt myself becoming disconnected from the characters even with learning further details about Ky's past.<br /><br />The Characters:<br />One thing I did enjoy about the book were the introduction of the minor characters. While traveling to the Outer Provinces to find Ky, Cassia teams up with a girl named Indie. At first I really liked Indie because she was brave, sharp, and determined. But around 77% of the book she seemed too sneaky to me and I didn't appreciate her lying to Cassia about the Rising.<br /><br />She also steals from Cassia and Cassia has the nerve to ask, \\"What else has she been hiding? Does she even think we are friends?\\" Umm...Cassia? Someone who steals and lies is not a friend. I do think she created an interesting dynamic to the story, but I'm not entirely sure I liked her as a character.<br /><br />Ky also travels with two other companions: a boy named Eli who reminds him of Bram (Cassia's younger brother) and Vick. I actually liked both of those new characters very much. In fact, they were my saving grace for this book. To me they seemed to be the only two characters that actually expressed realistic reactions to things. Eli asks questions that should be asked and Vick gets angry when everyone else is maintaining unrealistic calmed facade.<br /><br />Cassia and Ky irritated me to no end, especially Ky. He knew about the Rising since Matched and never told Cassia. I was willing to accept that until he continued to try and hide his knowledge after their reunion. He was extremely selfish in this book. Not only that, but his explanation as to why he didn't want to join the Rising didn't make much sense to me and it ultimately almost breaks them up. After they have traveled all that time endangering their lives, they almost throw it completely away. Unbelievable. Cassia is no better because she waits until the last possible moment to confront Indie and Ky. Great. Just great. Another complacent heroine.<br /><br />Condie does manage to keep Xander in the picture despite his small page time. Both Cassia and Ky think of him often and have flashbacks involving him. And it also appears that a love-square may be forming. Yes, feel free to ]insert eye rolling here[.<br /><br />The Prose:<br />There are a few quotes that I really loved in Crossed. Like this one:<br />Everyone has something of beauty about them. In the beginning for me, it was Ky's eyes I noticed, and I love them still. But loving lets you look, and look, and look again. You notice the back of a hand, the turn of a head, the way of a walk. When you first love, you look blind and you see it all as the glorious, beloved whole, or a beautiful sum of beautiful parts. But when you see the one you love as pieces, as whys--why he walks like this, why he closes his eyes like that--you can love those parts, too, and it's a love at once more complicated and more complete.<br /> I think Condie is gifted with writing some truly beautiful passages. However, when the entire book is filled with your characters sitting on rocks reciting poetry every few pages, my patience tends to fly out the window. One minute I'm reading Crossed and the next minute I'm:<br /><br />A) Falling asleep<br /><br />Or<br /><br />B) Getting distracted by squirrels<br /><br />I'm not even sure where the climax was because I was just that bored with the plot, characters, everything. It was like watching the Peanut gang's parents go, \\"Blah, blah, blah, blah.\\" LOL. Maybe I fell asleep at that part. It really wouldn't surprise me if that were the case.<br /><br />The World Building:<br />I was hoping to see more world building in this installment, but I was once again left with many unanswered questions. Who runs the Society? How are these rebels slipping in and out of the Society if the Society has such a strict eye on things? Who put Ky's name into the Matching pool? Where are all the Provinces located? Several are mentioned in the book, but I have no idea where they are located. I feel this series could really use a world map. Speaking of the world, is the Society located over the entire world? The way it is described seems like it's only in one part of the world. What in the world is the Warming? It's mentioned in Crossed, but it's not really explained well. Are there no gay society members? So many questions, so little time, and so little cares of mine to give. I hope these questions will be answered in final book, but at this point I won't hold my breath.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to strong supporters and fans of Matched. If you felt Matched was just an \\"ok\\" read for you, chances are you will be disappointed with its sequel Crossed.<br /><br />Poetry inspired by Crossed!<br /><br />Roses are red<br />Violets are blue<br />This book may bore you<br />And put you to sleep too!<br /><br />More of my reviews and other random things at my blog [...]walk.

B003W5C0VW|5.0|The rolling Stones at their absolute live peak here in 1972.Playing with so much energy that they can barely contain themselves.On this tour, and in this particular show they got down what they started back in the 1969 tour when Mick Tayler replaced Brian Jones as the 2nd guitarist.And that was to play pure high energy,sraight out ROCK AND ROLL,like Chuck Berry on Steroids.    They only went down hill from here,especially live. This is the stuff,the reason they were called \\"The Worlds Greatest Rock and Roll Band.\\"    They played live for another 35yrs since this show, and were filmed on many tours, and you can see as the years and tours go by how the pure essence of the Rolling Stones music took a back seat to larger stages,less real playing by the group, and more and more backround singers and musicians,clogging up the stage and sound.you can actually see this progressivly happening from tour to tour,year to year.    So what are the Stones? The Greatest rock and roll band in the world.(FROM 1963 to 1972.And thank God for Video tape.    Mick Tayler and Keith play their asses off here.Charlie Watts never drummed better.Every single song is played to the max with so much energy that it seems like its got to fall apart.But it never does.    This cleaned up dvd looks and sounds better than ever.There's bonus footage of rehearsels,interviews and songs.    Get this dvd and see why they WERE the Greatest Rock and Roll Band.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I had doubts wading thru the first few chapters since it's been a while since I've dared take on something this lengthy and complex, but it soon grabbed me and I couldn't stop reading. Fans of Hobbits and unicorns may find the grit and violence too disturbing, but I welcome the realism.<br /><br />The world-building intrigued me, but GRRM doesn't spend a lot of time elaborating on it. Some of his character and place names seemed unimaginative and derivative, and others way too similar (e.g., Arrya/Arys).<br /><br />Matters are not helped by the incompetent editing and profusion of typos in the Kindle version. \\"i£,\\" should you encounter it, is 'if' and 'Your' is frequently rendered as 'Tour.' You can probably figure out that 'sells word' is 'sellsword' but you shouldn't have to. A few sentences and paragraphs just stop; italics and hyphens appear at random. These errors were distracting and are not present in the paper version, so apparently at some point the publisher had someone who knew how to proofread and edit. Considering how much time I invested in this, I'd have been better off reading my used paperback copy and ditching the Kindle. The good news is that they don't charge extra for the errors, you pay the same price as the paperback.<br /><br />I'm giving it five stars because GRRM shouldn't be punished for the incompetence of his editors.

B005CRQ2IU|1.0|I don't think it's the file that's corrupted, but my kindle fire simply won't read it.  It displays a blank white page with the book title and page number at the top left.  That's it.  If I restore the entire device to factory defaults (and lose browser bookmarks, locally stored text files, all game saves) my kindle reads the file beautifully...for a week or so.  Then out of the blue one day, it simply ceases to read the file.  Re-downloading it won't clear it up.<br /><br />To their credit, amazon has refunded my money for the graphic novels I bought and for now, I'm working with customer service to try to figure out what could be wrong with my kindle.  My biggest concern is that as the KF8/HTML5 format takes off, I may end up with quite a few books that my unit can't display.

B001FB55I0|3.0|I wasn't blown away by this installment of the Terminator series, but there was a lot to enjoy from the dirty visuals to the clever use of the original terminator body etc.<br /><br />The Director's cut however was COMPLETELY unnecessary to release. It's only about 3 mins longer which is made up (from what I noticed) of a couple partial nudity shots in the early middle of the film and a fleeting redundant mention of Conner's mom in a speech he gives over a radio towards the end which I think was added in this version. Really not worth seeing at all. Adds nothing but a small additional length. It did make me laugh though - the conversation that may have lead to re-incorporating the topless bit for the director's cut:<br /><br />Producer: \\"Why are we re-adding this topless shot again?\\"<br />Director: \\"DUDE - the audience just isn't going to buy that she'd want to save him later in the film unless we add this back in.

B005UG542S|1.0|I feel like I have to read the books because Yates is an AWFUL director, the guy has no business screwing anything beyond his Doctor No series, and how anybody involved in the project was willing to stand behind him after his intial takeover is Rowlings greatest folly, and a stain on a series that could've easily been a star better every movie he was involved in.    I am CRITICAL, and let's just say all of his work is amateurish at best to anything Peter Jackman has ever worked on, and his hyperconcentration on lighting, scene, and tackiness of needing everything to tightly fit hit its final note in these last 2 movies, making each character more of a paper cut out devoid of any life, character, and the things one cherished about every character in the 1st movie.  Rowling may have got her financial kicks out of this, but for everyone who actually cares about good writing, cinematography that showcases characters (not buries them or makes it easy to ignore their lack of inspiration), and a complete story that meshes everything into one stupendous fireworks ending, these final movies will put the nail in the coffin, and just plain piss off/depress you if you've actually been buying the blue ray collection of them.  Don't deny it either folks, by the middle of Part 1 you were almost asleep, and by the 1st 10 mins of Part 2 you wouldn't have cared if every character got covered in hot magma and the whole thing was over.  Yates is NOT big skills movie director, should never have been given a shot like this yet again, and I'll skip on the rest of Rowling's future works because letting this kind of MTV Video crapzola to made of your work isn't more than a hop, skip, and a jump from becoming the next Twilight books/movies.  Sad day for Potter fans, I suggest you just stick to the books and settle with the fact that some authors are only in the business to make money, and in Rowlings case to make money off the movies (not me, when I become the next great Epic Fantasy writergone Epic Movie Series, I PROMISE to never let this happen, and shame the Twlights of the world for crapping on the art of storytelling in the name of the $ sign only!).  Thank the Universe there are still some George RR Martins in this world!
0894803123|5.0|OK, so there are enough reviews on this book to give you hours of opinions, BUT, I am holding this book up against several others to tell my perspective.  When I bought my Cuisinart ice cream machine, I researched all the ice cream books, and ended up with four, Ben & Jerry's, and 3 others. After browsing the Ben & Jerry book, I had a few concerns, like uncooked eggs. It was also missing most of the typical Ben & Jerry flavors. I started out with the other books, and found myself scratching my head over some of the vague instructions, including obtuse measurements like \\"2 large peaches.\\" Some recipes require a large number of cooking steps and processes, adding more ambiguity, such as \\"medium heat,\\" or \\"4 or 5 minutes.\\"  As time marched on, I discovered that EVERY recipe from Ben & Jerry's was a success, while most of the others were either outright failures or disappointments. I believe the cause of this is inadequate testing. That said, I also discovered that you must follow Ben & Jerry's recipes EXACTLY. The Georgia Peach was the best peach ice cream I've ever tasted, but I didn't like the frozen peach chunks, so I tried again, pureeing the peaches. Changed the whole thing, and left me with an off-taste. Next time, I will just chop the pieces smaller. The chocolates are fabulous. The Kiwi Sorbet is fantastic.  Another difference in other books is the desire to provide recipes that can be made any time, hence the use of frozen and/or canned fruits. IMHO, just doesn't work. Another caveat, learning about various ingredients can greatly affect the quality and taste of your ice cream. For example, in my area, you cannot find heavy cream that is not ultrapasteurized, a heating process that changes the consistency and flavor, but adds a substantial amount of time to the shelf life. It also invites the addition of chemicals to re-thicken the cream, one being carragenan, which those of us with a sensitivity to MSG cannot tolerate. So, I buy my ingredients carefully. Forexample, Trader Joe's has two brands of unadulterated cream.  The bottom line: If you don't like using raw eggs, skip this book, but if you want simple, great tasting ice cream at home, snap this one up.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The first two books each left me in awe, the last one left me saying why!!!!  It immediatly prompted me to purchase this one, the last and final book in the Hunger Games.  This is obviously not a fairy tale, a happily ever after where the characters survive (at least the ones we love) and live happily ever after.  No this is not that kind of book.  It makes you fully understand what war and rebellion against cruelty means.  Though it is fiction throughout the book you will catch many colorful, tragic views of the effects of war, and the cost of taking a stand.  Katniss becomes very real.  Her emotions are very raw, from deep pain from so much loss, to anger, to even going crazy and finally overcomming (but not completely) the choices that have been made for her and by her.  In this book when she finally realized that she loves Peeta (though she never comes out and says it) she is faced with yet another challenge...President Snow of the Capital has hijaked his memory of her, replacing them with fabricated memories that paint Katniss as evil, as the enemy.  In the end the most tragic thing happens, in the first book Katniss took her sister's Prim's place in the Hunger Games, everything that has been done began with this act of sacrifice for the sister she loves... and in this final book my heart broke because it seemed it was all for nothing, but again this is truth weaved into fiction... real life doesn't always have happy endings.  Still, this book shows to me that even out of tragedic glimmers of hope can and will emerge if we wait another day, and another and another..  I loved this so much I highly reccommend it, and I really wish there was more (yet Suzanne finished this series at just the right spot).

B005LL4U54|4.0|Score has always been the one constant through narrative filmmaking. If modern day films share one major aspect with the silent film era (besides storytelling) it's musical score. Before filmmakers had the ability to record dialogue and sound effects they relied on live music played by a piano player inside the theater for every show. Then finally when sound could be recorded onto film music was the first thing. It's just a natural storytelling device, and to this day remains the most important aspect of filmmaking. So, what would you say if there was a silent film released in 2011? For The Artist we do indeed have a silent film made in 2011, and just like when film started out we have score front and center.<br /><br />Ludovic Bource's score is a stunning reminder of how score functioned when it was the only sound the audience would here. The vital importance of this music is so unique when compared to other films today. The score on this album works hand in hand with the actors to tell every bit of the story, and what a fabulous experience it is. The music moves up and down and you can almost visualize movement because of how structured to the story it is. The score as a whole is rich and full of different sections of emotions. The characters shine through as the score defines every bit of the characters. While the score has certain genre tendencies it definitely doesn't feel like something composed back in the 30's or 40's. It does have a lot of musical stylings that represent the time period of the story, but it's no different than a modern day composer incorporating setting and atmosphere into a score. Just because the music has a 1930's feel doesn't mean the score is trying to be a score from that era. This is indeed a modern silent film score and a beautiful one at that.<br /><br />It's very rare to get to experience something like this. If you wanted to you could listen to the score separately and then see the film and how it molds to the picture. Sure you can go back and watch some great Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin but having an original recording of a silent film score separate for release is a unique experience. I highly recommend everyone take a listen to Bource's magnificent work.some great Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin but having an original recording of a silent film score separate for release is a unique experience.

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|When American filmmakers decided to put forth a second adaptation of the Swedish vampire/drama/horror film, \\"Let the Right One In\\", a mere two years after the first one had been released in Sweden, I was pretty angry. Like many other geeks who'd seen the original adaptation of the Swedish novel, I thought that not enough time had passed(2 years)since the release of the first film, and that there was certainly no justification for the second adaptation. Additionally, the Swedish \\"Let the Right One In\\" adaptation was an unbelievably well made film(a classic in my opinion)and I believed that an attempt at an American adaptation so soon after the advent of the original film was somewhat disrespectful. \\"At least allow the original film to occupy its place in the horror pantheon for at least a few years before some hack director is given permission to besmirch the legacy of the first film with his/her adaptation,\\" is what I'd said to myself after becoming privy to the announcement of the new film.<br /><br />After initially vowing never to see the American adaptation of \\"Let the Right One In\\", the relentless positive buzz that preceded the film's release date led to a change of heart. Immediately after watching the American adaptation I thought \\"Wow. I am so glad that I decided to watch this movie.\\" The American adaptation was different from the Swedish adaptation in many ways.  In fact, the American film had some good qualities that did not exist in the Swedish version. That said, I enjoyed both movies immensely. Each movie appealed to a distinct part of my whole personality, thereby engendering a richer experience for me. Most of the professional critics would probably agree.<br /><br />Fast forward to December 21, 2011, and the movie going public is faced with a similar phenomenon. In 2009, a Swedish adaptation of the Stieg Larson novel, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", was released to critical and box office acclaim in Sweden. It was then transferred to the United States for limited release.  The film became a critical and popular hit in the United States, made a star out of actress Noomi Rapace(who did a great job as the lead) and eventually made an American idol out of the novel's heroine, Lisbeth Salander. Again, a mere two years passes between the release of both films, and thankfully, the film's director is no Bret Ratner.  He is David Fincher, the brilliant auteur who has directed seminal films such as \\"Seven\\", \\"Fight Club\\", and the \\"Social Network\\". With Fincher's name attached to the American Adaptation, it gains instant credibility. However, lovers of the first film are still skeptical. They are afraid that the new version will not live up to the standards of the original adaptation. Well, I'm here to say that the hand wringers can rest easy.  David Fincher's version of  \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is just as good, if not better, than the Swedish original.<br /><br />Many of you who are reading this review are familiar with Stieg Larson's novel. It features a character named Lisbeth Salander, a 24 year old genius computer hacker whose life has been made very difficult because of the psychological/sexual/physical abuse that has been put upon her by male authority figures. Because of this abuse, Lisbeth comes to despise men. That is until she comes into contact with disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, with whom she teams up with to solve the 40 year old \\"murder\\" of Harriet Vagner, a relative of wealthy businessman, Henrik Vagner. As they investigate the disappearance of Harriet, Lisbeth and Mikael become involved in a sexual relationship, where upon Lisbeth develops feelings for the rakish reporter.  They are able to solve the case together even as  the relationship between Mikael and Lisbeth becomes complicated.<br /><br />All of the actors do well for themselves in this movie adaptation, especially actress Rooney Mara, who really gives her all as Lisbeth. Noomi Rapace was great as Lisbeth in the Swedish version of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\". However, Rooney Mara's physical and psychological interpretation of the damaged Lisbeth really grabs you. Anyone who has read the book will tell you that Rooney Mara's Lisbeth fits more with their idealized image of Lisbeth; an emaciated, pale, sexy, and sometimes androgynous girl/woman with a really nasty streak if provoked. Rooney has already been nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance, and is predicted to get more attention during the upcoming awards season.  Daniel Graig is solid as Mikael Blomkvist, and Stellen Skarsgard gives a scary, creepy performance as Martin Vanger. Oh, and special kudos to Yorick Van Waginengen, whose performance as Bjurman(Lisbeth's abusive social worker) really makes you despise his character. You will rejoice when he receives his comeuppance in a brutal scene.<br /><br />David Fincher's version of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" moves much quicker than the Swedish version, even though the film runs almost 3 hours. Everything about Fincher's film is leaner/edgier than the previous version: the lead characters are younger and nastier, the editing is quicker, and the dialog is sharper.  Much more of Stieg Larson's story is told in David Fincher's movie than in the previous version; and this allows the director to really develop the relationship between Lisbeth and Mikael. I also like the tone of this movie. It's a dark, cold and gray movie. I don't think that the sun ever shines in one scene, and given the subject matter of the film(female rape and murder)it would be wrong for the movie to be filmed in any other way besides the dark and gray.<br /><br />So go watch this movie. You'll be sufficiently transfixed by it. And if you haven't seen the Swedish version of the film, watch that too.  They are both wonderful movies, and the positive critical reception is nearly identical for both movies as well. A warning though.

B005ZHB84U|4.0|When we heard Hans' score to the first Sherlock Holmes it wasn't necessarily a game changing score as was Inception or Batman Begins. It was heavily thematic, expertly structured and just a purely fun charismatic ride. It was perfect for the film. Hans isn't new to the sequel world and it's always great to see himself trying new things in familiar territory to try and spice things up. For Holmes' second outing we have a much darker score shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Gone are the bombastic action tracks of the first score as we settle into a foggy maze of shadows.<br /><br />The beginning of the album sets us up with a three part section called \\"Shadows\\". The base of these three tracks is quite brilliant as Hans takes his clock motif from the third act of the first film and turns it into a tensely paced track. Part 2 is entitled \\"Tick Tock\\" and rightfully so as the baseline of the track mimics the ticking of a clock. Then come bursts of strings that build and pull away like waves. As we're stuck in the shadows we are dealt some intense music that just transports us into the universe of this film. After some long tracks we finally emerge from the shadows and are treated to that quirky eccentric theme we love so much. This time around Hans incorporates much more heavily an eastern European sound. Romanian instrumentation is heavily featured such as the obviously titled track \\"Romanian Wind\\". Hans then does some great stuff in tracks like \\"To The Opera\\" and \\"Die Forelle\\" where sound design and score mix together. Diegetic and non-diegetic music become one as Hans incorporates source music into the weave of the score. We also have a great nod to Ennio Morricone with a newly arranged track based off Morricone's Two Mules For Sister Sara. I honestly laughed out loud when I heard it because I didn't look at the tracklisting before I listened to the score. It's one of my favorite Morricone scores, but it's an obscure one and somehow fits perfectly here. We then move toward the conclusion, which isn't as fast paced as the final act of the first film. Hans of course leaves us with Sherlock's theme that undoubtedly plays over the end credits. The final track is actually an incredibly great remix. Hans has built a reputation for including remixes on his CD's (some people hate them), but I actually really love this one as it seems to be done in-house and retains the feel of the score.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows is such an entertaining extension of the first score that you will be trapped in a brilliant world of bizarre textures and expertly structured sequences. It's a ride for sure and one worth taking multiple times. I listened to the score 4 times within the first week because that's how engaging it is. You can't help but be charmed by its seducing mystery, its charismatic cultural infusion and offbeat melodies. Hans and company execute pure entertaining brilliance. It won't make you cry, it's not a game changer, but it's so damn unique that you'll have a grand ol' smirk the entire time you're engrossed in the world.nclusion, which isn't as fast paced as the final act of the first film.

Over all a very good film with great acting all around.

B005IZLPKQ|2.0|This movie has a lot of problems.  SPOILERS.   First of all, the character of Steve Rogers (Captain America) is supposed to be pure of heart, but he comes across as merely childish.  He is innocent to the point of being stupid.  I never got the impression that he was \\"good\\" in the way Superman is good - out of deep moral conviction.  Rather, Rogers was \\"good\\" more like a puppy is good.    Also, many of the plot details were just sort of lame.    Starting from the beginning - Rogers is a runt who becomes a super soldier after being injected with a formula.  However, the scientist who invented the formula is killed, and the formula itself is destroyed immediately after the experiment.  Therefore, the general in charge decides that Rogers would be better off selling war bonds than being a soldier.  Wait... huh?  The general originally wanted an entire army of super soldiers, but now he has only one.  Well, Rogers is still a super soldier, so why not use him for that?  Nope - the general figures he isn't worth it so a politician signs Rogers up to for an acting job with a bunch of showgirls.  Huh?    Moving on... when Rogers goes out on his own to infiltrate the Hydra base, he does so with his Captain America stars and stripes shield strapped to his back.  Huh?  Who tries to sneak into an enemy base with a big `ol America flag hanging off of their back?  That's just dumb.  Did anyone else find the selection of the \\"new\\" shield particularly silly?  Stark (the father of the Stark who is Iron Man) designs several shield designs for Rogers and then gives him a choice.  Rogers looks over the selection on the table, but then notices a circular shield stashed away under the table.  Rogers is like - hey... what's this... I like this one.  Starks response is - oh no... you can't have that one... it is made of a very \\"special\\" metal and that shield represents all that there is in the entire world.  Of course, this is the shield Rogers ends up with.    Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Are you telling me that there are only a few pounds of this \\"special\\" metal and that the best thing the scientists could think up to do with it is to fashion it in the shape of a metal disk?  Also, why the heck was it under the table in the first place?  If it is a shield, then put it on the table for Rogers to pick.  If it is not available, don't hide it under the table.  Or, if you are actually trying to hide it, don't do such a sloppy job of it so that any fool walking by would just see it sticking out.    Anyway - regardless of all this silliness, the nutshell of the plot is that Captain leads American troops to take out a bunch of Hydra bases around Europe.  \\"Hydra\\" is a branch of Nazi Germany - except it isn't... it is really more like Cobra or something.  The leader of Hydra is a dude with a red skull who was the subject of the first super soldier experiment.  The red skull guy comes into possession of an ancient artifact of the gods that provides basically unlimited power to make laser weapons and such.  He intends to use this power to destroy the world - including Nazi Germany.  Why?  Who knows... that really isn't clear - he is just evil.  Go with it.  It also isn't clear how Nazi Germany came up with the funds and resources to build all of these Hydra bases in the first place.    So here we have the basic outlines of the plot.  The good guys go after each base and beat the bad guys who, even though they have great weapons, can't figure out how to shoot straight.    The climax comes when Rogers has to defeat the red skull guy on his stealth bomber of death which is heading toward the US to bomb the whole Eastern coast.  To save the US (and the world I suppose), Rogers decides he must crash the ship in order to stop it... and for some reason he must pilot it all the way into the ground himself.  Uhhhh... why can't he just smash the controls and then fly off the plane in one of the dozens of little bomb jets that are on board?  Why does hehave to go down with it?  Oh wait... that's the only way we can get him to freeze so he can wake up in the future.  This movie wasn't terrible, but it was far from great... or really even good.

B0034G4P80|3.0|I watched Thor and Captain America back-to-back and I think Thor was better.  I'm not saying it was \\"good\\", just better than Captain America.  SPOILERS.    Thor is basically your classic Cain and Abel story.  Odin has two sons... one good and one bad.  Thor and Loki.  One tries to kill the other... you know, the usual stuff.  Does it matter that this is inconsistent with Norse mythology - guess not...  Stick with me here - I expected less from Thor in terms of plot because the entire concept was wrapped up in Norse myth and legend.  On the other hand, Captain America was a story about soldiers in WWII.  Given the context of each story, I'll give Thor a little more wiggle room in terms of plot details making sense or not.  The whole story is more \\"fantasy\\" in the first place.    The only part I found myself really questioning was when Loki travels to Earth to visit Thor while he is being held captive.  How does he do that?  Where does he come from?  Is he Puff the Magic Dragon or something?  Why doesn't anyone see them talking or hear them talking?  How does Loki get back afterward?  One minute \\"Poof\\" he is there... the next \\"Poof\\" he is gone.  Did he use the magic stargate thing?  Obviously not because everyone would notice the giant tornado of clouds and light coming down out of the sky.  Soooooo?????    You know what this sequence reminded me of (of course your do)?  It reminded me of the part in The Matrix when Cifer meets with the agents and plots his betrayal.  Wait - how did Cifer get into the matrix to do that?  Someone has to jack him in.  Someone has to monitor him while he is in the matrix.  Soooo... how does Cifer get in and talk to the agents?  It makes no sense.  He can't.    Same thing here.  Unless Loki got beamed down from the Enterprise, there is no way he could have just appeared and then disappeared.  There is also no way he could have run around the complex without being noticed -  unless he can stop time or something... which he can't... and even if he could he obviously didn't.    Sorry - this stuff just really irritates me.  Hollywood spends million of dollars to make these movies and no one asks these questions?  Are you telling me that none of the producers or actors stopped for a minute and said \\"Hey wait a minute... how does Loki just appear like that?  That doesn't make sense...\\"  Doesn't that happen?  Isn't there someone checking this stuff for consistency?  On the other hand, perhaps the directors, producers, actors, etc just don't care.    I sort of thought the same thing regarding the fact that Loki was really a frost giant baby that was adopted by Odin.  Apparently, Odin can touch frost giant offspring and make them look human?  What?  Is this some sort of Midas touch that turns monsters into Norwegians or something?  So Loki is a frost giant, but doesn't know he is a frost giant, but when he figures out he is a frost giant he suddenly learns to use frost giant powers?  Huh?    Well, the penultimate question here is where is all of this going?  Obviously Thor's Earth woman is going to use her research to recreate the wormhole, right?  I suppose that will happen in the upcoming Avengers movie - guaranteed to be lame btw.    Oh!  Almost forgot!  What's up with the Shrike?  Is that the Shrike running around and blasting people with its face?
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I've been a fan of the Tudor period for many years and approached this series with trepidation.<br />I was hooked in the first five minutes.<br /><br />No, it's not completely accurate - but it never promised to be a documentary. Its only claim was that it would be entertaining and it certainly delivered in that respect: battles, intrigue, murder, torture, love, betrayal and sex. And more sex.<br /><br />If you've ever seen portraits of the various Tudors you'd know they look nothing like the sexed-up versions of the small screen. Henry was apparently the \\"handsomest prince in Christendom\\", which doesn't say much for the rest of them! In reality Henry was a red-headed git, fond of standing with his hands on his hips, legs akimbo - JRM couldn't look lacklustre if he tried - he just oozes sex appeal.<br />Anne was described by the Spanish ambassador as \\"that thin old woman\\" - nothing resembling the gorgeous Natalie Dormer. And the \\"one true wife\\", Jane Seymour, wasn't called \\"plain Jane\\" for nothing!<br />And I've got to say that Charles Brandon never looked so good! Henry Cavall could make a girl swoon - sigh....<br /><br />I fell in love with them all and gleaned a new respect for the most underrated of men, Thomas Cromwell (brilliantly portrayed by Fraine).<br /><br />The acting was first-class all the way, the costumes were sensational and the dialogue was outstanding -  I devoured the whole series like a box of chocolates full of your favourites - I only wish there was more.
0060512806|1.0|Hall of Suck inductee!  Yes my friends, this baby is a colossal disaster.  And I do mean colossal - the length of this book is only trumped by its failure.<br /><br />\\"Craptonomicon\\"... has that been used before?  It really isn't very original.  I'm not even proud of it... I'm not like \\"hee, hee, hee... that's awesome\\" or something.  It is pretty lame actually... and I'm more lame for have written it... or even thought of it for that matter.  Frankly, I just needed a title for this review and it just popped in my head.  Hmmm... sort of like images of the zombie war or baked beans on toast. You know - the kind of beans on toast you might eat in England? You know what?  Someone in London told me once that the reason British fans fight at soccer games is the smell of urine.  Apparently, fans get served fish n' chips wrapped in newspapers.  Then, instead of going to the restroom, they roll up the paper and pee in it... then discard it at their feet.  The theory goes that the scent of all this urine sets off an animal reaction that causes fighting.  So there - now you have something to discuss with your grandparents over dinner.<br /><br />Anyway - The plot isn't even remotely clear until you read about 400 pages.  I kept asking myself, \\"the point is what... the point is what... the point is what?\\"  The book jumped from the past to the present frequently - often with really no clue as to when it was happening.  The book also jumps back and forth between a few different plot lines (which also bounce from past to present) until they finally converge after a mere 700 or 800 pages.<br /><br />I read this dog from front to back.  Not because I wanted to - I came to view it as a challenge.  I refused to let this meandering troll of a novel make me put it down.  \\"You will not defeat me!  You will not defeat me!  You will not defeat meeeeeeeeeeeeee!\\"<br /><br />The sad thing is that I think that there might actually be a good book buried in the depths.  A good editor could perhaps strip 50% of the content out and have something readable.  I mean, do we really need an in-depth description of the Captain Crunch cereal or page after page of mathematical analysis of how often a bike chain will fall off a bike?<br /><br />Frankly, reading this book made me angry.  Unlike some books, which just irritate, annoy, or bore you to death, this book was so poor that it angered me to have wasted my time on it.  In that respect, I'd compare it to watching your favorite football team lose.  Sometimes the team loses and you are just disappointed and maybe annoyed.  Other times, the loss is so ridiculous that you come away angry about it.  That's Cryptonomicon.

B005OOSPZO|4.0|IMO, this is the best movie on Pearl Harbor. It totally blows away the more recent Pear Harbor film with Ben Affleck. They totally screwed that movie up by intertwining it with a flipping soap opera! Sure, the special effects in the battle scenes are great, but it's only half good. The attack on Pearl Harbor should not be romantisized.  I first saw Tora! when I was in the 7th grade many years ago. It was great then and to me it gets better with age.  As far as the Blu-Ray transfer, it is only slightly better than the standard DVD (I have both). The colors are better, but it looks quite grainy and filmy, but for a film from the seventies, it's not bad. I think these studios will throw any old thing on a Blu-Ray disc and call it \\"high definition\\". To do it right, they need to do a \\"4K\\" restoration where they scan each frame and clean it, then digitize it.  The packaging is awesome. The disc jacket is itself a little full color book.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|It should not be necessary to recapitulate the plot, since the novel this movie was based upon was widely read. The eventual outcomes in the lives of Sarah and Julia, whose stories intersect in a single place - an apartment in Paris - can be seen coming from a good distance.<br /><br />This is not so much a straight story, a retelling of a tragedy, and the unraveling of a mystery; rather an account of how we can be haunted - sometimes tragically - by memories of actions done, or left undone, of the unconsidered gesture, the off-hand word and the impulsive action of a moment. Such small words, deeds, gestures can have shattering results, as they play out with the inevitability of a long string of dominoes falling.  It is not the situation, of a young girl caught with her family in the 1942 round-up of Jews in Paris, and the woman writing the story of that round-up years later ... but how it plays out. And Sarah's Key plays out with deceptive simplicity, in wordless scenes, and evocative interiors, most especially in the performances of Kristin Scott Thomas and Melusine Mayance (who must be France's answer to Dakota Fanning.) The 1942 sequences are faultlessly authentic in feeling, and some of the wordless scenes - of two girls walking through a field of wheat, and floating in a silent pool of river are beautiful, in a painterly way.<br />The extras are also worth watching; how location shooting and meals were organized (without nearly as much fuss as their American counterparts would have been), brief  interviews and features focusing on the various actors - none of which save for Kristin Scott Thomas will be familiar to an American audience which again is a nice change. The movie and all the features are in French with English subtitles, so careful attention must be paid.

B001TODO72|5.0|This is, to put it very simply, an amazing book. It's so filled with humanity and understanding and love and memories, it's almost impossible to review. You want to just hand it to people and say, \\"Here. Read this. Now.\\" Ah, well. Bechdel grew up in Beech Creek, Pennsylvania, just off I-80, in one of the folds of the Allegheny Front Range, surrounded by the homes of her father's extended family, none of whom ever seemed to leave the area. Her mother wasn't a local girl, though, and her parents were married in Europe, where they seemed to be making plans to stay. But then her grandfather died and her Dad had to come back and take over the family funeral home -- the \\"fun home.\\" There wasn't that much business, usually, in such a backwater, so he also taught English at the high school. Alison grew up knowing her parents were different in many ways from most of the community. They were intellectuals, for one thing, and well educated. Her Dad was an aesthete, constantly rebuilding and redecorating their large, Victorian home, while her mother acted in the local theater and pursued a graduate degree. Alison found she fit that same sort of mold, reading most of the books in her father's large library and thinking hard about the world and the people around her. Moreover, her attitudes and tastes as a kid were pretty butch and she finally realized, in college, that she was gay (though she obviously suspected it before that). But when she came out to her parents, she discovered that her father also was homosexual -- or maybe bisexual, since he had a family. And shortly after that, he was dead, run over on the state highway by a Sunbeam bread truck. Or was it, as she strongly suspects, actually suicide, the result of his desperation? He had had, she discovered, numerous relationships with men -- including her teenage babysitter when she was little -- and had gotten in trouble several times as a result. In trying to deal with all this, Bechdel turns her considerable analytical powers to an investigation, a study, of her parents, and what brought them together, and their relationship to their kids and to each other. She might not ever find conclusive answers as she takes the reader through the events of her early life and describes the observations she made growing up, and the conclusions she drew from them, and the effects on her. But she's trying. And she largely succeeds. The thing is, this is not just a picture book with captions. If Bechdel were not also a talented artist, this book might well have been an award-winning, best-selling literary memoir instead an award-winning, best-selling \\"graphic novel\\" (though the library shelves it, rightfully, in the biography section). Her style, in both her writing and her drawing, is thoughtful and deeply nuanced and you will want to revisit the pages and consider what she says, and shows, again and again. And you'll be thinking about Alison and her family for some time to come.powers to an investigation, a study, of her parents, and what brought them together, and their relationship to their kids and to each other.

B005V4X8JA|5.0|I've been collecting the fine remastered 24K Gold CDs by a wide variety of popular artists and their classic recordings from Audio Fidelity, the California record label who deals in high quality sound reproduction and superior packaging - the CDs are worth the few pennies more you may pay when compared to standard reproductions. I've been very accepting regarding some of the albums that were not necessarily on the top-of-my-want list, but however piqued my general curiosity about remastered recordings.    When the company released the influential, Crosby, Stills & Nash debut recording by David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash, they were treading on sacred soil.  I always believed there was more that could be pulled from this record than we were given to   hear, as brilliant as it is, as great as the songs are, I felt something sonically was left behind. Very much a studio record, but no air or life to the fidelity. Yes, this album has been released in many forms and configurations over the years and some of the better among them only served to lend credence to my sense of a missing essence while the others were smothered, dead and lacking substance.  And then, BOOM, just like that, in one auriferous explosion everything shifted with the arrival of Audio Fidelity's game-changing reissue - the bar hasn't just been raised, this production is the Mt. Olympus of Crosby, Stills & Nash while nearly every other version of the historical album is merely mortal.  I trusted this CD would sound stunning and though I thought I knew this album sonically and   where the potential for improvement would rest I joyfully underestimated. There's more here to hear than I suspected beginning with the blending of voices and instruments and sounds I   never heard before. There are noteworthy differences in tonality from the individual solo singing to the group vocals. The vocals are a bit more up front or prominent. The harmonies sound so sweet, you can hear deep into the mix of thevocals with a clarity that reveals a true lifelike sound. With this mastering, credited to Steve Hoffman, the musicians are not so much set on a stage in front of you as they are instead placed in the room around you.   The 24K Gold CD offers an unimaginable new level of resolution, it is nice and clear and not   too bright. There's a warm, really nice sound, smooth with resoundingly deep lows. The bass   is crystal clear - amazingly clean and rich bass notes. More definition around the vocals and   instruments that allow a smooth feeling of separation. I've discovered small details I never   noticed such as the guitar strings being touched and played - nuances in the guitars that   simply weren't there before and an exceptional realism in the sound of the drums and   percussion.   For the first time I am hearing the sheer power of this magical music. There are certain lines in \\"Marrakesh Express\\"  that I've never heard with such clarity. How could \\"Suite:Judy Blue Eyes\\" ever sound better than remembered; well, for one and two, it has a smoother sound and better lows.  Nothing is lost on this special release from the David Crosby \\"come in my kitchen\\" piece to   the reintroduction of drummer Dallas Taylor peeking out from behind the broken glass pane of   the closed door pictured on the CD art.  Speaking of the art, before I close something must be said about the CD packaging, starting   with the company's unique slip case to the beautiful and authentic booklet that mirrors the   sense of the original LP album cover in color and texture. Included too are all the song lyrics, the original insert pen and ink design drawing, a copy of the original release 12\\" labels and the 4-color 2-page spread of the famous photo of the band dressed in parkas against a sun drenched backdrop.  Throughout the entire disc, absolutely nothing stands out as not sounding perfect,it is all just so musical. Presence, detail, depth and warmth are the ingredients every great recording should boast. This CD has become my go-to recording of this classic for without a doubt this is not only one of the best CDs Audio Fidelity has ever released, but they can lay claim to producing the definitive version of Crosby, Stills & Nash.

030788743X|5.0|This book was simply fun.  I read it in less than a day and a half.  The author, Ernest Cline, has a described an all too easy-to-see near dystopian future where the only escape is OASIS, a simulation that once started as a massive-multiplayer-online game (MMO).  OASIS provides a virtual world much more beautifully rendered than the real world could ever be.  It's creator, James Halliday, was an eccentric genius with a passion for pop-culture, most notably the 1980's.    Upon Halliday's death, he sends a message to every player in OASIS, inviting them to find the \\"Easter Egg\\" he has hidden somewhere inside OASIS.  The first to capture the egg will inherit Halliday's fortune and controlling interest in OASIS' parent company, GSS.  Players and even corporations undertake the hunt but alas, five years later, there hasn't been a single name added to the scoreboard that tracks players along their quest to find the egg.  The protagonist and narrator, Wade Watts, sees the contest as his only escape from the bleak and poverty-stricken existence in a trailer park outside of Oklahoma City.  In a Willy-Wonka meets World of Warcraft mash-up, Wade will use his extensive knowledge of 1980's pop-culture and incredible game playing skills to hunt down the artifacts that Halliday has left behind to lead players to the now mythical egg.  But Wade is not the only one looking for the Egg, and the competition gets more dangerous, both inside and outside the OASIS, as Wade and others get closer to the the ultimate prize.

B002QW7AJY|5.0|This movie has an awesome concept.  With out giving away too much,it has a very good twists.  Just make sure when you watch it, there isn't too much light in the room.  I would love to possibly see a \\"part II\\".
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Let me start off by saying this. Those that are griping about the quality of the original theatrical version: IT NEVER LOOKED THIS GOOD BACK IN THE THEATRE BACK IN 1977. Don't you remember? At the theatres, you would sometimes see a dark line or film spots on the movie screen that came from seeing a REAL FILM. You are lucky to even have this copy...which, by the way, IS NOT EVEN THE VERSION THAT WAS SHOWN IN 1977! Yes, that's right...this is the 1978 re-release. How can you tell? There are several differences (mainly sound), some of which were restored and added back in. Here they are:  1. The scene where Aunt Beru speaks to Uncle Owen after Luke leaves the dinner table: her voice has been overdubbed. To my knowledge, her 1977 original voice has never been restored.  2. Death Star scene - \\"Close the blast doors!\\" line by a stormtrooper while chasing Han and Chewie in the corridor. This was in the original 1977 sound print, but not in the original theatrical version on this dvd. Restored for the special editions.  3. Death Star scene - Han and Luke are dressed as stormtroopers and taking Chewie to the detention area. In the corridor, the mouse droid appears and Chewie yells and scares the droid away. This scene was NOT in the 1977 print.  4. The battle of Yavin - as the X-wings approach the Death Star, they set their wings in attack position. The 1977 sound print included a \\"siren\\" sound as the X-wings open. It disappeared for the '78 re-release and later was restored in the special editions.  It has been so many debates about which variations of the movies are better. I will say I was very happy when the Jabba the Hut scene was restored along with one of the important scenes with Biggs Darklighter; however, some of the spots where there is obvious \\"cleaning up\\" of the film I dislike very much (such as the Greedo scene and the gunfight in the detention area on the Death Star). But it is still the greatest movie of all time to me.
B00008EY9G|5.0|My second time watching this movie and the creepiness really sunk in.  It's a movie you must give your undivided attention to in order to appreciate the whole of its parts.  You will watch it a second time either because you stepped away, answered a phone call or did something that distracted you.  Or you'll watch again just because it really is that good.<br /><br />If you see this movie and decide it wasn't that great, please watch it again. I did and now consider it a top notch psycho-suspense thriller set in a very dark and disturbing place.<br /><br />\\"I wish I wish he'd go away\\"

1439107955|5.0|You may not be able to get a PhD after reading this book, but its approach to the history and development of the battle against cancer will provide a lot of answers to the nagging questions about \\"why don't they cure it?\\" and takes the starch out of the theories that a conspiriacy by the pharmaceutical companies, doctors, hospital, the media and big busineses are keeping \\"cures\\" hidden so that all of us will get sick and make these people richer.  For those who choose to defy what is now common sense information about diet, exercise, lifestyle choices in habits, this book should be read and its facts held on to much as a drowning person would grasp for a life preserver.

B006VC3LES|5.0|Why does Amazon insist on clumping all versions of Chinatown into one review!? It bothers me to no end that I have to delete my past reviews to accomodate a new review of a newer version. This will be the third time I reviewed a home video product of this masterpiece. No matter how many formats (from Beta tape) this film really \\"shines\\" on blu ray. I didn't know what to expect because I remember all the past versions being \\"hazy\\" like a film noir should look, but that haze is gone and the detail really stands out! The colors are bold and are not brown tinted (like on the laserdisc) and really gives this classic a new life. I will never forget seeing this for the first time in widescreen. Did not realize how much was cropped off for pan and scan versions. And this blu ray reminds me of the first time witnessing this in widescreen. This is one lovely looking picture. The whole frame is being used beautifully.<br />The sound is Dolby True HD 5.1 or mono. The 5.1 is preferred, even though it sounds mono in nature.<br />The special features are good too. The best, to me, is the one with Roman Polanski (and others) discussing the making of the film. This special feature is worth the price alone! I have always been fascinated with Polanski and his film making style and to see and hear him discuss this classic is pure joy for me. They don't make films like this anymore!!<br />I am so glad to see this classic at its best in 1080p. Can't wait for a new format with higher resolution to come along and replace blu ray, but I will settle for this version for now.<br />This is the ultimate way to view this great piece of art.<br />This blu ray review was written on April 19, 2012.

I could not have been happier I got this from the library - it would be a true waste of money. The book starts off ok and gets so incredibly silly that it only reminds me 'Honey I Shrunk The Kids' - I mean, really... Completely unbelievable, worst dialogue - amazing bag of cheese. Sadly, this is my first Michael Crichton book so it might take me a while to read his previous work. While I know this was published after his death and written by Richard Preston, I expected so much more.
1594203059|4.0|I do not consider myself something else than a history lover, but I do think that the almost excessive positive critics to jews and jewish lifestyle within the book and history may become too much. They have done, as anybody else, a lot of mistakes and atrocities throughout history as well.  However, the book itself is an extreme recopilation and research of 500 years of our most recent world history. The accuracy in the short comments written in a very simple language that even a 10 year-old kid would understand it. The book language as well is far from complicated and the recopilation of data, well written, in a basis of storytelling make you feel as if you were seeing such moments in history again by your own eyes.   The author makes a short brief conclusion of the problematic exposed in the beginning of the book and most importantly, he points out - from his perspective - the way we as a western civilization can re-flourish or correct still on time.

B0002IQJUK|5.0|I have to admit I didn't know what to expect from this CD but was very pleasantly surprised. I had heard \\"I Don't Want To Be\\" on the radio and loved it. On a whim, I bought the CD when I was out shopping, and didn't expect the rest of the album to be so consistently good, but it is. While \\"I Don't Want To Be\\" remains my favorite track on the CD, there are numerous other standouts as well including the popular \\"Chariot\\" and \\"Over-Rated,\\" another of my favorites.<br /><br />The beauty of the album is the eclectic amalgamation of styles from pop (obviously,) rock, and blues, with a weird alternative undercurrent. DeGraw undoubtedly has a powerful singing style (though he occasionally flirts with giving an overwrought performance,) and has clear command of the material and the needed vocal range to pull off these songs. For those of you who doubt this, give a listen to the bonus disc, \\"Stripped,\\" and his interpretation of the Sam Cooke classic \\"Change Is Gonna Come.\\" \\"Stripped\\" was one of the big reasons I bought the CD versus just downloading a few choice tracks: I love hearing alternate, unenhanced versions of music (e.g. \\"Unplugged,\\") and while not simply DeGraw and a guitar or piano (there are rhythm and drum parts) I really enjoyed \\"Stripped.\\" In fact my initial inclination was to give the album four stars due to some homogeneity in the songs as originally presented, but \\"Stripped\\" changed my mind, and made the five star rating the only logical choice. On balance I still prefer listening to \\"Chariot\\" in its original form, but \\"Stripped\\" provides a refreshing alternative approach to the material and the bonus of \\"Change Is Gonna Come.\\" You might not think a young guy like DeGraw could pull off the Cooke civil rights watershed, but he does so convincingly and respectfully.<br /><br />I am surprised I liked this CD as much as I did as I am not generally a fan of the genre, but DeGraw is clearly a talented performer and has genre-defying dynamism: \\"Chariot\\" is a really good effort, and will provide hours of listening pleasure.ill provide hours of listening pleasure.
B000MV9026|4.0|I like penguins, so I loved the DVD.  The penguins dancing was darling and it also featured the adalia which is my favorite.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I purchased by accident, considered asking for a refund, but kept it and read the book.  The book was very good, but I would not buy again.  There are thousands of good books that cost less than $5 that I feel it wasn't worth the price.  For example, I just finished an Ian Rankin mystery that was on a daily deal for $2-3, and it was very good.
B0032UYFA6|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two seasons. The overall premise, the acting, the writing, the directing, of those two seasons, just superb. So tight and cohesive, and guess what, believable! This third season, though, is too disjointed or too disingenuous. The plot lines with some of the characters seem inauthentic and uninspired, particularly with Jesse, who we're supposed to believe will give up or jeopardize 1.5 million dollars to sell nickel and dime bags and get a recovering addict hooked? Sorry writers, that is just weak. A lot more thought could have gone into his plight, especially after what he went through in season 2. And what is with Walt as well? Are we supposed to believe he has lost his moral code in the finale? Really? I think the writers got lazy. Some episodes were terrible (Fly) while others were on point (One Minute). Basically I didn't care for this season overall, but some episodes are pretty good. I have not seen season four or five yet, but this is how I would rate the first few seasons: I'd give a 3.5 out of 5 for Season Three, a 4.5 for Season One and a 5 for Season Two.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|This toy has been in the house only a week and has been played with for hours. The ramps are slightly annoying because they can easily come off, and the 15 month old runs off with them, but I am sure we could glue them down if we so desired. I like the look and feel of the rubberwood. The kids love the car elevator and the car wash. It seems very sturdy-ily built.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Have played this game more than any other. Love that you don't have to drag cards,  but simply tap the card to move it to the proper spot.&quot;&quot;
1410433765|1.0|I searched for a long time to find a Large Print copy of \\"Freedom\\" by Jonathan Franzen and this is precisely what was ordered. Instead I received a small print book which, due to my Mother's lower vision, she cannot read. Doesn't anybody check orders to make sure that the item is CORRECT ???  Almost Christmas and now I can't give her this book, but also have to go to the time and effort of returning it.  So annoying !!!
B00000DOY9|3.0|\\"Presence\\" #1  (1976)  \\"Presence\\", was to me Led Zeppelin's weakest album, but it would of been a classic for most hard rock bands at the time.  Page was still abusing drugs at the time.  After this was released they went on tour and made the movie soundtrack \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", as they were on tour Robert Plant lost his son Karac to a stomach infection.  On this album you get the classic blues of \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine, the Elvis type tune \\"Candy Store Rock\\" and the epic \\"Achilles Last Stand\\".  Just not a favorite, but it is still passable.
B000003RCY|5.0|This is a great CD to have if you love Rammstein as I do. The cost was not too high and a couple of my favorite songs are on there, especially 'Du riechst so gut' and 'weisses Fleisch'  Watch the videos of the songs as well. They are very. . . . Rammstein. Hope you enjoy!
B000002JSN|4.0|\\"Physical Graffiti\\" #1 (1975).  Led Zeppelin's 6th studio album \\"Physical Graffiti\\", is a double album of wild experimentation.  At the time Jimmy Page was way into drug abuse, and you could tell something was different with him on some of these songs.  Here's what's inside, the swirling rhythms of \\"Custard Pie\\", the pulsive \\"The Rover\\", the long winded blues of \\"In My Time Of Dying\\", the bouncy and excellent \\"Houses of The Holy\\", the #38 hit \\"Trampled Under Foot\\", a great piece  in the Zeppelin catalog.  The unforgettable \\"Kashmir\\", a classic in all rock circles.  The synth driven \\"In The Light\\", John Paul Jones stars here.  The acoustic \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\", beautiful.  The relaxed \\"Down By The Seaside\\", the next 6 songs were a grab bag, I liked the 50's style \\"Boogie With Stu\\" and the hippiedom of \\"Ten Years Gone\\".  The first album that didn't rate 5 stars, but their next release \\"Presence\\", sunk them deeper into mediocrity in 1976.
B005SODYGA|5.0|Before buying this, I had imagined that there were new songs in here, especially as Rammstein started touring the US. Previously, it was stated that they were not intending on come to the States again.  The CD opens up like a flower, strangely enough, with flaps going in all different directions. Each flap has a bust of the members of the band and inside are 2 CDs. The 1st is a mixture of all the classics, such as 'Du Hast', 'Engel' and 'Mein Teil'. The latter has songs that were remixed with 'Black Strobe Remix' and 'Clawfinger Remix'.  It's definitely something to buy if you don't have any Rammstein music in your media library. If you do, you may want to consider waiting until you find a used version just to have the remixes.  I hope you enjoy Rammstein as I do.

B004GGTAQE|2.0|Let me preface this by admitting that I could not bring myself to finish this book on my Kindle, which now feels just a little dirty because she now has this book. I can only hope that my comments are overtaken by later events in the book, and I would welcome later reviews correcting these views.  On the one hand I cannot be unfair, but on the other I cannot read more without becoming ill.  A self-serving memoir by a dedicated member of the Master Race.  He praises the German WWII soldier for a quality which is hateful -- if the Fatherland calls its youth to fight and die for a cause which is either beyond evil, nonexistant or, at best, not understood, he is an example for all the world to emulate. \\"Salute and shoot.\\"  No apologies for the horrible things done by the Hitler regime, of which he was a proud part on the battlefield.   But -- on reflection, it may serve us well today to be exposed to the thinking we see by the author, as we see our \\"heroes\\" returning from their many wasted years in the middle east, patting themselves on the back, declaring victory, and closing their eyes to the shambles they leave behind them.  We are capable of being the same as the author, and we must not forget that. I had to give him a couple of stars for reawakening a failing memory.  This from a retired disabled veteran.

0307946711|2.0|This book had received such rave reviews that I was longing to get my hands on it. What a disappointment! Extremely long and winding narrative. There were periods that I thought were of redeeming quality, and suddenly it would spiral down again. Did not like the end either. Avoid!

140053271X|5.0|- fashionable design, I particularly like the white rim  - the page turn buttons are sturdy(while others complained about the \\"stickyness\\" I actually preferred it)  - love, love, love the shelves option - I work at a library and enjoy putting things where they belong  - can download your own screensavers (I have harry potter illustrations)  - incredibly easy to set up  - you can see the covers of your books  cons  - pages do turn easily if you brush the screen with a blanket or something  - wi-fi can be difficult to connect to at times  - cannot delete/manipulate library content through device, only computer  - B&N.com has a more limited selection than Amazon  Even given the Cons, I still prefer this e-reader to the sterile looking kindle, where customization is non-existent. I've had the device for a month and am thrilled. I have read three books and a magazine with the device with ease.
B00004XPPB|4.0|This was a compelling movie that really hits the spot when it comes to detailing two \\"Goodfellas\\" joined at the hip. Lefty Ruggiero befriends a young hood named \\"Donnie Brasco\\" whom he suspects as a succesful jewel thief/appraiser. He brings him into his cadre of preffesional crooks and thieves only to be surprised as \\"Donnie\\" begins to supplant him in the eyes of the new boss. This was a great character study of not just a federal agent but the man he eventually betrays.  Unlike Al Pacino's other mob roles (Scarface, Carlito's Way), this is a man who never reached the top in over 30 years of working the rackets. He wanted to move up yet he never had the chance; perhaps because of a lack of ruthlessness, perhaps because of a lack of intelligence or a combination of the two, he could never climb out of the cesspool he was in and as a result he became mired in a dead end occupation. This (Along With Lefty's Refusal To Vete Brasco) led to his destruction.  But let's not forget the perfidy of \\"Agent Pistone.\\" His actions put alot of men behind bars for life and led to the murdur of Lefty Ruggiero. That's something I despise about him and any undercover fed. Whether it's so-called Agent Pistone or the \\"sharpshooter\\" Lon Horinuchi they are all evil in my book.    A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.

B004LSO6YI|5.0|Wow, it was a very well-made movie. These actresses did an excellent job. You could feel the emotions, and that's when you know it's a good movie. It's true what the man says it's \\"soulametry\\" :)
B003D83DPA|3.0|This sounds very good. However, this doesn't fill my screen and i don't understand why this was put onto Blu Ray. Does the sound make that much of a difference between DVD and Blu blu ray that you would offer inferior video on a blu ray disc. To me this really makes no sense. I don't understand why these music companies continue to rake us.   JMO.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I like this guy's singing, and I was enjoying the album until \\"All I Want for Christmas is You\\", and there was that grating autotune voice.  It is not present in any of the other songs as far as I can tell, but it is so obvious on this one.  Why? Maybe we need mandated autotune warning stickers on albums.  Sinatra, Crosby, and Williams never needed autotune.  But if you can skip this one song, it is an enjoyable album.
B005BRS8Z6|2.0|I finally got around to reading this much hyped book after several years and 900+ reviews on here..<br />Unfortunately, I did have the assumption that the book would contains something about Toltec or Native American wisdom, but was disappointed to find nothing of the kind, and instead just another new-thought/positive thinking/self-help time waster.<br /><br />If I followed the \\"Have no assumptions..\\" advice (the third agreement), perhaps I wouldn't have been disappointed by the above, but then I would have saved my time in reading this book. Fortunately, the book can be read in half a day or less.<br /><br />On the positive side, it gives people 4 simple rules that they probably learned in Kindergarten (Be kind, be truthful, try your best, and don't take things personally). On the negative side, it contains zero Toltec wisdom or history (despite the author claiming he is heir of an ancient esoteric lineage), and includes all the standard Western and Eastern motivational stories about doing the right thing (but where's the Toltec stories?!). At the end of the book (of course) it gives further info on purchasing more books and seminars etc. (since this book failed to deliver anything of lasting value?)<br /><br />Not bad for teachings some simple morals to a five year old, but falls short of the marketing hype and life changing, heaven producing promises in the first chapter.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My son is a Lego fanatic. I, however, am not a fan of stepping on Legos in the middle of the night when I go in to check on him. We have tried plastic bins, boxes and baskets......but to no avail. He wants to keep his creations intact and out for display. This was the perfect compromise. He makes his creation, plays with it on the scene mat this folds out to and when it's time to put them away, he can simply zip the case up around it. He still feels like his things are being \\"displayed\\" since the bin is Lego Star Wars, and he knows they are safely inside.....and no more hopping around in pain for Mom in the middle of the night. I found three different varieties of this product on Amazon.com and snapped up all three.......we both are happy. Great product!!

It has numerous vintage pictures throughout.  I found myself getting excited every time I knew the next page turn would reveal a picture to embelish the story.  The writer did an outstanding job; especially for a first novel.

B0031Y4ALC|1.0|I'd rate this zero stars if i could. I ordered \\"The Cure: Disintegration\\" on NEW VINYL. I received a USED CD. When I called, I was told I could return the item and they would expedite the correct item to me (this is a Christmas gift and I would now receive it after the 25th). Once I went to my email to print the return label, there was a note saying they could not exchange the item and I would just have to return the incorrect item. I am very upset with this poor customer service and such miscommunication. Now my boyfriend will not be receiving this item for Christmas, and Hastings is refusing to send the correct item
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Although i'm not sure how long this show can go on...it's slated already for three seasons, & they're just now coming up to the end of the second, each episode leaves u craving more.  it's a fun show to watch, good acting & lots of excitement.  recommend this to anyone who likes the zombie genre...or just any old horror fan.
B0036T32LQ|4.0|If you've ever sailed off the coast of FL and into the Bermuda Triangle, this is a must see movie.  It fits right in with the tales and myths of the waters of the Triangle.    Ignore the Groundhog Day comparisons.  Triangle is not nearly as simple as Groundhog Day; the plot is not that predictable.  If you let your image run, Triangle is a fictional voyage not to let pass.  It moves along at a nice pace with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing.  The acting is above par.    A classic it may not be.  However, it is a great flick to pass a bit of time.    Let the wind fill your sails.  Enjoy.
0060873027|3.0|Crichton's body of work has raised expectations to a lofty level, so it's predictable that this book is subjected to intense scrutiny. The writing is crisp and you do get an education, although it can be difficult to separate science from where he stretches it.  Where there's a disconnect is in the credibility of the characters, who also tend to be a bit thin. For instance, you have genius heading a company that's breaking new ground in the field of microrobotics. But, when he rigs an outboard motor to fail by planting a cell phone to trigger it, he can't come up with a self-destruct or some other mechanism that would belie the appearance of an accident? That doesn't even address leaving a trail of cell calls, including the one to trip the sabotage device. It doesn't compute that he'd be that inept.  Likewise, when it appears that predators and their pursuers have wiped out the shrunken party, he is vociferous about not taking chances and adamantly insists that his head of security follow up. And yet, when their vehicle's tracking system indicates that it has rolled down the face of the mountain, he assumes they're done for(after they already proved they survived the attack of the predators and his death squad, mind you). Consistency?  In spite of the glitches in character and plot, there's enough Crichton in this to supply a fix for those who need it.

B000002MUQ|5.0|I have been a huge VH fan for years and while I may get a lot of flack for liking Sammy more than Dave I will not make this review (as some of my fellow reviewers have done) about why Sammy is better than Dave or vice versa. Balance is a rocking cd that I personally enjoy every track on it. To date this is only 1 of 2 cds that I can pop in and listen from the beggining track to the end track and love all the songs. Some of VH's most iconic Hagar era songs are found on this cd but the only one missing is \\"Right Now\\", to get that song you need to pick up For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge or Best of: Volume 1. Do not be swayed by reviewers who can only accept one singer and view any change as trash...this cd is awesome and you won't regret picking it up.
B00008O31H|1.0|This was my first and last Black Keys disk.  I could barely get through it, but gave it several spins to make sure I wasn't missing anything. Sure enough all I'm missing is the $12 I spent on it.  I heard no blues soul, and Auerbach should let someone (anyone) else handle the vocals.
B000002LEM|2.0|While I love VH and also am a Hagar fan this cd isn't really worth picking up other than to finish your collection. None of the songs are very engaging and to be honest I actually had to look at the track listing to remember what was on it. My lack of memory wasn't due to not being informed it was in fact due to remembering that there really wasn't anything note worthy on it (and I had to check the list to make sure I wasn't mistaken). I have most all of VH's cds and this one is played the least in my collection.

I was trully impressed the quality and the price!! could not have found a better price anywhere else but here!!!

B0034G4P4O|5.0|The truth is I don't care much for movie reviews, so I didn't know what to expect when I went to watch this movie.  I liked Tintin from the first time I read one of the books back some 45 years ago.  Since then, I've always had one or another Tintin item here or there.  AS far as the movie goes, I liked it.  It  wasn't exactly like the story on the book, but the movie adaptation more or less followed the general idea of the story.  The movie was action from beginning to end.  The special graphic effects were outstanding and the future of many movies to come.  I saw it in 3D and I liked it too.  The old 3D used to give me a headache sometimes. But this new 3D looks great and you get used to it fairly quick.  All the actors did justice to the characters they were playing.  Craig, Bell and Serkis did an excellent job with their characters.  The story line, special effects and 3D, as well as the large pop corn I had were all good.  I even got a senior discount on the ticket.  What more could I have asked for?

B00003CY6M|5.0|The title of this movie says it all: Serendipity - good fortune; luck; desirable discoveries by accident. It is a fantasy from the beginning and a fairly well thought out fantasy as well. Keeping that in mind, this is a movie that is as entertaining as it is thought provocative. Yes, there are some over the top coincidences, even the director acknowledges that. But that is part of what makes this movie so fun to watch. I cannot understand many of the negative reviews that bash the impossibility of it all. It's a movie! This is why we go to movies. To see and experience things we cannot always have or do in real life. It's not for everyone. If you are looking for action/adventure, go buy The Terminator. If you are looking for a romantic fantasy that has likable characters and a fun storyline, this is a great movie to watch, even several times to catch the things you missed earlier.<br /><br />185
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I really love this game! It's a great time killer because before you realize it, you've been playing for hours!
B004KA9VGA|5.0|Oh gosh. Where to start? This book was recommended and I didn't know what to expect. I hadn't even read the blurb. When I picked it up, I didn't know I'd fall in love with another book. It was mammoth, but I found I loved the fact it was. I didn't want it to end and I'm waiting in anticipation of the next instalment.   The book is called A Discovery of Witches, but really it should be called a discovery of witches, and daemons and vampires and history. It opened up a world so beautifully described and rich, that it almost felt real.   The characters were so well written and rounded. Matthew was extraordinary. I never expected to be so enamoured by him. Even with his secrets and old fashioned ways, I still loved him. All the other characters, no matter how minor, were worthy of their place. The daemons were wonderful, and Diana's aunts were amusing. Matthew's mother was an unexpected but fabulous addition.   Harkness kept me on edge, wondering if what I was reading was true. If the whole host and range of characters were being honest with me. It was an uncanny feeling at times.   We are swept along Oxford streets and through French castles, not to mention getting roped into the classic (or not so classic, what with real witches) American Halloween.   The history covered in this book was extensive, but it all added to the world I got swept into. The poetry, alchemy and manuscripts were beautiful additions.   This book is a romance, come mystery, come historical fantasy. It's so many books rolled into one, and it all works so well. For me, this book was one of beautiful worlds, increasingly addictive relationships and well kept secrets that I cannot wait to unravel.  I think this has been another of my favourite books of the year. Much praise to Harkness.

B000002J09|5.0|In spite of Led Zeppelin's long-standing reputation as a loud English heavy metal group, their music was far more sophisticated than that.  This 1971 release is a great example of that in fact, and showcases well-composed and arranged music that covers a wide dynamic range - no, it is not all loud.<br /><br />Although the album opens with a few tracks that could peel the paint off the wall, the largely acoustic track Battle of Evermore, featuring guest vocalist Sandy Denny from folk/rock group Fairport Convention and the excellent Going to California are very relaxing pieces of music.  Meditative even.  Stairway to Heaven really is a very well put together piece of music - come to think of it, no matter how many times I listen to it, I still love it.  In fact, I do not think that the clean arrangement of Stairway to Heaven, with its gradual build to a climactic finish, can be beat.<br /><br />The music on Led Zeppelin IV is sophisticated and boasts asymmetric time signatures and complex meter shifts - Black Dog (alternating bars of five, four, and two) and Four Sticks (alternates 5/8 and 6/8) are great examples.  As a long-time progressive fan, I really enjoyed the references to nature in some of the lyrics that were a hallmark of progressive music back in the day.  The players are all excellent, although I really have to single out Jimmy Page and (the late) John Bonham.<br /><br />This remastered CD does not come close to my old LP, but it does feature the lyrics to Stairway to Heaven, the original inner gatefold artwork, and good sound quality.<br /><br />All in all, this is a classic album for a reason.  Highly recommended along with III (1970), Houses of the Holy (1973), and Physical Graffiti (1975).

B0025KVLUQ|4.0|Abbey Road Remastered has an incredible sound and clarity and is a marked improvement over previous Abbey Road CD offerings. My biggest complaint about this version are the skips between songs on the B-side while on the true and original LP version these songs constitute one continuous track. It's these skips that force me to give this CD only four stars. I've been listening to Abbey Road since about 1976 and I have the album in more different formats than I care to think about, from open-reel tape to lowly cassettes and from CD to Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab's half-speed mastered LP. I consider it to be the greatest Beatles album of all and it certainly ranks in the top ten of any rock album on my list. Given that, it's hard for me to listen to the B-side of this album on CD when it's broken up by the skips and it seems to me that all that effort spent in remastering this album was wasted by not eliminating them. If you're new to the Beatles and looking for their greatest album, you've found it and don't let me stop you from buying this CD. If you already have this CD and are wondering if this one is any better, it is, trust me. If you love this album like I do, you'll have a love-hate relationship with it. The sound is fabulous but you have to pay the price for it and the price is the lack of continuity on the B-side. Oh, they didn't fix the pitch change on \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" either. In fact, it's more noticeable than ever with this cleaner version.
1451627289|3.0|The first Stephen King book I have ever read!! It was not what I expected. However the book was still entertaining nevertheless.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|In the grand scheme of things, I've always had a soft spot for reboots.  There is something about redoing a series or a series of movies (Batman) that allows for a different take...in TV, it's become the \\"fleshing out\\" of a storyline that draws me.  The one example that I can clearly point to is \\"Battlestar Gallactica\\".  I have never denied my dislike of the old series, its cheesy special effects...and that dislike of the old series has likely enhanced my fondness for the reimaged version we had in the last decade.  But BSG 2003 was incredibly topical for the time--uncomfortably so at points, given how it was mirroring the Iraq conflict, its views of torture, and the way the series delved into religion.    The reboot of \\"Hawaii Five-0\\" isn't meant to be a series with deep undertones, obviously.  In both it's versions, the series has had one constant co-star--the islands and the scenery that make up the 50th state.  The beaches, the mountains, the stunning view of Honolulu and the rural areas...those sights haven't changed.  But the difference--as we have seen with many series that had their origins in the late 1960s and early 1970s and have been brought back to the screen in the 21st century--is the much more complete history we get in the reboots.    I fully admit that I could either take or leave the old version of \\"Five-0\\".  I loved the theme song--there isn't a person who has heard that track who does NOT love that music.  But I was never a great fan of that cast--Jack Lord and friends seemed bland, almost wooden at times; and as with all television at the time, we were dropped into the middle of the Five-0 unit's world at the beginning of the series.    So it only figured that this generation's \\"Hawaii Five-0\\" would introduce us to the unit from its origins, with a fuller accounting of the characters and the tale.  Which is why we meet Steve McGarrett as a Navy SEAL, born on \\"The Big Island\\", sent away from Hawaii for his safety by his police officer father,only to be drawn back after his father is murdered by the brother of a terrorist McGarrett has captured...which leads into the larger mystery of his father, and a long-term investigation he was conducting.  Accepting a \\"gloves-off\\" position from the Governor of the state, McGarrett puts together a group of \\"Untouchables\\"; allowed to go after the bad guys as they see fit, and HOW they see fit.    The casting for this series has been excellent, even if CBS influenced part of it.  The Eye has a habit of, when they latch onto a male star they feel has \\"it\\", they WILL find something for that actor. There have been some pretty good examples of that philosophy--Mark Harmon had \\"Chicago Hope\\" before \\"NCIS\\".  Simon Baker had \\"The Guardian\\" and was part of the short-lived \\"Smith\\" ensemble before \\"The Mentalist\\".  David Caruso had \\"Michael Hayes\\" before \\"CSI Miami\\".  Alex O'Laughlin had been the Apple of the execs at The Eye for four years.  They introduced the Aussie to America as the vampire dectective Mick St. John in \\"Moonlight\\" in 2007, as one of the doctors of \\"Three Rivers\\" in 2009, and as the male lead in the CBS Productions' movie \\"The Back-Up Plan\\" also in 2009.  Suffice it to say that someone at CBS knew they had SOMETHING with O'Laughlin, they just needed to figure out the perfect setting and role.  Hello the \\"Five-0\\" reboot, and hello to the iconic role of McGarrett.  O'Laughlin has a LOT of fun with his take--it's a far more physical and humorous role than what Lord did back in the day; emphasizing his SEAL training and using his Navy connections--especially his female Navy intelligence officer girlfriend (Michelle Borth) to get satellites retasked, how at ease McGarrett is back in Hawaii.  But the ongoing storyline of McGarrett--his father John's murder, and the deeper web that his father was involved in--has become the darker side of Steve, and what drives him.    It was well-known, LONG before \\"Hawaii Five-0\\" was completely put together, that Daniel Dae Kim was going to get Chin Ho Kelly--DDK had fallen for Hawaii during the six years \\"Lost\\" was shot there.  HE WASN'T LEAVING--and really, who could blame him??!?  The backstory of Chin--where Chin is tied to the McGarretts because John was his training officer/first partner, and finding Chin as a \\"mall cop\\" working at the beach after resigning from the Honolulu department under a cloud of suspicion regarding money taken out of lock-up--gives Chin a great internal dignity, a want to prove that he is still a man of the law while protecting the real circumstances of the disappearance of the money.  Again, DDK's Chin is a little rougher than Kam Fong's Chin in the original series--a Harley-ridin', shotgun-toting officer, with a little bit of a history with a certain female doctor (Reiko Aylesworth)...    Obviously, one couldn't even begin to compare Grace Park's Kono Kalakaua with Zulu from HF-0, version 1.  I've often wondered if Park has spoken to her agent--\\"Next time we try to get me in a series, can it NOT be a situation of a reboot with me playing a formerly male character??!?\\"  Park's Kono--Chin's cousin, the former surfer joining HPD as have many members of Chin and Kono's family--seems as willing to take risks as McGarrett.  She's also as smart as a whip, working around the computers that Five-0 has installed in their offices, and has no qualms about getting phyiscal with bad guys.  Plus, she's gorgeous.  Then again, it's Grace Park--we shouldn't have expected any different.    This brings us to Scott Caan's Danny Williams; a brilliant take on the character by showrunners Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and a scene-stealing season on the part of Caan.  Williams gets reimaged as a HPD detective who transferred from New Jersey to be close to his daughter after his ex-wife remarried and moved to Hawaii.  He DESPISES Hawaii--the beaches, the weather, the attitude, the food (\\"You DON'T PUT PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA!!!!\\"...); he isn't enamored with McGarrett's willingness to notfollow \\"police procedure\\"--and frequently isn't enamored with McGarrett (\\"Anuerysm Face\\"--loved that line), openly wonders why he's letting Steve drive HIS car (Do love that Camaro), has issues with McGarret's T-shirt/cargo pants work clothes while insisting that a tie looks more professional...AND HATES BEING CALLED \\"DANNO\\", except by his daughter.  Clearly, Cann's take on the nominal number-two of Five-0 really goes away from James McArthur.  AND IT IS A BETTER TAKE.  Cann very much reminds me of his father when James was younger and more energetic--his Sonny Corleone days--and the energy he brings to Danny is just a kick.    The supporting players play large--and yes, I'm using that as a pun when I mention Taylor Willy's Kamekona,   Five-0's street information person.  Clearly, the former sumo wrestler isn't a small person.  However, Teilor Grubbs is--and she is solid as Danny's daughter, as is Claire van der Boom as her mother--Danny's ex-wife.  Masi Oka really doesn't get enough screen time as Five-0's medical examiner, Dr. Max Bergmann, though we get enough to realize that Max operates off the beaten path.  Dennis Chun--whose father WAS Kam Tong--has a recurring role as HPD Sgt. Duke Lukela, a character also from the original series.  The veteran actress Jean Smart plays the Governor of Hawaii, Pat Jameson, in the first season.  Without giving any spoilers, it is safe to say that Smart draws liberally from having worked with Gregory Itzin on \\"24\\".      Of course, there's Mark Dacascos--because the legend of \\"Hawaii Five-0\\" must include Wo Fat.  The Chairman from \\"Iron Chef America\\" gives a certain amount of menace to his appearances during the year as the crime boss/terrorist/mercenary/All-Around Bad Guy.  Being the martial artist that he is, Dacascos knows how to radiate the danger that should be associated with the story's main and ongoing antagonist.  Given that in this version of the story, Wo Fat is really connected from the beginning with the deaths of both of McGarrett's parents, it seems proper that while he isn't seen too often in the first season, Wo Fat plays a key part of the storyline.    For the most part, Season 1 of \\"Hawaii Five-0\\" is standard cop fare--murders, kidnappings, piracy...but what makes the season is the writing.  The byplay and verbal sparring between the lead characters is brilliant and well executed.  In it's way the series is more spirited than the original version--again, a good thing. That we have the two ongoing storylines in the season--McGarrett starting to unravel his father's investigation, and the story of why Chin Ho left HPD--draws the viewer into the season.    Bottom line here is that it's a good cast, and it's a great looking cast.  It's a familiar story to many, updated for this generation, and we get to see Hawaii.  It's heavy on the action, good with the humor.  Overall, it's easy on the eyes and an easy story to follow.  Honestly, it's much more watchable than the original series.  That might be sacrilege to some, but to me, it's the truth.    Highly reccommended.
B00000272N|5.0|I recently bought this album to complete my collection of Alice in Chains albums. I must say this is my favorite AIC album by far. I would classify the album as a hard rock/metal sound and should not be lumped together with the work of Nirvana, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam or even AIC's later work. The songs are performed with a lot of raw emotion and creativity and there is a large amount of diversity of songs: all out metal 'We Die Young' to the jazzy 'Sea of Sorrow' and the upbeat 'Sunshine' and 'I Know Something (Bout You), this contrasts to 'Dirt' which seems to be very dense and dark. I truely don't feel there is any filler songs on the album. Finally, the sound quality of early/mid-90s CDs are absolutely supurb as they haven't been over-compressed yet. Thus, if you can get the 1990 vintage CD, the audio quality is sublime.  If you enjoy Alice In Chains or early 90s rock, I would highly recommend this album.
B004TI5N38|1.0|Big fan of Baldacci, but he is better than this.  A 100% rip-off of Lee Child and Jack Reacher.  Everything from saying very little, to drinking coffee, to the internal clock, and those are just the little things.  Save your money and read The Affair.
142312166X|5.0|Very tiny book.<br /><br />Contains two short stories never in the other books; Character pages all about them; Interviews with the characters; and a very enjoyable book.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good read to really sit down and ehjoy this is not your book. But if you are a big Percy Jackson fan and want to learn more about the characters and read small adventures never revealed in the past installments then THIS IS YOUR BOOK!<br /><br />I recommend this book to ALL PERCY JACKSON FANS of ALL AGES (that can read of course). Also people that want to read Percy Jackson. There is nothing negative that I can say about this book.<br /><br />GO OUT THERE AND GET THAT BOOKKkkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I would give this 10 stars if I could.  In just a few short frames, the beginning of the movie encapsulates all the is beautiful and sad about life.  It had me in tears, and my kids could not understand why.  After that, I just wanted to hug my wife and family and let them know I love them.  How many animated movies can create such emotion in a grown man?  Just incredible.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|The positives are that this is a good primer on social media and all the things necessary to be a self published writer. Get a website, a twitter and facebook account. Be nice to people, get their emails, write blogs they will want to read. Don't know whether this will work for anyone else but if I ever decide to publish a book this would be the how to book I'd turn to. Very short, and long on self promotion and self congratulatory anecdotes but worth reading for what it is.

1609611543|2.0|I like the ratings. One star \\"I hated it\\", two stars, \\"I didn't like it\\". Well, I guess I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't like it. I could have given it 3 stars I supposed because it was \\"Ok\\", but I truly did not like it, \\"ok\\" or not.<br /><br />I was so excited about this book before I read it. I will say that I do believe everything he says is probably close to the truth. Its probably a very biased truth for the sake of the book. I do not eat wheat because I have a sensitivity to it. If this book is to be believed everyone has a sensitivity to it. That's a little hard for me to believe. Most of Dr. Davis proof is in the belly, or other trouble spots on the body. I am not sure I can believe this. Its true that wheat is not what it was at the beginning of its lifecycle, but does this make it bad? That's the question I wanted answered in this book. Dr. Davis gave so much scientific and medical evidence that it is. As I was reading Wheat Belly I was so convinced by the evidence presented, until I realized I have been following a wheat-free diet for years and I have not lost a pound from it. I still have a \\"wheat belly\\". The information Dr. Davis gives is extremely detailed and I found myself skimming over it because it was too detailed. Perhaps doctors and scientists would find themselves fascinated by it, but I was bored.<br /><br />I will give credit to the end chapters where you can put his advice into action. There was some useful information there. The recipes, well, they suck frankly. Also, I will say, I don't buy the whole idea that whole grain wheat isn't good for you. I think moderation is the key to health. A little whole wheat is probably good for you. It adds variety to your diet. Socrates said, and I agree, \\"If we could give every individual the right amount of nourishment and exercise, not too little and not too much, we would have found the safest way to health.\\" Think about it. I am tired of extreme thinking. This book is too extreme for me.

B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|I hung with this movie, viewing it until the conclusion, even though I was tempted to turn it off several times.  It's a good enough story, but it has the feeling of a tale that we've all waded through before.  There is no real spark to the performances, and the movie suffers from a slow pace.  Though Helen Mirren and Tom Wilkinson are the actors with the plaudits and reputations to add a certain cachet to a movie like this, most of the screen time goes to their younger counterparts... which leads me to wonder, why isn't Jessica Chastain the featured actor on the dvd cover?  Chastain's is the standout performance in the movie.  On a philosophical level, the movie questions the heroism of the actions of the Mossad agents, then it uses plot twists to nullify the heroism completely, and in the end grants one character a measure of redemption.  It's interesting, but it's way, way overwrought, and though the movie is selling itself as being cerebral, in the end it appeals to emotional prejudices.  People react to movies like these as if the plots were taken from real life.  Well, I've got news-- often as not, they weren't.

B005OK721G|2.0|I love Zoe S but the writing was so bad that she didn't really shine.  The dialogue between her and the police officer was painful.  Even with a better dialogue, I don't think that would've helped the movie enough.  The storyline was weak.  Her family was killed and she spends the rest of her child/teen years becoming an assassin/killer so she can kill the people that murdered her family.  I have seen way better revenge films (Taken, Mechanic, Shooter, Unforgiven, Count of Monte Cristo, etc.).  Two stars because this movie is not a complete yawn.  There are some entertaining moments.
1416905014|4.0|I was so surprised at how elegant the illustrations and pop-ups are.  I know my grandaughter will love it!  Sturdy book with colorful, imaginative pop up images.

B0034G4P94|5.0|I just rented this movie, and it is the best movie I've seen all year.  It had the drama, a great story line, complicated family dynamic, honest acting and intense fighting scenes.  It is WAY better than a lot of the fight movies I've seen.  I'm surprised the movie did not receive more accolades (maybe overshadowed by The Fighter?) and what, no awards??  5 stars without a doubt.

B003XN1JZQ|5.0|As much as I'm enjoying this brilliant series, \\"A Song of Ice and Fire,\\" I'm beginning to think that I'll die of old age before the author wraps up all of the plot lines and concludes with the battle of the dragons versus the creatures from beyond the Wall.  The minor characters have multiplied into a 79 page appendix, which is basically a list of their names, houses, and relationships to the various kings, queens, and their courts.  There is a separate appendix of lordlings, wanderers, and common men.  George Martin is spacing his books so far apart (and with no synopses) that I have to go back and reread the previous entries in the series before I can remember who did what to whom, and why a particular character is lacking a hand or a nose.<br /><br />Nothing good happens to anyone in \\"A Feast for Crows.\\"  One of my favorite characters goes blind.  Another is hung, after a serious loss of face.  I think one of the minor characters is turned into a zombie, although there is very little overt magic in this fourth entry in \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\"  Many of the major characters such as Tyrion, the dwarf, and Dany, the Dragon Queen don't show up at all.  If this series could be likened to Lord of the Rings, then \\"A Feast for Crows\\" is the equivalent of 1060 pages of wandering around in Emyn Muil with Sam and wondering what the hell happened to Frodo.<br /><br />Ice and Fire fans need not worry about the deterioration of Martin's writing 4,000+ pages into this fantasy epic.  It is still as enormously complex and addictive as ever.  His characters live (most of them), breathe, and suffer.  They learn how to get on with life in spite of enormous handicaps.  By the end of book four, all of them have lost loved ones, limbs, noses, eyes, and/or hands but still they struggle on.  My only fear is that I'll never find out how it all ends.
1427209758|5.0|This is truly the best book I have ever read. I came upon it after listening to The Wheel of Time Series. At the start of the book I was not sure if it would be good or not but it really is. It is fast paced right up until the end. I just picked up his other books and I plan on reading this one again, in case I missed anything the first time. What an incredible writer he is. I love the plots, the characters, and the world surrounding them. I truly can't wait for the next and I hope to see many books. I also like the way the Author keeps a blog and tries to keep his readers up to date. I don't think it is fair of those who complain about waiting for a book, he is writing an incredible amount of books that are epics. I think he is fast compared to others and his work is truly incredible. You can see from other reviews about specifics, I just came on to say how much I LOVE this book. Read it, you will not be sorry, the audiobook is great as well and uses the same narrators as the wheel of time.

1935597760|5.0|I just finished The Misremembered Man. Once started, I could not put it down. The story is spellbinding in its depiction of rural Ireland between the 30s and the 70s.  The parallel lives of the characters is interesting and the writer is skillful in unfolding their similar histories. Although dark in many parts, as the storyline pulls the reader into the harsh realities of orphans and oppression, this reader needed to find our more and more. If you liked Angela's Ashes or novels by Catherine Cookson, you will enjoy this book. It is heart wrenching, intriguing, full of colorful characters and the end is satisfying, although it has a surprise.   This novel made me long for a sequel to it!

B000065KH4|5.0|Ever question religion and religiousity and why many individuals whom enter the church gates appear with no color, drone and lacking life? It befuddles me. Then there is Chocolat with a woman's touch; she (Juliette Binoche) spins the wheel and asks, \\"What do you see?\\" Always guessing a person's favorite chocolate. I remember the song's lyric from the movie Hunchback of Notre Dame, \\"Who is the monster and who is the man?\\" When Serge an abusive husband boycotts the \\"river rats\\" as Rue (Johnny Depp)brings a child with an upset stomach in need of a drink to his bar. This movie is not far off from the truth with religious folk and those who are different. Chocolat has a spectacular cast including Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Carrie-Anne Moss and Lena Olin.
B002VNFNTC|5.0|First of all, this was for me, the best Bukowski book I have read. I haven´t read much, only those mostly mainstream.  It is not easy to compare writers, and in the end all it comes to personal taste. I am not an experienced reader, far from that, but I do tend to read most of the \\"know classics\\" that circulate around. And, at the moment, Bukowski is by far my favourite writer. His style of prose just flows and it´s so easy to read. He uses such simple words, in such a subtle way, that makes reading enjoyable.  I strongly recommend this book for people who don´t like to read. This book got me the love for reading!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I just finished this novel, and I was not dissatisfied!  Although a long book, I zoomed though it, and at the risk of using an old phrase, I could not put in down!  This story is different from Kings usual horror stuff, but it was excellent!  If you like time travel concepts and history, you will enjoy this read!!

B001GCUO4S|1.0|I hated this movie. I'm a huge fan of the previous \\"Final Destinations\\" but this was a sad installment. All the characters looked alike and you couldn't tell them apart. They had no personal growth or development to make the viewer feel bad when they finally got sliced and diced. Some of the deaths were lame. The 3-D wasn't even that good with the cheap pair of red and blue plastic 3-D glasses that come in the case. I wanted to stab myself after watching this movie because I wasted $25 bucks on it. It went into the declined movie collection in my deep dark basement where it belongs and I'm sad it's not sitting with the other 3 on my shelve. Overall, avoid this mess.

B004EPZ08Y|5.0|I saw this in 3-D in theaters and it was awesome! This was 500% better than the God-awful \\"The Final Destination\\" which I threw across the floor after watching because it was terrible on so many levels! This one brought life back into the franchise with a breath of fresh air. If you liked the first 3 (and maybe the 4th) than you will no doubt love this one too if not more! I especially loved the ending and how it... well I won't spoil anything...
B000LYY2OA|5.0|This album debut and mark the first journey of Iron maiden towards its heavy metal sound and career. Its sound and riffs are flawless and captivating that can still be felt today. I've keep this album sealed for so long that it will have a great collector's value in the future too.

B0036S4C6G|4.0|In form, \\"A Visit from the Good Squad\\" occupies a twilight zone between a novel and a collection of short stories.  Each \\"chapter\\" in the book features central characters who are minor character in other chapters.  They collide with each other at various points in their lives like bumper cars, with unpredictable results.  Much is revealed about the processes of aging and of reconciling (or failing to reconcile) youthful actions and attitudes with their consequences over lifetimes.  Egan's use of language and imagery is excellent and engrossing. I thoroughly enjoyed the writing even when I got a little lost in the complexities of the interconnecting stories.  When I finished the book, I immediately began to re-read it because I wanted to reconstruct and remember how the characters affected one another.  I was surprised to find that I enjoyed the book even more in the re-reading than in the initial reading.  I definitely recommend it, especially for readers with a general interest in the rock-and-roll milieu (specifically in New York and San Francisco) and the evolution of the rock music industry in the past several decades.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|As others have said I too am surprised at the reviews. I actually bought two other, more expensive, covers. One a zippered case was hard to use. The second was a \\"leather\\" case that probabbly wouldn't last that long. Besides, the overlapping cover, that went over the screen, actually interfered with operations. This one is light and sturdy, more so than the other covers. I thought the elastic strap to hold the cover open or  closed was kind of tacky, but not as bad as I thought, and is actually pretty practical. My only concern is how long the elastic will last. Maybe a velcro strap would work better, but maybe not. In any event, this cover is well worth the price and out performs more expensive covers. Watch the video on the product page. The gentleman tells the truth and it is exactly as advertised. Don't waste your money. Buy this one!!!

0385535139|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's novels, and this is definitely one of my favorites.  Early in his career, his stories were full of the naive hope and dreams of a man in love with the legal profession.  There were heroes and villains, and in the end the heroes always emerged victorious.  The last decade showed the signs of a man who had become cynical with the world around him.  They were dark tales filled with selfish, terrible people.  There was always a good guy or two, but they were no match for the entrenched power seized by the bullies of the world.  This book begins a whole new chapter of Grisham novels.  It combines the cynicism of an experienced man distraught with the world around him, with the optimism of a young man that believes one man can make the world a better place.  It isn't a flashy crime drama like The Firm or The Client, nor does it have the perfect protagonist like A Time to Kill.  It's more realistic, and that's why I love it.  The villains aren't all bad, and the heroes aren't all good.  Just like you and I, the people all have flaws, and all show signs of promise.  The book ends on a much more positive note than one might expect based on his recent novels, but not quite the ridiculous happily ever after conclusion written into his earlier works.  I find The Litigators to be an inspiring account that shows both how great and how bad lawyers and the legal system can be.
0553386794|5.0|I was turned on to these books by the HBO show.  If you like LOTR don't read these! This series is seedy, dark, bloody r-rated type material.  I loved this book.  Each chapter is written from a different character's point of view.  This makes things interesting, because you think, \\"oh these are the good guys.\\"  Then everything changes when you read from the other character's perspective.  There are no hero's coming in to save the day.  This is war.  It's politics.  It's literally a game of thrones, and no one is safe.
B005DOKL3E|2.0|I bought the Kindle Fire for a Christmas gift and I purchased the green sleeve to go with it.  I love the Kindle but the sleeve is absolutely not worth $29.99 dollars.

B004NSULHM|5.0|First off, I've really gotten into Radiohead over this last year.  I love everything from The Bends up to now.  Radiohead changes their sound every album, and as a fan, I am always anxious to hear what they've mastered next.  The King of Limbs was disappointing at first listen to be honest. After each listen I've liked it more and more as I find and seek what I've missed before, and I really like the album now. The album is not like any other Radiohead album.  It has a distinct airy, light atmosphere despite all the percussion.  The music is very percussion oriented, but in a very precise, technical way. Don't expect a lot of guitar, or any 'rocking' tracks.  If you like the album, I recommend checking out radiohead's youtube channel to hear all the remixes from the album--there are a lot of good ones!
0375826726|1.0|I was impressed by Paolini's first book, \\"Eragon.\\" It wasn't the greatest book ever and was little more than fantasy (instead of sci-fi) \\"Star Wars,\\" but for a kid writing, it was well done. When \\"Eldest\\" came out, I was excited to see how Paolini had grown as a writer. Although the book was an OK follow-up to the first, I wrote it off as just suffering from the usual middle book syndrome that one often sees in a series. Therefore, I remained hopeful that \\"Brisingr\\" would prove to be a solid book. Alas, Paolini is still writing like a teenager rather than maturing as an author. The only difference was a tremendous amount of purple prose and a ridiculous amount of whining from the main character. As a result, I made it only half way through this book before being so disgusted that I set it aside.  My recommendation is to read and enjoy \\"Eragon\\" and then avoid Paolini's subsequent work.
0385534639|5.0|There are many eloquent reviews written here for The Night Circus both in favor, and not in favor, so I am not going to go into any great detail regarding the plot of the book. But having read both positive and negative reviews I would like to respond to the negative, and give my take on supposedly \\"flat\\" or \\"underdeveloped\\" characters, and why I completely disagree;<br /><br />  This book is called The Night Circus, not Celia & Marco, the Circus itself and the magic and mystery that surround it are the main character, everyone else is a player on the grand stage that is set before us. In my opinion the criticism is directed towards the very thing that makes the book magical, the narrative and storytelling are descriptive and paint a tapestry of visuals, smells, sounds, atmospheres, and people, rather than delving deep into the minds of the individual characters. The narrative itself unfolds like a magic trick, withholding just enough as to not reveal too much lest it lose it's enchantment. I think it is every bit as delicate an art in what is NOT said as much as what IS said. After all if we knew too much detail about a magician it would take away the aura of mystery. The style of the storytelling was what made the book enchanting and utterly captivating, and if the writer had taken the road most traveled and gave us in depth character narrative and thought processes it would have RUINED the book. The Night Circus is like a dream, an enchanted magical journey, you can almost hear the tinkling of a music box playing in the background as you read about the tale of two magicians, and the backdrop of the mysterious Night Circus.<br /><br />  Since we were children it seems we have always been captivated by the world of the circus or magicians, and it is the aura of mystery surrounding them that keeps us in wonder. This is what The Night Circus is able to capture, it's purpose is not (say), to show us the \\"gritty underbelly beneath the big top\\", but instead to lead us on a dancing path of moonlight, to have us float in the mist with our feet off the ground, never to quite touch down. I felt while reading it that I was caught up in the enchantment, and that I was a participant in the mysteriousness rather than being too much \\"in the know\\", and I wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />  Now regarding the relationship between the two main characters; it makes perfect sense how you could have an opponent who is your equal and opposite match in every way, move for move, intrigue for intrigue, become attractive to you. Just the fact that the two are caught up in a game that only they understand, and the fact that their intellect would at first frustrate and infuriate each other, but slowly become intriguing, then attracting, makes sense.<br /><br /> So I appreciate the telling of this tale as much as the tale itself, and the sleight of hand as much as the cards that are played. This is one of those rare books that I know I will reread again and again for years to come.<br /><br />(p.s., forgive my overuse of the words \\"magical\\", \\"mysterious\\" and \\"enchanted\\", but sometimes we overuse a word when no other will suffice).h of moonlight, to have us float in the mist with our feet off the ground, never to quite touch down.

B0061JPYX2|5.0|Wow! I just bought this CD yesterday. It's truly fantastic! Amy Winehouse is one of the FEW BEST artists of the 21st century. Her voice and music is sooo amazing that she links this generation with previous generations, as she refreshes and gives classic jazz (i.e., Billie Holliday) and Motown music (i.e., The Shirelles) a new addictive sound! She undoubtedly merits the title of rare talent because she could transcend musical genre boundaries. She could sing jazz, blues, ska, reggae, big band, burlesque, R&B, bossa nova, calypso, and who knows what else had she been fortunate enough to remain with us!   Amy--you will be soooo missed. You were that single artist that made listening to music after the 90s possible again!   I love ALL her songs, but the very best, in my opinion, are:  1. Our day will come  2. Between the cheats  3. Will you still love me tomorrow?  4. The girl from Ipanema  5. Best friends, right?  6. Body and Soul  7. A Song for you

B005FNGAD8|5.0|As Music Director of WMMR in 1972, I booked, produced and mixed this Billy Joel Sigma Sound Show.  I was pretty sure \\"Captain Jack\\" was a hit the night of live broadcast.  I became convinced when my mother, who was listening at home, called to say she didn't like that song about the suburban kids, especially the masturbate part and the mother makes your bed part.  BINGO! SUBURBAN TEENAGE ANGST!  The fixed drum flub is actually a relief to me -- it's been driving me crazy ever since then.  I am sad old friend Ed Sciaky, the WMMR DJ extraordinaire who announced the show, did not live to see this concert released officially. And I wish my mother was around to finally know this epic musical evening has reached the public, and I was at last credited by Sony/Columbia/Legacy.

0307388719|5.0|Winston Churchill was larger than life--a great man perhaps the greatest political leader the world has ever known.  Max Hastings, noted World War II chronicler, delves into the topic with all the determination and gusto displayed by his subject.  Churchill emerges as a much more likable human being than his counterpart in the U.S., Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Although Churchill has his faults, notably his impulsiveness in military matters, his overall presence on the World War II stage ultimately supercedes them.  Churchill displayed strength of will and communicated this to the world.  His was the voice the generation of the second world war always heard cajoling, pleading, defiant in the face of Nazi threats.    Churchill emerged from the war exhausted and penniless rejected by the British people.  He lived to be 90, once again serving as prime minister after writing his history of World War II.    This book is a worthy addition to the many which have been written about Winston Churchill.

B0034G4P4Y|5.0|As a half-Belgian, I grew up on Herge's work of Tintin and loved it immensely.  I still have the books that I originally collected back in the 80's.  About a year ago, I began reading the Tintin books to my own daughter who has been completely hooked.  Then, we learned that Spielberg/Jackson were heading up the effort to bring this to the silver screen.  So, when I heard that Spielberg and Jackson were on the job, I felt that the project was on track to begin with (Spielberg having bought rights to make the movie back in 1984!).  After having seen it, I couldn't imagine how much better a Tintin movie might have played out, nor who could have played the characters better.  Everyone was perfectly chosen and no one felt out of place...ever.  For those of you unfamiliar with Tintin, what are you in for?  Well, to sum it up briefly, Tintin is a young, intrepid reporter who has an insatiable thirst for adventure and need to solve mysteries along with his white, wily dog Snowy (or \\"Milou\\" in the original Belgian version) who is never far away from his master's side.  Other characters in Tintin's universe include the bumbling detectives, Thompson and Thomson (one with a \\"p\\", the other without).  Captain Haddock, from the original comic series, is a hopeless drunk ready with a quick lash of his nonsensical oaths (\\"blistering blue barnacles and ten thousand thundering typhoons!\\") and even quicker with a bottle of whiskey, often to amusing effect.  *minor spoilers in the next paragraph*  In this movie, Tintin comes across an exquisite replica of a 16th Century ship called the Unicorn.  Straight off the bat, the ship is sought after by multiple men who try to relieve Tintin of his purchase at a flea market with cash.  Sure enough, Tintin soon becomes embroiled in a mystery that has been buried in the past regarding the ship's secret cargo.  The nature of this mystery has supposedly been passed down through to the last surviving heir who happens to be Haddock himself.  What follows is a race to decode a cryptic message left in the boat in Tintin's possession.  It's a breakneck, fantastic adventure involving danger on high seas, a fantastic aerial sequence, deserts, Moroccan palaces, and Europe itself (albeit a fairly non-descript one that suggests that Tintin is of English origin) ultimately culminating in solving the riddle behind the Unicorn and a revelation of Haddock's past.  For those of you who are familiar with Tintin already, how is the treatment of the source material?  I would say that it's fairly decent although bringing such a story to the silver screen does require changes.  The movie touches on elements of the \\"Secret Of The Unicorn,\\" \\"Red Rackham's Treasure,\\" and \\"The Crab With The Golden Claws.\\"  For the sake of brevity, the pace of the story and the whole Calculus/submarine storyline were abandoned in favor of a plot that moves very quickly.  However, elements that closely parallel the original stories (including the moment where Tintin hilariously interrupts Haddock who attempts to incorporate a swig of whiskey during a historical flashback), are handled with exquisitely painstaking detail and you can tell that Tintin afficianados were involved from start-to-finish; this is not a mere cash-grab.  In fact, the opening credits feature a vignette that is reminiscent of Herge's original artwork.  Also, a quick look around Tintin's apartment shows newspaper articles that depict many of his other adventures from other books.  Other touches include a cameo from Herge himself (who has been dead since 1983) as he sketches up Tintin at the flea market, revealing a portrait that is a perfect replica of Tintin from the comics.  For a true Tintin nostalgic fan, all of these touches are brief, but a delightful nod for those of us who remember.  As for the motion capture and rendering of the movie itself?  Simply astounding.  I always thought that Polar Express was beautiful, but there was something about the characters' eyes that gaveme the \\"is there anyone in there\\" sensation.  In this movie, however, everyone looks very much alive and the eyes really betray the emotions of how everyone is feeling.  Even the detail of Haddock's spray of explosive saliva as he grates, \\"No one takes my SHIP!\\" is a jaw-dropping experience.  The ocean water looks extremely real and it's hard to believe that I'm watching an animated feature most of the time.  The 3D effects - for those of you who are into it - are really done quite well, but I know that it's not everyone's cup of tea.  However, the luminosity issues that plague most 3D movies don't hurt Tintin noticeably; even dark scenes provide extremely good contrast for a great viewing experience.  Colors are extremely vibrant and pop even with the 3D glasses.  The 2D version looks just as good without the 3D effect...yes, I've seen it twice - I told you that I'm a fan.  As for parents, I would say not to take the PG rating too lightly.  Haddock is a drunk, so there is consumption of alcohol but often to humorous effect; however, if that sort of thing offends you, you've been warned.  The bad guys also have no qualms at shooting at Tintin, Haddock, and Snowy either...although our trio is not afraid to dish it back either.  There is very little blood, but a character does die revealing a blood-spattered newspaper (not excessive, but enough to give you the idea that the fellow isn't doing too well).  I took my 8-year old daughter to go see it and she handled it just fine; a lot of the same elements that you see in the movie are in the books as well, so she was already prepared for everything that she was about to see.  I applaud Spielberg for his work on this film.  It certainly threw me back 30 years to my own childhood and I enjoyed the movie immensely.  The ending of the movie certainly suggest that more could be on the horizon.  My only fear, however, is that despite having sold 350 million books, Herge's work is not as widely known in the United States...I can only hope that it does well enough as well as it has overseas thus far to warrant another release.  My daughter and I will eagerly be in that line should it ever occur.

B005PK5C12|4.0|Any show which casts Jessica Lange is right away doing something right.  She becomes yet another of the very best film actors to make the transition to the small screen.  Even better, she is not playing some goody two shoes in this ghost filled series.  No, she lives next door to the Murder House in Los Angeles, in which an amazing amount of ghosts have taken up residence over the decades after a botched experience of trying to live in the house while still living. Charlotte (Lange) is tied to this house and all of the ghosts in it although we only discover this in layers and not even entirely in this first season.<br /><br />The first season involves yet another family taking up residence in the house, a husband, wife and teen daughter.  The husband is a psychiatrist who practices from home.  He is so clueless that he can't tell the difference if his new patient is a ghost or not! This was one of the more humorous aspects to the series. Charlotte becomes very involved in their lives as does a housekeeper ghost, played by Frances Conroy of SIX FEET UNDER.<br /><br />There are still some rough edges to the show.  It can't quite make up its mind on which characters to emphasize but is getting a handle on that aspect as each episode unfolds.  At first one is just overwhelmed with characters, both living and dead.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B005PYZG6E|3.0|When you compare this to other camera stabilizing products out there, you'll see this one is very inexpensive.  When I took it out of the box I was reminded that I chose the cheap competitor.  You essentially need two things with a stabilizer:  a gymbal to allow the system to move, and the ability to balance the system so it won't wiggle and tilt.  This product has problems with both of these:  The gymbal:  The gymbal on this product is not super-smooth, it drags.  A good quality gymbal will allow the system to spin for a long time before eventually slowing it to a stop.  This gymbal allowed the product to spin less than one turn when I tried it.  That's a lot of drag.  This means the camera will be turning everywhere my hand turns.  Also, the handle has about 10 degrees of movement in any direction before it hits the housing.  So the handle must be held pretty much straight up.  Balancing:  Balancing is very limited.  There is no left-right adjustment on the camera mount.  There is one weight provided, about two pounds, that you can slide up and down along the midline.  If your camera is not two pounds, you'll have to use something else to balance your camera.  Luckily the weight is easily removed.  A bolt, wing-nut and washers may do the trick.  Mark the position your camera is in once you have it in balance so that you can save balancing time next time you attach it.  Pros:  1. It feels very solid, and with some tinkering and good luck, it can be balanced.  Tinker with the weight, and be patient.  2. The price is very low.  And so:  It will never give you the super-smooth shots we see on youtube where the cameraman is running but the camera is getting smooth shots.  But, the price is very low and they don't say you get what you pay for, for nothing.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|And about time too. I have been listening to Aqualung for 40 years, initially the original vinyl version and later various CD and vinyl re-releases including heavy vinyl. The original sound sticks in the mind, although from a cheap record player. Over time, the vinyl got old and one listened to the CD, which sounded muddy and grated on the ears. Still, I had to make do, given one's love for the music, which to me was a milestone.  At first, I hesitated to go out and buy another (the 40th Anniversary)remaster (CD has rarely impressed, except with Transports and DACs now available). In the end, I was persuaded by a friend (another Tull fan) and was I rewarded! For the first time I was astonished to hear the clarity of sound on CD. This remastered version is a departure from previous versions and helps to refresh and refurbish Aqualung as we knew /heard it all those years ago. The 40 years' wait has been worth it! Most people remember Aqualung for the title song and Locomotive Breath. While they are iconic and memorable giving Martin Barre a somewhat free rein, I have always enjoyed the acoustic Cheap Day return, Wondring Aloud and Slipstream, all of which sound beautiful on this remaster. Am tempted to get the remastered vinyl now....
1439102732|5.0|I have read all of Jodie Picoult's books and with the exception of one, enjoyed them all.  I had been putting off reading this one because I didn't think I would enjoy the subject matter.  However, I have just this minute finished reading it and have to say I couldn't put it down.  The various subject matters were of great interest -religiously, sexually and of course emotionally.  I really got to know the characters well and in spite of the fact that Max appeared to be a weak character because he chose to leave Zoe at such an awful time in their lives, I felt great sympathy for him because he felt he had let her down so badly after so many years of IVF and having supported her so much during the past nine years.  The twist at the end of the story was great -I had no idea which way it would go.
B0000042MY|5.0|I had forgotten just how beautiful the soundtrack to this movie is. It captures the essence of the story, love and loss.
B005H0IW6W|2.0|I don't want to bash Buble--I am a fan and really enjoy his big band supper club style--but this album is a snooze.  His voice is good, of course, but the only two numbers that are any fun are \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" and \\"Jingle Bells\\" because both arrangements sparkle in a Nelson Riddle style.  Very fun.  But the duet with Shania Twain is just plain awful.  Their styles don't blend, and their voices seem to be fighting for attention.  It's bad.  The \\"Feliz Navidad\\" duet with Thalia (who?) is just boring.  In fact, most of the album is either boring and/or treacly sweet (\\"Silent Night\\").   (And don't even get me started on the goofiness of having Justin Bieber on his Christmas special.  It was so bad I kept watching just for the laughs.)  Pick and choose a few numbers to download and leave it at that.
B002GU5V24|5.0|Other reviewers have already gone over intricate details of this box set, so I will spare you a lengthy review. I was mainly interested in the Seonds Out remix. The other albums sound ok; not much improvement over the previous mixes. Now on to Seconds Out:<br /><br />This remix sounds almost like a completely different album! The vocals and drums have been greatly enhanced, but the keyboards have been diminished in some places. When I listened to this version of Squonk, I was blown away! I always thought Seconds Out had sounded like the most studio of any live album I ever heard. This mix gives more of a live feel to the album. The ARP pro soloist synth sounds more like it should (i.e. a little more raw). I did not encounter the track problems that other people had. Perhaps they fixed them; I wouldn't know since I ripped them to my ipod at 320 mps AAC. I will still keep my old versions because they have their charm too.<br /><br />Unless you're a die-hard Genesis fan, I would not recommend paying this high price for this box set.

0385534639|5.0|Imagine a circus - not a usual one, but a magical one all in black and white that is open only at night. This circus has illusionists, contortionists and acrobats, but it also has clockwork animals made of paper, wishing trees, ice rooms, and a room full of bottles containing smells and sensations. Imagine a deadly game is being played on the grounds of this circus, and that the two contestants must each compete without knowing the other's identity.  I am really not doing the book justice in my description, but you get the idea. I loved this book. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of it, and was highly amused that bits of it were inspired by the Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab website. Some other reviewers have complained about all the descriptions in the book, but I found the descriptions very lyrical and necessary to the tone and atmosphere of the book. Gorgeously well-written (unlike my review). Wow. Just wow. Five zombie thumbs up!

B005OMU5U4|5.0|Normally I hate it, when artists that bring 'another' expanded edition to the market, while you have already 1/3th of the material of such an expansion. But with this Moby set, it is OK, as the additional work is just another Moby master piece: just listen, and relax! I love this kind of music while sitting for hours and hours (Manila - Amsterdam is about 14 hours) in the airplane!
0062060554|5.0|This book was given to me as a christmas gift from my boss. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. It is beautifully written and really draws you into the character. Makes you feel like your right there with her inside her mind. I love this book...and would recomend it to anyone.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|The Blu-Ray version of this movie is absolutely fantastic. I enjoyed the singing and Adele talking to the crowd. Now this part is also something that if you have children you need to be completely aware of. This is by no means a clean release. There is quite a bit of foul language in the show. My kids love Adele and were really excited to watch this and within the first 2 minutes of the show Adele shouts out \\"Royal F****** Albert Hall\\" I was a little bit surprised and began to get a little worried. Now the rest of the show was filled with lots of \\"f\\" bombs and various other colorful language. My advice to anyone who has bought this or is interested in buying this to watch with their children is to buy the cd/dvd version which has the edited version of the show. Now that being said if you simply must have the Blu-Ray release, you can pick each song individually from the menu to watch it and it will skip all of the talking leading up to the song and you should be able to navigate your way around the cussing. The included cd is clean though so no worries on that front. All in all this is a great release that comes highly recommended but just beware if there are little Adele fans in your home
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|As suave, handsome and debonair as Cary Grant, to whom he is often compared, George Clooney could have coasted on his looks and charm and still made a successful movie career. He's never been interested in taking the easy way out, however. In his latest film, \\"The Descendants,\\" he plays a troubled lawyer in Paradise, that is, Hawai'i. (One of the many pleasures of \\"The Descendants\\" is the pervasive but never intrusive presence, through scenery and music, of the distinctive culture of the state.)<br /><br />Matt King is not your everyday attorney--he is a descendant of one of the island state's oldest and richest families, and the trustee of the family estate on Kaua'i, overseeing an impending sale that will make his and all of his numerous relatives' fortunes. In the meantime his personal life is falling apart--his wife Elizabeth is in a coma after a boating accident, and his two daughters, to whom he has, by his own admission, been \\"the understudy--the backup parent,\\" are both acting out in reaction to the tragedy. As he tries to hold his family together, Matt is further buffeted by revelations concerning his troubled marriage and its wholly unexpected effect on the upcoming business deal.<br /><br />Directed by Anthony Payne, who helmed the sleeper \\"Sideways\\" a few years back, \\"The Descendants\\" possesses the same knack for drawing easy laughs from the viewer, then delivering sucker punches of emotion just when one's defenses are down. Clooney catches the look of old Hawaiian money to perfection, his handsome visage weathered and weary, stumping around in shorts and aloha shirts. He delivers a memorable performance both facially, in a quiet private speech to his unhearing wife, and physically, in a burst of angry speed as he runs to confront friends who have withheld crucial information from him. However fine the actor is (and the award nominations are already rolling in), he is only the primary player in a strong cast. Shailene Woodley matches him scene for scene as his tense, wary elder daughter Alex, and veteran actors Beau Bridges, Robert Forster, and Michael Ontkean (how long since we've seen him?) turn up, comfortable as old shoes, in subsidiary roles. More prominently, Judy Greer and Matthew Lillard deliver sterling performances as a couple whose lives end up colliding with Matt's.<br /><br />\\"The Descendants\\" is not a flawless piece of film making--there is a lot of exposition supplied via voice-over narration, and even so there is not enough backstory supplied about either Matt's and Elizabeth's marriage or the business deal that forms the backdrop against which the personal story unfolds. Early on, Alex gains a male friend (not a boyfriend), Sid (Nick Krause), whose presence is ultimately justified in a rather contrived, though admittedly touching, fashion. Still, the loose ends confirm one of the film's themes--that there is a lot in life that is left unsaid, sometimes until it's too late. Highly recommended.lder daughter Alex, and veteran actors Beau Bridges, Robert Forster, and Michael Ontkean (how long since we've seen him?) turn up, comfortable as old shoes, in subsidiary roles.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|4.7 stars<br /><br />It's a good sign when you're two hours into a film and wishing it would go on another two. Pitt carries this one so well that it's just a pleasure watching him work, and the script is what lets him be this good.<br /><br />Everything is measured yet compelling, and every bit role is cast and played perfectly. Some movies just feel good from front to back, and Moneyball is in that league. Then again, I love baseball, so maybe I'm biased, but I'd put this one up there with Bang The Drum Slowly and Bull Durham.<br /><br />It was a great real-life story, and so many details are caught just right in this exemplary screenplay. The score has moments of real beauty, and the heavy drama during the 20th win is played to the hilt while the music says it all. It's a treat to see a movie round the bases this convincingly.<br /><br />The box score says that Moneyball is a great baseball movie.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I own all 6 seaons on DVD and absolutely loved the first movie. In fact I was able to watch the first movie mutliple times. I was so stoked for the second movie to be released. After seeing it I was beyond disapointed. There was no plot, I barely laughed and the girls looked pretty silly in all the over done outfits. I really wanted to like it since I am such a die hard fan but could not bring myself to find any redeeming qualities about the film. I can't even stomach to watch it a second time EVER. If they ever plan on a third one they have a lot of making up to do. Please don't waste your time or money on this one. You are much better off getting the orginal seaons that were on HBO or the first movie.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|One of my friends has the ipad 2 and one of those fancy smart covers you see advertised at every bestbuy and apple store.  His is simple; it attaches magnetically to the side and covers the screen with a nice foldable polyurethane cover.  Its exactly what I wanted when I got my kindle fire.  I was lucky enough to find something better.  This offers the same foldable cover, but it is attached to a polycarbonate backing, which protects all sides and angles of the fire.  Its lightweight, and hardly adds any girth or weight to the fire.  Its literally the perfect case.  I dont understand the negative reviews.  If you want a streamlined, protective, sleek looking case, look no further.

B0054YH8DY|5.0|BOOKENDS (released in 1968) is the greatest of all Simon & Garfunkel albums, and one of the best records made in the 1960s.<br /><br />When this review was first published on the night of 12/25/06, I'd been pondering Christmas of 1968. I was 14 back then. It was an awful year to live through for anyone, especially a kid. The Vietnam War, the assassination of public figures, and seeing part of my city burn the previous summer during riots; it was a lot to handle.<br /><br />The song \\"Save The Life Of My Child\\" from BOOKENDS was in my head during most of 1968. I identified with that frightened boy standing on the ledge, while a crowd below urged him to jump. His final thought as \\"he flew away\\" was \\"...I got no hiding place.\\" That was exactly how I felt in those dark days.<br /><br />What a powerful and unforgettable way to begin an album. The moods of BOOKENDS reflect so well the troubled times of the late '60s, with its anti-war sentiments (Punky's Dilemma), and its tales of love and love lost (America, Overs). The original first side of the record ends with the sad longing and fears of Old Friends, who sit on a park bench and reminisce together. But this bittersweet song has a deeper message. These old men were survivors-- if they were supposed to be elderly in 1968, then they made it through the Depression, and two world wars, and if they were the youth of 1968 projected into the future, well they too made it through trials by fire.<br /><br />And so have I made it through! I'm in my late 50s now and headed for that park bench one day. The fears and sadness of 1968 are long past, but a final memory remains:<br /><br />As I lay in bed early that Christmas Eve, the colored glow of tree lights seeped into my room. Off in the distance were disembodied television voices of Apollo astronauts circling the moon-- they read a passage from the book of Genesis, and wished well the \\"people of the good Earth.\\" It was a peaceful and hopeful ending to a terrible year.<br /><br />Very few albums truly encapsulate a moment in time. Even fewer connect deeply with listeners in ways they may not realize until decades into the future. Simon & Garfunkel's BOOKENDS is one of those rare examples. It is paradoxically timeless and a reflection of its time.Very few albums truly encapsulate a moment in time.

B0000T6JH4|2.0|LET IT BE - NAKED is a totally unnecessary album. The additional disc of studio chatter is a massive bore-- please don't waste a portion of your life listening to it.<br /><br />The original album, in spite of a few Spector overdubbed tracks, is just fine and about all one needs to hear from this ill-fated movie and concert project.<br /><br />Speaking of which, if Apple really cares about Beatles fans young and old (which I doubt), they should re-release the film of LET IT BE-- give it a short theatrical run, then follow that up with a home video product. LET IT BE is certainly not the greatest rock movie of all time, but it has a few fine moments. This movie is the REAL Let It Be Naked.
0226264211|5.0|This is a great book exposing how freedom is promoted by the free market. Outlines steps that can be taken to make the U.S. more free. However this book assumes basic micro/macro knowledge.<br /><br />Every educated American should read this book
B005LAJ16I|3.0|Note: I've only seen the first episode of this series with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />I only saw the pilot episode of this series because I read that Alex Cary, an executive producer of this show, has been hired to write a script for an updated reboot of the classic TV drama Wiseguy which aired from 1987-1990 and starred Ken Wahl for three of its four seasons, and I wanted to see what he's capable of. It's a great premise, but as with BOSS, it's way too modern for my taste. It would be more palatable if it was set in the 1940's or something. I have no problem with the sex/nudity; hey, it's good. But it just hits too close to home. Homegrown terrorists? Really...We watch TV to escape from the horrors of the real world. Homeland just brings the real world into the television world. I can only hope that the planned reboot of Wiseguy goes something like CBS' excellent reboot of Hawaii Five-0. with an origin story and that it stays faithful to the original series starring Ken Wahl. Maybe if the script is in line with the original series, bring in either Ken Wahl or Jonathan Banks for a cameo or supporting role.

B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I, like many others, was pleased with this case to begin with. It seemed to be high quality. I loved the rubberized exterior, the sleek design, etc. However, after one month of very light use, it has not held up. The rubberized exterior is beginning to come off in several places, exposing the hard black surface underneath. It is very unattractive-looking. After attempting to cope with this problem, it has only gotten worse, forcing me to remove my Kindle and discard the case altogether. I suspect that others will find this to be a problem, as well, and would not recommend this case as a result.

B005DI65L2|5.0|I'll never look at my dog the same way again, after reading this wonderful book about how dogs think and what makes them do what they do ... the author uses her own research and the research of other scientists to explain what dogs think, how they respond and why you can't expect them to act like people ... early on, she suggests getting down on hands and knees and looking at the world from your dog's point of view ... Shiner looked like he thought I was crazy (he doesn't think that way, by the by) and I even followed her advice and smelled things at that level ... fascinating ... in places a little dry, but you'll never learn more about what goes on in your dog's head than you will in this volume.
B004222UCS|4.0|I have to admit that as a teenager I knew no other Sabbath but the Ozzy era. The only other that i had even heard was a friends copy of Headless Cross. I have slowly been discovering all the other eras. 1st the Dio era,then the Tony Martin era and now this album. I know it's only Sabbath by force of the record company but this album is fantastic. Glenn Hughes vocals are amazing and it makes me want to explore more stuff with him. The second disc although basically a bootleg if you can get past the hissing isn't as bad as other reviewers claim.

1451627289|5.0|I rated this as Steven king's best book ever. For me, this was a genuine page-turner. I couldn't wait to see how it all ended, yet I didn't want it to end. It was extremely well written and thought out. It is the type of book that stays with you long after you have read it, and will lead to discussions of various viewpoints among its readers about what the main character did, could have done, or should have done. For my money, Mr. King has surpassed \\"The Stand\\", which up until now was his best effort.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Definitely one of Allen's best and I especially like his work when he doesn't star.  The actor that shines is Marion Cotillard, followed by Alison Pill as Zelda Fitzgerald.  The movie is filled with deceased & beloved literary, musical,and visuals artists that flow through the picture in a creative style.  Owen Wilson gives a decent performance and although leans on the side of neurosis, he doesn't go too far as Allen has often portrayed.  The movie is realistically shot as it travels through moments in history, including period enhancements through the set designs.  It's fun, it's refreshing, it's 5 stars.
B001AQT0RC|4.0|Great movie, if you haven't seen it already.  The HD quality is pretty good, but the supplements on this Blu-ray disc aren't very comprehensive (certainly nothing new added since the old DVD).  Menu design is bland, but if you can get this movie when it's on sale, then I'd say it's definitely worth it if you're a fan.

B003AQBYUG|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3STACOUCTJ30B]]This was an amazing find for me!  The exact same discs as the U.S. version of the Alien Anthology, but at less than half the price!  This is an import set, but the discs are region-free and should play on any Blu-ray player.  They worked without error on my Panasonic DMP-BD60 player.  The only thing that is worth knowing, and not mentioned in the product description, is that the packaging is very different than the U.S. version.  The product I received was packaged with a slip cover (not very sturdy, but still has the glossy/reflective finish) and the actual blu-ray case is identical to the early seasons of LOST blu-rays.  The discs are housed securely, and I am not upset with the package design.  Just thought it was worth a mention since some people want the best packaging and are willing to pay for it.  To me, the extra money was not worth it.  This is a great deal as is.
B003L77FYS|3.0|Though the 3rd season of the show isn't my favourite the DVD is definitely better than the one of the 2nd Season. There are more extras than previously, I'm glad both with the bloopers and the missing scenes. I have two complaints: first, there are no BD edition, and second I miss the audio commentaries from the main cast very much. In the age of digital distribution buying any kind of solid media is the expression of devotion - ABC should respect these viewers more providing really rich extra content and quality.

B001R4MEUM|5.0|The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is the single greatest accomplishment of progressive rock. The only way to review it is to do it in 4 sides, because that's the way it was written. Peter Gabriel or the band never even got close to playing music like this again. They peaked in 1973, we just didn't know it at the time.<br /><br />Side One starts with the title track, one of their most famous songs. Cuts 4 and 5, \\"Cuckoo Coccon\\" and \\"In The Cage\\" are as good as it gets folks. The keyboards by Tony Banks on cage along with Phil Collins on drums: WOW. Brings me back to the first time I ever heard it and then I knew what music was supposed to sound like. \\"The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging\\" is an underrated song, Phil Collins is the best drummer in prog rock and proves it here.<br /><br />Side Two starts with \\"Back in NYC\\" and is the one song on this that I seen Peter perform live. \\"No time for romantic escape. When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No\\" Steve Hackett is featured on the \\"Hairless Heart\\" a great piece of music and it goes right into \\"Counting Out Time\\" a fun song that sounds like a lot of Peter songs to come. \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" and \\"The Chamber of 32 Doors\\" finish off side two in grand fashion. Two incredible songs both musically and vocally. This was a great side of an album and probably the worst of the 4. That's how good this masterpiece is.<br /><br />Side Three is the most progressive of the album and starts with \\"Lilywhite Lilith\\" and she gonna lead you right. A wonderful piece of music, with both Peter and Phil adding vocals. Every time I listen to this CD I am amazed at the skill of these musicians. Especially Phil Collins, this music is not possible without him, he is just so damn good. \\"The Waiting Room\\" is a strange number and one that CD reproduces better than vinyl or tape. \\"Anyway\\" and \\"The Supernatural Anaesthetist\\" keep the story moving and the side ends with the classic \\"The Lamia\\" one of the best songs ever written by Peter Gabriel, and then \\"Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats.\\"<br /><br />Side Four is my favorite side of the album and starts with \\"The Colony of Slippermen\\" my favorite song on the album. \\"Don't delay, dock the dick\\": Ouch! \\"Ravine\\" is another instrumental that features some nice acoustic guitar from Steve. \\"The Light Dies Down on Broadway\\" continues the title track, though Rael is now in a lot rougher shape. \\"Riding The Scree\\" has some great keyboards from Tony and great guitar work from Steve on \\"In the Rapids.\\" The last number is \\"It\\" with great guitar and vocals. \\"It is warm, just watch it grow.\\" It is great.<br /><br />Summary: This is it, the single greatest album in Progressive rock history. It is everything progressive music should be and when it came out it was one of a kind. There was nothing like it and it's never been topped. From the title track to \\"It.\\" There are a few weak instrumental parts that were used in the stage shows for Peter to change costumes. Even those are 5 star in my book. \\"It's only knock and knowall but I like it.\\"Empty Boats.\\"   Side Four is my favorite side of the album and starts with \\"The Colony of Slippermen\\" my favorite song on the album. \\"Don't delay, dock the dick\\": Ouch! \\"Ravine\\" is another instrumental that features some nice acoustic guitar from Steve. \\"The Light Dies Down on Broadway\\" continues the title track, though Rael is now in a lot rougher shape. \\"Riding The Scree\\" has some great keyboards from Tony and great guitar work from Steve on \\"In the Rapids.\\" The last number is \\"It\\" with great guitar and vocals. \\"It is warm, just watch it grow.\\" It is great.

1934356557|5.0|I particularly like the way that this book is laid out. The antipatterns are presented in related groups and the author starts by introducing each with a situation where the antipattern can cause a significant problem. The way that these are written is as if the author personally experienced each issue (which he may well have). Each is then followed by an explanation of why the particular problem occurred - the antipattern - and then one or more solutions are presented along with a discussion of where each solution may be appropriate and in some cases why you may decide to actually use the antipattern despite its limitations.<br /><br />The sorts of antipatterns the book deals with range from those that someone who understands normalisation wouldn't make in the first place through to some where the ideal solution very much depends on the circumstances and where even the antipattern may be the appropriate solution in some instances.<br /><br />The explanations of why each particular antipattern is a problem waiting to happen is clear and easy to follow and where an obvious solution exists it is clearly identified. Those situations where the solution depends on the exact circumstances have multiple solutions presented along with a discussion of when each would be appropriate.<br /><br />The book also exposes many of the myths that some people associate with databases such as those that suggest breaking up the data into a larger number of smaller tables (which is only really appropriate when there is a real reason for separating the data). Both of the contradictory myths about indexing - that indexing everything speeds up access and that having indexes at all slows things down - are both exposed as false with a discussion on how to add those indexes that are actually useful and omit those that are not.A lot of the mis-information about pseudokeys is also exposed.<br /><br />Just about everyone is going to experience one or more of these antipatterns in their work with relational databases and when you do the discussion of the particular antipattern in this book will give you a load of information to help you to resolve the issue.discussion of the particular antipattern in this book will give you a load of information to help you to resolve the issue.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Amazing. There is nothing else to say. It's Coldplay. There is nothing less to expect. Amazing CD. Amazing band. Amazing product.
B005V20JKI|5.0|This game took me by surprise at how much I've enjoyed it. The graphics are great, there's high replayability and the many characters have unique strategies which makes it all the more enjoyable.  It can take quite awhile to get enough muffins for 5 stars on every level, so if you're a collector you'll be in it for the long haul. If you're more of a casual gamer, you'll still have lots of fun. If you have trouble with the controls, the size and distance between buttons is adjustable in the Options menu.
0930289455|4.0|I've been a fan of Batman for as long as I can remember but only really via TV Shows, cartoons and movies.  I never really got into the monthly comic book scene and haven't picked up many superhero graphic novels.  But I've seen this graphic novel sitting on the store and library shelves for a long while and it kept calling to me...until I finally read it.  Of the Batman villains, my favorite is the Riddler.  Mostly this is due to my own penchant for riddles, puzzles, codes and random mind games.  However, close behind Riddler's methods of toying with Batman, my next favorite antagonist is the Joker.  Thus having the entire cover devoted to him, really made me eager to read this.  Add to that the writing of Alan Moore and I was stoked to get into this.  Apparently the original novel had much less color (mostly black and white, from what I understand) but the one I read was the \\"remastered\\" (that's the term for movies...does it apply to books?) version with cleaned up art and color.  I really enjoyed the art style.  It was a little greusome at times and there were a couple of scenes that I would have prefered a little less \\"graphic\\" in the graphic novel.  The story was very fast paced and the writing very tight.  Rather than the long back stories and explanations from something like Watchmen or V for Vendetta, this book just jumped right through all the hoops and presented the story with clean, concise movements that kept the plot jolting forward.  Probably my favorite part in the whole book was during the actual joke at the end.  The joke itself was alright, but having Batman give a half smirk really just cracked me up.  The stoic, withdrawn Batman who never reveals his humanity let himself emit a small sense of appreciation at the Joker's joke.  Not a laugh or a giggle...more just a slight exhale with even slighter motion at the corners of his lips, but enough to see Batman's humanity.  For Batman lovers, this is a fun book.  It's definitely not for kids (violence,language and covered/implied nudity) but for the more mature Batman crowd, this is an enjoying read.  ****  3.5 out of 5 stars
B0055Q5F36|1.0|The product itself is great but it didn't fit my phone although I have a Samsung Galaxy II.  My phone is through Sprint and apparently they changed things just enough so that covers bought at places other than Sprint won't fit.  Oh well, I tried!

B006AX6ONI|5.0|This book was a great motivational business book. Not only was it a business book but it also read like a conversation. I was very amused at the way this book flowed. I felt like I was sitting in the room with Mark Cuban and listening to him passionately inspire me as to how to build a successful business from the ground up.   Although many of the things he mentioned were things that are common in other similar books, he was able to add different personal stories and valuable touches to drive each lesson home. He was also very honest and humble. He was able to recognize when he made mistakes and wasn't perfect; somethign that many moguls don't often do.   Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to be motivated to be the best he can be. The underlining message I learned is that if you work hard, commit yourself to a business and focus then sky is the limit and you can become a highly successful businessman.   I hope Mark Cuban continues to inspire us with sequels to this book.

B000TEUSJK|4.0|This is a long movie. It does have actual real sex scenes. Great movie if you like the dark side of Rome and porn combined. The movie does have a great plot and is artfully exposing and semi-factual. Not for minors. If you have a strong stomach and enjoy twisted people having sex with anyone and everyone you will like this movie.
B005DOL0R0|1.0|There's not really anything wrong with it but you don't get much for the $30. The exterior seems fairly tough but the interior isn't going to give much padding. It should be priced in the 5 to $10 range.

B0034G4P94|5.0|Trust the excellent 5-star reviews you are reading here: 'Warrior' is one of the best movies of the year! It breaks my heart that it was largely ignored in theaters and has been omitted from a lot of critics' year-end top 10 lists. I add about 5 movies to my DVD collection each year. 'Warrior' is one of those 5 for 2011.<br /><br />Much to my surprise, this movie involving MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fighters is an emotionally riveting character study that retains elements of action and suspense. And the acting is first-rate! Tom Hardy (from Inception) plays Tommy Riordan who deeply internalizes anger and guilt that we catch a glimpse of each time he's in the ring. Joel Edgerton plays high-school Physics teacher Brendan Conlon, Tommy's brother, whose financial struggles send him to a place he had not planned on returning to. And finally, Nick Nolte gives a devastating performance as Tommy's and Brendan's father desperately seeking redemption from both of his sons. To say more would ruin it. But I hope that many will discover it on DVD and pass the word along. 'Warrior' is an outstanding film!
B005I64U66|5.0|Such a great movie!! Lots of laughs and Jennifer is ridiculously funny!! and sexy!! You will love it if you are into this kind of comedy. Very nice packaging and shipping was fast like always. Well done!
B006LYMILI|5.0|I REALLY disliked the original Planet of the Ape films; could not appreciate them at all.  Maybe it's because the makeup effects were so cheesy back then.<br /><br />BUT I loved this movie.  James Franco was perfect in the part of Rodman, working on a drug to cure Alzheimer's, which affects his father, played by John Lithgow - also great casting.<br /><br />The CGI effects are superb, from baby chimp Caesar to all the other apes in the movie.  They actually look and act real this time around - eyes, facial expressions, movements.  I was glad I bought this in blu-ray because of the special effects and scenery.<br /><br />The bad guys are bad, and the apes make you rally with them.  Of course, if you consider what happens in the other POTA movies, I guess you shouldn't rally to their cause too much.<br /><br />I liked the cameo of Charlton Heston showing in [[ASIN:B0006GANX2 The Agony and the Ecstasy]] on the TV in the ape cage room at the ape \\"sanctuary.\\"  Kind of ties all the Planet of the Apes movies together. Too bad Heston wasn't still alive to do a live cameo.  There was lots of other POTA trivia from other of the movies strewn through the movie - names especially such as \\"Bright Eyes\\" and \\"Cornelia.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie very much and would recommend to all except young children (mild profanity and violence).
B001LF2WCC|5.0|Classic Movie. Great action with fantastic actors. You will not be disappointed. By the way, the case is awesome. Its like a book with a hard cover, but totally cool!
1582432678|5.0|\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" is one of the most disturbing books I have ever read.  And it is one of the most brilliantly written.<br /><br />Shriver gives us a dark story of a tortured mother, grieving for the life she once had. Eva Khatchadourian is a very successful businesswoman, owns her own company and travels all over the world.  She is married to a man that she adores. And then she gets pregnant and gives birth to Kevin, a difficult child from the very beginning, a fact that her husband does not want to admit or address.<br /><br />We find out the background story on this extremely dysfunctional family through a series of letters written by Eva to her absent husband, Franklin.  And it is a heart-wrenching story at so many levels.  Marriage, childbearing, parenting, guilt, anguish, incomprehensible acts, unconditional love at a level I've never seen - all are explored with brutally honest but, oh so, lyrical prose.<br /><br />It hurt to read this book. I recommend it highly but don't expect to read it and then forget about it.  I don't think that's possible.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton stars in the film adaptation of this book.  I knew that before I read it and hers was the face I pictured for Eva.  If anyone can do justice to this role, I believe Swinton can and also director Lynne Ramsay, who also directed [[ASIN:B003S5TOYC Lovely Bones [Blu-ray]]].

B005CMSDKA|4.0|I thought I'd probably like \\"Hanna\\" - good concept (after all it's been used before) but I truly enjoyed this little movie.<br /><br />Intriguing, tough, unusual teenage heroine (Saoirse Ronan) raised in seclusion by her father (Eric Bana) and trained to kill.  Well-played dastardly villain (Cate Blanchett). Beautiful cinematography - I was glad I got the blu-ray version. Fun action sequences. European artsy feel to the whole film.<br /><br />The storyline is disjointed with some unnecessary subplots and there's sometimes an acid trip feel to some of the scenes but to me, it held together, was different and I enjoyed it.  There are so many male action heroes in movies today and it was nice, for once, to have a rockem sockem female lead.<br /><br />I was also glad to download the digital copy of the movie; I'll watch it again one day.  NOTE:  the digital copy has to be redeemed by 02/25/12.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|So glad I tried this game.  Angry Birds can frustrate me, but this one is relaxing, even when you fail.
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|I guess I was expecting a movie along the lines of [[ASIN:B002WY65VU Zombieland]] (which I thoroughly enjoyed too) but \\"Stake Land\\" is definitely not a light look at a vampire apocalypse and I sure wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Vampires are everywhere and the only thing worse than the creatures are the human scum buckets, taking advantage of a terrible crisis, raping and pillaging wherever they want, or the religious fanatics looking for someone to blame and punish.  Our little group of heroes just want to kill all the vampires they possibly can and try to make it safely to New Eden, the sanctuary they have heard of but aren't convinced isn't a myth.<br /><br />Casting is good (I especially liked Kelly McGillis as Sister, Nick Damici as Mister, and Connor Paolo as Martin). Also, special effects were well done, not over-done.<br /><br />Dark but not as despairing as [[ASIN:B001FB5634 The Road]], I recommend this to anyone that likes post-apocalyptic or vampire (not cute huggy types) or zombies (these creatures actually reminded me more of zombies than vampires) or horror movies.

B0034G4P94|5.0|Im a female college student home for the holidays and stopped by redbox to rent a movie last night to watch with my parents. This looked like the only semi-interesting one so I brought it home. I vaguely remembered seeing a glimpse of the trailer when it was in theaters but I don't remember talking to anyone who had seen it and I definitely hadn't so I had no preconceptions about it. As I was putting it in the DVD player, my mom & I were joking that thank goodness it only cost a dollar because there was no way we were going to like a movie about two guys beating each other up in a cage match. well, to sum up the movie, it was awesome. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The character development is so good and it is nothing like I thought it'd be. I don't want to give anything away but I highly recommend it!!
1419702238|5.0|Where do I start with this one? This book is incredibly hilarious and has a awesome story. Don't want to spoil anything but the book goes along with Greg being accused for something (he thinks) and he thinks that he could get arrested for it but that's not the funny part. There are things that have nothing to do with the story that will make you laugh the most. If you read the last book The Ugly Truth then you could see that the plot does not take a big roll in the overall book and a lot are stuff are random and out of the ordinary. But with this book they keep the random things within the plot to make a great story combination.
B006P8KKYW|5.0|Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross follow up last years Oscar and Golden globe winning score for the \\"The Social Network\\" with the score for David Fincher's version of Stieg Larsson's Novel \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\". Just like with \\"The Social Network\\" Fincher asked Reznor and Ross to provide the score for his latest Film and it proves a wise choice as Reznor and Ross have crafted nearly 3 hours of dark, melodic and haunting music. This score bares no resemblance to their previous work with Fincher. This is after all \\"The Feel Bad Movie of Christmas\\" and it's fair to say that Reznor and Ross have crafted a perfect feel for the Film that itself is bleak and cold(It features a lot of snow) in presentation.  Just listening to \\"She Reminds Me Of You\\" with it's cold atmospheric feel including the eerie sound of chimes as you can hear a the sound of a guitar droning in the distance, it sets up the rest of the score well. Trent Reznor's wife Mariqueen Maandig Reznor provides Vocal effects on a number of the tracks and is probably best used on \\"While Waiting\\" which is as much sinister sounding as it is soothing sounding. \\"The Seconds Drag\\" even includes a ticking clock used to good effect. A lot of the time the music creeps up on you such as in \\"People Lie All The Time\\" which seems to use a synthesizer sound left over from the eighties before adding a beautiful sounding piano. Even \\"Pinned and Mounted\\" starts off tame before changing to add some big sounding beats\\".  Anybody thinking that Reznor was not going to include some big industrial guitars played over heavy beats can rest assured as on tracks like \\"A Thousand Details\\", \\"Great Bird Of Prey\\" and \\"The Heretics\\" which features a screaming guitar midway through. Then there's \\"Oraculum\\" with it's 8 minute running time featuring big synthesized tribal beats. You can even add in the the 7 minute long \\"Infiltrator\\" which is an epic piece of music wich features all different types of noise, the kind of thing Reznor does best.  Of course anybody who saw the trailer from earlier this year knows that it includes a cover version of Led Zeppelin's \\"Immigrant Song\\" sung by Karen O from the Yeah Yeah Yeah's. They really do the song justice giving it a rocking synth feel full of blazing Guitars and beats. The choice of Karen O to sing the lead was David fincher's idea, she has confessed to not even knowing the song title but she delivers a powerful performance and is quite at home with this sound as anybody who heard the Yeah Yeah yeah's third album \\"It's Blitz\\" would testify. \\"Immigrant Song\\" starts off the album and another cover version closes it. How To Destroy Angels a band which features Mariqueen Maandig Reznor on vocals as well as Trent reznor and Atticus Ross, they cover Bryan Ferry's \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\" and take it from it's original sounding eighties style to a fresh up to date reworking.  \\"The Girl With The dragon tattoo\\" is a wonderfully crafted dark and atmospheric score, it's great for a dark room and a decent pair of headphones as the music sweeps over you. It's hard to really pick pieces of music out and at nearly 3 hours and 39 tracks long it is quite an undertaking to sit and listen to individual pieces but it is well worth it. It's definitely the best score I have heard this year, and after working with Reznor and Ross on his last 2 films it's hard to imagine Fincher getting anybody else to score his movies from here in, as Reznor and Ross have perfectly captured the feel of \\"The Girl With The Dragon tattoo.\\"

There is fallout for everyone, not just those at the firm, from firings to layoffs to general embarrassment, as well as problems that would affect others not even aware of the situation.  It would probably help to understand something about trading, market shares, and such.

B001F0WXY0|5.0|EDIT: I wanted to revisit my review as the publisher finally seems to have noticed the negative feedback on this book, and has fixed the severe editing issues in the original released version.  The price has also be lowered, making this a much more appealing purchase.  Ebook readers can now enjoy this classic scifi story, without having to deal with the previous problems.
1594744769|3.0|The many good reviews convinced me to read this book and I'm not sorry, but by the end of the book I was frustrated. Unlike some reviewers, I thought the first half of the book was wonderful.  Jacob's struggles to make sense of his Grandfather's life, the stories he had been told and how that related to his own life were deeply moving and well told.  The descriptions of the island and his first visit to the house were evocative and haunting.  Once he discovered the children, though, I thought the story began to break down.    I love a good fantasy but the author has to make me feel that it's true, which Riggs didn't accomplish for me. Even with the photographs, many of the children felt forced as though Riggs was trying to hard to make up a story about the photographs.  He boxed himself in with his own story too.  It was obvious from somewhere just past the middle of the book that there was not going to be a good ending.  Stories with bad endings have a place but in the later parts of the book, Riggs rushed through the adventures of the characters with not enough attention to the emotional side of the story.  He didn't give you a place to cry.  An ending that terrible should have made you cry.  I had bought this book as a gift, but have changed my mind.  I didn't dislike it enough to feel that I wasted my time.  In fact I enjoyed it many ways and will remember it, but it's not good enough for the implied recommendation of giving as a gift.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a very insiteful series done by HBO. I usually don't care for HBO stuff & there is language & brief nudity in one scene but I cant wait to watch it again. Seller was very prompt in sending it also. THX
B003NWS5AO|5.0|This is an excellent CD, well worth buying. Robert Plant takes folk music and rocks out on it.  He is not trying to extend his Led Zeppelin \\"glory days\\", and he is not retreating into some kind of \\"washed up\\" mode. He is taking his music to a new level. I recommend this CD.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I just finished reading this amazing book and I'm so in LOVE with the deeply tortured beautifully written main character. I literally found myself obsessing over it throughout the day ticking off the hours until I could dive back into its pages. WOW! I will follow Ms. James through anything she writes in the future in the hopes that her writing will continue to move me as profoundly as this this book has. I finished it and dove straight into the second book and it's just as moving as the first one. Thank goodness I won't have to wait too long for the third and last book to this trilogy as it's due to come out at the end of January.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|I had read some negative reviews and some good reviews before reading these short stories but I thought the stories were excellent. This is not a novel , each short story is short and able to stand alone .  I have read most of the author's other books and this was different but still great. I was not disappointed at all! Of course it didn't take long to read but it gets 5 stars from me.

0440244412|5.0|Might be SPOILERS ahead, so read at your own peril!  Now that I've said that, I can honestly say that I really have a love hate relationship with this book.  KMM really knows how to lead her readers on an emotional roller coaster ride. I almost stopped reading this one-third way through because I was so mad and frustrated at everyone and everything! But thank god I didn't.  I absolutely love this book! It is now one of my favorite books ever, but my road there is a long and arduous one, much like Mac's journey till the end.  First of all, I wanted to throw this book away because I hate Mac and the repetition of everything. For a few pages I thought everything was solved. Everyone would be happy. I mean, there's still the Sinsar Dubh flying around killing people, but everything else is all right, but no! Few pages later, it's back to square one. Mac seems to have forgotten everything she's felt ever since the end of the last book. So much for too little, too late. You'd think she'd learn when she'd decided to destroy the world for someone, but no, it's back to the same old, same old.  Why does she not learn? What does she gain from not being honest? She realizes that the fact she grieved so much was because Barrons was never honest with her, so why can't she just be different and stop playing games, but does she do that? No! She just has to be petty and immature and so they're stuck at the same place they were since the beginning. I hated their relationship and all their little mysteries and lies and omissions. So many sufferings could have been averted if everyone had been honest, but of course not, we're human beings.   But other than that, this book is full of twists and turns that every time I turn a page I expect something to slap me in the face before I've even absorbed the last surprise. Good thing is, every question's been answered by the end: Alina's murderer, Mac's identity, Barrons, V'lane, the Queen's location, Christian's location.   Beyond that, this book is so satisfying because it has two of the most beautiful love story ever. I've read a lot of romances, but very few if any have touched me the way the love between the Unseelie King and his concubine have touched me. The feeling of longing and sorrow whenever Mac is visiting the White Mansion is simply heartbreaking. The fact that after hundreds of thousands of years the UK still feel the same way about that one woman, would have given the world for her, would create and destroy worlds for her is beyond imagining.   Then there is Mac and Barrons. While it is a fantasy series, no one can deny that all of us were wishing that Mac and Barrons end up together, and they do. Theirs might not yet be the epic love of the UK and his concubine, but I'm sure in a few thousand years people will tell the love between Mac and Barrons. Mac has finally figured out her heart (thank goodness) and accepted what it meant when she would destroy the world for Barrons when she did not nearly feel the same when Alina died. There's a simple acceptance and trust between them that while it took forever to happen, when it does happen nothing can topple their love. They belong with each other, as simple as that.   After reading this, I'm not sure I can find another romance that can stand up to this.   I'm not saying this series is in any way perfect, as seen by my endless ranting, but it is a definite read. I'm not saying I would read this series all over again, or even this book (uh...maybe the second half of this book), but I am saying that I'm sad it's over, that I already know everything that's happened. I wish I could go back and rediscover everything that's happened in this book to re-experience the joy and satisfaction I felt as the events unfold. Rereading it would never be as satisfying as reading it the first time.   Rating: 4.5/5

B0063IH60K|5.0|Very addictive and entertaining.  The adds aren't too bothersome and only appear at the start of each game. I have this now on my iPhone and Kindle Fire.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes solitaire but doesn't want to clean up and shuffle cards.
B00158K0S8|5.0|When this film was released I was still serving in the U.S. Navy. At that time I was very much against the Vietnam War as many of my generation were. I didn't see this marvellous film in the theater.<br /><br />Years later I saw the film on VHS and was amazed at what I missed. Now that I have the Blu-ray release I have to say it is more stunning than ever. In fact, it may be too good on Blu-ray because the make-up on George C. Scott's eyebrows is quite visible in the famous opening speech. You can actually see the fabric on which the eyebrows are mounted!<br /><br />The audio is better than ever in Blu-ray. I especially like the music. The sounds of battle are very realistic and very loud.<br /><br />I would advise anyone interested in this film to buy the Blu-ray version. It comes with the regular DVD in the same box. On a larger screen HDTV this is simply an astounding viewing experience.<br /><br />The screenplay is also extremely well crafted. It tells an amazing story.<br /><br />George C. Scott cannot be praised enough for his work in Patton.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Solid album with killer riffs, fantastic drum beats, clear bass, and Belladonna did a great job with the vocals.  I was felling down with the lame album that Megadeth just released, but now Anthrax just made me believe there's still hope for real metal!!  I can't stop listening the CD, even at work it sounds in my head!! My favorite song: JUDAS PRIEST!!  Now that many people just buy few songs on iTunes, this album is worth to buy the whole package.  Enjoy and buy yourself as a holiday gift.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|I am so very happy. I grew up with Dr. Mike, Sully, and the gang and fell in love. The other day I was searching Amazon for something else and just so happened to stumble across this series to find that it was the complete series and at such a great price. I was quite elated! I received my shipment within two days and am very pleased with the way the dvds are packaged. Each season has their own individual box set and all six seasons are put together nicely in a decorative box. The Dr. Quinn movies are included! What a buy thank you Amazon!

B0067JMJ8E|3.0|As a diehard Yes, and Jon Anderson, fan, I held off for a while before ordering \\"Fly From Here\\", unimpressed by the sound clips I had heard on Amazon and elsewhere. After a few listens, I concluded that \\"Fly From Here\\" was nothing more or less than a pleasant album, featuring a number of pedestrian tracks that in no way capture the \\"other-worldly\\" nature of most Yes songs. It was so clear that the missing ingredient was, and remains, Jon Anderson.<br /><br />Now, on to \\"In The Present-Live From Lyon\\". Obviously, it would be unfair to pick apart a band that was so early in their period of \\"reinvention\\". Benoit David was surely just starting to become comfortable in his new \\"shoes\\", and the keyboards \\"situation\\" was still a bit sticky. Thus, this newly released live album was certain to have shortcomings, and indeed it does, though nowhere as many as some other reviewers have indicated. Yes, the pacing of some of the tracks is a bit slow, but that stands comfortably in contrast to the machine-gun pacing on \\"Yessongs\\", wherein the band seemed to be playing as quickly as they could, especially Steve Howe. (The relatively new \\"Union-Live\\" CD/DVD 1991 set features the band, all members included, playing at a pace closer to \\"Live From Lyon\\", so the overall pacing is not an issue for me.) In any case, having listened to the entire \\"...Lyon\\" album a few times, I can comfortably state that the band does not sound tired, nor does Benoit David need to be negatively compared to Jon Anderson. The band sounds relatively fine overall, and Mr. David does a creditable job of \\"almost\\" capturing the \\"Yes\\" spirit on all fourteen tracks. (No, he's not Anderson; and no, it is unlikely that he will contribute as a songwriter at anywhere near the same level as Anderson. Jon is a rare talent indeed, and Yes and its fans were the recipients of his vision for four decades.) It was definitely a treat to hear live versions of \\"Machine Messiah\\" and \\"Tempus Fugit\\", and interesting to hear the updated takes on so many Yes standards.<br /><br />When the \\"new\\" live album was offered as an Amazon mp3 download for $4.99, I finally took the plunge, and have been enjoying it since. (For Jon Anderson fans, pick up \\"The Living Tree\\" and \\"Survival And Other Stories\\"; both great albums which will remind you of how amazing Anderson truly is.) If as nothing more than a \\"period-piece\\", \\"...Lyon\\" is a bit of Yes history worth owning.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I like puzzles and things that challenge my mind - the kind of games and activities that make me think but not to the point of feeling inferior from my inability to work through them - the kind that leave me thinking \\"WTH?!?  I've a degree in computer science for cryin' out loud!  I should be able to figure this out!!\\".  That's why I love this app.  The puzzles are challenging, well conceived, and just plain fun!
B001DIDUHS|5.0|This is a great album. The music and composition is awsome. I definitely recommend this album. This is a must for a Black Sabbath fan.

B005DD7H50|4.0|Limitless is original and different yet it does not make sense,I am not a fan of things that do not make sense.However,Good acting some DeNiro added in here and there and a little item that makes it all Perfect or so it seems.The Camera work is great but at times annoying and would make some nauseous but the story is different from what is been churned out now and while it does not make sense(It is a movie though)It is worth watching.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy \\"zen-like\\" games, mostly because I hate the stress of time pressure. I like game play to be relaxing rather than the opposite. So, this was a welcome discovery. \\"Zen-like\\" is apt, in that you might learn something about yourself. I am intrigued that in some puzzles, I can immediately see the minimum-moves solution (even some lengthy ones), while in others I can repeat the puzzle many times and still not \\"get it.\\" It's a great option for those long waits at the doctors office, where there is too much distraction to read a book. Both thumbs up.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|I haven't used this yet but it will come in handy in tight spots.  I have seen these in stores at a much higher price.  My only worry is the integrity of the contacts during use. Time will tell.
B002GYI9C4|3.0|Good world-building, characters well defined, dialog okay, realistic.  An editor would have noticed that he used the phrase &#34;rolled his eyes&#34; 32 times and would have recommended that the author find another way for characters to express skepticism or disbelief.  Ending was irritating:  &#34;...the warmth of being held....all she had ever really wanted.&#34;  She has all these powers but she really just wants a man?  Give me a break!
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas gifts -- I've given the DVD several times in the past few years.  This year's recipient was thrilled (it's one of her favorites).
B004K4AVAG|5.0|(I have not listened to the Special Edition album with the bonus songs, and the version I have is unfortunately censored. But, I know that isn't Lady Gaga's doing, so I'm not even going to dignify it with a complaint.)  BOOM.  That's sort of what happened in my brain when I realized that Lady Gaga had a massive amount of talent. I refused to see or believe it for the first two years of her career, but this year it hit me. Now, I'm not a fan of pop music, in general. I actually spent several hours last night listening to some of the top female pop stars, trying to come up with a soundtrack for the play I am directing...and somewhere around Ke$ha I decided that shooting myself would be a better way to end the night. I'm sorry, I don't mean to hate on Ke$ha, but that stuff just isn't for me.  I have been a closet Madonna fan for many years. She's a smart woman who knows how to work the business, and she sings live, despite all the dancing. She has grown so much over the years, and reinvents herself quicker and more frequently than anyone else.  But THEN... Then... There is Lady Gaga. At first I thought she was sort of like Madonna on crack, reinventing herself every day. But no, she doesn't \\"reinvent\\" herself. That would imply that she tries to be more appealing and kitschy. If anything, Lady Gaga started out kitschy, doing a style of music and lyrics that would gain pop music listeners. Once she was in the door, she was freer to let her freak flag fly, and I think she started to become more Herself. That's what happened on The Fame Monster. We started to see the real Lady Gaga.  I have been listening to Born This Way for the last several days, and it is so surprisingly different from everything she's done previously. She still speaks her mind and says things people will probably take issue with (just listen to Government Hooker, Judas or Heavy Metal Lover). But...it is an excellent album. No one song is outstanding, that is to say literally Stands Out from the rest, but I don't think that's a bad thing. That means that no song is a real dud. They've all got something interesting and likeable. She has a very good ear for catchy chord progressions, and I just discovered why her songs don't sound like normal pop to me: they're almost always in a minor key. Crazy! This album, especially, feels like techno/electronica married to metal, rock, country, and pop. Depending on the song. No other music sounds like this, though people have said that all of the songs \\"sound alike\\". I do and don't understand that. When a song starts, I know which one it is. And yet, the entire album has a very heavy, very strong beat. It's employed on almost every song, which gives the album a darker, more industrial sound. And because she does have such a fine ear for music, it's like she has an inner compass for what people want to hear, what makes a \\"hit\\" single.   I think the reason none of the songs have done exceptionally well on the charts is because in making all of them really good, none of them are truly spectacular. At least, not at first, or even second listen. I would argue that all of the songs have something spectacular about them. People have accused her of selling out and trying too hard...and I think the former is completely false and that the latter is only sort of true. You can tell she put a lot into this album. It isn't a flawless album, but compared to where she is coming from, and the fact that this is basically her sophomore album...it's great. She shows maturity in so many ways, and it is simply a joy. I go back and forth on which song is my pick-of-the-day. Yesterday it was Americano. What will it be today?  With Born This Way, Lady Gaga has shown us that she is not just trying to get attention. She already has it. Now, she wants to show us who she really is. She has grown a lot, and this new album is obviously deeply personal. I don't remember the last time a pop star has bared so much soul within an entire album. Every song has some meaning to her, and it's a little hard to tell with all the poppiness, but you hear her sing live and you'll understand what I mean. Listen to her in interviews talk about this album. It is pure Gaga, and for the first time we are truly seeing HER.  Lady Gaga loves her fans, and she loves pushing boundaries. She is theatricality incarnate.  I think Lady Gaga fans don't like this album for the same reason Metallica fans don't like what happened in the '90s. \\"This isn't the music I fell in love with!\\" ...No, duh. If these artists kept churning out the same $%^&, they wouldn't be Artists. They would stagnate, burn out, and/or fade away. They might make a come-back, or they might just fade from memory. In THREE YEARS, Lady Gaga has insured a place in people's memories for at least the next decade. It doesn't really matter what happens to her after this album, what direction she goes in...there's no going back.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Personally I liked this album better than their previous release. I fell like it is a great album listened to start to finish continuously as well.
B004G6009K|5.0|My daughter loves it because of the long hair, my husband and son laugh at the funny horse in it, and I like the musical facet.  A great remake of a great story, not too hard to explain to a 4 year old- not a bunch of people getting killed all over the place.  Excellent movie.  We like to get the DVD for the car, the digital for the tablet, and the Blu ray for the big screen.  Totally worth the few extra bucks.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me. \\"~ Immanuel Kant<br /><br />Anything which comes from Terence Malick is beautiful, sublime and profound. If any modern director's name can be mentioned in the same line as Andrei Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, and Stanley Kubrick - it has to be Malick. I've always admired and deeply respected him and made sure to see all his films which is not that difficult given that he has made only five having appeared to the movie lovers  once in five, ten,  or even in 20 years to present us with yet another masterpiece. Yes, that's true. Terrence Malick has only made five movies since 1973, the year of his stunning debut Badlands but his every film is a treasure. His last film The Tree of Life is his claim to cinematographic immortality. Has he succeeded? The opinions split completely starting with the film's premiere at the Cannes Film Festival (2011). The film was met with both boos and applauds. Then, it received the major Cannes award - the coveted Golden Palm - and once again it was booed and greeted at the time of announcement. These who love the film are struck with its scope, boldness and beauty but these who don't, scornfully dismiss it as the example of self-indulgent ponderous pseudo-art film. Looks like We all watch a different movie even if we sit at the same theater in front of the same screen where the great artist bares his soul and takes us to the incredible journey of self-discovery, finding the place for humanity, universe, and the Supreme Being on the map of existence. There are very few movies ever made that could compare with the latest creation by Terrence Malick, philosopher, humanist, visionary. What I saw was a masterpiece, equal in scope of its vision to (an inevitable comparison, I know, but appropriate) Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey: 2001. But while Odyssey stays always remote and cosmically dark and indifferent, Malick's film is filled with humanity and is as interested in the Universe evolution as it is in the short on the global scale and ordinary lives of one ordinary family in Waco, Texas, in the 1950-60s. That makes Tree of Live reminiscent of the other great film of past, Zerkalo (The Mirror)  by  Russian director, Andrei Tarkovsky.<br /><br />The road to Tree of Life took over 30 years.  While working on Days of Heaven, Malick conceived the idea of the film that would explore the origins of life, and wrote the screenplay, Q (Quisida) but the attempt failed, and it was one of the reasons why Malik left the cinema for 20 years. Finally, the time has come for a long-awaited and very personal writer/director's creation. There are not many filmmakers who create the movies searching for answers to the eternal questions, \\"Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?\\"<br /><br />There are perhaps just a handful of masters, who like Malik, are capable of capturing their thoughts in truly unforgettable meaningful images.  At the beginning of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" there is a wonderful phrase that seems perfectly relate to Malick's films:  \\" The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point..\\" Such is the world in Malick's Tree of Life - many things there simply do not have the names yet.<br /><br />Malick's Vision is deep and poetic. It is compared with Tarkovsky's and Kubrick's; comparison which is more than deserved. The first two films coming to memory while watching Tree of Life, are Space Odyssey: 2001 and The Mirror. I found Tree of Life even more effective  than the Kubrick's film of because, being on the same monumental scale of the themes covered and of the same highest artistic merits, the  Malick's film is  endlessly and painfully human, which makes it much closer to me than eternal indifferent dark silenceof the magnificent cosmological epic of Kubrick's cinema space.<br /><br />I've rarely been touched so profoundly with what was happening on the screen when I not just saw but, rather, lived through  new,  much more ambitious and grandiose (in all senses of the word) than anything he ever attempted and achieved, Malick's creation. I fully understand that this film may and will leave many viewers perplexed, frustrated, and cause a desire dismiss it or to mock it.  These voices addressing  God, and God answered Job,  the seemingly absent plot, action, and dialogue  - all of these  may cause a negative perception  as well as  film's constant moving to and from  different times and  dimensions. And yes, there is  a scene with the dinosaurs, whose appearance caused some shock on the part of viewers. I think that in the scheme of the universe, created by Malik, dinosaurs are just as important as all the other components, including us,  the living.<br /><br />Malick, known introvert and recluse,  is remarkably candid and open in the Tree of Life,  his most personal film. He reflects on the eternal and ancient as the universe itself matters and does not know the answers to them,  but he has the talent to embody the thoughts and reflections in the visions of superhuman beauty and deep love. He peers into the life of just one family whom he settled in the provincial town of his own childhood in Texas circa 1950s. But the story of this family in which the joy of innocence and discovery of the world,  dark whirlpools of growing up,  never-ending  struggle of  maternal and paternal origin in a child's soul,  conflicts, losses, regrets, finding  one's  way and awareness of the  place in the world, and, finally, an understanding f and forgiveness,  repeat closely  the stories  of millions  families at any place on earth. Maybe that's why  the story in the film became so  personal  to me.<br /><br />The beauty of the film is pure and sad. I think the viewers should immerse themselves in it, as in ocean water and allow it to wash over  them. Do not think, do not analyze, do not look for meaning in striking scenes of Cosmogony, but let them go through your soul.  I had to stop the movie several times, because watching  The Tree of Life is an overwhelming breathtaking sensual experience . It is filled with light, air, and open to all winds (notice the white light rippling curtain on the window in the  O'Brien house,  to which again and again returns  Emanuel  Lubezki `s camera). It is washed by with water - the source of life, a symbol of purification and dangerous, deceptive element . This film, like the titular tree, is firmly rooted in  Earth,  but directs  the branches and foliage to the sky, as if floating in the air. Maybe that's why the  levitation of redheaded Botticelli's Grace, re- incarnated in the beautiful Jessica Chastain feels so natural.<br /><br />Why did Lachrymose by Zbigniew Preisner accompany the birth of universe scenes? Why mourn, not Ode to Joy?  Does this mean that the death is already included in birth, and everything will come to an inevitable end - all living things and Time and Space?  Creating by the power of his talent, strikingly beautiful birth of the World scenes, finding for them the shades and nuances of colors that I have met only in one place on Earth - in Death Valley, Malick sees them as scenes of grief but expresses sorrow and wisdom in such perfect confluence of cinematic images and sounds that once entered into your soul, they will remain forever.<br /><br />I am sure that The Tree of Life is a film for multiple re-watches.  At different stages of a viewer's life, it might reveal parts of its mystery  but never to l the end. It is hard to recommend, but not to recommend it - simply impossible.  Is it perfect?

0307959856|2.0|I wanted to like Death Comes to Pemberley, I really did. It should have had an Austen flair, a mystery murder, and characters I couldn't help but love. Instead, I received an Austen set locale and little else. This book could very easily be reduced to the first and last `Books' of the novel without missing anything in the middle.<br /><br />The stage setting of the murder was adequate. While it may not live up to some of the greater murder mystery schemas, I was willing to hop on board for the ride. Sadly, much like Captain Denny, after the onset, I wanted to get off mid-trip. The trail of clues that would typically be present to guide a reader to the proper solution (or at the very least a well-founded guess) were absent. The entire middle portion of the story seemed to be stuck at a stand still. The reader gains no foresight into who the murderer is, how the murder takes place, or why one should even care. Was this not a manipulation of beloved Austen characters, I would not have had the motivation to continue reading until the end.<br /><br />Speaking of the ending, if you begin the journey and want to have any resolution as to how it concludes, you are forced to read through to the very last page. There is no possible way, no matter how skilled one might be at detective work, could the ending be deduced. The evidence is never explored, clues are never left, etc. etc. Sadly, this is one murder that probably would have been lost to a cold case, shut away never to be opened again; and perhaps, that would have been best.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|With all the hype that surrounds Remixed/Remastered records, and the resulting disappointment that follows, many fans are reluctant to spend money for music they already own. Let me state for the record, in the case of Aqualung, Steve Wilson has done a fantastic job sonically improving the sound, while preserving the integrity of the original mix. The clarity makes you feel like you are a fly on the wall during the actual recording of this classic album. Martin Barre's searing guitar riffs send chills down the spine, while the subtlety of the acoustic instruments and punch of the drumkit add depth and atmosphere. I highley recommend this 40th Edition.
0062101897|5.0|My daughter (15) is a huge Harry Potter fan and has read every book at least 2-3 times and watched every movie even more than that. This was at the top of her Christmas list this year and she got it from her grandfather.  She LOVES it.  She has pored over every page and loves to share things she's learned about how they made each movie, things that happened behind the scenes, funny anecdotes, etc.  It's a huge book with so much detail and so many great photos as well!  Definitely a book to cherish forever.  This is a perfect gift for the Harry Potter fan in your family!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a great little flash for Nikon. Has a small footprint. I primarily use this for bouncing and works great indoors. May be a little weak for very high ceilings. But you can be a little creative to overcome such situations. Works on two AA batteries and lasts for at least a 100 shots. I tend to recharge the batteries after that.   It doesnt have the power or the functionalities of its bigger siblings but thats the price for a smaller footprint. Build quality is good. I would recommend this flash.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a fun puzzle game that I play to kill time. The graphics are great and the music is relaxing. Doesn't get too difficult or too boring after time, but still challenging.

B005G4TJI4|5.0|Another great Transformer movie.  If you liked the first two Transformer movies, you'll like this one as well.  Several events from actual world history are worked into the story line early on, which makes the movie a little more interesting. Also, there is a twist about halfway through that you won't see coming, but it too makes the movie more interesting.
B002VECLVO|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I felt it was an instant classic. The cinematography is amazing. And every little detail in the movie fits the era so perfectly: the glasses worn by actors in the movie, the cigarettes in the dinner scene, the hairdos and even the aspirin tin. Not to mention that it being a Tom Ford movie (his directorial debut might I add), everyone and everything was just beautiful. I introduced a friend of mine to the movie and she fell in love with it. I felt it was the perfect gift for her since she doesn't own many movies. I have no doubt she'll enjoy it! I would suggest buying it in Blu-ray because it really DOES make a difference if you have a good tv. The person I bought this for is old school though, so I had to go with a regular dvd.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|X-Men: First Class is one of the best X-Men movies yet.  Even if you have no knowledge of the other X-Men movies, you will find this movie enjoyable.  There is a great storyline, great acting, great action scenes, and great special effects.  If you have seen the other X-Men movies, this movie's storyline lines up things for the other X-Men movies.  And even though there are scene where background info. must be provided so that the entire X-Men story line is fairly consistent through all X-Men movies, the pace of this movie never gets too slow nor too quick when providing tidbits of background.  All in all, if you just half-way like the other X-Men movies you'll definitely like X-Men: First Class.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|the most convenient thing I've ever used. definitely a great app. I use it for pretty much everything to stay organized.
0143034901|5.0|I am a hard to please reader. I want a novel with character development, clever use of literary devices; it should be lyrical at times, employing the perfect word at the perfect time, with extended metaphors, sprinklings of similes that aid the ever unfolding details. The Shadow of the Wind does all of this while delivering a mystical, historic, erotic tale.

B005HMHPGI|5.0|one of my all time favorite movies is on blu ray.  just perfect box set for this film. box had felt like feel to it, nice feature of bell and tree with george holding the kids.  when you open it up you get the bell from movie, and nice little booklet about movie inside.  you get both color and black and white of this film.  when i watched movie, i mean it is in perfect clarity and sound, just amazing, so if you feel like bringing back some good memories and fun times, pick this up and you will never regret it, plus looks great in box with bell, thank you
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Many others have already discussed the film, and like most of them, I really enjoy this picture.  Ledger's performance as the Joker is completely absorbing.  If anything, the Joker is \\"too\\" good in that Batman comes off as relatively dull and reactionary in comparison.  Anyway, I do have one little complaint about this DVD: there's no two-channel mix, for us luddites that still don't have 5.1 gear.  My DVD player and/or old stereo gear didn't seem to handle the 5.1 soundtrack very well.  At times dialogue sounded a bit strange, although still audible.  And I think my player's downmixing of 5.1 also affects the musical score.  Anyway, if DVD producers are listening, please include 2-channel mixes for those of us without optimal home theater gear.  That was pretty much a standard thing on DVDs for a number of years.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It's just an amazing, feel good Christmas movie. I think Kate Winslet is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses out today.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|We love this movie, and rented it several times before buying the Blu-ray copy. The Blu-ray is definitely an upgrade. Even after seeing the movie a number of times, I always enjoy seeing the new things that you notice with a high-definition picture.
1594744769|3.0|I didn't love this book, but to be fair, I'm not in the target audience.  Unless you are a middle-aged person who is intrigued by the chilling memento moro style photos, please don't read any further.  Still here?  Don't be fooled into thinking this book is creepy and macabre.  It isn't.  The girl on the cover is not a phantom, she just floats if she's not weighted down.  The photos are nice, but probably the least chilling explanation is provided for each one.  Imagine seeing a picture of a creepy looking man wearing a shirt riddled with red, jagged holes and holding his thumbs up for the camera.  Now imagine that the caption read \\"Stanley likes to dress in rags before engaging in tomato fights with his friends.\\"  That's not an example from the book, but it could be.    The plot centers around a sixteen year old boy who wants to give up his life of privledge to hang out with a bunch of little kids in a time warp that's a cross between \\"Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters\\" and \\"Never-Never Land\\".  Personally I can't imagine a worse fate than being a sixteen year old trapped in a daycare facility for all eternity, but that's just me.  His biggest draw: a hot girl who is still pining for his grandpa.  There are plenty of other girls in the world.  Do you really want to be trapped with one that might call a family member's name during a very special moment for you?

Amazon-please don't place 2-d movies selections in with the 3-d ones!  I had to pay $2.98 to return an item that shouldn't have been offered in a search of 3-d movie selections.  Ouch.  All in all I love Amazon, but I'll be more careful in the future.  My bad.

If sales are good on the movie, they are going to make the other two books into a movie also.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Original, sweet-tempered and enjoyable film which is one of my favorites among Burton's oeuvre. Ignored in life, mocked in death, Edward D. Wood Jr. was a real phenomenon in American cinema history, especially famous for his Z-budget filmmaking. Making a biopic about such a schlocky visionary reputed as the worst director of all-time is just a groovy idea, which only Tim Burton or Coen Brothers dare to do it.<br /><br />Shot beautifully in moody black & white, the film centers on Wood's most \\"prolific\\" period, when he relentlessly churned out one movie after the next, from his 1953 beyond-awful debut \\"Glen or Glenda\\" to his \\"groundbreaking\\" 1959 sci/fi \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\". Paying a final tribute to this idiosyncratic director, Burton opts to portray Wood and his misfit menagerie in an overexaggeratedly sympathetic way, not to depict the darker side of his life. The film ends before his slide into porn, misery and alcoholism. The film charts Wood's tragi-comic career: his flagrant ineptitude as a writer, producer and director; his efforts to beat the bushes for cash; his indifferent, hyper-enthusiastic and over-optimistic disposition against all kinds of professional and personal setbacks; his sheer passion and child-like naivet&eacute;; his transvestite tendencies with a particular taste in fluffy Angora sweaters, blond wigs and high heels; and lastly his strange friendship with 70-year old sepulchral Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi.<br /><br />The film is hilarious and witty from beginning to end, especially the recreation of certain scenes from Wood's original work (e.g. Lugosi's fight with a flaccid rubber octopus puppet and graveyard scene of \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\") are hysterically funny. But such a film desperately needs a some degree of gravity. The relationship and chemistry between Wood and Lugosi is the emotional core of the film. Johnny Depp gives a sympathetic and charismatic portrayal of Wood. But, this is Martin Landau who really steals the show, and he is the glue that holds the movie together. His performance is dazzling, conveying the ego, pathos, pride and real dignity of the former horror hero Bela Lugosi. This is the role which won him Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and he really deserved it.<br /><br />To me, \\"Ed Wood\\" shows that life is not merely about success, fame or money; but rather about your creative spirit, and how much you cling to your principles and how much you love what you do. Burton portrays Wood as a winner, because he dared to make films yet he had absolutely no gift when it comes to filmmaking. Today, despite the fact that his films are used as a benchmark that the most awful films are measured by, that's not the problem at all.<br /><br />The wonderful irony of the film is that it won two Oscars with the name \\"Ed Wood\\" written on it :))holds the movie together.

It also can do it in a parabola-type graph so you can see which wifi source is the strongest if there's more than one. I like having it, so I'm going to keep it.

B0036EH3XE|1.0|This show was amazing as a whole.  The 6th season was a waste of time.  I go back and forth as to whether I would have rather stopped on Season 5 rather than see the writers lame attempt at closure.  I agree with the majority of people that it appears the writers did not have adequate time to tie up the tons of questions so they answered as many as they could by magic, religion, and making the viewer guess.  If I didn't watch this season I would be just as well off as if I knew I would have to draw my own conclusions there would be no point in watching this whole season that was just weird (not the good Lost weird either).  At the end I felt for the writers who were clearly grasping at straws as if they had told a lie and gotten too deep to dig themselves out.  If you have watched the other 5 seasons you are pot committed and pretty much have to watch so they really didn't need to put out something good.  It is like when someone puts in their 2 weeks notice at work.  Do you really think they are gonna work as hard when they know they are gone after this season?  The answer in this case was a resounding NO.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Sony hasn't changed the design of its controllers for years. The last change to a controller was when they added the dual analog sticks to the ps1. Since then little has changed for playstation controllers. This one has rumble built in and slight motion controls. Wireless is nice so I can sit back and relax.
0440244412|5.0|Just want to say this is the best series ever for me. I was glued to every page. So glad I didn't read this series until the last one was published.....I hate to wait for the next book in a series, especially if the author takes 2-4 years between books (anyone know who I'm talking about?).  Karen Moning is a genius....where does she get her mastery of detail? It seemed like just when I thought I had the whole thing figured out, something on the next page would just blow my mind and have me gasping out loud.  I love these books so much, I'm going to start them over again and read slower so I can savor every morsel of mystery.  Thank you, Karen for giving us this treasure.

0439023521|5.0|This is a wonderfull book I could not put it down. The funny thing is my 11year old told me that her teacher was reading this book.My daughter was making the story sound so wonderfull and it just made me want to read it.  So I did, took me 2 days and I read the 2nd one also and the third I was told not to buy becouse it was a christmas gift..Im waiting but its so hard..  I need to know what is going to happen to these kids.People.I need to know that everything will be fine..Hurry Christmas the third book, I need it now!!  These books are a read now I hope the author will write more not on the same subject to make the story drag on and ruin it, but another trilogy that will also be just as good..
0553801473|3.0|A lot of people are comparing this to Jordan starting to slow down and go off the rails with \\"The Wheel of Time.\\" They are greatly mistaken. I have read Jordan. I failed to even make it to book three. This is MUCH better than Jordan. I think what people are most disappointed in is that it seems still that MORE should have happened, given the total of ten years that we've been waiting on \\"book four.\\" Perhaps they were misled by the title, thinking we'd get Dany's invasion in this book, but Martin has been saying for a while now that this \\"wasn't necessarily the case,\\" so I took that to mean \\"no.\\"<br /><br />Martin's prose is redundant at times. Theon is particularly prone to grating repetitions of thought patterns - \\"Reek reek it rhymes with ___\\" and constant ruminations on how Jeyne is not the real Arya to the point where I'm screaming \\"WE GET IT, GEORGE.\\" There are three or four too many damn POV characters; Asha and Quentyn and Victarion all add absolutely nothing to the story that couldn't be better told through other eyes or left out entirely.<br /><br />And yet I can forgive him because I still respect the incredible scale he's aiming for and the strength of his dialog and descriptions, even the unnecessary ones. I'll only start to lose faith if he suddenly announces that there'll be eight books instead of seven...and then nine...and then ten...you know, like Jordan. Until then, if he's set on seven books, I'll believe him, and I think it can still be done. Those who say he's lost interest are exaggerating. Even when this is slow going, it's never truly boring (with the exception of certain characters in 'Feast'), and despite what some reviewers say, there IS forward momentum here. These characters are still fascinating to read about and their world is richly drawn and compelling.
1451627289|5.0|I spent longer on this book than any other I remember. It has almost 1,000 pages and is so good  I didn't want to rush through.  I believe it's my favorite of Stephen King's works.  Time travel surely isn't a simple thing about which to write, but he does it in such a believable way.  A young man travels back in time to try to prevent the assassination of JFK.   As he prepares for that event, he makes several trips back to practice and changes other bad things along the way. The problem is each time he returns, everything has been reset. In order to change a second event, he must do the first change all over again. On the third trip, he has to repeat what happened during the first and second.  I don't want to spoil and tell how his changes affect the future, but I suggest you don't miss this terrific story
B005KELQEU|4.0|I have a bigger Belkin for my 2nd gen. Kindle and this one for my new Touch. Both sleeves are the right size and functional, but the latter's logo is upside down, which bothers me.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Everything was great!
1451627289|4.0|I just finished \\"11/22/63,\\" and loved it. Yes, I caught the political bend, and I don't bend that way, but...hey, it doesn't bother me when others express their side. That's how I came to my beliefs, hearing those of others.   Back to the book - from the moment I saw in on the shelf, I knew I would devour it. King's books do that; the reader is pulled deeply into the story, the characters are fully developed and alive, the plot moves at an asynchronous pace - pulling, tugging, grabbing, releasing, pulling, etc. And since I remember the assassination, and have studied it some, this book wrapped itself around my head right there in the book store!   It is interesting to note that just a few years ago, before science discovered the real possibility of alternate universes and string theory, this book could not have been written. It's another of my fascinations: the blending of fiction and reality, although proposed theoretical reality in this case. How cool it was to follow Jake down those few steps into the blinding light of day and the reality of 1958, and be introduced to all of the mysteries therein.    I kept thinking Amberson could have traversed into that era a few years later, say 1960 - 62, rather than 1958. For me, it drug a little during his early months in Jodie, TX., and I kept thinking King needed to develop story there to fill in the year, or two, before the actual day of the assassination. The relationship he built was necessary, but I wasn't intrigued with all the details of his career there. But that's just me.   In the end, King brought it altogether, tied up all the loose ends, and though it didn't end like I thought it would when I was on page 550, it ended in the only manner in which it could. I'm still feeling the glow of that ending, about half an hour ago. Makes me want to re-read the book, but I think I need to wait a while before picking it up again. I have some other people in mind who I think will enjoy it first.    *****  Now, if you don'tmind, please excuse the plug:   If you like time-travel, you might like the time-warp in \\"Sofie, the Queen of Oakland,\\" available right here in Amazon. It is a story of how a young, and sexually abused, beauty queen (1927, Oakland), finds some comfort by communicating with a present day prisoner. The only explanation occurs through a burp in the universe which opens the time-warp for her. Oh, and yeah, I'm the author.
B005TBN04S|1.0|Whereas the first film, even though it wasn't great, had pace and originality and humor and decent writing...this seemed forced and labored and tragic and like an aggregate script written by several people in isolation from each other. And the story was unbelievable. The only thing worse than renting this would be buying it. Extremely disappointing. And as far as comedy goes - if you think watching people suffer is funny, well, then this is for you. One star for the monkey. I want my money back.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The last film of the franchise concluded the saga well. I did not read the books because I did not want to get into the \\"film versus book\\" argument. I prefer to read them AFTER seeing the movie.  Having said that, the acting was superb and the action and plot was great.
0060873027|1.0|I think I have read almost all of Michael Crichton's \\"science thriller adventure\\" novels, and seen most of the movies based on them -- \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" (the original) and \\"Jurassic Park\\" being the best, or at least most enjoyable, in my opinion.   It's my great hope that \\"Micro\\", Crichton's last book (finished after his death by Richard Preston) never gets adapted into a movie... although in a time when stupid ideas get made into huge, stupid movies, it probably will.   \\"Micro\\" begins somewhat promisingly, with the mysterious deaths of several men, killed with a succession of tiny cuts inflicted by unseen forces.   And then it goes downhill.   No, that's too mild -- it CAREENS downhill.   We're introduced to seven graduate students from Massachusetts -- none of them at all memorable as characters -- who are induced to come to Hawaii to work with a new company called Nanigen. Within a short time of their arrival, they are lured into a room where a big machine shrinks them down to roughly one-half an inch tall... and a chapter or so later, they are struggling to survive in the Hawaiian jungle, fighting for their lives against insects and other creatures, as well as natural phenomena which are now potentially fatal at their vastly reduced size.   Now, that's a premise which could have been a lot of fun. I'm a big fan of stories of people being shrunk down and having to deal with life at a tiny size -- \\"The Incredible Shrinking Man\\" is one of my favorite movies. It's a scenario filled with opportunities for wonder, excitement and peril.   Of course, it helps -- no, it's NECESSARY -- to support such a ludicrous premise with consistent logic, and people it with characters you can care about. \\"Micro\\" succeeds on neither of these counts.   The story really begins to fall apart with the hasty exposition explaining the \\"science\\" behind the \\"tensor generator\\" which shrinks the students down to that one-half inch height. The \\"science\\" amounts to this -- very strong magnetic fields causes things to shrink.   Uh-huh.   This is a great example of the value of the \\"less is more\\" approach. If you have to do something which is, essentially, theoretically impossible, DON'T try to explain it in a way which is CLEARLY nonsensical to anyone with half a brain. Just briefly make up something about the technology behind your magic device, and move on.   So we have these seven people -- eight, actually, because one of the Nanigen technicians is accidentally shrunken down with the group -- now roughly the size of sugar cubes. (The rationale for the evil head of Nanigen doing this has something to do with a lame sublpot about the brother of one of the students learning the shocking truth about Nanigen, and said student finding out something about the complicity of the evil head of Nanigen in the death -- or APPARENT death -- of said brother.) Obviously -- and it is made obvious in the bad dialogue attendant to this scene -- the evil head of Nanigen has shrunken the students to get rid of them.   And here's his plan: He's going to feed them to one of the many snakes in Nanigen's laboratory. But the first snake the students are offered to doesn't eat them, due to some convenient repellent insect chemicals one of the students is carrying. (But the evil head of Nanigen doesn't realize that, and instead thinks the snake must just not be that hungry.) So then, instead of offering the students to the NEXT snake, and maybe the next one after that, he allows his somewhat reluctant (and obviously somewhat soft-hearted) associate to let the students go... into the jungle. At night. With no supplies or weapons with which to defend themselves from all the predators now extremely dangerous to them at their reduced size. Better than being fed to a snake, I guess, but not by much.   Now, in the hands of a good writer, the following chapters could have been a thrilling series of adventures as these sugar cube-sized students struggle to survive in this now-alien landscape, using their wits and their scientific knowledge to keep themselves alive and somehow get back to their former stature. But Richard Preston is not that kind of writer. Many of his concepts and dialogue choices are simply embarrassingly dopey. Here's one -- it's from the thoughts running through the head of the aforementioned reluctant associate of the evil head of Nanigen, referring to her relationship with same:   \\"... (he) had been incredibly good to her, advanced her career, paid her unlimited amounts of money...\\"   Really? The evil head of Nanigen has paid her an infinite amount of money? Huh? Was this book even proofread?   And this howler comes from later on in the book (page 202, to be precise) in one of the many clunky scenes in which everything stops so that some bit of biological science can be tediously explained. This is a character named Rick talking about the ingredient he needs to cook up some curare, a poison he hopes to use to defend them against the creatures who might want to eat them:   \\"That whiff of bitter almonds... can you smell it? Cyanide -- a universal poison, it'll kill anything, and fast. Cyanide -- a favorite of Cold War spies.\\"   And here's another bizarre one from page 244, when one of the characters is being attacked by a wasp which is laying eggs in him:   \\"The wasp was... burying her stinger in his shoulder. And he felt nothing. His arm had gone dead.   \\"No!\\" he screamed, and grabbed the stinger in both hands, and tried to pull it out.\\"   Now, maybe I'm missing a key element here, but... if one of your arms has \\"gone dead\\", how do you then grab something with BOTH hands?   One more -- on page 302, a police detective interviewing the evil head of Nanigen notices the smell of the cigar the evil head of Nanigen is smoking:  \\"The air had a pleasant aroma of cigar. Given the pleasance of the aroma, Watanabe concluded that the cigar had cost more than ten dollars.\\"   When I first read that second line, I thought \\"Did the author just invent a word? 'Pleasance'? I've never heard that word before.\\"   I asked my wife -- who had her laptop open -- to do a quick dictionary.com search for the word, and -- to my surprise -- it IS in fact a real word. Here's what dictionary.com had to say about it:  \\"pleas·ance [plez-uhns]  noun  1. a place laid out as a pleasure  garden or promenade.  2. Archaic . pleasure.\\"   So the author has chosen to use the archaic meaning of an uncommon word, for no particularly good reason... the mark of someone who writes with a thesaurus open at his side.   I came very close to abandoning \\"Micro\\" without finishing it... but I am loathe to do that with any book I've started reading, so I toughed it out and made it to the end. It wasn't easy. This is one of those rare books which was almost painful to read, and not because it includes troubling or disturbing concepts. It's just a terrible waste of trees. I wish I'd followed my earlier impulse and dumped it in the recycling bin.   Michael Crichton had a real knack for taking a premise which was slightly ludicrous and turning it into a compelling story, with just enough real science mixed in to keep up the suspension of disbelief. Richard Preston does not have that ability, if this book is any indication. -- PL

B0043A0PXU|5.0|I'm a huge Annie Lennox fan. I have everything. But I didn't get her Christmas album last year, because I was a little disappointed that it was basically just a bunch of traditional carols.  Was hoping for more original material. But, as Annie is a goddess, this year I succumbed and bought it, and I'm listening to it now.  It's electrifying. The most exciting arrangements of these tired old songs I've ever heard.  Though I understand the reason some of the others here didn't care for it as much.  It is at times violent, and sometimes dissonant.  It is not your ordinary fare. But it is always hauntingly beautiful. If you're an Annie Lennox fan, this is a must-have.

B004U52VPS|5.0|My four-year-old nephew is an Angry Birds expert and was thrilled to receive this for his birthday. What's not to like about a sling shot you can use to hurl plastic birds at, well, anything? There were four generations at this party and we all wanted a turn. Is it really educational? Absolutely. If an evil pig ever steals his egg he will know exactly what to do and he will already be skilled at doing it.
B0038P80CO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Acting was good, nice twists to the plot, loved the ship and the effects.  Not going to repeat the story line but I think this is definitely a keeper. Highly recommend if you liked Aliens.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I am a huge admirer of Jane Austen and also a considerable fan of P.D. James -- so I am very sad to report that this book is a pale imitation of Austen and very far from vintage James.<br /><br />After reading it, the question arose in my mind: why do prequels and \\"postquels\\" of classic works almost always fail? Why is it that the \\"Mr. Darcy\\" industry, which has become almost a sub-genre of literature in its own right, so mediocre?<br /><br />I think it's because the author, even a great author like P.D. James, is inhabiting (or trying to inhabit) characters created by someone else. It was Jane Austen, and Jane Austen alone, who created Elizabeth Bennet. Anyone else who tries to tinker with that character is, to quote yet another current title, playing the part of the zombie in \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"<br /><br />We meeet Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy five years into their happy marriage. But it is not the same Elizabeth and Darcy we have known. Elizabeth, retired into domestic bliss as a mother and the chataleine of Pemberly, has lost that crucial wit and spark -- that feistiness and sense of self -- that Austen gave her and which made us love her. Darcy is  still a haughty snob obsessed with social niceties.<br /><br />There is a murder and Mr. Wickham is accused. We get an investigation and trial and a bunch of blah, blah, blah until it all ends with a recap of the main points of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"<br /><br />Various characters from P&P show up, but for some reason they are all the boring ones and not the amusing ones. We get Jane (boring), Mr. Bingley (boring), Georgianna (boring) but not Mr. Collins. We get a very boring version of Mr. Bennet but not Mrs. Bennet.<br /><br />I know that P.D. James loves Austen. I wish she had not succumbed to the temptation to try to add to what was already perfect.
B0036T31YY|4.0|I find it hard to review this movie.  I enjoyed it yet at the end, I can't say that I really liked it.  Definitely worth watching and making up your own mind.  It does have a bit of the feeling of \\"The Shining\\" and was creepy yet....well watch it and find out.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I truly enjoy movies of the Revolutionary Period of America, and this one is fantastic!!  As I sit and watch it, I am just transported to that time, and enter into the feelings and emotions displayed.  It is certainly true to history and very inspiring.  The history of our country is fascinating to me, and to see all those brave men and women with what they went through in their lives and the conditions they lived in is almost unbelievable, compared to our lives today.<br />  This movie of John Adams, his personal life, and his life in politics is truly wonderful.  It left me in tears as I realize life is short for all of us with it's happy and tragic moments.  We will all have to say goodbye to our loved ones in time, and this movie certainly reveals this fact, as it is very realistic.  John Adams was a great man, and his wife was exceptional.  This movie is wonderful to watch, the actors and actresses have done a fantastic job, and the producer has produced a wonderful movie!!<br />I can't say enough about this movie.  Anyone interested in the Revolutionary period of our country and the history of one of our founding fathers, John Adams, needs to see this inspiring movie.<br /> Thank you for this awesome movie.<br /><br />RaynaRenee

B005ELQVGW|3.0|Talking o critic about a Bj&ouml;rk's albums is uncertain,  an unique artist of our era take elements more beyond the simple music, and review this work is ambiguous. I have all of Bj&ouml;rk 's CD's and some 180 Grams Vinyl's. Plus some Maxi singles, Videos, etc. Record to record you rediscover a new Bj&ouml;rk, and get familiar with new elements as well.  I had to say that 'Vespertine' still at the top of my very personal list, and Biophilia doesn't get close to my second choice, I'm happy with the CD, and astonish as always of the talent and ideas surrounded her. Every record has a memorable track, or great music moments like 'Nattura.' My favorite tracks in this record are the romantic ones: 'Cosmogony' and 'Virus.' And the most likable track is the single 'Crystalline.' In brief: To really enjoy or experience the rest of the album you will has to be open to an uncertain universe doors make by an uneasy artist... So... let's swim the galaxy. PS: The art work of the digipack is great and is plasticized. Inner lay has the lyrics and graphics are splendorous, you can smell the universe.
B005LY4B0A|2.0|Great game but the recent update causes it to lock my Asus on load.  A force shutdown is the only way to recover.
B000S95KTY|2.0|I am a longtime Star Trek fan, but this movie is a real snoozer. There is virtually no action in this film. There's no moral force acting in the plot, and the film doesn't bother to even speculate what meaning the ending has. Admiral Kirk is depicted as connivingly seizing command of the Enterprise, then incompetently commanding. Spock is shown with zero personality. Whatever sex appeal the movie might have had was tossed out the window when they shaved Ilia's head. If you don't believe me on how bad this film is, just go read its entry in W1kipedia. The actors hated the script, the costumes, and had no camraderie. The only saving grace of the film is that it was clearly the inspiration for [[ASIN:B00003CXDV Galaxy Quest]].
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Good price and features for an upgrade to an AMD3+ platform. I have used for more than two weeks with no apparent issues.
B002BWP49C|2.0|Let me start by saying the books are always better, so it would of been really difficult to out do the book. That said I thought the movie missed to many of the really important moments; especially the more intimate moments between Bella and Edward. Some of those moments came in the way of emotions or \\"looks\\" between the two but were significant to the story, I felt those moments were quickly moved over or taken out altogether. The movie seemed rushed to me, especially for splitting it up into two movies. I love Twilight and the actors, but this was poorly done.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great graphics and fun game! I really like the different modes and blades.  I see everyone complaining about ads, but I don't get it. They don't stop you from seeing/playing the game and afterwards it only takes a second to hit &quot;skip&quot; or x. Not a bother at all.
B006FLGBGA|4.0|I had no expectations for this movie at all.  But wow, I was pleasantly surprised that it actual had a plot and Caesar - the chimpanzee-  was a very compelling character and his scenes with his fellow primates made the movie. At the end I wasn't cheering for the humans, but for the animals.
0439023513|3.0|This book was not at all what I expected, and a bit of a stretch from the first two.   I don't want to discount any other reviewers, or the fact that PTSD is a real and terrible thing; this book just isn't the place for it.  The first and second books are about Katniss overcoming great obstacles. This, on the other hand, was about her falling prey to one.  A failure like this belongs in a second book, or somewhere outside of the \\"Young Adult\\" genre.    Overall, a great series, but a disappointing ending laced with failure and unanswered questions.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I get so tired of shows not living up to their hype.  American Horror Story goes above and beyond! Finally someone has figured out how to create real fear, not just pure gore. All kinds of elements exist in this series.  I just hope it continues to gain steam and does not fizzle like so many.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|This is absolutely a can't-miss movie.  I see many good movies, but very rarely a truly great one.  Impossible to describe this film without losing something in the translation.  It is haunting, touching, soul-stirring, moving in all the best ways.  I saw it twice in the theater, and was just as floored the second time.  It's one that stays with you long after you walk out of the theater.  Can't wait to get the DVD.  This will be a watch over and over and over film.

B005G4TJI4|4.0|Seriously, people? It really makes me laugh to read people going on and on about how horrible this movie was. I understand if you are a fan of the Transformers in the 80s that you might be upset, but I'm not and I liked this movie. You aren't supposed to over-analyze movies like this! Just watch the good graphics, attractive people, and be entertained! This franchise isn't something that is supposed to make you think. I mean really. Anyway, I just wanted to put in my 2 cents. I think this was far better than the 2nd one, which was very lacking. The graphics are good and it's entertaining, especially if you have some time to kill and just want to turn your brain off and be entertained.

1400069181|5.0|If you've been looking for an inspiring book to read, I have the perfect suggestion for you. Blake Mycoskie, creator and founder of Toms Shoes, wrote the book \\"Start Something That Matters\\" as a way to share his inspiring story and hopefully peak your interest in making a difference in the world. His book, tells the story of how Toms shoes came about and how important it is to have a good story when starting a business or movement.  This book is an easy read, for it only consists of eight chapters and includes a lot of photographs of real people. Chapter one is the story of Toms shoes and chapters two through eight read as a guide to how to begin a successful, yet meaningful, business.  \\"Start Something That Matters\\" really lets you realize that in order to do what you want to do in life, you need a good idea and have good story to go along with it. For Blake, he wants to help people and his way of doing that is through shoe drops overseas after he sells so many Toms shoes. One for One.

B002JM1VJG|3.0|While content of this collection has many previously unreleased videos, Warner has no concept of who this product would be marketed to.  I truly love the retrospective collection.

0385738773|3.0|I think that it's quite a problem that I'm struggling to write a review of THE DEATH CURE just a few days after I had finished reading. I was a fan of the Maze Runner series with its action-packed mystery and surprising conclusions. Unfortunately, everything that I loved about the series were lacking in the final installment of the Maze Runner series.  I couldn't get into THE DEATH CURE, but at the same time, it wasn't a struggle to read. I read the book in two days, more or less, but I felt entirely disconnected from the reading experience. I just couldn't immerse myself into the world that Dashner had created. Furthermore there was a lack of variation in the tension of the novel. The characters were always on their toes, watching their backs, and I feel as if the constant high tension just made the novel anti-climactic. I wasn't on the edge of my seat.  In the previous book, The Scorch Trials, Dashner hinted at a bit of romance. While there are still some suggestions of romantic tension between the characters, Dashner does not delve into it any deeper. At its core, THE DEATH CURE remains to be about Wicked's \\"good\\" intentions to find a cure for the Flare.  I think I've always had a problem connecting to Thomas, partly because of the third-person perspective. I just didn't understand his character which made it difficult to root him on. I was apathetic to his cause the entire time I was reading. There was no one character I particularly liked, nor was there a character that I disliked.  The ending was satisfying because it ties up the story well. I had no lingering questions. But as an ending to a series that I had enjoyed, it was a bummer. I enjoyed the first two books immensely and it's disappointing to end the series on a sour note. THE DEATH CURE is still worth a read for fans of the series, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This was beautiful and well done. The love that Victoria had for Albert and the depth of her loss are the stuff of legendary romances.  The improvements they made in England may also be well known.

0439023513|1.0|This book is indeed haunting. It's still haunting me and it's likely been more than a year since I read it. Make no mistake, I absolutely loved the first two book in this series.  I told everyone I knew about this series and I had people jumping on the bandwagon left and right.  And then Mockingjay came out. I picked it up the first day and dug in, so happy to head back to pan em to see how this would ultimately unfold.  And I can honestly say in my 38 years on this big blue/green ball of a planet I have never been so disappointed by any other conclusion of any other story in my life.  Suzanne completely lost her way here.  This Katniss has lost herself, and Collins lost me as a fan.    If you want to read a book with some good rising action, only to have that action conclude off the page, then this is your book.  If you want to feel the pain and destruction of war, then this is your book and that feeling will be pounded into your soul with a sledge hammer, believe me.  If you want to find yourself wondering why on earth such a brilliant author would seemingly phone in the third part of this trilogy, then this is your book. If you want to see characters that you have grown to care about be written off in nothing more than one or two sentences, then this is your book. If you want to see a meek, haunted Katniss, a caricature that evoked not more than a strung out junkie in my mind, then this is your book. If you want to be completely dissatisfied with the ending of a story, here ya go.   Gone is the Katniss you knew. She's ruined by war.  Gone is Gale, and trust me when I say gone I mean like he's part of a magic trick in this conclusion.  Poof!  Gale? Gale who?    In short, it sucked.  So much promise, so much potential, flushed down the toilet by an author who forgot who she was writing about and became consumed with WHAT she was writing about and the desire to share the message that she is writing about War here and well, \\"War Sucks\\".  And as this is ultimately a book about war, then well I guess the book is going to suck too.  Good luck to any reader finding any shred of The Hunger Games and Catching Fire here. Because they aren't here.  Honestly if I knew what I know now prior to reading it, if there was some gauge that was going to tell me how disappointed and upset I would be by this piece of trash, I wouldn't have read it in the first place.  I would have kept Hunger Games and Catching Fire right up there on the shelf next to Harry Potter where they belonged.  But now, oh now, the weight of Mockingjay is just too heavy. There's no place up there for this trilogy any more. And yes that makes me angry. But now, a year later as I reflect that ultimately makes me sad. Sad for me, sad for you should you allow this story to enter your heart.    Sorry Suzanne but you owe it to the world to do this one over again or at least let somebody else give it a go.  We all know you have the skills to be a 5 star writer.  Just tell me, what the hell went wrong?
B004NELBPC|2.0|The iPhone app is wonderful.  This is junk. I've used it for all of 5 minutes and here's while I'll be deleting it.  1. slide shows for any article on shows the same unrelated pictures of celebrities at a premier, regardless of what the article is about.  2. most videos won't play.  3. articles won't scroll in landscape mode (must hold kindle fire upright to read the whole article(  4.

B005ICN0DY|4.0|Contrary to many of the reviews here, I believe JOTH is the Kooks' best effort to date. The songs are more intricate and mature than those of previous releases. Don't get me wrong - the upbeat, slightly edgy pop of the earlier releases is fine. But whereas a lot of bands fall flat trying to \\"expand their horizons\\" as it were, I believe the Kooks succeed on JOTH. Let's face it, though - the Kooks are a pop/rock band and if you want something harder edged, then you'll have to find it elsewhere. But if you like this band and thought JOTH was a bit too safely played for your taste, give it a few more listens. I think you'll change your mind.

098478280X|5.0|I first bought a PDF version of this book from the careercup site and loved it. IT explains every thing you need to know before you face a coding interview in top tech company like Microsoft, Google or Amazon. After several unsuccessful first phone screen interviews of all these three companies, I looked around to figure out what was wrong. Then I came across CareerCup site and thought this book will be a great place to start. So I bought this. It explained a lot of mistakes candidates do during the phone interviews as well as Onsite interviews, which clearly explained why i didnt go forward in the interview process.<br />The interview preparation presented in this book is excellent and it explains basic technical things you want know in a very sweet and short way, so you  dont need to make short notes for yourself. All the important details are easily referable and there is a bunch of very nice practice questions and answers(that are not easily accessible, so you will first actually try to resolve the issue by yourself).<br />I also bought a paperback as well so I can easily read the book on the go as i dont have a portable e-reader.<br /><br />Highly recomended. and Good luck with your next interview. This book will surely bring you more luck!
0140544518|5.0|The True Story of the Three Little Pigs is a story that I loved when I was little. Getting to hear the wolf's side of the story blew my mind back then, and taught the important lesson that there's always another side to a story. In most versions of the Three Little Pigs, the wolf (always portrayed as big and bad) goes from house to house in an attempt to eat the pigs. Apparently that was a big misunderstanding, and here the wolf lets us know what happened in his own words. Full of great illustrations, this is a book that children are sure to enjoy. It's not too long and is fun to read out loud and act the part of the poor well-mannered wolf, while making the pigs sound like complete jerks. And hey, if your kids get a kick out of seeing pig butts, then there's the added bonus of that here.  The wolf narrates the story, and it turns out that he just needed a cup of sugar to make some goodies for his dear ol' granny. So he goes to one of his neighbors, one of the three little pigs, to see if they'd be so kind as to let him borrow some sugar. Unfortunately, the wolf has to sneeze before he gets any kind of reply from the pig, and blows the house down as a result. The house is obliterated and the little pig is as dead as a doornail, with his rear sticking up out of the debris. Not one to let a perfectly good meal go to wast, the wolf eats the pig and moves on to the next pig's house to see if he has some sugar. Can you guess what's going to happen there?  Though it's a very basic story, and doesn't get too descriptive, the author did a good job of making some great points regarding character and getting the facts straight. The wolf points out that they're not all big and bad, and when he makes it to the last pig's house, the police show up just as he's banging on the door, upset that the pig said something bad about his granny. So -of course- it'd look like he was trying to put an end to the pig. You really feel bad for the poor wolf when it comes down to it, since he was just trying to be a good guy and do something nice for his granny.  When I was little, I was a little put-off by the illustrations and colors, but now I can really appreciate them. The heavy use of browns makes the story have that flashback sort of look like you'd see in older movies. Not every story is going to have bright, vibrant colors, so this was a big change of pace from what I was used to in the late 80s/early 90s. Anyone could tell this kind of story with minimal illustrations, but a lot of work went into what's here. Lane Smith is a very talented illustrator, and his work has only gotten even better since this book.  I can't say anything negative about this book. It's a fun read, and is one of my daughter's favorite books to have read at bedtime lately. If you like this, you should also check out The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig. Read them one after the other and who knows what zany dreams your child will have that night.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I ordered this movie when it was on sale for only $5.00! Definately a great buy! my kids love this movie and I think it is super cute as well!
055357342X|5.0|10 stars One of the best books I have ever read.   This book is the best in the series so far. I loved every page, every paragraph. GRRM rewards readers who have stuck through the pain and the length and quite a bit of detail on the history and background of the characters is provided. There are so many big reveals in this book, I think if I had put status updates for each reveal every one of my status updates would have been, \\"WTF?!\\" Yes, there is pain and loss in this book and GRRM raises the description of gore and violence to a level I did not imagine was possible. But despite the pain and the violence, I cannot wait to read Feast of Crows.   Spoilers below.  And wow all the events have happened and been put in play because Petyr/Littlefinger wanted Cat and plotted to get her husband killed. I was very dissapointed for Jon that he didn't go to Winterfell. But so nice to have Ghost back. I just wish Arya could be reunited with her wolf; I am sure it is coming. It was also very frustrating to have Bran and Jon so close yet never meet and Arya and her mother so close and never meet. The deaths of the Hound, the Mountain, and Joffrey were very very satisfying. Perhaps the Hound appears to redeem himself and yes he has had a horrible life, but ultimately he is not a good actor and I am glad to see him gone.

B000EUDAWG|1.0|Toy received today and it is missing a leg as well as the screws being fairly stripped making it nearly impossible to open to install brand new batteries and the end result is a toy that wont turn on that is missing a leg and has stripped screws. Was this item previously owned? Will have one sad little romper on my hands come sunday morning.<br /><br />Also item was not as pictured .. .wasn't fuzzy or furry at all.
B002OSY2T6|2.0|I hate this toy so much! My 6 month old daughter barely even likes it. It plays like 2 songs that are super annoying and it doesn't even roll on its own! That was a huge disappointment. I say, go look for a better toy.

1401201911|5.0|Every now and then a book comes along that reminds us why we love comics. This is up there with the very best. Superman is perhaps the most boring comic book character of all time and yet some how Millar is able to breath life into him and make him interesting again.   This is the Citizen Kane of comic books.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|A headlong adventure movie in the spirit of the Indiana Jones movies and the matinee serials that inspired them. In fact, Tintin no doubt was an inspiration in the creation of Indiana Jones and it's wonderful to see Tintin brought to the big screen so grandly and successfully.   I was decidedly unfriendly to the choice of animation style but was won over completely; Spielberg and company have somehow managed to make perhaps the most troubling animation style in existence seem both astonishingly realistic and comfortingly classic at the same time. That is an amazing accomplishment. That it is accomplished in the service of such a fun cinematic romp is a treat to experience.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|I love this movie and the Blu-ray is great. I was looking forward to also adding this to the other HP films on my MacBook. Alas, not with the lame UV system. I will not buy another film without a real digital copy.
B000SM7QUC|4.0|With \\"the Heroin Diaries Soundtrack,\\" which is of course the brainchild of Nikki Sixx, we get a look into his life and the way it was impacted by addiction.  The sound is good old hard rock, which we don't see too much of anymore, and has heavy guitar riffs and some mesmerizing songs, especially \\"Life is Beautiful\\" and \\"Heart Failure.\\"  Throughout the album, there are interludes in which Sixx will read through his old journal that recorded his thoughts during the plight of his addiction, mostly during the heyday of Motley Crue.  There seems to be a good synergy between his spoken words and the songs it is playing between, putting things through a context.  In fact, just through listening to the album all the way through, you can see some kind of timeline of his life with addiction, from ignorance of the drug's effects, reckless abuse, wake-up call, getting clean and looking back on it all.    Towards the end of the album, however, his themes become a tad redundant, and the songs, too preachy, particularly \\"the Girl with Golden Eyes\\" and \\"Permission.\\"  These songs are almost maudlin and sort of hinder their replay value.  Nevertheless, every other song is powerful, almost hypnotic, and delivers a positive message through an authentic voice.    It's a great album, and must be bought/downloaded in its entirety to truly capture it for what it is.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|I think this is Woody Allen at his best with magnificent scenery of Paris (I felt like I was there again) coupled with an interesting and complicated plot about very human traits.     It does help if you know a little about the artists and writers of the 1920's because Allen incorporates their known personalities into the script which makes it even more interesting.     I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and look forward to watching it again soon.  So, grab your favorite glass of wine, some fresh popcorn, turn off your cell phone (and any other distraction) and enjoy!
6305014140|5.0|this is a full 94 min film.<br /><br />This film has alot of action, violence, Gore, Nudity, Sexuality and major adult theams. So I will say I would not recomend this for children or the squimish.<br /><br />This film was made in the late 80's-early 90's era with the same style of anime that came out of that era.<br /><br />The fight sceans are very graphic, expect loads of blood and lots of action.<br /><br />This is still a fine Ninja/Samurai Anime I would recomend this to the lovers of Anime action b/c you wont be disapointed here.

0307593312|4.0|This book got me in right away and I loved the story overall. I just wish it could have moved along a bit quicker. After the first few chapters, it seemed to wander off a bit and I really wanted things to happen quicker. There was a bit too much background information and the writer going off on tangents at some points. But it is rare these days that I get pulled into the storyline of a book, so I'd still recommend it as a great read. The story has stuck with me and it had a lot to say, so it was very meaningful in that way.

0553573403|1.0|Winter is coming, or at least so the Starks keep telling me. I just finished the 2nd book and it isn't winter I am waiting for. I am waiting for vengeance. It is the only reason that compels me to continue to wade through this aimless series of tragedies.<br /><br />Do you like 2nd rate sex scenes/references?<br />Do you like main characters getting killed off or never catching a break?<br />Do you like the rug continually being pulled out from under you in the name of a sweeping epic?<br />Do you like books that have no individual goal to be resolved?<br />Do you like stories that end abruptly with no conclusion?<br /><br />Then this series for you.<br /><br />Otherwise I recommend you turn to Jordan, Sanderson or Tolkien. Anything but this.<br /><br />Martin gives you a good taste of his writing strategy in the first chapter:<br />1. Introduce you to a set of characters<br />2. kill them all off but one<br />3. kill the last one off later in what is obviously a tragedy/travesty<br /><br />This pattern repeats itself over and over again in this book. And... I'd be ok with that if it went somewhere... but instead it just drags on and on and on. And to make matters worse, when I get the vengeance I want, it will be bittersweet because the author has sadistically drawn you into a character in the enemy camp.<br /><br />If you are interested in this story, just watch the tv series and move on. Save yourself hours of your life and read something else.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but after finally watching it last night (it sat on my TV stand for the longest time), I'm glad I made time. The story centers around 15-year-old Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts), who suffers through the pangs of adolescence which includes seeing his parents' marriage about to crumble (mom Jill is played by Sally Hawkins and dad Lloyd is played by Noah Taylor). This fact is not helped when mom's ex-boyfriend becomes their next-door neighbor.<br /><br />As he struggles with this issue, Oliver is also facing problems at school - he is not the most popular kid, and becomes romantically attracted to Jordana Bevan (Yasmin Paige), a dark-haired beauty who is not above tormenting the weaker ones amongst the student population. Despite this, Oliver is hopelessly drawn to Jordana and goes about trying to win her heart.<br /><br />Frankly, I did not find the central characters very likable, but the storyline is interesting and the cast does a credible job in their respective performances. It is amazing what a good ensemble cast can bring to a production, and Submarine fares well as a result. It is a compelling portrait of humans, both young adults and adults, in all their vulnerable moments, their flaws and strengths, and makes for engaging viewing.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Loved it!!  The item is in great condition!!  Buying experience was easy and I have since ordered more items through Amazon.com.
B005PK58TI|5.0|I love any well-made horror movie or series, and love American Horror Story (Season One just ended). It is a well-made, layered horror story centering on a dysfunctional family - Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott), Vivien Harmon (Connie Britten), and teen daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga, wonder is she is related to Vera Farmiga?). Ben is a psychiatrist who is in the doghouse because Vivien discovered him having an affair with his student. Vivien is also suffering mental anguish over her recent miscarriage. The couple try to put things right by moving from Boston to LA, where they buy a restored Gothic mansion. Daughter Violet is a taciturn teen who resents her parents for putting her through this, and has a hard time at her new school.<br /><br />Little does the Harmon family realize that their home is horribly haunted. Yes, 'horribly' because it is not merely one or two otherworldly entities that inhabit this house, but a whole plethora of lost, unhappy, wandering souls that are somehow trapped within the confines of the malevolent house. The Harmon's next-door neighbor Constance (played to wicked perfection by Jessica Lange, in an award-worthy performance) appears to think she has the right to come and go as she pleases, which annoys Vivien no end, yet Constance also seems to know the true nature of the house. Then there's the mysterious housekeeper who talks herself into a position with the Harmons, and depending on one's point of view, can appear as a sexy, young nymphomaniac or a disfigured middle-aged housekeeper! There is nudity and sex scenes in this show, as well as graphic violence.<br /><br />As the episodes progress, viewers will be kept at the edge of their seats trying to figure out which character is really alive, and which character is merely a ghost. The other interesting aspect is working out the motives of the various entities. There are many supernatural entities in this show, and it could have been a real mess trying to make everything flow and connect. Fortunately, the writers and producers of this show have done a remarkable job of connecting everything together in a credible way (well, to the extent that this is possible in a supernatural-themed show).<br /><br />There are a lot of flashbacks to the past to show the history of the various occupants of the house, which is really important in helping viewers place the characters and their stories, and how the Harmons tie in with all of this.<br /><br />The story is creepy but the chills come more from watching the Harmon family slowly but surely crumble as a family unit, and of how their lives are irrevocably changed as a result of living in the house. The house is the main star of the show, it is like a huge forcefield that attracts and imprisons its occupants, with the trapped souls not ever having a chance at escaping. Having watched the season finale, I can't help but wonder how the producers are going to keep the storyline fresh and interesting, as the house becomes even more cluttered with trapped souls. I highly recommend this show for fans of ghost stories, haunted houses, and a well-executed horror drama.writers and producers of this show have done a remarkable job of connecting everything together in a credible way (well, to the extent that this is possible in a supernatural-themed show).

0525423656|3.0|Where do I start? When I fell in love with Matched last year, my expectations for Crossed were extremely high. After being tortured with that emotional cliffhanger, I expected to be pulled out of my misery but was sorely mistaken. Crossed isn't a fast-paced and exciting adventure but a slow-burning learning journey. In this sequel, we learn more about Ky and Cassia's personal stories and the Uprising, which is surrounded by many clues, secrets and conflicts. While these pieces of information did interest me, I was desperate to see the action and passionate romance from the first book.  When Ky is sent to the Outer Provinces to \\"work\\" with other anomalies and aberrations, bombs are dropped on his camp almost every night. The Society uses them as decoy villagers and moves them around constantly for the Enemy to kill. At the same time Ky plans his escape, Cassia makes it her mission to find the boy she loves, even if it means venturing out into the dangerous unknown herself. The beginning section of the novel is probably the most suspenseful and heart-wrenching. You can only hope that the two will reunite and not be hurt by sheer bad luck. It was also at this time that my heart felt as if it would explode out of my chest and you could probably hear my shouts of \\"no way!\\" from Antarctica! As Ky and Cassia are separated for a good amount of the novel (no who/what/when spoilers here!), we learn about their upbringing through memories and things we questioned in Matched are somewhat explained.  Venturing deep into the canyons, we're able see the abandoned villages, filled with books and information - a total contrast to the high-tech Society. I enjoyed learning about the \\"other\\" lifestyle, but found it very hard to engage with the story, as there wasn't much dialogue but internal thoughts. The lonely setting of the novel didn't help and I really felt that the book could've been shorter, as we strayed from the point of the story from time to time. Discoveries about the Society's dark secrets and the Uprising are made though, setting up a lot of background for the next book. When Cassia decides she wants to join the movement, Ky is adamantly against it. What does he know that we don't? Here's where the secrets start unravelling!  While Crossed isn't a riveting read that'll glue your eyes to the pages, you'll feel the intense emotions of desperation, pity and frustration that resonate through all of the characters. I can only hope that Condie finds a good balance between the action and internalised emotions in the third book! With many still unanswered questions, there's a lot of fixing that needs to be done because things aren't exactly bright and sunny by the end of Crossed...
B004XIQIPQ|4.0|I don't seem to write too many reviews anymore. I also don't listen to too much fresh new music however I have followed the plight of this particular band in America. I rate this a 4 meaning I like but don't love this release. I enjoy it because it tickles my earlobe in a way where I would like to be tickled in that way in the near future. Meaning I listen to this music often.   Favorite song: That's Where You're Wrong. This song is a sweet closer in the vein of \\"A Certain Romance\\". It just strikes the right chords and is punctuated nicely by Alex Turners lyrics.   Least \\" \\" : \\"Reckless Serenade\\" Sorry, this song doesn't do it for me. It's catchy. But its not clever. There's a difference.   If you are looking for another \\"Whatever people say I am......\\" type record, look elsewhere. This is almost an entirely different Arctic Monkeys we are talking about. Same with the record \\"Humbug\\". Perhaps the great divider is how you feel about Queens Of The Stone Age, whose leader Josh Homme has taken this band under his wings. I like \\"Queens\\" therefore I enjoy his influences on this band.
B0031RS7X6|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end and I could not put it down once I'd got started. I can't understand the reviewers who did not find it funny. Of course humor is subjective but this was such a nice light amusing read and I  thought Emma was a fabulous heroine.
B006AN78XS|1.0|Most boring movie I have ever watched!  Shifting between two plots/eras, our whinnying writer pointlessly ventures between  the years 2010, 1920, and 1890's, trying to find himself.
B006MBX90O|4.0|Even though not every episode is gut wrenching horror or filled with thrills this series satisfies my needs for a good ghost and murder (and psychotic) drama.  It is nicely shot, and a good plot.  I'd give it a try,  I must say I'm addicted!
B0049P1VHS|1.0|Made it through 2 1/2 episodes (which I hope to save some future victim from enduring).  Plot lines are absurd... zombies are are menacing as a mannequin... one redneck racist/sexist/biggot steryotype after another...  On top of it all, absolutely grotesque and unnecessary blood and guts every two minutes.  Work on a puzzle of the Mona Lisa or something (anything) else instead.

0307887898|4.0|I'm currently working on a software start-up so the lessons in this book were gold for me.  I learned the value of customer development and talking to customers BEFORE you build your product.  I also learned the difference between vanity metrics and real metrics when measuring progress.<br /><br />This book offers an excellent framework for building a web startup.  But it doesn't address the hardest parts of building a lean startup which are finding early customers to interview, finding an idea to start with and when to pivot.<br /><br />Another problem I have with this book is the weak connection between lean startup practices and management of large established companies.  There was too much discussion of how lean startup methodology could be applied to the corporate environment.  This was a stretch.  I think the author was overreaching.<br /><br />If you are working on a startup I highly recommend this book.

B005FLX2S6|5.0|\\"White Light\\" stands as a snapshot of Gene Clark at his song writing peak. The songs are all heartfelt, full of interesting melodies and delivered with his sweet, soulful vocals. I've noticed a couple of reviews that have knocked the production and mix. Both are very much of their time. You have to keep in mind the album was recorded and released in 1971 and reflect the era it was recorded in.<br /><br /> Bob Irwin's remaster of this terrific album is the best the album has ever sounded on CD. Irwin brings a nice, organic \\"warm\\" sound to the album and the EQ choices are better here than the previously issued version of this title with bonus tracks.<br /><br />From the opening bars of \\"The Virgin\\" to the powerful \\"1975\\", \\"White Light\\" (aka \\"Gene Clark\\") is one of Clark's finest solo albums. Jess Ed Davis' guitar solos perfectly compliment Gene's low-key songs. The instrumentation is perfect for the material Gene wrote.<br /><br />The remastered sound is terrific and a huge step up especially when you compare it to tracks recorded after this and released much later on \\"Roadmaster\\". The sound stage is superior here as well due to the careful work of Irwin.<br /><br />The only drawback is that the bonus tracks featured on the import version (and previous remaster) are NOT included here which may keep some fans of Clark away from this version of the album. That's too bad because this is probably the best this album has ever sounded on CD.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of digipaks but this one is quite nice.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|I realize that this novel has a huge fan base, but I was disappointed. The descriptions of the magical tricks and fantastical tents were intensely evocative and truly brought you into the circus as if you were experiencing it yourself, but that was really the only positive for me. The story itself was jumbled, the jumping around in time was confusing, the characters were flat, and the end was a cluttered, disorganized let-down.   I would agree with some other reviewers that the main character of the book was the circus itself, and in that regard the novel succeeds - the circus is richly drawn, powerfully described, and you can only wish that something like that really did exist. Of course, if something like this ever HAD existed it would have changed the world as we know it. And since we all know that nothing like that ever DID exist, it's hard to read about it with any sense of reality. We know it's all just bizarre images sprung from the mind of a particularly imaginative author. That's the problem with setting it in the timeframe in which it's set - we know it never happened, and that realization pulls you out of the story. If it had either not been so fantastical (so that we could have believed something like this existed but we just never learned of it), or it had been set in the future (so it hasn't happened yet but still could), or in some fantasy world clearly not our own, I might have enjoyed it more. But setting it in the not-so-distant past of THIS world was, to me, a mistake.  Yes, it's fantasy, yes we know things like this don't really happen...but the best fantasy books have to include some element of \\"it *could* happen!\\" Some have compared this book to Harry Potter - see, there's a fantasy book set in this world, in the recent past! But the difference is that Harry Potter's world doesn't intersect so sharply with the real world...you can choose to believe that the rest of the world just doesn't know about that magical place. But in this book, a circuslike this would have attracted too much real attention, and been a major part of history.  The main enjoyment for me was attending the circus. The rest of it...meh. You never get any real sense of the two masterminds behind the game, A.H and Prospero - what are they? Why do they exist? Where do they get their powers? I realize that you can't ever adequately explain true magic, but it was all just too out-there for me.   Sorry to say that this was not as enjoyable a read as I was hoping. But it sure has some incredible descriptions of really cool magical tents. If only there was some context behind them, rather than just...really cool magical tents that we know full well never existed.

B005Z271Y6|4.0|When I saw that this was releasing, I preordered it immediately. As expected, this is amazing, even better that it comes with a cd of the concert as well. My only issue is the video quality could have been better. The crowd shots are quite grainy, not a big deal. The audio is great. I'm happy they decided to release a live dvd of her show considering she had to cancel many of her shows this year. Adele is the truth. This is a must own for any fan.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is one of my most favorite books, if not my favorite. First off the whole story is easy to catch onto and it really grabs you from the beginning. There is always a suspenseful moment at the end of a chapter right before it switches to another character. Some \\"bad\\" characters I actually grew to like (Tyrion) and some good ones I sort of disliked (Catelyn) due to some of the things they said or did. I enjoyed the fact that the point of view constantly changes and you get to see other characters side of the story. I bought both the written and the Kindle Fire version of this book.

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|This movie was better than expected. I think the movie was one of the best action movies ever made. Batman Begins was not better than the sequel, in my opinion, and I think that Heath Ledger played the Joker very well. I wish Heath Ledger was still alive today and could see the movie. I also thought Christian Bale was very good in the movie as well. This is one of my favorite movies and I'm looking forward to the next movie in this series.
B005LB1MY6|4.0|This was an awesome album in my opinion. A lot of people are saying this isn't \\"cross\\" will no duh it's not if you are looking for another cross album then listen to it again. What I think Justice is trying to do here is not repeat the same thing over and over again just like Daft Punk. They're bringing something new to the table, instead of releases eps they're more focused on an album (though albums may be dead). \\"The internet has made us very impatient people, and cannot enjoy an album as a whole\\" Gaspard

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have a JVC car stereo that came with an iPod cable. The cable goes through the dash and into the back of the stereo and can control a attached iPod through the stereo or with a remote. The only problem is that the cable only supports the older model iPods. If you attach anything newer than an Touch 1st gen you get an error or device not supported etc. I was hoping this would allow me to attach my iPhone 4S so I could play music. It WORKED perfect! It also allows me to stream Pandora through my stereo too. I was not expecting that. Only had it a couple days but I am pretty happy so far and feel it is made well enough and works better than expected.

0783116934|5.0|CITZEN X was the first made for TV movie from HBO and it obviously set their standards from that point on. This movie is so well made and so well acted that it should have come out in the big screen - it's one of those gems that seem to get by everyone. The thing about the movie is that it's based on a true serial killer in Russia and they just seem to be at a loss as to what to do or how to catch him. I also believe he is considered the worst serial killer in history - over 50 victims. It takes place during the cold war so there is no contact between the USSR and the US but they know we have experience dealing with serial killers. It's a political thriller as well as a homicidal thriller. Will they or won't they make contact with the US for help before the Russiam public find out about it? It's also one of those where you arn't sure who is a good guy and who is a bad guy! It's a great movie! One you'll remember for a long time because of how well it's made and acted.
0786290218|5.0|I'm so embarrassed that it took me 5 years after publication to finally read this book. It's absolutely amazing - and while it may be a Book for Young Adults - I can safely say that it should be read by EVERY adult. I'm ordering my hardcover now so I can not only read it again and again myself but have it ready for when my two children are old enough to learn of Liesel, Rudy, Hans, Max and Death himself.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|My wife and I both really enjoy this Christmas album. For us it is a perfect album to just put on and leave in the background while decorating or entertaining at Christmas.  Sure, nothing is flashy on the album but the song interpretations are interesting without trying to be too trendy or too contemporary.  Recording quality is deep and rich with a nostalgic feel and Zooey's voice is great as always.  Definitely recommended, especially for any She & Him fan.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|I very much enjoyed this DVD. I think its a more intimate look at Beyonce, her career, and personal life. Something she hasn't shared before with the world. :)

B002VPE1XE|5.0|This case came along as part of a bundle, and I have to say, it was well worth the deal. I was worried that the Velcro will deteriorate over time and that a zipper would be the best bet, but so far, the Velcro is working well.  I was surprised to see that the case is pretty big, and a modern slim camera (such as the Sony WX-570) will probably fit a little loosely. This does leave room for any extra supplies though.  Nevertheless, the case is very durable.  I would definitely recommend this case.  Pros:  - Durability  - Big  Cons:  - Velcro
B005HV6Y84|4.0|The first Twilight soundtrack is by far the best... but this one is ok. Not sure why they decided to go with more mainstream songs this time around (Bruno Mars for example). But, I always like to buy the Twilight soundtracks because they introduce me to new music in the genre I like.
0241953642|5.0|GOTTA get this book! A must for anyone who mixes with people ~ helping them , assisting them, working with them, being able to communicate better!!!  Need to use these guys!!
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I have tried several times to update this. Always comes back and says application not installed.  I have wasted enough time one angry birds and those darn green pigs.
1609611543|5.0|I found the health information in this book to be very enlightening. Having read Dr Mercola's 'Grain Free Diet' and 'The Paleo Diet', the idea of removing grains from the diet was not new to me. But what these grains, especially wheat, does to the body was new. It makes total sense. We are both grain free now and do not miss it at all.
0375842209|5.0|I felt a little bored while starting this book, who thinks that death can narrate a story? I thought that I might drop this after few pages, don't know what pushed me past that line. After finishing this yesterday I can say this is one of the best books I have ever read.  The way characters build up, how death keep describing minor details about their souls, how the book thief have this itch for books... I mean this all comes out a very very superb story telling by the author. Humans are strange as death keeps thinking and it is shown very clearly at multiple places, I loved it when Max writes to Liesel saying: \\"I hope this all would end one day, but then you do something like walking in the basement with snow in hand\\" , the little gifts that she keeps bringing to Max are so nicely described.  The end is definitely a little sad but I think it's very appropriate, you cannot expect a happy ending in a war story.
0061928356|5.0|This book is a terrific read. It gives you a peek at Indian culture, past and present. It deals with modern day relationship between husband and wife- the everyday and the cross culture. It talks about raising a child. It speaks to everyone on one level or another
B005HJWWW8|3.0|Ok so i just received my E6 along with an L9 LOD.  I'll start with everything looked good upon opening.  I first plugged my E6 into my senheisers eh 150.  I did not get this amp for these headphones.  I bought them along time ago and these are the only 32 ohm headphones I have.  They sounded like crap without the E6 and even crappier when the amp was used.  They sounded really muddy and I could not appreciate the music.  I had to take them off.  Then I tried my monster turbines.  I understand you really don't need and amp for the turbines because of the low impedance but I plan to get some ultrsones or beyer dynamics and these were the best headphones I had.  I plugged them in and I instantly noticed a difference.  More punchy bass and WAY less highs.  I think the soundstage was better without the amp.  Now on the positive note their are 4 different eq settings.  I still enjoyed listening to music with the turbines going to the amp and it was cool being able to adjust eq to fit my song.  the first setting is flat and that sounds very similar to no amp except not as crisp of highs but I could really turn the volume up.  The second setting is for ultra bass.  This was cool to use for rap songs and dubstep.  mids and highs were definately recessed but the bass was tickling the inside of my ear.  The third setting was the mid booster and this was a cool setting because it accented things in songs I never really paid attention to.  I used this setting on the new Bjork album and it sounded really neat.  It didn't sound amazing by all means but just different.  the fourth setting id for high input devices but I will probably never use this one.  When I had it on this setting everything was just toned down and quieter for obvious reasons.  Well can't really comment on battery life cuz I just got it.  Well to sum it all up this is really a versatile amp for a cheap price.  I'm for sure gunna upgrade the amp when I get some better headphones.  This is my first headphone amp and I can say I did get what I paid for so I'm satisfied.  I recommend this amp to newbs like me and stress that if you have some good cans, don't go cheap and get a better amp.
0142407909|5.0|Preparing for Willie Wonka audition; this book will be a great prep! Easy read, great character analysis.  We purchased this to review the story line and character choices for our 17 year old son with Down Syndrome, who will be auditioning for Willie Wonka with a local community theatre.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|The product works exactly as they said.  I buyed for my IPAD and now I can play everything from my device to the TV or make a presentation in a projector.  Great deal!!!!
B003LSTK8G|3.0|This is a good but difficult read unless you have, what I would consider, a strong economics background.  I struggled at times with the details such as the overall concept of shorting (betting against) these complicated tranches and CDO's.  The great thing that Lewis did was ensure that this didn't dominate the entire book - but it was exhausting.<br /><br />The nice thing about this book was the fact that it was only 264 pages and was a quick read.  Unlike reading 'To Big Too Fail', this book was done in short time which for individuals like me this is great.  I'm not a big fan of 500+ pages as they take much too long and take away from the story.<br /><br />I rated this book as a 3 only because of the difficulty in the topic.  I don't think that Lewis did some of the appropriate up-front work (or I missed it) to explain or simplify some of the concepts.  This very well may be because it is impossible to do as Lewis mentions several times that many of the firms CEOs didn't understand them.  Because of this, I rated a 3 but I consider myself smart and I think it could have been simplified somewhat.<br /><br />Overall, though, I will comment that Lewis rights very well and is an enjoyable read.  I will certainly follow up with some of his other titles after reading this one!
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Boring, cowardly, ridiculous, cancer, horrible, waste, disappointment, rip-off, sad, dumb, not-art, empty, nothing, silly, disaster, brain death, rot, dung, infection.  Pretty much sums it up.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I have seen the 2D version of this film several times, but this 3D version is poppin!  It gives the viewer a really good full emersion effect and makes it seem like you've never seen the film before.  Every scene has good depth of field and some of the \\"splatter\\" scenes make you want to wipe off your glasses.<br /><br />GOOD JOB!<br /><br />Cheue
0786891416|1.0|I had to stop reading this one.  I just don't think I fit the target audience that this book needs.  I love a good mystery as well as the next guy; but from the start, this was just kind of insulting to me.
B00475BUVM|1.0|I don't know why some 3D dvd's have such good 3D full emersion effects (like Resident Evil) and some stink, but unfortunately Clash stinks.  Only the people seem to have any depth at all, but all the cool stuff is flat and uninteresting.  They really had a chance to have a good 3D film here, but blew it.<br /><br />My advice - don't waste the cash!<br /><br />Cheue
0739343823|3.0|As with all of his books, they keep you reeled in.  In this case, I did NOT like the ending.  Not the ending per say; but the lack of details to it.  If he would have just dedicated a few paragrahs as to why he/she did it, I think it would have been fine.

0553584537|2.0|First as a FYI.  This review is based of listening to the book as opposed to reading it.  I didn't really like it.  First, I didn't like the reader which of course has nothing to do with book.  I liked the premise of the book; but too many things that I didn't agree with made it bad for me such as a judge reaching out to the defendent outside of court or the police.  There were also other similar things; but I don't want to spoil too many things.  In the end, I was just looking forward to the end.
