0312305060|4.0|Cunningham is certainly a skilled craftsman, and he's a gifted writer with a fine eye for telling details, an ear for tone and nuance, and a knowledge bank filled with literary and biographical-historical sources that he draws upon selectively and to compelling effect.  The portrait of the historical Woolf and her creation of the character of Clarissa rings true along with the evocative imagery that, as in Woolf's prose, frequently takes us beyond the literal surfaces of life and puts us in touch with deeper wellsprings, both archetypal and emotional.<br /><br />But be forewarned.  If you have read \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" fairly recently and genuinely understand and appreciate what Woolf is doing, Cunningham is no Virginia Woolf--not even close.  Woolf's fairly concise novel includes a send-up of Victorian mor&eacute;s, a lively and bristling comedy of manners, and a biting indictment of politics, religion, and the medical profession (physicians and psychiatrists), as well as love (yes, more often than not she associates the twin demons of \\"religion and love\\"), and finally a wake-up call to an entire age (the 1920s) with its anachronistic \\"London Victorians\\" leading a life of shallowness, pretense and self-deception as though their fabricated sense of the old order can protect them from the reality of the times post-World War I.  In general, her continual argument in Clarissa is with pompous arrogance and irresponsible uses of power, above all those who attempt to dominate others.  (The words Woolf uses to describe such hubris have to be` \\"worked at\\" to be understood: \\"Human Nature,\\" \\"Proportion,\\" and \\"Conversion\\" refer to the crimes against humanity and the self perpetrated by her worst villains--Dr. Holmes, Sir Bradshaw, and Miss Kilman.)  All of this is missing from Cunningham's novel, none of its three stories or any combination of the three carrying any of the resonance of Woolf's London and its cross-section of modern life.<br /><br />As a prose stylist, Woolf's syntax is much like Shakespeare's, Joyce's, and Faulkner's--a rippling stream, a continuing \\"play\\" of language in motion, embodying the very life that is its subject.  Woolf is a musician, allowing her meanings to evolve in time, our discovery of the new contingent upon the phrases and motifs that she has already planted in the reader's consciousness.  Cunningham, on the other hand, is a painter, giving the reader a much steadier and clearer picture but also more limiting and less exhilarating than anything in Woolf.  Or staying with the visual metaphor, Cunningham's is a securely grounded camera providing inarguably accessible set pieces; Woolf's is a hand-held movie camera, constructing a fluid and seamless montage as it moves in and out of characters' private and public worlds and changes from one character's point of view to another's with effortless mastery (an illusion, since we know, first, that Woolf was a slow-working perfectionist and, second, that the reader must work hard, exercising great patience simply to identify Woolf's deliberatively indefinite pronouns--but the pay-off is worth it).<br /><br />Finally, Cunningham paints in broad strokes that, by comparison to Woolf's multihued palette, wide field of vision, and shifting focus, can come suspiciously close to the world of soap opera.  Whereas homosexuality (male and female) is but one form of human association among many in Woolf's multifarious, truly diverse unvierse, Cunningham seems to be banking on unconventional relations and gender roles to at once arouse interest and bring out the reader's best (and self-comforting) instincts (after all, one human being loving another is what matters most, doesn't it?).  And isn't it generous of us to be so understanding of \\"hot button\\" issues in a world with no shortage of neo-con and other righteous, judgmental types?  Perhaps he succeeds, though I can't help but feel a bit manipulated by the reduction of Woolf's representation of life and human relationships tosuch a singleminded emphasis, not to mention his employment of AIDS (from which two characters suffer directly, the others indirectly) as a metaphor for the universal dread of mortality that hovers over all of Woolf's characters, a death sentence of which her major characters are acutely conscious.<br /><br />Cunningham's conclusion works passibly well--Clarissa generously invites to the party intended for Richard, Richard's mom, with whom she has established an at least temporary bond.  And in the tradition of what some readers refer to as \\"women's literature,\\" Virginia chooses death--a kind of martyrdom given her melodramatic ultimatum to Leonard that it's \\"London or death\\"'--while Mrs. Brown and Clarissa also make life-altering choices, decisions that offer some consolation to women who sacrifice happiness but not the freedom to choose and to endure.<br /><br />By contrast, Woolf offers a conclusion that is about more than choosing and enduring.  Clarissa is granted an epiphany in which she is able to \\"see\\" her identification with Septimus and the mistakes she's made, chief among them trading an authentic \\"life\\" worthy of her vibrant nature for a superficial notion of stability and \\"success.\\"  The final sentence--\\"And there she was\\"--announces a new and whole Clarissa, no longer trapped by the traditions of the past or the conventions of the present, or split into two Clarissas, regardless of the face she chooses to assemble.  Although Peter's hopes are immediately realized, it is not someone else but the reborn Clarissa herself who is invited to her own party, and we as readers cannot help but respond to the self-affirming celebration of life that Clarissa represents at that moment. Virginia Woolf, by now it should go without saying, knows how to throw a party.such a singleminded emphasis, not to mention his employment of AIDS (from which two characters suffer directly, the others indirectly) as a metaphor for the universal dread of mortality that hovers over all of Woolf's characters, a death sentence of which her major characters are acutely conscious.<br /><br />Cunningham's conclusion works passibly well--Clarissa generously invites to the party intended for Richard, Richard's mom, with whom she has established an at least temporary bond.

B000MQC9H4|3.0|Once again I seem to tbe in the minority, because while this was a fun film, it was hardly \\"the best film ever\\".  The Jude Law character was one of the more believable characters I have seen in a long time. The film is long on Law and Diaz and short on Black and Winslet.  Also the last several films I have seen with Eli Wallach he plays a jew, when the character could have been anyone, but he makes these characters jewish -- that really isn't necessary and he seems to be turning into a professional jew..  The conversations -- especially at the beginning-- between Diaz and Law is some of the best written dialog I have heard in a long time.  The film rocks along switching between LA and England and comes to a happy if implausible end.  How these characters are going to resolve their geographical problems is left hanging in all of the happiness.<br /><br />This film is essentially sex driven and deals entirely with adult love issues, so it really isn't a family film.  The best part is there are no car chases, no explosions, no significant profanity, and there is even some character development with a (thin) plot -- all unusual characteristics in current films.  A fun film and worth renting.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|A great DVD.  It will never be again that so many stars appear in one box set! It is truely a great insight into the world of MGM and the large part it plays in history. What more can i say, it's GREAT!
B000JJSRNY|5.0|This is an item of obligatory purchase for anyone that want have the best live concerts ever.High quality in voices,repertory and register.It is a continuous pleasure that makes the DVD short.Do not hesitate to get it,compensates largely the price.Netrebko is inmense
B000PY52EU|4.0|Definitely quirky, sensual, resplendently religious and quite humorous.  This makes for an interesting movie, to say the least, but very well done.  The focus of the movie centers around the relationship between Christina Ricci and Samuel Jackson in some great dialogue.  No cliche's here.  They both deliver a great performance.  Justin Timberlake didn't do too bad as the anxiety-ridden soldier boy.      Nice to see Kim Richards back in game.  It's been a long time since \\"Escape to Witch Mountain.\\"
B0000029DD|4.0|Jeff Buckley was a musical firebomb.  He had a slow burn and a long comet like wake throughout his career.  He had a nearly 'perfect' range as shown on Crusade era carols and mixed jams like 'Mojo Pin' and 'So Real'.  To hear him whisper, 'I'm afraid....I'm afraid to love you,' is to hear beautiful resonate through sound- it was emotive, raw, shimmery, and sensual.  The CD is the only full effort produced by Buckley encompassing the title of: complete album.  Every other compilation was either unfinished (My Sweetheart the Drunk, revised and fretted over and then Buckley drowned) or it was a piecemeal of other recordings either caught live or pored over in remnants.  However, one thing remains standard:  Jeff Buckley was a tremendous vocalist with a gift for the dramatic, the flair of artistry, and although he drowned (following a familial confession of depression) his music rises from the fathoms as a beacon for real talent.  If only he hadn't gone so soon.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I was very excited to see this work after reading about the amount of effort put to realize it. After seeing it I can say I was not disappointed at all. I really enjoyed every minute seeing it. It is a unique experience to explore God's great creation where in normal man's life we will never have the chance to see most of it.<br /><br />It is definitely worth to own it; I indeed wish to see on Amazon similar documentaries especially in high definition format.
1582701709|5.0|The best book on self help that I have ever read. If everyone would just stop and think about what they are thinking about for just one minute, the world would be a better place. Shifting those bad thoughts to good thoughts can only do good. Love it.
0312360266|5.0|An excellent start to what promises to be a intriguing series, Marked resonates with both young adult and adult readers. An intriguing blend of \\"Harry Potter\\" meets \\"Dark Shadows\\", I found myself caught up with Zoey's new life, the politics within the House of Night and the machinations of Aphrodite and her crew. I devoured the book in nearly one sitting (I did have to get some sleep that night) and eagerly look forward to the next in the series.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|After seeing these shows on tv i decided to buy thinking this would be a great add to my HD DVD collection, but not knowing how amazing HD Planet Earth could be, simply breathtaking. To give you an idea ive never written a single review on amazon but after watching these i must add my pleaser with this hd dvd, if you buy you will not be disappoint for one second, unless you hate nature, then you might. But i must warn, you will want to pet the polar bears, dont they are live bear and will eat you!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Linkin Park by releasing this album is separating the true fans, from the sell out fans. The ones who have been with the band since middle school, and are now growing up with the band.. as the group moves from talking about things that every middle-school could relate to in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, to real life, and the things that it brings. Stop bashing the CD, all you sellouts for one genre of music.
B0000214F0|4.0|Interesting movie, well acted. It has some almost Fellini-like grotesque moments, but I really like this film. It is a record of the 70's when it was made. I do not think that you could make such a movie with fine actors, and all the sex today. This movie was from the more liberated sexual days of the 70's and is a marvelous document of such. Well worth seeing. And a telling of the history of Caligula and the social extravegances of the wealthy roman aristocracy.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This album is the coolest album I've ever heard.  The lyrics are so interesting and original.  The music is mysterious and creepy, yet so energetic.  Each song is so different from the next.  The album is a total blast to listen to.  I have to dance everytime I hear it.  I listen to it everyday and it always leaves me wanting more.  The Black Parade is destined to be a classic.  I also recommend the following product links.  They include awesome singles not heard on The Black Parade. [[ASIN:B000IY011G Welcome to the Black Parade (CD2)]] and [[ASIN:B000M7XRLK Famous Last Words]]
B000OCXMAE|3.0|the linkin park crew were pretty vocal that this album was different from their previous stuff, and boy were they right.  This is much much softer, and lacks that linkin park sound.  Frankly, they sound like a boy band for the bulk of this cd.  Its annoying, because the songs arent that far off from being great, but they are all missing that extra oompf....that \\"shut up when im talking to you\\" moment, know what i mean? <br />if youre a die hard linkin parker, buy the album, but dont have high expectations.  if youre a passive fan of theirs, skip this album, it lacks what makes the band great.
B00005JPD0|4.0|This is a very good movie considering what has been pushed out of the studio's in the past years.  Has some very good action scenes and a plot that you want to follow.
B000LAZDQA|2.0|I love the idea of a film that depicts sexuality as it exists, rather than in the exploitative manner of pornagraphy which reflects only (mostly unrealizable) fantasy.  But this film takes that seemingly simple idea nowhere.  In the end, it is just a big bore.  The plot (if there is one) mostly centers around a woman's quest to have an orgasm, but one gets the feeling that it just so happened that that was the best footage that the director shot, so he used it the most in the final edit.  The film has a workshop production feel -- like the director just gave the actors some ideas of themes and then yelled \\"action\\", figuring he'd use whatever worked, rather than producing a coherently written film containing a beginning, middle and end.  Unfortunately, I think the director only gets one shot at this concept, so we'll not see if he could get it right the next time.
0060899190|5.0|Insightful and provocative, the Post Secret book exposes the dark hidden secrets of everyday people. Definately not for the most conservative this book would make a daring coffee table book for those who aren't afraid to see the truth.
B000002NG7|4.0|Faith No More's last studio recording has a lot going for it, and even a couple of weak tracks can't hinder the overall joy that is Faith No More.  This band is a true original. They seem to have no reference points- or maybe they have too many to count- but no one has ever quite sounded like Faith No More.  They blend a truly awesome array of textures, tones, and styles, and spent their entire career defying categorization.  Are they metal? Are they rap/rock? Trip-hop? Alternative? The answer, of course, is yes. <br />Bordin (drummer, founder) has an obvious love of dark, Sabbath-esque metal, and is a big part of FNM'S \\"heavy\\" sound.  But the true genius in this band has to be Mike Patton.  His vocals are genuinely odd.  He seems to be able to do just about anything he wants with his voice, from whispy to gutteral, maniacal to soulful. Patton  is the only singer who can pull off what he does, so much so that I often think of him as metal's Freddie Mercury. <br />Album of the Year isn't Faith No More's best work, but there are a handful of \\"best-of moments.\\"  Last Cup of Sorrow causes shivers, as do Naked In Front of the Computer, Mouth to Mouth, and She Loves Me Not.  And like all Faith No More's work, the songs that don't seem so strong at first listen, start to grow and grow on you, and eventually your raving mad about everything they've ever committed to tape. <br />Strongly recommend this album, even if it's an ambitious title. It almost lives up to it. <br /> <br />
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Listen to \\"Sleepwalker\\", \\"Play For Blood\\", \\"Never Walk Alone..A Call To Arms\\" and \\"Gears of War\\" and you know what I'm talking about!
B00000G3AZ|5.0|My favorite role for Gwyneth Paltrow.  It's the original storyline for \\"Clueless\\".  It's so cute and clever!  My favorite line is:<br /><br />Mr Knightly says \\"Why didn't you ask me to submit a riddle.\\" and Emma replies \\"Your entire personality is a riddle.  I thought you overqualified.\\"
B000OCXMAE|5.0|some of you people have been bashing this album because Linkin Park changed their sound.  everyone has to start to realize that rap rock/numetal is dead.  since linkin park stopped touring in 2005 can anyone name a rap rock band that has any kind of success? i think not.  all the rap rock bands that were once big in the early part of the century have now faded away minus Linkin Park because they are smart enough to change their sound.  This album is like no other..its really good.  hell its album of the year quality imo. some of you have said the softer side of LP isn't good...but in reality this is the first time they have gone soft..besides breaking the habit(which really isnt a ballad) linkin park has never had any ballads.  and they did pretty good, mainly to chester's voice.  yes joe hanh is \\"gone\\" in this album because there are no scracthes from him.  well that is true but joe did put a lot of other sounds to the album.  if you see linkin park live now in 2007, joe has a labtop on stage with him that helps him produce some of these sounds i believe. some hardcore lp fans wont like this album at first but just make yourself listen to it more...itll grow on you...it did on me and ive been listening to lp since the beginning.  bands do like to change their style every once in a while.  i think music fans need to start to realize that change is good.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I can completely relate with all the people who are angry and absolutely disappointed with this Album... I thought the exact same thing on the first listen. But then I went through the booklet and read the lyrics. These songs may not have the harder beats that are all over Hybrid Theory and Meteora, but the first two albums do not come anywhere near to this one when it comes to the lyrics. The band really dug deep for these lyrics, I think those of us who have stuck with LP since day one will see that and look past the soft beats and the rest of the angry people putting this cd down. I was honestly hoping for a cd with this type of a truthfulness to their lyrics, if they make a second installment to reanimation, I hope they dont change too many of the lyrics. This CD once again shows the genuis that linkin park has behind their music ability, and most importantly shows the diversity of the band, shows that they are comftarble writting and performing any kind of music, becuase this cd shows no hesitation on any of their songs, even with them being so different from what they are acustomed to do
B000002B30|1.0|\\"Nostalgia is death,\\" Bob Dylan said in an interview once to Robert Hilburn. You can see it in this collection. Springbean was a product of the late 1970s and ever since has just been repeating himself. As Phil Spector recently said about Springbean's career, he has \\"protected himself with three new songs and 25 old ones.\\" With minor variation to the quote, it could serve for this release. <br /> <br />It's a cynical compilation of the multi-millionaire working-man-poseur's most superficial songs, with a few previously-unavailable numbers thrown in to entice die-hards to spend their money. <br /> <br />The new \\"modern\\" mastering of it is wretched, from the engineering school of \\"Turn everything up in volume and boost that treble to 11.\\" <br /> <br />The best Springbean song that's missing here? \\"On the Dark Side,\\" which Stephen King recently put in his list of all-time best rock and roll songs. If that had been included, they could have eliminated half of the selections they did pick.

B000MV9026|1.0|My family and I thought this would be a cute movie,and from the previews it looked like it would be. But from the very beginning it had sexual undertones and clearly made fun of people of faith.The main character Mumbo seemed to be on a quest to \\"enlighten'the faithful and traditional penguins. I can also bring up how they portrayed the traditional penguins as ignorant, close minded and unforgiving. There is a not so subtle message that we as humans are responsible for the disasters throughout the world. In the movie humans are refered to as \\"The Annihilators.\\" I cannot believe it won an oscar. Must be the same people who gave Al Gore's movie an award. I would not recommend this movie for anybody. It was a horrible and disgusting display of political propeganda.

B00005JPAO|4.0|THE QUEEN is first and foremost about Queen Elizabeth II, but it is also about Elizabeth, the person beneath the crown. To show us that person, it focuses on her reaction to the death of Princess Diana in 1997, and the media circus that followed. It was also about the complex relations between the House of Windsor and 10 Downing Street and their roles in the circus, as ringmasters, barkers, clowns, tight rope walkers, marks, and shills.<br /><br />Though Lady Di looms large in this legend, she is seen only in documentary footage, in interviews, public appearances, and paparazzi shots. No actress even attempts to play her, but it speaks to the authenticity of Helen Mirren's Oscar winning performance that the real life footage blends in seamlessly when ever she is on screen. Mirren was totally believable as Her Royal Majesty. All the little details were correct, even down to how the Royal Corgis obeyed her. A pack of dogs comes tearing through the room, then, with a single command from Her Royal Majesty; they all turn on a dime simultaneously. She had that authority in her voice, that certainty that her orders would be carried out.<br /><br />The second most important character in this story was newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Michael Sheen played him quite well, capturing his vibration, aided by an uncanny physical resemblance. He might have overdone the bright eyes--like a portrait of a Prime Minister as painted by Keene--but the slight exaggeration didn't spoil the over all effect. Besides achieving peace in Ireland, his role in stage managing Princess Diana's funeral may have been his finest hour. His popularity certainly soared after he declared Diana \\"The People's Princess.\\"<br /><br />The film shows us the complex relationship between Blair and The Queen, and both their spouses have much smaller roles, but provide little flashes of insight into the characters of the two principles. James Cromwell gives a strong performance as Prince Phillip, and was totally believable as he climbed into the royal bedchamber, saying \\"move over, cabbage.\\" So much for royal protocol. Tony Blair's wife was skeptical of the whole concept of monarchy, so she was a good foil, kind of a devil's advocate, if you will, for Tony Blair to express his growing admiration for the Queen, and the institution of the monarchy.<br /><br />Alex Jennings played Prince Charles, and though he was not nearly ugly enough--not saddled with the features of a horse--nevertheless, gave a good performance, almost making you feel sympathy for him. Missing in Action were William and Harry, the heir and the spare. They are rarely seen, and then only glimpsed, but this was a very tasteful choice by director Stephen Frears, and script writer Peter Morgan. Just one of many choices that make for a wonderful, well rounded film experience.<br /><br />Finally, I must mention the magnificent stag, in a cameo performance, who may be only a symbol, but a potent one, and one who illuminates just how the Queen always tries to keep a stiff upper lip, no matter what emotions are storming below.nd was totally believable as he climbed into the royal bedchamber, saying \\"move over, cabbage.\\" So much for royal protocol.

I find it has messages that while not philosophical, are 'how to's\\" that can only enhance a relationship.

B000O178BY|5.0|Though very pleased with his come back 2 years ago, \\"With Teeth\\" was never an impressive album for me as all previous ones from Trent Reznor's NIN. But meanwhile the man had a dream or a vision or whatever and the result seems to be a highly creative puzzle, being \\"Year Zero\\" the first visible and promising piece. \\"Year Zero\\" looks like a best-off album, showing all the range of styles Reznor is capable of performing and I find it impossible to highlight a couple of tracks once the entire album is absolutely amazing; Definitely my favourite album of the year so far.

B000F3TBIO|5.0|Unlike some other reviewers of this album, I am not a lifelong Mike Patton fan.  While admittedly this gives me less of time-tested Patton background, I do believe it gives me a more neutral outlook. <br /> <br />That being said, if listeners listen to this album with its concept in mind, one can't help but notice its genius.  It is a sort of satire of AND reaction to AND adaptation of pop music, carried out in a way that contains plenty of musical depth.   <br /> <br />It is inappropriate to compare it to works of Mr. Bungle or Faith No More because if you'll notice, neither one of those band names appears on the cover of this CD.   <br /> <br />The album tumultuously twists and dives through countless aural aesthetics, taking on a massively epic sound with the genius \\"Don't Even Trip\\" thanks to the inarguably brilliant mind of Amon Tobin.  Melodically, the song is one of the strongest I've ever heard from Patton.  It takes a look at pop sensibilities, and simultaneously embraces and mocks them. <br /> <br />I thoroughly recommend this album. <br /> <br />P.S. - hearing Norah Jones whisper bitter, evil-sounding lyrics is a sultry and sensuous experience that will knock many a person of their feet.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I've read some of the reviews.  And in the words of Chester Bennington: <br /> <br />\\"We're straying away from a lot of the predictable sounds we've had in the past, but there's no question in your mind when you hear it that it's Linkin Park...We've always said we write the music we write so that we can spread our wings as far as we want and try new things and go anywhere. I think we're really going to prove that with this new record\\" <br /> <br />In full honesty I was kinda scared to have pre-order the CD.  But I've realized that I needed to keep an open mind about this album.  Since I did see this quote on Wikipedia.  So, I'm excited for the band to move forward in their career.  To see what direction their going to move forward with their career.  <br /> <br />I do love the albums: Hybrid Theory EP, Hybrid Theory, and Meteroa.  One of their best albums is Hybrid Theory.  But this album is great for their career (for the good or the bad) since it shows that Linkin Park truly are musicians.  And they can stop out of the box of a certain genre.  It's like Green Day who changed on \\"American Idiot\\" (possible before with \\"Warning\\").  And people think it's not punk.  It's more punk not to follow a certain group or genre. <br /> <br />I honestly love the classic rock feel through out the album. It's horrible that today's music radio stations only play like 5 songs.  Then press repeat with an every once a while DJ.  I feel bad for today's younger generation who doesn't have a choice in what \\"music\\" they listen to on these pop stations.  I'm glad Linkin Park brought back some metal and classic rock feel in this.  Hopefully, people will start to listen to bands like: the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Meatloaf, Elvis Presley, the Clash, The Band, Talking Heads, The Ramones, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, and etc.....

B000NVIXFK|4.0|I have all of Rush's studio albums, but since \\"Test For Echo\\" the band has plainly struggled to find its footing among the ever-changing trends of the music business and public demand for rap, rap, hip-hop, rap. Along the way, other bands like Creed, System Of A Down, P.O.D., Korn, Linkin Park, Bloc Party, The Music, and others have taken up the Rush-like mantle and kept that Rush sound alive and well. They all pale in comparison, however.<br /><br />Yet, Rush hasn't really been Rush in a very long time. \\"Counterparts\\" seemed like the last truly diverse and interesting Rush album. \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" goes a long way to recoup what was lost on \\"Test For Echo\\" and \\"Vapor Trails\\". That's not to say that \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is a true return to form or and excellent album, but it does take a step in the right direction. The melodies and musicianship are improved, the production less 'dense' than the previous two albums. I could actually remember some of the melodies this time around on songs like \\"Far Cry\\", \\"The Larger Bowl\\", \\"The Main Monkey Business\\", \\"Faithless\\", \\"Bravest Face\\", \\"Good News First\\" and \\"We Hold On\\".<br /><br />There are three instrumentals here: the poorly titled \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" (which is my favorite of the three), Alex Lifeson's son's \\"Hope\\"  and \\"Malignant Narcissism\\". The rest of the ten tracks all have lyrics by Peart who seems to be in reflective mode this time around. His lyrics aren't quite as inspiring as in the middle phase of Rush, but they are more interesting than what he wrote on \\"Test For Echo\\" or \\"Vapor Trails\\".<br /><br />The band also uses no synths, as with \\"Vapor Trails\\", and Lifeson returns to using the acoustic guitar on many tracks, alongside his electric guitar playing. Peart appears to drum away with little gadgetry.<br /><br />All in all, this is the first Rush album in 14 years that I think I've really enjoyed, but it did take repeatedly listening to get into it. I suppose it's useless to recommend \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" since there seems to be a wide range of Rush fans, many who have already made up their minds about this new album. Listen to the samples, read the reviews, decide for yourself.ws\\" since there seems to be a wide range of Rush fans, many who have already made up their minds about this new album.

B000002U82|5.0|I know most all of you Pink Floyd fans are going to disagree with me, and nothing I say will ever change your mind about it, but it is now 2007 and this album just does not have any content that would qualify it as the best album ever recorded. Yes, back in early 1973 when this album was released it was groundbreaking and fantastic, which is exactly why it was number one for so long. It was definitely as they say, 'in the right place at the right time'. But it is now almost 35 years later, and while the album does stand the test of time, it is certainly not the best album ever recorded. Sure the album is ambient and brilliant, but you still must truthfully ask yourself two questions:<br />1) Lyrically is this the best album ever written?<br />I think not; and can you really disagree with me? You can't honestly believe that there's not been a single artist in 35 years that's penned a better album. Think about it, lyrically there is nothing that is absolutely extraordinary about this album. You must know that since 1973 there are many artists that have presented far better lyrical content in their recordings.<br />2) Musically is this the best album ever written?<br />Again the music is excellent, but it is in fact the mood and the sonic soundscape this album creates that has given it its timeless appeal. Well, I know that technicality was not the point of this album, but from the standpoint of technicality, and even musicianship, in 2007 this album contains nothing that has not been greatly surpassed. This is not arguable. Furthermore, since many contend that this is the best album ever recorded, this begs the logical question: are any of the members of Pink Floyd considered to be the best or one of the best in the world on their given instrument? The answer to that question is quite simply: no. I don't like to sound so critical because I too like Pink Floyd and this album, but all of this gushing praise and superlative language use does warrant that someone with conviction submit a differing perspective.<br />Now, I can certainly understand why many people say this is the best album ever recorded, in most cases this will be because you were there in the era when the album was released, it took you on a musical journey to a place you've never been before, and it holds a special place in your heart. But just ask anyone of a generation prior to yours what the best album ever recorded is and they will almost certainly give you answers you don't agree with, and nothing you say will ever change their minds about it, even though you know their answer is entirely generation related. However, with all of that being said, being born in the 60's I too was there in the era when this album was released, but I just cannot yield to popular opinion or agree with the unquestioning masses that this is the best album ever recorded, when it quite simply is not. This is my honest opinion, and whether you agree or do in fact disagree with me don't be a sheep let popular opinion tell you what you should and shouldn't listen to, or what the best album ever is.it a differing perspective.

B00000JSJC|3.0|This movie is unwatchable but if you're into hotty Brit actor Rafe then by all means have a look. First of all, mix yourself either a Mojito or a martini...or several. Trust me, you'll need it. The key is to put the \\"movie\\" on mute and have the remote at the ready for every time Juliet Whatsherface, Angela Bassett or Tom Sizemore is on-screen. Simply FF. There's no reason to put yourself through that kind of torture. There's also no reason to put yourself through the torture of the clunky and embarrassingly cheesy dialogue. Katherine Bigelow should be ashamed and publicly humilated. Jesus Christ.

B00000GAIW|4.0|Had this one on CD since 1993 (LOVED it) and finally bought the remastered one. The sound is cleaner, but - LOW on volume; somewhat disappointing. I turned the car volume to the maximum (never did that before - even half way would usually explode the speakers) and only got average volume. Songs are exellent though. If you do not have it yet - get it. If you do - wait for the 40th anniversary re-issue. Hopefully they will finally fix the sound. Seems like they trying to force us back to the turntables :)
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I have liked Linkin Park for quite some years now, and MTM is pretty good. Some songs are wonderful, I love listening to Shadow Of The Day and The Little Things Give You Away over and over again. I admit, they have gone a bit emo-esque, but that's fine with me. I could care less about the swearing either. However, there are some songs that make me cringe. No More Sorrow, for instance, is all about Bush. The lyrics exclaim \\"are you lost in your lies? do you tell yourself i don't realize your crusade's a disguise? replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives. i'm aware of what you've done,\\" which is clearly all political. Linkin Park never talked about politics before, and I never thought they would. I wished they never would. Hands Held High is pretty much the same as well, except with a bunch of annoying, cheesy Amens. The other songs are all great, however, so if you can look past those 2, it's worth your money. I give it 4.5/5 overall.

B000QUCNOK|5.0|How exactly do you make a movie about smells? After all, a movie is all about sight and sound. Touch, taste and smell rarely come into it.<br /><br />But acclaimed German director Tom Tykwer manages to make us smell things, in his most disturbing movie to date, \\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer.\\" This time around, the talented Tykwer abandons his usual lovers-against-the-world stories for a lushly-filmed, darkly comic story of olfactory obsession. Yes, that is what I said.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste Grenouillle (Ben Whishaw) is a man with a brilliant sense of smell, and zero body odor. He was born in a putrid fishmarket, raised in an orphanage, and later escapes from a tannery where he was working. He's enraptured by the many thrilling smells in the city -- he even kills a young girl, so that he can smell her lovely scent.<br /><br />In his search for the perfect scent, Jean-Baptiste gets a job with a once-famed perfume-maker (Dustin Hoffman). But after learning that not everything has a scent, he begins killing women to try to distill their scents into the ultimate perfume -- with beautiful redhead Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) as the \\"thirteenth scent.\\" But his ultimate scent has an even more sinister side, as his scents begin to affect the population in unusual ways.<br /><br />\\"Perfume\\" is Tykwer's most unique movie to date, and the one that definitely identifies him as a cinematic master. There are lots of music that are evocative, sensual, colourfully beautiful, or unspeakably creepy, but not many manage to be all of them. \\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\\" is all of those, and more.<br /><br />Obviously a movie doesn't smell like anything, except maybe stale popcorn. So Tykwer uses sight for smell -- rotted fish, maggots, moldy walls from the late 1700s to show Jean-Baptiste's miserable origins. And he uses sparkling colour and windblown trees for nicer scents. Colour takes the place of scent itself -- bright red Lola hair on multiple girls, flowers that seem to pop out of the screen, fresh leaves, brilliant fruits, even brightly coloured food. It gives the visuals a fairy-tale vibrancy.<br /><br />In fact, the scripting almost comes second to the exquisite cinematography. Yet Tykwer is able to bring across the powerful symbolism that brings the movie to life -- the smells are symbolic of love itself, which the scentless and amoral Jean-Baptiste does not have. He can only try to take it from others, with a finale that is the very image of poetic justice.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste himself is one of those love/hate characters, and Whishaw does an excellent job with his sort of half-crazy, intent stare. And there are some great supporting performances by Alan Rickman as Antoine Richis (Laura's dad) and Hoffman as the eccentric old perfume-maker -- he adds a welcome note of comedy.<br /><br />A movie is dependent on sight, but Tom Tykwer creates a movie that you can almost smell. \\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\\" is darkly comic, bizarrely beautiful movie, and definitely worth seeing.hat seem to pop out of the screen, fresh leaves, brilliant fruits, even brightly coloured food.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|First off, I don't like Linkin Park, but I've listened to the band's previous two albums enough years ago to get an idea of how the band used to be. \\"Hybrid Theory\\" was a CD that was my favorite years ago, but I've grown tired of it quickly. \\"Meteora\\" is cut-and-paste material. After a four year wait, LP fans experience the dramatic change that they have latched themselves to. They thought that \\"nu-metal isn't cool anymore, let's go for the cookie cutter indie sound that the kids adore nowadays\\", and that is a representation of Minutes to Midnight. I remembering listening to \\"What I've Done\\", and I think to myself, \\"Is THAT Linkin Park?\\" Sad but true, Linkin Park have sunken down into a deeper hole. They keep making music, yet they fail to realize that they have not been cared for since 2003. And now they release a forgettable load of trash.<br /><br />Avoid this at all cost and buy real music.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was long, it was slow, but it was very interesting.  I had previously read in historical biographies about the men who formed the CIA after WWII, and this film seemed to follow the information that I have learned.  I was quite surprised, however, by the films direction.  I always find it odd that spies for western nations could end up being spies for the Soviets.  Never ceases to amaze me.  Anyway, this film left me only slightly disappointed and mostly happy with what I saw.  Angelina Jolie could have stayed home, as while her role was important, it could have been played by anybody.  Her performance was rather flat.  Matt Damon was his typical Matt Damon self, that is right on target.  He is a blossoming and amazing actor, and I'm sure that we will continue to see stellar stuff from Matt.  Robert De Niro, who directs this film, made a couple of cameo appearances; it's always good to see De Niro.  Joe Pesci graced the screen for a few minutes, and I found it chilling how he was so much like himself.  I have to say that Joe Pesci is one of the most consistent character actors around, he is always Joe Pesci.  He'd make a great serial killer in the next Hannibal movie.  I was quite surprised by Billy Crudup's role; hard to imagine him with shortish hair.  <br /> <br />Good film, great writing.  It has a Godfather like touch to it.  In fact, it has that Sopranos, Godfather, Deadwood kind of ending where all of the bad guys get tied up in a nice bow and ribbon.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Thought the movie added brilliantly historical documentary with the movie proper.  Helen Mirren portrayed the Queen very well and the rest of the cast was excellent also.  Can see why Mirren won the Academy Award for her protrayal.
B000H5V8DG|3.0|Ok the box is great, beautiful, etc.... BUT ALL the dvds were scratched when they arrived, due to the bad packaging of the box. The discs are in cardboard sleeves which scratch the discs. I had to make paper sleeves for all of the dvds.... But fortunately, I can read them all, which is a good thing since I bought the box from France and I didn't know how to return it. <br />And one more bad surprise... I had to pay 30 more euros because of the customs.... So if you buy this box from France as I did, prepare yourselves for a little more expensive set... <br /> <br />Apart from that, the box is really really great and the show fantastic! Enjoy!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I watched both versions.. the one narrated by Weaver.. and the one by David Attenborough. Even though some people don't like Attenborough's british accent, but Weaver's voice doesn't carry any depth and it is so boring like she is reading it out of some book. The depth, feelings and heavy impact that Attenborough's voice carry.. is incomparable.
B0000000LI|5.0|Great CD I have been enjoying listening for about a year.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Of the 200 dvd's i own, this is one of my top 5. The movie is brutally, truthfully shown in a fictionous story. If you ask anyone who has seen this movie what they felt like after, they will all say the same thing. It leaves you feeling sick and sad and it makes it all the worth talking about. Clint Mansell also does a outstanding job with his music. The soundtrack is amazing. <br /> <br />I've never seen any movie that left me scared of what I could put my body/life through. It opens up your eyes, and will leave you stunned with the ending.
B00004SZBU|2.0|There are two versions Epic released of this SACD, a 2 channel stereo and a 5.1 hybrid with both the 2 channel and 5.1 surround versions on it. I will be reviewing the 5.1 version. Well, I'm a fan of SACD but there are some extenuating circumstances here. The main outstanding one is that some of the masters were destroyed in a fire. The songs sound ok but not mind blowing like Dark Side OF The Moon SACD or Goodbye Yellow Brick Road which were carefully engineered from original sources without any sound or financial limitations and it shows. This unfortunately sounds like an afterthought put together as best as can to put out what was then a new format to make an extra buck. A man named Frank Filipetti oversaw the 5.1 mix and he seems to have done a hell of a job considering the lost masters and I'm sure he didn't nearly have the budget or the time (or even the tapes!)alloted to some of the great SACD releases. Some of the songs sound great. I like the background vocals coming out the rear speakers. There is a weird effect of the vocals slap backing off the rear speakers however. A bit strange for me. You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth and Bat Out Of Hell sound really good. Here's the really really big problem and it's a doozy. The showcase song Paradise By The Dashboard Light. I believe the great Ellen Foley's vocals were lost in that fire. The whole sexy panting part during the Phil Rizutto middle sequence is very much missing and when she finally kicks in, after careful comparison..I don't think it's even her!! Either it's a different vocal take, which I don't think it is, or it's the  great live performer Carla DeVito filling in (Admirably but not quite the same). Maybe they brought Ellen back in 20 years later to redo the part? I read that some of the lost parts were re recorded so who knows? I am a giant Ellen Foley fan and the part is simply different. Judge for yourself if you can. The whole point of SACD in my opinion is to sonically bring a recordingto another level. This does not capture the magic of the original recording. The 5.1 SACD is hard to find. It's way overpriced. Avoid it.
078401213X|5.0|I can tell just from this movie having a $60,000 budget and as well as it does selling and viewing, Aronofsky's fans love movies that challenge the brain/mind, and he pulls it off so well in Pi. Some people complain about the black and white filming but it makes it much more interesting. You will not be disappointed with this and i also recommend(if you havent seen Requiem for a Dream) that you just buy the double set.
B000NA77YO|4.0|Like one or two other reviewers I just saw Sabbath along with Megadeath (in Columbia MD) in 2007 and was thrilled and amazed. Dio's voice holds up very well live and theses songs stand out without any need to refer to Sabbath when Ozzy was there. So I ran out and bought the CD. All the songs from Heaven and Hell are terrific. Iommi and Butler perform the way that artists can only after they have spent a lifetime feeding off of each other. While my personal favorites all came from H&H., there are no weak links in the recording. <br /> <br />If you are like me, and think there is no way fast/speed heavy metal can appeal to your over-40 years of age years, give this collection a listen. The lyrics are sophisticated, but not overbearing. The tunes are hammer-hard, but you might just find yourself whistling them later on.
1582701709|4.0|Well, I've been doing spiritual practice with Hermetic Kabbalah for about two years now.  To have this book come along and try to tell us all that a magical lifestyle is easy is a bit of a kick in the head. But, hec, maybe it's true for a lot of folks, for those who are already further along down the path.  The author of 'The Secret' has a knack for selling spirituality.  Gotta give her credit for that much.  And she certainly turns you on to what is possible - at least for what is possible for you when you get the psycho-baggage sorted out.   <br /> <br />For those who are still trying to get to the point where this book is a reality, I recommend in-depth texts like 'Vajra World' and 'Kabbalah, Magic & the Great Work...'  Once the prelimary work of these kinds of books is carried out to completion, I imagine that the reality painted by 'The Secret' will transform from New Age dream world to, well, at least a probability.
B000002IAS|5.0|One of the best live albums, a perfect mix of artists and Music
B000L43AN4|3.0|A bit disappointing. As usual with Tom Waits, some of the tracks are great -- Lucinda and Goodnight Irene are standouts. But too many, while not bad, are kinda ho-hum. With editing, this would have made a better 2-disc set, or a really good single CD.
B00005JPCF|5.0|Absolutely a great movie not only for the young but also for the young at heart.
B000006IUQ|5.0|If you like adventure, the great outdoors and, or course, Anthony Hopkins, then you will love this movie. There are very few movies that I will watch more then once and this is one of those movies. It is a very good movie that I recommend highly.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is an awesome CD by David Gilmour!  I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since the early 1970s and I highly recommend this CD as it is a great effort and there are some great Pink Floyd style songs on this.  This is one of the few CDs in years that I have purchased where I like every song.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|You know what it is that made the music of the late 60's and even some parts of the 70's so great? it wasn't all about talent although that, of course, played a huge part. It was because music was so creative and bands/artists such as The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Bob Dylan weren't afraid to go out on limbs and take risks w/ their music. Would The Beatles and Pink Floyd have the same awesome/wow, incredible! factor today if they hadn't ventured from the style of their initial albums? The answer is no, their music wouldn't have been so fantastic if they hadn't taken so many risks and been so daring and creative. For example, the critics mostly hated \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band\\" by The Beatles when it first came out because it was too different from their previous albums. But now it's regarded by many music buffs as being one of the greatest albums of all time. So why is it that today when a band/artist does something new and different people are so quick to think that they're \\"selling out\\" or that their music is bad just because it's not like their previous efforts? I only hope that people will look back on this album and see how much more mature and beautiful it is than Linkin Park's two previous albums. It's an imperfect album but one that is fantastic nonetheless. Haunting, powerful, great melodies and thoughtful, reflective lyrics. I wish that more LP fans would just appreciate this album for what it is and not compare it so much to their other albums. Because I love it and hope that others will too. Or they can hate it; I'd just like to see more fans be more open-minded about it and not simply trash it 'cause it's new and different, that's all.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I saw this musical twice on Broadway and this movie does a great job of taking the musical to the big screen.  It was very well done and compares nicely to the Broadway show.  I highly recommend it.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, a sensitive and intelligent poetry major at Yale.  Upon his graduation, he is invited to be one of the first agents in the fledgling CIA.  At this time he has a tender romance with a young, hearing-impaired woman, but a moment's dalliance with a friend's sister (played by Angelina Jolie) results in her pregnancy and their marriage.  Edward leaves her to go overseas to England and thus begins a distant and emotionless marriage and fatherhood.  As the years go by, Edward becomes totally remote and secretive, stung by the cruelty and treachery that he has witnessed.  The role of Edward Wilson is a difficult one to play and Matt Damon does a credible job with it.  There are problems with the script which mar the film, and the constant flashbacks are distracting and confusing.  The premise of the film is a very interesting one, the birth and development of the CIA as seen through the life of one of its early agents, but the movie is cold and emotionless like the lead character, and is told in a monotone.  The length of the film only adds to the deadening effect.  The movie makes a noble effort to tell a story, but it falls short of its potential.

B00005JNS0|5.0|I've come to really like Pixar productions.  Good movies, good story lines and just enough underlying adult humor to keep the parents engaged.  This story is cute, one that I'm sure will be a hit with the little ones.  Great animation, big star voices and a good story line that offers some life lessons.  One to add to the library.
0552550299|5.0|I wish Mr Stroud and other writers had more books like this.  It's a fun read.  As a few other readers mentioned, it's not the often repeated Tolkien copied fantasy.  The footnotes can make you laugh as he explains things as if  they are truly for real and make perfect sense.  The character development is excellent and you'll quickly feel a keen liking for some and a distinct dislike for others drawing your interest into the book.  I rarely find myself wanting to stat up at night and read but this book did just that.  Enjoy!

0553804367|4.0|Hawking's landmark bestseller, [[ASIN:0553380168 A Brief History of Time]], was published in 1988, and an updated edition was released ten years later. It introduced readers around the world to the large-scale (and very small scale) questions that are central to astronomy, physics, and to our understanding of the universe at the most basic levels.<br /><br />This new book (co-writtin with Leonard Mlodinow; nerds out there will be interested to know that Mlodinow wrote for Star Trek: The Next Generation) serves two purposes. First, it presents much of the material from Hawking's original book into a more accessible format, with less emphasis on mathematics and fewer technical details.<br /><br />The second purpose is to update the reader on new discoveries made since the updated [[ASIN:0553380168 A Brief History of Time]] was published in the late 1990's, with string theory getting particular attention.<br /><br />Making a book on theoretical physics that can be considered a \\"light read\\" is a daunting task, but Hawking's voice comes through with a clear, conversational tone and an easy confidence that inspires the reader to wrap their mind around the paradoxes of quantum mechanics and general relativity.<br /><br />There are a few places where the book seems a bit too watered down. Discussions of FTL travel and time travel seem to be reluctantly thrown in because the authors knew there would be demand for these topics. Neither is addressed with much depth or enthusiasm.<br /><br />The historical aspects of the book, on the other hand, are exceptionally well written, including brief biographical appendices on the lives of Einstein, Newton, and Galileo. Science has a rich history, and the team of Hawking and Mlodinow do a nice job of telling the stories behind the discoveries and theories.<br /><br />The book is illustrated with computer-generated full-color graphics, which are a bit of a mixed bag. Some do a great job of illustrating a concept, while others seem to be thrown in just to break up the text.<br /><br />Interestingly, while Hawking and Mlodinow do not specifically set forth their own religious viewpoints in this book, the spend a good deal of time acknowledging the possibility of the existence of God, and discussing the interplay between theoretical physics and the concept of a creator.<br /><br />As a science teacher who is not specifically teaching physics (I teach chemistry), I found that A Briefer History of Time really raised my interest and enthusiasm while summarizing some concepts that I was out of practice with. I found myself discussing ideas from this book with my students the day after I started reading it.<br /><br />In general, this is a great starting point or refresher for anyone with an interest in physics. If you are already familiar with the subject matter, you may still enjoy the historical details and the narrative voice, although there is not a great deal of technical depth.others seem to be thrown in just to break up the text.  <br /> <br />Interestingly, while Hawking and Mlodinow do not specifically set forth their own religious viewpoints in this book, the spend a good deal of time acknowledging the possibility of the existence of God, and discussing the interplay between theoretical physics and the concept of a creator.  <br /> <br />As a science teacher who is not specifically teaching physics (I teach chemistry), I found that A Briefer History of Time really raised my interest and enthusiasm while summarizing some concepts that I was out of practice with.

1594200823|5.0|A well written journey into what goes into our food.  I'm a bit of a nutrition-oriented foodie, so this book was a must-read for me.  However, I would recommend it for anyone who's concerned about what they put into their mouth as well as how their food choices affect the world around them (especially environmentally).
B000MNP2K8|3.0|Disjointed stylised rubbish! Where has the tongue in cheek humour gone? Bond has always been a British secret agent who has had a hard side that has always only been hinted at, but this new Bond is hard with a sense of humour that is barely hinted at - the complete opposite of all the previous Bonds. Don't get me wrong, Daniel Craig is a very good James Bond, but he needs a decent screenplay to work with for goodness sakes! And where the hell is Q? Shoot the writers ('writers' plural because the film was obviously written by a committee), bring back Q (and the \\"minister\\")and give Craig a sense of humour and you'll have the perfect new Bond. Rent this movie by all means but don't waste your money buying it - you'll only watch it once (and wonder at what could have been). Three stars for the chase at the beginning.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|I had never heard Loreena before and was suprised.  I loved her voice and the music was an impossible combination of celtic and middle eastern.  It sounded like something that would have come out of the crusades. It was original and enchanting. I love to listen to it while I'm driving. Brava Loreena!
0805047905|5.0|This is the favorite book of both of my kids.  They are a little old for it now but when they were under 2 it was the best.  We have a few copies of it...  and will pass it down to the next generation.  LOVE it!
B00005JPD0|4.0|I'd read mixed reviews about this movie but two things compelled me to watch it:<br /><br />  1. I absolutely loved Man on Fire, starring Denzel, and the same director (Tony Scott) was handling this film.<br /><br />  2. The plot was intriguing and I was pretty sure the movie would take some risks. Plus, Denzel Washington is nearly always compelling, always watchable.<br /><br />  I wasn't disappointed. Yes, the plot has some holes (so I only gave this one 4 stars)but it is also a combination of suspense, science fiction thriller and even a love story.I found it fascinating.<br /><br />  Without giving too much away, I'll simply note that the plot revolves around a violent crime and a Federal agent (played superbly and with great understatement by Washington) who is brought in to help solve the crime.<br /><br />  That is when things take an interesting, time-bending twist, making for that extraordinary film that rises above the average ones. It doesn't hurt that the rest of the cast is good, from Val Kilmer to Jim Caviezel.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I've never read Austen's book. For that matter, I've never seen the 6-hour BBC miniseries production, so I can't presume to say whether this is a great or faithful adaptation, I can't talk about what was left out (obviously, a lot must have been) and what was changed.  <br /> <br />All I can do is talk about this as a film. And, in a word, it's great. The directing, specifically, stands out: usually adaptations of classic literature like this is shot in a flat, stuffy, unimaginative way, but Joe Wright really uses the camera to illustrate the power and emotions in the underlying material. It's never showy, but there's a mastery at work here than I haven't seen in a literary adaptation since Scorsese's \\"The Age of Innocence.\\" It's hard to believe it's his first feature. <br /> <br />The acting is superb, and don't get caught up (as some others have been) about the minor moments in which this film isn't literally faithful to the book. Wright and his collaborators were obviously primarily concerned with making the film work on its own, and it does, wonderfully.  <br /> <br />This film is simply a moving, beautiful story, compellingly told. I can not rate it highly enough.
1594481938|3.0|I have read several of Nick Hornby's books, and this was not my favorite.  I quite enjoyed High Fidelity (much better than the movie, I think) and How to Be Good, but I did not like A Long Way Down.<br /><br />It has an interesting story, but the characters just aren't as involving as in his other books.  I would suggest trying one of his other books first, and then maybe this on if you like his style.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is excellent- does not explain the story as well as the BBC version but some of the scenes have much more feeling than the longer version- I love and own them both. My favorite scene in this film is where Darcy proposes to Elizabeth- the first time- as they are pounded by rain. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett actually made me cry.
B000022TSW|5.0|To start this movie is the worste animated, rudest and full of swears. Yet I am not joking when I say this movie is truly a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />The plot is quite hilarious and well thought out. At every point in the film is a laugh or two. Playing the movie over again, you may laugh even at stuff you missed the first time. <br /> <br />This movie is terribly overlooked in an important department, music. This film has some of the best music composition Ive ever heard. The film can almost be called a musical.... hell it is a musical. Every song is truly catchy. La Resistence is my personal favorite song. <br /> <br />This movie is not only funny but very smart. It is a guilty treat that never gets old. Do not over look this movie because of profanity.

0060512806|4.0|First of all, this book could do with an editor - a good editor.  The author frequently indulges himself in flights of tangential fancy that, while sometimes interesting, distract from the main story.  It is, as the title suggests, a book about cryptanalysis dating back to its seminal days during WWII.  Our protagonists, Lawrence Waterhouse and his grandson Randy, 50 years later, are both involved in cryptography.  Lawrence, who during WWII originally plays the glockenspiel and is nearly killed during Pearl Harbor, is later fortuitously discovered to possess nearly unimaginable cryptanalysis skills.   <br /> <br />Lawrence travels all over the world as one of America's top cryptographers.  Serendipitously, his path crosses with his grandson's 50 years later.  Bobby Shaftoe, the gung-ho Marine, also crosses paths with Lawrence Waterhouse and HIS granddaughter plays an important role in  Lawrence Waterhouse's grandson's life.   <br /> <br />There are innumerable interesting characters including Enoch Root who is  a member of Detachment 2702 (a counter crypto group) and the Japanese industrialist Goto Dengo who, during WWII was responsible for designing an impenetrable mine in which to hide stolen treasures.  Both Enoch Root and Goto Dengo touch the lives of Lawrence Waterhouse and his grandson Randy. <br /> <br />The book is an intriguing and creative jaunt through WWII and the current  high tech industry.  But it is looong - excruciatingly so.  But it is a worthwhile read and if you are not interested in the author's frequent forays into the unknown simply skim through those sections.   <br /> <br />A very good book - I would recommend it with some slight reservations.
B000NDIAWO|5.0|Yes, I found this cd exceptionally enjoyable, but I guess watching the VIDEOLOGY had something to do with it too since I think Videos always add excitement to songs.  That said, this review is based apon the fact that i viewed the Videos to all the songs before buying the album.  For One, the introduction of SHAKIRA is brilliant, and i'm happy Beyonce didnt underuse her equally famous counter-part, it would have been such a waiste.  The song, \\"beautiful liar\\" isnt perfect and is somewhat \\"slow\\" in tempo but its rather enjoyable with replayability.  Irreplaceable is just a suprise hit on radio and to my ears.  Greenlight, well that song is just so fun and has this old AS DO much of the songs on the albums.  60's 70's influence is diffenitly present.  In my opinion, the addition of \\"Flaws and all\\" was uneccessary and i find it makes the album slow down.  Thankfully, \\"Get me Bodied\\" revamps the cd and is personally one of my favorites from this album especially the extended MIX (Naomi Cambell walk, do the Naomi Cambell Walk!) Just too hott! makes me wanna dance! <br /> <br />I do have one question, Why so many Beautiful liar remixes??? ITs just silly and uneccassary.  PLus one of the songs says remix, yet sounds alike to the other one? Anyways alot of people appreciate Beyonce cross-cultural attempt with Hispanics so I can only applaud that.

1582701709|1.0|Ok  first of all I was disapointed with this book.....its no secret!<br /><br />The contributors in this book also like someone else mentioned here....are to be taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Firt of all *Dr* yah I said DR...Joe Vitale, who spewed out another similar piece of junk called spiritual marketing. In this book he claimed he had a friend, a energy healer called John who could instantly cure people of cancer, all ills and blockages......guess what happend when thousands of people wanted to know how they could find this John? Yup Joe Honesty Vitale said he was retired and taking time out for himself...of Course!!!! So be skeptical of his input into this book the Secret.<br /><br />Second of all The actual author herself...having come from Australia I know for a fact she doesn't have a solid repuatation like she states, not at home in Australia anyway...all smoke and mirros people she has rehashed ideas from better books like Ask and it is given and Creative Visualization by Dennings & Phillips.<br /><br />Third Example....<br /><br />Dr. *cough* John DeMartini *Sp?*.....ok this guy again like Dr Joe take with a grain of poison salt......I couldn't really call this guy a doctor not even in the monopoly sense...he was married to Athena Starwoman , like another reader here wrote *Australia's answer to miss cleo* Yup totally true!!!!!!!!! also from Australia they ran this shanky 1900 psychic call biz and it basically was a rip. She also would sell magic blue paper stars in a magazine called New Idea/Womans Day claiming that they granted wishes and that one man even had money fall from the ski!!!!!!! I'm not joking.<br /><br />Taking all this into account.......I couldn't take this book or dvd seriously, I wanted to which is why I purchased it....and then when I seen those names inside......I gagged.

B000IU3XTW|1.0|So many awesome songs and they make them sound terrible.  Do you love Everlong?  I do, but this is the worst version ever.  THIS ALBUM IS A DISASTER.
B000002J09|5.0|Simple despite the songs being overplayed it might be the greatest album along with Born to Run of all time.  And funny the song I listen to the least is Stairway to Heaven. (I do like the live version on the Song Remains the Same.)
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I was going to write about the changes in this album compared to there last album and just an honest view of the new album, but after reading some of the reviews about the album I just don't get fans. <br /> <br />Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and thats fine but most of the reviews talk about how they love Linkin Park on there first two albums but now they are basically disgusted by the new album.  In my opinion the new album is a great album.  No, I agree it is not the linkin park of old, its a new sound, can you tell its still linking park, yes. The problem with us as fans now a days is that we all want to keep hearing the same thing and that's why music is in a slump now a days because artist are trying to make these albums using the same formulas and they just suck. If this album was put out by a band with a different name other than linkin park it would get great reviews but because people want to hear the same music over and over again they have a problem with it.   <br /> <br />I listen to all music, I'm just looking for good music.  I am disappointed this album doesn't have the familar sound but Im excited about something new.  I think the cd is worth buying if you are a fan of music, if you are looking for the Rock/Rap Linkin Park, if you are looking for the first two albums over again my advice is to not buy this cd and put in the first two cd's and enjoy them. <br /> <br />The point is Linkin Park makes great music and the new album is different but still solid.
B000002J1C|5.0|of the albumns of Yes I like this one by far the most. It has the most interesting mix of instruments and voice.  Jon's voice, not to be mistaken by a lay person's hearing, or one of us younger\\" crowd as a \\"girl's voice\\" is still tenor, not alto.  The deep sounds from in his lungs give the quality unlike anything you would hear from a man (or a woman).  Jon's talent falters in later albums but here it is as fantastic as the rest of the musicians.  The most interesting thing about Yes and groups of this nature(Rush, Blue Oyster ect.) to me is the music, not the lyrics or the singing.  Steve Howe's rythmic, yet medolic Les Paul(I think) played as rythm and lead in \\"yours is no Disgrae\\" is quite distintive layered on to Chris's bass with it's odd altaring of pitch,  -Chris- is so good at doing.  The harsh rythm of Steve Howe's rytym section of it has a melody of it's own and is layered with a cleaner sounding classical gitar on lead(in the studio of course-probably L.P. re-amped, not an aucuostic).  The music is very raw sounding especially Bill Bruford's quick preciese percussion.  He is a jazz drummer but it works quite well here.  Some would call this music incoherent trash, yet it is just the opposite, it is not at all \\"weird\\" it is refreshing from all the robotic, watered down, rank-and-file bands of today and the last maybe 25 or so years.  Of course don't forget Tony Kaye and his edgy and harsh almost mundane organ grinding in \\"All good People's\\" end and \\"Starship Trooper.\\"  An imaculate perfromance on an imaculate instrument now totally absent and abandoned from the Rock and Roll and the music seen. Soon to be abandoned from the very history of music it'self I hate to say.  \\"Hope Tony isn't reading.\\" Probably not.
B000MV9026|3.0|I thought it would be about a penguin who finally fit in, not about a penguin who saves the world (so to speak) from disaster. I adored the Adelie penguins (Robin Williams et al) and how the writers came up with heart songs on how penguins met their mates. But the movie had too many \\"lessons to learn\\" that after a while, I got tired of being fed morality. My daughter loved the music, though, and the soundtrack is awesome!
B000OCXFCO|4.0|With 'United Abominations' Dave Mustaine delivers another classic Megadeth album after the excellent album 'The System Has Failed' which sounded like a thrash album of old but yet also included some new elements which Mustaine has done with every Megadeth album since 'Rust in Peace.' This time Mustaine pretty much follows the same direction, but stays more to the thrash side of the coin which really takes you back to the early days of the band...especially with songs like \\"Sleepwalker,\\" \\"Washington is Next,\\" \\"Never Walk Alone..,\\" \\"Gears of War,\\" & even the cool, inspirational song to us Americans \\"Amerikhastan.\\" Now for those hardcore critics, like I said there is still some sounds like the last album (melodic stuff) but it's still on the heavier side of things & Mustaine did a killer job making the CD heavy, yet still very upbeat! Definitely worth your money for some good ol' enjoyable metal!
B00005N91B|4.0|At the time this came out, I was only 11 years old so I really couldn't see it until acouple years later after sneaking it on when I was 13 years old.<br /><br />I was very stunned, mostly because I'd never seen a film that hot before (of course being 13 lol), even though I did (like this film) snuck on Total Recall a year eariler by the same director.<br /><br />I never understood why people were so mixed by the film, none of the scenes shown in the film,like the murder at the beginning and the numerous graphic sex scenes which didn't bother me like they did alot of other people.<br /><br />I believe like everyone else does that this was a part that Sharon Stone was born to play. She was perfectly cast in the role of Catherine Tramell (probably the screens best femme fatale ever) if they'd had got someone else for that role it wouldn't have been as effective as it was.<br /><br />It was kinda werid seeing Michael Douglas in the kind of role after growing up watching him in Romancing The Stone and The Jewel Of The Nile,but it was great and interesting to see different range he as an actor.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven is a director who loves to take chances and is not afriad to show the audiences certain scenes or subject matter which might disturb or flat out piss the viewers off. And that's why he's one of my favourite directors.<br /><br />Basic Instinct was (and still) is a great thiller to watch and a film which is still held by people (like me) as the sexiest film ever made.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Awesome, totally awesome! This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who loves to ROCK! enough said.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This is thier best album ever. Every song is awesome. 5 stars. Get this. Linkin park is the best.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|So, I have been reading the reviews for SBS, both here and online...what strikes me is that virtually every reviewer is prisming (yes, I verbed prism) their review based on the Wilco they liked, and the album that represented that sound. And I'm quite confident that age plays no small role in your embracement/acceptance/disdain/neglect (I don't think a non-fan would care enough to hate them) of the band. I've been a fan since A.M., and like it all. I enjoy the journey.  <br />     Is there any doubt that this album sounds like Wilco?  It's what they (Jeff) are (is) doing now.    Judge it like that, and I think you'll like it. Remember, these are the bands that we need to encourage to record and tour--  the fact that the album they'll be supporting stands on its own will make the tour that much more enjoyable. <br /> <br />I know that this review told you nothing about the sound of the album. If you've been a fan for Wilco for some years, don't let the negative reviews bring you down. It does rock; just in a different way than some of you may be accustomed.  You know this is Wilco.  For the YHF and AGIB fans, try it. If you don't dig it as a one-off, with them (him) experimenting with a 70s singer-songwriter sound, don't sweat it. The next album will be different.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Everyone knows this movie.  At least that is what I thought until I realized that my fourteen year old son had not seen it.  So, we watched it together and, of course, it has the same issues of conformity, rules following, boredom, freedom, life, learning, and stupid power trips for him as it does for everyone.  A terrific movie that you should watch with any of your teenagers who haven't seen it.<br /><br />What brought it up was the insurance commercial with the guy playing as the Risk that Never Sleeps and I pointed out to my son, \\"Hey, that's the guy from the parking garage in \\"Ferris Bueller\\".  \\"What?\\" he answered.  So, it was a must see.<br /><br />He loved the point about Cameron (indelibly played by Alan Ruck) being so tight that a lump of coal placed strategically in his anatomy could turn coal to diamond in a week.  Rooney being made the fool constantly is always enjoyable (perfectly played by Jeffrey Jones) and we enjoy seeing him get stuck in the mud, embarrassed, attacked by a dog, kicked in the face, and confronted with his wallet.  Edie McClurg as Grace is the PERFECT foil for Ed Rooney.  Who doesn't love her pulling pencil after pencil out of her teased up hair or the way she says \\"righteous dude\\".<br /><br />Of course, Ferris could be a monster if not played with just the right charm and lighthearted mischievousness that Matthew Broderick brings to the role.  If Ferris didn't actually care about other people and was only a sociopath it would be an awful story.  It really only works because Ferris is fooling parents who should have been paying closer attention, a sister who shouldn't be so uptight, a friend who is so miserable at home that trashing a rare Ferrari is the lesser crime, a principal who is vicious as well as stupid, and a headwaiter who is arrogant without any warrant to be so.  If all of these were caring and supportive people and Ferris was using them this way, well, he would be the bad guy.<br /><br />In any case, the movie is full of classic scenes, such as Ben Stein's calling roll and his little lecture on economics, the growth of the Save Ferris movement, Jennifer Grey's perfect performance as the steamed and jealous sister, and the performances mentioned above.  Mia Sara's performance as Sloane Peterson provides the one grounded and sane character in the whole movie.<br /><br />The extras on the disk I viewed were great (I assume there are various editions).  I learned lots of things about the making of the movie.  One of the interesting bits is that Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward (the parents, Katie and Tom Bueller) became a couple because of these roles and are actually married.  Also, Ben Stein had a feature talking about life and how Ferris shows us about freedom and how Ferris Bueller changed his life.  One of the funny bits is when Ben explains how Richard Nixon is the reason he got the role in Ferris Bueller and is responsible for all the good things that have happened to him because of that role.  I always enjoy Ben Stein talking about anything.<br /><br />An excellent and fun movie that I think benefits everyone who sees it.in's calling roll and his little lecture on economics, the growth of the Save Ferris movement, Jennifer Grey's perfect performance as the steamed and jealous sister, and the performances mentioned above.

B000005ALN|5.0|This album is easily in my top 10 albums of all time. And considering that albums from Pantera, Metallica, Anthrax, and Megadeth are also there, that must mean something. My roots lay in heavy music, but you just have to give props where props are due. <br /> <br />I love this album so much because it's George Michael laying it all out there for everyone to see. His lyrics are honest and his vocals are mind-blowing.  <br /> <br />Every time I listen to \\"You Have Been Loved,\\" I have to fight back the tears. How heart-wrenching to listen about a Mother's son dying and her trying to figure out why it all happened. \\"For what's the use in pressing palms when children fade in Mother's arms.\\" - Amazing. A Mother is \\"Searching for her crime\\" to figure out why such a horrible thing has befallen her. George is distressed over the futility of trying to explain why bad things happen. Just amazing. <br /> <br />This album is a piece of art. I can't say enough good things about it. <br /> <br />~Slick <br />

B000KCHWCW|4.0|I have a few versions of this brilliant, seminal album and for some reason, the Rykodisc version still sounds the best.  This mini lp replica sleeve version though is a treat because it faithfully replicates the original lp packaging and includes all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  The cardboard that is used is rather thin though and I have seen better mlps packaging like the ones done for the Hall & Oates and Bob Dylan albums but I guess I've also seen worse too.<br /><br />The downside though is that there are no bonus tracks like on the Rykodisc version.  There's no \\"John, I'm Only Dancing\\" and \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" for example which is a real shame. Although extra tracks don't always add to the enjoyment of new re-releases, they did do so however where the Rykodisc version is concerned.<br /><br />Plus points: nice mlps packaging, average sound quality.<br /><br />Minus points: not as good sound quality and tracks wise when compared to the Rykodisc version.<br /><br />Unless you really need to get the mlps packaging, give this one a miss if you already have the Rykodisc version.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Very different movie, which is appreciated, not the same old stuff. Very entertaining. Will keep you guessing and eyes and ears focused on the screen.
B000KCHWCM|5.0|David Bowie has many many albums and has gone through as many character and musical style changes but if I had to choose 2 of his best, I'd pick this with \\"Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars\\" in first place.  While Ziggy is an all-time rock and roll classic, \\"Hunky Dory\\" isn't that far off either with some of Bowie's best ever tunes present on this disc.  Just like on Ziggy, you'd by hard pressed to find any fillers on this baby.  The greats are here like: \\"Changes\\", \\"Oh! You Pretty Things\\" and \\"Life on Mars\\" but tracks like \\"The Bewlay Brothers\\" and \\"Queen [...]\\" also deserve honorary mention.  This mini-lp replica sleeve very faithfully recreates the original lp design although it wasn't put together that well as the cardboard used is very thin and really not put together as well as other mlps designs I've seen.  The sound quality is acceptable although again not as good as other remastered discs that I've heard but this seems to be a problem with all the \\"remastered\\" albums in David Bowie's catalog these days which is truly unfortunate.  We also get all the lyrics in English and Japanese.  Surely this is the best version of the album that is out there right now and comes highly recommended.

B000IJ7IVC|5.0|Fans of John Coltrane at his most accessible are in for a treat here with this mini-lp replica sleeve version of one of jazz's seminal recordings.  The packaging replicates in great detail the original lp design while the cd has been remastered to near perfection making the sound quality just about as good as it can be.  We also get 8 bonus tracks consisting of alternate takes of the main 7 tracks.  Coltrane would go on from here to raise the level of his art on albums like \\"A Love Supreme\\" but perhaps with the exception of \\"My Favourite Things\\", this album represents Coltrane at his most accessible and is enjoyed equally by casual listeners as well as the most demanding jazz critic.  No jazz library is complete without a copy of this jazz classic.  Certainly this is the best version of this album that is currently out there.  Highly recommended.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|Happy Feet was a great movie to watch with my children (aged 5 and 8). In response to the people that thought the movie had too many sexual innuendos, how many kids got it? When they sang the song to the tune of Let's Talk About Sex, the only kid that will get that is one that heard the song before. Let's face it, if that is the fact, then you are a horrible person. I think movie makers that introduce little jabs for the adults (like in Shrek) makes the movie more of one a parent is willing to watch with the little ones. Let's face it, if more parents were willing to watch Teletubbies and Strawberry Shortcake then they might have never added adult humor. I for one love Strawberry Shortcake and all the Barbie movies, but alas, not everyone is a nerd like me.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|This movie is really funny and very sweet.  I am not sure why it did not do well at the box office.  Great music, funny writing, cute story.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This video series is amazing! I saw it on tv and knew that I had to have it.  I teach 5th grade, and it is a wonderful supplement to my teaching.  What a great way to show my students how all things rely on one another for survival.  It shows them that our Earth is alive and how important it is to care for the Earth so that the cycle of life will continue.
032147404X|5.0|I really got a lot out of this book.  It was clear, concise and great for digital photographers who know their camera and how to use the various settings.  The text is not overly technical, it was an easy, informative read!  I would highly recommend it!
1582701709|5.0|As one who has explored several personal growth avenues, I have to say The Secret is outstanding. At the very least it offers powerful positive thinking. And there is potential for so much more if one diligently practices the Law of Attraction. The spiritual aspect of this thinking is obvious. But for the skeptics, there is also a logical and scientific aspect: By focusing on a new reality and believing it is possiible, we see new opportunities as they arise and are willing to take more risks. I have purchased the book and CD and anxiously await the DVD. I highly recommend The Secret, it is life changing.
B00005LIN0|4.0|Having read some of the other reviews, it appears as though some don't realize that Porgy and Bess was (and is) an opera. Many who are only familiar with the 1959 Samuel Goldwyn musical with Sidney Poitier, Brock Peters, Dorothy Dandrige, and Sammy Davis Jr. appear to be disappointed with this production. I too was initially introduced to Porgy and Bess via the musical. And, as a child, enjoyed it! However, after having purchased a complete score recording back in the 1970's, I came to discover just how much I was missing! I also discovered that Ira Gershwin had the Samuel Goldwyn musical pulled in 1974 since it demeaned what he and his brother, George, had in mind. A number of years back (March 20, 1983 to be exact) I saw a production of Porgy and Bess in it's entirety (it did omit the \\"Buzzard song\\") at Radio City Music Hall from the front row and was overwhelmed. I saw it again a couple of years ago at, I believe, the Carpenter Center in Richmond Va. (not quite the production as the one in NYC but good none the less). This DVD is about as close as I'll get to seeing a fine production of that opera again! If you don't like George Gershwin music or Operas, don't buy it! If you want to experience what George and Ira Gershwin intended, this is as close to it as we'll get for a while.

B0000542D2|5.0|I can't believe that there are actually people who haven't seen this movie and would need to read a review. A Hard Day's Night has been a part of my consciousness since I was little, but considering the Beatles' fan base is so wide and varied by age, I guess there might be some young fans who have not seen it. Whether you've never seen it or you've seen it 20 times, this is essensial viewing for Beatle fans and also people who are studying the art of film. Many famous directors sight this film as the first one they ever studied and even say it made them want to be directors. I remember studying it in college film classes. It is noted for it's quick cut away camera work, and innovative lighting.  <br /> <br />   But of course I am a hard core Beatle fan so I bought this dvd because I just love it. It's their first film, and most people,( I think them included,) think it was their best. But I also like Help because it's in color and it's a beautiful film.  <br /> <br />     Made in 1964, it features the Beatles at the youngest that most American people remember them.(Paul and George were barely out of their teens at this point) It is still very funny but I think the Beatles were a lot funnier when they were just being themselves in a documentry (like The Maysles Brother's The First American Visit dvd), or in interviews. The diologue is sort of contrived and even though the  screen writer traveled with them for months in order to get their speech patterns, I don't really think he was paying that much attention. I don't think he really captured them all that well. Or maybe they were too nervous to be natural. John and Paul come across as nervous and unatural. But they are still wonderful, and the music is really wonderful. This dvd has been remastered and restored of course, so it looks and sounds great.  <br /> <br />     I remember when A Hard Day's Night was still being shown on tv, so I'm a veteran but you will want to own this and watch it many times. What Beatle fan should be without this?  <br /> <br />
B000O178BY|5.0|Cutting his teeth on politics and armageddon, the industrial hope of the US churns out another brilliant work of art. The songs create a certain atmosphere and prove that there is much more lurking beyong the realms of Trent's subconscious mind than one would think. So much of his previous work has seemed an effort to purge the internal and reconcile personal demons. This work seems to me much more visceral and spontaneous, yet mysteriously every bit as powerful as the inner stuff. As with Bowie and many others, one expected that once the drugs stopped, so would the creative sparks. Somehow both Reznor and Bowie have managed to preserve much of the darkness of their earlier forays into hedonism while evolving in their arts to move on to richer and more diverse territory. Though becoming more accessible in many ways, Trent's music continues to stimulate and affect the soul.<br /><br />There are powerful rockers on this disc; as well as hypnotic melodies that prove infectious. The sonic glories of this disc deftly coincide with the stringent political insights to provide the listener much fodder for the brain.<br /><br />Indulge in this one as you did the other, With Teeth!
B00005JPFH|5.0|Spidey 3 is excellent! The action, effects and screenplay. There were Mixed emotions, times to laugh, cry, OUCH! YES!!!!!!!!, NO!!!!!!!,.... <br />The reason some may not like this move is because of its Too Much...ness,such as plenty of bad guys, choppy story and a sort of \\"compressed\\" movie. In other words, the movie throws alot at you, but in my opinion, this movie takes the spiderman series to a whole new level. I am looking forward for 4 ! <br />.........I think spidey is cooler on his dark side.
B000NVIXDW|1.0|\\"Mr. Bubble\\" drains the soul from classics like \\"Me and Mrs. Jones.\\"  zzzzz
B000O75F7C|5.0|Having been a fan of this band for a few years now, it's interesting to witness how their work has evolved. Having heard, during a concert in the fall of '06, some of the material for \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\" prior to the actual recording, I expected that this would be a continuing journey of Steven Wilson's ideas and writing. Certainly not a re-hash of things done before. The theme of this album is apparently about the trials and lives of so many of the younger generation today. It's dark, very dark. Unfortunately, it would be difficult to argue with Mr. Wilson's point. He's telling us stuff we don't want to hear but probably need to. <br /> <br />The title song opens this album and is a good transition from their last album into the new material. A little thicker, more dense and heavier than what we've heard previously yet well crafted and played with precision. A terrific jammin' bridge. The second song \\"My Ashes\\" is possibly my favorite and harks back to the feel of some of their earlier work. A bit more space and atmosphere compared to most of the other songs on this album. Next is what I would call their mini-opus of the album, \\"Anesthetize\\". I think this demonstrates Porcupine Tree in the here and now. It's in three parts starting smooth and flowing and then in the second section you hear the band in a much heavier vein than in previous works showing a part of the angst of our youth today. Hang on, this is like 200mph in a Ferrari. The third section doesn't slam on the brakes. It just takes it's foot off the accelerator and let's things cool down on it's own. I hear faint similarities to Blackfield (another Wilson project) here. In all, 17 minutes of mighty fine work. It's interesting to note that this song was called \\"The Beast\\" on the band's fan sites prior to it's official title. The last three songs, \\"Sentimental\\", \\"Way Out Here\\" and \\"Sleep Together\\" are finely crafted, impeccably played prog, rock, whatever you want to call it. Not only well crafted anddone, but also intelligent. <br /> <br />As for those who feel the album is too short, I disagree. Being a huge LP fan I have thought that most CD's are too long. Just because you can get it on there doesn't mean you should put it on there. I love to finish an album just a tiny bit hungry. Beats being stuffed with something less than nourishing. <br /> <br />The musicians in this band are consistantly excellent. Much praise has been bestowed upon drummer Gavin Harrison and deservedly so. Even non-drummers become aware of this guy's prowess and in this genre he may be in the top one or two in the world. Steven Wilson was fortunate to get this guy after the exodus of Chris Maitland. That said, Richard Barbieri (keys and synths) and Colin Edwin (bass)are equally adept and their interaction within the context of the music strike me as near perfect. I was delighted to see John Wesley credited on this album. For the past few years he has been on tour for the live shows to cover guitar and vocals with Steven and a better choice could not have been made. <br /> <br />As to the sonics of this album I feel compelled to comment here since I am an audiophile with an investment in my stereo that would rival a fine Euoropean sedan and because Steven Wilson mixes and masters his own stuff. There is a lot going on here and there is a sense of thickness and weight when the band gets to goin' full steam. Yes, there is compression which tends to squash dynamics and the vocals are a tad bit recessed but the material and musicianship are so strong I really don't care. I have heard this album on more typical audio gear and it sounded just fine. Bet it would be ok in the car too. <br /> <br />For me, this may very well be my fave album of '07 but it's early yet. If you're into this type of music pick up a copy. Worse case, you got your money's worth and that's rare these days. Highly recommended.
B0002U0UKS|5.0|I really love this CD - mainly because I've seen the movie so many times that when I hear the music, the visuals pop straight back into my head. The music is beautiful, and although limited to a few themes is masterfully worked so that it never really gets boring. <br /> <br />Only down side is that this is a Japanese import and all the track titles are written in kanji. I have no idea what each track is called - but as I know the movie so well, this is not a real problem. However, others might find it so.
B000J103WA|5.0|Absolutely awesome! Cream are tighter now than in their prime and this dvd is testament to that. The picture quality is superb, far better than \\"Eagles farewell 1 Melbourne\\". Do yourself a favour and buy this immediately! <br />
B000MV9026|4.0|Ordered \\"Happy Feet\\" for two young grandsons.  They have not yet had a chance to watch it.  They are a bit too young right now.  DVD arrived quickly and in fine condition.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I started listening to this because I realized hey, they came out with a new album. WOW. <br /> <br />Okay we start off with Wake. I started listening to it like, is the song going to start... NOW? So I get into it. I'm like... Lost Prophets? I had to double check with Amazon (as I had downloaded it from i-tunes) to make sure it was even the same band. Yes it was them. I bet when they go on tour Joe Han's just going to have to sit there, doing nothing. LOL. It's all rock, none of that scratch edge that made them them. <br /> <br />As you progress through the album it gets worse. I almost wondered if it was a different band borrowing Mike Shinoda for vocals. Or one of those \\"tribute of LP\\" bands that's been cropping up lately. <br /> <br />Shadow of the Day sounds like someone sat there and said \\"Now guys, Good Charlotte has been doing very good. Okay? Lets emulate them to get those kids listening to us too!\\"  <br /> <br />What I've done. I'm like, Yes. Maybe. It started coming back, the hard core edge, the rap, the rock. Everything but the music sampling which was so them at the time. It still was like, Um, what do we do now? This really still reminded me of Lost Prophets the most. I was rather scared for a moment yet again. <br /> <br />They tried somewhere around the end of the album again. Really. Because it was like, ahh, their old stuff. Still missing that raw edge though. <br /> <br />I listened finally to hands held high. After the beginning intro. I started to cry. Or something like that. Because they scared me, the past 12 songs. What came through my speakers finally was Linkin Park. Though listening through it, it sill sounded like they were trying too hard. <br /> <br />
B000OCXMAE|2.0|i'm just gonna come out and say this cd sucks .. flat out this is a load of crap i dont see how rick rubin could have produced this cd that other guy was right were a 7 year old band whos only done 3 cds cause we try to fit in with every style of music that is sellingnow. these guys are tryin to just fit in with what others are doing oh!!!!!!! i can cuss now im cool oh yea heres a good one to lets be another band doi ng a anti bush song yea like we havent heard that before !! no other band has ever written a song about our president. gimme a break this cd sucks but if you must go waste 14 bucks .
B000O176Q6|5.0|The definitive copy of Enter the Dragon for any Bruce Lee fan.  The movie itself looks as good as it ever has.  The single disc also includes something like 3-4 hours of Bruce Lee documentary including home video footage of Bruce training, and footage from him at martial arts expositions.  The interviews are excellent throughout.  Finally the real big plus is that it includes a new release of all available unedited footage from Game of Death.  <br /> <br />It's basically Enter the Dragon, plus all the actual Bruce footage from Game of Death, and all the documentary you will ever want to watch.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Since I'm a HUGE Terminator freak (I've read ALL of the books I could get my hands on about the Terminator series),I also know the history of this movie and it's rather quite interesting: <br /> James Cameron actually made this movie after he had a nightmare about a killer robot from the future and from there, he created one of my favorite movies of all time; The Terminator (T2 was FAR superior but that's another story). <br /> Before they starting filming they actually wanted Arnold to be the good guy but once he read the script for Cyberdyne System's Model 101 (or better known as the Terminator) Mr. Cameron decided to put him as the killer robot.  <br /> James Cameron called his good friend Stan Winston to be apart of the film (Stan Winston is an AMAZING special effects artist; he also did work for another film starring Arnold; Predator), he drew up the skeleton for CSM-101. <br /> At the time Linda Hamilton was dating James Cameron; he put her in the main role of Sarah Connor and the rest is history. <br /> <br />The story goes like this; in August 21, 1997 Cyberdyne launched nuclear warheads at Russia, and after mankind was nearly wiped out thanks to the nuclear winter, there was another war; a war against the machines.  <br /> John Connor decided to launch a rebellion against the machines but the war must be fought in the past before John is born. <br /> Cyberdyne decided to send a machine back into the past to kill the mother of John Connor back in 1984, but along with the machine comes John's father Kyle Reese to help Sarah and to help train her into becoming the soldier of the future so she can train her son into the man that he is going to become.  <br /> <br />The movies are VERY INTERESTING to me and I'm not into sci-fi at all but I LOVE The Terminator series and everything that is associated with it, so if you haven't seen it yet (God knows where you have been if you haven't seen this movie yet) or just want to catch a really good flick this is the moviefor you.  <br /> <br />
0451191153|5.0|600 pages of set up, 127 pages of a point. Well worth the 600 pages of set up. The point is sure to stay with you long after you place the book down, and has a great possibility of changing the way you face the world.  <br /> <br />A man's ego is the fountainhead of proggress.

0393316041|4.0|This book was fun to read.  Dr. Feynman surely has a lot of worthwile stories to tell.  He is an interesting character and has a lot to offer to those outside of the realm of physics.
B000006NPY|5.0|When a originally purchased this album back in 1998, nobody really wanted the sound of it, they said that it was to sweet, well yes indeed, but it was the natural evolution of the sound of a band such as The Smashing Pumpkins.  The Adore takes you by different atmospheres, from the depressing to the melancholy and some upbeat parts. but by the end of the album you want some more, but that's it, and it's a good thing because if you're depressed the next thing that you may do it's get a knife and cut your veins. Well it's not that strong but still it's an excelent album and if you're reading this, well my most sincere opinion it's that you should get it.
0143039830|2.0|I read this book because I loved Paul Aster's Brooklyn Follies.  This compilation of 3 short stories may have well been written by a completely different author.  They are short detective stories that are slightly intertwined.  I did not enjoy this book and do not recommend it.
B000OCZ0ZO|5.0|BEST LINKIN PARK ALBUM TO DATE!  <br />It can't be compared to Hybrid Theory or Meteora, because it's NOT the \\"same ol LP!\\" I've been anticipating this album since I embraced Meteora as one of my all-time favorite albums. I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED. Does that look strange? It may, because \\"I'm disappointed\\" is alot of what you'll see in reviews all over the net. It seems like the most close-minded people SADLY are also the most vocal. Get the album and listen to it all the way through, MULTIPLE times. Then YOU decide. I suggest the CD/DVD combo. The \\"Making Of\\" documentary is awesome, and really takes you inside the band to show how they arrived at this point. Must see. <br /> <br />FIRST: Throw away everything you think you know about Linkin Park.  <br />SECOND: Put on some headphones <br />THIRD: Press play   <br /> <br />1: WAKE- This IMO captures the entire history of the \\"LP sound\\" that so many have come to know and love, to show basically that this is the last you'll hear of it because... <br /> <br />2:GIVEN UP: Once this track starts, you're introduced into a ear-catching raw sound. Jingling keys and claps, no synths and electronic tones. It has a punk type vibe to it. Chorus makes it an instant \\"single\\" candidate. I won't spoil the surprise in this track. But i'll put it this way: Chester's vocals are not of this Earth. (10/10) <br /> <br />3:LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST: I overlooked this track on my first listen. But once I gave this album a thorough listen, it latched onto me and is now one of my all time favorite LP songs. It is a infectious mid-tempo ballad with a great hip hop drum beat. Chester once again shines on vocals. Simply beautiful. Would make a GREAT single if LP/WB chooses to release any slower songs as singles.(10/10) <br /> <br />4:BLEED IT OUT: It just stands out so boldly. There's just so many different eclectic elements blended together that fuse seamlessly into one of the most grooving, catchy LP songs to date. It features Mike rapping for all those starving for more flows to feel. Chester nails the chorus and bridge. They demonstrated some maturity by not taking this song over the top, and found just the right spots to hit vocally. It's short so it can definitely give the repeat button some use on your stereo. It was performed as the second song on their SNL appearance so I'm betting it's the next single.(10/10) <br /> <br />5:SHADOW OF THE DAY: Initially was the weakest track on the album in IMO. However, over the course of two weeks it has grabbed me and is one of those songs you can close your eyes and drift away to. Not what you'd expect on an LP CD eh? Though it does confirm those U2 comparisons you're seeing in most reviews. But that doesn't make it bad right? U2 is one of the greatest bands of all time by most people's vote. (9.5/10) <br /> <br />6:WHAT I'VE DONE: First single. You've probably already heard it. The song that bridges the gap. Has the classic LP song structure, but a more stripped down classic rock sound to it. Some love it, some hate it. I loved it instantly. I'm glad they went back into the studio and cut this track for the album. The video does a great job of showing what this song is all about.(10/10) <br /> <br />7:HANDS HELD HIGH: If you like George W. Bush, press the skip button. If you despise him as much as most, then the lyrics will really hit home and are some of the best from Shinoda thus far. Features all SIX members on the chorus to create a choir like effect. Very different for LP musically. But the lyrics carry this song to great heights. (9.5/10) <br /> <br />8:NO MORE SORROW: LISTEN TO THIS SONG! I don't have the words to describe it! Even if you don't wanna listen to the political lyrics, the music just pumps you up! The chorus, SMASHING! The refrain at the end will have you trying your hardest to mimic Chester's fantastic vocals. \\"your time has come to be replaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaced!!!!!\\" I LOVE IT! (10/10) <br /> <br />9:VALENTINE'S DAY: I don't know what it is,but I like this song. ALOT. Most people criticize this song for being too \\"pop\\" or \\"emo\\" or whatever. IT IS A GREAT SONG. Period. Great intro, great vocals. Gets heavier as the song progresses. A rockin crescendo.(10/10) <br /> <br />10:IN BETWEEN: Mike gets his sang on! He doesn't try to do things he's not capable of with his voice, so it comes off very well. He has this track all to himself and he does a great job.(8.5/10) <br /> <br />11:IN PIECES: One of my absolute favorites on the album. I am typically not a fan of fast tempo, punky type songs, but LP puts their twist on it and makes it sound very good. Brad hit a nice lil catchy solo on the bridge! This song was stuck in my head after the first listen. Just flat out GREAT! :D (10/10) <br /> <br />12:THE LITTLE THINGS GIVE YOU AWAY: There was so much hype and discussion about this song that I gained some lofty expectations and ideas of what it could sound like.(Brad's first solo, best LP song ever, yada, yada, yada) So when I first heard it and it sounded nothing like what I expected, I was slightly disappointed. However, ONCE AGAIN after a few listens and once expectations and notions were set aside, it quickly grew on me and became one of my favorites on the album. Must hear, another indescribable masterpiece. Great closer to the album. Is indeed the best song LP has done, and a great way to drive home the point that this new sound has arrived and is here to stay.(10/10) <br /> <br />And that's all folks. LP sticks to the 12 track formula.(the foreword on Meteora doesn't count :D) I wanted more immediately. Luckily, Brad said that the finished tracks that didn't make the cut may be released in the future. Keep your eyes open. MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT has the songs to rock out to, the songs to drive to, and the songs to listen to at night on the way to bed. All in all a very versatile album. Most complex, diverse and satisfying Linkin Park album. 5 STARS!!! <br /> <br />What I'm not understanding is why everyone is so shocked that this doesn't sound like \\"Meteora Theory\\" or basically a third album in the same vein of the predictable sound of the nu-metal genre. Especially when LP has been telling the media all along that they were looking to expand their horizons and try new things. And if I hear one more person say \\"I miss Mike's rapping! This sucks!\\" I'm gonna scream! Can people's memory be THAT bad that they forget... Crawling!(Mike---BACKING VOCALS!!!) Numb!(Mike---BACKING VOCALS!!!) One Step Closer!(Mike---BACKING VOCALS!!!) Breaking The Habit!(Mike---BACKING VOCALS!!!) GET IT? They could only ride that formula of \\"Mike on verses, Chester on Chorus, Mike and Chester exchange on bridge\\" for so long... That ride has ended! Jeez! Get over it! QWERTY was an experiment to see what else could be done with their OLD SOUND. The answer? Not much. While it is a good song, it does sound a bit tired. People are so quick to always try and compare things that are nothing alike and put down one thing because the other is what they're used to! So accept it or don't buy the album, there's no use in trying to crucify LP or any band because they didn't make something exactly, specifically, especially for YOU! So if you don't like it, listen to it a few more times. If that doesn't change your outlook, Hybrid Theory is still on the shelves at your local music store. Real LP fans MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT in stores 5.15.07 in the U.S.A. GO PICK IT UP!!!!!!!!!! <br />
B00005O5CM|5.0|Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is a ditzy, yet intelligent sorority president and fashion major with the perfect, handsome, and smart boyfriend, Warner. When Warner dumps her because she isn't \\"the serious girlfriend he needs\\" to advance his career, her whole world comes crashing down around her. After weeks of friend's concern, manicures, and moping Elle realizes that the only way to get Warner back is to become a serious girlfriend, meaning starting a career in law at Harvard. Elle actually manages to get into Harvard, her specialty being the history of polka dots, with a high score on her LSATs, and with an original admissions video in which she showcases her talent for using legal jargon in everyday life and her ability to recall facts quickly, such as the previous day's soap operas. So Elle gathers her possesions, most of which are pink, prepares Bruiser, her miniture short haired chihuahua, and sets off for Harvard.<br /><br />This movie was not what I expected, but I loved it! It's a great chick flick to watch with a group of friends and has memorable characters. Elle teaches us that all we need is determination (and good fashion sense!) to achieve our dreams.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Linkin Park was one of my favourite bands because they had their own sound - I've never heard another band who could duplicate the easy mix of rap and rock; who could have thoroughly entertaining songs, perfect no matter what mood you're in - and could give you energy if you cranked it!  <br /> <br />Minutes to Midnight is a sad excuse for a Linkin Park CD.  They have lost their sound, and now sound like a million other bands out there... Think Tom Petty with some 50-Cent mixed in random places.  The rap doesn't sync with the music, and most of it made me want to scream - not with energetic joy as before, but in agony.   <br /> <br />I remain a Linkin Park fan; but a fan of the glory days when they were \\"angry\\" and entertaining.  I purchased the CD without hearing anything from it because I expected it to be new songs, same band; if you haven't bought it already, don't - wait to hear the songs on the radio, if they get there.
B00005O3VC|4.0|Just as funny as it was when I first saw it 20+ years ago. Bought to share with my kids - they love it! Another generation to quote the many memorable scenes. The 5.1 soundtrack is well done, the commentary is very entertaining and extra material will appeal to the fans.

B000FA57N0|5.0|Serenity, the movie version of the television show \\"Firefly,\\" which was canceled after just one briefly wonderful season, is scifi at its best.  Both the series and the movie are unsung heroes in that they are something new to the genre, with an experienced cast that demonstrated chemistry from day one of the series' launch in 2003.   <br /> <br />The movie is quite intelligent, with excellent depth for many of the characters, while still supplying the kind of action and excitement that keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the movie.  The villain in the story is fascinating as well, one who is both complementary to Mal and a counterpoint.  The villain, known as \\"The Operative, is a \\"believer,\\" who ardently seeks human perfection, which underscores how dramatically he misunderstands humanity. <br /> <br />The last minutes of the film have a powerful message both in terms of the story as well as for the world around us.  I won't spoil the movie for readers, but I will say that this movie will disturb you, enlighten you and, ultimately, inspire you. <br /> <br />This is one of the best scifi movies to hit the big screen in at least the last 10 years.  I highly recommend it.

B000002UAO|5.0|This is just one of those must-have albums.  Argueably the best Beatles album (and thus perhaps the best album of all time), you will not be disappointed with this one.  If you like the Beatles, then you already know that this is a \\"no-brainer\\".
B000NDIAWY|5.0|One of the few artists to come along in awhile who has really captured my attention with her wonderfully written songs and compelling, earthy voice. This is Brandi Carlile's second album and is just as wonderful as her first album.
B000000OQF|5.0|At the age of 60 I have discovered Guns N' Roses. I had to go and buy all the other CDs as well. It's never too late to find a really good Rock and Roll band.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|It's Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel meets X-Files meets Route 66. Sam and Dean Winchester are two brothers who were raised by their father to fight evil, banish ghosts, and hunt the demon that killed their mother. Developed by Eric Kripke and produced by the CW (formerly the WB & UPN networks), Supernatural has proven itself a show ideally suited for those fans who miss the horror/monster-fighting of BtVS/AtS as well as the strong caring relationship shared by the X-Files' two leads.<br /><br />The complete first season includes deleted scenes, commentary by both Jensen Ackles (Dean Winchester) and Jared Padalecki (Sam Winchester), outtakes, and all 22 episodes of a killer new show. I watched one episode online and was hooked; once I purchased the entire first season I became a devoted watcher. The strong, sometimes adverserial but always caring relationship between the two brothers makes for compelling tv. The monsters/case of the week are suitably horrifying or entertaining and always provide a new bit of information or insight into the show's overarching mythology. The appearance of Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Grey's Anatomy) as John Winchester, the boys' stern but loving father, is an added bonus. If you've been waiting for a decent show now that Joss Whedon's offerings are in syndication, give Supernatural a try. You won't be disappointed.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|If you like Guns N' Roses then this is an absolute must have video.
B000FILW86|5.0|Every time I get this out and play it, I can't believe how good it is.  I got in the mood for it again last week and it's basically all I've been listening to since.  Every song is good!  I'm not kidding.  And it's a great CD to exercise to, lots of fast songs.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I'm a big LP fan - and this new CD is a big hit with me.  It's different than the other 2 - but not in a negative way at all, at least to me.  It just shows that even in a new direction, they have amazing talent and I love that they weren't afraid to showcase that.  I think it would have been easy for them to do the same kind of CD again, and what sets LP apart is their abilty to take chances - it's a great journey that are taking us on - thanks LP for sharing it with your fans!  This CD rocks!
B000ENC6XM|4.0|If you're going to watch this movie, you've really got to watch it in HD! This \\"Constantine\\" HD DVD exhibits some of the most outstanding visual sequences you'll find in a demon movie, or otherwise - way cool stuff! The transfer is very clean and top-notch.<br /><br />The Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is a great feature to enhance this otherwise thematic audio track: the dialog is as if spoken in the public library, and all of the demon encounters are as if you're smack in the middle of the action. That's just the style though, but this \\"quiet dialog\\" style is the sort of thing which makes me want to get it over with or go to sleep - one of the two...overall the movie does sound great.<br /><br />The whole demon movie genre doesn't do much for me...never really did. The chanting, the touching, and the controversial symbols that bring out the people who like to make a big to-do about anything controversial - it's all too much for me. These are typical features which lend themselves to predictability, but if these elements aren't there, then it isn't a demon movie anymore - a catch 22. Does this mean that once you've seen this kind of movie you've seen 'em all? I think it does [for me].<br /><br />The good news here is that \\"Constantine\\" is very modern, it's extremely huge in production value, and it has some awesome visual appeal that's fresh enough to make this movie quite an entertaining film.<br /><br />There's tons of features form behind the story, to additional footage (deleted scenes), a music video, two feature commentaries by two groups of two of four different people, teaser and theatrical trailers, and an IME with Director Francis Lawrence.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Constantine\\" (mostly for the special effects).
0975991477|5.0|I can count, on one hand, those rare and phenomenal teachers in my life. <br />Bruce Lipton is on that hand now.  \\"The Biology of Belief\\" engages the reader in the same way that a crafty and creative professor does in a classroom of naive engenous.  By way of delightful and personal stories and anecdotes, (and thoroughly notated references), Dr. Lipton pulls us into the inner workings of the humble single cell.  By the time we have finished taking the journey with him,  we come to a greater understanding of the mass of cells we are actually managing as our body/our mind day to day.  (Or are they managing us?)  \\"The Biology of Belief\\" empowers us to this awareness, and to our response,... and much, much more.
0393327655|3.0|I agree with the basic premise that irrationality is the root of all evil. But this is nothing more than atheists, agnostics and scientists have been saying for years, and I don't see that Harris adds much in the way of original ideas.  <br /> <br />And when he does stick his neck out, Harris seems more opinionated than thoughtful. For example, he claims that the \\"collateral damage\\" deaths caused by America fighting terrorism are on a different moral level than the deaths caused by terrorist Muslims. Yet he doesn't address the obvious (and important!) further questions. How many \\"collateral deaths\\" are permissible to kill one terrorist? Can't the collateral damage allowance be abused, as when Iraq is invaded and many thousands of innocents killed based on little or no evidence that this will reduce terrorism? Couldn't non-Muslim terrorists like Tim McVeigh use the collateral damage argument? Perhaps if the Oklahoma bombing had disrupted the government enough, the government would not have \\"mistakenly\\" invaded Iraq! I am definitely not on McVeigh's side; the point is that these are important logical consequences of Harris's views which he should have addressed. <br /> <br />Indeed, given what Harris says about allowable collateral damage in fighting terrorism, along with the rest of his book, it seems to follow that atheists everywhere should immediately start shooting people of faith on sight. After all, Harris gives many examples of how religious extremists of all stripes are essentially actively trying to harm us rational people. And as for the more moderate faithfuls, well, they're just collateral damage in our fight against the extremely irrational. Harris thankfully doesn't go this far, but given the rest of his views, he should explain why not.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|If it was not for Will Smith running every 5 min I'm sure this film would go on for ever.  Nice true story but very poor screen play.  A one watch movie so rent it don't buy.
B000MKD9P6|4.0|I'm a big fan of Meryl Streep. She is among the best two or three actresses living today, and is always able to become her character. This movie was no different, as Ms. Streep plays the managing editor of a big New York fashion magazine. The \\"devil\\" in the title refers to her, as she is an exacting, overly critical, elitist personality who is the center of her universe, and who expects everybody to kowtow to her. She finally meets her match, when a young aspiring journalist takes a job as her second assistant. This is somewhat of a \\"chick flick\\", but both my wife and I enjoyed it. The supporting cast including Stanley Tucci were spot on, the story was interesting, and there was a good organic mix of humor and pathos. Worth a $3.99 download to my Tivo S3. Enjoy.
B00005JPD0|4.0|Great movie even my wife enjoyed this one and she hates sci-fi.  Great action keeps you griped to the end. I'll watch this again and again just like Enemy of the State.
B0007RT9LW|5.0|I saw the original\\"Gone\\" in the 70's & many times times more on cable & I  own the VHS & Plain DVD when DVD's came out. I have seen remakes of other movies and they did suck,but This didn't.     The plot was abit different that the original,but it had to change. Nicolas did a bang up job {No pun} & I liked the ending about family  & saving the cop.I loved the part of mentor played by Robert Duvall,just as crusty as the part he played from Days of Thunder.    But The best part was indeed played by Angelina Jolie.Great Call. Buying the Directors Cut as I type.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I respect them for moving on and trying something new. When I had first heard they were going to do that I was excited. I loved LP for thier heavy guitar rifts and they way they conveyed thier lyrics in a extreme manor. <br /> <br /> However this album is just not what I expected at all. It just didn't do it for me. It's way to slow. It's not that I don't like it, It's just not the same LP \\"AT ALL\\". They went from one end of the spectrum to the other in too drastic of a time period. They needed to cut a record that had both thier styles on it beforee this one so you kind of new where they were headed before this one came out. It's like they were hard one day and emo the next. Also, what's with the swearing? I swear tons so it's not that It burns my ears. It's my kids! I didn't mind them listening to LP at all. I didn't have to sensor thier music. I pretty disapointed as far as that goes. Anyway to sum it all up...\\"To much change, To drastically\\"!
B000286RKW|5.0|Martin Scorcese's epic tale of the rise and fall of small-time Mafioso Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his associates is riveting storytelling that is often as densely packed with information about the details and culture of mob life as a documentary.  As a boy, Hill aspires to the power and wealth of the wiseguys he sees around the neighborhood.  As he rises through the ranks, accumulating money, power, and a beautiful wife (Lorraine Bracco), Scorcese shows us how seductive this lifestyle can be.  Yet he never flinches from its basic brutality and the thuggish mindset that money cannot change.  In the end, the concept of honor among theives is shown to be a lie, a self-aggrandizing fiction that lasts only as long as it coincides with self-interest.  This is perhaps Scorcese's best film and benefits enormously from complex, important supporting performances from long-time Scorcese accomplices Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.
B000MDHJFE|1.0|This movie is a 2 hour and 40 minute snoozefest. After reading the other reviews here, the only conclusion that I can come to is they must have reduced the price of crack. <br /> <br />I literally kept falling asleep while watching this, and my wife kept waking me up. We wanted to shut it off but we'd invested so much time into it already, we felt that we had to sit through it to the end. <br /> <br />There is one of those rare films that has no redeeming qualities. No, there was one. I got to see Orson Bean, who used to be on To Tell the Truth, in a movie role.
B000001FN1|5.0|Bought this CD based on the All We Are video back in the late 80's. Doro is hot and has the best heavy metal female voice around. She puts Lita Ford to shame. Every song has a great riff to it. Love it and I'm trying to buy the earlier Warlock CDs to compliment this one. Gotta have more Doro.
0439813786|5.0|I love reading children's literature.  After watching Al Roker's book club on the Today Show, I had to run to the book store to look at this book.  I picked it up, sat in one of the cozy chairs, and started reading.  I couldn't put it down.  The characters came to life.  The illustrations  were captivating as they helped to tell the story.  It was a new experience in reading, reading through words, pictures, and illustrations.   <br />    I would recommend this book to children of all ages, six to ninety-six.  I would also recommend it as a read aloud for teachers of all grade levels. <br />    Don't let the 550 pages scare the little ones, I read this book in one day.  Anyone can do it.   <br />     <br />Brian Selznick has created a whole new style of writing.  I just loved it!
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I have ordered from many other sellers and have never been as satisfied with my order as I am with Amazon!!! They offer the most complete product. I will never order from any other seller again!!
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Like most people reading or writing these reviews, I've been a Linkin Park fan since their first album, Hybrid Theory.  I downloaded Minutes To Midnight cheap off the internet since I heard some of the bad reviews (not that I pay too much attention to those) and listened to some samples of the tracks and was not too impressed.  After listening to the album, only one conclusion can be drawn...either you'll like it or you'll hate it.<br /><br />It's understandable how some Linkin Park fans would be let down by LP's change in sound for this album, mellowing it out.  (If only they had did this for a few songs, not the entire album!)  I was expecting more myself, but to call people who dislike the album \\"untrue Linkin Park fans\\" isn't fair!  It's all a matter of opinion and personal taste.  (And as we all know, there's no accounting for that!)  Those with particular tastes, such as those that only like heavy, fast-paced music and can't stand softer, slow-paced alternative stuff won't like this album because that's basically what it is.  But for those of us who enjoy a broader range of music, from electronica to rock to alternative and so on (such as myself), will either like it or be a bit dissappointed with the change in sound, but still find certain sounds or tracks enjoyable.  You just have to be willing to give it a chance.<br /><br />That being said, it's only a good idea for a band to change their sound if their original sound was bad to begin with.  Linkin Park's sound was very good to begin with, so there isn't really a need to change it.  LP, change back to your older sound for your next album, please!  Your fan base would be much happier!
630471193X|4.0|George Malley (John Travolta) is an affable, easy-going auto mechanic in a sleepy American town.  He has become smitten by Lace (Kyra Sedgwick), a ferociously-independent and emotionally guarded single mother who manufacturers chairs in an even more remote location than the town itself.  George's bumbling attempts at piquing her interest continually fail, yet he remains optimistic, even after she rebuffs him for his 37th birthday party.<br /><br />Remonstrated by his long-time friend Nate (Forest Whitaker) that he shouldn't be purchasing his own drinks at his own birthday party, George wanders outside, where he has a most unusual encounter--perhaps even of the \\"first\\" and \\"close\\" variety.  Rendered senseless by the experience, he soon recovers and heads back inside the bar, where his pals continue their celebrations and chuckle as he tells his story.  Later that night, George lies awake, pressured thoughts consuming his mind.  Suddenly, he bolts out of his useless bed as a surprising illumination enters his brain:  he now knows exactly how the darned rabbit keeps getting in his fenced-off garden!<br /><br />There are so many undercurrent messages socked away in this movie, it is a wonder the director, Jon Turteltaub (\\"Instinct,\\" \\"National Treasure\\"), remembered to film the thing.  It is a testament to this director's subtlety that these messages come across as gentle and graceful reminders of life's beauty, rather than as annoying platitudes meant to placate the unwashed masses.  A few examples, and I have doubtless missed many:  \\"sometimes remarkable things happen to unremarkable people,\\" \\"every person's life belongs to a greater whole,\\" \\"judge not with haste,\\" \\"information is power,\\" \\"humans possess near-unlimited potential,\\" and \\"love can be everything.\\"  I tend to view the cramming of acceptable moral precepts down an audience's collective throat--during something meant as entertainment--to be a particularly sad method by which Hollywood demonstrates its humanity; however, this tactic is not being employed here.<br /><br />*minor spoilers/plot points below*<br /><br />We are witness to George coming to grips with his new-found powers.  His rise in the community from country gentleman to powerful entity is shown clearly through the eyes of the audience, who exhibit very believable reactions:  fear, humility, puzzlement, and, that most cursed of double-edged swords, worship.  He witnesses friends drifting away, metamorphing into disciples, or being shamed into silence because of their perceived intellectual inadequacy.  George becomes slave to these myriad new ideas filling his brain, preventing sleep, self-care, and respite.  He involves himself in a cipher \\"game\\" on the short-wave radio belonging to Nate, and ultimately provokes very highly-placed unwanted attention, indeed.  George wonders why all his newfound abilities help him not at all in his quest to pierce Lace's heart.  He invents many rude implements, which yet work spectacularly well in their functions.  A seismologist from Berkley, visiting Mr. Malley to verify his ability to \\"sense\\" ULF (ultra-low frequency) emissions--which herald the arrival of an earthquake--is swept along on a scavenger hunt of sorts for an extremely sick local boy.<br /><br />*end minor spoilers/plot points*<br /><br />There are far, far too many ideas explored in this movie, but it succeeds anyway.  Travolta is not fantastically convincing in the beginning; yet he, like George, becomes more and more remarkable (and thus, believable) as the movie progresses.  The gentle way he informs Lace that \\"it's happening,\\" made me want to switch the movie off, so real it seemed.  Kyra is absolutely convincing, as always.  I fell in love with her character at least five separate times in the movie.  Robert Duvall and Forest Whitaker also steal many scenes with their requisite skill.  Mr. Duvall's outburst in the pub towards movie's end stunned me into silence.  Forest's performance as socially-stuntedintrovert, incapable of expressing his feelings towards women, was totally on the money.  I'm sorry I waited nearly eleven years to see this movie.  It touched my mind and my heart by the end--just as Malley's experience touched his, and those of the people he loved.  This was a beautiful and worthwhile movie.  Sometimes \\"star-studded\\" yields something truly memorable:  here is that movie.ally-stunted introvert, incapable of expressing his feelings towards women, was totally on the money.

B000NA1OXY|2.0|Avril Lavigne came out of nowhere back in 2002 with \\"Complicated\\", a song that EVERYONE liked, whether you'll admit it or not. While her debut album Let Go might have catered to a younger crowd, it still produced plenty of hits and in turn sold several million copies. Then Avril perfected her craft with the more mature-sounding Under My Skin; then, she came back with \\"Keep Holding On\\", which probably made people think that her third album, The Best Damn Thing, would be picking up where Under My Skin left off. Sadly, that's not the case.<br /><br />As a number of reviewers have already mentioned, this album really sounds more like Let Go than anything else. Now, Let Go wasn't a bad album by any means (I gave it four stars), but, well, Avril still has that maturing voice as especially showcased on her second album, so she shouldn't be wasting it on tunes that sound like throwaways from her first album. This is especially shown on aptly titled tracks like \\"I Can Do Better\\" and \\"I Don't Have to Try\\". \\"Girlfriend\\" is infectious and all, but when I first heard it, I was like, \\"Didn't this song use to be called `Sk8er Boi'?\\" And the title track shares the same beat as \\"Girlfriend\\".<br /><br />This phenomenon also shows on \\"Everything Back But You\\". The album isn't ALL bad though, as Avril does do well on the ballads \\"Innocence\\" and the aforementioned \\"Keep Holding On\\" (but \\"When You're Gone\\" is really cheesy). Still, honing one's craft usually means that the artist goes FORWARD, not backward. Buy this only if you really want to complete your Avril Lavigne collection, because this album isn't the best damn thing at all.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000GG4Y32|4.0|As a disclaimer I must tell you that I am a big fan of the film epic, especially from the director, David Lean, who directed Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia. In Reds, there are long treks across the frozen tundra and men on horseback attacking trains that pay homage to Lean.<br /><br />There are spectacular scenes and attention to detail that make the film a visual treat. The cinematography earns the Oscar it got in 1982 and looks wonderful on DVD. It really doesn't look over 25 years old partly because it probably got cleaned up for the DVD, but also because of the expert lighting and cinematography. I can't imagine what it looks like in the HD version.<br /><br />There are some who say that Beatty glorifies communism. I would disagree.  Beatty instead glorifies the act of revolution and idealism whether it is the free love movement or the revolution against war and for the liberation of workers. There is excitement of political organizing and passion of actually overturning oppression. This is why many would feel the first part of Reds is better than the second. The second part shows the consequences of the revolution whether it is hurting a lover or finding that the revolt only replaced tyranny with tyranny.<br /><br />I really appreciate the inter-cutting of interviews with witnesses to that time in history. These men and women knew the main characters in the film and share their opinions and remembrances with great charm.<br /><br />At 195 minutes, the film is rather long -- too long. The film would have benefited from tighter editing and little less indulgence. With that being said, this film earns a solid B and is worth a watch.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Director David Lynch is one of the most bizzare directors of our time.  Once again, he continues to keep our interests in check with a spinning web of intrigue and danger.  Naomi Watts is one of the most promissing actresses in Hollywood. Her performance as Betty, the naive actress from Deep River, Ontario (just east of Ottawa) is genuine and sincere.  Laura Elena Herring's pressence as Rita is just mezzmerising.  She's one of the most beautiful women I've scene on film.  The camera just loves her!  However, the film story and plot is enough to frustrate the average viewer.  If you've scene some of Lynch's other work (minus \\"Dune\\", \\"The Straight Story\\" and \\"The Elephant Man\\"), you'll know you're in for a challenge.  Fans of \\"Twin Peaks\\" will enjoy this one!  Aside from the twists and turns and the bizarre sub-plots, this film is 80% percent good, 100% percent weird!
B000MXPE7O|1.0|I was very optimistic when I watched this film. I expected a good or excellent movie. WOW was I wrong. First of all, I was totally baffled by the main character, played by Matt Damon, as he was  lifeless and only had like three lines in the whole movie.This is the only movie I've ever seen where the main character didn't speak.  Why were women attracted to him? I've never been attracted to mutes myself. Also the plot was a confusing, jumbled mess. I think this film committed the worst crime possible-it didn't give the viewer a reason to care about the characters or the plot.It was also a very boring film.Considering all the critics' hype I was expecting at least a marginally enjoyable film. Alas, not so.<br /><br />Also, wierdly, the deleted scenes are also very long and boring<br /><br />I hope Ocean's 13 and The Bourne Ultimatum will be more enjoyable. But I'm not holding my breath.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I have highly anticipated a new Michael Buble CD since his last one came out.  It is hard to immediately have new \\"favorite\\" songs, since I have every word and note from all his other CD's memorized.  It happened though.  \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\" and \\"I'm Your Man\\" are just a couple of songs that make me want to drive around in my car with the top down and sing along.  While not every song is what I would consider unforgettable, I still do like EVERY song.  They all have their own something special about them.  Michael has stated in several interviews that he wanted to stay true to himself and the music he loves. This is obvious in the classics, as well as the two new songs he wrote.  The band is wonderful as well.  Alan Chang returns as the consummate pianist, bringing his own special style to the CD. I would highly recommend this CD to men and women, children and the elderly.  Keep up the good work!  I look forward to many years of listening to your wonderful music and seeing your highly entertaining live performances.
B00005JPD0|1.0|Ok, I sort of knew before watching this movie that it was going to be stupid. I have to say that this film was mildly enjoyable, but only very mildly. This movie is VERY predictable. Also, I decided within the first few minutes that the filmmakers obviously thought they shouldn't ruin a good film with things like logic and continuity. One scene in particular is so ridiculous that even Denzel wasn't believing it. Also, the filmmakers went out of their way to make sure the audience knew that this film was not anti-muslim terrorist. So the villain was a terrorist with no motivation, other than (like any good terrorist really) hating the US government for no reason(I mean,that's not offensive is it?). Here's another thing-what happened to Val Kilmer? He seems to have swelled like a south american toad. Its really not becoming. I think the essential statement made by this film is that viewers are so stupid it doesn't matter that the movie is illogical,predictable, unscientific because they'll watch it anyways. All I have to say is I my sister rented it, so don't blame me.
B00005JPD0|5.0|This was a Great Movie! It had me Guessing all the way through! Very Good! ~Phillips~
B00005MP58|5.0|The cast was really carefully chosen. I could not praise more their interpretations. Colin Firth will be for ever in my mind as Mr. Darcy.
B00005JPAO|5.0|It's true what everyone says - this is a fantastic movie.  The choice to put Helen in as the Queen was superb.  She does a brilliant job and sometimes you almost can't believe that she isn't the real Queen.  Tony Blair was also really well cast and the actor did a fantastic job in looks and voice. <br />It doesn't always show the Queen in good light.  She made some poor decisions after Diana's death.  She took her sweet time in addressing the public and she didn't lower the flag at the Palace among other things.  It shows some real footage from news bulletins and a little of the funeral prossesion and it kept William and Harry away from the spotlight (therefore keeping some of their privacy). <br />There is fantastic acting in this and one thing I really liked about this is that it gives you a semi real glimpse into the mysterious life of a bizzare family and what happened behind the scenes after the death of their former daughter-in-law, wife and mother.  I really liked it and I was glad to finally get around to watching it yesterday.  I can't believe it took me so long.  I highly recommend it.
0930289528|5.0|This is more or less the graphic novel that led to the box office hit.  The art work is almost the same as the original but with some minor tweaks.  In all aspects almost perfect port of the original, the only major difference is on the front cover it has \\"Now a major motion picture\\" which completly takes away from the original look but i guess that doesn't really matter unless you're trying to pass a reprint off as an original
B000NA2776|5.0|New, fresh, danceable, hummable, intelligent and fun!  Such a new kind of singer and musician, makes this cd a must have.
B000099T3P|4.0|This movie was just as much fun as the first time I saw it! What's not to love? Alien's that eat everything in sight and cause trouble across the universe. Shape shifting alien bounty hunters. And a small town invaded by Critters. Nice.
B00008YJH5|4.0|\\"Surfer Rosa\\" is an excellent example of artful sloppiness, the musical equivalent to the Tower of Pisa. The vocals wobble out of tune, the guitars spill over beats, and the drums slur drunkenly. Only Deal's rock-solid bass keeps things from imploding. <br /> <br />And that's the charm. The utter lack of pretension and the gleeful performances make \\"Surfer Rosa\\" a joy to listen to. While the recording could benefit from remastering and the songs can become repetitive, it's just too much fun to pass up.
B000OCXFCO|1.0|Metallica's abandoned son returns with another sorry excuse for a \\"heavy metal\\" album.<br /><br />Rust In Peace was the last killer album from this thrash metal outfit and each release has degraded ever more. This latest offering was painful, embarrassing and tiresome.<br /><br />All the tracks were hashed together and showed none of the old Megadeth creativity. Probably since Mustaine has alienated himself from so many good idea sources leaving him struggling to resurrect the old Deth. Sorry Dave, Megadeth was never just Dave Mustaine.<br /><br />It's always amusing to see a band crash and burn when they come out and claim to have found (g)od. They try to pump out the same old anti-government lyrics but they no longer have meaning. Weightless ramblings of a bitter man.<br /><br />Megadeth were once in the big four, now they're not even worth a review in Kerrang.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this shiny coaster.
B000O178BY|5.0|Year Zero is a dramatic departure from Reznor's prior work, both in tone and subject. His message is political instead of psychological, and the music is more synthesized and more percussive, with several songs revolving around heavily-processed drum loops. Additionally, the music is only part of the experience. The viral marketing campaign is not only an excellent example of advertising as entertainment, but it places the album in context and makes it much more enjoyable to listen to.[...]    Alienated fans notwithstanding, Year Zero is superb. If you can appreciate political commentary and electronic music, buy this album.
B000274THQ|5.0|I first heard about this movie a week ago after reading an article in which a commentator described it as being a bit of \\"communist chic.\\" This intrigued me so I had to check it out. Well, I'm happy to report that the fellow's opinion was nonsense. It's no more accurate a perception than one that misconstrued The Beatles \\"Back in the USSR\\" as an ode to the Soviet Union. This is not a propagandistic story in the least. It's a beautiful film about love, family, and truth. Basically, the central question concerns whether or not we should lie to loved ones if we think the lie will ultimately benefit them. The answer is not easy for the main characters or the audience. Goodbye, Lenin! provides us with ambiguity after ambiguity and is rife with the same nuance that fills our own lives. I saw nothing offensive about this film; indeed, it is a valuable work of art.
0375823352|4.0|In book 3 of His Dark Materials triology all major characters must prove their worth, must make dire but unavoidable decisions and live with the consequences. Even though the story continues to shadow Will and Lyra and their struggles, it somehow becomes less personal as well. In part that's the case because the other characters in the book get more story time because things have to be described and explained.<br /><br />As much as I agree with Pullman's message about religion and as much as I wanted the denouement offered in The Amber Spyglass, I still regretted the loss of intimacy I felt with the characters in the first two books especially in The Subtle Knife.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading His Dark Materials you must start with book 1 so you'll understand what's going on and you'll read book 2 because you'll like book 1 and then you'll read book 3 because you'll want to know how it all ends. And then you will see whether you agree or disagree with me on its value.<br /><br />I feel as ambivalent about the end of the book as I did about the book as a whole. At first it seems realistic but then again it doesn't because you cannot live a full life if you hunger for something in another world. Or if you don't hunger for it then you won't return to the bench in the park once a year. This promise or plan destroys the realistic and positive ending in my eyes. But then what did my favorite Bellman from Jurisfiction say? :\\"...every time a book is read by the same person it is different again - because the reader's experiences have changed, or he is in a different frame of mind.\\" so, let me revisit all my reviews on His Dark Materials in a year or so when I re-read the triology and things may look different to me.

B000MRAAJW|4.0|Planet Earth is breath taking in content and picture. Almost all is rendered in smooth high def 1080P. I would have wished though, that they had put a little more effort in creating a more fulfilled sound track to accompany the spectacular settings.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|Now I know why this movie is so hard to find on the shelves at my local rental.  I hope many mothers and daughters are watching.   <br /> <br />\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" not only gives you a perspective on life in the early 50's, it tells you about your mothers and your grandmothers.  It also makes us aware as women about what is yet to be done.   <br /> <br />I won't belabor the plot or the acting.  I will say that every woman needs to watch this with her daughter, her niece, or perhaps her best friend.
6305212112|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time a few years ago and seeing it again was even more fun. Kathy Bates is great in her role and also Jessica Tandy and Mary Stuart Masterson. I loved the movie and someday I will try out those green fried tomatoes.
0316010669|1.0|The main reason I bought this book was because of the promise of teaching you how to improve upon utilizing your gut instinct.  As I progressed through the book, my gut instict was telling me that wasn't going to happen, and it was right. It was just a series of studies and examples of where instinct has worked and where it hasn't.  I didn't read one paragraph where the author instructs on how to improve upon or develop your unconscious decision-making.  The stories are interesting but the book was a big disappointment to me.
0618680004|5.0|Anyone who has read Prof. Dawkins knows that he is concise and articulate, but there is more to say about his extraordinary writing skill.  He consistently succeeds in adding uniquely fresh and inventive touches to nearly any subject, from the most esoteric to the most mundane.  This extra quality is sufficient to place \\"The God Delusion\\" pretty much in a class by itself among works aimed at helping the general reader understand how normal scientific progress has, over time, inexorably revealed fatal weaknesses in virtually all religious claims which specify some sort of observable effects or outcomes.  Prominent among those claims, of course, are the ones establishing a class of supernatural creators and supervisors affectionately known as \\"gods.\\"<br /><br />In the book's initial 160 pages, Dawkins builds a devastating case against the existence of any kind of personal, interactive, creator god.  Enormous consequences ride on this case because the world's three \\"great\\" monotheistic religions have always, despite their occasionally murderous disagreements, had the same ultrapersonal god (Yahweh/Allah) in mind.  In Judaism, Yahweh is the undisputed main man.  Although Christianity is centered on the kinder and gentler persona of Jesus, loss of confidence in the father's existence would also extinguish the sole source of the son's divinity.  The core principles of Islam make it perfectly clear that Muhammad completes the line of prophets from Abraham through Moses to Jesus, so Muslims are, regardless of any delusions of independence, firmly welded by their own doctrine to the Old Testament deity.  Such admirable unity among billions of big-three believers makes Yahweh/Allah an exceptionally large and well-delineated target for rational analysis.  Regarding Y/A's character, chances are Dawkins' frank appraisal of him as a \\"...megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully\\" will ring true to every thoughtful person who has read the Bible without spin from an \\"interpreter.\\"<br /><br />Dawkins doesn't ignore the classic philosophical \\"proofs\\" of god's existence; in fact he devotes all of Chapter 3 to their strengths and weaknesses.  But his main thesis, delivered in Chapter 4, is pragmatic and firmly grounded in science.  The author picks two potent and practical grenades to toss at the glass houses in which personal gods so precariously dwell.  First, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic god suffers severely from a simple lack of evidence because a) events and conditions in the observable world do not suggest the presence of an omniscient, all-powerful overseer, and b) the consistently successful explanations and predictions of modern cosmology and evolutionary biology reveal no scientifically credible requirement for any kind of conscious, sentient creator/designer.<br /><br />The second grenade contains a challenge to the very idea that calling up supreme beings serves any logically valid purpose, or (as a lawyer might put it) has any probative value in solving the mysteries of the universe and our place in it.  Here Dawkins evokes an ingenious and powerful metaphor -- god as the \\"ultimate Boeing 747.\\"  To set the stage, he cites British astronomer Fred Hoyle's attempt to refute evolution by charging that the prospect of living things being formed by random processes is as unlikely as a hurricane sweeping through a junkyard and fortuitously assembling a jetliner. (Hoyle's misunderstanding here seems monumental, since evolution teaches the GRADUAL accumulation of small, initially random changes in germ cell genomes via the decidedly NON-RANDOM process of natural selection.)  The author then picks up Hoyle's logically misdirected cudgel and, this time with valid premises, swings it back at the defenders of supernatural design.  Dawkins' point is that if creationists can't explain where the designer came from and how it acquired its abilities (which do, after all, massively interact with the natural world), then their god iseven more far fetched and intellectually useless than Hoyle's accidentally blown-together airplane.<br /><br />The author rightly charges that preferential coddling of religion is neither justifiable nor beneficial to society -- in fact quite the opposite.  In no way does he advocate censoring beliefs, but instead supports the reasonable view that supernatural claims belong on the level playing field where all other ideas, including scientific ones, fairly compete.  Related to this issue are the sometimes unhelpful contributions of scientists themselves.  For example, in Chapter 2 Dawkins explains how the NOMA (Non-Overlapping Magisteria) slogan, coined by paleontologist Steven Jay Gould, has been used to promote the dubious notion that some sort of uncrossable barrier divides science from religion.  In the interest of avoiding controversy (and preserving grants?), NOMA enthusiasts somehow manage to ignore the constant stream of readily checkable claims emanating from religious sources.  When someone confidently claims the Earth is only a few thousand years old, or prayer works, or guilt transfers across generations, or the Bible originated morality, or evolution fails to account for the full variety of living things, Dawkins asks us to remember that the resources and methods of science can and should be used routinely to help decide whether such assertions are credible.<br /><br />Dawkins' discussion of the changing moral zeitgeist (Chapter 7) is particularly interesting and, I believe, significant.  \\"Zeitgeist\\" is a German term meaning \\"spirit of the times,\\" an index of people's collective attitudes through history.  In addition to many depressing examples of morally brain-dead attitudes in the Bible, Dawkins provides striking reminders of how recently our current views on such issues as universal suffrage and racial equality were formed.  He supports his case with some absolutely appalling quotes from T.H. Huxley (\\"Darwin's bulldog\\"), Abraham Lincoln and H.G. Wells.  On the other hand, the positive side of zeitgeist drift is the rapidity with which social attitudes can change for the better when, after long stagnation, a tipping point is finally reached.  A prime example is the drastic rejection of smoking which is happening today in response to overwhelming medical evidence.  Perhaps it is not futile to hope that the words of Prof. Dawkins and many other voices of reason are, even now, stirring the wave of understanding which will eventually free billions of basically kind and intelligent people from the tragically false and harmful grip of supernatural pipe dreams.god is even more far fetched and intellectually useless than Hoyle's accidentally blown-together airplane.   <br /> <br />The author rightly charges that preferential coddling of religion is neither justifiable nor beneficial to society -- in fact quite the opposite.

B0002W18MU|5.0|I am by no means a fan of country music. Most of it does not interest me. One of the few artists I love and can proudly admit is Johnny Cash. Johnny has such a wonderfully rich, warm voice that always brings a tear to my eye. I recently came across his last album \\"American V: A Hundred Highways\\" at my local library. I didn't think he could outdo \\"American IV: The Man Who Came Around\\" but he did with this album. The twelve song album is a haunting reminder of the legendary singer/songwriter. I could hear in his voice that the man in black was coming towards the end of his life. I could hear the weariness in his voice. I mean that in a good way. I think his weariness added an emotional depth to each song that is rarely heard in music nowadays. Rick Rubin did a great job of maintaining an intimate, raw sound to the album. I felt like I was in the studio watching Johnny performing. I loved every song. Johnny sang with such heartfelt conviction that it broke my heart. May the man in black rest in peace. He will always be missed.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is one of those movies that you want to add to your DVD collection. Its simply devine. One of last years best. I'd actually rank it a tad higher than the Prestige, a stunning movie in its own right with the similar subject, setting, and likely era.
B000001ES9|5.0|I think this is a very good first album and enjoy listening to it time and time again. This album has a nice raw feel to it and the band didn't have the resources to spend much time in the studio, but I think that is a good thing here. There are no keyboards or much else other than the guitar, bass and drums. &#34;Working Man&#34; is probably the strongest song on the album, but I think that all these songs are of good quality &#34;Finding My Way&#34; has one of my favorite riffs and &#34;What You're Doing&#34; and &#34;In The Mood&#34; have been performed live a lot over the years.  This is the only album without Neil Peart, but the drummer on this album John Rutsey is a very good drummer and his style does suits these songs well.
B000M341QE|1.0|Love the all star cast: Nicholson, Damon, DiCaprio, de Niro, Sheen, Baldwin, etc.  Hated the story line. I had such high hopes for this movie. What a waste of such great talent, infact each one of which have a prominent place in my DVD collection.  It would have been nice to add this movie aswell - but it just plain sucked.  It was so incredibly long and boring at times that I had to watch it over 2 nites, and the second night I was just reluctant to even continue. I am amazed people would see this more than once. If you like being depressed at the end of your movie experience, and really not getting anything remotely out of them, this is for you!

0060594896|5.0|I purchased this book on the recommendation from a co-worker.  I read Chapter One, from her copy, and was hooked.  This book has totally transformed my life.  After reading The Success Principles, I found the strength and confidence to pursue my life's passion to turn my love of cooking into a career.  I felt like Mr. Canfield was personally speaking to me with each chapter I read.  This book is profound, and I challenge anyone to read this book and work the exercises, and not be a changed person. I know I am, because I now know how to get from where I am, to where I want to be!<br /><br />Thank You Mr. Canfield
B000P6R6X8|5.0|Wilco keeps on making great music.  As with the last couple albums, it took me a couple listens to really get the full feel of the music.  It is wonderful.  I am very happy I got the CD/DVD set.  The DVD is well produced and shot.  It gives you some insight on the songs and the band dynamic.  It is well worth the extra couple bucks.  Highly recommended!!!
B0001GMIOE|4.0|I ordered this battery as a replacement to the one that came with my camera.  I have only had the battery for a short time and used the camera about four times since the initial charge. So far the battery has held its charge and is working great.  <br /> <br />
B000MCH5P4|1.0|This movie is so overrated! I found it boring, confusing, with no plot and no resolution at the end. You will literally end the movie thinking \\"and the point of it all was...?????\\". I am still wondering how in the world it ended being nominated for an Oscar (I guess Paramount had money to buy a nomination). I like movies to challenge my intelligence, not insult it. And I felt very insulted to have wasted almost three hours watching this garbage.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Never have I seen such detail and quality of our planet, and the life on it, until now. BBC and all of those involved in this production, invested their best efforts and resources to record this fine historical view. I felt like a kid in awe watching this. I think the crews out there, also felt that way while making it... Highest recommendation to sit down and watch this. You will be amazed and thrilled!
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I love how Neil talks about his ranch in telling the story of the inspiration of the song \\"Old Man\\".  His telling of his relationship with his ranch foreman shows his good humor during this set.  This set is personal, full of emotion, and strong with wonderful performances of the songs.  It's interesting to hear the audience reaction to the \\"new songs\\" in the set.  \\"New songs\\" that are now classics. <br /> <br />I was only one month old when this concert took place.  I wonder if Neil Young would have ever imagined an infant at the time of the concert would enjoy the recording decades later. <br /> <br />I had 4 of Neil's live recordings before I purchased this set.  This collection ranks as high to me as his Live Rust, Weld, and the MTV Unplugged recordings.  I daresay that this recording maybe even stronger. <br />
B000021YQV|5.0|Working backwards from their latest album Hypnotize, I landed on Toxicity and it blew me away. I am a huge fan of their newest album, but after hearing Toxicity it became clear why the SOAD purists say what they say. Toxicity is truly astonishing. If you are a metal fan but have not heard this album yet, consider yourself in for a treat. This is practically a genre-defining album. What fun Rick Rubin must have had putting the icing on this incredible piece of work! Toxicity is progressive, aggressive, juvenile, and reminds us of the startling fact that, yes, they're STILL trying to build a prison! Another prison system, for me and you...
0743298020|5.0|A slow start made me wonder if i would find that story entertaining at its end, but it totaly found my heart, with its simple events, beautifully described, and puzzling all at once,Diane wraps everything up in the end in such a way, it will satisfy your curiosity about any loose ends, and you wont find an inner question of yours not answered.
B00005JPCF|3.0|This was a alright movie, with all the hype I expected more, didn't keep my daughters attention.
0060090367|2.0|Having started this book eagerly after \\"Is Anyone Out There?\\", I was amazed it was the same author. This book had a good story line possibility: however it never filled out. I didn't like Claire by midpoint of the book, and it didn't get better. She was so wishywashy about everything! And by the time she and James were meeting to talk, I felt she deserved him. He seemed a bit of a sociopath to me, and many parts just didn't seem to add up at all. At the end I didn't care what happened to her. I had ordered this book along with several others.Thankfully, \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" was next, and renewed my faith in Ms. Keyes.
B00000DCHD|4.0|Hot on the heels of the smash hit that \\"The Stranger\\" was, Billy Joel deals us 52nd Street.  It is a capable , listenable product, but the material here leaves me not as enthusiastic as that in the previous album. <br /> <br />The album opens with \\"Big Shot,\\" a tough rocker with a bitter attitude about a misbehaven girlfriend.  The aggressive power-riff guitar introduction leads into this mean-spirited rocker.  But then that is followed up with the sappy, bitter \\"Honesty\\".  Even though not his best, he's still ahead of the pop music game even when he's not in top form.  The hit \\"My Life\\" is on this album, too; here's Joel's seemingly blunt statement about self-assertion.  \\"Zanzibar\\" is an uneven, but ultimately fascinating long piece; it has blatant jazz overtones in it up to its jazzy trumpet solo.  Don't expect the same kind of thematic music here that you got in the previous album's Italian Restaurant.\\"  In Rosalinda's Eyes, Joel references latin sounds with rather cornball effects; still, the end result in infectious enough. <br /> <br />Despite it not quite being up to the high standards of \\"The Stranger\\" the album still sold millions.
0060090383|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Although much of the content was sad, it was so well written that you are unable to put it down. All of us have known addicts or been one; her description of the stages Rachel went through was very good. However, as others have observed, my favorite part of this book was the love story between Rachel and Luke. And this was a love story-of Rachel learning how to love herself as well. Hope to hear much more about Luke and Rachel: how about another book just for these two? A must read.
0751532711|1.0|Didn't care for this book, for all the reasons listed here and more.  His advice is spotty at best, and at often times crosses into the illegal category.  He writes about incorporating so you can buy yourself things like cars and save on taxes (since business are taxed on income after expenses).  Nothing wrong with this, except be prepared to prove that those expenses are for the business and not personal use.  Unless you're spending all the time driving the \\"company car\\" for business purposes, its tax evasion and its illegal.  This was just one example among my dislike for this book
B000OCXFCO|5.0|It sounds like our Dave is back and he is PISSED OFF! The next great Megadeth album is upon us. The Nay sayers can't be listening to the same CD as me. Awsome stuff! If you are a fan of Megadeth get it.<br /><br /> P.S. Metallica the bar has been raised yet again. You guys have some serious catching up to do if you can ever get your stuff out there. My advice stop slacking.

B0002XMF5I|1.0|Ian Gillan is a good singer but he is a good Deep Purple singer, not Black Sabbath.  Maybe he could have been a better singer/song writer for Sabbath if he has more drive while in the group.  Dio had just left so there was high expectations but this album just failed to deliver.  The lyrics were very poorly done by Black Sabbath standards and even Iommi's amazing riffage is few and far between on this one.  This was a name sale for those involved, Sabbath needed a singer and Gillan wanted a quick buck before re-joining Deep Purple.  I mean we even got a Highway Star redub on here called Hot Line for lack of ideas and Smoke On The Water added to Sabbath's live set....
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is an excellent quality DVD and I highly recommend it. Some of the songs are from the first DVD but in a different atmosphere.  New singer, Hayley, is excellent too.  Really enjoy this DVD; can watch it over and over again.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The Bourne Supremacy picks up two years after the original film ended and continues to shed light on Jason Bourne's adventures.  The former assassin returns to Europe to find out why he is still hunted down by the CIA.  Matt Damon, Karl Urban (from LOR!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well (Matt Damon is once again amazing in his respective role!).   Moreover, it was a pleasure to see the lovely Julia Stiles, though a bit more exposure would have been just right...   Overall, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good.   In short, The Bourne Supremacy is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!
0307383415|5.0|In Dreams from my Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance, Senator Barack Obama talks about his life growing up and the numerous challenges he faces. The book begins in the 1960's when Barack is a young boy living in Hawaii. He lives with his white mother and grandparents after his father, a Kenyan prince, has returned to Kenya to work. Later on in the memoir, his mother meets an Indonesian man whom she marries. Barack and his mom then move to Indonesia with the man and they all start a life together. In Indonesia, Barack is faced with the challenges of learning a new culture. A culture that was dark and dangerous, one he says would \\"quickly make a child into a man.\\" After a while, Barack's mother begins to see what this environment is doing to her son. He is becoming a man, but one that is scared to share his feeling because he wants to seem tough and supportive of other people. His mother then sends him home to Hawaii, so he will know what it is like to grow up as an American. There, he faces another challenge. He is one of only two black people in his class. After graduating from high school at the Punahou School in Hawaii and Occidental College in California, Barack then moves to Chicago. In the windy city, he becomes a community organizer where he works to help makes neighborhoods safer in Chicago's Southside. He works with many people that have the same beliefs and goals as him. Unlike Barack, his Chicago colleagues have grown up knowing about their black heritage. They have also experienced more of the hardship they are trying to fight against.  One day while he is working in Chicago, he gets a phone call from his sister in Kenya informing him that their father has died. After spending his entire life trying to figure himself out and understand his culture and heritage, Barack sees this as a good opportunity to learn about the man most like him, his father, and the place in which his father lived.   <br />Throughout the book, we watch a young boy grow into aman and face the struggles of growing up, finding out his true identity, learning about his black heritage, and adapting to the different cultures in which he lived.  <br />With his thoughtful, powerful, and poignant writing style Barack is able to portray the true facts: \\"I realized that who I was, what I cared about, was no longer just a matter of intellect or obligation, no longer a construct of words. I saw that my life in America - the black life, the white life, the sense of abandonment I'd felt as a boy, the frustration and hope I witnessed in Chicago - all of it was connected with this small plot of earth an ocean away, connected by more than the accident of a name or the color of my skin. The pain I felt was my father's pain. My questions were my brother's questions. Their struggles, my birthright.\\" <br />This book is a definite read. Barack Obama is able to capture his reader and keep them wanting more. Once I began reading it, I was not able to put the book down. You become captivated by all the hardships that he faces in his life and the way that he learns to fight through them and find himself in the end. This is a wonderful story because Barack is not afraid to hide anything. He is willing to tell people all about his life and let them know what made him the type of person he is today. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to everyone.   <br />
B00023B1LC|3.0|The Bourne Identity brings to the screen the story of a young man dragged out of the Mediterranean Sea and without a clue as to who he is.  His only lead is a bank account in Zurich.  His problems, however, have only just begun...  Matt Damon is amazing in his respective role though the rest of the cast fail to follow with the exception of lovely Julia Stiles who seems to have quite a bit of potential.    The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good, but nothing extraordinary.

B0000B1OE7|2.0|And lots of it. I was kind of turned off. I'm new to anime films, and going off of Amazon listmania's I found this film as a top favorite of many. I don't really see why, there are far better one's out there. It seems there are many of these films that go out of their way to go \\"over the top\\" with graphic sex and extreme gore and violence. The rape scene of the main female character was particularly disturbing. In my opinion, the story really doesn't make up for it. By the time I figured out what this movie was even about I grew so disgusted with all of the character's I didn't really care who won. <br /> <br />Wonderful artwork is this film's only redeeming quality. Not worth the experience, though.
B000051Y0G|5.0|One of the greatest female artist albums of all time, in the pop/rock genre.  I have never tired of listening occasionally.  (The haunting \\"Time After Time\\" is one of my favorite tunes of all time).<br /><br />Nicely remastered and there are 3 bonus tracks of live performances of songs that are on the original album playlist: \\"Money Changes Everything\\", \\"She Bop\\", and \\"All Through The Night\\".  I prefer the studio versions, but they are on there too. If you are not familiar with this album, I'll just say that there's something there for everyone. Not much \\"filler\\" here.<br /><br />The original recording quality was exceptionally strong in my opinion, and I'm not quite sure if this reissue is of that level. But it seems to be quite good and this is certainly a 5 star product.<br /><br />Recommended.

B000OCXFCO|4.0|I thought I'd write something for the newer fans like myself. I've heard them on radio and saw videos on MTV back when they actually played VIDEOS. The first cd I finally bought was \\"Greatest Hits - back to the start\\" So of course after playing it 200 times I couldn't wait for THIS new cd. Like any new release, it's seems disappointing but the more you listen the more you like. The new line up sounds as good as the old too.    I was afraid of Leftist propaganda, but the title was a good sign Dave hasn't turned stupid. Sure enough the \\"UN\\" song nails what a useless corrupt entity it is. Love it! Too bad few know who Kojo is.     \\"Sleepwalker\\" is a little creepy, if he had mentioned maybe killing child molesters that would've been good.  The wag the dog reference (from the 90's) made me wonder if it's a slam at Bill Clinton. He is the one that did nothing after the first World Trade Center attack in 1993... which brought on the second attack. The overall political feel is a perfect balance of War is terrible/a neccessary evil. Both sides can read into it what they want (clever move Dave). Though I think the inside jacket with the \\"24\\" reference and the additional slamming of the United Nations etc explains the inspiration. The UN jerked us around for 1 year and 3 months before we went into Iraq. Of course the WMD's that America said were there (as did England, Germany, Italy, France etc) were no where. If you had a illegal things in your house and the cops said they'd search your house in the coming year...what would you do with those items??    WMD's are out there somewhere-and Dave gets it. \\"we adhere to resolutions expecting the enemy to do the same\\" You can feel the anger in him at the suffering of war, the need to keep improving better killing weapons so we're not killed, (\\"Gears of War\\") and the frustration of knowing we have to do this so we don't turn into Amerikhastan. \\"Hey Jihad Joe, we're coming to get you\\".     \\"Never walk alone\\" is a nice nod to Jesus, Idon't know who else he could possibly mean, not to mention the gospel song \\"never walk alone\\". \\"Burnt Ice\\" is a good anti-drug song, and Dave should know. The remake of \\"A tout le monde\\" sounds about the same to me, except with a girl singing too. I do wish this cd wasn't SO political, a little escapism is nice but given the title, what else could the theme be?. I definately recommend this and for the newer fans, you HAVE to get \\"Greatest Hits Back to the Start\\".    Pls don't comment with ignorant anti-war bilge, we all want peace but the ones who want to kill us for not bowing to Allah (making us Infidels to be killed) AND being friends with Israel beg to differ. I won't read any comments to play it safe ;-D
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Okay, to start off, \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is not the return to form that old fans still pining for the sequel to \\"2112\\" have been wanting for decades. That Rush is long gone. And that is not a bad thing. Rush has never been a band that does the same thing over and over, or a band that wants to revisit the past, so why should they start now?     On to the new record...it is a grower. It has some of the best melodies they have written in a long time, Neil Peart's lyrics are still as potent as ever, and, to the delight of this listener, there is more acoustic guitar than on any other Rush album to date.     From a playing standpoint, this is Alex Lifeson's record. No, he does not dazzle us with solos left and right, although there are a few nice ones, but his playing throughout the record is top-notch. Some have called him the weak link in the band before, usually because of how prolific his bandmates are, but he owns \\"Snakes and Arrows.\\" Geddy Lee and Neil Peart do their usual great job, too, don't get me wrong, but Lifeson's star shines the brightest.     As I mentioned earlier, this album is a grower. The more you listen to it, the more those melodies get in your head, and before you know it, you can't get the cd out of your disc player. Every song is at least good, and quite a few range from very good to great, especially \\"Armor and Sword,\\" \\"Bravest Face,\\" \\"The Way the Wind Blows,\\" \\"The Main Monkey Business,\\" and \\"Malignant Narcissism.\\"     Is is their best album ever? No. Is it their best album since \\"Moving Pictures,\\" their classic from 1981? No. But it is a very good record, and for a bunch of guys in their 50's, who have been together for over 30 years, it is awfully impressive.

You have thin-sliced him and found him wanting\\" (p. 43).<br /><br />\\"Perhaps the most common -- and the most important -- forms of rapid cognition are the judgments we make and the impressions we form of other people.  Every waking minute that we are in the presence of someone, we come up with a constant stream of predictions and inferences about what that person is thinking and feeling.... We easily parse complex distinctions in facial expression.... You wouldn't need to hear anything I was saying in order to reach these conclusions.  They would just come to you, BLINK\\" (p. 194-195).<br /><br />In Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, author Malcolm Gladwell (The Tipping Point) discusses that \\"first impression,\\" the \\"BLINK\\" moment, or the \\"thin-slice\\" of cognitive judgment.  He basically is saying that gut feelings are more often right than wrong. Unless... they are wrong.<br /><br />Gladwell gives examples of the subtle reasons why, in vocal inflections, facial tics, or some other type of unknown mechanism leading to our impressions of people, things, or events, we know something is \\"wrong\\" immediately.  In fact, he argues that some issues are pretty darn predictable from those first few precious seconds of exposure:  lying, incompetency, forgery, longevity of marriage, and evaluation of musical talent.<br /><br />I agree, to a degree.  I find his case history summaries intriguing and interesting.  I've participated in the Harvard Implicit Association Test.

And, like most humans that have ever lived, I've had my own \\"gut feelings\\" that I've regretted not paying closer attention to.<br /><br />Gladwell made the same mistake in his best-seller The Tipping Point, however.  He \\"reverse-engineered\\" the issues.  An event happens.  Later, somebody (usually not Gladwell) goes back to see if there was a clue to the lie, the malpractice, the divorce, or the hiring bias.  Ah-HA... there is the clue!  [Read -- there is the tipping point.]  You would think, however, with something so clear-cut -- we now know the behaviors (or lack thereof) of liars, spys, mistake-prone surgeons, and cheating spouses -- that we could USE these behavioral cues in court, in police investigations, in premarital discussions (perfect for those required church premarital conferences), and in choosing a physician (see that first quote in my review, above).<br /><br />But we don't.  In part, this is because Gladwell also notes cases where those \\"thin-slices\\" of impressions are wildly and catastrophically wrong.<br /><br />Ah-ha.<br /><br />So, I am intrigued but not convinced.  This IS interesting stuff, and I thank Gladwell for summarizing it for me.  I need more evidence, more studies, and a demonstration of greater utility.<br /><br />Oh, and do you think that there is a \\"tipping point\\" in the \\"thin slicing\\" when we unconsciously flip our impression from one conclusion to another?

B000O75F7C|4.0|Porcupine Tree is one of my three favorite bands in the world at the moment, so it pains me to say this...I am a bit underwhelmed by \\"Fear of a Blank Planet.\\"  If this were the first cd by the band I had heard, I would probably be overwhelmed by it, and gushing over it non-stop, but sadly, that is not the case.<br /><br />Still, this is a very enjoyable cd, which is no surprise, since it seems like the band is incapable of making a bad or even average cd, their debut, \\"On the Sunday of Life,\\" notwithstanding, which was more like a Steven Wilson solo album, anyway.  The problem is, while very good, it is not consuming me like past PT records have.  In fact, I would say it has no chance of breaking into my top 5 PT albums list, which consists of the five full-length studio albums prior to this one (\\"Signify,\\" \\"Stupid Dream,\\" \\"Lightbulb Sun,\\" \\"In Absentia,\\" and \\"Deadwing\\").<br /><br />The songs are all at least really good, as is the norm with a Porcupine Tree record..  The beast of an epic called \\"Anesthetize\\" is too stunning to describe with words.  You just have to hear it.  The title track is a good rocker, and manages to sound \\"Deadwing\\"-ish at times.  The finale, \\"Sleep Together,\\" closes out the record with a beautiful string arrangement.<br /><br />Overall, I give it 4 stars out of 5.
B00001OH1S|4.0|I wanted to get The Thomas Crown Affair Soundtrack for one reason only: The Sinnerman by Nina Simone, because I was not able to find this particular version anywhere else. And yet this song...it is simply great. When I first heard it, I could feel shivers down my spine, and have felt the same ever since. But to be completely honest, I do like the rest of the CD. Unfortunately, there is not much left. The soundtrack is rather short (31' approximately), and...well...jazzy, which is not exactly my cup of tea, but still, it was worth getting it. It is a nice, relaxing listening. Apart from The Sinnerman, of course. That one makes me feel exhilirated and  strong and...well, happy.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|Linkin Park, let's hope on your 4th album you go back to your original formula (if there's a 4th album).  It's like changing the formula of Coke or Pepsi.  And you guys just changed your formula to crappola! <br /> <br />What's up with all the clapping sounds?  I thought I was listening to My Chemical Romance!!!  Is this music suppose to conform to that crappy EMO music the teenie-boppers just love.   <br /> <br />I've seen these guy multiple times at concerts, and always left their shows feeling good inside.  This CD left me feeling like I went out all night on a drinking binge, then smashing my car into a wall. <br /> <br />This CD just plain sucks.  All music now-a-days just plain sucks too. Every one wants to be so different.  Being unique is fine, but being this unique leaves me feeling like I wasted 9.99. <br /> <br />I'll put this trash on my IPOD, just out of respect for them.  But I really can't get through this CD.  Linkin if this was your first CD, you would've never made a second-that's for sure. <br /> <br />Linkin I hope your next album is better.  I love the others.  Peace!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|After watching the G,B and U, I knew I had seen the best western ever.  Which is saying a lot since I was a western flick junkie and saw all the westerns ever shown on tv and in the theaters. <br /> <br />Then came Once Upon A Time in the West.  <br />Sergio Leone's directing and photography and Ennio Morricone's music had gone from wonderful to magnificent.  The storyline was mysterious with the Man with the Harmonica's (Charles Bronson) denouement into a stunning climax with a flashback to him as a boy holding his brother with a noose around his neck,on his shoulders, and the totally evil Henry Fonda sticking a harmonica in his mouth just before Bronson collapses, hanging his brother. Then Fonda's final realization who Bronson is, but to late to avoid his own death.   <br /> <br />This flick had a great opening scene with 3 of Fonda's henchmen waiting for Bronson at the train station.  Bronson asks where is his horse, and Jack Elam replies:  \\"Guess we are shy one horse\\".  Bronson's reply:  \\"No you brought two too many!\\"  Then the rapid shooting leaving the 3 bad guys dead. <br /> <br />There are many scenes and characters like the opening which transcend the previous HOllywoodized westerns.  You feel the dirt and dusty west and you hear it, even the smallest sounds punctuate the scene.  The heroes are a bandit (Jason Robard), a previous prostitute (Claudia Cardinale), and the mysterious man with a harmonica and of few words who kills people trying to kill Fonda, saving him for the climax (Charles Bronson).  And the most evil Henry Fonda, slaughtering an entire family including the small boy because his cohort says his name. <br /> <br />I truly believe Leone and Morricone designed and created their final western masterpiece with ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and my favorite. <br /> <br /> <br />

B000NA28IE|1.0|Good grief. I would easily give this movie \\"0\\" stars if it was an option. These books are fun and it's inspiring that a teenager could write them. They are enjoyable to read and Mr. Paolini has quite the vision. But the movie just feels like, \\"quick! let's cash in on LOTR and be done with it\\". I know it's not fair to compare books and movies of those books but, come on! They dropped SO much plot and detail and it was all over sooooo fast! I couldn't even believe the ending! This belongs in the same realm as the debacle that was \\"The Beach\\", another horrific adaptation of a great book. And I certainly hope that one of the reviewers who said it was \\"every bit as good as LOTR\\" hasn't seen or read the Lord of the Rings trilogy. If they have then, shame on you!

B000O178BY|5.0|Year Zero is one of the best that Trent Reznor has come up with to date. The tones blend right into each other, and when listened to in conjunction of all the sites that he has put up for to promote this new album, take the experience to a whole new degree. However, there are no hard-hitting songs on this particular album, but that is the only downside. The music and lyrics more than make up for this.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Some musical artists come along once in a generation.  Josh Groban is one of them.  This artist has natural talent that was developed as a child then sharpened to a point by performances all over the world.  His arrow sharp style and accuracy will penetrate your soul and lift you up spiritually.  No one can walk away from his music and still feel down.  A Japanese musical expert used scientific data to prove Josh Groban's voice has healing qualities.  This talent is a gift from Heaven.  No, Groban may not be perfect; he is a man and people are not perfect, but it is my personal opinion that God placed Josh Groban here for a purpose.  So, as Josh Groban makes a \\"Joyful Noise\\" enjoy!<br /><br />PS All people can enjoy his music, young and old, religious and non religious, women and men etc.  Uplifting music is meant for everyone!
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I've been a Rush fan since Permanent Waves.  What I like most about them is that their music is unpredictable and that they continue to be thoughtful in their lyrics, in a world where pop music is simply rhyme to a beat, Rush continues to say something in their music. <br />Not on Snakes and Arrows, though.  I found the music dull and predictable.  Good lyrics, but they didn't really speak to me, let alone move me.   <br />Glad to have the guys back for more, and it's a great improvement over Vapor Trails, but it does little for me.

B000EQ47HC|4.0|Continuing the theme from the first album, the only thing this lacks is 'progress' in the sense that the sound was codified in the first album and remains the same here. Where does the first album end and the second album begin.<br /><br />As a musician, I like to see growth in the sound of a band, and in the writing. Boston's only lack here, and on their third album, too, is that their sound is so set in stone that there is no growth in this regard. They're stuck. Future albums I've heard are not the same, actually a digression, like de-evolution, going backward. I don't know, haven't heard them.<br /><br />All I can say is that while the writing is consistent -- a must for my continued interest, the sound remains the same. And that is often a bad thing because people change and the music, and its sound, should reflect that change, be a part of that change.<br /><br />However, all that said, if you liked the first album, you'll like this one. Only a couple less than great songs are on this effort. Most bands should do this well in their creative processes. I wish they would learn to spend the time necessary to create something worth recording as Boston did, even if it is sonically the same as the first.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|After Rick Rubin produced a Rock Album of the year by taking some of the Funk out of RHCP's Califunk for Stadium Arcadium, he helped Linkin Park take the rock and the rap out of their unique brand of Rap-Rock.  It didn't work quite as well, in fact this is a complete dud.  My favorite song is Bleed it Out, and this song really rocks.  What I've Done has a haunting piano piece like In the End, but is really really repetitive lyrically.  Some of the politics that come into the music are usually what I like to hear artists say to express themselves, but for Linkin Park I don't think it works as well.  However, I gotta admit Hands Held High is pretty good.  I honestly thought that I had put in The Fray CD when I heard the Shadow of the Day intro.  Yea, pretty much too soft, too slow.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I just received the package, everything intact, and viewing this HD DVD every evening. The series is stunning with some breathtaking aerial shots and inaccessible places which you will never visit in your life-time. Truly a magnum opus from stables of BBC. I purchased one with the legendary David Attenborough narrated set. Though his way of presentation is good he seems to swallow some of the narrations, perhaps he has become too old. I thought the narrations of Alastair Fothergill was far more clearer based on the trailers that i saw. Nevertheless we are treated to a series, for which a lot of hardwork has gone from the cameramen & the crew who have brought this biggest and the majestic sights of our Mother Earth in supreme clarity. To sum up, an unimaginable & ultimate portrait of the planet we all live in.
B00006I53S|5.0|I bought this lens when I got my Digital Rebel XTi and I absolutely love it.  The price put me off a bit (at the time I didn't realize how expensive these things really are!!).  However, just holding this lens compared to the kit lens (which I didn't take) was amazing.  This lens feels solid, not heavy, but solid.  By holding it and working the mechanical parts you can really tell it's a well-built piece of work. <br /> <br />Since purchasing this lens I've used it to shoot at parks, family gatherings, theatre events, and even on the track at the Kentucky Derby.  The focus is fast and the range in focal length is fantastic.  I do lighting design for theatre, dance, etc and I needed a lens that would work well in low-light/bright-light conditions equally well.  The 3.5-5.6 aperture works great for this.  Quality is equally good between a dimly lit stage and sitting on the dirt at the derby taking a shot of Street Sense winning. <br /> <br />It's currently the only lens in my arsenal, and it's served me well.  The colors are fantastic and the images are crisp at all lengths.  I've been able to produce some great shots without ever touching them in Photoshop.  I highly recommend this lens to anyone looking to get started in the world of DSLR photography, as well as anyone looking for a quality lens that takes great shots, but doesn't cost an arm and a leg like an L series lens.   <br /> <br />I will say this, it wouldn't hurt to get the lens hood for this model.  I was very happy with it before I got the hood, but the hood really eliminates a great deal of the lens flare and allows for shadows to show up better as well as more color contrast in bright/noon light.  For such a cheap investment, it really has a great impact.  If you're looking for one, the model number is EW-78B II.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This is a truly wonderful CD.  People of all ages can enjoy this kind of beautiful music.  My favorite song is \\"Lost\\".  It's a very moving song, it will give you goosebumps!
0439813786|5.0|Truly huge props should be given to the design team and publishers behind what is surely the years most original and beautifully done book. THe story is simple and sweet, about of a boy named Hugo who lives within the walls of a Paris train station in the lackluster care of his Uncle after his parents die. He is left with a simple automaton ( mechanical man) that his father had been working on before he died. To say much more would be a disservice to the plot, but the real catch with the book, is that probably over seventy percent of the narrative is told in gorgeous pencil on paper drawings by the author, the result being a most unique and wonderful way of telling a story.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|Just a beautiful and informative video.  Not as extensive as the DVD narrated by Sigourney Weaver but some of the most spectacular footage you will ever see.  It is a great gift for those who enjoy nature and photography.
0618680004|5.0|Thank the stars for Mr. Dawkins! I had never bought any of his works before nor read anything by him prior to reading this book and imagine my delight in finding so many of my own thoughts brought out in the written word with far more elegance than I could have produced myself. As Emerson said, &#34;All my best thoughts were stolen by the ancients.&#34; Or was it Pliney?<br /><br />Mr. Dawkins in this books demonsrates himself to be both a formidable  scientist and knowledgable biblical and historical scholar. The heart of the power in his writing lies in striking at the heart of arguments for God and revealing why those arguments fail in execution...time and time again.<br /><br />He begins with usual scientific rigor by fairly listing all the Hypothesis as to why God exists that have been put forward through history, then lists the historical reasoning to support them. If you read no other chapter, you must then read chapter 4 where he refutes the arguments in favor of God's existance one by one. Chapter 4 coupled with his Chapter 8 on the the &#34;Moral Zeitgeist&#34; that could replace religion's stated role of teaching morality are worth the read alone.<br /><br />If so excellent a work can be said to have failings, they are in the weak mentions of other religious systems other than Christian (They are used occassionally, but not with much frequency though he warns us upfront he will do this) and in his arguments for the imperative behind religion and the human capacity/desire to actually have a religious need. In these regions he wanders into philisophical ground with referred, but not argument-clenching logic and data.<br /><br />Still in all, this book is one I would urge believers and atheists to read and add to their libraries. Primarily I urge this because I feel the believers will recognize their own religious failings and come over to the bright side which will improve the world just that little bit more - perhaps forcing them to base their world veiw on reason rather than superstition. For the atheists will empower you with ammunition around those things you have always wished you had excellent words for, but lacked them.the atheists will empower you with ammunition around those things you have always wished you had excellent words for, but lacked them.

B00005JPCF|3.0|This is a great movie with a great message. While it doesn't have the polish and developed humor of a Pixar production (the writers of Happy Feet seem to think that cleverly presented adult/mature humor that is worded in a way that kids will not recognize is just as good as the subtle references and gags that make Pixar flicks so popular with all ages), it's still an enjoyable movie.  <br /> <br />It's a little bit long for most attention spans (I can only take Robin Williams in certain small doses, for instance), but it works for infrequent viewings. However, if your child is like mine and wants to watch the same movie over and over, this is not the best one to have around. It doesn't hold up to frequent viewings like Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc.  <br /> <br />Also, there's something about Elijah Wood that has always bothered me. It did in Lord of the Rings and it does here. Not until I saw Sin City, in which he is silent, did I understand what it was: his voice. If he talked less (or hadn't been cast in the first place) this would be a better movie.
0374105235|5.0|Everyone should read this book. This is the story of Ishmael, a young boy growing up in Sierra Leone, who is caught up in a horrific war and becomes a child soldier. His story captures the essence of his life prior to the war, with glimpses of his family's traditions and affection for each other. This is juxtaposed with the horrors he endures as a child soldier. The language of the book keeps the reader riveted, paints a compelling picture of the realities of a child's life during a brutal war, and depicts the ability of the human spirit to survive the unimaginable. I have not been affected this way by a book in a long, long time. Parts made me laugh, and parts made me cry. It is simply haunting. This is a story we all need to hear.
B000001FSR|3.0|Tom Waits has one sound and is at least consistent for sticking to it.  If you listen to more than one Waits's album, then you have heard it all before.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|First let me just say something because after you read this I'll seem like an anti-linkin park fan when that is NOT THE CASE. Linkin Park has never failed to impress me with their sense of change and ideas. They have a sound like no other that connects to form a masterpiece and leaves you wanting more. So when this cd dropped it had everyone excited because they expected the unexpected but what fans didn't think of is a change in their style. This cd is good but only good. It doesn't hold up to the spotlight of Linkin Park's previous cds. Mainly (in my opinion) because you don't get the collaboration of rap/rock in with their songs. There are two songs which has the rap in them but its just rap and Chester comes in with a little note here and there. Also on one of the songs you can barely make out what the chorus says. This is definitely not an LP great. I'm a big big fan of Linkin Park ever since they graced our musical world with their style but this album disappoints me and it could be that it may just be an album that needs to grow on you but if your looking for another meteora or Hybrid your definitely looking in the wrong place. <br /> <br />3.8 stars Got to give these guys credit they tried something new but I believe they sjhould stick with what works like the saying goes \\"If its not broke don't fix it\\"

B00005JP1C|2.0|\\"The Reaping\\" is produced by Joel Silver's Dark Castle Entertainment, which had made such films as \\"House on the Haunted Hill\\" \\"The 13en Ghosts\\" and \\"House of Wax.\\" For their sixth film, they have chosen religious issues as the theme of the new film, which stars Hilary Swank as Kathleen, former missionary and professor who has to investigate the strange events in the small town of Haven. David Morrissey plays Doug, a science teacher at the local school, Idris Elba as Ben, Kathleen's co-worker and Stephen Rea as Father Costigan, whose warning Kathleen ignores, well, at first. <br /> <br />\\"The strange events\\" or \\"plagues\\" include the river water turning red, or diseases that kill animals, and probably you can guess what follows after them. Like any films from Dark Castle Entertainment, each spooky event is expressed with decent photography and production designs, plus the credible locations of Louisiana.  <br /> <br />For all its merits, however, \\"The Reaping\\" lacks the narrative power that is needed to draw the viewers into the world it describes. The character of Kathleen, who has lost her faith because of a traumatic event, is barely interesting as heroine to whom we relate, and her romantic relations with Doug (which plays an important part in the plot) are not convincing, lacking emotional depths. Though the film shows dark atmosphere, the mysterious events or \\"miracles\\" are not mysterious enough. <br /> <br />The story also involves a little girl named Loren (played by AnnaSophia Robb, impressive in \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\"), who might or might not be responsible for these plagues in the local town. The film gets better in the second part where we meet this mysterious girl Loren, but sadly the film takes too much time to reach there. Actually, Director Stephen Hopkins seems more interested in something else, but not the girl and Miss Robb who should be in the center of the film's story. <br /> <br />I still don't know if I should call \\"The Reaping\\" ahorror film because not many people, I think, would find it scary. That in itself may not be a problem, but it is true that for all its aptly dark atmosphere, the film's suspense fades away too quickly -- as occult thriller, supernatural thriller, or any kind of thriller or drama -- after we come to know where the film leading us to. Many things we will see here, we have seen elsewhere before, perhaps in better films. As to the film's brief and ineffective \\"frog\\" scene, \\"Magnolia\\" did it better.
B00000IL26|5.0|Lee Morgan's The Sidewinder is to jazz trumpet what Sonny Rollins' Saxophone Collosus is to the sax; an absolutely gorgeous work of art that will never leave your your playlist once it works it's way into your head.<br /><br />It only takes one listen to get infected with the rythym.  This is a jazz album that truly rocks, and if you know your roots of rock and roll you'll hear it here, too. Along with Clifford Brown, whom you'll love as well if you dig this recording, Lee Morgan rates among the greatest trumpet players to have ever graced a stage.
B000KCHZK6|2.0|This collection of Norah Jones songs, all written by her (I believe), left much to be desired. The \\"honey-ed\\" voice did not come through clearly, so many of the lyrics were lost or indistinct. If you, like myself, were enchanted by her first efforts and started a collection, you will be sadly disappointed. I have gone back to listening to the bell-like tones of Sarah Brightman and recommend that others choose another favorite artist.
B000MZHW40|4.0|blood diamond is one of the first movies to bring awareness to a great conflict and struggle happening unbenknownst to  americans and people of many other capitalist countries... it is daring and brilliantly filmed my only complaint is the dialogue and predictable circumstances surrounding the main love interests of the story... if an audience is smart enough to get the point of the movie - they deserve better...
B000062YAZ|5.0|Being sort of casual Slayer fan,this is the second of thiers,I have purchased.Seasons In The Abyss,being my first.They are fast becoming one of fave bands.The music is so raw and has great energy.

It will totally kick in your cd player.Go scare your neighbors with the Gods of Thrash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />BTW,I was lucky enough to buy at $13.99 for this import.
0141023384|4.0|As a entertainment novella I wouldn't rate this book too high.  However, this is a culturally diverse book, and I believe it is important enough to say that everybody should read it.  I don't own it, and I probably won't ever read it again, but I am glad that I did, and it certainly is a great book for discussion.  It makes you think about if it is ever justified for one culture to repress the beliefs and practices of another culture. If these sort of philosophical/political/social thoughts and ideas are a passion of yours, or you are interested in classic and culturally important books, definitely read it.
B00005JPCF|3.0|My girls, ages 4 and 8, love this movie and have watched it over and over since they got it as a gift earlier this year.  My girls love to sing. The problem is they have recently been hooked on one song from the movie that I don't care to hear them sing.  It's \\"Let's Talk About Ex\\".  Come on, really now, was it necessary to use that song in a kid's movie?  Don't get me wrong, I, as an adult, love the original Salt-N-Pepa song \\"Let's Talk About Sex\\";  this is the same song without the \\"S\\", it's just ridiculous!!  My 4 year old is wandering around the house singing \\"Let's talk about ex baby, let's talk about you and me, let's talk about ex.\\"  Hopefully they soon tire of it.  My advice...rent it, don't buy it.
B00006JJ51|4.0|Straight Outta Compton is one of the few cd's that changed the way I feel about rap, the cd from start to finish is very good. I listen to Hardcore and other music that is loud and heavy, but there is something about this that I just love!!! buy the cd and you won't regret it!!!
B00006V9A0|5.0|More than any kind of CD's, it's \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections that get the most crap from fans. It only has one unreleased track! My favorite song isn't on here! This song was a hit and it's missing! The list goes on...I believe that any budding fan of Nirvana can start with \\"Nevermind,\\" because it's a great album and can make you a fan. However, if you don't own all the albums, \\"Nirvana\\" is worth getting. It's got the essentials and the underrated ('The Man Who Sold the World'); It's got the previously unreleased \\"You Know You're Right.\\" All the songs are 5-star songs (except \\"Been a Son\\" which is a little incoherent and, sort of, annoying; and \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" which was remixed to suit Kurt's liking, but still isn't that good). The first track, the last song Nirvana ever recorded, is one of the most haunting and painful songs ever recorded. The pain Kurt Cobain expresses in his voice on this track is rivaled only by songs like \\"Lifeless Dead\\" and \\"Down in a Hole\\" sung by Layne Staley. The next three tracks are from their little-heard \\"Bleach\\" album; \\"Sliver\\" and \\"About a Girl\\" are real keepers. Then there's the 4 tracks from \\"Nevermind,\\" which are \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\" and \\"In Bloom\\" and \\"Lithium.\\" I know a way they could've made this a TRULY original Greatest Hits album. They shouldn't have put \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" on the album. Sure, there would've been a public/fan outcry but it would've been a nice little tribute to the memory of Kurt Cobain since he hated that song. Then there's the songs from \\"In Utero,\\" all which are great. One of the strangest songs Nirvana ever recorded and one of my favorite Nirvana songs is \\"Rape Me\\" and I'm glad that's on here. Then the album closes with two songs from the Unplugged album. \\"All Apologies\\" and \\"The Man Who Sold the World,\\" a David Bowie cover. A lot of fans would get mad at me if I said it's the best song Nirvana ever did, so I'll stick with it's my favorite song on the album. I've never heard Bowie's version, but Nirvana's version is great. It doesn't even sound like a live track! It's parallels a little bit of Kurt's life, as well as being a catchy song with a terrific bassline and guitar hook. Fans will always complain about this album and, unless you're a completist, if you have all the Nirvana albums...This one isn't necessary. However, if you're looking to get into Nirvana this CD is worth checking out. <br /> <br />GRADE: A
B000000W5H|4.0|Just another solid effort from the Stones with the rockers and ballads.The latest album from them,that I have decided to add to my collection.The classics and the not-so-familiar ones.It has the classics,If You Can't Rock Me,Ain't Too Proud To Beg & It's Only R N R. I have discovered some new ones too.Mainly hearing them from alternate radio.Those are Till The Next Goodbye,Dance Little Sister and If You Really Want To be My Friend,the latter,being my newest discovery.If you want to discover new classics,perhaps this album may be the one for you.it was for me.If you are a Stones fanatic,you probably know them.If you are casual,you will make a major discovery.Buy it and you will not regret it....
B000M5B6Q0|3.0|Although the music included on this CD is enjoyable, the disc is woefully short in length.  The soundtrack clocks in at just under 39 minutes which, by today's standards, is very short.  There was much more music in the film that could, and should, have been included on the CD.  For instance, where are the \\"music and lyrics\\" to the two great songs prominently used in the movie's closing credits? America's \\"Work To Do\\" from their latest album \\"Here and Now\\", and another Haley Bennett tune entitled \\"Invincible\\" are glaring omissions on this disc.  The consumer got seriously short-changed on this one.

B0001ADAVK|4.0|\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is a romantic-comedy that is more likely to appeal to women than men, but is nevertheless charming, funny, and entertaining. The movie doesn't have the same rom-com mood that movies like \\"Failure to Launch\\" and \\"Must Love Dogs\\" share, but instead shares a closer bond with films like \\"The Cider House Rules\\" sans the depressing aspect. The movie is essentially a star vehicle for Julia Roberts, but her female co-stars Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Julia Stiles, and Ginnifer Goodwin all steal the show from her.  <br /> <br />Roberts plays Katherine Watson, a teacher from California who lands a job at the prestigious Wellesley school. The film takes place in the '50s where women went to school not to go on to get successful jobs but merely to bridge the gap between school and marriage. She's the teacher of art history and upon her arrival meets a number of rebelling and strong-willed young females, including the hateful Betty (Dunst), the free-spirited Giselle (Gyllenhaal), and the optimistic Joan (Stiles)...As Katherine adjusts to her new job and it's strict rules, she finds herself falling for a womanizing Italian teacher (Dominic West) and that's pretty much all the plot you're going to get from this film.  <br /> <br />The movie is one of those films that relies heavily on the charm of its actors to keep the film moving and it works. All the actors are fascinating to watch and all the actresses I mentioned above steal the show from Roberts. \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" isn't a fantastic film, but it's definitely worth watching. <br /> <br />GRADE: B+
B00008WT5C|5.0|With AC/DC,Rock will always be there.This album being the latest addition to my collection.The 4th with Bon,in my collection. May I say,Bon was the Best!!!!!! With all respect to Brian Johnson ,who led sang on perhaps,one of my fave albums of all time,Back In Black.Bon just sang with the rawest energy ever,in my opinion. This album just had the rockenest rockers ever.Starting off with \\"Go Down\\",which has so much energy.Than going into \\"Dog eat Dog\\",\\"Let There Be Rock\\",\\"Bad Boy Boogie\\",\\"Problem Child\\"(of course,it was on Dirty Deeds too),through the last \\"Whole Lott Rosie\\".This album just has so much energy  and will rock your socks off!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Bon and AC/DC forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1594200823|3.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma starts out as a fascinating read thanks to Pollan's engaging writing style. The book is broken down into three sections consisting of four meals. Pollan looks at how each of the four different meals arrived on his plate.<br /><br />The first section details the use of corn to feed America and explores how a typical fast food meal from McDonald's is comprised primarily of corn. For example, not only are 13 of the 38 chicken mcnuggets' ingredients from corn, but the chickens themselves were raised on corn. In addition, the burger he's eating came from a steer that was fed corn; his family's beverages are largely derived from corn, as well. In this section, he notes that most of the farm land is used to produce food to feed to livestock. Worse, the corn is largely produced using petroleum products: fertilizers, pesticides, transportation fuel, and plastic packaging.<br /><br />Pollan's next meal is one prepared from the organic offerings at Whole Foods.  Here he eats an organic chicken that, he learns when he visits the farm that produced it, never saw the light of day and was raised no differently from a non-organic chicken, except that the feed was organic.  Apparently, the chickens are not given access to the outside for the first few weeks of life.  After this time, a door leading to a small, fenced area is opened.  By this time, the chickens are habituated to staying inside, and they never venture out; the farmers hope to keep it that way, as they would be concerned if any chicken ever did wander out. The bag of organic salad greens shipped from California to the East coast use more energy in production and transport than the bag's contents yield (this underscores the importance of buying local produce, but the chicken was no better in this respect).<br /><br />The third meal is one experienced on Joe Salatin's Virginia farm (Polyface). Salatin's farm is seen as environmentally friendly.  There is no soil erosion, and the land is fertile and healthy.  When Pollan sits down to meals here, he cites the farm as the sole source for all of the food.  However, a glaring omission in this section is his failure to factor in the transported feed for the chickens (80% of their calories) purchased by Salatin's farm.<br /><br />The final meal is one that was supposed to consist of foods gathered or hunted by Pollan.  He allowed himself a number of exceptions, though. Pollan forages for mushrooms, picks fruit from a local tree, and hunts wild pigs. The meal would have been rather sparse if not for his numerous exceptions; his experiences were, none the less, interesting.<br /><br />Also in the final section, Pollan half-heartedly attempts vegetarianism, an attempt that proved to be nothing more than a waste of pages.  He complained that it was too difficult and that he felt he was imposing on hosts just by being one. If he really had a problem with that, he could have at least tried to be a flexitarian and only eaten meat when he was a guest who didn't want to impose.  His omnivorous agenda is obvious in this section.<br /><br />In several sections of the book, Pollan wants to ignore his disgust so he can eat certain things.  In the foraging section, he makes a point to state that we need to listen to our taste buds, as they have helped us avoid toxic foods, yet he wants to get over his disgust so he can eat a pig, which he hunted, and chickens, which he slaughtered.  He fails to realize mental disgust is just as important as taste.<br /><br />Another of Pollan's glaring errors is his allegation that we would need to clear MORE land if we all went vegetarian.  Huh?  Did he forget his own information in the section on corn?  Most of it is fed to animals, yielding a small return for the corn investment.  We would use LESS land if we ate the plants directly.  He uses ratios of corn calories to grass-fed cattle per acre for his fuzzy math to declare grass-fed cattle as the most efficient use of agricultural land, but he doesn't look at other greens that grow as efficiently as grass as a possibility for human consumption. Plus, his equation is based on his experience at Salatin's farm, where he never factored in the chicken feed.<br /><br />Overall, the book is worth a read if for nothing more than the first section on corn.  The second and third parts have useful information interspersed with his errors, and the emphasis on problems with non-local foods is good for everyone.ultural land, but he doesn't look at other greens that grow as efficiently as grass as a possibility for human consumption.

1582701709|5.0|I am a big fan of the DVD so I bought a copy of the book and found it even better because I go to the exact section I want to re-read. It gives you something to contemplate and meditate on. I highly recommend it to people (and I do recommend it to many people). The things techniques I learned have helped me land a major book publishing deal with Warner Books, received a movie offer on my novel and have given me peace of mind so that I'm focused on the good instead of worrying about how I'm going to get there.

B000002IAS|5.0|I originally bought this album when it first came out.  I knew nothing about the record.  I'd been a Cream and Blind Faith fan and seeing Eric Clapton's name on the cover caught my eye.  I also loved the back and front of the album cover.  I got it home and put the needle on the thing and went WOW!  It had everything that Rock N'Roll is about.  No one knew at that time that we were listing to the birth of Derek and The Dominoes.  Bonnie Bramlett's voice is blistering and sweet at the same time.  For the next 30 years I could still hear her in my brain saying \\"Hey would you give us some red lights, 'cause this is a red light song\\".  The album's still in the stack on the top shelf of my closet.  I saw it on Amazon and it was time again for \\"Goin' Home\\" and \\"That's What My Man Is For\\".  Order it for yourself.  It's rock n' roll 101 taught by finest professor's in rock academia.

B0002KVULG|2.0|makes this movie tolerable to watch.  This version of Bram's classic omits Arthur Holmwood (Lucy's fiancé and a friend to the rest of the vampire slaying crew) as well as Quincey Morris, (American from Texas) both important and significant roles in Stoker's version.  Why are these roles important? Because beyond being the beginning and foundation of modern-day vampire characteristics (Before Stoker's Dracula there were a number of legends and myths - Stoker did the research, decided on characterists/abilities, and most vampire stories are now based on his rendition) Stoker's Dracula deals with issues of colonialism, sexuality, and western culture verses eastern culture (England, the United States, and Denmark vs. 'Transylvania' Eastern Europe and Persia) This 1979 film version rewrites the story to completely obliterate Stoker's plot, full of complications extending beyond a simple scary story.   <br /> <br />However, the acting is good and the special effects are wonderful.  The change of time period doesn't strike me as a particularly good choice.  Also, the story takes place in London, but this version hardly recognizes it.  In the book, Dracula's new London home is not on an island.  In the movie, his new home looks like it was moved from Transylvania, which disrupts the idea that Dracula tries to bring Eastern European 'otherness' to England.   <br /> <br />If you haven't read the book and just love vampire movies, this one isn't bad.  If you have read the book, or enjoy reading into movies, this one isn't anything special.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I have been waiting the 3rd Linkin Park album as many other fans for so long. But after listening it for the first time, I got really dissapointed. I can say that is the first time I bought an album and only liked about 2 or 3 songs. The rest of the album sounds all the same boring stuff. <br />They for sure have credit for trying something different, but for the next one, they should try to do an album with much more variety. <br />Also, for some reason I don't like the sewaring in this album. Nothing against it, I listen bands like Nine Inch Nails, Garbage or Green Day that make it sound good in their respective albums, but for some reason I don't think it sound really good in a Linkin Park album.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I, also, at first, was not pleased with the new version of P&P, as no movie can be any more perfect that the BBC version, starring Colin Firth. After having seen that one, this one seems so rushed (after all, it's only 1/3 as long) but the lead actors, Kiera Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen give their characters a bit different twist. Elizabeth is not as starched, while Mr Darcy is even more sensuous. Definitely more passionate. There is just ONE flaw to this movie (other than the fact it should have gone on forever!). Someone should have fired the hairdresser!! I mean look at Mr Bingley! Even Mr. Darcy's looked a bit too \\"wirey\\" at times. Yes, nice wet though!!
0060512806|5.0|+Had read little science fiction. <br />+Knew nothing about cryptography. <br />+Lost my math aptitude somewhere between trig & calculus. <br />+Was too late for baby booming and too early for on-line gaming.   <br />+And my image of a \\"cyberpunk\\" was a bald-headed-by-choice, multiple tattooed, vampire-skinned, ninja-attituded computer super-genius who would laugh at my slow-brained, old-fashioned approach to the world. <br /> <br />But my father served in WWII ... and I was intrigued by code breaking.  So when a friend recommended a book with a name so hard to pronounce I made her write it down and with pages of War & Peace like numbers, I decided it was worth a try.  I'm still amazed I did. <br /> <br />And I am equally thankful as Cryptonomicon (a name that now rolls off my tongue) is in my top ten favorite books.  I bought one copy as a gift, and gave my own cherished copy to a friend b/c I didn't want him to chance not getting around to buying it.   <br /> <br />Though oft' overstated in reviews (yet before stated not at all by me) I find Cryptonomicon a modern piece of literature, essential especially for the male reader between the ages of 20 and 50.  (No letters please - as indeed it was a woman who originally passed the book on to me).  But past the testosterone -satisfying war story, the non-stop action thriller and the intellectual pleasure of learning about (and pretending to understand)the world of cyber technology, I found myself touched by this thought: had I been a contemporary of my teenage father during WWII ... or were my future son my contemporary today ... we would have been life-long friends. <br /> <br />It's not an easy read as the cyberpunk language is as difficult to follow as is understanding the genius of the \\"original\\" code makers and breakers of the 1930s & '40's.  And the stores jump (pre-Da Vinci Code) back and forth between World War II and modern day.  But I loved both trying to follow the math and yielding my respect to those who could.  And as much as I hated leaving off one time period's story at chapter's end, one page later I would be reminded that it was THIS time period's tale I most enjoyed.   <br /> <br />And so: <br /> <br />If you are a cyber punk, my apologies for past ignorance.   <br /> <br />If you love a good adventure with intrigue, mystery, sex, math puzzles (understandable and not), codes (solvable and not), then you'll be trilled that this book lasts for as many pages as it does.   <br /> <br />If you are a father or a son, this may touch you in ways that may surprise you.  <br /> <br />And as for me, I no longer think in terms of generation gaps, for after reading Cryptonomicon I have decided that the only differences between Generations X or Y and with The Greatest Generation ... are smaller chips and a larger acceptance of respect for information.   <br />

B000BZISTO|3.0|I don't know the meaning of the word, \\"post-modern\\", but I like the fact that its abbreviation (Pomo) looks an awful lot like Porno.   <br />I bought the DVD for a much closer look at Joss Whedon's uncredited dialogue and came away with a new awareness of the film's plot holes and irrational construction, most of which are pointed out (nearly celebrated) by Graham Yost and Mark Gordon on the second commentary. <br />It's that commentary track that makes this purchase valuable to me, beyond the very interesting camera operation and the peculiarities of story.   <br />Yost and Gordon self-dissect this film in ways that illustrate the processes and creative decisions that lead an action-audience to a desired end, which is also an adequate working definition of pornography. <br />Curiously, even after the post-mortem, Speed still thrills.  Go figure.
B000026C3T|4.0|The songs are great.  No question about it.  However, I happened to be sitting next to the right speaker of my stereo system when Immigrant Song began and I noticed the sound from the right speaker sounded a bit choppy.  At first I thought the problem was with the balance control on my receiver, but I then played the CD on my PC and noticed the same problem.   (Has anyone else noticed this on their CD?)  I checked Atlantic Record's web site for an email address to ask if this was a known problem or if it could just be my CD.  While on Atlantic's site I noticed that the art work for \\"Led Zeppelin Remasters\\" did not match the artwork on the \\"Led Zeppelin Remasters\\" sold on Amazon.  The order of the songs is also different.  Furthermore, the album on the Atlantic site that has the same artwork as the \\"Led Zeppelin Remasters\\" sold on Amazon is a 4-CD set, not a 2-CD set.  Apparently they package the CDs differently in different countries.  Maybe I'm just biased/suspicous, but I sort of suspect the sound quality problem might be due to the fact that the CD is an import.  I could be wrong about that, but... I think the next time I purchase CDs on Amazon I will avoid ones listed as \\"Import\\".  I could be wrong about that

1563890119|5.0|Many of you out there, who have grown with comic-books, remember \\"good ol' days\\" of linear storytelling and straight-forward art, without much complications. All it mattered was, whether the hero will save the world (and almost always he would), and will he get the girl in the end (well, this one was a bit unpredictable). But then some day, we woke up, and found things changed. There were no conventional heroes anymore. Stories needed great ammount of knowledge that you had to acquire sometimes earlier. If ou didn't, you would find yourself forever lagging behind, whilst comic book universes moved with great spead to some distant and unkonwn future.<br /><br />And this was good.<br /><br />Finally, something happened, that pulled comics from pulp-fiction and five cents fun that lasted for one afternoon, destined to be never looked upon again. Or is it that we just grew up? I cannot tell for sure, and I doubt that any of you can. But, new form of art emerged and we had to deal with that.<br /><br />Now, that being said, if you are new to world of comic books, Sandman series isn't the one you should begin with. It's complexity, strange perspectives and editing of slides tends to divert people that throw a casual glance on printed papers. When you see something that shows itself as total chaos, somehow you doub't the whole \\"artistic value\\".<br /><br />To really enjoy Sandman, you'll have to be able to drown yourself into a world so utterly stragne but yet so close to this one in which our lives are lead. You'll have to use your head and imagination (and finally, the knowledge) to fill in the gaps in storytelling that are left unfilled on purpose. This can be tiresome to someone not used to (or used to much) to conventional storytelling in comic books. But, that trouble is worth it's gains.<br /><br />So if you are still interested, you'll be entering the world of Dream, world of Morpheus which suffered destruction and needs rebuilding...

B000005DQR|4.0|What I like about DJ Shadow's album \\"Entroducing...\\" is that his music blends in the music of jazz & hip hop. It seems like everytime I'm listening to this album, I'm always driving, stuck in traffic on I-75/85. So to help pass the time, I always drop a rhyme to some of the beats on here. And I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I'm pretty good at it. For all you rappers/lyricists out there, don't tell me \\"Why Hip Hop Sucks in '96\\" doesn't make you start flowing. \\"What Does Your Soul Look Like\\" is another song to get at.<br /><br />DJ Shadow really shows the art of turntablism and blending vinyl records and sampling (and I mean at it's best). You really have to understand the type of sound that he is trying to create on every track, and it flows real nice. Most of the track vibe real well, something that a lot of instrumental tracks don't have that much, if at all. \\"Building Steam With A Grain Of Salt\\" is one of the tracks that flow so easily<br /><br />There were some tracks that I weren't feeling too much. \\"The Number Song\\" really didn't stand out to me because of it's high energy and high live sounding effect. Also, I personally thought some of the songs were a minute too long (mostly those two song in one track songs). At a point, I was like, \\"Damn, how long is this song???\\". Also I'm mad that \\"Why Hip Hop Sucks In '96\\" is only 35 seconds long. In my opinion, that is one of the best beats on the album. But thats all the bad things I can think of.<br /><br />\\"Entroducing...\\" is one of the best instrumental tracks you'll hear. At a time in '96 when hip hop was changing, this would have been a breath of fresh air to hear (espically when people were starting to loose their origonality). This album blows [[ASIN:B000HCO8IG The Outsider]] as well as [[ASIN:B000BRONYQ Funky Skunk]] away. There are no vocals on here, except for the samples. This is just pure music to vibe to real easily. Whether if you're driving in traffic, or chillin' in your bed, or if your preference is jazz, or hip hop, this is one album that you will enjoy.

B00006JJ2Y|5.0|I have been a Lou Reed fan since the early seventies, and in my opinion his best solo albums are Transformer, Berlin, Street Hassle and Take No Prisoners. That's right, I rate TOP among Lou's best recordings. I think the performances are excellent, examples being the jazzy version of I Wanna Be Black, a moving, powerful version of Coney Island Baby and the masterful delivery of Street Hassle. The way Sweet Jane kicks in at the beginning of the album is priceless. The singing is among the best of all his recordings. While the album doesn't necessarily grab a hold of you immediately, repeated listens reveal Lou at his sleazy, street-wise best.
0790729407|4.0|The '96 release of `Michael Collins' chronicles the life and death of the famous, or infamous depending on your perspective, of the Irish freedom fighter Michael Collins. I can't vouch for the historicity of the events chronicled in this film since I know very little about the early years of the IRA, I can only judge it for its entertainment value and message.<br /><br />First, the cast is excellent with the likes of; Liam Neeson (as Michael Collins), Aidan Quinn, Alan Rickman, Stephen Rea and Julia Roberts. There's even a short appearance at the end of the film by Jonathan Rhys Meyers. With such a cast in place it's no wonder that the acting superior and highly believable. The storyline is also superior and perfectly captures the angst of a country in turmoil. It clearly and expertly shows that the problem is not simply black and white, England versus Ireland. This multi-faceted and layered plot also explores the divided loyalties and passions of a people in search of a cohesive vision of freedom.<br /><br />Factual or not `Michael Collins' is a stirring and emotional story that explores a form of warfare that is essential to understand in today's world, giving some clarification to the all important question, \\"Who is the patriot and who is the terrorist?
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a must see DVD for all ages.  It should be required viewing in schools and businesses to make more people aware of the beauty of the earth and the danger it is in.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Edward Norton has never dissapointed me, but this is his best.  Giamatti is also great. Good script, sets, costumes.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|An excellent dark, man on the brink of extinction, type film which you don't really understand why until you watch the documentary that's available in it's \\"special features\\" option.  The documentary puts this world at this level of despair thanks to man's neglect to recognize \\"global warming\\".  The film was almost miserable to watch but I'm glad that I saw it.  I see it as a plausible warning about our future destination rather than just to be entertained.  The camera work was really good.  Almost like how Stanley Kubrick put a greater emphasis to a scene.  People walking towards or away from the camera as the cameraman follows the person so you would see that person's horrific surroundings as he passes through it.  Visual destruction was everywhere.  So this film was definitely visually stunning.<br /><br />I never thought that I would ever see and hear the classic song \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" put to a movie.  What shocked me was when that song came on,  I thought that my CD player just kicked on for no reason because I did, in fact, have King Crimson's CD in my CD player at that time.<br /><br />And did anyone else notice one scene at the window where you saw a balloon of a \\"pig\\", and the old pollution spewing chimneys of that classic old factory that was used on the \\"Animals\\" album from Pink Floyd?  Perhaps this is one clue put in about \\"global warming\\".  I wonder if there are other unique references to our past that is used here in a future about 20 years from now.  The music in this film was all just a bunch of music from their past.  I wonder if that was meant to say that all the musicians of the world are already succumbed to extinction so the only music that's known and heard is all so old.  That's something to ponder.<br /><br />I think I need to watch this again.  Now I'm curious to know if I've missed anything else in the backgrounds of each scene.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|This is a great disc. Never heard of Paolo before listening to this and now I am addicted.  Since purchasing this cd I have been hearing him everywhere.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the longer, BBC version that the Discovery Channel broadcast was adapted from.  It's worth having the full version, plus there are so many extras.  I am not fond of the \\"circle of life\\" or \\"food chain\\" scenes, if you know what I mean, but there are so many other stirring and amazing images that are truly unforgettable.  It's far too much to get through in one sitting, but you will find yourself watching it over and over again for years to come.
B00005U8EM|5.0|One of Bill Murrays best. Great Harold Ramis direction. One for the collector's shelf
B0001YRVN4|5.0|This Trilogy was a great buy.  The product is of good quality and in great conditions.  the delivery was fast.  Would definitely do business again with this seller.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the most fantastically photographed series ever.  I kept saying...I've never seen that before.  I recommend this highly.  I just wish the blu-ray, HD fight was over so I could buy a player and have this in HD.  I bought this non-hd version after watching it in HD on DSCHD. <br /> <br />DO NOT HESITATE; BUY IT NOW, you won't be disappointed.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I hate to say it but after hearing this album I gotta wonder if there's some beef going on between some of the members in LP. The rap is definitely toned down to a minimal (It's like he didn't even want much of anything to do with the album at all) and most of the songs are slow and boring.  <br /> <br />There's pretty much one song that the two singers actually come together on and you ALMOST get the old LP feeling with it but for some crazy reason they decided to tone down most of the guitar and trade what would normally be a rockin chorus into a toned-down,  no-distortion mess with an audience clapping in the background. <br /> <br />There are still some pretty good songs to crank up here and there. Fortunately Chester decided not to let the album go completely to hell. Check out What I've Done, No More Sorrow, and my favorite: Given Up. Even with these songs you sit there and think \\"Wow these would have been even better with some rap incorporated in them\\" but hey, it's the \\"new sound\\" right? As for the slow jams- I'll leave you to judge. I've been too pissed off with disappointment to pick out the good ones yet. <br /> <br />Bottom line: If a band makes an album they need to do it together. It sounds like everyone wanted to do their own thing on this CD. I hope they settle their differences for the next album.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Can't say enought about this purchase.  My favorite show...still need season two.
B000NVIXFK|1.0|Most of this album is an exercise in musical motonony.  The radio-oriented opener, along with tracks 2 and 5, are the only songs you'll probably want to hear more than once. <br /> <br />Even the instrumentals amble about pointlessly - a fact that not long ago seemed metaphysically impossible.  For the first time in human history terms like \\"Rush instrumental\\" and \\"musical mediocrity\\" are not necessarily universe-collapsing inverses. <br /> <br />In the 70's their \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" took its audience through a journey at first interesting, then cathartic, and finally funny.  In the 1980's \\"YYZ\\" thrust musical jujitsu upon its victims' ears.  In the 90's \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\" proved prog rock too can be gorgeous and captivating.  Alas, the instrumentals on Snakes and Arrows (and yes, I'm including the 12 string guitar piece) are as forgettable as they are lyricless. <br /> <br />S & A sounds like stuff Rush threw out when making Vapor Trails, a vastly superior effort (and still far from their best work). <br /> <br />.. ..
0060974176|4.0|Lean production started with Henry Ford's car for the masses. Toyota took the old idea of customization combined with mass production to create their mass customization model. Quality is important in the product and focus on what is important to the client allows us to know what qualities make the most difference.\\"If it aint broke don't fix it.\\" Providing an affordable product was 20th century sales. Improving the improvements that are critically important to the client is 21st century marketing. The book proves it through the automotive manufacturing model.
B000AA305M|5.0|Enjoyed the passion of the songs and the powerful music.  Lyrics are interesting.  What David writes about his lyrics and his new style of music was interesting.  Just a good, emotionally moving, but mellow compilation of songs that may cause you to pause and think. <br /> <br />Seeing the lyrics were helpful, because his enunciation is not good at all times.  I fell asleep while watching TV and the title song \\"Life in Slow Motion\\" was playing on an \\"ER\\" episode and the melody and passion behind the lyrics awoke me from my sleep.
0671027344|5.0|My friend had lent me this book a while back, and I finally picked it up on a day I was sick and home from school. It captured my attention from the very beginning. I finished it that day. I strongly recommend that you get your own copy, because you will be reading it again. <br /> <br />It may be an MTV book, but that does not take away from its quality at all. Pick it up, read the first sentence, and you'll end up not wanting to put it down.
0374105235|5.0|I read this book for a memoir project I am doing for my AP Language class and I was blown away by how Ishmael really gets into your heart through his writing. He does such a great job of expressing his feelings and experiences during his time as a boy soldier in Sierra Leone. Defenitely a must read.
0374105235|5.0|I loved this memoir. What a wonderful writer Ishmael Beah is. I recommend that every American read this book so that they can realize how lucky we are to live in a free Country. How sad it is to see all these young boys with bright and happy futures taken into the army, and killing other little boys just like themselves. Not only is this a real story of what its like to live in in war but what its like to kill others.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This film absolutely broke my heart. The soundtrack includes some of the most compelling and beautiful music I have ever heard, and contrary to some of the other reviewers, I never thought that Gerard Butler's voice was inappropriate for this role. The lavish sets and costuming combined with the gorgeous soundtrack, a tragic, heartwrenching love story, and an incredibly attractive, sensual, brooding anti-hero make this movie absolutely worth while.
B000O599WG|5.0|Dear China Smith, no one is forcing you to upgrade your mono sound, faded color, pan/scan single disk of RIO BRAVO.  But I, for one, welcome the chance to purchase a newly-remastered sight and sound edition of this great Howard Hawks western, with commentary by admirers John Carpenter and Richard Schickel, Schickel's brilliant 1973 documentary, a John Wayne trailer gallery, and especially two brand-new documentaries in appreciation of the movie.  RIO BRAVO is a masterpiece that is getting the crown jewels treatment for only $16 from Amazon.  It deserves a serious review by you on none at all.  And there are also those who are willing to spend even more to get a pressbook, a comic book, and more.  I will settle for the $16 two-disk set and am excited about upgrading my old copy.  Consider it an inexpensive variation on the car lover who has to have the newest model every five years. <br /> <br />Steve Wood
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Megadeth is back yet again, and is stronger then ever, with amazing guitar, lyrics, and themes. Not only has Megadeth brought back some awesome Heavy Metal, but they also brough Vic Rattlehead along with them, and this time around he's got skin. The inside of the book has alot of the new Vic, and it's awesome. It's amazing that after 20 years of writing and playing, Dave and the rest of Deth is still going this strong, producing this much stuff. I used to think that Megadeth held a distant second to Metallica, but after Metallica's St. Anger and Megadeth's United Abominations, Deth is deffinatly catching up. If Metallica releases another joke of an album like St. Anger, and Megadeth releases something even close to this, Megadeth will be on the same level as Metallica. This album show's Megadeth at it's best, amazing guitar and lyrics with songs like \\"Sleepwalker\\" and \\"Washington is Next!\\", this is a must have album. \m/ Rock on Death! Keep it Up! \m/
B00006ZXSK|5.0|To wonderful for words! Had the VHS and ran it into the ground. Way better on DVD! Just a great feel good movie, that makes you want to cheer at the end for all women who belive in themselves. Much more than a rental, a definate keeper!
B000O75F7C|5.0|i heard deadwing which is the more rocking heavy album. i heard in absentia which is long and more soft. both are spacey. foabp is short but not a dull moment in the album for me. deadwing is good for people who like to rock but i like to chill. in absentia should be right up my alley right? well, its kinda boring at times. maybe too many songs. <br />this one has the right mix for me. enough rock with melodic stuff. <br />i will be getting the 5.1 advanced resolution supposedly coming in sept. <br />this album is great.
B0001CNRB6|4.0|Doris Day-Rock Hudson romcom Lover Come Back reworks aspects of Pillow Talk in a plot that sees them as rival advertising execs fighting over the account for a non-existent product in a surprisingly and engagingly smutty satire that goes out of its way to mock the void between the two stars screen images and reality. Rock Hudson seems heroically determined to invite rumors by pretending to be unsure of his sexuality (\\"Just because you can light a stove doesn't mean you can cook\\") and even creeping back into his apartment wearing nothing more than a woman's fur coat (\\"He's the last guy I would have figured...\\" notes one onlooker) while a somewhat sidelined Doris Day gets married as she's rushed into the delivery room. Along the way Tony Randall practically invents both of the Crane brothers and sets up about three seasons worth of plots for Frasier as his neurotic boss. Great fun.
B000IU3XTW|3.0|OK, I love the Foo Fighters, They're my favorite band to see live.  This is an acoustic album...somehow I missed that in the item description.  I  like it a lot, it hits you in a different way than the normal rockin blarin Foo Fighters that I love.  But it hits you none the less...
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Love Actually is a mixed bag set in that mythical London that only seems to exist in the imagination of Richard Curtis. As a director, Curtis gets poor performances out of the better actors (Neeson and Rickman in particular) and passable ones from the really bad ones (Keira Knightley, Martin Freeman, Sienna Guillory) but is generally best when leaving the others to do their regular schtick (Hugh Grant playing the world's least convincing British Prime Minister, Emma Thompson in a virtual reprise of her Tall Guy character and Colin Firth doing his usual constipated look routine). With such a large ensemble many get lost en route and too many of the stories go nowhere, but it does get there in the end despite your resistance. Some of the surprisingly strong deleted scenes on the DVD do hint at a much more ambitious film, and there is one remarkably effective moment with a shattered Thompson listening to a Joni Mitchell song that holds the moment longer than you'd think he'd dare, but in the end the temptation to give in to feelgood corn wins over, even if it is at the cost of the film's already very limited supply of credibility. But that kid does look like he should be in The Omen or Village of the Damned - every time I see him I keep on expecting him to say \\"You are thinking of a brick wall.\\" <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love it!  I recently saw the traveling production of Wicked and relive it each time I listen to the soundtrack.  A must have for any Wicked fan.
B000F48D3C|4.0|Having served, I appreciated the reality with which Black Hawk Down was presented. For example, the Ranger falling to his death because he missed the repelling rope as the helicopter maneuvers to avoid enemy fire demonstrates an unavoidable mishap. For me this movie reveals some of the subtle and rarely talked about realities soldiers face. It also showcases some of the overlooked political realities.  For instance, conflict is conflict; but real combat is a major advantage for real life guerilla fighters. Yes, our soldiers are well trained, but nothing prepares a soldier for combat like combat. Our soldiers do not have the opportunity to fight as much as militia fighters from other countries, yet we are always fighting battles in our enemy's backyard. This creates a disadvantage for our soldiers and usually hurts our militaries reputation. And we ALWAYS underestimate the tenacity of third world guerilla fighters until, of course, they kill one of our soldiers. This arrogant American mentality puts our soldiers at a distinct disadvantage. In one of the scenes the Ranger commander disagrees with the Delta Forces  Non-Commissioned Officer In Charge (NCOIC) and subsequently reprimands him by telling him, \\"you are combat ineffective soldier!,\\" for disobeying his directive in front of his subordinates. This may have been the most realistic depiction in the entire movie. Anyone who's been in the Army knows that Delta Force soldiers are on an elite level rarely seen in any military setting and if you want to live you should put your ego aside and listen to them. It's not that I recommend or condone disobeying orders, because I don't. But if it means saving our guys lives, I think egos should be set aside during stressful situations. The narcissistic infighting of arrogant leadership may be the military's most lethal killer....of American troops! And don't get me started on the misplaced arrogance of 90% of the E-9's in the Army. Ironically, one of the most pronounced differences between the experienced and not so experienced combat soldier, is the level of compassion with which they approach life. Those soldiers that have experienced combat shy away from bravado, while those that haven't seen war seek the glory of the stereotypical brave man. This overlooked aspect of military life is rarely exposed. The U.S. will always be called upon to help other nations with their political mishaps. And don't discount the difficulties NATO Forces have communicating with each other. But at some point we're going to have to learn to be painfully selective.  Don't we owe it to the parents of the young men and women who are, were and will be killed or maimed, to produce tangible results from these skeptical overseas missions? It's condescending to downplay the patriotism of the families of our nation's fallen soldiers by casually selecting insignificant international political targets. Black Hawk Down not only successfully salutes the soldiers involved in the Somalia experience with its authenticity, it succeeds in showing the audience the always ugly and chaotic circumstances our soldiers face while in the exercise of heated international conflict.rences between the experienced and not so experienced combat soldier, is the level of compassion with which they approach life.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|We all waited a long 3 years for the follow up album to Meteora. While this album knocks it out of its album sleeve it still does not sit next to their freshman album Hybrid Theory that brought the Linkin Park genre main stream. <br /> <br />The first few tracks are very hardcore to the average LP listener, but as the album goes on we find the sound that made us fall in love with LP from the start. The melodic sounds of Shinoda rapping and Chester screaming really bring you back to the first album a la Crawling and In The End. <br /> <br />The album ends on a sad note. I wish they were able to end it on a classic style LP style song but alas this can not be. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I am happy overall with the outcome of their new non-remix album. This should keep us busy for the next couple of years. <br />Thanks Linkin Park! <br />4 Stars!
B000BTJDGC|4.0|With a title like The Exorcism of Emily Rose, what do you think most of us expected to see? Well of course we did! With a title like that! What were we supposed to think? Although this wasn't the masterpiece The Exorcist became, it was definitely a good movie. First of all, it wasn't a horror film, it was a suspense film. And second, this movie was taken from true life events. Whether you believe or not, if your child experienced what Emily, played be Jennifer Carpenter, supposedly experienced, you'd certainly wonder. For instance, you might wonder as to the true validity of our collective spiritual imagination (God and Lucifer, Heaven and Hell, possession etc). In any event, The Exorcism of Emily Rose succeeds in delivering a taut, clever, and simmering investigation into the supernatural that many of us would rather avoid. Tom Wilkinson, Laura Linney and Campbell Scott are all masters of the subtle performance, which is a perfect compliment to this film. And their performances are so unselfish and revealing that you are completely blindsided by the films conclusion.  But there is a caveat! This is not a message movie. While it is controversial subject matter, it's meant to provide entertainment and nothing more. Pop it in and enjoy!
0380778556|5.0|Wow, what a wonderfully suspenseful story. Daphne Du Maurier writing was so engaging, I couldn't put the book down. Her style of writing was magnificant. Never knowing Mrs. de Winter's first name, to describing Manderly as if you were there. I must say, I really didn't like the way it ended, but over all, excellent book.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Anne Rice created the modern vampire with her novel, and the movie did it justice. Brad Pitt is definitely what makes the movie, he plays the role of the depressed vampire Louis perfectly. This the movie also has the very young Kirsten Dunst playing the role of Claudia, and she is an amazing actress for one her age at the time. The overall film is just perfect, from location to wardrobe, it feels like a trip through time. It's just a shame that the second movie wasn't as good as this movie. The movie \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" will go down in movie history as a classic and won't be forgotten any time soon if ever.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is a great dvd, and you can vatch it uncompressed in hd-dvd. I will be using this as reference material....the video and sound is that good. No reason to discuss the content...it is the series that ran on the discovery. I speaks for itself. <br />Enjoy

B000M39SYE|1.0|To call something this biased a documentary is appalling.  This movie is so poorly done it discredits everything Michael Moore is attempting to acheive.
B00006AW2M|5.0|This is definately a mind expanding album.  Although, it was criticized by the media of the era, their is nothing short of brilliance here.  The Citadel is very heavy.  She's a Rainbow is the most popular from this, but I think 2000 light years from home is their most flavorfull cut.  It is very athereal.  Jaggers' vocals give a great spatialness.  I would recommend this cd to people who either don't like, or don't know the Stones.  It is one of those cds that will balance your listening pleasures.

B00005JPFH|4.0|Last night I went to see the Spiderman Premier and loved it! The series isn't losing momentum as sequels are produced, and I daresay the plot and dialogue are at least as good as either the first two movies as well as being far superior as far as the special effects go. Thomas Haden Church did a great job as Sandman, although I thought that Topher Grace was somewhat lacking as Venom. I thought the director did a great job handling several somewhat complicated plot lines, some of which had their beginnings in the earlier movies, but found the coincidence of Topher being in the same church where Spiderman was shirking his suit to be a little too contrived.  It was refreshing to see the \\"Dark Side\\" of Peter Parker, and the almost risque development of the Spiderman/MJ/Hobgoblin love triangle was bold and lent depth to the plot. The effects on the Sandman and Venom were marvelous, and complicated emotional twists having to do with the fine line between right and wrong did much to breathe new life into the franchise.  Don't wait for this on DVD: you're going to want to see it thrice on the big screen.<br /><br />  The theatre was so packed that Tammie and I had to sit at the very front with our necks cocked back at a 125 degree angle, so I'll definitely be going back again when it's thinned out a bit, but still hasn't been moved to a smaller screen in the theatre.<br /><br />J.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|An absolutely amazing show.  Everyone must own a copy and spread the word.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I've been a Linkin Park fan since they came out and I was really looking forward to this album.  I had heard that they were gonna be changing up their sound quite a bit, and they definitely did, and I commend them for that.  I think it's great that they finally took a risk and decided to change, but in doing that they have kind of lost what made them so unique in the first place.  Regardless of the new sound, that really isn't the problem with this album, the problem is that the songs just aren't very strong.  The lyrics are extremely vague and uninteresting, and they continue to sing and whine about the same topics song after song.  Some of the production is lavish and beautiful, but the songs just don't hold up.  The melodies aren't great and Shinoda's rapping is very mediocre, especially on \\"Bleed It Out\\", he even uses from of the same rhymes that he's used in the past, \\"doesnt matter how hard I try\\" - that was used in \\"In The End\\" buddy...come on.  The only decent songs are Shadow Of The Day (even though it's a complete U2 ripoff and the chorus lyrics are stupid and meaningless), The Little Things Give You Away (even though it's about 3 minutes too long), and No More Sorrow (a decent Anti-Bush song).  I'm not sure where they should go from here, I just think they need to take more time to write better songs next time, and not worry so much about changing their sound.  They tried too hard and the results are mediocre and generic.  Oh well..
B000F1IQNC|4.0|`Nanny McPhee' is charming to the last.  The story starts with the Brown household in chaos.  Mr. Brown, a widower (in an earnest bumbling performance from Collin Firth) is a breadwinner who hardly carves out any time for his children.  Smart, but not wise, the children look upon every hired nanny as a nuisance; one they find endless ways to turn in her apron in an extraordinarily short amount of time.  At wits end, he consults the nanny agency for the last time, but, finally, no one will work for him.   That is until independent nanny, Nanny McGhee (a marvelous Emma Thompson), pops up (literally) at his door.  Spellbound, she brings some new order to roost, pronouncing her wishes to the children and using her magical walking stick to enforce consequences on their self-willed ways.  In the meantime, strict Aunt Adelaide (featuring illustrious Angela Lansberry--from blonde bombshell to super sleuth to [here] indomitable matriarch) will cut off his allowance if he doesn't marry by the end of the month.  It seems also having Auntie's way, he will have to give up one of his children to her.  Rashly, he chooses Mrs. Quickly (played with comic wickedness by Celia Imrie), even though his preference for Evangeline, (Beautiful Kelly McDonald) a servant.  With five lessons to learn, Nanny McPhee warns, \\"If you don't want me, but you need me, I'll stay, but when you want me, but no longer need me, I will have to go.\\"    Such enchanted development and straightforward mischief make `Nanny McPhee' a  shelf-worthy family movie.  Visually, they color every scene beautifully to accentuate a fun family film.  (Based on 'Nurse Matilda,' a children's book serial by Christianna Brand. Screenplay by Emma Thompson.)  Shakespearean actor, Derek Jacobi, joins an endearing cast in this lovable children's romp.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|every once in awhile i'll get a wild hair and put on some old iron maiden or smiths or something i only kinda want to hear.  for the most part dissatisfied most of the time.  now something new that's old to listen to.  everyday.  this set is the bomb.  material is stronger than basement.  production is fantastic.  keepin' it simple.  elliott's voice sounds perfect the whole way through.  a must have even if you already have it.
B000MRA5EM|2.0|This film was released to Imax theaters in 3D. It was probably very entertaining and exhilarating in 3D. But, I'm sorry to say, it's very ordinary in 2D. There is nothing more annoying than watching a 3D movie in 2D. All the carefully staged 3D shots, pardon the pun, stick out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />And the narration, while performed by the two outstanding actors Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, is completely one dimensional. Or should I say 1D? Not only is it dull, it's annoying. It sounds like they both read the narration for the entire film and the director, Howard Hall, had buttons for both of their recordings and randomly switched them on and off with no rhyme or reason. There were times, and I'm not exaggerating, when Depp would start a sentence and Winslet would finish it!<br /><br />And as for the title, \\"Deep Sea\\"? Not once did the film journey deeper than the coral reefs.<br /><br />There are a lot of excellent documentaries about the ocean to add to your library. This is not one of them.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Overall, \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is too mellow and soft for me. As with previous reviews, I also felt they are lacking the rap-alternative rock mix that they've had with Meteora and Hybrid Theory. There's a couple rap songs, and the rest are way too mellow excluding \\"What I've Done.\\" I miss the screaming from Chester and the original rough LP style. The only relation I compare with is \\"What I've Done.\\" There is too much \\"pop\\" singing from Chester. Overall, I'm a bit disappointed in the attempt they've made to change their musical style.
B000MRAAJW|2.0|This is narrated by David Attenborough, not Sigourney Weaver.  So if you're expecting the same smooth voice that you heard on the Discovery Channel you will be disappointed.   <br /> <br />Nothing against David Attenborough, but when you're expecting one thing and get something else it's a little disappointing.  They advertise it starring Sigourney Weaver but say at the bottom of the advertisement that it's narrated by David Attenborough.   <br /> <br />Other than that, it's the same as what the Discovery channel showed.  Beautiful scenery and a wonderful show.
B000002LOE|3.0|The reviews seem to either slam this for being too far of a deviation from the norm and too blatantly poppy and saccharine to hailing it for those same reasons. I just like it for what it is. There are some pieces I wonder about, but that is the same with nearly every REM album, even the brilliant Document has songs that don't seem to fit, and so it is on Out of Time.<br /><br />There are plenty of songs I like and amazingly, after repeated plays on radio, Losing My Religion is still that unique hit that doesn't tire out. Maybe it's because it is so lyrically intriguing, I don't know. The only questionable songs I have are Endgame, which sounds like an excessively long intro to Shiny Happy People and, well, Shiny Happy People. I don't mind the song, but it grates on you after a while and seems a bit too much. I'm not analyzing the sarcasm or lack thereof, I just know that it doesn't sound good to me. Speaking of Endgame, I wonder why Peter Buck, a limited albeit melodic guitarist, is so fond of instrumentals on REM recordings. What's the point? Jeff Beck he ain't and even Hendrix eschewed instrumentals for the most part, so why so many from such a modestly talented guitarist? Just a thought.<br /><br />This album is a bit dated and not as in your face as its two preceding brothers nor as jangly and narrow as the band's first three. It is not the sonic overload of Monster. If anything, it is a singular moment in their history where they tried a lot of new ideas and thus loosened the constraints they'd placed on themselves and allowed for the band's future forays. It is a good but not vital part of their catalog.
B00005MP58|5.0|I simply love this adaptation and novel! It is so deep, so meaningful, so romantic that I love it. I whole heartedly recommend this special edition because the actors are as if born to play these roles and the entire plot is evergreen but probably you know that very well. Overall it absolutely deserves 6 stars!
B000LE1GVW|5.0|To be honest i wasn't really impressed by new shoes.  I just had a gut feeling about this guy that turned out to be right.  I absolutely love every song and can not wait for more. (Maybe it is because I am scotish...)
B000001FOL|5.0|This CD contains many lovely songs, Somewhere There's a Feather, Little Sister and many more. Sung by Nico whose distinctive and quite low voice is  bliss to the ears.<br /><br />Her style of music being unique and quite brilliant.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said.<br /><br />This is Megadeth's best album and if you are a fan of metal or Megadeth (although, chances are if you are a fan of theirs you already own this). If you don't own this album and are/want to be a Megadeth fan, stop reading now and buy it.<br /><br />My favorite songs (in no particular order):<br /><br />- Tornado of Souls<br /><br />- Poison Was The Cure<br /><br />- Dawn Patrol<br /><br />- Hangar 18<br /><br />Not a single track on here that I don't like (although the demo versions on the reissue are kinda unnecessary, in my opinion) but those above are just my personal favorites.
0385473788|5.0|Although this book is indispensable in the history of Hitler's antisemitism.<br /><br />Ann Ann is very optimistic, very confident even in such a small and isolated confinement. To read such meaningful, young dreams in her diary is like really knowing and understanding her.<br /><br />It's so very hard to imagine such a young girl could be happy, be romantic ,lively and so hopeful in these terrible circumstances.<br /><br />The book closes on the morbid reality that only Ann's father survived the camps, the other five expired.<br /><br />I recommend it highly, especially to young people who may not appreciate , or who may have thought their situation is oppressive.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|This was a big hit moviue and went one to make three sequel all of them except the next karate kids have the original boy from the first movie in them. For the most recent movie made in 1994 they replaced the boy with a seventeen year old girls who's parents are killed in a car crash. This movies has phonimal music. A young kid challanges the rival of his ex girl friend to a match after he plays a slight prank on him for beatening him up earlier in the movie. Can Mr. Miga train this boy into a fighting champion of power and honor to victory. Find out in the thrilling conclusion. This movie should be fine for ages 12 and up due to mild violence for its time and and occasional curse wored thrown in. A word of adivce try to by these together if you can. You can get part III and four together by themselves on one dvd without parts I and part II but I recommend  you order then one at at time if you don't  decide to get the whole collection at once. The reason why I suggest this is because the cheaptest I saw that they had 3 and four together one dvd with out the first two used is somewere inbetween 39 and 45 dollars if they charge you for shipping. Either get these together with the rest of the collection or buy part III and four on seperate dvds.
6305291446|4.0|In HALLOWEEN H20, Jamie Lee Curtis returns to the film franchise which made her a star.  This is probably the best entry since \\"Halloween II\\", in terms of performances and the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis is back as terrorised Laurie Strode.  To properly enjoy this film, you have to disregard the 4th and 5th films which featured Laurie's daughter, Jamie Lloyd.  There is no daughter here, instead we have Laurie's son John (played by Josh Hartnett).<br /><br />The film picks up 20 years to the day of the original Haddonfield slayings.  With a new name and persona, Laurie Strode is the headmistress of a private school in Southern California, yet still living with the daily terror of her past literally coming back to haunt her.  Sadistic, unstoppable Michael Myers has tracked down her records and decides a little family reunion is needed, but this time, Laurie vows to ensure it will be the final showdown...<br /><br />Jamie Lee Curtis perfectly slips back into the role of Laurie, and the rest of the cast is equally fine, including Jamie's legendary mother (Janet Leigh, \\"Psycho\\") in a fun cameo as the school receptionist, Josh Hartnett as her son, and Adam Arkin as her boyfriend.  There are some brilliant set-ups and action scenes, and the tension is taut.<br /><br />HALLOWEEN H20 originally set out to close the chapter on Laurie and Michael, but the franchise has continued with \\"Halloween: Resurrection\\", again with Jamie Lee Curtis.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This strikes me as the most approachable Rush album since Counterparts. While I think Vapor Trails was excellent and challenging and cathartic, it's not as approachable. For Snakes & Arrows, the mix is not as muddy or aggressive as the heavy Vapor Trails mix, and the instrumentation has more sparkle while preserving heft in the rhythm section. The lyrics and song concepts are sharp and timely, and We Hold On is a classic in the making. And, man, can these guys still play! Like most Rush albums, not everything works, but nearly all of it does. An impressive entry in a deep catalog.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I think the album is very nice, I like the new direction they took.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Linkin Park said they wanted to expand their musical abilities and were in search of a new sound. Minutes to Midnight must've been exactly what they were looking for. A little softer than their previous albums, Minutes gives you more emphasis on the lyrics and lighter rock and DJ mixing. You will be surprised to hear the difference Linkin Park has made. It has a calm sense like Dashboard Confessional's Dusk and Summer with Linkin Parkicized background, meaning similar and signature drum beats. <br /> <br />     \\"Given Up,\\" \\"What I've Done,\\" \\"Leave Out All The Rest,\\" \\"Valentine's Day,\\" and \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" stood out more so than the others for me.  The first two are the closest in sound to the previous albums and are my favorites for that reason. I do, however, have an appreciation for their new sound. The last 3 of my list are slower in tempo and softer rock but beautiful songs with touching lyrics. <br /> <br />     Thankfully, knowing change was in mind, I only disliked one song. \\"No More Sorrow\\" did not sit well with me. It clearly and harshly spoke against George Bush. I really don't like when musicians put politics in music, because it will cause controversy, but I don't think anyone should speak about the President in such a way. Quite disrespectful in my opinion. <br /> <br />     Regardless, if you are a Linkin Park fan or not, I recommend you try it, the clean version I might add (they drop the f-bomb a few times...). The band put more than twice as much time and work than before, so I figured their work would result as trash. Nice album overall.
B00005JPFH|5.0|Like the two previous Spiderman movies this was an excellent movie. This <br />has been a series of outstanding comic book hero movies. The characters <br />are just like they appeared in the original comic books. This movie also has some of the most dazzling and outstanding special effects that you will see in a movie. <br />  Spiderman is riding a wave of popularity. He is beloved by everyone and <br />everywhere. His romance with Mary Jane is still simmering. His friend Harry Osborne is still wanting revenge because of his father's death.He <br />becomes the New Goblin. A new villain comes in the person of the Sandman. <br />He escapes prison and stumbles into a physics testing center. He is changed by one of the experiments being conducted there. He now has the ability to change forms by turning into sand. A meteor crashes near Peter <br />Parker and Mary Jane. A parasite escapes from the meteor. It takes Peter Parker over. He turns into a different person. He turns into an ugly person. He even has eyes for another woman. The parasite leaves Parker and takes over Eddie Brock a rival reporter. Brock turns into Venom an evil villain.It falls upon Spiderman to defeat all of these forces of evil. This makes for an action packed movie. <br />  This is definitely one of the biggest movies to come out this year. If <br />you miss it shame on you.
630289915X|5.0|Just because an individual has all the money in the world, it doesn't automatically make him happy; obviously the case with old man Potter.  On the other hand, just because you think that the world would be a better place if you never left your mark on it, doesn't make it true.  No matter what some of us might think, everything we say or do effects someone in our life.  Regardless of what many of us may think, the world would NOT be a better place without us.  This movie gets an A+ from me.
B000O178BY|5.0|This album is amazing! I love the electronic sound and the overall social commentary. It continues to show the evolution of Trent as an artist.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I don't agree with the idea of Royalty.  I think of it as the rule of the haves over the havenots. But as I was born in the Commonwealth and Elizabeth the Princess was in my country when her father died and she was pronounced Queen, I am particulary drawn to the history of the English Royal family. Incredible acting by helen Mirren--she is the queen.  Also there is an aura of profound sadness about the film--one gets a sense of the thousand years the family has ruled--i recommend this to everyone who appreciated a literate movie.
B000M5AJQS|1.0|the script felt at times like it was pieced together with a Mad Libs book... unsupported plot contrivances are thrown in at random, characters are poorly developed, relationships are unconvincing, and the last 10 minutes of the film were utterly incomprehensible. It's very difficult to understand how scorcese, with access to the best talent around, could put together such a mess.
0596007124|5.0|I read the original Design-Pattern-book from GoF in 1996. I took me quite a long time to understand it. This was due to the academic approach taken and the lack of examples in the original book.<br /><br />Head First Design Pattern is structered completly different. The content<br />concentrates on the most important 14 patterns. There are lots of examples and explanations for every pattern. Thanks to its informal style<br />it is not difficult to remember its content.<br /><br />This book is a good reading for everyone new to the OO-paradigma and<br />who wants to improve his design.
0688170528|5.0|The Pact was an assigned reading for school, and I ended up finishing it in 2 days. The story is so powerful, and it really makes you think about your own life and love situation. Everyone aspires to be in an Emily/Chris relationship, and few people can understand killing yourself for love. This story gives an interesting perspective, and many parts are very unpredictable. You will definitely end up falling in love with \\"The Pact.\\" It's a must-read.
B000M5AJQS|1.0|I am amazed that Hollywood can complain about bootlegging and movie pirating at one moment, and the next get away with a collosal ripoff of an acclaimed international success, stamp it unique and original, win several Academy Nominations, and give absolutely no credit to the source or inspiration of the film.     When, might you ask, has this ever happened? Not so very long ago actually. If one were to recall in 2006, a film entitled The Departed took the stage as one of the most successful box office hits in the world, grossing hundreds of millions of dollars, and jam-packed with an all-star Hollywood celebrity lineup.    Even reknowned critics at the time seemed oblivious to the fact that The Departed, directed by Scorsese, was in fact a blatant rehash of the Andrew Lau original, \\"Infernal Affairs\\". People who professed to know everything about films, hailed the movie as \\"another Scorsese achievement!\\"     Well, if all of Scorsese's other films were undisclosed remakes, then perhaps The Departed was an achievement. Putting integrity aside, the fact that he and his team got away with hundred of millions of dollars in revenue, and received some of the highest honors and most prestigious awards in the industry, all from a film largely adapted from another film, should certainly be considered an achievement of sorts, shouldn't it?     While I visualize the scene of this movie's inception in my mind, I can't help but be amused at how easily The Departed met with success. I imagine it happened something like this...     On one of Brad Pitt's whimsical excursions to the east, he sees Infernal Affairs for the first time. Next thing he knows, he's pitching the idea to Scorsese in the following paraphrase, \\"Hey Martin, I have this great screenplay I want to run by you.\\" [Pitt summarizes the plot of Infernal Affairs, and Scorsese eats it up.] Then as an afterthought, Brad mentions the source of the idea. Scorsese reassures Pitt that noone would make the connection saying something like, \\"We don't really need to mention the original source. Hell, most people in this county wouldn't watch a foreign film if they were cast in it themselves.\\" They both laughed at this... and kept laughing all the way to the bank.    Lately, Hollywood has been backing a string of Asian Market imitations or adaptations including, The Ring, The Grudge, Kill Bill (loosely adapted from Lady Snowblood), and yes, even the Lake House, actually derived from the Korean film, Il Mare. What does it say about the American Film Industry when many of our greatest modern film successes are based on original foreign screenplays? Well, firstly, it shows the world that Hollywood is getting short on ideas, and has little or no qualms about borrowing someone else's screenplay to compensate for its creative gap. Secondly, it reflects on the level of astuteness of the American audience -- that they know no better than to praise and endorse a film that has already been recently released in another country under a different name -- and finally the combination of these two things leads to the conclusion that we will continue to see many more of these foreign remakes to come. After all, if the money and public support is there, Hollywood directors and producers won't quit their [...] ways any time soon.    Although, I'd love to scream out to people, to go check out the foreign section of their local Blockbuster once in a while, with all my efforts, I can't possibly make everyone aware of what they are missing by limiting themselves to mainstream aisles. It's sad to see that Hollywood must thrive on this ignorance, but I can only hope that in the future, if I ever see a Kurosawa adaptation or remake, it won't be a Martin Scorsese and Brad Pitt production.
B000002MTU|5.0|I love Blues and Eric Clapton does it justice. His voice and talent are very evident in this CD.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|This completed by whole series.  Daughter and myself enjoy watching Charmed.  We have bought all the previous seasons and this completed our addition and hope to enjoy watching this DVD.
B00005JPD0|5.0|It was a little dificult to follow but a great movie in the end.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|I agree with most of the rest that Enemy of God is the best Kreator CD before Violent Revolution. Also the best thrash metal CD so far I have listened to. I reckon earlier Kreator CD's are brilliant too but with current production. <br />For the metal fan it is a joy an album this good to surface- all tracks just scream with power, speed, and intense. They should be included in Guitar Hero instead of those shabby and dull 'guitar anthems'. <br />Cannot wait for a next release studio album.
B0000YEEGM|4.0|Very distinct and never attempted story line. In most part of the movie Dustin Hoffman lived as an autistic character, but some places he overacted. Everything was fine in the movie, but the only concern is, would Tom Cruise show the same affection, to his brother, if he was not good at numbers,instead behaved more like a regular autistic patient? <br /> <br />Tom started liking Dustin, only after he came to know that Dustin had some extraordinary number skills, which helped him in clearing his debts. This clearly sheds the light on Tom's selfishness. Any how almost all the people in the world, try to make fortune out of others, so his demeanor doesn't surprise me. <br /> <br />The story, character selection and the screenplay make it a definitely a worth watching movie!
0593055063|1.0|I had never read anything by Dan Brown before, so I decided to see what the hype is all about, and step in. Man, it was an experience! Never have I seen such a exquisite collection of flat characters and implausible plot turns. I was almost impressed. Well, Constant Reader sums up my opinion pretty well on this page, so I won't wast more time on this book than I already have.
B00004RJ71|4.0|Blood In Blood out, what can I say I liked it when I first saw it @ age 8 and I still like it.
033041836X|5.0|Read anything by Alice Seabold...you CAN'T go wrong!  This book is really amazing and very true to life (well it is true).  If you want to get a good perspective on what someone goes through after they have experienced a sexual assault trama, look no further.  Get this book and read it now.  It is a great read for High school aged girls and up.
B0002946M2|5.0|I've owned my Newports for about 3 years now - They've been through everything imaginable, including hiking, running, etc. (not to mention a weekly lawn mowing).  Any other shoe that I've ever worn to mow the lawn turns green and stays that way...  Not these babies!  When I'm done, I hit them with the garden hose and, voila, they're like new all over again.  I could go on and on, but I'll spare you.  Let me just say that Keen has my loyalty for life and, once you've tried these sandals, they'll have yours too!!!  Comfort, style, durability and overall value - You can't ask for any more than that.
B00000K2W1|5.0|A friend of mine once went to a party with Janis and his one comment about her was \\"She was a real mean drunk\\". I believe it. I also believe someone, like a record exec, should have grabbed her by the back of the neck and shook some sense into her. She'd have made a way cool old lady.<br /><br />That didn't happen. The folks who owned a piece of her were much more interested in the cash cow than it's health. Now she's dead and all we have left of her is her music. I own everything she's ever done and while this particular cd isn't all-inclusive by any means, it still has some good tunes and gives us some fine examples of what she can do. In particular BALL AND CHAIN and DOWN ON ME. She's beautiful in SUMMERTIME but you don't really get a good sense of Janis unless she's getting into the song and letting us feel everything she is singing about.<br /><br />Well worth having.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Great funny movie, perfect for the family. Everyone will like it!! get the soundtrack too music is great. Awesome movie.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've listened to the entire album hundreds of times.  It's got anger, melody, meaning, attitude.  My favorite hard rock album in decades.
0767827902|4.0|Although this film is top notch in most respects it left me too sad and depressed to want to give it the full five star rating. The filmmakers certainly do an excellent job of portraying small town North Texas ( the Wichita Falls area is just below Oklahoma) life from the adults who obsess about the teenagers' football playing abilities to the petty cruelties and intrigues spawned by wind swept boredom. The actors are all well cast and bring their characters to life though I'll admit I was a little confused at first as to the family connections or lack there of for Duane, Billy, Sonny and Sam the Lion.   It amazes me  that when the film was released in 1971 it was portraying events that had happened only nineteen years previously (in 1952) since it seemed at the time it debuted it was all ready considered a movie about long gone days.  One note it definitely does deserve the R rating.
0375831002|5.0|I am a freshman boy in High School.  When my mom first bought me this book, and told me about it, I thought I would hate it.  After all, the story followed a 9 year-old girl in Nazi Germany.  In any case, I picked it up a few weeks later, simply because I was bored.  After starting it, I became totally engrossed.   <br /> <br />Death narrates the life of the main character.  At first this sounds strange, but it is actually very interesting and funny.  The story is almost plotless, and instead made up of dozens of mini plots that make up the lives of the characters.  Marcus Zusak does a first-rate job of character development.  By the end of the book, I really got to know each character. <br /> <br />Since reading it, The Book Theif has become my all-time favorite book, and Marcus Zusak my all-time favorite author.  I strongly suggest you read this book.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Never have I seen a documentary style movie that has captured the feeling and essence of a period and group. The entire cast was brilliant. If you know anything about London, get this movie.
0375836675|5.0|This story about Ed Kennedy, a young taxi driver, captivates it's readers.  The writing style is excellent.  Marcus Zusak does an incredible job on character development.  Every character is fully developed, and the reader really gets to know each of them.  The style also makes the book interesting and captivating, despite its fantastical premise.  This is a great read for anyone in high school or older, no matter what genre they enjoy.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is the treasure of our Century,in this series I saw the most ammaizing creatures of our Planet Earth,every aspect was perfect,the scenes,the filming,The Camera men ,and the representation.<br /><br />It should be in every home,University,School,and every educational Organization.And I knew that a generous budget been set for this project to be the most worthifull,it deserve every penny I spent to get it.<br /><br />Thanks for the BBC for this grate video,and thanks for AMAZON for this recommendation.
074356619X|5.0|I listen to these CD's on my way to work; I have listened to whole set at least 5X's and each time I get something else from the messages. <br />The Secret has & is changing my life.  I might not understand/believe every single thing, but with all the truth they do speak of, I'm going to trust them on the other stuff. <br />I keep wishing that I found this while our son lived at home-maybe I could have instilled even more of the power of positive thinking; which I knew before-this just takes it to a much deeper degree. <br />I just can't say enough good things about 'The Secret'. <br />PS:  I purchased the DVD, the book & these CD's-for me, the CD's are the best.
B000LC55F2|5.0|My husband, teenage son and myself watched this movie together and WOW!  You will really want to watch this movie again!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|...made an album that I can listen to over and over and over. Simply beautiful.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Has LP strayed too much from its famous trademark sound? Yes, in the sense that the transition has been too much for the hardcore LP fans.  It really takes a lot of time to listen to this CD to fully appreciate it and many people just don't have the time.  In this case, I decided to spend the time and see if I would warm up or not.<br /><br />I have come to really enjoy the CD.  \\"What I've Done\\" is not the only great track.  I especially like the hard hitting \\"Given Up\\" and the softer tracks including \\"Leave Out All The Rest,\\" \\"Valentines Day,\\" \\"In Pieces,\\" and \\"The Little Things Give You Away.\\"<br /><br />In the meantime, one thing remains true.  Chester Bennington is the best Male Rock Vocalist in the business today.  He keeps proving it over & over and his work on \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is further evidence.  Linkin Park will always be a cut above the rest because of Chester's outstanding vocal skills, regardless how much they continue to mix in the rap.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Until now, I would have always given LP the benefit of the doubt....WOW, I had to struggle to find a couple of decent tunes.  Sad to think this took three times as long to write/produce as their previous.  Perhaps if they wrote with their gut and natural instinct, possibly they \\"overthink\\" on this one.
B00005JPPL|5.0|Next is an awesome movie - I watched it four times! The movie stars Nicolas Cage as Cris Johnson; a Las Vegas magician trying to hide his uncanny gift of being able to see two minutes into the future but only into the future of his own life until he begins seeing \\"vision clips\\" of a woman named Liz who becomes his love interest played by Jessica Biel. He realizes that with Liz, he can see further into the future then ever before. Meanwhile, FBI agent Callie Ferris played by Julianne Moore, for reasons unknown to the audience becomes aware of Cris Johnson's gift and wants to use him to locate an atomic bomb that has been hidden in LA by a Russian Terrorist group. Peter Faulk (Columbo) also puts in a cameo appearance in the movie. <br />     This movie has some awesome action and suspense scenes with Cris using his \\"gift of timing\\" to dodge large falling objects, bullets and laserbeam boobie traps, while Nicolas Cage as Johnson is handsome, compassionate and absolutely charming. Next is a movie that both guys and gals will appreciate.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|ABSOLUTELY THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. LONG, BORING AND DISCONNECTED WITH NOTHING BUT THIS STUPID GUN TO TIE THE FRACTURED STORY TOGEATHER! AND SUBTITLES TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE BORING. I CAN'T BELIEVE I WATCHED THE WHOLE MOVIE WITH THE HOPE THAT SOMETHING WOULD BRING THIS WHOLE MESS TOGEATHER. NOT SINCE \\"EYES WIDE SHUT\\" HAVE I BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED IN A MOVIE. AT LEAST I HAD THE SENSE TO WALK OUT OF \\"EYES WIDE SHUT.\\" BRAD PITT COULD STAND TO TAKE SOME ACTING LESSONS. \\"0\\" STARS WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE.
B000MRA5NS|1.0|This disc will not play on region 4 players (Australia) the only one that i have purchased (over 40 titles) that is fully encoded.  Amazon were kind enough to give me a full refund.  Great people to deal with. <br />
B000N6TX1I|5.0|This is one of the worst movies ever created.  My boyfriend and I began bouncing Bud Light bottles on the carpet to amuse ourselves while watching this dreadful creation...amazingly we discovered that our apartment's carpet has a bouncy layer and sends beer bottles soaring through the air.  We would have never discovered the fantastic secret of our carpet without this dull and mind-numbing movie....so for that we give it 5 stars!!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is a movie worth purchasing on DVD. Finally an actor who lived up to the James Bond character in the novels. The last few actors portraying Bond were anemic at best with screenplays that lacked substance. This screenplay is exceptional, stylized and captivating. Daniel Craig's interpretation of Bond is a more human and multifaceted character with a good dose of steaming sex appeal. Finally Bond done right and \\"worth every penny\\".
B000065BPB|2.0|Like most things I purchase, I come to Amazon and check out the reviews and if it is positive I purchase it.  That usually works well but not with these headphones. <br /> <br />The headphones are huuge, you cant wear them in public. After 2 minutes of wearing them my ears become very hot and I have to remove them.  <br />Very low in bass and highs, I wish I did more research before purchase or tried them on before I bought them. <br /> <br />Waste of time and money and I cant return them now. Do more research, there suspiciously seems to be too many positive reviews on Amazon fot his product....
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I just got the new album.  It sounds good, real good.  And in a year, I'll consider it a five-star album.   <br /> <br />Here's the thing about Wilco.  As a lot of the other reviewers point out, for every album they do something different, and for a lot of us, it takes months, up to a year, to finally enjoy it.  With the exception of \\"Heavy Metal Drummer,\\" I was ready to chuck Yankee Hotel right away.  And it took me over a year to find Ghost is Born even listenable (helped when we saw them live).  Now \\"Handshake Drugs\\" is one of alltime favorites.  They just do it different every time, and you just have to get used to it.  For you fans who came to this band with those \\"experimental\\" rock albums, now you're learning that Wilco's sound is pretty much what music Jeff Tweedy et al. is in the mood to make.  But be patient; they hit the mark every time.   <br /> <br />This album doesn't sound like it's going to be too hard for me to love at any rate.  My favorite Wilco is the second half of Summerteeth (\\"When You Wake Up\\" / \\"Pieholden Suite\\"), so all these sweet mellow melodies are bliss.  The first three songs are absolutely beautiful.  Speaking of \\"Impossible Germany,\\" anytime your song is compared to Steely Dan, that's a great thing.  \\"Sides with the Seeds\\" starts with some bluesy solo Lennon, but ends in that guitar solo we all love.  \\"Walken\\" reminds me of a raucus Band song, and that's always a good thing.  \\"On and On...\\" is just beautiful.  The only throwaway that I see is the jittery \\"Shake it Off.\\"  Eleven out of twelve, not bad.   <br /> <br />You'll love it, eventually.  That's how it always is with Wilco.

1582701709|4.0|While Byrne breaks no new ground in this book, what she does is present in an engaging and easily processed synthesis of what we've learned about the power of our mind when we tap universal intelligence, or what we could call the intelligence of the spirit.  This is a book that will appeal to many who do not wish to read deep, seminal treatments.   <br /> <br />This is a book for the masses, presenting what we all need to embrace.  If you think you can, you will.  Ask and believe.  Answers will manifest themselves when you're ready to internalize and apply them.  I recommend this book, and I recommend reading and rereading it.  There's power in authentic, bone-deep faith. <br /> <br />I was surprised, however, that she chose not to include Depak Chopra, whose work rises to the eminence of many whom she cites (\\"Ageless Body, Timeless Mind,\\" for example).  He's spoken in compelling fashion for about two decades now.  This puzzles me, and seems a serious oversight.
1401307450|5.0|What a great read...i couldnt put it down.  I'm a huge music fan, but not like THE number one RHCP fan.  I've never seen them live, and dont have every one of their CD's.  But i've always been a fan of Anthony, and interested in what he's been thru.  I had a loved one who sufferred from drug addiction, and this gave me soooo much insight into the disease.<br /><br />I was surprised at how warm and loving he seems, and enjoyed the stories of his childhood, all the band stories - i'm amazed hes still alive, and i dont know HOW he doesnt have any kids!?<br /><br />The ending is great, and his reflections on drug addiction and sobriety really moved me.  I really thought this book had it all.  I LOVED it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Whenever I want to watch a DVD and don't know what to put on the set, I always reach for this amazing compilation. It never ceases to entertain, with outstanding filming, breathtaking footage, and the polished David Attenborough commentary. I am glued to the set until the end. It is a cherished addition to my DVD collection.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I enjoyed this movie for many reasons.  The acting is natural, as are the actors.  It is a movie I can watch with my grandchildren and not be embarrassed by the content.  The Straight Story is touching, warm, real and done with intelligence.<br /><br />This is a movie I will watch several times without tiring of it; there is something new to see each time I play it.  The Straight Story shows the wisdom, value and knowledge older people have and this is something totally ignored by our society - a culture that chases after the young, who chase after who-knows-what.<br /><br />Bravo to all who created this art piece.
B000MGVCFY|5.0|*The following comments are in regard to the bonus tracks on this release. To read my opinions on the original content of this album, check out my review under:<br /><br />\\"Seventh Sojourn\\" by The Moody Blues (Audio CD - 1997) - Original recording remastered<br /><br />Here is what I enjoyed about each of these outstanding bonus offerings...<br /><br />\\"Isn't Life Strange\\" (Original Version):<br /><br />The piano \\"count in\\" was a surprise, as I don't believe a piano was anywhere to be heard on the final version of the song! The instrumental break, that was edited out of the final version, was beautifully executed and reminded me of \\"The Voyage\\" from \\"On The Threshold Of A Dream\\" (In certain places) and \\"The Word (Mellotron mix)\\" from the Deluxe Edition of \\"In Search Of The Lost Chord,\\" in true Mike Pinder mellotron style! The fadeout is extended a little further, so we can hear The Moodies singing a tad more than on the final version of the song. :)<br /><br />\\"You and Me\\" (Beckthorns Backing Track):<br /><br />This version of the song blew me away with the keyboard tracks in place of the vocals ... To me, the instrumentation sounded similar to the mellotrons heard on \\"The World Today,\\" from Mike Pinder's 1994 release, \\"Among The Stars.\\" The extra instrumentation, that was edited out of the finished product, was a treat, as well! Sounds like background music that could be used during a Moody Blues radio interview. :)<br /><br />\\"Lost in a Lost World\\" (Instrumental Demo):<br /><br />The haunting electric guitars, in place of the vocals, really grabbed my attention on this version of the song ... This riff sounds more like David Gilmour's style (Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" and \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason,\\" in places) than Justin Hayward's! What a wickedly beautiful sound! :)<br /><br />\\"Island:\\"<br /><br />Until this reissue came along, this amazing unreleased gem would have made a fine bonus track to Justin Hayward's \\"Songwriter.\\" The tune also reminds me of something Justin would have come up with for \\"A Question Of Balance,\\" had The Moodies created the song at that time. More magnificent mellotron/Chamberlain playing from Mike Pinder, yet again! \\"Island\\" definitely has that \\"'Classic 7' Moody Blues\\" feel to it. :)<br /><br />Just like the 1997 CD remaster of \\"Seventh Sojourn,\\" this Deluxe Edition also featured a topnotch remastering job! I would recommend this release to any Moody Blues fan or collector. Thanks for reading! God Bless... :)ustin would have come up with for \\"A Question Of Balance,\\" had The Moodies created the song at that time.

B00001ODGR|5.0|Classic Styx, revisited.  Great performance, with alot of the old classic tunes.  Performance is great, and even emotional with the tribute to John. <br />His brother looks a little stiff on base, but the music rules. <br /> <br />This is well worth the purchase for any Styx fan.  Lots of energy and variety of performance.  New drummer is very good.  Added features are interesting too.
B000002GQL|5.0|To start off, what a topnotch remastering job on this splendid release! :)<br /><br />On this occasion, Mike Pinder gets to open up a Moody Blues album with one of his compositions, \\"Lost In A Lost World\\"... I like the instrumental verse in the middle of the song, as well as the stereo effects on the vocals near the end, with the \\"So many people\\" chant on the right channel and the \\"Lost In A Lost World\\" chant on the left (Best experienced through headphones).<br /><br />\\"When You're A Free Man\\" is an equally fine Mike Pinder song, and there is a sense of hope in the lyrics ... I love the one line that states:<br /><br />\\"You know that love lasts ... For Eternity...<br /><br />Let's be God's Children ... And live in Perfect Peace\\"<br /><br />I love how the instrumentation in the fadeout to this track merges with the fade-in of the drums in the intro to \\"I'm Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band).\\" Both this superb John Lodge composition and Justin Hayward and Graeme Edge's \\"You And Me\\" are excellent rockers that open up and close the second half of this album ... The brass effects on the former track are really neat and give the song that extra \\"punch,\\" plus the group chant on the Justin and Graeme composition, before the lyrics \\"You're an ocean full of faces\\" is executed to perfection!<br /><br />Both Justin's \\"New Horizons\\" and \\"The Land Of Make Believe\\" have a dreamy atmosphere about them, especially \\"Make Believe\\" (Beautiful xylophone effects and flute). Excellent dueling electric guitars (Also best experienced through headphones) on the solos to \\"New Horizons,\\" as well. :)<br /><br />For me, Ray Thomas' pleasant \\"For My Lady\\" paints the picture of a man on a cruise boat with the woman of his dreams! I love the way the song flows into John Lodge's fantastic \\"Isn't Life Strange,\\" as both songs are played in the same chord ... Both Justin and John do an excellent job trading off vocals, and the harmonies sound nice on the choruses. I'm glad that this remastered edition of the album (As well as \\"Time Traveller\\") features a clean fadeout of the song that doesn't abruptly merge into the intro to \\"You And Me,\\" like the earlier CD format of the album, released in the 1980's, did. To go off on a slight tangent for a bit, I'm probably one of the few (Or maybe the only one) listeners who enjoys the 1989 orchestral remake of \\"Isn't Life Strange,\\" from \\"Legend Of A Band,\\" just as much as the original version!<br /><br />It's difficult for me to pick a favorite on this recording, since I enjoy all eight songs equally! I want to close this review by typing out one of my favorite Justin Hayward quotes from the live \\"Hall Of Fame\\" release:<br /><br />\\"We're just Singers in a Rock and Roll Band!\\"<br /><br />Thanks for reading!

0060557818|5.0|It truly is a fun ride along the London Underground - and the closest book to it in spirit, is Alice in Wonderland - but this one's brilliant too!
B000NA77YO|4.0|About a year ago I decided to pull Mob Rules and Heaven and Hell out of my CD collection on throw them into the CD player in my car. As I listed to them, I said to myself \\" It's a shame that I will never be able to see this stuff played live by these guys again\\". But we know the rest of the story. Both Mob Rules and Heaven and Hell are truly classic rock /metal (whatever you want to call it) albums and RJD takes Sabbath to a whole new level of talent and songwriting greatness. Although this compilation is excellent, I would have liked to see a different set of songs. First off, the studio version of Children of the Sea should have undoubtedly been on this CD (what metal cover band in the 80' didn't attempt this one? \\") Also, Country Girl & Sign of the Southern Cross (what were they thinking here?) should be on here. My recommendation would be to go out and buy used copies of Heaven and Hell and Mob rules for a small price in addition or instead of this CD and you will have a better idea of what the Dio era was all about.
B000QQH4YS|3.0|IS THIS AT LAST THE UNRATED VERSION OF THIS MOVIE?????  MGM IS WRONG WITH US  BECAUSE THE LAST DVD IS CUT SO????
B00004VXF2|3.0|One thing first: this is a record consisting of 4 pieces of continuous unlistenable feedback. Nothing else. It drones on forever. A lot has been written about this record and most reviews do not really explain that it is simply noise. There is no melody no rhythm no structure. It cannot really qualify as music as such. If you read any piece on it by Lester Bangs for example or any review, you will not really get what it is until you actually listen to it. It does not matter if it was a joke or an actual attempt at exeprimental music, it fails a both. Still the concept of a major artist indulging in such a work at that time and at this point in his career is fascinating. Beacuse of that it is an indispensable addition to any serious rock collection: simply because it is historically important in a strange way. You will probably not listen to it often. Others have done stuff that is pretty close such as Steve Shelley with Sky Yen.
B000NQR7KM|5.0|Very impressive package wich covers most areas in audio/video from that period.    Audio: (SACD Surround and stereo mixes,DVD Audio(Dolby Surround,DTS 96/24).  Video:(1976 rehearsal concert with Bill Bruford (stereo only, letterbox), Music videos:Ripples, Robbery,Assault and Battery,A trick of the Tail (Dolby or DTS surround) plus 15 mn. interview with the band in 2007.      I am a long time Genesis fan (1971-1980) and i am very pleased after seeing every major band putting a vast array of products on the market,to note that Genesis did not inundate us with very similar or diluted compilations but seem to have got it right with this series of remasters.      Hopefully,the rest of the back catalog will be on par with the \\"Trick of the Tail\\" package.
B000000IS7|5.0|While some say that Damn the Torpedoes is his best album, I tend to disagree. The song structures in this one is far superior. The album rocks a lot more and has some killer tunes which in my opinion seemes to lack on Damn. Anyway it is also an expensive Gold CD edition, which I never know if it is so superior in the end, but who cares since it sounds really great.
1582701709|3.0|The book was good but it seemed to be a culmination of many books on the same subject, nothing new. <br />I also found it to be repetitive. <br />Not really worth the price.
B000MTOKY6|5.0|This is a very beautiful album that I never get tired of listening to.  It reminds me a lot of Dylan's classic \\"breakup\\" album which happens to also be my favourite album of his \\"Blood On the Tracks\\" as well as that classic Carole King masterpiece, \\"Tapestry\\".  Joni's voice is so heartfelt and her lyrics so meaningful, it's no surprise how much this album has inspired so many great singer/songwriters after her.  I could hear a lot of what Kate Bush would later sound like on this as well as some Tracy Chapman and Suzanne Vega as well.  Now this version has been released in a mini lp replica sleeve design which pretty accurately recreates the original lp design.  We all know that for years now, the Japanese have been the masters at mlps cds and they still have the edge over Rhino at least for now. The Japanese have the good sense to include a plastic sleeve for the cd to prevent dust and more importantly scratches from damaging the shiny side of the cd. Otherwise, the outer cardboard sleeve is well done and is good quality unlike some of the other mlps versions I've seen out there that have flimsy or poor quality, thin cardboard covers. I don't actually mind the fact that there are no bonus tracks as I feel that most of the time, bonus tracks do not add to the enjoyment of the original album tracks and many a time actually spoils the listening enjoyment when they are countless outtakes or alternate takes of album tracks or worse interviews and obvious filler material.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you don't mind the propensity for the lack of proper plastic protection for the cd to result in scratches on the data/music side of your cd, then for lovers of the mlps format, this may be a worthwhile addition to your other Joni Mitchell albums. Overall, I like the whole Rhino Replica idea but I hope they'll take my comments seriously and seek to better protect the discs from damage and also seek to remaster and hence improve the sound quality of future releases. The following are just some of the albums I'd love to see as Rhino Replicas:<br /><br />\\"Decade\\" - Neil Young<br /><br />\\"After the Gold Rush\\" - Neil Young<br /><br />\\"Deja Vu\\" - Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young<br /><br />\\"Back In Black\\" - AC/DC<br /><br />\\"\\"Partners In Crime\\" - Rupert Holmes<br /><br />\\"No Goodbyes\\" - Daryl Hall & John Oates<br /><br />\\"Abandoned Luncheonette\\" - Daryl Hall & John Oates<br /><br />\\"Not Fragile\\" - Bachman-Turner Overdrive<br /><br />\\"Van Halen I & II\\" - Van Halen<br /><br />\\"L.A.

B00005ASHM|5.0|Happy to experience this cd.  I had only heard great things about it, now I know why!
B000MTOKXW|2.0|Album content 5 stars, this version of the album 2 stars<br /><br />Years ago when I picked up a book that ranked the best albums of all time, I had a great shock when I found this album at #1. Could it possibly be better than the #2 \\"Pet Sounds\\" or even the #3 \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\"? Fueled by a combination of curiosity and utter disbelief, I decided to get the cd and lo and behold, I was blown away.<br /><br />The music was unlike anything I had ever heard before and it was obvious from the start that this was a very original work of art and that Arthur Lee was a brilliant genius at work. It became clear to me as well that \\"Forever Changes\\" is very deserving of its lofty ranking. A simply beautiful album and probably as close as pop music has ever come to being high works of art.<br /><br />Now this version has been released without any bonus tracks in a mini lp replica sleeve design which pretty accurately recreates the original lp design.  Unfortunately, it hasn't been very well remastered and does not sound quite as good as the prior Rhino version.  We also know that for years now, the Japanese have been the masters at mlps cds and they still have the edge over Rhino at least for now.  The Japanese have the good sense to include a plastic sleeve for the cd to prevent dust and more importantly scratches from damaging the shiny side of the cd.  When I received my cd from Amazon, there was already a couple of lines on my cd because there was no plastic sleeve protecting my disc from the paper sleeve which has two folds that what with movement during shipping and everything meant that I received a scratched cd.  Otherwise, the outer cardboard sleeve is well done and is good quality unlike some of the other mlps versions I've seen out there that have flimsy or poor quality, thin cardboard covers.  I don't actually mind the fact that the 7 bonus tracks on the prior Rhino release are missing as I guess most of the time, bonus tracks do not add to the enjoyment of the original album tracks and many a time actually spoils the listening enjoyment when they are countless outtakes or alternate takes of album tracks or worse interviews and obvious filler material.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you don't mind the diminished sound quality as compared to the prior Rhino release and the propensity for the lack of proper plastic protection for the cd to result in scratches on the data/music side of your cd, then for lovers of the mlps format, this may be a worthwhile addition to your other Love albums.

0393320928|5.0|As others have noted this is the perfect companion to Reflections...... which I listened to on a long road trip. However this book needs to be read and the content savored while Reflections is more entertainment.     The Challenger investigation shines light on all that is wrong with Washington and the good people who perform despite the system. The book is worth reading if for only these chapters. These chapters are also must reading for anyone who read the 9/11 report and either believes it or completely distrusts it. Sadly the Washington insiders are masters at controlling independent panels from the Kennedy investigation to the most recent policical investigations. The term independent panel simply does not exist in DC. Sadly too many on the Challenger panel were working hard to protect that which most needed to be fixed. I believe the same truth holds true with the 9-11 investigation where the \\"scope\\" was carefully crafted to avoid potholes.     What's refreshing is Feynman's refusal to go along and also the coaching he received from the USAF general along the way.     Non technical, the book is suitable for interested readers from 10-100. Great illustration of how much positive impact can come from one great mind.
1400082773|4.0|When I purchased \\"Dreams from My Father\\" I was looking for more political firepower from the US Senator.  At the time of my purchase I did not realize it was written over ten years ago. <br /> <br />While the book fails to provide what I was looking for in making a selection in regard to the presidential elections, it did give excellent background to this accomplished man.  Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) tells his story with such eloquence and passion, and provided excellent reading material.   <br /> <br />\\"The Audacity of Hope\\" helps to solidify the Senator's political positions, but his storytelling technique makes \\"Dreams from My Father\\" the better of his two books and one of my personal favorites.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I actually really like this CD. I admit many of the songs have a softer sound, but to me, a lot of them still sound like the classic Linkin Park. \\"Given Up\\", \\"No More Sorrow\\", and \\"What I've Done\\" have less rapping, but still have the heavier sound that LP is known for. Also, \\"Hands Held High\\", though nothing like the old LP, became one of my favorites instantly, it also has more vocals from Mike, which I appreciated. It probably just depends on what you personally love about Linkin Park, but if you liked their previous CDs and don't mind if this isn't EXACTLY the same, give it a listen.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I was getting really tired of the special effects emphasis in the last few Bond movies--as much as I love Pierce Brosnan, neither of those movies did either his acting or the plot lines justice. I was dubious (a blond Bond?) but I have to say I am completely taken with Craig's physicality and his infrequent but adorable smirk. And that opening scene with the free running!! Awesome!! and without depending on free falls into pilotless planes. Again, I adore Brosnan, but really folks...  My only caveat, after watching it 3 times at home now, is that each time I watch it I like Vesper less and less. Eva Green did her job just fine, but the character grates more each time I see her---last time I just turned at off at the end when James starts his rehab. I have liked the female counterparts to Bond, like Pussy Galore, who were strong and could match him point for point, instead of the \\"you don't HAVE to do it James\\" whining. I'm female, and I'm fed up with seeing females always portrayed as weak, whiney (but beautiful so I'll use you for my enjoyment but I won't count on you for anything) Barbie-doll characters. I've heard that's what men like about the Bond movies, but there's a huge female audience out there now---let's get over it folks. ... And I love Dame Densch's revamped 'M'!
0553573403|5.0|This is as good as it gets. I loved this whole series. Since the other reviewers have said it so well all I would point out is that there is an appendix in the back of the book that is very helpful for giving you a quick reference on all the characters. I was totally hooked and the only thing that bothered me about the book was when I had to put it down. This is a page turning wonderful delight.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|For starters, I'm not Gen-X or Gen-Y, I'm a few years from fifty and a huge Linkin Park fan.  I do not have enough praise for Hybrid Theory and Meteora [and Reanimation].  But I have to [reluctantly] say that my reaction on first listen was torn between:<br /><br />1)  Stunned:  I listed to the first 4-5 cuts and just couldn't stand it anymore and started cueing each song for 10-30 seconds before cueing the next cut<br /><br />2)  Profound Disappointment:  What happened?  This is not growing, this is forgetting who you are and from where you came, not to mention how you got there.<br /><br />I read the booklet while I listened to the few cuts I did and the short samples I could tolerate afterwards.  I enjoy reading their notes on their songs and moods and thoughts while recording, writing and mixing.  A pattern was developing - many notes contained:  \\"Rick felt we should do this...\\" or \\"Rick said we should try that...\\" or \\"Rick told us that...\\".  Three words guys - BLAH BLAH BLAH.  I finally thought to myself, if Rick Ruben told each of you [or collectively] to jump off a bridge, would you do it?<br /><br />Being a musician/composer and producer myself, I realize Rick Ruben is a well known, well respected, talented and award-winning producer.  With that said, perhaps Mr. Ruben should stick with the Chili Peppers, Johnny Cash and the Beasties and stay away from Linkin Park.  Not everything he touches turns to gold and this is both a reminder and visceral proof.<br /><br />If this new direction is his idea, he has done the band a real disservice.  You will not have to read many reviews here to find out that they decided to take a detour in their usual sound and style.  Now whether this is due to the perception that rap/nu-metal has seen its heyday, or Mr. Ruben's suggestions, or Warner Brothers legendary A&R paranoia or other demographics I couldn't say.  What I do know is that Linkin Park had a unique sound between their hypnotic mix of power metal, Shinoda's rapping & turntable scratching, Bennington's seemingly limitless vocal power and truly amazing and flawless production.  They were ALREADY unique and beloved and really had no need to change their sound or follow a different direction, at least not for a while.  It IS possible to stay within a niche while still growing and expanding.<br /><br />One of the few songs that Shinoda does rap on is backed with pipe organ and marching snare drums [PIPE ORGAN AND MARCHING DRUMS?  GROAN!]  I heard maybe 2 songs plus the intro that were tolerable and reminiscent of the LP sound but the rest were horrible, intolerable or at the very best, not what I was hoping for from their new release.<br /><br />Again, let me reiterate that I'm not slamming Mr. Ruben - I certainly recognize his long string of successes.  Perhaps, Mr. Ruben can dig up Johnny Cash and get into the posthumous album release craze.  I'm not slamming the guys either - perhaps you all can give Don Gilmore a call, apologize like you never have before, beg his forgiveness and hire him back as co-producer.<br /><br />Guys:  More scratching, more rap, more of Chester's euphoric wailing, more chunky beats, more slamming bass and more crunchy metal.<br /><br />DO WHAT YOU DO BEST - IT HAS BROUGHT YOU TO WHERE YOU ARE!<br /><br />It's always nice to aspire to be more, to reach out, to grow.  But it's also a crime to lose track of who you are and from where you came, which strikes me as the case with this album.<br /><br />I sincerely doubt this CD will ever take another spin on any player of mine.  I did relent and took it in the car with me a few days after my first disappointing listen, but I could not tolerate much there either and switched it off about 4-5 songs into it.<br /><br />But I'll give you one more shot guys - I'll buy your next album, without hearing a thing, probably on pre-order once again.  But if it's like this one, Ciao-Baby - we officially part paths at that time and I'll just treasure Hybrid Theory, Meteora and Reanimation for the works of art that they are and wish you all the best.<br /><br />Nuff said-<br /><br />Respectfully submitted-easure Hybrid Theory, Meteora and Reanimation for the works of art that they are and wish you all the best. <br /> <br />Nuff said- <br />Respectfully submitted- <br /> <br />
B00005JPAO|5.0|I just finished watching The Queen; starring Helen Mirren, who won this year's Oscar, and a powerful cast of stars who support the story of a week in the life of the Queen of England right after p. Diana's passing away in a car accident.<br /><br />The movie shows a rare glimpse into the private lives of the Royal Family of Great Britain. A human angle, if you will. Sitting together in a family room, which looks like a family room in a typical middle class house. But logical in its dimensions as humans can comfortably sit in a room and watch TV. What's extraordinary is that they are watching themselves and grumbling about it.<br /><br />James Cromwell, an American actor, does an excellent job adding flesh, blood, and a loud voice to an otherwise vertical shadow that is the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen's husband, who is apparently a greater influence than one might think of a shadow.<br /><br />Michael Sheen superbly depicts Tony Blair--a favorite communicator on par with Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />So the movie essentially says the Queen and her family are humans and they made a mistake. But what's important is how this mistake is characterized and why it needed to be rectified. The mistake was that the Queen failed to understand and empathize with her people: her job. It needed to be rectified because of fear that the English monarchy maybe abolished (the film quotes Blair to have said one fourth of that country wants it that way). The fear itself stems likely from the fear of no income to maintain a lifestyle befitting royalty.<br /><br />I was once told that the reason English people tolerate the monarchy is because they bring in more money into the UK than they take out. It is, in essence, a marketing tool for the island nation. Perhaps with the Queen this is true. I have a hard time believing it will continue to be so after her. Their 40,000-acre backyard might bring in more income. I also read somewhere p. Charles is a good gardener--that might help.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|If you are familiar with earlier works from this band you will most likely enjoy Sky Blue Sky. It's definately Wilco but just different enough to be new and fresh. The guitar work is much more resolved compared to previous albums and you can pick out each player individually with ease. Tweedy's vocals are very focused. The songwriting is right up there with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, A Ghost Is Born and Summerteeth. No disapointment for fans and if you are unfamiliar with earlier works this album stands on it's own just fine. Maybe their best yet.

B000CFLFX4|1.0|I have all hardwood floor in my house so I thought this cordless sweeper is a good idea.  But it doesn't really do the job.   <br /> <br />I don't have problem with the battery as many other reviewers do.  The battery part is actually the only good part.  It's small and very easy to recharge (just plug it to any outlet) and it does last as long as I need it to.  Yet that's probably all that's good about it.   <br /> <br />As a sweeper, I think it's totally terrible.  I use it to pick up food crumbs but most of the time it just pushes them around.  I have to run through the same area three times or more and most of the time it'd still leave something behind.  I got really frustrated when that happens.  Plus the filter is also terrible (not sure it's really a filter or not, there is a small air passage area covered by a filter like \\"net\\" located on top of the sweeper).  My house is very dusty (bad air in Los Angeles I guess) and the dust picked up by the sweeper would totally escape from that little \\"hole\\".  Everytime when I try to clean the dust pan, I saw the top of the sweeper was totally covered with dust (I don't even want to think how much dust had escaped back into the air)!  I had to use a swiffer to clean it everytime! <br /> <br />Now after using it for only 4 times, I just can't stand it anymore and it's been sitting in the corner of my closet taking up space.  I've decided to throw it away next week.  What a total wast of money. <br /> <br />I would recommend Eureka cordless Vac which has very decent suction and power and is perfect for house with hardwood floors.
B000NA2776|5.0|ok everytime i listen to this CD i am happy so i love this CD and its awesome so go get it
0060776579|5.0|I think Harv hit the nail on the head with this one. I love the reinforcing of the mantras and the actions he gives you to take. It is a great book for anyone who wants to change the way they think about their situation, financial or otherwise. This is a must for all!!
B00005JPAO|3.0|The movie and storyline was good and kept us entertained.  My problem was with the DVD itself.  The playback had problems and got 'stuck'/froze at the start of the movie.  The only way to get the movie to play was to advance to chapter two and then rewind to the beginning of the movie (without going all the way back to 0:00:00 or the problem would re-occur).  I have an ONKYO DVD  player and have never had this problem with it, it still plays all of my other movies just fine.  I did have the exact same thing happen with 'Deja Vu'.  Both of these movies are by Disney companies, could it have to do with the mastering/copy protection?  It was very frustrating having to watch the first five minutes or so in rewind before being able to see the movie.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|With the cult fan success of the TV Series Firefly, Joss Whedon's OTHER labor of love (the first being the TV Series Buffy the Vampire Slayer), found life even after cancellation.  In what is a rare occurrence where a TV show is cancelled and then made into a major motion picture Firefly, aptly re-named Serenity, pushed forward and finished on most levels what was started with the intelligent weekly series.    Here's a short time line; in the fall of 2002, a new show called Firefly came on the airwaves of FOX television.  It was something of a hybrid.  Part serialized western and part sci-fi adventure and featuring the sharp and witty dialogue that Whedon's fans come to expect.  It was a hit with critics and the few people who watched it.  Unfortunately several factors came into play that clinched it's demise.  FOX barely promoted it, mainly because they didn't like the direction the show started out in the pilot episode.  In a rush, a whole new action oriented episode was created in one weekend and even though it was a good episode, the higher ups obviously didn't like Whedon's `I want to do it my way' approach.  After several successful seasons of producing Buffy and Angel, both very successful shows, you would think the Execs at FOX would give Whedon the creative license to do the show the way he thought it should be done.  Alas, the businessmen thought they knew how to create complex entertaining stories and characters more than anyone else.  With a sour relationship the show was never promoted beyond a few short notices during the sports broadcasts that pre-empted the regular viewings.  In addition, no support was given to Whedon to create the show as a character driven show.  They simply wanted the action variety and nothing else.  They wanted the characters to be the bad-a$$ soldiers.  Whedon wanted to create characters who were flawed and but happen to have skills, some good some bad.  In other words, a balanced character study.  In December of 2002, the show was canceled and the two hour pilot episode was aired as the last show, that statement alone should clue anyone in on the thought process of the Execs at FOX.      Whedon swore that Firefly would continue in some way shape or form.  With that, many would hope that the show would be picked up again by another network.  Sci-Fi channel, UPN, WB, fans wished someone would get this show back on the air.  It never happened.  Later in 2003, the DVD box set was released with three unaired episodes, fourteen in all.  It was a hit.  Amazon sales of the DVDs reached records highs and the reviews for the set were consistently in the four or five star range.  Many reviews read with phrases like `I never heard of the show, but I saw the DVDs and loved it.'  Later in 2003, it was confirmed that a major motion picture would be created.  Fans rejoiced.  As the movie went into production and teaser trailers were released, fans salivated and semi-fans were anxious.  Unfortunately the combination of two and the lack luster media coverage didn't amount to great ticket sales.  The movie barely covered it's expenses.  But it was critically hailed as a great movie and anyone who saw it seemed to like it as well.    Ok, finally, I get to my synopsis of the movie itself; don't worry if you never saw the show, what you need to know is conveniently condensed into the first ten minutes.  It's a great scene, a testament to Joss' Whedon's writing ability to fit fourteen episodes of story into just a few minutes.  Taking place 500 years in the future, it centers on River Tam, a brilliant young girl who was manipulated by the government for covert purposes.  An Operative is assigned to find River and bring her in, or kill her.  Once past that we are treated to the first shot of Serenity, the ship.  Then we are introduced to it's crew as a long camera shot follows Captain Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) through the entire inner workings, displaying his relationship with each crew member.  It's so efficient and so well done, you can't believe you're entertained at the same time.  The plot continues the main story arc of the TV show as River and Simon Tam are being chased by the Alliance, the unionized Government of the US and Chinese that governs the core planets.  As the Captain picks up a job, this one being somewhat unlawful, they are suddenly attacked by the Reavers, a group of cannibalistic and brutal murders who are feared through out the system.  At the close of the job, River and Simon are expected to leave the ship for good.  When River suddenly goes ballistic in a bar, beating the pulp out of everyone in the place, the operative is tuned in on their location and the chase is on.  Instead of running, the crew find themselves tracking down the source of Rivers outburst.  I don't want to say much more because hopefully I've peaked your interest.  If not, I'll say this; Serenity is a top-notch character study and action/sci-fi adventure that goes, and goes fast.  The actors love their characters and to top that off, the dialogue is excellent.  With such a balanced crew and cast of characters you get a sense that this is a group of people who may not always like each other, but know they have to work together for something greater.        The movie ends in surprising ways, Whedon's way of saying, `Maybe there will be a sequel, maybe there won't.'  He can never tell.  But suffice to say, even if he never does anything for the Firefly/Serenity Universe again, at least he got to complete this story and give his fans a glimmer of hope that one day it may rise again.

B00005JPLU|1.0|Horrible, horrible. A true suck fest. Bad dialog, stupid plot diversions, and unrealistic fighting. From what we know, Spartans didn't fight like that and they didn't talk like that. Nothing seems real in the movie. A true shame to one the greatest battles in the history of the world. A perversion of history. This movie is for maybe 12 year olds.
B000002LK1|5.0|I got hooked on this album when it came out, and my love for it hasn't dimished one bit. It's still the best.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|When I state,\\"middle of the road,\\" I am not suggesting it is bad. Far from it. I really enjoy all of the songs on this CD. I am looking forward to hearing many of these songs live on the upcoming tour. I think the production quality is far superior than VT. However, Lifeson is still using a \\"wall of sound\\" approach on many songs, and there is a lot of vocal layering by Geddy. I personally think that's fine, but a lot of fans apparently don't. <br /> <br />Most of the songs are mid-tempo, but I personally don't have a problem with that. To me, they are all interesting in their own right. The Choruses on S&A are very melodic and catchy, moreso than anything they've put out in the last 15 years or so, maybe even 20 years.  <br /> <br />The musicianship is excellent throughout, but there are only a few moments of over the top self indulgence (especially on the instrumentals). If you are expecting them to go back to \\"the way they were before,\\" then you will be disappointed. I wasn't, but based on many of the comments on this site, apparently a lot of people were. I don't understand that, as it has been quite clear for many years that Rush no longer feels that is a good way to make music anymore. Again, that doesn't mean that I think those who don't like current Rush are \\"wrong,\\" rather I just feel that it is delusional to think the band will somehow abandon everything they feel about songwriting just to please some fans who don't like their newer direction. <br /> <br />In sum, I really like this release, and I think that most fans will like it too. However, it is certainly a departure from all their other releases, even VT. To be honest, the only way you'll know if you like it or not is to have some faith in the band and buy it. You may be disappointed, as some here have been, but you also may be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />As far as how it \\"ranks\\" with other albums, it is too early to tell. For me, there is always a honeymoon period with every new Rush release,and it takes some time to put it in its proper place. I do know for a fact, that I do not think it is better than 2112, AFTK, Hemispheres, PeW, MP,Signals, GUP or Pow. I also know that (in my opinion) it is better than Rush, FBN, CoS, HYF, Presto, RTB and TFE. That leaves it somewhere in the middle with CP and VT. Not bad company. Overall, I rate it an 8 out of 10.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I found this album disappointing and sub-par.  On the CD jacket, the band writes that it took them 14 months to complete the album, the other two taking only 3-6.  What happened in those extra 8?  I have no problem with bands trying to go in different directions, but to completely abandon what made you popular in the first place is unacceptable.  Meteora hit you hard with the opening tracks and didn't let up.  Still one of my favorite alternative albums, this one didn't sound anything like Linkin Park.  The overtly political lyrics and slow soft beats and melodys left me longing for more.  I was expecting them to bring it hard in this album like they have in the past, and instead, they brought weak, poor songs that aren't even good by the standards of the genre of music they were trying to replicate in this album. <br /> <br />Extremely disappointing.  If you liked the last two LP albums, do yourself a favor and don't purchase this album...it will only change your perception of this once great band.
B00001ZWTT|3.0|good western/science fiction/comedy movie; some parts & language questionable for younger children, but overall a funny family movie

0767827902|5.0|The Last Picture Show is a film adaptation by Peter Bogdanovich of Larry McMurtry's novel of the same name.  The two-hour film follows Texas high school seniors as they graduate and move on to military service, college, or get stuck in the soon-to-be ghost town of Anarene.  Anarene is an actual ghost town in Texas, but the movie was filmed 8 miles to the north, in McMurtry's hometown of Archer City, which was fictionalized as Thalia in his 1966 novel.  The setting is evocative of many American small towns in the dust bowl during the Korean War.  In fact, Bogdanovich chose the name Anarene for his film version to pay homage to Howard Hawks' 1948 Red River, set in Abilene, Kansas.<br /><br />You can taste the dust and desolation as you view The Last Picture Show.  Two high school seniors (Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms) lust after the teenage temptress (Cybill Shepherd) and get advice from the old-time owner of the town's movie theater.  The young generation of Anarene residents is confused about their future and jockeying for position in the social strata, while the older generation feels the desperation of life in a dying one-horse town.  Reportedly, Orson Wells recommended that the movie be shot in black & white, and I can't imagine it any other way.  As a younger viewer, I was surprised by the amount of full-frontal nudity and sexual scenarios in a film nominated for eight Academy Awards.  It gives me hope to know that American cinema wasn't always as prudish as it has been in the recent past.
B00007K02F|4.0|Now I must confess that I have never read Jane Eyre (Athought I have brought the book a few weeks ago and plan to read it soon) so I can not comment on Whether it is faithful to Charlotte Bronte novel.  Athough I have seen the 1983 BBC Production, the 1997 A&E Production (borrowed from the Library) but this 1996 Production is the one that I really enjoyed the most and the only one that I brought.  The 1983 BBC Production was in my option made on a small budget. When you are watching it, one feels like they are watching a play. I really did not enjoy it at all.   The 1997 A&E Production was an improvement on the 1983 Production however Ciaran Hinds as Mr Rochester I did not enjoy. It seemed as many other reviews have commented he spends most of the production yelling and shouting at Jane.  But on the other hand Samantha Morton as Jane Eyre was likable. I think the main reason I could'nt come to enjoy and like this version is performance by Ciaran Hinds as Mr Rochester.   Now the 1996 production I enjoyed watching it so much so that I have seen it four times already and I only got the DVD from Amazon on Friday 18th May.  Franco Zeffirelli has done a wonderful job. From the cast to the locations to the costumes to the music. Everthing in this version was first rate.  I much perfer William Hurt performance as Mr Rochester. One can see that he is not a happy man and he is diffcult to understand but he does not spend the whole production yelling or shouting.  Anna Paquin is a great talent and she is amazing as the young Jane.   Charlotte Gainsbourg plays the adult Jane. From the three versions I have seen her performance was the one I really enjoyed the most and one could sense what she is feeling.  One of many scenes that I enjoyed was when Jane goes back to see her Aunt Reed as she is dying and requested to see Jane.   Jane offers her Aunt forgivness for all that she has done to her. She pulls away from Jane. Jane then replys \\"Love me or Hate me as you will,  you have my Full and Free Forgivness\\" What a prowerful message.    To the people that have not seen this movie I say make up your own mind about this Production and dont base you decision on other reviews. If I did that I would of missed out on something wonderful.  To the people that are looking for family friendly production. This is one of them but I think that your children need to be a certain age before they can watch it.   This is a clean movie about Adversaries, Love and Forgivness. I found this Production of Jane Eyre a very lovely sweet movie one that I am happy to have in my own personal collection.  I can not recommend this movie highly enough. This is a must have.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|At 13, LP changed my little life. I had depression, ADHD, violent parents, a lot of anger, and I almost committed suicide. As I was still trying to fall out the boy-band phase, my brothers and I were fortunate to hear One Step Closer in Dracula 2000, and we were hooked since. It was like our lives were a Broadway musical and every song was the soundtrack. <br />Fast forward 7 years later, and I got Minutes to Midnight. Okay, so they dropped a lot of the electronica, brought in sweetly sung ballads, (Oh Chester, is there anything you can't sing?) and even Mike Shinoda (as well as the other members) show more of their vocal abilities. A lot of people remain skeptical with their new sound,(and Rick Ruben) but I say this, weren't we scratching our heads when they first blew up the scene as well? Let it sink in. We've waited 4 years, I think it was worth it, and as long as their words still change someone's life, this album is mind-blowing, and there's nothing wrong with rennovation, especially if you're one of the most successful bands in existence. But, they could have still done great without the language. That I will agree with a lot of people on. <br /> <br />Fave Tracks: <br />Wake- Short but sweet. <br />Leave Out All the Rest- Did anyone else cry after hearing this? It made me think of my uncle. <br />What I've Done- Self- redemption theme, nuff said. <br />Hands Held High- Way too awesome for words. <br />No More Sorrow- Sounds like the same old LP to me on this one. <br />In Between- Man, Mike is a good singer as he is a rapper. <br />In Pieces- The instruments (I'm guessing one of them was marimba) used in this one was really gutsy (sorry, former band nerd) <br />The Little Things Give You Away- Did the metaphors in this one remind you of Hurricane Katrina? <br />
1582701709|5.0|This is a book written to open peoples eyes.  To open peoples ears. What is written is not new, but in the book it has a name and the thoughts/ideas/beliefs are in one text book. One could call this a way of life, some could call this spiritual, some could call this religious.  It will fit into any frame of mind, as long as you are willing to be open minded, and want to truly create your own world. The author makes the reading easy, and the quotes from noted people interesting. You can read it in a day, but you will want to keep it forever.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I watched part of this series when it aired on the Discovery Channel.  The cinematagraphy blew me away.  This particular series uses the original David Attenborough narration which I prefer to the Sigourney Weaver version.  I highly recommend this dvd set.  I can't stop talking about the series to all my friends and family.  Well worth the money!
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|If you see this film for no other reason, watch it for the dazzling cinematography.  You can't help but be swept up into this magical world and wondering how such a fantasy could possibly be real.  If you enjoyed The Princess Bride, Secondhand Lions, The Wizard of Oz, and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory you are sure to enjoy Big Fish.
B000001FDK|5.0|Listening to the music from Grease brings back the good memories of watching the movie. The music is funny (Summer Nights; Beauty School Dropout; Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee; Greased Lighting), touching (There Are Worse Things I Could Do; Hopelessly Devoted To You) and very 70's (Blue Moon; Rock \\"n\\" Roll Is Here To Stay; Born To Hand Jive). John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John sing great, but the supporting cast (Stockard Channing, Sha-Na-Na), also contribute to a good sound. Great rock and roll!
B00005JPAO|5.0|I purposely did not go to see this movie in a theatre and waited for the DVD so I could watch it in the privacy of my home away from the distractions of other people. <br /> <br />I was greatly moved by it.  The Queen was shown to be alone in her position.  I wasn't sure how the story would be handled, but it was done well.  Helen Mirren certainly deserved her awards. <br /> <br />I've watched it only twice, but will again when the mood strikes me. <br /> <br />I'm a royal watcher since the 50s.
B00065MDRW|5.0|RIGHT BACK TO THE EARLY 70'S.  WAY AHEAD OF THEIR  TIME. SOUND LIKE COULD <br />HAVE RECORDED YESTERDAY.  HEY KIDS!!!  THIS IS REAL  ACID  ROCK!!  ROCK ON!!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Of course, everybody thought Rocky should have stopped a while ago, but this movie is pretty good. Anybody who's aware of their own aging (more than on a cursory level), especially an aging athlete will relate on some level to the movie. It's pretty well scripted, classically \\"Rocky\\", and just generally well done.
0385333846|5.0|one of the best authors of his time. everyone in america should read this book, especially in our current times. Kurt had a real idea of what the world is like and puts it to page so beautifully and with such a great wittiness that it makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time, but you don't do either because it has so much truth to it. please read all his other works as well, they make you a better person.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I love this DVD. The Richard Donner cut is an absolute must-have for any Christopher Reeve fan. It is amazing how much unreleased material actually existed. This movie is like watching a completely new Superman film with Christopher Reeve in it. I much rather prefer seeing Marlon Brando as the lead parent figure than superman's mother. Marlon Brando adds a whole new tone to the film. The final theatrical version has better sound effects and more devastation scenes whilst this edition has plenty of fine dialogues that were cut out and some pretty good fight scenes, also cut out from the final version. Superman destroying the fortress of solitude is the key scene in my estimation. I don't see how that ended deleted for the final version. Extras on this dvd are nothing special, but the film itself is worth every cent. I will watch this edition over and over.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Yes, I have been a RUSH fan for over 20 years. Some reviews of their work are a bit harsh and picky. If you are a listener then you know that they have changed their style over the years. I think that's the reason they're still around aside from enjoying their craft. I have loved something about every album. My favorite is the underrated and dynamic HOLD YOUR FIRE. This new album, in my opinion, is their best in a decade. After the initial playthrough some tracks stood out more than others but eventually I was singing melodies in my head. I haven't done that in a while. The album is textured and a bit smoother than VAPOR TRAILS. The two minute guitar solo called HOPE is a treasure. THE MAIN MONKEY BUSINESS aside from having a great name is a fun and driving instrumental. FAITHLESS has flavors of GHOST OF A CHANCE and is a beautifully written song. Overall, the best power trio has graced us with another thoughtful collective work. Thanks guys.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This isn't like they're old stuff.  I've been a die hard Linkin Park fan sense day 1 and have been waiting for this CD for a long time!  People are complaining b/c its not their old stuff,i understand that, but people need to see they're evolution as a band and how they have \\"grown up\\".  Linkin Park is a great band and if they keep progressing like this more and more people will appreciate what they can really do, and more than just hard rock mixed with rap.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|Im going to be honest here. The album starts off strong with two good songs.. Sleepwalker and Washington Is Next, ..i start to get excited at this point and im thinking wow, this is going to be great, well that didnt last long.. then we get some hits and misses in between yet still consistently good impressive guitar then closing with Burnt Ice. The guitar solos, the music, its all excellent. Then in between its good music but it dosent have that special 'something'. Every album was flawless from the point of Peace Sells all the way to Cryptic Writings. 'I didnt even mind Risk', so im not being picky here. Those albums had a sound that melded together perfectly and every song was amazing. I cant say the songs here were all memorable. When i heard the song 'A Toute le Monde' it kind of had me wanting to go listen to the album Youthanasia instead. The remake was awesome but it had me reminiscing about the work of art which was 'Youthanasia' and saying to myself, what happened to those days? Im not trying to bring back a Megadeth that once was and I understand that they somewhat have evolved as a band and have a slightly new sound but I couldnt help thinking that. This album had a 'Rust in Peace' sound yet it didnt have those huge hits like 'Holy wars' and 'Hangar 18'.  As always the lyrics are very intelligent, political and prophetic but I almost felt like he was overdoing it a bit. Throughout the whole experience of listening to this album i was thinking it was a solidly good album and sounds like something you would want to play if you were going to war with the enemy and wanted to kick some ass. Its hard for me to form an opinion on this one because it was so good yet it was missing that special something at the same time. If you want to listen to a good metal album get it but dont expect a masterpiece. Im glad they havent thrown in the towel and i still look forward to every album they come out with. As long as Mustaines there im willing to listen. I would recommend this despite everything else.end this despite everything else. <br />
0316010669|1.0|It really does dawn on you somewhere in the middle of the book that Gladwell's intelligence is somehow borrowed, his examples redundant...He IS pushing his brand, his intellectuality, never quite making a solid point. The book is full of \\"deep\\" hmmm moments that never really amount to anything substantial. I'm glad I had the library copy (it would be a sorry waste of money). <br /> <br />The moment I read about the involuntary subconscious association with the DOMINANT race, I knew Gladwell can't be taken seriously.
1591841666|4.0|Very interesting book !<br /><br />Like most self help or motivational books this book does not tell us anything which we havent heard or read before but the manner and delivery that Seth Godin uses is very interesting.<br /><br />The book on its own is a light read and should be done in 3 hours only.<br /><br />Good light read and definitely a lesson in effective writing.<br /><br />Update (May 28th 2007):<br />The 4 stars are for the writing style and not for the content or the philosphy portrayed by this book. Like I wrote earlier, if you read one good self help book you 've read them all.
630469654X|5.0|This was a great movie, it has romance, action/adventure, betrayal and love, and of course, Matthew Broderick's smart mouth.  The scenes with Rutger and Michelle were tear jerkers.  I think they did a great job with the casting.
0515141429|3.0|I confess that this book had me interested from page 1, the gimicky short sentances worked for the narration of Jack Reacher, drifter and superhero. <br /> <br />The story moved action movie fast, (the final battle certainly has John Woo slo-mo gunfight written all over it) and partly that helps distract from the terrible plot holes and contrived meetings and coincidences that drive nearly all the main events.  If this had happened in any other town but Margrave, Georgia, Jack Reacher would still be in prison, not starring in further novels. <br /> <br />As an former military policeman, given training no other MP on earth has ever recieved he wanders into a web of murders and conspiracy just as it starts to unravel, and by sheer blind luck manages to win through. <br /> <br />Coincidence as primary plot device is seldome satisfactory, but its here in abundance.  The good guys make all the right guesses (including the absurd guess of the alias and hotel one character was staying at, just by knowing the characters music tastes...) and the bad guys, despite being ruthless killers make all the wrong ones.  Things just \\"fall into place\\" a little to readily here.  <br /> <br />Somehow, Reacher, a drifter and primary suspect in the first murder of the book wins over the cheif of Detectives and can get away with killing and stashing bodies all over the place, vigilante style, and the two good cops (one he is sleeping with a scant few hours after they meet) could care less, he's only killing bad guys.  He's not deputised or anything, and just because he doesn't have a criminal record they give him a tacit \\"007 licence to kill\\" and be involved in every step of the investigation, civil liberties be damned. Of course the number of people who survive to go to trial is...well that would spoil it. <br /> <br />I am a former Military Policeman with a spotless criminal record, and I am reasonably certain that a double digit body count even in the smallest town in the south, howerverwell deserved and motivated, would get me in trouble. <br /> <br />None of the townspeople on the take EVER call their family and tell them to move to Margrave to get free money?  Big crime coverups on this scale never work, and one this blatant certainly would have come apart sooner. <br /> <br />One or two elements, fine, but when you add it all up and then toss in Jack Reacher as the ONLY person who manages to figure anything out (MP work rarely reaches the level of investigation that the Boston PD Detective would have seen, so his sheer efficiency is a little out of place) the whole thing turns out to be reposterous, but still a lot of fun. <br /> <br />

B0007Y08IS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, however, it's not suitable for children.  The sex scene is outrageous!  I found North Korea's Kim Jong-il's dialog to be insanely funny!

B000MNP2KI|4.0|The newest entry into the James Bond series probably has the least in terms of cheeky, double-entendre humor and voluptuous femme fatales, but it has the series' trademark action jacked up to current blockbuster standards and a Bond that goes deeper into the iconic character's psyche. Although director Martin Campbell steers the 2006 movie with often breathless pacing and popcorn-level aplomb, it does feel too long at 144 minutes, especially in the last half-hour or so. Some set sequences, while mainly thrilling, feel downright endless like the construction site chase and the collapsing Venetian villa.<br /><br />Fortunately, as the latest 007, craggy-faced Daniel Craig is a charismatic enough actor to sustain interest over the running time. Physically, he cuts a convincing figure as a roughneck agent, though the camera seems overly preoccupied with showcasing his chiseled physique. Not since the young Sean Connery in the role's first incarnation has an actor so successfully redefined the role within the contours of his own screen persona. His natural intelligence and piercing blue eyes bring a surprising soulfulness to the more dramatic scenes, and his roughhewn manner resuscitates a Bond more befitting of Ian Fleming's original vision of a hungry agent intent on proving his mettle.<br /><br />As usual, the plot is impossible to describe without going into detail, but suffice it to say it involves an underground banker named LeChiffre who engineers terrorist attacks on companies in order to short sell their stock. It culminates into a high-stakes poker game (the driest sequence in the movie) and a few necessary deceptions. Written by Neil Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, the story feels more substantive this time and less reliant on pyrotechnics in place of character development, probably because the filmmakers were intent on remaining true to Ian Fleming's source novel ([[ASIN:0141187581 Casino Royale]]).<br /><br />Judi Dench shows up again as the authoritative M, and her role has surprising heft within the story. The other surprise is that the main Bond girl, Vesper Lynd, is also more substantive and complex than usual, although Eva Green plays her in a relatively pallid manner despite the advance. For once, the Bond villains seem as persecuted as Bond himself with Mads Mikkelsen playing close to the vest as the creepily scarred LeChiffre. The two-disc 2007 DVD set unfortunately has no commentary track on the first disc, though the print condition and audio quality are pristine. There are three featurettes on the second disc, including a thoughtful profile on the Bond girls.ritative M, and her role has surprising heft within the story.

0385340559|3.0|...but not bad. Read the other reviews for the plot, but Reacher is getting more contrived lately. Early in the series he had no special mental skills (he always hs has physical ones). In The Hard Way, Reacher always knows to the minute what time it is - and that became necessary for him to survive the action. In the current novel, Reacher has a near-savant talent for arithmetic - and that becomes necessary for him to surive the action. in the next book, we will probably find he is clairvoyant. No, it's not that bad - not really bad at all. Just not up to the earlier stories.<br /><br />The only other criticism I have is that this is a pure revenge novel. Only very late in the game is there a need to mount an operation to save anyone. The rest of the time is spent planning for, and carrying out Reachers squad's version of justice. There was never any moral second-guessing in this novel. Reacher's squad planned murder from the start.
1591396190|5.0|This is definitely my top-rated business book this year. The authors present a clear case for creating a market space in which competition is irrelevant and they give us practical exercises to help us. I have already used Blue Ocean Strategy with a couple clients and find it to be a great tool for moving through the \\"talk\\" stage of ideas and into execution.
B000OCXFCO|2.0|I became an instant Megadeth fan back since Countdown to Extinction.  I LOVE Youthenasia, System has Failed, and Cryptic Writings.  I've even seen them a few times in concert.  Their sound is classic Megadeth, however the lyrics make this CD less than stellar.  Although there are a couple good songs on this CD, Dave forces his messed up political views to a point where it is forced.  So much, that you feel silly listening along.  Although he has always had political views in his music (which makes Dave great), he just rambles in this one.   <br /> <br />Once again there are a couple good songs, but this is definitely a forgettable CD.  I am hoping a few more listens of this CD will help change my opinion, but not likely.
0793518326|5.0|My son's copy of The Beatles - Complete Scores was borrowed by one of his high school teachers when he was using it to give her young daughter guitar lessons.  He graduated and went off to college without getting it back (it was well-worn anyway), so I recently ordered a new one on Amazon! He found it invaluable when learning to play himself---actually taught himself with this book! It's something to keep forever!!!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|For all Beatles fans, LOVE is a must buy.  Lest you think that it is just another Beatles anthology, think again.  Listen closely, with  headphones if you have them, and become mesmerized by the genius and loving care of Beatles longtime producer George Martin.  He has re-mixed all of the songs so that you will hear the Beatles music in a totally different way; it will make sense once you listen.  You will find yourself playing it over and over again.  For those who are not Beatles fans, it is still worth exploring for the work of art that it is.  \\"Come Together right now\\" and buy LOVE.  You will love LOVE!!!

0375704027|5.0|What's it like to be a Japanese teenager?  What's it like to be be in love with your best friend's girlfriend?  What's it like to become, ever so briefly, a character from the mind of Murakami? As gorgeous a writer as he is, this novel is not over the top, remaining sublime in its magic - preferring to remain in the realm of the ordinary and explore the mind of a confused boy tossed between conflicting emotions.<br /><br />After reading Norwegian Wood I took a long walk with my dog and savored the experience of reading such an examination into the humanity that resides within the modern Japanese society emerging in the 1960's.  A lot of people believe that this story was autobiographical, but Murakami himself claims the entire tale to be fictional and the only autobiographical borrowing is the experience of living in a University Dorm Room in Tokyo.  Despite that denial, I completely bought into the realism of motivation and action, believing this to be a story in which every piece fit together so perfectly because the plot is character driven and the characters are believable.<br /><br />Toru Watanabe is a young college student whose best friend, Kizuki, committed suicide, leaving everyone behind to pick up the pieces.  Kizuki's girlfriend, Naoko, struggles with her own tenuous grasp on sanity, choosing to admit herself into a specialized Sanitarium.  Of course Toru is in love with Naoko and therein lies the central conflict - what does Toru do to fill the longing in his heart for a girl who is in love with her dead boyfriend and is falling apart because of it.<br /><br />The sadness is palpable.  The emotion wrenches from the reader, layer by layer, all of the defenses until the reader is raw and wrecked just like the characters.  I love the way Murakami handles sex in his novels - not picture perfect and sensual in the ways of romances, but odd and awkward and loving and sometimes twisted, just like in real life.<br /><br />I don't believe I'll ever get tired of Murakami novels.<br /><br /> - CV Ricked of Murakami novels. <br /> <br /> - CV Rick

If I spend $70 on a HD DVD, I expect 5.1 sound. In all other regards this DVD is amazing, though there are numerous parts where there is video noise that is very distracting.
0714844659|5.0|This is a delightful book that operates on a number of levels. First the exquisite photographs capture the beauty of the mundane doings of the Rose Bakery. From the simplicity of a zested lemon to the ruddy faces of the apple suppliers to the delivery truck to the ooh so chic client&egrave;le, the pictures transport the reader to this Paris cafe.<br /><br />Then there is the author's story, a tale of a woman who loves food and people.  With no formal training and a belief in natural, fresh and unpretentious dishes, Rose Carranini built the wildly successful business. Her sense of purpose and commitment to quality and sustainability is impressive and her affection for her patrons is palpable.<br /><br />Finally, the recipes themselves are superb.  Basically, there are two types of people:  those who follow recipes to a tee and those who view recipes as a guide or starting point for their own creativity.  The author advocates the flexible approach.  She encourages the cooks to use their favorite ingredients and substitutions, cautioning that it is the method as opposed to the ingredients that is crucial to the ultimate success of the recipe.  She correctly points out that cookie cutter results are impossible when using natural ingredients...the juiciness of a piece of fruit, the humidity,the weather, the rainfall or lack thereof, the temperature of the room all impact the final result.  The amateur cook should not be deterred.  While some of the recipes are a bit labor intensive, they all are fairly easy.  Additionally there are plenty for vegans and vegetarians.<br /><br />The author embodies the joy of cooking.  Food should  be fun not fake.  Her secrets are all revealed...always buy fresh, seasonal and local; use organic and sustainable when possible and remember the most important ingredient is love.

B000OCXFCO|5.0|Enough said. It's the best Megadeth effort in my opinion. It doesn't win top honors by a lot but it does receive them. I don't know what some of the negative reviewers are listening to but what I hear is a timeless metal album. I had no idea this album was going to be this good. I'm so happy Dave made this wonderful masterpiece that I will enjoy for years to come like PS, RIP, and CTE.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|He is absolutely the best singer to come along in a long time.  It is nice to be able to hear such wonderful music by such a great singer.  I only wish he was appearing near so I could go see him in person again.  He absolutely puts on the best show ever, and really treats his fans well.  Way to go Michael.  God Bless You.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|While I agree with people that this album steers away from the classic LP sound I completely disagree that it's a bad thing.  This is most definitely the best thing LP has ever created. It is mature, and very relevant to modern times which shows that they've grown as most of their fans have in the last 7 or 8 years... Also just wanted to mention that Shinoda kills it on Hands Held High. Thanks.
B00068NVI4|1.0|Poor recording, wimpy performances, bizarre editing and goofy graphics at the the beginning of each song made this DVD a real bust.  I should have taken to heart a similarly dismal review by another purchaser before I bought this disc.  I'm sorry to have to say this about one of my favorite groups of all time, but, they should be embarrased for letting this disc be released.
B00030IZY0|5.0|My wife and I have also looked for this on DVD for years.  We have 2 copies of it on VHS and still play it whenever we have a house full of people and someone has not seen it.  Like \\"Stop Making Sense\\" it never misses.  The Rick Derringer led band is great and energetic and it is obvious that they are having a good time on stage. The songs are from her first two solo albums, so they are the songs that everyone knows.  (She has continued to put out good albums and if you liked the first two you should check out the others).  Everyone is dancing in our living room by the encores which includes a killer cover of Jackie Wilson's \\"Baby Workout\\" that really shows off Cyndi's pipes. After that workout we frequently rewind to \\"Maybe He'll Know\\" (from her Blue Angel album) and play the last half of the concert again. The second time we let it go to the final encore - an acapella \\"True Colours\\" that Cyndi turns over to the audience midsong.  It's a wonderful way to wind down and get back to real life.  A friend told us he thinks the cracks in our plaster ceiling are not from the several earthquakes the house has endured since 1926, but rather from our raucus Cyndi parties. <br />Our tapes are both in good shape, so we will continue to wait for a domestic DVD release from the master tapes.  But we are tired of waiting.
B000MV9026|2.0|S. Nay's Spotlight Review, entitled Nothing Happy about \\"Happy Feet\\", is right on the money. Their list of issues is nearly identical to mine. <br /> <br />There's only a couple of things I would add. <br /> <br />Why did the Adelie penguins speak with a heavily urban Hispanic accent? Of all that made no sense in this film, that reigned supreme. (You also might wonder why Lovelace has a name like Lovelace when others have names like Ramon. And why, if all they give him is pebbles, is he so fat?) <br /> <br />Penguins with heavy English or Scottish accents (the elders of the Emperor penguins) were closed minded idiots. <br /> <br />You can't have multiple accents in a film - especially when one accent represents blindness, the other open mindedness - and not be making a comment. Yet I'm perfectly certain that the producers of the film were NOT making any kind of social commentary whatsoever based on the distribution of accents. That's what makes it so puzzling. <br /> <br />That and Mumble's name (the other Emperor Penguins had \\"normal\\" names), and his blue eyes - again, something that no Emperor Penguin shared - that used to be cute when Elijah Wood was a child actor but are either mesmerizing or freakish, depending on how you look at them. <br />
0767802659|5.0|One of the best modern classic sci-fi action movies ever!!  Hot babes, giant intelligent bugs, carnage, destruction and down right fun...what more could you want.  One of the best movies to bring to the big screen the \\"feel\\" of watching a comic book.
B00005JPFF|3.0|Spider-Man 3 is everything that its predecessors were not. In other words, where the previous two were shining examples of great movies made from comic books - especially the second - this was not. In the event that anyone ever wonders again if more villains means a better movie, SM 3 should provide the definitive answer: NO. The problem with making a movie with three villain is that you can't ever properly focus on one of them, which then means that unless they're united as one with a common purpose (as in Superman 2), you're left with plot strands and story arcs that intersect and some are left hanging while others are explored. You *forget* that there's something else happening - or, if you don't forget, you wonder why you should care.    The special effects, it should go without saying, were fantastic, and the high production standards and solid acting were what lifted this from being a very, very bad movie to an entertaining one. In the hands of a lesser director, and certainly without the big budget, this might have been the cinematic equivalent of used coffee grounds.    But even so, there were times when I laughed aloud in the wrong places. For example, Spidey encounters his dark side in this film, and much has been made of that in the previews, so much that I don't feel the need to say much more about it. When Peter first saw his dark side, we got a glimpse of that with Maguire pulling his hair down in front of his face in a pseudo goth style (had it been longer). He didn't look like he was in a moment of magnifying his dark side; rather, he looked silly. The film's exploration of Spider-Man's and Parker's dark side delved no deeper than the black suit he wore for a bit. And it was, well, lame. My roommate thought that the film was trying to be funny during most of it, and they probably were. In that case, it truly beggars the imagination. I hope they were trying to be serious, because if anything Maguire was doing while wearing the black suit under dark clothes and messy hair was supposed to be taken seriously, ouch. It didn't work.    Another friend commented that he wanted to channel Tom Hanks from A League of Their Own and remind the filmmakers that \\"There's no crying in comic books!\\" Of course, there is, but there was far too much of it in this movie, with little believability to back it up. There was far too much down time - i.e., time where nothing of consequence is happening - for a film with a budget of some $258 million dollars.     Still, I found myself entertained. True, I was quite pleased when the film ended, but I wasn't pulling an Elaine from Seinfeld when she was watching The English Patient with Peterman, squirming in my seat and wanting to get out at any cost. That was likely due to, as I mentioned above, the high production standards.

B000000YIQ|5.0|This album is routinely mentioned as a classic and one of Sonny Rollins's best.  For whatever reason, that acclaim doesn't translate into the same popularity attained by Saxophone Colossus.  Nevertheless, if you like Sonny Rollins's playing or jazz from the mid-to-late 50s then you should definitely put this one in your shopping cart. <br /> <br />Sonny was one of the big innovators of the saxophone trio format -- saxophone, bass, drums -- and this was his first recording with such a lineup.  Getting rid of the piano has several implications.  The first is that the harmonies become a lot less obvious to the listener without the piano banging out the chords every few seconds.  The second is that there's a lot more pressure on the musicians --- particularly the saxophonist, but also the bassist -- to generate interest without using piano solos as a crutch.  There's a lot more space to be filled in, and in the hands of lesser musicians this space would turn into gaping holes. <br /> <br />Fortunately, Sonny Rollins is one of jazz's greatest improvisers.  The fact that he doesn't have to share solo space with a pianist on this recordings means he can let loose some brilliant, unfettered and uninterrupted improvisations.  There's a LOT of Sonny's playing on this album.  Sonny's notorious for the humor/wit in his playing and there's a ton of that here. <br /> <br />Sonny's companions on this date for Contemporary Records were bassist Ray Brown and drummer Shelly Manne.  Manne was one of the premier drummers on the west coast and appeared on a lot of Contemporary sessions.  Manne wasn't a \\"power drummer\\" like most of the drummers that appeared on Sonny's east coast recordings (Philly Joe Jones, Art Blakey, Elvin Jones, and Max Roach).  That means that he's content to be an accompanist rather than an almost equal partner a la Max Roach. <br /> <br />The compositions offer a nice amount of variety.  \\"I'm an Old Cowhand\\" is the kind of semi-cheesy tune that Sonny specializesat transforming and gives the album a great start.  \\"Come, Gone\\" is just straight-up fast bebop.  \\"Solitude\\" and \\"There Is No Greater Love\\" are intense ballad performances.  \\"Wagon Wheels\\" is a medium-tempo jam, and \\"Way Out West\\" closes the album on a jaunty note.  The overall mood is more mellow and introverted than Saxophone Colossus; the album was recorded in the middle of the night, so this is not surprising. <br /> <br />One annoying thing about some versions of this album is that the alternate takes are placed in the middle of the album (immediately following the masters), destroying the album's original sequence.  I recommend looking for the now-out-of-print 20 bit remaster or any other version that places the alternates at the end of the album, where they belong.  The alternate takes are actually fascinating to explore once you get to know the original album, as two of the tunes are given much longer explorations. <br /> <br />This album is highly recommended and an essential part of any collection.  If you like Sonny in a trio format, other albums to check out are A Night at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note), The Freedom Suite (Riverside/OJC), and East Broadway Rundown (Impulse!).  I'm probably forgetting some others.  And of course, if you haven't heard Saxophone Colossus, be sure to pick that one up.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I've owned every Linkin Park album ever made, including a couple of their LP fan club send outs.  I was always at the store ready to buy it on launch day after discovering their first CD.  This time was no different. I bought the CD/Video set and soon realized that I should have just downloaded a song here or there off Itunes.   <br /> <br />When I opened the insert, the first page had a paragraph talking about the growth of the band and how each one stretched beyond what they were used to.  I thought this could lead to some pleasant new sounds but once again, I was dissapointed.   <br /> <br />The first song if you can call it that was nothing special. I would have preferred it to be a Mr. Hahn creation as some of the previous CD's have contained.  He makes brilliant compositions and really has material that fits an ending track.  Never should a 1 minute intro be considered a song so this CD has 11 true tracks.   <br /> <br />The second song. Well its aggresive and heavy Chester vocals.  I've always respected Linkin Park for not throwing in swearing on their tracks.  For the most part Linkin Park managed to get their point across with clean language. I'm not against swearing, it does not offend me but I respected them for making a quote once that they felt it was not necessary in music.  Well they threw that out the window with this song throwing the f word in all throughout.  Again, I'm not offended by this, just dissapointed they felt they had to take this route. <br /> <br />The rest of the songs until minutes to midnight can be called fillers. They probably will never make the radio or become hit singles. As others have mentioned there are ballads and there is one Mike Shinoda rap.  What it seems they have done is almost tried to fuse Fort Minor with Linkin Park. This whole album sounded like something Fort Minor could produce and I think Mike Shinoda has a large role in that.  My fiance had commented how much she likes the new album because it sounded like EMO.  That's when I really became disgusted with the CD.  This whole growth thing and trying new sounds was a huge mistake.  It's possible to grow without completely changing musical styles. <br /> <br />Minutes to Midnight is good and probably the only single that will be a hit.  It's the closest to the old Linkin Park that the listener will ever encounter.  It shows that somewhere, the band still has its old sound.  After that, its once again more fillers. <br /> <br />The last track is nice. It's not true Linkin Park sound, but it does have a nice catch to it and the harmonization is well done.   <br /> <br />In the end, I call this CD a huge bust. They claim they had over 100 songs to choose from.  I say find some of those 100 that sound like the old Linkin Park and put them into a new CD quick.  They really risk losing their core fan base on this CD unless they can get back to the sound they used to play with.  The first CD was some of the best music they have put out and it created their first fans.  Artists seem to think they need to tinker and toy with everything as they go.  I don't understand why something that works needs to be changed. <br /> <br />If your a hardcore fan, buy the CD simply to support Linkin Park in hopes they will create something better.  Otherwise, find some tracks you like and download them.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I'm not a music critic, have no vocal training and am not here to compare Mr. Buble to anyone else or this album to any of his prior recordings.  All I can say is that I enjoy this album immensely.  \\"Meglio Stasera\\", \\"I'm Your Man\\", \\"Comin Home Baby\\", \\"Lost\\", \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\" and \\"Dream\\" are exceptional in my opinion.  These make me want to sing along or get up and dance!  Love the richness and depth of his voice.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|At the denouement of this film, I believe I had just seen the only film that had left me speechless EVER. I couldn't watch another movie for quite some time afterwards. I don't even know if I could watch it a second time, which is meant as a compliment...it might take me a few years to get over watching the incredible ending.<br /><br />I frown on thinking that Hollywood might 'steal' this film (remake)...it is WAY too intense for Hollywood.<br /><br />I consider myself a rather jaded movie watcher; I've been able to watch movies other people have considered unwatchable, but this really is in a special category. I couldn't ever imagine seeing anything like this on the big screen...it would be *way* too much for me.

B000FTWB7G|3.0|This is about a three and half star CD.  I love their first CD \\"Fallen\\", which was quite originally.  It was a breath of fresh air to hear \\"Fallen\\".  But it would seem that once Brian Moody left the band and well....several other people as well(about a year or two later).  Each musician brings their own style of playing an instrument and singing.  You can't change that no matter how hard you try.  I mean yes true bands can like Red Hot Chili Peppers.  But that's kinda rare to see and to find(if there's another band like this tell me. Metallica doesn't count since Red Hot Chili Peppers went through about ten different people before the line up now).  I have to say, starting a band is like starting a family business.  And if one person doesn't do their job the business will fall or not be the same. <br /> <br />And I feel that I can see(or hear in this case) the major change in this band.  All the original band members are no longer in the band.  I'm not bashing the album completely.  There are good songs on \\"The Open Door\\".  But I wish Amy Lee could of mixed up a little and stop trying to re-create her first album.  \\"The Open Door\\" actually didn't sell as much as the debut album.  But that's just a side note. <br /> <br />I felt like I was listening to song for 45-60 minutes.  There was no change in the line up.  But I got to say the song \\"Snow White Queen\\" is one of the best songs on the album.  And some songs I feel like Amy Lee just picked them off the first album and rearranged the lyrics.  Like \\"Lacrymosa\\"  kinda sounds like \\"Whisper\\" from the Fallen album.  Maybe it's just me.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I love LP, and loved the single of this album, What I've done. It's not like anything else of theirs, it doesn't have as much rap/rock combinations that they normally do. I love this cd, its not what you would expect but they did push themselves to the limit on this one and it worked, Rick Rubin and Mike did a great job producing this album. If your a LP fan, get it you will not regret your purchase,if your not an LP fan still get it, the lyrics and music tie so well that you will find yourself dancing, singing along and doing a little hangbanging along with the music. The only thing that could have made this album a little better would have been maybe one or two songs with the beats, rap and vocals, (i.e. In the end, numb).
B000M341QO|5.0|great movie, really enjoyed the plot.......  so suprised at the end of the movie!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Now, that's a roadtrip.  Kenny Wayne got to meet and play with the masters and we get to hear the sessions.  This is a must CD for blues fans. Six of the performers on this CD including Gatemouth Brown have passed on since these sessions were recorded and some of these cuts are probably the last they've done.
B00005ASIL|5.0|It's excellent for any Tull Fan---Ian Anderson put together the tracks himself; what he considers the best of the best
B00005JPFH|3.0|My arachnophobic husband never wanted to go, so I went with a friend. I'm renting #1 and #2 and I'll probably find out just what I missed.  I know superhero films are going to be full of CGI, but so many morphing and melting characters villains got tiresome.  The jazz club scene was cute, but just that--I could have seen it as an extra on the DVD and been amused, but for the most part it detracted from the main storyline at a critical point.  <br /> <br />This was a fun film to see larger than life on the screen, but I'm not sure Spiderman 3 would translate well to anything but a very high-end home theatre system.
B00000AFWW|5.0|As emotionally drained as any Courtney Love shenanigans can make us, she is foremost a musician and this is her and thus her band's greatest achievement in a relatively short list of recorded music. Ditching the complete garage grunge angst of Pretty On The Inside and Live Through This, Courtney and company brought Billy Corgan in for a couple things and went to California for inspiration. Conjuring up images of the 70s California rock scene, Courtney left a lot her angst in the Northwest and went for more melody. I love every single song on this disc and when it came out I played it over and over - from the beginning guitar crunch and Courtney's vocal \\"oh make me over/ I'm all I want to be\\" the title cut breaks into the catchy yet dramatic \\"Awful\\" followed by \\"Hit So Hard\\" and it goes on and on with a radio friendly tune thrown in before crunching into the pain grunge we love from our Courts... so much better than her ill fated (and I wanted to love it) solo album from a few years ago - for those unsure of Hole's reasons for success and with an ear more for melody than angst, this is the CD to go to. <br />
B000O178BY|5.0|This may be, dare I say, almost as good as Downward Spiral.  I'd prefer more soundscape, less vocals, but that's just my taste.  The album still rocks after many plays -- should hold up well through time.
B00005AXEL|4.0|God bless this crazy witchy woman - I have loved every single thing this woman has ever done and I'm not alone. Along with legions of fans, Courtney Love, Billy Corgan, Natalie Maines, Sheryl Crow have all talked about her influence and in most cases recorded versions of her songs. Trouble In Shangri-La was her \\"comeback\\" album if you will, her first since 1994's ill fated Street Angel, which though it had all the mystique of Stevie was lacking some of the raw passion we have come to expect from Stevie. Well, that wasn't the case with this album which included Crow singing on \\"Sorcerer\\", Maines singing on one of my favs - the country twinged \\"Too Far From Texas\\", plus beautiful and poignant lyrics of the first single \\"Everyday.\\" This is one album I can listen to (and did when it came out) over and over and over.... <br /> <br />
0738702994|3.0|I bought this deck, sortof on impulse one day. <br /> <br />When I got it home and looked through the cards, I really really liked the images on them.  <br />They miss some of the key symbolism, but that's fine with me (a little). <br /> <br />But, I'm not all that great on Welsh mythology, so I couldn't help but feel I was missing a lot with this deck by not knowing who they were talking about. The titles were also just generally distracting...  <br /> <br />I ended up giving it to a friend whose much more into the myths than I am, and she likes it, though they don't like her too much yet.  <br />
B00004XQP4|5.0|I am in love with Billie Joe and always have been. From the first moment he sang to me about being a slacker whose only real motivation came from jerking off, well let me say he had me at \\"Longview.\\" After numerous albums, all equally fun and brilliant Green Day released Warning: in 1998. I haven't really stopped listening to this CD since. I put songs from it on everyone's mixers, I put it in my car stereo and jam as I run the streets of LA, it has not lost one single iota of power for me. The singles \\"Warning\\", \\"Minority\\" and \\"Macy's Day Parade\\" are brilliant. The album cuts are just as powerful - from the first song to the end, all I can do is sing, sing, pound my fists, sing, sing. I love it! Now to the naysayers i realize that perhaps Green Day isn't doing anything those other power punk pop bands are doing but they were doing it first and they do it better. With Warning: they were really saying something and doing it with such fervor I almost have to do a longview on my self .. Excellent album - buy it! Billy needs your love and support, not as much as I want to give him MY love and support but whatever. <br />
0811826848|5.0|The only negative is the size of the book.  There should be a smaller hardcover or paperback edition.  The content is superb and a great coffee table book, but it's difficult to curl up with this book in bed.
0312330529|5.0|If you haven't heard about this book, you need to get it and read it.  Of course the scoop right now is that Johnny Depp has purchased the rights to the book and along with Mira Nair, is going to star as the leading character, with production starting later this year.   <br /> <br />Gregory Roberts is a consummate story teller and not only is there great action but this is a wonderful love story.  The love of India and the love of a special woman go hand in hand in this tale.  I was hooked from the first paragraph.  It's a long book, 911 pages, but they fly by.   <br /> <br />Having been to India via the same airport and the having experienced the same smells and physical sensations Gregory describes really sucked me in.  Check out his website for lessons on writing your own stories.  Also check out Shantaram-themovie.com for information on the film.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|I wish I had watched it before I bought it.  In that it is fairly realistic so I'm told by guys who were there it dull and boring and mostly pointless.  If you are looking for action go some where else.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This new album from Neil's vast archives is so beautiful and when Neil talks to the audience it's a real thrill to hear him speak.  He was so young, but even then a really deep human being.  Was he ever not just an awesome person?  These songs are clear and the sound is top notch.  I have played it over and over.  I love Neil Young!   <br /> <br />Check it out!
B000N3ST8O|5.0|This CD/DVD is truly for a Stevie Nicks fan. All great songs and plus having the videos from her songs is a extra plus !!! A must to have !!
0060755598|5.0|I have totally changed the way I view my small business after listening to this CD set.
0553804367|5.0|This book is a great introduction to theories that are a critical and integral part of our everyday lives. The author does an excellent job laying out the theories, the problems with them, and the current train of thought and how the theories work or don't work.  Hawking also leaves things open and writes the work so as to enable the readers to be able to want more, while still understanding what has been presented.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is an amazing video-it could not be better. Great information, beautiful video, the entire family (including college kids) enjoys it!
B000OCZ0ZO|5.0|This is truly an amazing album, not for the pretend fans though that bash it because they tried something different. This album is for fans that are open minded, and can appreciate all kinds of music, as long as it is quality.  If you are close minded, you may want to stay clear of a purchase until you have heard it first.<br /><br />With that said, this album takes three listens: one to get you over the initial shock of the change, another to get you deeper into the meaning of the music, and then the third to realize how much you love the new music.<br /><br />Song breakdown:<br /><br />Wake: cool intro, great way to start off. 5/5<br /><br />Given Up: One of my favorites on the album. The best Chester has ever sounded vocally; great song! Has a punk feel to it, which is not a bad thing at all. 5/5<br /><br />Leave Out All The Rest: Mellow song, but not bad. This sounds like another single; it is a soothing ballad with clean vocal talent and great musical accompaniment. The lyrics to the song are absolutely inspiring; well worth checking out. 5/5<br /><br />Bleed It Out: another favorite; you can tell through the music and live performance especially how much LP loves this song (they smile the whole time). No one can argue against the rhythm and greatness the track offers. 5/5<br /><br />Shadow Of The Day: takes a full listen to enjoy it (don't skip after ten seconds). Really cool string section and guitar work. Absolutely AMAZING song; reminiscent of U2's \\"With Or Without You,\\" which is also an amazing song. At first, this song is shocking to an LP listener, because it is so different from the other material, but this song is one of the best ever to be recorded. 5/5<br /><br />What I've Done: good song, but not the best on the album; took a few listens to get into it. Even though this sounds closest to their previous material, it is not my favorite track. Still, it's a great song. 4/5<br /><br />Hands Held High: I love this song; if I could give more then 5 I would; it;s deep, powerful, and Mike's talent never ceases to amaze me. The band's choice of instruments and vocals are genius. Beware: politics! 5/5<br /><br />No More Sorrow: Arguably the heaviest track here, and it's great. Really solid intro, heavy music and lyrics, fantastic vocal delivery. If you dislike political messages you may not like this track, because it is a Bush-basher, but politics has never made me like a song any less. 5/5<br /><br />Valentine's Day: This song is kind of blah, not a personal favorite. It does grow on you though, and it does fit into the album's sound. Overall, the song is enjoyable. 4/5<br /><br />In Between: cool song, but does border on being boring. Music is great, but I like a little drum beat in my music; this song lacks that. The song could be construed as emo-esque; Chester definitely wrote the lyrics from his heart. Toward the end it begins to redeem itself, and it ends up being a worth-while track. 4/5<br /><br />In Pieces: another favorite for me. Really cool song, just listen all the way through. Ska guitar, guitar solo, and great vocal delivery. One of the best on the album. 5/5<br /><br />The Little Things Give You Away: starts off slow with weird sound effects and acoustic guitar. Kinda of weak at first (hate to say that), but after a minute, the track turns for the better. The drums really stand out for me in this track, as well as the rest of the musical accompaniment. This song is really well done, and the end is chilling. The harmonizing by Chester and the band sounds great, as well as the music behind it. This has turned into my favorite song, as well as the best song ever done by them. It is incredible! 10/5<br /><br />No Roads Left (itunes bonus track): really cool song. Mike is singing, and actually singing this time, really well, unlike in \\"In Between,\\" where his voice is very down-played. The song should be on the regular release, but what are you gonna do? Cool violins, guitar work and great vocal range make this track worth the itunes download. 5/5<br /><br />Overall, this is a five star album, with a wide range of music and talent. The band has never sounded better, and I look forward to what they make next, hopefully in less then three years. I hope you find this review helpful in determining whether or not you should buy this album. I will say this also; I was not a \\"die hard LP fan\\" before this album. I have always enjoyed their work, but I never considered them in my top five; this album has pushed me to the other side, and I can personally say they are now my favorite band, as of right now.<br /><br />If you look at any of my previous reviews, they are not nearly as extensive, so that should tell you that this album is important to me. The music is deep, and well worth the money. Buy this album, and congratulate Linkin Park on their success for changing for the better by clicking \\"Yes\\" for the helpfulness of this review.<br /><br />P.S. For all of you expecting Meteora pt.2 don't waste your time here bashing this record with your negativity. You are close minded, and are not open to new things that differ from the past. Hybrid Theory and Meteora were exceptional, but I would not be happy if Minutes To Midnight sounded like those; that genre has died slowly, and they know it. Don't bash this record because it's different; embrace the changes and see the beauty in the music.
B00008FRNJ|5.0|where do I start on the King of pop? the man Changed Music as we know it period. everbody that comes after him is in his Musical Debt. He took the best of the Past and created his whole style of music making and creativity. He is a Musical Genius.  this Album represents the best in so many styles of Music. hard to believe it's been 25 years. WOW the time sure flys.  where do I start::<br /><br />Wanna Be startin somethin: the Groove and I call it the Jump beat vibe is Classic MJ. His vocals and the Background Swing era call and response and then the trademark classic  ending are what classic songs are all about.<br /><br />Baby Be Mine: this Jam hits so hard and soulful and you can make the argument that this Rod Temperton classic was a Pre-Cursor to New Jack swing on the Groove and those classic MJ vocal runs. still sounds so fresh.<br /><br />The Girl is Mine: middle of the road track featuring two Musical Icons and it works.though it still sounds milk toasty to me,but it worked in setting the album into Motion.<br /><br />Thriller:the instrumental element of this track moved me more,but the video made this track for me more than anything else. it fits into Michael Jackson stylings as a Artist.<br /><br />Beat It: the song that truly broke Racial barriers on MTV and also on Top 40 Radio back in the early 80's. the teaming of MJ and Eddie Van Halen never gets it's full due but it paved the way for a Run DMC and Aerosmith on 'walk this way\\" and other Rap/Rock Hybrid teamings.  Michael jackson's voice really sounds strong on this classic. the programmed drum Beats sound New and have a freshness about them.  MJ was on to something<br /><br />Billie Jean: Arguably the Greatest song Ever. easily the best song of the 80's no doubt. what made this song so great? was it MJ's vocals? was it the Bass? was it the Drums? was it the Story-line? was it the Chrous? was it the Groove or synths?  how about all the above and thensome. and Motown 25 when Michael set himself in motion and took off His Legend truly took off. that moment back then in 1983 is still the Single Greatest Musical Performance on TV that I have ever seen. timeless.<br /><br />Human nature: this song is Jazz. and the build up and emotions felt on this track still will melt you with the ease of Michael's vocals and timing.  still so smooth and dreamy.<br /><br />PYT(Pretty Young Thing): a tough dance groove of a Jam that had the smooth Mackness of Michael's vocals and the background vocals were on point.  the Main Writer of this song James Ingram Provided the Groove which he also used on carl carlton's \\"she's a bad Mamma Jamma\\" and played the bulk of the instruments on that cut. the same Groove is basically re-cycled here but Producer Quincy Jones adds his trademark Elephant african voicings on here.<br /><br />the Lady in My Life: what a way to close a classic Album out. a smooth slow jam which has MJ laying it out there. very smooth and timely. the arrangements are all on point..<br /><br />the Team of Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones,  were unstoppable.<br /><br />but  the Artist Himself Michael Jackson changed the whole World of Music.

B00003CXC7|1.0|Alfred Hitchcock made approximately zero good movies in his life except maybe The Birds, which I liked a lot.  But most of his movies, including and especially Rear Window are just two hours of people sitting around talking about suspenseful things.  I know because they're old these movies are supposed to be so great, but you can't tell me that Rear Window is as exciting as a movie like Disturbia!!!  I guess you can tell me that, but I don't plan to listen to you.<br /><br />Here's what happens in Rear Window:<br /><br />No, I didn't make a mistake in that paragraph.  I was proving a point that nothing happens (by leaving a lot of blank space after the colon).  It's a movie about Jimmy Stewart sitting in a wheelchair and watching real action happen through binoculars.  Guess what, Alfred Hitchcock?  Maybe it would have been a better movie if we had been watching whatever was going on in that other building and not wasted our time watching the guy who was watching all the cool stuff go down!<br /><br />That would be like if Steven Spielberg decided to make E.T. a story about a scientist in a lab coat who does nothing for 2 hours and then at the end he gets to poke and prod a little alien fella for about a second.  Hey, Steven Spielberg: thanks for not making that movie!!!<br /><br />Anyway, Rear Window is not recommended for the young or the young at heart, but maybe for the young at brain.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Buble is a big fan of Tony Bennett and it's easy to see why. This guy is an incredibly strong singer as the material on the album will attest. Each of his albums are increasingly improved. He starts off swinging with 'The Best Is Yet To Come' and doesn't let up until the beautiful 'Dream' or if you get the album with the bonus track, the old Nat 'King' Cole tune 'Love'. He has some fun with 'It had better be tonight' which in itself is worth the cost of the disc. Magnificent album by one of the best jazz singers.
B000002JSP|5.0|first, zep is one of the top 5 rock bands of all time, in this reviewer's opinion. though this, their last album, is not representative of the sound they forged in their earlier albums, in my opinion it is still a classic. <br /> <br />\\"in thru the out...\\" finds zep in a mellower mood, perhaps because they had matured, perhaps because of things happening in their lives, perhaps due to other musical influences [the advent of synthesizers, for one]. who knows. but this album still contains all the elements that made zep great -- the inimitable celtic-blues howl of robert plant; the masterful dynamics and production that marked all their work; the amazing rhythm section of bonham and jones; above all, the wide-ranging brilliant blues rock guitar of jimmy page. the songs still are primarily about love, loss, want and regret. and just the joy of rock n roll. <br /> <br />the texture of the music is still almost orchestral in its tapestry of sounds. the guitar playing, though more restrained, still runs the gamut from hard simple blues chords to intricate screaming solo's. the final two songs -- all my love and i'm gonna crawl -- end the album on a majestic, bluesy and masterful note. the latter in particular sounds like it comes the first decades of rock, but for plant's weary vocals and the powerful climax.
B000NA28I4|4.0|In the land of Alagaesia, a 17 year old farm boy named Eragon goes out early one morning to hunt. Out of no where appears a shiny blue stone the size of a large watermelon. He takes it home with him and at first tries to sell it to a local vendor. The vendor realizing immediately this is something King Galbatrorix (John Malkovich) will want to kill for will have nothing to do with it. Eragon takes it home and hides it in the barn.<br /><br />What Eragon doesn't know is he has been chosen by an elfin princess who sent to stone magically to him to keep it away from the evil King. Shortly after hiding the stone, which is really one of the last dragon eggs to exist, it hatches before Eragon's eyes. What emerges is a beautiful blue dragon which quickly grows up to become a very large dragon. A dragon that read his thoughts and communicate telepathically with him. Her name is Saphira (Rachel Weisz). She tells Eragon she's waited 1000 years to be born to the right person. Her rider. Him.<br /><br />Eragon learns from the local storyteller named Brom (Jeremy Irons) that the land used to be filled with dragons and their chosen riders. They were the peacekeepers. Even the King use to be a rider. Over time greed inhabited them and a civil war broke out killing what they believed to be all the dragons and most of their riders. Brom who was also a dragon rider carries much guilt about this battle. He takes it upon himself to mentor the boy who has also inherited the magic that comes to every rider.<br /><br />Eragon starts off as an arrogant boy who acts prematurely. Brom tries to instill in him to be wiser with his actions because a rider will live if the dragon dies but if a rider dies so does his dragon. And the evil King knows this also which puts Eragon's life and that of his dragon at stake. At the moment his biggest hurdle is the malicious wizard, Durza (Robert Carlyle), sent by the King to kill Eragon, and finding the Varden Rebels who went into seclusion after the age of dragons.<br /><br />I felt all the actors did an exceptional job. I even enjoyed Jeremy Irons who I've never been especially warm to. The dragon special effects are a highlight to be sure. Saphira is magnificent and blue! The movie is listed as containing violence and mature themes but I didn't find it nearly as violent as Narnia or Lord of the Rings (both of which I loved). In some instances the relationships did feel sped up causing a loss of connections but the real characters are the dragon and her rider. Eragon ends with one battle over only to lead the way for another. I sense a sequel. This movie is based on the book of the same name by Christopher Paolini and is part of a trilogy. I have not read the books but after seeing the movie and checking out the \\"spanning time\\" feature on the official website I'm putting them on my wish list.

B00005JPCF|4.0|Does a moving message, dazzling photorealistic animation, lots of Broadway-style dance numbers and a non-stop parade of catchy pop songs make up for a near total inability to tell a story? Well, almost.<br /><br />\\"Happy Feet\\" is plenty entertaining, but it's certainly not light on its feet. Trying to teach that it's OK to be yourself while simultaneously promoting the dangers of commercial marine harvesting while also telling the story of a little lost Antarctic penguin who travels to, apparently, Orlando's Sea World and back is, let's face it, a lot to cover in a children's film, especially when it's packed with Beach Boys, Prince and Stevie Wonder songs whose lyrics have nothing to do with any of those things.<br /><br />However, the movie does work on some levels. Your kids will identify with Mumble, the film's outcast lead character who eventually wins over his peers, and the top-tapping dance numbers are so catchy they make the movie easy for parents to sit through. (By the way, Mumble is plenty cute and cuddly, so you might well load up that shopping cart -- Amazon sells [[ASIN:B000EPFFTW Happy Feet Dancing Mumble]], [[ASIN:B000ETRG2M Sababa Happy Feet Mumble's Tumble Game]], even [[ASIN:B000EPFFZ6 Happy Feet Mumble Dress-Up Outfit]].)<br /><br />Overall, the film is a good companion to [[ASIN:B000BI5KV0 March of the Penguins (Widescreen Edition)]].<br /><br />The bonus features aren't bad, either. A five-minute video offers a serious tap-dancing lesson from Savion Glover, whose moves were used in the film. Completed just for this DVD, a touching extra scene features the late \\"Crocodile Hunter\\" Steve Irwin as the voice of an albatross, urging Mumble to \\"enjoy life while you can.\\" \\"I Love to Singa\\" is a classic 1936 Warner Brothers cartoon that features a once-famous Al Jolson/Cab Calloway song (\\"I love to singa! About the moon-ah and the June-ah and the spring-ah!\\"). And there are two catchy music videos. Cute dancing penguins fill the frame throughout Prince's \\"Song of the Heart,\\" which is impossible to watch without cracking a smile. Also fun is Gia Farrell's \\"Hit Me Up,\\" a live-action dance romp that is not only a cut above typical teen pop, but refreshingly bootie free.impossible to watch without cracking a smile.

1582701709|5.0|I originally read this book because it was associated with inspirational on Associary.com. After reading it all I can say is wow. I think if you put your faith in the pages of this book, great things will happen. In this way, it's almost like a religion...
0786891084|5.0|Cecelia Ahern is now my favorite author! I was skeptical of the format for this book, so I put off buying it. I've read every one of Ahern's books and this one did not disappoint. I LOVED it, it's a great beach read. I've read all of Aherns books on various vacations and they are perfect for long plane rides and long lazy days at the beach. The first page of this book hooked me, I was laughing out loud. My favorite is probably still P.S. I love you, but it was almost my first Ahern read. If you are looking for an entertaining, page turning, girly book this is it!
B000NVIGC0|2.0|I'm a Wilco fan. I bought \\"Sky, Blue Sky\\" the day it came out. There's been a lot of good ink in regards to this cd and I had hoped it would be a step up from \\"A Ghost is Born\\" (which had the disadvantage of following \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\") but it just isn't. Right now I'd say it's a step down. I'm not going to tear this cd apart because Wilco is a great band and should be allowed to struggle and falter. Simply, the main problem is that it sounds like they just couldn't find any inspiration with these songs but decided to release it anyway. They just don't have the clever, well-crafted, ingenious \\"x-factor\\" that marks the bands best material.    I will say that now, more than ever, Wilco seems to really be The Jeff Tweedy Band. That might not be a such good thing. Wilco might need a little give and take, a little tension added back into the mix to fuel the creative juices.    This is a 2 1/2 star cd. It won't stop me from buying their next release.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Helen Mirren gives a complex and sympathetic performance in this well-written and performed movie about Queen Elizabeth's reponse to the nationwide grieving over the death of Princess Diana. In retrospect, the massive mourning over Diana seems excessive and silly. The Queen's initial reaction of having a private funeral was the right choice but the crowds were insane - making much more of Diana than she deserved. In my opinion, the Queen was not out of touch - the British people were - so dazed by a foolish celebrity culture that they were no longer rational. Yes, Prince Philip comes off as stupid - most of the Royal family are. The Queen, however, has conducted herself with a great sense of duty and faithfulness to her people. Unfortunately, in the weeks after Diana's death, rationality and intelligence were difficult to come by. This movie is what many of us crave - an adult drama free of special effects and comupter generated aliens. The actor who plays Tony Blair does an equally excellent job.
0743201140|5.0|This is an insightful look at personal development.  After reading this book, I realized that I have expended a significant amount of time and effort to \\"improve\\" weaknesses and have only gained minimal improvements.  These weaknesses are still weaknesses.  This book recommends instead that you maximize your strengths which makes perfect sense!
0596527055|5.0|(review of 2nd edition - 10/03/2010)<br /><br />\\"Innovation\\" is a word that gets used so often in marketing hype that it seems to have lost its meaning.  Scott Berkun sets out to reclaim the word and offer up a true definition in his book The Myths of Innovation.  I found this book so compelling while reading it on my iPad that I ended up figuring out how to do highlighting as there were many points I wanted to remember and ponder.<br /><br />Table of Contents:<br />The myth of epiphany; We understand the history of innovation; There is a method for innovation; People love new ideas; The lone inventor; Good ideas are hard to find; Your boss knows more about innovation than you; The best ideas win; Problems and solutions; Innovation is always good; Epilogue - Beyond hype and history; Creating thinking hacks; How to pitch an idea; How to stay motivated; Research and recommendations<br /><br />One of the reasons this book resonated so deeply with me is due to my view of how people add importance to events that weren't critical at the time.  For instance, a particular battle may be touted as the turning point of a war, and a commander's decision a brave and ingenious move.  But the battle could have just as well been lost, no one would have written it up, and some other potential outcome would have decided the war.  We seem to think that the outcome we received was the only possible course, and that's incorrect.  Quoting Berkun: \\"Yes, when we look at any history timeline, we're encouraged to believe that other outcomes were impossible.  Because the events on timelines happened, regardless of how bizarre or unlikely, we view them today as predetermined.\\"  I'm glad to see that Myths fights back against this common belief.<br /><br />Looking more directly at innovation, Berkun reveals another myth that bugs me to no end. \\"The dilemma is that, at any moment, it's difficult to know whether we're witnessing progress or merely, in a hill-climbing distraction, a short-term gain with negative long-term consequences.\\"  We can't know how things are going to turn out, and there are far too many examples of ideas and \\"innovations\\" that were found out later to have horrible long-term effects.  DDT, anyone?<br /><br />Just one more example that caused me to do a \\"yes!\\" when I was reading... We attach major significance to objects that, at the time, were common.  The Rosetta Stone is thought to be one of the most significant discoveries and artifacts ever found.  But the text on the stone is nothing but basic, everyday communication to the people of the time.  It would be like someone discovering a piece of our junk mail 1000 years from now and declaring it a significant piece of 21st century communication.  Yet at the time, we throw it away.  Because we look at the Rosetta Stone as enabling us to decipher ancient languages, we tend to revere the stone itself.  But it's really just a common thing that happened to survive the centuries, and we've attached significance to the item that wasn't intended when it was first created.<br /><br />Berkun goes on in the later chapters to help you understand the true nature of innovation, as well has how the process of getting and developing ideas is available to any of us.  Coming away from reading Myths, you should understand that innovation is hard work, it's not a single event, and your ideas build upon the ideas of others.  In addition, what you think your idea is good for and what actually happens to it could be two entirely different things.  When the first HTML page was built and put on a network for sharing, no one could have imagined what the Internet would end up becoming.<br /><br />The Myths of Innovation is a top-notch read, and one that you should plan on revisiting often...<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Publisher<br />Payment: Freeces.\\"  We can't know how things are going to turn out, and there are far too many examples of ideas and \\"innovations\\" that were found out later to have horrible long-term effects.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|After seeing an onslaught of negative and indifferent reviews here, I felt obligated to write and try and even things out. Minutes to Midnight is, in my opinion, Linkin Park's best album. The band tackles a larger variety of styles here and really pushes their boundaries. The musicianship has definately improved, with the addition of actual guitar solos, better drumming, and just better songwriting. It is obvious that the band has grown and wanted to do something different. I applaud this. Come on people let's face it Meteora was basically a continuation of Hybrid Theory they were so similar. The songs were interchangeable.  <br />     I am very satisfied with the job Mike did on this record. The rapping is strong when it turns up but I've never been a big rap fan anyway. I really like the track where Mike actually SINGS. Also, each track is noticeably unique. I was getting tired of the same simple, clunky, guitar riffs. Brad's technique is much improved here. <br />     All in all, M2M is a change for the better and I personally hope the next LP cd follows this direction.
0783114893|5.0|Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) is a normal guy, just trying to stay awake behind the wheel of his car (well, it's not really his, but he's delivering it from Chicago to San Diego). After a near-death experience w/ an oncoming semi, he decides to pick up a hitch-hiker named John Ryder (the incredible Rutger Hauer). Ryder soon reveals himself to be a psychopathic serial-killer, intent on adding Jim to his long list of victims. Jim manages to escape Ryder's clutches, only to trigger an insane game of cat and mouse, psycho-style! Halsey must try and survive Ryder's vengeance, while eluding the police. With the help of a girl named Nash (SWF's Jennifer Jason Leigh), Halsey stumbles into one horror after another! The movie's multiple climaxes had me chewing my nails 'til my fingers bled! Hauer's John Ryder is pure evil, even scarier than his sociopathic replicant character in BLADERUNNER! A classic villain! Highly recommended...
B000MCIBE8|5.0|It was the summer between my sophomore and junior years in High School.  An adolescence spent listening to Top 40 Radio was gradually giving way to early adulthood.  With a growing maturity also came a realization that there was more out there than the Beach Boys, Beatles, and the Dave Clark 5.  A music style that had given teaser previews with a few Yardbirds, Animals and Kinks hits exploded onto the music scene with the driving Rock and Roll, musicianship, and guitar tones of Jimi Hendrix, Cream, the Who, Steppenwolf, and other groups.  I was eating it up, forgetting about Top 40 forever.  No more AM radio for me, FM was where the good stuff, the music with guitar tones, solos, attitude and extended versions lived.    I remember sitting in my parent's room as the first echoes of CCR's \\"Susie  Q\\" insinuated themselves into the night.  The song exploded into its agonizing distorted guitar solos, and I wondered, who the heck is THAT?  How can they be so good on the guitar?  Is there more of this stuff?     Of course, the answer was \\"yes\\", and I have never looked back.  A great summer, that, with musical experimentation blasting out everywhere.  I ate it all up, buying \\"underground \\" records up everytime they appeared.    Some of the albums from those days sound dated, and are unlistenable except for nostalgia purposes.  Other offerings still stand tall, and some  still blow the competition away.    I heard about the Doors from a friend, and of course bought this first offering from the band.  \\"Light My Fire\\" was a monster hit, but I owned the album for all the songs, not just the circus-like hook of the organ on the featured song.  Good as that song is, it is only tied for maybe 6th place on the record.  \\"Break on Through\\" is the first cut, and the near manic vocal by Morrison, over a driving rhythm and great lyrics, sets the tone for the album.  Also on display is that strange, otherworldly quality to the tone and feeling of the album, a staple of Doors music.  It'shard to describe, but other fans know what I'm talking about.    The album contains hard core rockers, like the aforementioned \\"Break on Through\\", as well as blusey numbers like \\"Back Door Man\\".   \\"The End\\", an 11 minute play, caused a sensation with its story about a killer that awoke before dawn, killed his family and raped his mother.  Things like that just didn't appear in media in those days.  \\"Alabama Song\\" is a drinking song, but I bet everyone can sing along with it.  I've read in several places that the Door's next album, \\"Strange Days\\" is better, but don't you believe it.    Morrison has a big voice on this album.  He hits the notes with power and presence.  Ray Manzarek showed star power on the keyboards, backed with solid, powerful drumming by John Densmore.  Robbie Krieger hits some nice licks on the guitar.  In concert, Manzarek played bass with his left hand, on another keyboard.  Larry Knechtal is often credited with doing the studio bass work on this album.    No matter who backed him, Jim Morrison was going to be a star.  He hit the music industry at the right time, with a stage presence, lyrics, looks and voice that were going to propel him into the absolute upper reaches of the Rock and Roll stratosphere.  This album rocks like no other Door's album, as close to pure Rock and Roll as they were ever going to get.  It is a truly great album, not only for its content but its impact on the industry.  Going on 40 years now, and this one is still one of the very, very, very, best albums ever made.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Great addition to my library.  Many popular hits as well as a few that I've never heard.
B00000F14B|5.0|An excellent classic movie musical with an excellent story line. There are significant comedic instances and areas of plot to make this interesting for any number of audiences. The score itself is worth owning this edition. It is an entertaining movie from start to finish and the rousing ending brings it all together.
0679720200|4.0|I read The Stranger when I was young but didn't really get much out of it.  I recently reread it and was struck by the lack of emotion on the part of the protagonist, Muersault.  Forget existentialist - this man was depressed.  He has all the hallmarks of it - doesn't care about anything, has no joy in his existence.  It doesn't so much bother me that he didn't care about his mother's death; she was older, apparently  not in good health and they weren't close.  But what does bother me is the casual way he deals with the murder he committed.  It seems almost beside the point- the man he killed had done nothing to Muersault justifying the murder.  More than anything else, his flat attitude reminded me of the murderers in In Cold Blood.  There were some serious mental health issues that this man had.

0634022296|5.0|My 20 year old son loves to play the guitar and like his father he is a big fan of the Beatles.  My husband and I checked out a number of different chord books, Beatles and mixes, and we decided on this one.  My son is thrilled.  He was excited to start and said it is a great book to learn the chords, fast and easy.  He sounds so good which I guess is a combination of him and the book!

0321344758|3.0|This is a fast read about making good Web sites. I agree with just about everything Krug says, and it's nice to hear him say it. Most of what he says is (or should be) common sense. However, there are so many web sites that violate his advice that it must not be common sense. <br /> <br />Read the book, just don't expect any profound insights. Maybe you don't need profound insights to make a good web site.

B000002GY9|4.0|A little scat, a little be-bop, a little blues--but all Tom Waits. For fans of the singer's more recent works, this CD will take them back to the strip clubs and night life described in his earlier songs. It took me a while to get acclimated to this album, but now I like it just fine.

0446678430|4.0|Like other author's book, this one is also easy to follow, a good bedtime read. Unfortunately like other books it lacks more specific detail on the subject although it is present more here then in the other books. <br /> <br />The whole series is a good eye opener but author would do all of us a favor if he would make all of it into one book.
0060007737|5.0|Ries and Ries wrote a great book.  I must mention that I am not in marketing or public relations yet found this book incredible and interesting.<br /><br />Inside this book is 22 Immutable Laws of Branding and also a bonus book on Internet Branding.  I think people in any industry should read this.  I really think this book is great for small business operator.  Each chapter covers examples of success and failure from huge companies such as Budweiser, Holiday Inn, Xerox, etc.  You don't need to be the founder of the next Microsoft to find this book useful.  22 Immutable Laws Of Branding has important lessons that anyone could use for success in any size business.<br /><br />This book is very well written and makes you laugh at times.<br /><br />Ries and Ries are insanely knowledgable on branding and it shows through this book.
0307275639|5.0|The Philadelphia Inquirer once wrote that \\"Mitch Albom's book is a gift to mankind;\\" however, this assertion could win an \\"Understatement of the Year\\" award. Albom's novel Tuesdays with Morrie is not only a beautifully written piece of literature, but essentially allows the reader to put his or her life into perspective. Written as a true account of the author's past, this novel depicts the reunification of Albom and his former professor and mentor, Morrie Schwartz, during the last few months of Morrie's life. Meeting every Tuesday, Mitch and Morrie turn their deep discussions into a final class on \\"the meaning of life.\\" Calling it his \\"final thesis\\" of the class, Albom's magical memoir, Tuesdays with Morrie, will captivate readers of all ages with its life-changing lessons that everyone can learn from.  <br /> <br /> This heart-touching story begins with a flashback of Mitch's graduation from college where his professor, Morrie, expresses his high hopes for Mitch's future. However, Mitch takes a completely different and unexpected road, trading his dreams of joining the Peace Corps for a heavy paycheck. Like the majority of people existing in the twenty-first century, Mitch becomes consumed with money and materialism; \\"wrapped up in the siren song of [his] own life\\" (33). After stumbling across an ABC-TV \\"Nightline\\" special on Morrie's journey to death, Mitch visits his old, dying professor and begins a \\"class\\" that influences his life forever. Studying topics including human emotions, death, money, love, and forgiveness, among others, Morrie's one-of-a-kind perspective on life is contagious as it forces readers to consider how Morrie's teachings relate to their own lives.  <br /> <br />     Insightful dialogue between Mitch and Morrie on these topics is what makes this novel one to remember. Although suffering from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Morrie maintains a humorous and optimistic outlook on life, conveying his embracement of death-- something that people have a difficult time doing these days. It is this attitude that cracks the stone wall surrounding the heart of the reader, allowing them to discover life's greatest lesson: \\"once you learn how to die, you learn how to live\\" (82).  During his last days, Morrie emphasizes that that love, above all things in life, is what allows a person to actually live life to the fullest. The simple diction of the discussions that they share suggests that the simple things in life make the difference between a manual life of fulfillment and a mechanical life of accomplishment. <br /> <br />     Mitch is ultimately transformed by Morrie's wisdom and dignity. His priorities of wealth and covetousness are replaced by those of generosity and kindness. Only after this \\"final class\\" is Mitch able to truly live knowing that envy, regrets, and pity blind one to the magnificent simplicities and emotions of life. Mitch writes, \\"Most of us walk around as if we're sleepwalking. We really don't experience the world fully, because we're half-asleep, doing things we automatically think we have to do\\" (83). Readers everywhere can relate to this statement, allowing them to question whether they, themselves, \\"experience the world fully.\\" A novel with a message this powerful has the ability to influence people, communities, and even the world. A must read. <br />
B00000K3D4|5.0|The Labyrinth is one of those childhood classics that you might dread to watch again for fear that the magic that once existed might disappear forever when viewed through the eyes of an adult. Although this is true for many childhood films, it is not so for The Labyrinth.<br /><br />The magical world of Brian Froud, made real through Jim Henson's direction and puppetry remains unchallenged over 20 years later. The inimitable creatures and characters that exist in the world of The Labyrinth; including Sir Didymus, the noble fox, who rides atop his canine steed, Ludo, the sasquatchian rock-caller, Hoggle, the begrudgingly friendly troll, and of course, David Bowie in the equally threatening and charming Goblin King.<br /><br />When Sarah, a young Jennifer Connelly wishes that her baby brother Toby (Toby Froud) be taken away by the Goblin King, she never dreams that it would literally happen. Now she only has a matter of hours to make her way through the labyrinth and reclaim her brother before he will be kept in the Goblin castle forever.<br /><br />The music is amazing, the visuals are unmatched, and the character voices are right on the money. This movie is perfect for anyone of any age at any time. If you haven't seen it yet I don't know what you're waiting for, and if you don't have it on DVD yet, well, here it is so stop reading this and buy it.
075640407X|5.0|This was a wonderful read starting at page one.  Most fantasy books have alot of war and 3 pages of sword fights then war again and on and on.  Not this one.  How refreshing.  And ones without all the war and fighting are very hard to come by.  This was one I could not put down.  I can hardly wait until the next installment.  A very nice story off to a great start.
B00006JU7T|5.0|Sidney Lument made a brilliant move choosing to direct Serpico. And executive producer Dino De Laurentiis made a brilliant move choosing him to direct it. This is the film that put Al Pacino on the map.<br /><br />With realistic acting and realistic actors - no makeup and flashy costumes and shots- Serpico has a gritty realistic feel that makes the story stand out even more than it would have otherwise. Al Pacino showcases his acting technique in the portrayal of a beleaguered New York cop who just wants to do his job. When he finds himself amidst high levels of corruption and money payoffs, he sets out to make it right. Unfortunately, the higher up he goes, he only discovers that the corruption is higher up than he could have thought.<br /><br />Time has been good to this film and it still shines over 30 years later as a superb police film and real-life dramatization. Frank Serpico is a hero in the true sense of the word: putting his own life on the line in order to stop corruption.<br /><br />The DVD package is great, and includes several special features including a making of featurette where director Sidney Lument talks about his quick and dirty directing style (and the fact that Serpico went from filming to theatre in only five months). There's also a short about Serpico himself, and the book by Peter Maas, that the movie was based on, as well as a brief short with Lument detailing his favorite scenes from the film.<br /><br />Don't miss this film if you want to see a monument of cinematic quality and Pacino establishing himself as a true star.
0761119752|5.0|We love this book.  It is so enjoyable to read with its sing song story.  My daughter really likes to hear it as we put her pajamas on and just before we shut out the light.  She lights up as soon as we open the first page.  She is 11 months old and has loved this book since she was 6 months old and I imagine she'll love it for years to come.
0151013047|3.0|Changez, a Princeton-educated Pakistani, sits at an outdoor café in Lahore, entertaining an unusually buff American (with the chest of a man who \\"bench-presses regularly, and maxes out well above two-twenty-five\\") whom he has just met that evening by relating his life story. Changez is the only voice we hear - the mysterious guest's comments and actions are inferred from the narrator's conversational responses. From the start, the American seems edgy and minimally engaged, seldom expressing himself, insisting on sitting, jacket on, with his back to the wall, and receiving oddly regular cell phone messages. <br /> <br />As the evening progresses, we learn about Changez's extraordinary career successes and personal relationship frustrations in the United States. An international student at Princeton, Class of 2001, straight A's, and a starting job at the renowned Wall Street business valuation firm Underwood Samson, the young Pakistani launches into the American Dream. Not terribly subtly, the author allows his narrator to belabor the business concepts of his new position, assessing true value and focusing on fundamentals, terms with all-too-obvious religious meanings. The personal relationship half of the American Dream begins at nearly the same time when he mets a fellow classmate and aspiring novelist named Erica. However, he soon learns that just a year earlier, Erica lost her soulmate, a friend since childhood named Chris, to lung cancer.  <br /> <br />The trajectories of Changez's life all point upward as he embarks on his professional life. After a stellar bout in his training class, he shines in his first assignment as well -- a valuation project for a record producer and distributor in the Philippines. His star also continues to rise with Erica, albeit Platonically, despite the nagging presence of Chris's ghost hovering over everything in Erica's worldview. The events of 9/11 cast a pall over New York, but Changez marches on, doing another valuation projectfor a New Jersey cable company. He barely registers the aftereffects on the American Muslim community while continuing his pursuit of the increasingly distant and troubled Erica, A brief trip home to Pakistan alters the arc of his life, and its effects are compounded by the experiences of his next valuation project, a book publisher in Chile. Changez now sees himself as a janissary, a paid traitor to his own people. He personally deconstructs the Western life he has built for himself, ultimately leading him back to a Pakistani university where he becomes an anti-Western radical leader.  <br /> <br />Author Mohsin Hamid adopts a clever narrative voice for this tale, using Changez's eyes and words to convey an ambiguous sense of threat about his American guest. Regretably, however, this ambiguity extends to the narrator himself. Too many of the story's actions feel undermotivated from that voice, up to and including the seeming threat posed by the mysterious American visitor. Rather than Saul on the road to Damascus, Changez's deep conversion seems trite: an airport scene here, a luncheon conversation there. One day a Princetonian Wall Streeter, the next day a radicalized university activist. Even his relationship with Erica and its ultimate resolution comes across as superficial.  <br /> <br />Curiously, Changez's fundamentalism appears entirely secular, absent the religious component we have come to associate with both Muslims and Christians. These elements could perhaps be seen as a commentary on a too-easily adopted set of beliefs, reflective of a shallow narrator. Is he really as radical as he thinks, and has his radicalism achieved such levels as to warrant the potential assassination to which he alludes? Or is he just as deluded now as he was on Wall Street? If the narrator is truly so superficial, his tribulations hardly serve the reader as a lesson about the formation of a radical fundamentalist (implied by the book title). In such a setting, the characters'very names begin to feel trite, a bit too convenient - are we really meant to read Changez as a variant of the English word \\"changes?\\" Is the dead Chris really Christ? Is Erica really America? Can it all be so simplistic? <br /> <br />On balance, THE RELUCTANT FUNDAMENTALIST is perhaps something of a literary confection: an interesting read, yet curiously light and unfulfilling given the gravity of its topic.  <br />
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I just want to say that this album is great. I agree that it's not Meteorea, but who wants to hear the same thing over & over again. Naysayers, you have to remember, Linkin Park are no longer a teenager Nu-Metal band.  Linkin Park have grown into one of the most unique, multi-influenced bands of the last ten years.  If you really listen to Meteorea, it's direction leads to this album, in my opinion, perfectly.  Fans of Nu-Metal, grow up.  Fans of great music, do yourself a favor & buy this album!!!
B00005JPLW|5.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE!  Not for the dialogue, but for the action...  It's just good old fashion mass fighting, with very, very, very muscular men...
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I know this isn't a great movie but it's really enjoyable and heartwarming.  Cameron Diaz is a workaholic who finds out her boyfriend is cheating on her.  She trades houses over the holidays with Kate Winslet, who's devastated when the love of her life announces his engagement.  Both women learn a lot about themselves in their new surroundings and fall in love.  Jack Black and Jude Law are terrific as the new love interests.  A really charming movie that I'd watch all over again.
0446528056|4.0|Poignant and eloquent story of a U.S. Army soldier, the woman he loves, and the father he doesn't understand.  This is Nicolas Sparks at his most sparkling.  He tells a story full of love and loss and growth and change.  These characters are three-dimensional and profoundly deep.  The situations were true-to-life and dealt with honestly, in true Sparks fashion.  This is a truly amazing book from an amazing writer!  For the number of years narrated within the pages, I'd almost consider this an epic.  It's a very fulfilling story.<br /><br />The audio book is read by Holter Graham.  His accent adds charm to the piece, although the female vocal characterization is a bit too masculine at times.
B000002G30|4.0|Dopes to Infinity is not their best album, in fact, it may be their least best.  I say that because it is an awesome cd, but when compared to \\"Powertrip\\", \\"Spine of God\\", \\"Superjudge\\", and \\"Monolithic Baby!\\", it doesn't quite stack up. It is more along the lines of \\"God Says No\\", where you really dig it (especially compared to most other bands), but there is just a certain something missing. There are some awesome songs on here, like their first big hit \\"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\\", \\"Look to Your Orb...\\" and \\"Dead Xmas\\". If you are fan, you must add this to your collection. If you are new to MM, then I'd start with \\"Powertrip\\", as that is their most well-known and successful cd, and the easiest to get into.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I didn't expect much from this film.  Bullock films tend to be either a hit or miss, more often miss, so it's understandable to be stunned when one catches you by surprise.  For the longest time, I kept hearing people question how they owned the same dog and to those I say \\"pay attention to the movie\\"-it explains Alex leaving the dog with Morgan and Morgan then giving the dog to his then girlfriend, Kate.  Reeves, a mediocre actor who has either the best agent in the world or a keen sense for winning scripts, gives a performance reminisant of \\"A Walk in the Cloud\\" and the results are just as sweet.  I was confused to how the bus incident could happen and upon second viewing, I realize that she couldn't save him until 2008 so then it all made sense and it's a definite winner in my book.  Highly, highly recommended.
B000MZHW40|5.0|There are some persons who may be naive enough to think that Africa really isn't like how it is depicted in this movie.  It is.  All these African countries are in constant states of war, civil war, military coups & general unrest.  Darfur gets a lot of publicity, but it is hardly the only place in Africa that is in crisis.  Genocide is pretty much the norm for most countries, and a perpetual state of chaos is commonplace.  Only place in Africa I'd like to visit someday would be Egypt to see the Pyramids.  However, that won't be anytime soon w/all this terrorist nonsense.<br /><br />  The cast of BD was excellent.  I've always had a crush on Jennifer Connelly.  She has gone from being a young pretty face to being a very accomplished actress (and she's still a pretty face!).  Djimon Hounsou has a very powerful screen presence (and not just because he is buffed up!).  As was the case in GLADIATOR and AMISTAD, he is able to convey a lot of emotion through very few words.<br /><br />Thankfully, for myself, I've never been into diamonds.  Never have bought one, and very much doubt I ever will.  For people who have indulged in diamonds, this film might be a shocking (and not so pleasant) eye-opener of where your diamonds actually come from.  In any case, it is truly a poignant film.
1591841666|5.0|I love books that challenge conventional wisdom, and give you a new way to look at things. Seth Godin's The Dip does exactly that. We've all been ingrained with messages like \\"Winners never quit and quitters never win,\\" and while it's true that persistence is important, there are times when persisting is a total waste of your time, energy, and money.<br /><br />The Dip isn't really about how to quit things. It's about how to strategically quit certain things so you can be the best in the world at other things. There's no way we can do it all, so we need to do what we do best and get rid of the rest. Godin illustrates this point with interesting facts about ice cream sales, marathon runners, and much more with his unique and punchy style.
B000O174CM|4.0|I LOVE this movie!  I saw it 4 times in the theatre.  The special features could have been better, but they do show Beyonce & Anika Noni Rose's screen tests. I wish they showed the screen test for Jennifer Hudson and more behind the scenes stuff.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I found the subject matter informative, focused and not pedantic. It was directed to things we can all get onboad with like clean air and water regardless of how you might feel about global warming. It doesnt dwell on the fact that we are responsible on some level for these problems but that we can all do something about the solution.  <br />As for Mr Gore, his presentation skills have improved dramatically. He is passionate about his subject and that has made all the difference. I personally think that in the past he was doing a job whereas now he is doing something from the heart and he would like all of us to join him. <br />
B000OCXMAE|1.0|This is without a doubt one of the worst albums I've ever bought. I love LP but this really is a turn towards what to expect in the future. <br /> <br />Why do bands like LP think that just because they are a big successful act they can experiment & pull off a miracle?  It didn't work for Audioslave or Metallica. <br /> <br />Save your money people & buy music from real artists like Iron Maiden who've been around & know how to actually write good music!
1416909532|3.0|A small pocket sized book that basically says if he doesn't call - he's not that into you.  <br /> <br />Some funny comments, quotes and sections though. Fun for a light read.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Deep Space Nine is by far my favorite series in the Star Trek franchise.  Part of it comes from the most interesting cast of characters, from it's tormented Commander Sisko to the fiery ex-terrorist turned liason officer Kira Nerys.  Station security is covered by Odo, a shape shifting alien.  And many other characters that make each episode fascinating. <br /> <br />Another thing that sets this series apart from other Treks is that it has large continuing threads that span most or all of the series.  While this first season doesn't even mention what fans would later know as the Dominion, it does give us a gateway to the other side of the galaxy which eventually leads to that arc.  And the major arc of Benjamin Sisko's destiny begins right with \\"Emmissary,\\" the excellent 2 hour series premiere. <br /> <br />This season has fewer memorable episodes than later seasons, with forgettable ones like \\"Move Along Home\\" taking up a lot of space.  But it does have it's moments.  The previously mentioned pilot episode \\"Emmissary\\" is the finest series premiere in the franchise.  Near the end of the season we have \\"Duet\\" one of my favorite episodes of dramatic television ever and is a major step toward the character growth of Kira.  Then the season ends with \\"In The Hands of the Prophets\\" a nice politics/religion story about the clash of 2 very different cultures present on the staion that nicely sets up season two's opening arc. <br /> <br />Extra's on this set are very nice.  Several featurettes on the making of the series as well as an in depth interview with Nana Visitor, the actress who plays Kira.  There are also ten hidden short featurettes on the final disk.  Can you find them all? <br /> <br />
B000OCXMAE|4.0|This is a very different sounding Linkin Park than the first two albums. It took me a few spins listening to the disc, but now I actually like it...a lot. There isn't too much Mike S found on this disc, and where he does appear I'm not so sure it sounds very good. This whole disc is very very slow. Missing is the hard rock....still a good disc in my opinion though.
B0006J28BO|4.0|This movie follows the staple storyline for many Studio Ghibli films...a young girl enters a magical realm and in the process learns about herself and/or helps others. <br /> <br />This should be enjoyed by all ages. <br /> <br />One note though on the translation of the title into English; the Japanese title \\"Neko no Ongaeshi\\" should translate into something like \\"The Cat(s) Return(s) a Favor\\" or \\"The Gratitude of Cats\\".  I'm not sure why they chose just \\"The Cat Returns,\\" which implies that a cat goes away and then comes back, which isn't the story at all!
B0002PZVH0|5.0|No one does Airport music like Eno, and if that's what you're looking for then you can stop looking.  This early electronic music music is just so, perfect for a mellow background level while working or if people are over or if you want something louder, just turn it up.  The best, and just as good as his music for Films.
0755331451|5.0|This book, like her other books transports me back to that time and place so it feels as though I am a part of that moment in time.
B000O178BY|4.0|this is the best NIN since downward spiral.  im not gonna talk bad about the album...but i fell in love with NIN because of the \\"soundscape\\" they created with downward spiral, broken and fixed.  i was lost in the albums, they were another world...the type Clive Barker describes in his books.  although it is a great album, one i listen to from begining to end, it doesnt create the same atmosphere.  i do recommend it...but look towards borken and fixed for the real NIN!
6304936362|5.0|...is to realize that, although no single plane and crew experienced everything that's shown happening to the Memphis Belle in this film -- and certainly not on a single mission -- nevertheless, everything that is shown undoubtedly happened to many, many planes and crews during the long bombing campaign in the European theater. To watch this movie is to get a small taste of the fear, tragedy, and triumph experienced by those brave men (and boys). <br />Several years ago, I stood in my back yard and watched a vintage P-51 Mustang (the \\"little friends\\" of this movie) roar overhead at low altitude on its way to an air show at a nearby airport. I was stunned at the raw power of that 60 year old aircraft, which made today's small Cessna-type aircraft seem like mosquitos in comparison. Watching \\"Memphis Belle\\", I couldn't help but feel that the 40s were in some way the peak of manned flight. Today we have supersonic or hypersonic flight, and are beginning to see pilot-less combat aircraft. It seems to me that none of them compare to those big, lumbering, steel and plexiglass B-17s and their young, inexperienced crews.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|This album is a definite change in the sound that made Linkin Park one of my favorite bans. But don't take the change as a negative! Yes, as a whole, their are more soft and ballad like titles, but thats cool though. Leave Out All the Rest demonstrates how much a band can change. Rick Rubin did a good job of helping Linkin Park to develope such an awesome sound. Although tracks like Bleed it Out and No More Sorrow are what most fans were expecting, the other tracks have strong messages that are uplifting, which is what i like about bands Linkin Park. I pop this album in, turn to Shadow of the Day, and i feel like things will be cool no matter what. I like the change and i hope that Linkin Park continues to develop new sounds. If you can't except the new sound, you aren't a real fan. PERIOD!!!
0895260131|5.0|Anyone who calls this book \\"islamaphobic\\" hasn't read it.  Spencer takes his sources from the Koran and pro-Islam writers, not Western writers.  He has studies his subject well , writes in a very organized fashion and presents what Islam has to say.  If most Muslims believe as Mohammad demands, Western civilization is in for some very dark days indeed.  But, so is the entire Muslim world.
0743496728|5.0|I was so disappointed with The Tenth Circle that I almost passed on this one. In the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, it's a timely piece and one that makes a person think, as do most of Picoult's books.<br /><br />\\"In Nineteen Minutes, you can mow the front lawn, color your hair, watch a third of a hockey game. In nineteen minutes you can bake scones or get a tooth filled at the dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five. Nineteen minutes is how long it took the Tennessee Titans to sell out of tickets to the play-offs. It's the length of a sitcom, minus the commercials. It the driving distance from the Vermont border to the town of Sterling, New Hampshire. In nineteen minutes, you can order a pizza and get it delivered. You can read a story to a child or have your oil changed. You can walk a mile. You can sew a hem. In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off of it.<br /><br />In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge.\\"<br /><br />And so starts the story of Josie Cormier and Peter Houghton. Josie is the daughter of Alex Cormier, a single mother AND a superior court judge. Josie is beautiful, smart and one half of the \\"IT\\" couple at Sterling High School. Peter is a geek. He has spent his life trying to blend in to the woodwork. If you aren't noticed, then you aren't picked on. When they were younger, Josie was the only friend Peter had. She was always there trying to help him when the others were being mean. Alex and Lacy, Peter's mother, were friends until they had a falling out when the kids were in grade school. From that moment on, Josie wasn't allowed to go to Peter's house any more. But they were still friendly at school...at least until Josie got noticed by the popular kids and started hanging out with them. And this hurt Peter immensely.<br /><br />Could it be possible that this mild boy is the same one that methodically walked into Sterling High School one morning with 2 sawed-off shotguns and 2 Glock pistols? Is he the same kid that executed 10 people that day and injured 19 others? Hundreds of witnesses will say that it was. But did they really know WHO Peter Houghton was? Did anyone?<br /><br />As with all of Picoult's books, this one brings up issues that are incredibly sensitive. You want to be able to hate a person that is cold-bloodied enough to plan an attack on a high school. You want to think of him as a monster for executing his teachers and class mates. But Picoult shows a side of things that we normally don't see. She shows us the killer, and how he was victimized his entire life. She creates an empathy for this boy that was pushed so hard he snapped. And she shows us that just because kids are beautiful and popular they aren't always happy. I sometimes have a hard time reading Picoult because I know she is going to say things I don't want to hear. But her writing is so smooth and addictive, it grabs you by the throat and won't let go. As always, there is a \\"surprise\\" ending....this time I figured it out long before the climax of the book. That being said, this is one of Jodi Picoult's best books, at least of the 5 or 6 that I have read. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you have children.he the same kid that executed 10 people that day and injured 19 others? Hundreds of witnesses will say that it was.

0552998486|3.0|I'd always heard how wonderful the movie is, though I haven't seen it myself. But if the movie is wonderful, it must be one of those rare instances where a film has outdone the book that inspired it. I didn't dislike Chocolat per say, but it was very paint-by-numbers. Characters for the most part were bland and incredibly undeveloped. The best is Armande, the old woman, and Guillaume the dog lover. No one else is likable or hatable, not even the narrator (whom is certainly not a witch at all, I have no idea what people who think so have been reading) and her daughter. The plot seems to be very superficial and it makes the book seem like an abridged version. Things happen but they happen fast and quick and usually with very little sense if doing anything more than skimming. <br /> <br />As said, I did like this book, it was fun, quirky, maybe even a bit 'magical'. But it was also very flawed and shouldn't carry expectations of anything more than a quick, light read.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Don't read too much into reviews that seek to pigeonhole the \\"sound\\" of this album-- invariably placing it in 1970's Southern California.  That's not what this recording is about.  Rather, it's yet another magnificent collection of songs from the strongest ensemble in rock music today.  The first listen is enjoyable, but it just keeps getting better and better and better still with repeated spins.  No, it isn't perfect, but I strongly feel it's the best release of 2007 thus far.  (4.5 stars)
B00003CXB4|5.0|propably one of the best animated motion pictures ever. I hated the addition of the new song, but I believe that was directed towards the younger audiences. Many extras, most i liked to watch
B000N3AXQU|4.0|This is a preview of the Blu-ray version. I can tell you that the picture brightness is amazing on this DVD even on 101\\" projected image. Colors are nice with a little blue tint. The only issue I have is the high level of graininess of this DVD especially with night and indoor scenes (big part of the movie). There are many extras and many are shot in HD. In fact some of the extras displays a more perfect Blu-ray picture than the film itself. The Movie is great and very realistic. Sylvester Stallone at his very best, but he appear much older in this movie. Again Great Movie, Great extras, Good Transfer, but for $27 the high level of picture grains really bothers me.
B0000025ZF|5.0|I am a fan of Roger Waters, I just love this album.  If you like \\"The Wall\\" and \\"The final cut\\", you will love for sure this cd. This is a conceptual album, so the same melody is repeated frequently.  You will recognize some riffs of \\"The Wall\\" and this is no surprise, there is a rumour going on that both concept has been composed at the same time.  <br />Both projects have been proposed to the rest of the band (Pink Floyd) and the other guys chosed to go on with \\"The Wall\\". After Roger left the band, he decided to record the other project he had in mind few years before. Erci Clapton is doin a great job at the guitar (this ain't a surprise !)  I have the chance to meet Roger during the \\"Radio K.A.O.S. tour and he put is autograph on my \\"Pros and Cons\\" cd so this is a real keeper for me I can tell !
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|I've had this CD for over a month and I still listen to it everyday!!
0140620338|4.0|Dorian Gray is very good novel, but it suffers from soapbox syndrome. The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading.
B000000XB9|5.0|I've tried to find other bands from the 60s-70s which have the same grittiness and raw beats as Creedence. Some came close, but nothing seemed to deliver the same level of punch CCR does.  It's thumping, growling, stripped-down rock n' roll that isn't swallowed up in a wall of distortion or overproduction that a lot of bands today are preoccupied with. If you're itching for something raw and without gloss that isn't acoustic or listless indie (snoooze!),  CCR serves it up straight and hard. I'd even say they're the AC/DC of swamp/roots rock.  <br /> <br />These tracks are from both volumes, but they're my favorite picks for songs with beats that don't mess around and a rockin' melody: <br /> <br />Born on The Bayou, Tombstone Shadow, I Heard it Through the Grapevine, Run Through the Jungle, I Put A Spell on You, Good Golly Miss Molly
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I rate Richard Attenborough's narration in this BBC version to be more engaging than the Discovery Channel version.  The video quality is excellent and the dramatic scenes projected on my 10 ft. screen are WOW!  Gotta be the best nature series to-date.
6304711905|4.0|I've read some on the life and times of the Earp clan.  I'm not a historian mind you, but I know enough to understand that the Earps spent a good deal of time on both sides of the law, and that they went wherever opportunity and adventure took them. They were also tight as a family could be, and looked out for one another.  Despite some historical inaccuracies, this movie portrays the Earps well, in a fair-handed manner.    If only Kurt Russell could recapture some of the magic of this performance, he could have a respectable career again.  He needs to look for more roles like this.  The scene of his warning to the cow-boy gang before the vendetta ride was awesome.    Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday was fantastic.  I have never seen anybody look so sickly throughout a movie before.  He was pale and sweating like a pig throughout, yet nobody messed with him because death sat at his side. And he could unleash it.    This is a fine western with an all-star cast.  Don't miss it.
B0002ZXCY4|5.0|I don't know the project Ayreon very well, but what I can tell, as a prog music lover, this double cd is very well done and produced.  The composition are complex and the sound is very loud and good, the music is amazing, my only complaint is for the narrative sequences, these sequences should have been written on the cd booklet only, to let all the place for the music and vocals.  Overall, an interesting double cd.  Update, now in 2015, this album has go through several listenings since my original review, now I can say that it is a masterpiece, hence I  have upgrade my review to a five stars !!!  This is one of a kind double album, astonishing production. Congratulations !
B000OONTFU|4.0|Inside the case are five double sided discs; one disc for each of the films and the other two serving as a kind of data bank, with hours and hours of Matrix related info and behind the scenes footage and discussions.<br /><br />Off the bat, the three movies look and sound absolutely fantastic in HD. The Matrix Trilogy is finally able to be seen as was intended. Special features on the film side of the discs are plentiful and easy to access. My personal favorite extra was the \\"In-Movie Experience\\", a nice little picture in picture supplement that plays over the length of the entire film and gives you just about everything you need to know in a nutshell concerning the making of the films.<br /><br />The extras for the set are the exact same selection as the Ultimate Matrix Collection that was released on DVD a while back. All of these extras, including the Animatrix, are in standard 480p definition. If there is anything that keeps this set from being an instant purchase, it's this little detail. I really would've liked to have gotten the Animatrix shorts in HD as well but sometimes you have to take what they give you. Now, that's not to say that the Animatrix looks bad, it's just basically the exact same copy that was released before, even with the same menu screens.<br /><br />If you are interested in the filmmaking process and want to know every little detail about what went into creating the Matrix films, then you might as well pick this set up because it has something like thirty-five hours of content that will keep even the most die hard Matrix enthusiast busy for days. It's the kind of package that most will not get to finish in it's entirety due to the sheer amount of content.<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed that the set isn't completely in HD (again, the choice to present the Animatrix in standard def is just mind boggling) but that's about the only complaint I have. I'm just glad that the Matrix Trilogy has made it to HD-DVD in pristine quality.
1416914285|1.0|This whole book just felt tired and done before, like I've read or seen the same concepts in other fictional universes many times (such as Buffy and Star Wars).  <br /> <br />I picked this up because I liked the title and the description and am willing to give anything a chance and it just didn't do anything for me.  Besides the above mentioned, it was a bit dense as well, to the point I don't know that it would hold a YA audience.  The writing was a bit flowery, leading the mind to wander.  Several details simply didn't add up about the characters and their personalities.  The characters were strained and flat.  I forced myself to finish it because I'd paid full cover price and felt cheated out of my money.  If you're interested, I suggest picking City of Bones up at your local library and seeing how it fits.
0060888695|5.0|Sissy Spacek does a wonderful job reading Harper Lee's classic.  She has a light Southern accent that makes you believe you are listening to Scout.  If the performance weren't enough, the price and the packaging make it all worth the while.  The tracks are evenly spaced, and they are well catalogued on the CD jackets.  Definitely a pleasure all around!
B000EZMIC4|4.0|Good, very good.  Essential for any Floyd fan.  But dang it, why didn't they go get Roger?  I mean, if they could kiss and make up for Live8, why not this? <br /> <br />It loses a star because it's only in stereo, not 5.1
B0000027I6|5.0|This is Roger Waters at its best, it is one of the best album of the decade in my mind (the 90's) This cd is what we often call \\"a desert island cd\\" if you see what I mean.
B000005GYI|5.0|This is one of the best albuns by Milton Nascimento. Great repertoire, excellent vocals. Don't miss it.
1905236042|4.0|I like using Yoga Pretzels in my classes, they help me keep a kid-like mood. The kids love being able to pick a pose or two from the cards. They take time to study the drawings and find ways to share and cooperate. I love the \\"Time In\\" section-- the relaxation scripts work equally well for adults and children. Animal Friend is my favorite. <br />My only criticism would be that the instructions for the poses don't say how to get out of the poses, or how to move into another pose. With a little experience and imagination this is easy to overcome, so it's not much of a drawback. <br />The color combinations are striking, drawings whimsical and clear, poses have a good range from easy for anyone to really challenging. Reasonable price too.
B00006FDCD|5.0|One of the best movies based on Stephen Kings books! When I first saw it it scared the hell out of me!!
B00028492K|5.0|Braveheart is obviously a great movie, evidenced by the reviews you can read here. <br /> <br />As I watched it with my son last week, I was struck by the role that faith plays in the story.  In the opening scenes, Longshanks is described as a pagan king.  Several characters pray and engage in other solemn religious rituals.  Steven the Irish even has conversations with the Almighty, and believes he was sent by Him to protect Wallace.  And Wallace believes that too.  Before  Wallace's torture, he prays that God will allow him to die well.  His prayer is answered. <br /> <br />I reflected that this has been a theme in several projects that Gibson has been associated with.  Patriot, We Were Soldiers, Signs, The Passion of the Christ. <br /> <br />I like most of the movies I've seen Mel in.  This one is no exception.
B000E41MRC|5.0|I fully understand both the reviews of disappointment and approval of this DVD, \\"The Triumph of the Will.\\" As a WWII fanatic, and one who owns virtually every important, and less important, documentary, I give this film a five-star review for many reasons. Before I share those reasons, once again, I sympathize with those with less favorable responses. The one criticism that I relate to is the marching sequences. The film begins with what appears to be endless marching in 1934 Nuremberg.     What is particularly monotonous is the lack of variety; with so many thousands of soldiers marching with spades (post WWI armistice limited Germany to a 100-thousand army, so they didn't want to appear aggressive at that stage), I was expecting to see tiger tanks with their 88 mm. guns, field artillery, transports, and quite literally \\"the whole nine yards\\", but this is not the case. You will see the SA, the SS, soldiers and nazis of every shape and uniform, but no hardware other than shovels and swords, banners, swastikas, and decorum. So the disappointment for me, and from what I gain from other reviews, is that Leni Rienfestahl (hereafter LR) gives us plenty of marching soldiers ad tedium. The viewer is treated to about 25 minutes of introductory marching before the first speech.    However, the strengths of the film far outweigh the flaws. Keep in mind, 1930's movie making was far different than it is today. Back then, if a director wanted to \\"truck\\" in or out with the camera, he/she had to literally use a truck to do that, giving a zooming effect (that's where the word \\"truck\\" came from as per movie directing). In addition, LR had to use existing light sources, large or small, and no added SFX, B-roll editing, and lap dissolves were done by hand. The film reminded me so much of Disney's \\"Fantasia\\" with the use of lighting effects, and vignettes consisting of brief fade-in and fade-outs to build viewer expectation and tension.      Now, my list of favorable feature findings:1. The extended raw footage and splendid directing allows the viewer to appreciate the ambience of the moment. You feel that you are actually there experiencing the moment. My mother attended a number of Hitler Youth rallies, and told me that a combination of music, color, chanting, etc., left the participant feeling almost paralyzed. The SA had their members littered everywhere throughout the audience who would continually incite the audience to react with heated emotion and praise.    2. The speeches by Hitler and others are unedited. When you view other documentaries, such as \\"The World at War,\\" you will be treated to only a few moments of speech sound bites. In this DVD, you will see Hitler uncut and hear his words, which are as strange as watching the man himself. He reminds me of a sales speaker I once heard, blasting the audience with the qualities of his product, but not explaining why the audience should buy it. The tripe and shallowness of Hitler's words can only really be appreciated as one can both observe, and listen to his presentation uninterrupted. Here again, the vast majority of documentaries out there give only snippets of Hitler's speeches. Suggestion: if you get tired of the marching and want to view the speeches, simply jot down the times from your DVD player.    3. As a propaganda film produced to be exported, we understand what the nazis held to be near and dear: Hitler was in full gear with his war machine and wanted to show German might through intimidation. The well-orchestrated rally demonstrated unity, determination, organization, and most importantly a national \\"vision\\" of a German ideal codified in one individual, Adolph Hitler. As Hess declared to the people, \\"Hitler is Germany; Germany is Hitler.\\" The sheer numbers of the multitudes is awesome; I can only try to imagine what it must have been like to have been a Frenchman, or Hungarian, or a Russian, viewing this film for the first time.      4. As an extended film, the viewer cansee how the people dressed and carried out their daily lives at the time. How sad that Nuremberg was such a magnificent city prior to the Allied bombing, and the introductory aerial scenes of the city are breathtaking.     5. This is a digitally remastered DVD from 35mm film. The resolution is excellent to the degree that you can see the follicles in a close-up of Hitler's face. Unlike many similar documentaries of questionable quality, this DVD allow the viewer to appreciate facial expressions, uniform insignia, and other detail.    If you view this film in the historical context in which it was produced, LR was indeed brilliant and \\"done Hitler proud.\\" If you want Hitler in the context of modern filmmaking, you will probably feel disappointed. An excellent alternative would be the recent feature film about the last ten days of Hitler's life titled, \\"Downfall\\", produced in German with English sub-titles. Even still, try to view \\"Triumph of the Will\\" in the context of what the Nazis wanted the world to see: behind the pagentry -- power!    Then, be prepared to enter real history: a Nazi night rally, Hitler youth (notice the commitment and determination on their faces!), the farmer's march, the magnificent Congress Hall of the NSDAP, Reich labor review, Reichswehr review, SA and SS review, the Liebstandarte bodyguards, Lutze, Hess, Goebbels, Hitler, and yes, lots of marching. So, fasten your boots, enjoy, and if the marching is a bit much, keep your remote handy.
B000O75F7C|3.0|I have been a fan of this band since the time when twenty people would show up in clubs to see them.  They have come a long way and deservedly so. As a studio band, they may be in my top 10.  This release is good, but after 5 listenings, its not grabbing me as the masterpiece others are implying.  Everyone's tastes are different, even in the context of the same music or band.  So, I am not going to trash those that love or don't love this album.  I \\"grew\\" with this band and supported them.  I think more great works from them are on still on the horizon, which is saying a lot.  This release is still a worthy piece of P-tree.  I personally would like to see them get back to more ambiance and atmospheric music mixed with the brilliance of their heavier recent releases. I can understand why that may not happen - they are selling albums and getting wider appeal now.  As live band, they are fine.  Not great.  Its a little too formulaic, but that is common of many bands when it comes to playing live.  They go out and play their music, do a great job, but don't really jam per se.  The difference between good studio acts and live acts are universes apart.  The really good live acts just leave you glowing when its over.  P-tree is not built for that - so my expectations are not that high when I see them.  But its certainly good enough.  I will be catching them again tommorrow in Baltimore. Great band, really glad they came along, and that I found them so many years ago.  Average album tho, in my opinion.
B00009W8N2|3.0|If you are an Opeth fan, as I am, you know what to expect from them. Honest, intense, moving, heavy stuff. You will get all of these things from their first release, \\"Orchid.\\" What you will also get, unfortunately, is a dated sound and an immature approach. Is this a terrible thing? Of course not--this is Mikael Akerfeld's very first studio album, and it shows all the promise that Opeth have come to impress us with.  <br />The vocals have an overwrought reverb on them, the overall theme of the album has an amateurish feel to it--these are things one would expect from a no-name artist of the early 90s. What we don't typically expect, though, is a harbinger of something brilliant, which you will find on this release. Opeth is one of the best, most authentic, heaviest bands you can possibly hope for in this age of immediate gratification, pop sensibility, and, generally speaking, crap. Orchid is a record that, 13 years later, is more well-thought out and crafted than 90% of what you can buy these days. Mikael is a true genius--someone who will never let you down with his ambition and hope--and this album is well worth the purchase price to anyone wishing to hear and understand the full legacy of a band as true to music and beauty as Opeth.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Bought this DVD for my husband and he loved it! The complete series, how much better can you get?
B00005JPFH|4.0|It would be so, so easy for director Sam Raimi to play it safe, remain formulaic and swing off into the sunset.  Fortunately, he and the screenwriters did not do that with SM3. <br /> <br />I have read the other reviewers here chastising the number of villains in this movie, and the alleged \\"watering-down\\" affect.  Too much Tobey, too much action, too much romance, too much CGI.  To that I say...nonsense!  Ignore these reviews, some people will never be satisfied. <br /> <br />SM3 is a fascinating look at a very basic human flaw...the desire for mercy and forgiveness vs. the unwillingness to grant it because of a lust for revenge.  Mix in Parker's impulsive naivete concerning matters of romance, and the tension that it creates with MJ, and you have the ingredients for an entertaining love story. Maguire, with his squeaky voice, is the perfect Spidey, and gangly Dunst, with her stringy hair and girl-next-door appeal plays a wonderful MJ. <br /> <br />The story moves very quickly, briefly touching on many legends in the original Marvel Comics tales, as it must.  In a perfect world, we would have a dedicated movie to deal individually with Sandman, the alien symbiote, Venom, the new Goblin and Gwen Stacy.  That would be the only satisfactory result for many of the critics of this movie that you'll read here. <br /> <br />But if you love Maguire and Dunst in their roles as I do, then you know that that just isn't practical.  If this is to be their last SM film, as has been strongly suggested, then bravo for this final installment from them.  Let other actors and directors and writers try to pick up the ball and run, and suffer the inevitable comparison and scorn from the critics (Batman, Superman, James Bond).  These two will always be Spidey and MJ, and they have set the bar high.   <br /> <br />As for SM3, we find satisfaction in friends reconciled, forgiveness given, personal demons conquered, the sorrow of loss and graceful love rekindled.  These actors are sure andcomfortable in their roles, and the storyline does not fail them.  Add to that the wide open set-up for future installments, and SM lovers everywhere are left with hope.  Fear not, the plot is well done, easy to follow and compelling.  Only the cynics will repress the emotions aroused.
0743201140|5.0|We have a friend who is madly in love with this book and it's accompanying strengths test.  She convinced many of us to buy the book, read it (a must - before taking the test), and take the test.  Our family members have gained so much insight into each other's strengths, and it has been all good! We were particularly interested in helping our High School-aged son understand his strengths before launching into college and the wide world.  Now we understand how he processes information, how he connects with people, and why he handles situations the way he does.  He now knows what might be easy for him to adapt to in college, and which adjustments might have to be more deliberate.  It is amazing how much better we all communicate with each other.  I also understand how my husband's different strengths (we are SO opposite) are actually valuable assets to our life together, rather than \\"annoying traits\\" as I had self-centeredly regarded them.  This is a very, very helpful book!
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Es un incre&iacute;ble que una banda que vendi&oacute; millones de copias de sus dos primeros albumes, saque al mercado un cd tan malo. Si eres un fan&aacute;tico de Linkin Park, no lo compres porque ten la seguridad que te defraudar&aacute;s!!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is not a feel good flick.  Do not rent or buy this if you are looking for a good time, a laugh, or any type of happy ending.  It is a serious, intense piece of art which examines drug addiction at close range, showing the devastation it causes in several people's lives.  The acting is incredible (I'm not sure if Jennifer Connely has matched this yet) and Aronofsky's direction is idiosyncratic (his use of repetition can be annoying, no doubt, but incredibly effective).  I have worked with addicts for many years and there are two things this movie does better than any other movie on this subject: <br /> <br />a.  it shows that drug addiction is not limited to any one age range; there is no \\"typical\\" addict, it crosses boundaries of age/race/gender <br /> <br />b.  this movie shows how addiction can completely change the type of person you are and induce you into doing things you would never otherwise do   <br /> <br />oh yeah---it is also beneficial that people understand that certain diet pills (although ephedra is now off the market) and caffiene pills (no-doz) etc. are addictive and can certainly be dangerous if abused.  This movie seems to have helped people be aware of this fact.   <br /> <br />To me, this movie stands as one of the very best ever made about drug addiction.   <br /> <br />
B00003CXTG|1.0|It has Ben Aflac (quack) and Alec Baldwin in it.  Minus two stars for each of those.
0060594896|5.0|Jack Canfield is wonderful.  This book is written for anyone who wants more success in their life.  I have no doubt that by applying Jack's Priciples, my life is never going to be the same.  Keep up the good works, Jack.
B00005JPMX|5.0|Personally, I think the battle between Raph and Leo was a long time coming. The movie was awesome, and it answered a lot of the questions from the old movies. I now the CGI upset a lot of people, but it enabled the Turtles to do more things than they ever could in a live action film. Overall, a must see for all TMNT fans! <br /> <br />
1400063515|4.0|I loved this book for the impact it has on my thinking. As with Taleb's previous book \\"Fooled by Randomness\\", I learned to look at the \\"bigger\\" picture not logically, not rationally, but honestly
B000BPPPEU|5.0|I don't know which one was funnier the first or the second, but they are both great.
0374105235|4.0|I had a very hard time with this book.  Here was a child who lost everything, and became a soldier when he should have been in middle school. He witnessed horrors that no one should ever see.  And he helped cause them as well.  Do I understand why he became a soldier?  Yes. Do I think he should have been tried for crimes against humanity?  Yes.  Here was a little boy, who helped wipe out villages, to get supplies and food for his troops.  Did he ever try to save an innocent civilian?  No.  Can I understand his rage?  Yes.  But does that excuse not even trying to subterfuge orders in ways that couldn't have been detected?  Could he have shot but not shot to kill civilians?<br /><br />How can one be rehabilitated?  I don't know how someone can live with oneself after committing atrocities such as described in this book.<br /><br />I feel horrible about what happened to the author.  But I feel just as horrible about what he did to other people's families.
B000M06K5C|4.0|I like both Silent Alarm and A Weekend in the City, though, while Silent Alarm seems to have higher highs and lower lows, A Weekend in the City is more level throughout, with a more cohesive and adjoined nature.  While I don't think any one track has the instant-classic element that Banquet did, all the tracks on A Weekend in the City are solid and sound like they all could have been written solely in one weekend in the city.  It feels like a genuine album, and while Silent Alarm was one as well, on that album it feels like the songs could have been written over a much lengthier period of time.  I think the title on this newest release is fitting and symbolic of its feel.  I'm real curious to see where Bloc Party goes next and applaud this sophomore effort, for it maintains their trademark sound that sets the band apart and leaves the road wide open for growth possibilities.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|It is only after viewing a series such as this that people in countries other than the United States, such as is my family, can appreciate the enormity of the job that the President and his staff must have.  The terrific acting, the amazing writeing and the thought provoking issues make this a firm favorite in my house.
B00005JPGO|1.0|Since so many have reviewed and seen this movie already, let me give you the end upfront: this is a message about the conflict diamond trade; it's a dramatically presented documentary that wants to get the viewer's attention to the cruelty of human nature when pursuing potential profits hidden somewhere in a muddy riverbank. <br /> <br />Sure, it's a decently executed message, but that doesn't make it a ... movie. That's right, I don't consider this a movie by any means of the imagination. Lack of solid establishing shots; lousy scenery; editing glitches and awkward transitions; mechanical, scripted acting, just to name but a few of my gripes. Just because the Academy gave it 5 nominations doesn't mean, well you get the point. <br /> <br />One reviewer wrote \\"...it's the brutal and compelling action sequences that will stick with you. There is much violence to be had in \\"Blood Diamond,\\" much death and bloodshed.\\" Does (s)he mean, in between the walking around the bush of the two main characters, while they are trying to pretend to (i) care about a lost son and (ii) some big piece of carbon that the other hid somewhere. Granted, we all have our own unique perspective on something. But when the end of the movie reveals that the makers of this footage cared only about one thing, its humanitarian message, and not about presenting it as a real, emotionally involved story with charismatic acting and great cinematography, \\"compelling\\" action sequences that have me, the viewer on the edge of my seat rather than bored to death hoping the story will somehow turn around, I can't help but feel, well, cheated.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|wilco has a tendency to create wonderful albums that really grow on you. first couple listens i was rather underwhelmed by sky blue sky... but as with all the wilco albums i own (and for that matter most great albums i own) it takes a while to get into it and really appreciate it. sky blue sky is a mature album by a mature band... normally rather mellow and comtemplative, but many moments that remind you how good a band wilco really is. highly recommended.
B000IHYY52|4.0|The picture quality on this Blueray disc is oustanding.  The soundtrack is encoded as DTS HD master audio.  It still sounds very good even if my equipment can only extract the DTS 1.5 mps core.  My Sony BPS1 does not have the capability to decode DTS HD master Audio.  All blue ray concerts should have uncompressed PCM. Uncompressed PCM never needs decoding and is compatible with most receiver's.
B00005ABX0|4.0|I feel that this grouping of albums is a blessing in that you can get two important but slightly flawed albums of Tehe Beach Boys for a low price. The music is unbelievable especially Smiley Smile. It is exhilirating to hear Brian Wilson's genius in this stripped-down form. What is there just teases you as to what it would have been if all the problems of Smile hadn't occured. The second half, Wild Honey, is just fun Beach Boys, no psychedelia at all, just fun. It's a great summer album all together, the first half for when your blazing, the second for when your driving around in the hot summer air. I recommend this album.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|I have been a wilco fan for over ten years.  This album seems to get back to the basics.  I thought the last two albums were way to experimental.  This album gets back to the alt-country sound that older wilco fans will love.  I can understand why some of the newer fans won't like it.  It seems to take a step backward after the last two.  I highly recommend this for fans of the first three albums.
B000O178BY|5.0|This NIN release reminds me very much of The Downward Spiral as well as previously releases.  The songs are more electronic and intense than songs on The Fragile.  This is the way I want to hear Trent's music, raw and achingly original!  If you like earlier NIN music you will enjoy this release!
B000LAZDQA|4.0|It is good to have the DVD of this film which I enjoyed very much when I saw it in London. The \\"extras\\" are good, too. My only criticism is that I was not warned it was unplayable on UK DVDs (that probably ties in with the fact that a UK version seems not yet to be available). Fortunately it is playable on my PC!

0142001104|5.0|I saw Ben Zander speak - inspiring to say the least. Then I bought 20 copies to share with my friends and co-workers. I think the advice in this book is pertinent to everybody regarless their vocation. The sage advice Rosa and Ben give to the reader gives one the opportunity to change their outlook on life and interactions with others without having to discover it on their own over many years. I think this should be required reading for all students and professionals. The world would be a much nicer place.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I only new vaguely of Nightwish until one of my friends turned me on to it, and after listening to this album, I think I have a new favorite band. <br /> <br />A few of the songs are a bit harsh (I don't like screaming, so sue me), but others are downright haunting. My favorite track is \\"Ghost Love Score\\" which makes full use of the band's orchestral resources and is one of the most beautiful and epic pieces of music I have ever heard. <br /> <br />\\"Once\\" manages to provide a broad spectrum of sound, and all of it is of superb quality.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Having listened to a great deal of Coldplay's rarities and B-sides before, I have to say that I was unfortunately a little let-down by X&Y. Though it's by no means a bad album, when compared to tracks like \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\", \\"Spies\\", or their almost completely unknown \\"Ladder to the Sun\\", nothing here quite matches the complexity that we all know this group is capable of. There's a lot of great moments, but not quite as much to make you drop what you're doing and hang onto every word.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for their best work, I'd have to recommend \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" over X&Y. If you already own \\"Rush\\" and like what you've heard, by all means give it a shot. But just make sure you listen with an open mind.
0618680004|5.0|The title of this book is quite agressive. I thought it is going to be from some left-winger crying about inquisition and crusades. The title of this book should be \\"The God Hypothesis\\" because that is how Dawkings handles the subject, calmly and scientifically. <br /> <br />One thing I disagree with Dawkins is that I think he overuses the \\"If god created something really complex then what created god which must be even more complex\\" argument. I do not think that God even exists but I also think this logic is fundamentally wrong. Imagine a stone age tribe finding a piece of newspaper in the ocean shore and wondering what it is: something from birds, bees, seaweed, tree bark or unknown alien technology from outside the island? The last alternative is totally perfect (and as we know, correct) answer to solve the puzzle. In Hawkins logic, the author of 'alien technology' hypothesis should also somehow to explain what is European civilization and how its printing press works. No way! That is not what the question was about! Well, European printers have amazing technology but they are not omniscient, omnipotent, do not command rain clouds and do not answer prayers, so theists connecting 'alien technology' to Bible God are equally wrong. (By 'alien technology' I mean anything not constrained by Universe laws as we know them, not little green men flying around with saucers).  <br /> <br />Sorry, maybe that is not what I should write in a book review but I think it is the biggest logical error in otherwise perfect book. <br />
B00005JLCI|5.0|Though quite lengthy, this version of Hamlet is amazing. Kenneth Branah does a wonderful job acting as Hamlet and Kate Winslet's performance of Olivia is equally appealing. This age old story of trechery, pride, and revenge comes to life in this movie and I would reccomend it to anyone.
0688145078|5.0|My son loves this book, and it's illustrations.  Both of us love Falwell's We have a baby, but this is a good companion to that for any expectant or newly additioned family. I like that this is \\"big brother\\" specific, as that is a special title to the only boy in our family who is quite used to being the baby, lol.  A good buy.
1400079179|5.0|I read this book and I also read Holy Blood, Holy Grail. Even though, I think they compliment each other perfectly, I prefer this fictional version to the supposid' non-fiction version of Holy Blood... If you are looking for facts to back up Dan Brown's thriller, then Holy Blood is perfect for you. If you are simply looking for an enjoyable read that is thought provoking then Da Vinci Code should be your choice. If you've already seen the movie, then I would not recommend this book as it is a slightly difficult read, but I believe this is because of the style of the author, and the fact that it is different than what I am used to. It is also a perfect copy of the movie, and I believe you might find yourself board. However, if you have not seen the movie, then I highly recommend this book! Dan Brown has a way of twisting the existing theories of the The Merovingian Kings into an exciting plot line that will keep you guessing until the end.<br /><br />Some people denouce this book right away and argue that this theory isn't possible because that would mean Jesus didn't died on the cross, but I say Mary M could have married Jesus and been pregnant before he died on the cross and still his line would have carried on. If you think of it that way, the story not only becomes possible but plausible, afterall the bible is missing about 18 years of Jesus's life... only God knows what truly happened during those \\"missing years.\\" The church has been wrong before, afterall look at Aristotle - the church placed him under house arrested for saying that the earth was round!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've tried other big name headphones and ear buds, and for opera listening, these Sony MDR7506 are excellent.  They are almost as good as the Sony MDR V700, which sound even more present.  The problem with both of them is this: they sound wonderful for opera, but they break quite easily and are short-lived.<br />Why bother?  The sound is worth it, if you've realized and accepted that  you're going to have to have to replace them every year or two.  I had read that they were made for voice and that specialized function comes through with flying colors, clarity and full bodied, rich beauty of sound.<br />They aren't even comfortable.  But they do deliver excellent sound for the opera lover, so, only if you don't mind shoddy workmanship undermining superb excellent sound......  I realize many wouldn't purchase a product with such transparent planned obsolescence, but for my ears, the sound was truly exceptional, and worth it, at least until I find something better.  I continue to look.<br />-------------------------<br />Post script: I just took my 4th pair in for replacement 5 months after I purchased them.  I was told by the large, national (and sympathetic) seller that these headphones are the industry standard, but so notoriously breakable, that schools and studios usually order many of them, knowing that they just won't last long...  Sorry if the other fans of these headphones are outraged, but it's apparently a known/accepted fact that these Sony headphones are great sounding but cheaply made.  I have to add that I lead a very sedate life and don't even take them anywhere with me, using them exclusively at home with iPod or computer.  I've also decided that I prefer them to MDR V700s.<br />[[ASIN:B00001W0DH Sony MDR-V700DJ DJ Style Monitor Series Headphones]]<br /><br />Update Feb. 2012  As I knew would happen, these headphones broke once again, in exactly the same way.  They seem to develop a short at the plug, causing one of the channels to kill. This inevitable breakdown occurs after 1 or 2 years of in-home use.  I suspect that the chord - which is immensely long and heavy - is inappropriate for an iPod.  The weight of the chord seems to stress and break something in the plug.<br />I can no longer justify buying these headphones, no matter how much I like the sound.  It's too costly to keep replacing them and they're bad for the environment. I think I've had about a half dozen pairs over the years, all of which met the same fate.  I've read that Sennheisers have a replaceable chord.  I'm going to look into them.<br /><br />Another Update Autumn 2013  Couldn't resist. I bought another pair. I had the plug replaced on my previous pair but it only worked for a couple of weeks before the exact same problem returned - one channel shorted out.  My new pair is very nice, but I anticipate its death in the next year or two.
B000NVIGC0|2.0|I'm not sure what happened to Wilco on this album.  Nearly all of the songs sound the same.  The ones that don't sound the same don't really impress either.  'Impossible Germany' probably qualifies as the best song on the disc, but the solo on the end doesn't mesh well with the rest of the track.  Usually I'm very fond of Cline's guitar work (see Ashes of American Flags on the Kicking Television live record) but here it's annoying, rapidly morphing into a collection of high-pitched electronic squawks and warbles that do nothing to help along the first bit of the track.  I heard the band play 'Impossible Germany' live last October.  Then, it sounded like Zeppelin, and it was good.  Here, it sounds like a headache, and it is bad. <br /> <br />The lack of a strong, heavier rock backing to pretty much all of the songs means that the album rides on its lyrics.  Unfortunately, Tweedy's songwriting falls flat.  Summerteeth this ain't.  There were some weak moments on Ghost, but those were easily excusable.  Now take all of those minor weak moments and stretch them across an entire disc.  'Side with the Seeds' is bad (what the hell is Tweedy singing about here?).  'Shake it Off' is even worse, with bad lyrics and terrible music.  The 'dah-dee-dum' chord progression throughout forces me to hit the skip button without fail. <br /> <br />The album's ultimate failing is that with pretty much the same musical backing throughout, no track can easily stand apart from another.  Good rock albums are about contrast, with harder and softer numbers sprinkled throughout in an alternating fashion, each one setting the other apart; they all stand out.  Here that can't happen, and the result is a collection of music that induces nothing but boredom. <br /> <br />I really want to like this disc.  It's by Wilco, after all, and Wilco has been one of my most favorite bands for a long time now.  But I can't, for the aforementioned reasons.  This album has been compared to work by the Eagles.  There's two problems with that comparison: the first is that the Eagles already came and went.  The adult-contemporary yacht-rock genre is so heavily mined that Wilco isn't setting itself apart here.  The second problem is that the Wilco of Sky Blue Sky is simply not as good as the Eagles were.
B000002H33|5.0|This was my 1st introduction to Metallica & my first ever cd I had purchased... that was about 18 years ago. I'm still listening to what I consider to be Metallicas finest album & fan favourite. if your new to Metallica purchase this before buying their newer stuff, if your an old fan like myself do your self and your ears a favour and purchase MOP on reissue Vinyl pressed on HQ 180g, It will blow your speakers apart!
B000O178BY|4.0|Trent has changed his style just enough for Year Zero to be slightly techno - but still quite impressive! I always love at least three tracks on each CD (sometimes more), though Year Zero has six that I play continuously. Also great for cardio workouts :)
0465043577|3.0|The book has an interesting idea, explaining about fractal geometry and randomness, including in financial markets. It's probably handy if you're trader, or if you want to explain market behaviour.

It's the only book that took me to finish in 2 weeks. ever!!!
B000F7CMRW|3.0|Syrian tells the story of a high-level, U.S. conspiracy to install an easily manipulated, half-wit playboy as the ruler of an oil-rich fictitious nation, Syriana, rather than his brother, a PhD economist with independent-minded aspirations to actually help his country. <br /> <br />I found the plot disjointed at times - particularly in certain subplots. For instance, it wasn't clear to me why the oil analyst had reason to blame the Syriana royal for the drowning of the analyst's son at the royal's party. The political alignment and motivations of the terrorists who torture the movie's main character were just as murky. <br /> <br />Part of the problem was the script, which went overboard in trying to show rather than tell what was going on. A little explanation at times is appropriate and necessary if you don't want the story to lose the audience's understanding and attention. <br /> <br />For a compelling, geopolitical thriller set entirely in a real oil-rich state, check out SAUDI MATCH POINT. It tells the story of U.S. and Chinese competition for Saudi oil and influence while weaving in a local drama set in one of the world's most repressive and bizarre societies. The novel is available online from the publisher, Blacksmith Books. <br />
B0001932ZA|4.0|Excellent film & 6.1 ex surround sound, but passable picture quality. yeah I know it's an old film & very dated, but to state \\"remastered in HD\\" and have black spots all over the film is a let down, the soundtrack kicks and the packaging is nice plus all the classic Arnie 1 liners are here and worth the purchse price alone...<br /><br />Fingers crossed if it's released on Blu-ray it will be remastered correctly...
B000O75F7C|5.0|I first listened to Deadwing, their prior CD, and was thrilled to discover this amazing group.  It is clear with Fear of A Blank Planet that they are evolving in a beautiful way, with seamless time signature changes, ethereal chords and melodies, consistently flawless dynamic changes within songs, a huge library of synth sounds and driving grooves.  The creativity is remarkable with perfect execution.  Pink Floyd is a huge influence, which I couldn't be happier about, but they have come into their own over the years developing an original sound.  Every track is great, but for me, the standouts are Fear of a Blank Planet, Anesthetize (unbelievable!), and My Ashes.  I can't imagine a hard rock music lover with an appreciation for classical and contemporary music not being thrilled with this CD.
B000002UB3|5.0|If you judge albums by production value, compositional structure, song to song transition, lyrical content, etc.. abbey road would perhaps rate as the beatles best album.. The album plays almost like a classical piece of music everything has its place... It may not be as influential or as staggering as sergent pepper or revolver.. but it represents the absolute zenith of musical technique in rock and roll.. Generally considered as Paul's project - repeated listenings show that it is, in fact the strongest group effort of the band.. George Harrisson wrote perhaps the two best songs on the album.. and ringo's tune is unforgettable.. John is a little more distant yet his contrubutions are always poignantly felt.. especially on the opening track (obviously) and on the 'sun king'... Paul's ambitious compositions end the album in an almost symphonic style.. This was perhaps the most fitting final touch of a band that brought the world 10 years of some of the greatest music of the century..

0143039431|2.0|\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is one of those intimidating \\"great books\\" that everyone knows about and no one reads.  The irony is that it is a book about ordinary people, and the language and plot are hardly difficult at all.  The Joads, driven off their Oklahoma farm by the encroachment of industrialization, seek a better life in California - with thousands of others in the same position.  The migrants are forced to compete for survival, but only by leveraging their power as a group can they ever truly triumph.  The theme of individual vs. group is further emphasized by the form of the novel.  Steinbeck uses alternating chapters about the Joads and \\"interchapters\\" about the migrants as a whole.  Thus the book, besides being the great American epic about the Joads, is also a social and political novel that caused an enormous uproar upon its publication.  This is a book that is part of the collective American conscious and should be read by everyone who wants to feel thoroughly educated.
0765315246|5.0|I just jumped right into this book without reading anything about it first, and I couldn't put it down. Excellent storytelling from John Scalzi. Many authors would have unnecessarily taken more than 400 pages to write a book like this. Not Scalzi -- the restraint in editing this book really pays off. <br /> <br />It's also funny sometimes in both situation and dialog. Among the humorous parts is a great scene where all the aliens are all one inch tall. I won't give away what makes that so funny -- you can read it for yourself. <br /> <br />One of the other reviews claims that the book gets \\"all religious\\" in chapter two. That's actually a funny part that I took to have no religious agenda whatsoever. Like most good sci-fi, it's a secular book.
B00005MP58|5.0|MY product came within a week, and I live in Hawaii, and it was in great condition. I love the quality and I have always loved this miniseries since it came out in 1996! It is a great buy, a very low price, most place charge 39.99-for 19.99 plus s&h-which made it 21 something-it's definitely worht it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000MTOKZ0|4.0|Born of the same stock as bands like Blondie, the Ramones, Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground, Bowie, The Cars and The Knack, Television has something unique about their sound that is very addictive and has an edge about it that makes you want to listen to them over and over.<br /><br />The licks and riffs they play are deceptively simple cliches and yet they pull it off brilliantly. Not a single weak track here at all.<br /><br />Now this version has been released in a mini lp replica sleeve design which pretty accurately recreates the original lp design. We all know that for years now, the Japanese have been the masters at mlps cds and they still have the edge over Rhino at least for now. The Japanese have the good sense to include a plastic sleeve for the cd to prevent dust and more importantly scratches from damaging the shiny side of the cd. Otherwise, the outer cardboard sleeve is well done and is good quality unlike some of the other mlps versions I've seen out there that have flimsy or poor quality, thin cardboard covers. I don't actually mind the fact that there are no bonus tracks as I feel that most of the time, bonus tracks do not add to the enjoyment of the original album tracks and many a time actually spoils the listening enjoyment when they are countless outtakes or alternate takes of album tracks or worse interviews and obvious filler material.  Too bad the sound hasn't been remastered as well as the digipak version of this album where the sound quality is still better than it is here.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you don't mind the propensity for the lack of proper plastic protection for the cd to result in scratches on the data/music side of your cd, then for lovers of the mlps format, this may be a worthwhile addition to your other punk rock albums. Overall, I like the whole Rhino Replica idea but I hope they'll take my comments seriously and seek to better protect the discs from damage and also seek to remaster and hence improve the sound quality of future releases. The following are just some of the albums I'd love to see as Rhino Replicas:<br /><br />\\"Harvest\\" - Neil Young<br /><br />\\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\\" - Neil Young<br /><br />\\"Deja Vu\\" - Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young<br /><br />\\"Back In Black\\" - AC/DC<br /><br />\\"Partners In Crime\\" - Rupert Holmes<br /><br />\\"No Goodbyes\\" - Daryl Hall & John Oates<br /><br />\\"Abandoned Luncheonette\\" - Daryl Hall & John Oates<br /><br />\\"Not Fragile\\" - Bachman-Turner Overdrive<br /><br />\\"The White Album\\" - Average White Band<br /><br />\\"Centerfield\\" - John Fogerty<br /><br />(all remastered with plastic cd protecting sleeve in addition to the paper sleeve and please no bonus tracks)ality of future releases.

B000001EC1|4.0|For people who only know Bon Jovi from their \\"Have A Nice Day\\" and beyond years, \\"Cross Road\\" is a very good collection of tunes for them to check out.  It gives the listener a solid set of their most popular tunes from their hair band heyday before they got all earthy/Mellencampy.  This album is by no means a complete gathering of their greatest tunes.  It leaves out at least two songs (\\"Living In Sin\\" and \\"Born To Be My Baby\\") and instead fills those holes with the dismal \\"Prayer '94,\\" the forgettable \\"Always\\" and the harbinger of things to come, \\"Someday I'll Be Saturday Night.\\"  \\"Someday\\" is actually a very good modern roots rocker, but people don't buy greatest hits albums for the new songs.  People buy this album for songs like the original \\"Livin' on a Prayer,\\" \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive,\\" \\"Bad Medicine,\\" and \\"I'll Be There For You.\\"<br /><br />Lesser known tunes from their earliest offerings(particularly \\"Runaway\\") signal the beginnings of a great band to come.  Later songs such as \\"Keep The Faith\\" and \\"Bed Of Roses\\" reveal a band in rock decline and quickly headed for the adult contemporary sound.  In short, \\"Crossroad\\" gives the listener a pretty good take on how a band from Jersey made it big, leveled off, then headed for the sweet and steady success of light rock.  Just to shake things up a bit, \\"Blaze Of Glory\\" from Jon Bon Jovi's solo \\"Young Guns II\\" project is included.  Sadly, we do not get a sample from any of Richie Sambora's solo works.  He really is a much better guitarist than he's given credit for, and it would have been nice for one of his tunes to be included in this collection.<br /><br />I grew up during Bon Jovi's prime, and am proud to say that I own original cassette copies of \\"Slippery When Wet\\" and \\"New Jersey.\\"  Although they weren't my favorite hair/glam/hard rock band (that was Def Leppard), they were still one of the best around at the time.  Bon Jovi is no longer the band they once were, but for people who want to know where they came from, this is the album to pick up.ame from, this is the album to pick up.
B000002JKA|5.0|Most fans will not agree, but this is by far Dream Theater's greatest release.  DT has written some really nice songs and parts of songs since Kevin Moore's exodus, but never an album that was this powerful as a whole.  I like Jordan Rudess, Ill take a dark and brooding Kevin Moore over ragtime piano breakdowns and carnival music any day.  Especially when its paired up with the technical wizardry of John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy. <br /> <br />DT is a great band and Im definitely still a fan, but everytime they come close to the sound on the Awake album (Presence of Enemies Pt2!!) it brings a smile to my face...Now that they're on Road Runner hopefully they'll keep it that way.
B00005QEO1|5.0|Hot on the heels of their successful \\"Permanent Vacation\\" and still enjoying a resurgence as rockers, Aerosmith cranked out \\"Pump.\\"  It is, in my opinion, the best of their second successful run of albums.  While \\"Vacation\\" set the table, \\"Pump\\" kicked things into high gear.  From the opening track, \\"Young Lust,\\" Aerosmith does not let up with their bluesy, dirty, driving sound.  Songs like \\"F.I.N.E.\\" and \\"My Girl\\" solidified this album as real rock, but it was the deep contrasts in their major releases that set this album apart from the pack.  From the socially-conscious and touchy subject of \\"Janie's Got A Gun\\" to the slow, emotional \\"What It Takes\\" to the raw, sex-laden \\"Love In An Elevator,\\" Aerosmith took this album in a million directions and managed to hold it all together.  They also threw in a lot of experimental sounding segues as with \\"Dulcimer Stomp\\" and the wonderful \\"Hoodoo Voodoo Medicine Man.\\"<br /><br />In short, if I had to pick one album from their second run in rock history, I'd have to go with \\"Pump.\\" It proved that older rockers could hang with the best of the young guys at the time and it came before their more homogenized and stale sounding albums like \\"Get A Grip.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Fear of a Blank Planet, with its dark theme of childhood alienation and drug dependence, marks another step in the evolution of the phenomenal Porcupine Tree. They retain their ambient, Pink Floydian roots in songs like \\"My Ashes\\" and in passages of other heavier songs while further developing their aggressive, distortion-laden approach to neo-prog, verging on metal.  <br /> <br />One thing that separates this band from the many progressive metal bands out there is their dynamics. They use their heavy sound to create tension, rather than having it be an overarching approach. This, to my mind, makes them a much more interesting and engaging band. The quality of the musicianship and recording production is top notch and the songs are very visual in the stories they tell and the emotions they evoke. Porcupine Tree's live show isn't a concert in the conventional sense. It's an event, with video projections that are music videos in their own right, with the band playing in perfect synch with the video.  <br /> <br />The first time I listened to Fear of a Blank Planet, I was impressed and I liked it, but I wasn't sure how much. I've had that reaction to many of their albums in the past, and as with those albums, subsequent listens made me grow more and more fond of it. When it ends, I want more, but I also feel satisfied that time invested in listening was worth every second. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes dark-themed music with a lot of emotion, richness and intersting time changes. It's not going to have a broad-based appeal. Many listeners just won't get it. Those who do will be richly rewarded.
B000000OTU|4.0|First and foremost, \\"Big Ones\\" is not a definitive Aerosmith collection.  What it is, however, is a great collection of tunes culled from their second successful run that started in the mid-80's and ran its course through the early 90's.  There are bigger, better, and more complete collections of their hits out there, but for a quick roadtrip, this is the perfect album.  It includes \\"Dude (Look Like A Lady),\\" \\"Janie's Got A Gun,\\" and \\"Amazing.\\"  It also has the wonderful \\"Rag Doll\\" and one of the best hard rock ballads, \\"Angel.\\"  A couple of new tunes are also thrown in, but they can't even begin to overshadow the rest of this album.<br /><br />Naturally hardcore fans will want a more extensive collection of Aerosmith's hits.  In most cases, if you're that much of a fan you've probably got most of their albums anyway.  For people who just want a decent helping of the band's hits though, this album is perfect.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Wow, its really painful for me to have to write a review like this since I've been a big supporter of Linkin Park, especially nice to have former high school classmates do so well, since their amazing album hybrid Theory. That is a 5 star album for sure. It's understandable that a band would try to branch out and make something different but it just doesn't work on this album the way it worked for Green Day and a few other bands. Linkin park changed their core song structure and sound too much.  <br /> <br />The rock songs sound like songs that didn't make the cut on previous albums and lack that linkin park punch. Think papercut or a place for my head and the slow ballads just aren't catchy or emotionally powerful enough. Chester can sing fine but the songs just feel bland and emotionless even if that was not the intent. The slow songs sound like a bad mix of Good Charlotte, Lost Prophets, and Coldplay. Its like the best talents of each individual weren't used and what you get is an average run of the mill sounding CD. <br /> <br />Mike's rapping and the DJ elements are basically non-existant on this album.  <br /> <br />This is the first Linkin Park CD I won't be buying. I gave it a couple listens and nothing really jumped out at me. I felt like it would just get lost in the shuffle. Mike's Fort Minor CD is much better than this album. Hopefully this CD is just a bump in the road. <br /> <br />Hybrid Theory is still a classic and defined a whole genre. I recommend getting that instead if you are a new Linkin Park fan.
0316010669|5.0|There are some books that are the brain equivalent of cotton candy-- satisfying but with no real nutrition.  There are other books that really stretch your brain but also throw it into cramps trying to understand what the book is saying, so you end up grabbing your head shouting \\"ow ow ow!\\"<br /><br />Blink is a great example of a book that really blows your mind without causing it any pain; it is an entertaining, accessible introduction to a fascinating but little known field of research known by various names such as \\"adaptive unconscious\\" \\"thin-slicing\\" or as the author likes to put it \\"thinking without thinking\\" (see, simple words, no brain cramp there!).<br /><br />What is he talking about here?  Simply put, most of us divide our brains into two functional parts, the part that does things like control our muscles and breathing (unconscious) and the part that composes poems, makes mathematical calculations, and decides where to go on vacation (conscious).<br /><br />However, our brains have a third distinct type of function: subconscious processing. Every second we are awake our brains are compiling huge amounts of data that our senses are feeding us, then making complex decisions about that data instantaneously and continuously, then feeding those decisions to us subconsciously.  We don't even realize this is happening-- it's often what we call \\"our gut\\" or \\"intuition,\\" but in reality it is an incredibly sophisticated and powerful processing ability that is beyond anything that a computer can do.<br /><br />Gladwell uses a variety of entertaining, thought-provoking, and sometimes alarming examples of both anecodote and detailed research to open our minds to what our \\"adaptive unconscious\\" is doing for us every day.  For instance, one research project he mentions in the introduction found that,<br /><br />\\"A person watching a silent two-second video clip of a teacher he or she has never met will reach conclusions about how good that teacher is that are very similar to those of a student who has sat in the teacher's class for an entire semester.  That's the power of our adaptive unconscious.\\"<br /><br />So, what does the book cover? Gladwell himself outlines three major tasks that he wanted the book to accomplish:<br /><br />First task: decisions made very quickly (through our subconscious processing abilities) can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.<br /><br />Second task: That we can learn about how this subconscious processing works and when it can be trusted and when to be wary of it.<br /><br />Third task:  that \\"our snap judgements and first impressions can be educated and controlled... as we can teach ourselves to think logically and deliberately (better), we can also teach ourselves to make better snap judgments. The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few.  It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\\"<br /><br />Along the way, the reader is intrigued and entertained by a wide variety of little known research facts about human behavior and thinking.  There is the marriage researcher who can predict divorce with 95% accuracy years before it happens by only listening to a couple have a conversation for a few minutes.  How does he do it?  By focusing on the ratio of conscious and subconscious positive to negative emotion expressed (a ratio any worse than 5:1 positive:negative is bad, and any expression of true contempt is a death knell).<br /><br />Then there is the online test you can take to show whether you have a subconscious prejudice against blacks (80% of whites and even 50% of blacks do). And how you can influence how patient a test subject will be by having them read sentences that have words like \\"patient\\" in them before they have to wait on someone. And his interview with a lady who can separate the taste of Oreos into ninety separate components (eleven of which are critical, we are told!).  And the team thathas calculated every possible anatomic facial expression, what they mean, how some cannot be faken or hidden, and even that the mere act of forming some facial expressions trigger the autonomic nervous system on a subconscious level (in other words, smiling really can make us feel happy!).<br /><br />So, by the time you turn the last page, how well does Gladwell succeed on each of his three tasks?  For task #1, he does great. Time after time he convincingly shows the power and the wonder of our subconscious processing, and how often it is superior to what we normally think of as \\"thinking.\\"  I gained a great deal more respect for the incredible things that my brain does and what an incredible creation of God it is.<br /><br />What about the second task, to understand how this works and when to trust it? This is much harder, because we are just beginning to do serious research on the nature and extent of our subconscious processing.  He gives a few good examples of where our \\"gut\\" doesn't do a good job, such as when evaluating people by stereotypes such as height or race, or having to make certain decisions in rapid high stress situations.  But that's really just the tip of the iceberg regarding the limitations of our subconscious.<br /><br />Unfortunately, with the third task (to make better \\"snap judgements\\") no book can deal definitively, because generally you have to thoroughlly understand how and why something is going wrong to correct it, and our limited understanding of our preconscious really hampers our ability to proactively improve and correct it.<br /><br />All in all, this is an enormously fascinating and entertaining book that is both an important and a fun read for anyone.  To better understand both the power, extent, and limitation of how we \\"think without thinking\\" is of value to all of us. Unconditionally recommended.the team that has calculated every possible anatomic facial expression, what they mean, how some cannot be faken or hidden, and even that the mere act of forming some facial expressions trigger the autonomic nervous system on a subconscious level (in other words, smiling really can make us feel happy!). <br /> <br />So, by the time you turn the last page, how well does Gladwell succeed on each of his three tasks?

0385340559|5.0|The story line has already been overly discussed in previous reviews, so I will not further elaborate on it.  I have read all of the Jack Reacher novels and feel that this one had by far more 'mystery' then all of the previous books.  Obiously implausible at times...but this book is 'extremely' entertaining.

B000089QEN|5.0|If you are considering a dramatic rendition of Vanity Fair, this BBC production is definitely the most superior.  Becky Sharpe is played by Natasha Little and it is a wonder this actor has not been seen much since: She is magnificent in this role - manipulative, delightful and 'Sharpe as a tack' as Thackeray intended.  (Nb.  she actually played the part of the sweet natured Lady Jane Sheepshanks in the US film where Reese Witherspoon took the main role).  Take note of all the names: Dobbin is supposed to suggest a plodding loyalty, Becky IS sharpe and Lord Steyne is indeed a stain on morality!<br /><br />The costumes and settings are so realistic that some history documentaries have used sections of this mini-series to illustrate the battle of Waterloo.<br /><br />When it was originally televised here it obtained almost cult status, each episode was eagerly and impatiently awaited.  I have TWO copies of the mini-series on video and am very happy to now own it on DVD.<br /><br />Ignore the American production starring Reese Witherspoon, the BBC's Becky carries the day.  Regardless of these opinions, the series is also a valuable historical documentary with insights into class, daily life and Waterloo.  It is superbly entertaining also.

B000M5AJQS|3.0|You have probably already come to grips with the fact that when you go to see a new Scorsese film, it's not going to be another \\"Taxi Driver.\\" Without the burden of comparison to classic Scorsese works, \\"The Departed\\" is an enjoyable thriller with an all-star cast, some of whom deliver better than others.  <br /> <br />On the subject of the cast, there is, of course, Jack Nicholson as Costello. Nicholson is a master of playing characters which are simultaneously disgusting and compelling, and this role is no exception. There's lots of great dialog in this film for Nicholson. <br /> <br />On the other end of the scale is Matt Damon, who seems a little weak in this film. There are a number of moments in the film where he pulls out the Good Will Hunting, and you think to yourself \\"Oh Geez.\\" I am a fan of Damon's, but this role did not seem to be a great fit. <br /> <br />Mark Wahlberg's role is a relatively minor one, but it is one of the film's highlights. He is excellent as the extremely vulgar and abusive Sgt. Dignam, of whom I wanted to see more. <br /> <br />The best part of the film, though, is Leonardo DiCaprio, who's central performance as Billy Costigan is excellent to the point that Matt Damon seems diminished in the complementary role of Colin Sullivan. <br /> <br />As for the plot, I am told that this film is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film entitled \\"Infernal Affairs.\\"  It is the story of two moles; a police mole in the mob, and a mob mole in the police. The suspense lies in who will discover whom first. <br /> <br />If I had one major complaint about the film, it was that the script did not sufficiently (in my opinion) convey the motivation of DiCaprio's character. What motivated him to endure such a harrowing, dangerous, life-wrecking enterprise? <br /> <br />One last thing, I just remembered that Alec Baldwin is in the film, and he is quite good as well!
B000OCXFCO|5.0|That fiasco of Metallica called 'Some Kind Of Monster that that idiot dolt of a drummer in Lars Ulrich caused and listening to parts of St. Anger (that I do not own and did not buy because it was such a disaster) I can see why Dave Mustaine left Metallica early on because I think Dave became more successful afterwards regardless of the fact that he has some short [...] sessions on that DVD of Monster about Megadeth being or equaling up to Metallica (which I think was a crock of you know what). Ulrich cost the band fans after he did that stupid move of charging them with stealing because of Napster after they became millionaires and I was lucky enough to see Cliff Burton on the Master of Puppets tour opening up for Ozzy Osbourne in Fort Worth Texas before he died overseas in that tragic accident. I don't hardly listen to them anymore because of that. There music got weak after James Hetfield walked out and I think that Lars caused that too because I was watching the looks on his face like he blamed everyone else and I could see it.<br /><br /> laughingpig1@yahoo.com

B000N6U0E2|5.0|Moviegoers don't have to wait for Atlas Shrugged to view a riveting drama about the heroics of a business entrepreneur. Actor Will Smith shines in his portrayal of a real-life, self-made investment broker in this emotionally exhausting but ultimately inspiring biopic. <br /> <br />It's the 1981 recession, and Chris Gardner struggles to make ends meet as a self-employed medical-equipment salesman who has a family to support in San Francisco. With a stack of bone-density scanners gathering dust in his efficiency apartment kitchen, and with wife Linda (Thandie Newton) pulling double shifts at a neighborhood laundry, he can barely pay the bills. Chris spends his days shuttling his five-year-old son, Christopher, to day care (the film's title refers to Chris's constantly nagging the owner of the day-care center to correct the word's spelling on a mural there) and trying to hawk his expensive equipment to doctors and hospitals with shrinking budgets. <br /> <br />Looking for a way out of his dead-end job, Chris spots a well-heeled businessman (Geoff Callan) parking a red Ferrari and quizzes him. \\"Man, I've got two questions for you: What do you do, and how do you do it?\\" The man informs him he's a stock broker with the prestigious Dean Witter Reynolds firm and that he's \\"good with numbers and people.\\" <br /> <br />Suddenly, Chris sees his life as it could be. Watching the men and women exiting the brokerage house, he reflects, \\"They all looked so damned happy to me,\\" and wonders, \\"Why couldn't I look like that?\\" After impressing one of the senior brokers (Brian Howe) by solving a Rubik's Cube puzzle during a taxicab ride, Chris applies for a Dean Witter internship program and lands an interview. <br /> <br />However, all that Linda can see in Chris's decision to become a broker is a pipe dream. \\"Salesman to intern is backwards,\\" she protests. Unable to handle the stress of the landlord breathing down their necks for back rent, she leaves, forcing Chris to raise their sonalone. As if that weren't enough, on the night before his big interview with Dean Witter, the police show up at his doorstep to arrest him for a pile of unpaid parking tickets. <br /> <br />After spending the night in the police lockup, Chris--disheveled, wearing jeans and a tank-top undershirt--barely makes it to his interview on time. \\"I could not think of a lie bizarre enough,\\" he explains awkwardly to his skeptical interviewers. \\"I just got out of jail for unpaid parking tickets and my wife left me.\\" One asks him: \\"What if a man walked in here with no shirt, and I gave him a job?\\" Chris replies good-naturedly: \\"He must've had on some really nice pants.\\" <br /> <br />Chris lands a spot in the internship program, not by bluffing his way out of the awkward situation, but through his forthright honesty and sense of humor.   However, there's a catch--the internship is unpaid and will last six months. Even after the program ends, there are no guarantees: only one intern out of twenty will be hired by the firm. <br /> <br />Already having moved with his son into a hotel room to save money, Chris is faced with the dilemma of either trying to provide fully for his son right away or taking the chance that after a half-year he'll land a salaried position as an investment broker. Figuring that he can make rent and keep Christopher in day care if he can sell just one bone-density scanner a month after work and on weekends, he decides to go for it. (In this regard, the movie takes a little dramatic license: In Chris Gardner's real life, the internship paid a small stipend each month, and he quit his job selling the scanners when he took the internship; he was not self-employed.) <br /> <br />But his troubles are just starting. When the IRS seizes his checking account for back taxes, Chris and his boy are evicted from their hotel room. With only the clothes on their backs, they are turned out on the streets. But whether sleeping on subways, buses, or in luncheonette booths, Chris never leaves Christopher's side or reveals a hint of discouragement. <br /> <br />As much as The Pursuit of Happyness is the story of Chris Gardner's struggle to succeed in the business world, it's also the story of a father's love for and commitment to his child. At their lowest point--forced to spend the night sleeping on the floor of a men's room in a train station--he never lets on to his boy that their state is desperate, even as he's about to go to pieces. Much like the Roberto Benigni character in 1997's Life Is Beautiful, Chris conceals the indignity of their situation from his youngster by playing a make-believe game of hiding from cavemen and dinosaurs. The scenes between father and son are among the movie's most natural, convincing, and genuinely moving, no doubt because of the bond between Will Smith and his real-life son Jaden, who plays Christopher. <br /> <br />At one point, while shooting hoops at a neighborhood playground, Chris realizes the power that an adult's words can have on a child. He makes a self-effacing quip, telling Christopher not to bother spending too much time working on his game because he himself was never any good at basketball, either. The boy puts down the ball and slumps in resignation. Angry at himself for his own thoughtlessness, Chris counsels his son: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Don't ever let someone tell you you can't do something! Not even me!. . . .You got a dream, you gotta protect it! People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you that you can't do it. You want something? Go get it. Period! <br /> <br />What makes this movie ring so true is that Chris Gardner heeds his own advice, even though he seems trapped in an inescapable maze. Constantly down but never out, he refuses to slink away and abandon his dream. His quest becomes a frantic chase: rushing to catch buses, arriving late at sales calls, picking up his son from daycare, tracking down a bone scanner that some hippies stole from him, securing a place to sleep in a homeless shelter. But homelessness is never depicted--or regarded--as more than a transient condition. And Chris Gardner is always in transit: everywhere he goes, he's running. Indeed, I believe Smith spends more screen time running than Dustin Hoffman did in the 1976 thriller Marathon Man. <br /> <br />Unlike the anti-business messages conveyed by so many of today's movies, this film depicts the business world as gruelingly tough, but ultimately fair--even liberating. Most refreshing are the scenes showing Chris in the Dean Witter internship program. I cheered to myself as he applied his quick head for numbers, shaving seconds off \\"cold calls\\" by not hanging up between phone conversations and by going straight to the top of a company's contact directory rather than starting at the bottom, as is customary. <br /> <br />In many respects, The Pursuit of Happyness reminded me of business-themed comedies from the 1980s, such as Trading Places and Working Girl, but without the bitter \\"getting even with the boss\\" side plots. If anything, the movie extols the productive nature of the stock market while regarding government as the parasite. While talking with a prospect who wants a retirement fund that yields high returns but low taxes, Gardner quips, \\"So, basically, you don't want nobody's hands in your pockets but your own.\\" <br /> <br />Italian director Gabriele Muccino--best known for his 2001 romantic comedy The Last Kiss--adapts his lighthearted style effortlessly to this somewhat weighty story, his first American film. Meanwhile, director of photography Phedon Papamichael exploits the steep streets of San Francisco and Oakland as a metaphor to capture the ups and downs of Chris's world. In the Dean Witter offices, Papamichael's camera moves left-to-right, visually conveying the business world's virtues of drive, economy, and progression. For his part, Will Smith digs deep into his dramatically demanding role, giving his most forceful performance todate. Is this really the same easy-going guy who starred in \\"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\\" and Men in Black? <br /> <br />As for the real-life Chris Gardner, today he is a multi-millionaire who runs an investment firm in Chicago. Speaking about this stirring, feel-good movie (which, ironically, is at times also one of the bleakest movies I've ever seen), Gardner hailed the ability of Smith and director Muccino to capture life \\"when the whole world tells you how small you are, but you see how big you really can be.\\" <br /> <br />And big he is. The Pursuit of Happyness is one of the most positive and heroic portraits of a businessman that I've ever seen. The choices that Chris Gardner makes under the most trying of circumstances reveal his indomitable, optimistic resolve and character. Smith, who produced as well as starred, first seized upon the idea of making this movie after seeing an ABC \\"20/20\\" profile of Gardner. \\"Chris represents the American Dream,\\" he remarked. \\"The promise of America is such a great idea. Nowhere else in the world could a Chris Gardner exist.\\" <br /> <br />And, I might add, nowhere else in the world could a movie honoring a Chris Gardner exist.

B000M4RG42|3.0|Clint Eastwood is arguably our greatest living motion picture director. Thirty-five years after his directorial debut in the Hitchcock homage Play Misty for Me (1971), the silent, gritty actor who learned his filmmaking craft at the feet of such masters as Sergio Leone and Don Siegel has produced a body of work sweeping in variety of subject matter, yet singular in its artistic vision. While many of his contemporaries have slipped in critical esteem--most notably Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese--the two-time Oscar-winning director of Million Dollar Baby (2004) and Unforgiven (1992) has only improved with age. <br /> <br />Until now. In his latest cinematic offering, Eastwood misses the mark with this loose, relentlessly dark, and ultimately cynical adaptation of James Bradley's book of the same name. <br /> <br />The book was a tribute to the six Marines (one of them his father, John \\"Doc\\" Bradley) who raised Old Glory atop Mount Suribachi on the Japanese volcanic island of Iwo Jima, on February 23, 1945. Bradley's work chronicles the life stories of these six--three who survived the carnage that claimed almost 7,000 American lives: John Bradley, Ira Hayes, and Rene Gagnon; plus the three who perished: Franklin Sousley, Harlon Block, and Mike Strank. Of the survivors, none considered himself heroic for raising the flag or even for his deeds in combat. John Bradley shunned talk about the war, and it was only after his passing that son James found a shoebox in the family's attic containing mementos, most notably a Navy Cross. \\"Doc\\" Bradley, a corpsman (Navy lingo for \\"medic\\"), had resuscitated a wounded Marine during a fierce firefight while his own body was ripped by Japanese shrapnel. Yet it was not for bravery that Bradley and his comrades were immortalized after the war, but rather for their chance appearance in Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal's iconic image--perhaps the most recognizable photograph in history, taken on the fifth day of the bloodiest battle of World War II. <br /> <br />Their individual achievements, identity, and dignity eventually became subsumed in the aura of the legend created by \\"The Photo.\\" Through their stories, Bradley's exhaustively researched book gently prods the reader to consider the true nature of heroism. He pens a moving historical account, shedding light on the real lives of six individuals who rose to greatness despite their flaws and despite history's tendency to transform them into anonymous symbols of heroic virtue. <br /> <br />It's a powerful message which, sadly, gets mangled in Eastwood's overreaching screen adaptation. Although many of the elements of Bradley's account make it onscreen, in Eastwood's hands Flags of Our Fathers becomes a documelodrama--a ghastly tragedy that subverts the humanity of Bradley's account, becoming an overwrought portrait of the three surviving flag-raisers as victims. <br /> <br />To be sure, an interesting portrait it is--a story that promises to grab you by the heart and never let go. After Rosenthal's photo blazes across the front pages of America's newspapers, Bradley, Gagnon, and Hayes are whisked up by a cynical public relations machine to shill war bonds to a war-weary America. Though taking up only sixteen of the book's 382 pages, the war bond drive comprises the bulk of the film's plot and onscreen action. <br /> <br />The book treats the \\"Mighty 7th\\" War Loan bond drive ambivalently, though mostly positively. The drive raised over $26.3 billion from American individuals, families, and businesses--almost half of the 1946 fiscal year federal budget of $56 billion--thus making it possible to rearm the military to force Japan's defeat in the war's final months. \\"When I spoke with a Treasury Department source by telephone to confirm these figures,\\" Bradley writes, \\"the official marveled over the size and accomplishments of the Mighty 7th. He fell silent for a moment as he shuffled some papers on his desk. Then he said, simply:`We were one then.'\\" Indeed, without victory at Iwo Jima and the funds raised by the bond drive, the second most recognizable WWII photo--Alfred Eisenstaedt's August 15, 1945 shot of a returning sailor planting a big, juicy kiss on a nurse in Times Square on VJ Day--might never have been taken. <br /> <br />But Eastwood fixates on the bond drive, taking its highs and lows to distill a potent concoction of pure misery. His account depicts the men's whirlwind, whistle-stop tour of America's metropolises as a slick, gaudy sideshow run by contemptuous PR men. It's a chronicle of exploiting the flag-raisers by having them climb atop a papier-mâché Mount Suribachi to raise the red, white, and blue--of tastelessly serving ice cream molded in the shape of the raising--of glad-handing businessmen and politicians who seek to use the men for their own profit. <br /> <br />Marine Private Ira Hayes becomes the movie's conscience during all the ballyhoo. \\"I think this whole goddamn thing is a farce, if you ask me,\\" he mutters. Yet the book version gives little such evidence of Hayes's revulsion. In one scene from the book, a politician introduces Hayes (a Pima American Indian) as \\"the only man here who can claim to be a real American.\\" In the film version, actor Adam Beach reacts mostly silently and stoically. Perhaps Eastwood felt that Hayes's reaction in real life, in which he strode up to the microphone and exclaimed, \\"I'm an Indian and I'm damn proud of it,\\" would have undermined his effort to portray Hayes as a hapless victim of constant racial slurs. <br /> <br />The look and feel of the movie also serve to evince Eastwood's dark artistic agenda. A pall of foreboding darkness permeates not only the grueling battle scenes but even the movie's happier moments (e.g., coming back home to family, or Bradley marrying his childhood sweetheart), rendering them at best bittersweet. Director of photography Tom Stern filmed Flags of Our Fathers almost monochromatically, in swathes of rich cobalt blue, muting the other hues of the spectrum in the color timing. <br /> <br />However, the movie's chief flaw is in its confused narrative structure, told mostly by overusing flashbacks. Eastwood and editor Joel Cox used flashback montages to great effect in 1995's The Bridges of Madison County, but they don't quite pull it off here. As a viewer, I felt like a ping-pong ball paddled between the bond rallies and the battle scenes; by the middle of the film, I could already anticipate that a newspaper photographer's blinding flashbulb at a stadium appearance would cut right to a nighttime flare or exploding ordnance as one of the three soldiers relived the hell of war. <br /> <br />Although Eastwood captures the gory reality of the battle scenes, he never offers the viewer the reason for capturing Iwo Jima, or details of the genuinely heroic exploits of the twenty-two Marines and five sailors who were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor (the most given in any single battle in the history of American warfare). Furthermore, even after more than two hours, the viewer never really gets to know as individuals Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) or Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), not to mention the three flag-raisers who died. <br /> <br />The only thing that resonated with me at all was Adam Beach's moving performance as Ira Hayes. It's a tragic story of alcoholic despair and guilt that so many fellow Marines died while he was spared, ending with his loss of dignity and untimely death. Yet Hayes's story is poignant only as a vignette within an otherwise two-dimensional film and deserved fuller development, along the lines of Eastwood's biopic of saxophonist Charlie Parker, Bird (1988). <br /> <br />James Bradley closes his book by conveying great respect for his father's modest request to posterity: <br /> <br />After spending five years researching their lives, the boys certainly seem like heroes to me. I admit it. <br />But I must defer to my father.... I will take my dad's word for it: Mike, Harlon, Franklin, Ira, Rene, and Doc, the men of Easy Company--they just did what anybody would have done, and they were not heroes. <br /> <br />Not heroes. <br /> <br />They were boys of common virtue. Called to duty. Brothers and sons. Friends and neighbors. And fathers. It's as simple as that. <br /> <br />Anyone who had a friend or loved one who fought in World War II recognizes this modesty as a hallmark of that generation. My adopted godfather, Nick, a crusty old Marine who served in Guadalcanal, told me a thousand war stories, most of which involved goofing off with dames and alcohol, hitching rides back home on furlough, reminiscing about buddies who never made it back, playing practical jokes on each other. He never spoke about combat, though. <br /> <br />Nick was a real-life hero to me. I have no idea what he did to earn a chestful of ribbons, and I never asked him, because I figured that if he ever wanted me to know, he'd tell me. But he never did. And it never really mattered, because I learned from him that real heroes don't blow their own horn. <br /> <br />            Eastwood's version of their story is ultimately a deconstruction of their heroism. He basically writes off the heroic with a relativistic cliché--\\"Everyone likes things nice and simple--good and evil, heroes and villains\\"--and ends with a bitter lament: \\"Maybe there is no such thing as heroes.\\" Even Sergeant Sefton, Billy Wilder's cynic extraordinaire in the 1953 film Stalag 17, could become a hero with a heart of gold; but in Flags of Our Fathers, Eastwood performs a sort of reverse alchemy, chucking out gold nuggets while panning for mud. <br /> <br />            If Eastwood's aspirations were merely artistic, I'd regard Flags of Our Fathers as a flawed classic. But it's worse than that, because he has an agenda. He subverts the truth of these individuals' stories to craft a political message of exploitation. In doing so, Eastwood transforms Bradley, Gagnon,and Hayes into a sotto voce symbolic rebuke for the \\"Mission Accomplished\\" banner aboard the U.S.S. Lincoln aircraft carrier in 2003, when former Texas Air National Guard fighter pilot and current president George W. Bush co-piloted a Navy SB-3 Viking to mark victory in the Iraq war. Sure, I thought Bush was undignified in doing that, because although he had never served in combat a day in his life, he cast himself as some kind of returning war hero. The credit for that victory rightfully should have gone to those brave warriors who actually stood in harm's way. <br /> <br />That said, I found it highly ironic that despite Eastwood's strident crowing against the (mostly imaginary) exploitation of Bradley, Gagnon, and Hayes, he himself, having an ideological axe to grind, would exploit and trivialize these heroes over sixty years later. <br /> <br />Unlike in Unforgiven, his deconstruction of the \\"Western myth,\\" there is neither riveting drama nor stellar acting (with the exception of Beach) evident in Flags of Our Fathers to allow it to withstand the test of time. By belittling the heroism of its subjects, this flick will more than likely be regarded as one of Clint Eastwood's minor works, alongside forgettable movies like Blood Work (2002) and True Crime (1999).
B000OCXMAE|3.0|If you can get past the concept of this being Linkin Park, its an OK album.  The CD is ok, its just WAY different than what you'd expect from a Linkin Park CD.  If you've heard \\"What I've Done\\", its one of the heaviest songs on the CD (hard to believe, I know).  The change from Meteora to Minutes to Midnight is about the equivalent of Deftones change from Around the Fur to White Pony.  Instead of new-age metal with hints of rap and techno, this CD more resembles a smooth jazz band.  Decent CD if you're looking for easy listening.  Every song could be done with just Chester and a pianist without losing much of its feel.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|For years, (strictly as a guilty pleasure, you see), I haunted my local multiplex to revel repeatedly in the serial cinematic exploits of Sylvester Stallone's most famous celluloid hero. Yes, I hereby confess that I actually enjoyed all those Rocky movies with Roman numerals in their titles. I even sort-of liked Rocky V (1990), the one that all the film critics mock.<br /><br />But that's because I'm not a \\"film critic,\\" you see; I'm a movie enthusiast. Although I'm nominally Roman Catholic, my true religion is that uniquely American art form known as motion pictures. Every Friday night that devotion draws me to the services conducted at the local mission--the Mission Drive-In Theater in San Antonio, that is--where I take communion, comprised of hot-buttered popcorn and a Coca-Cola slushy. In the lobby, posing proudly amid my pantheon of movie gods--right there with blown-up images of heroes portrayed by John Wayne, Charlton Heston, Robert Mitchum, Burt Lancaster, and Gregory Peck--stands Sylvester Stallone's enduring creation: the quintessential American underdog, Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />For more than thirty years, Stallone has never been given his proper due as a screenwriter. Recently, for the first time in over a decade, I watched a DVD of his original, low-budget sleeper, Rocky (1976). I was struck all over again by the masterpiece of understated, eloquent drama that Stallone and director John G. Avildsen had put up on the screen. The tale of the small-time pugilist and loan shark's enforcer with the soft spot in his heart, who gets his miracle shot at the heavyweight boxing championship on America's Bicentennial, Rocky became the unlikely winner of the 1976 Academy Award for Best Picture--and an instant classic.<br /><br />To a great extent, Rocky worked so well because of its indelibly memorable supporting cast. There was Talia Shire as Adrian, the painfully shy pet shop cashier and the object of Rocky's affections. There was legendary character actor Burgess Meredith in the role of his lifetime as Mickey, Rocky's elderly, cantankerous trainer, whose fatherly devotion inspired the lowly club fighter to believe in himself. There was Burt Young as drunken leech Paulie, Adrian's bullying brother. Here were people taken from Stallone's own tough childhood in South Philly, made even more real through brutally honest dialogue and poignant situations. But no matter how lowly or bad, they and all the other characters in the film--even the loan shark (played by Joe Spinell)--got caught up in Rocky's quest and ultimately redeemed themselves. Their lines and gestures were so simply, beautifully, economically imparted that, at times, they seemed to rise to poetry.<br /><br />In one scene, Rocky visits the boxing gymnasium to ask Mickey why he's been running him down for so many years. Mickey snorts back at his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, \\"Ya don't wanna know!\\" When Rocky presses him, the old man unleashes all the fury he can still muster:<br /><br />\\"Okay, I'm gonna tell ya! You had the talent to become a good fighter, but instead of that, you become a leg-breaker to some cheap, second-rate loan shark!\\"<br /><br />\\"It's a living,\\" Rocky mumbles.<br /><br />\\"It's a waste of life!\\" Mickey roars back.<br /><br />Along with other memorable scenes, that one--with the pain and anguish on Burgess Meredith's face revealing his heartbreak over the younger boxer's unfulfilled promise--could easily have been scripted by such dramatic luminaries as Budd Shulberg, Paddy Chayefsky, or Rod Serling.<br /><br />The film has left its enduring stamp on the culture. The steep flight of steps that rises up to the Philadelphia Museum of Art has become one of the most-visited attractions in the city. There, tourists re-create Rocky's ascent during his famous training scene, pumping their own fists in imitation upon reaching the summit. These rituals are a testament to an iconic character that millions worldwide regard as the embodiment of their highest aspirations and deepest dreams. Rocky Balboa reminds them that within them lives the power to make their own dreams real--if they only put as much heart into pursuing their goals as he did when he stepped into the ring against Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), giving everything he had and more.<br /><br />Sadly, the Rocky series is generally held in low critical esteem, largely because of subsequent inferior installments. Although Rocky II (1979) was an excellent sequel (after losing a split decision in the first movie, Rocky finally won the title from Creed in the second), the following two films (1982 and 1985) pitted Rocky against flamboyant, cartoonishly indomitable opponents (played by the scowling Mr. T and the stone-silent Dolph Lundgren, respectively). Fun stuff, but nothing to rival the first two. The fifth film (1990) was a complete letdown, a tired, anticlimactic outing about Rocky Balboa in retirement, down on his luck and dealing with the challenges of fatherhood.<br /><br />Sixteen years after that fizzle, were you expecting yet another Rocky? I certainly wasn't. But happily, Stallone has returned to first principles. Avoiding the predictable Roman numeral \\"VI\\" and simply using the lead character's name as its title, Rocky Balboa focuses once again on the essence of its protagonist, regarding him as a man first, and a boxer second.<br /><br />The movie takes its place with several other film series that recently have gone back to basics and started to take their heroes seriously: Batman Begins (2005), last year's Superman Returns, and the new film of Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, Casino Royale. Unlike those blockbusters, though, this picture doesn't try to recapture its early magic by casting a younger man in the hero's role: instead, it audaciously asks the viewer to take seriously the prospect of a man pushing sixty, yet becoming a contender for the heavyweight championship of the world.<br /><br />It opens with Rocky visiting the grave of his dead wife Adrian (Talia Shire once again, in flashbacks). She died of \\"woman cancer,\\" as the Rock describes it. Every year on their anniversary, he takes a sentimental journey through the old neighborhood, visiting landmarks from their first meeting and dates, dragging the insufferable Paulie in tow. As he reminisces, you see that her absence has broken his heart. Yet Adrian remains omnipresent throughout the movie, as the spirit that moves him on.<br /><br />Visiting an old watering hole, he runs across a girl from the neighborhood, Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a single mom trying to raise a teenaged son and make ends meet by tending bar. A comely lass with the map of Ireland twinkling in her eyes, she and Rocky clumsily, tentatively, spark a relationship. Rocky meanwhile becomes a mentor to her son (James Francis Kelly III), keeping him on the straight-and-narrow.<br /><br />Otherwise, the former champ leads a predictable, comfortable life running an Italian restaurant, greeting and regaling patrons with old stories of past bouts and glories. His whiny twentysomething son, Robert (Milo Ventimiglia), complains about living in Rocky's shadow while he tries to make it in the business world. Rocky gives him the kind of speech fathers stopped giving their boys a couple generations ago, but should resume giving:<br /><br />The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows! It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you.

This wounds the champ's pride: he's gotten to the top by defeating a bunch of has-beens and fall guys, never facing a real challenger for his championship belt.<br /><br />\\"All of boxing is hoping for a warrior who can thrill us with his passion,\\" a ringside announcer carps as Dixon defeats another chump. Desperate for respect, his handlers pitch the idea of a pay-per-view exhibition fight in Las Vegas between their man and the legend who hasn't been in the fight game for twenty-one years.<br /><br />After a few awkward moments mid-movie, there's The Rest . . . and, well, you can pretty much guess the rest. Our Rocky begins training hard, old-school style.

Since Rocky is too old and stiff to bob and weave, his corner man, Duke (Tony Burton), counsels: \\"So, every time you hit him, you got to make a dent. . . .

B000AP04L0|5.0|That happy day when you finally graduate college and enter the workforce is upon you. You're eagerly anticipating putting your education to good use in an important, meaningful job; having an inspiring boss who will help you reach the full limits of your potential; mingling with interesting, supportive coworkers; and, of course, bringing home a big paycheck. <br /> <br />Get real. As the tagline for the hilarious \\"Office Space\\" so aptly puts it, \\"Work sucks.\\" The live-action writing and directing debut of Mike Judge (creator of the \\"Beavis & Butthead\\" MTV series) is a hilarious tale of office doldrums that showcases what life is, sadly, often like in the workplace. <br /> <br />Ron Livingston (Mikey's friend Rob in \\"Swingers\\") plays down-on-his-luck Peter Gibbons, a 20-something who hates his job and is on the outs with his girlfriend. In a highly amusing opening sequence, Peter unsuccessfully battles some horrendous traffic on the way to work, and then arrives to his cubicle just in time to be lectured by his superiors for a tiny, inconsequential error he made. <br /> <br />It's a brutal day in the life of Peter, but unfortunately it's become the norm. However, when Peter goes to a counseling session with his girlfriend, an unexpected turn of events leads him to a new life philosophy: He doesn't give a s---. He disregards his boss' request that he work during the weekend, hangs up the phone on his (soon-to-be ex) girlfriend, and successfully asks out an attractive waitress he's had his eye on (\\"Friends'\\" Jennifer Aniston). Most significantly, he teams up with two of his coworkers, Samir (Ajay Naidu) and the unfortunately named Michael Bolton (David Herman), in a scam that will potentially screw the company out of thousands of dollars. <br /> <br />With the sharply written \\"Office Space,\\" Mike Judge proves he's more than a one-note wonder by doing a superb job of capturing the malaise of the typical office environment. His most impressive directorial touch is an instantly classic scene in which Peter, Samir and Michael carry the office copying machine to a deserted field and literally kick the crap out of it. Shot in slo-mo and set to a gangsta rap tune, this scene is pure comic genius. <br /> <br />Livingston is a good comedic actor who has the talent to become a star in the mold of Matthew Broderick. He gets solid support from Naidu, Herman and Aniston (who deserves credit for taking a small role in this low-budget pic), as well as Gary Cole, who gives a top-notch performance as Peter's super-anal, monotone-voiced boss. <br /> <br />Whether you're a student looking for an amusing preview of what's in store for you on the job scene, or an unfortunate sap who's currently experiencing the hell of working in an office, you should get plenty of laughs from the excellent \\"Office Space.\\"
B000FS9FCQ|2.0|Much more hilarious than Thank You for Smoking--though unintentionally so--is V for Vendetta, the latest installment of the Wachowski brothers's downward slide into formulaic banality. Directed by James McTeigue, the veteran first assistant director of such fare as Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and the Matrix trilogy, V is his first directing effort in which nobody but himself can be blamed for monumental ineptness. <br /> <br />Upon its release, V for Vendetta sparked a lot of debate among libertarians and Objectivists about its anarchistic and nihilistic themes, and from that vantage point I was prepared to write this review. Easier said than done. After viewing nearly all four hours of this CGI special effects extravaganza (during which, inexplicably, the hands on my watch moved only two hours and twelve minutes), I scarcely found any dialogue coherent enough to be debated. <br /> <br />Set in the England of the future, V for Vendetta centers around its \\"hero,\\" V, played by Hugo Weaving. V is a refined man of culture (after all, who doesn't enjoy hearing Julie London sing \\"Cry Me a River\\"?), who surrounds himself with now-banned books. For you see, the great Fortress has been taken over by \\"Norsefire,\\" a fascist theocracy. Its leader, Chancellor Adam Sutler, is a neo-conservative turned Big Brother, played by John Hurt. Just so the subtle novelty of a fuming and spitting despot who governs by Jumbotron isn't lost on the viewer, the makeup people made certain to give Hurt a shortish-cropped mustache and a slicked-back shock of hair reminiscent of a certain Austrian corporal we all know and love. <br /> <br />Against this repressive backdrop, V nurses a four-hundred-year-old chip on his shoulder about the hanging of Guy Fawkes, who in 1605 tried to blow up the British Parliament. V also has a laundry list of personal grudges: he survived a secret government biological warfare experiment gone awry, as well as burns over one hundred percent of his body.<br /> <br />All of this is meant to guarantee the viewer's sympathy for V's sociopathic killing spree as a knife-wielding assassin and mad bomber. After curfew, he prowls London's streets, avenging Norsefire's innocent victims. He hides behind a plaster Guy Fawkes mask, which appears rather stiff, though not as stiff as Weaving's acting. <br /> <br />V happens upon our damsel-in-distress, Evey Hammond, played by the waifish Natalie Portman, whom he rescues from a back-alley rape at the hands of the curfew police, in a deftly-choreographed, computer-generated bloodletting by stainless-steel daggers that produce the requisite \\"swoosh\\" and \\"chunk\\" sound effects. V sure moves pretty fast and furious for someone who's suffered one-hundred-percent body burns. According to the actuarial tables, he shouldn't be moving at all; but that's a moot point. <br /> <br />After dispensing with the goon squad, V introduces himself to Evey by way of an alliterative soliloquy containing forty-seven words beginning with the letter \\"V.\\" It's meant to be charming and chivalrous, but comes off more like Snidely Whiplash doing a Jesse Jackson impression. V then asks Evey to accompany him for a night on the town, whereupon he blows up that citadel of British jurisprudence, the Old Bailey. Talk about fireworks on a first date! <br /> <br />The next day, the government takes credit for his dynamiting job, claiming that Old Bailey was condemned as unsafe. Unfortunately, another side effect that V suffered in prison was an abiding and strident narcissism; so he takes over television broadcast studios to inform Londoners that he blew up Old Bailey, and that in one year--on the day Guy Fawkes burns in effigy--he will level Parliament. Through another subtle plot twist--Evey just happens to work as a gofer at the TV studio (surprise!)--V manages to sweep her up as his innocent accomplice. This sets up the tedium that follows, right up to the anticipated anticlimactic climax. <br /> <br />V for Vendetta doesn't just rip off George Orwell's 1984; that would imply some sort of thematic unity. Rather, this schizophrenic action pic is a pastiche of at least a dozen works far greater than itself. When not squiring Evey about his secret lair a lá The Phantom of the Opera, V hunts down the bastards responsible for his fate in pale homage to The Count of Monte Cristo, while inciting the people to take back their country in a side plot embarrassingly reminiscent of that other \\"V\\"--the 1983 TV mini-series about invading aliens from outer space. The film snitches from cinematic styles and genres, too. There's even a flashback that seamlessly melds the innocence of awakening lesbian passion with lush Merchant-Ivory cinematography from the 1920s. <br /> <br />Amidst all the slow-mo slicing and dicing, V is fond of chiding his deserving prey that \\"ideas do matter.\\" In his televised appeal to the people, he lays the blame for their loss of liberty where it properly belongs, at their own feet. The film's tagline--\\"People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people\\"--is a rather Jeffersonian conception that rings with the spirit of limited government. <br /> <br />Yet for all its nods to individual liberty, V for Vendetta fetishizes freedom through its direct advocacy of anarchy. Justifying his annihilation of Parliament, V argues that \\"the world doesn't need a building, it needs an idea\\"--patently ignoring the ideas of common law and representative democracy that very building embodies. Thus we are brought to V's conclusion: By destroying the betrayed institutions of democracy, somehow, the people will regain their freedom. <br /> <br />This is an obscenity to anyone who remembers his World War II history. From Parliament's halls, Winston Churchill rallied Britons in their \\"finest hour\\" to face down Hitler's Third Reich on the eve of the Battle of Britain. In their sick revision, however, the Wachowskis defeat the Nazis by leveling Parliament--never mind the fact that the Nazis burned down the Germans' Reichstag to consolidate power. <br /> <br />Despite V's pompously vague appeals to the power of ideas, all that viewers are left with is a lot of the moral relativity piffle that leftist professors are so fond of quoting, to the effect that \\"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.\\" Substitute the World Trade Center and the Pentagon for Old Bailey and Parliament, and you'll get the drift of this sickening allegory. <br /> <br />Or, to drive the point closer to home, substitute, in Parliament's place, Columbine High School in suburban Denver. Before the murderous rage in which Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris massacred twelve schoolmates and a teacher, they produced an amateur video glorifying their school's wanton and nihilistic destruction. <br /> <br />Thankfully, they took their own sorry lives immediately thereafter. Imagine what cinematic epics Klebold and Harris might have scripted from their prison cells. Their insane musings wouldn't have looked much different from this nauseating waste of celluloid.

B000J10ERO|4.0|After a nearly two-decades-long absence, the Man of Steel returns to the big screen in this superb fifth installment in the Superman series. But this belated movie is actually more of a sequel to the first two Superman films, the second released a quarter century ago in 1981. <br /> <br />Director Richard Donner, novelist Mario Puzo, and uncredited screenwriter Tom Manckiewicz (listed as \\"creative consultant\\" in credits) conceived the initial outing, Superman: The Movie (1978), as a legendary epic of almost Shakespearian dimensions, a saga pitting good versus evil. Unfortunately, their lofty vision was not shared by producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind. Uncomfortable with a serious treatment of the Superman story, they brought in the husband/wife screenwriting team David and Leslie Newman to make the script more \\"campy,\\" à la the 1960s \\"Batman\\" TV series. <br />  <br />As a result of creative differences, and the Salkinds' refusal to pay Marlon Brando's steep royalties, Donner was replaced with director Richard Lester on the next installment, Superman II, and much of Donner's original footage was left on the proverbial cutting room floor. Fortunately, cinematic history has been kind to Richard Donner. On November 28, Warner Home Video finally releases his authorized version of Superman II, not only restoring scenes with Brando back into the film, but also restoring Donner to his rightful place as director. <br />  <br />To understand the downward spiral of the Superman franchise, consider 1983's Superman III, written solely by the Newmans and directed by Lester. An appalling collection of poorly timed slapstick gags, it has earned the dubious distinction of being the only movie in which comedian Richard Pryor can't buy a laugh. Superman IV in 1987 was even more unwatchable, suffering from bargain-basement production values and a PC script that reduced Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's classic superhero to a \\"No Nukes,\\" Bleeding-Heart of Steel. <br />  <br />Now, yearsafter lesser filmmakers left the Man of Steel in rust, director Bryan Singer finally restores the untarnished, larger-than-life superhero to his pedestal. <br />  <br />Comparisons between Superman Returns and Superman: The Movie are inevitable, especially because Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris consciously planned this film to have the same look, feel, and sound of the original. The most obvious similarity is in casting relative newcomer Brandon Routh in the role of Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent. Routh bears an uncanny resemblance to the young Christopher Reeve; indeed, he looks as though he could be Reeve's younger brother. <br />  <br />Superman Returns builds upon the plot of the first Reeve movie, and part of the second. To explain Superman's absence from the screen during the past nineteen years, Singer brings him back to Earth after a five-year self-imposed exile, during which time he trekked among the stars searching for the remains of his home planet, Krypton. <br />  <br />The movie opens with an amazing special-effects sequence as Superman's spaceborne ship hurtles through the galaxies back to Earth, returning to his family farm outside Smallville, USA. Voiceover monologue from his father, Jor-El--taken from Marlon Brando's unused footage for Superman II--sets the tone for the drama that follows. \\"Because of their [Earthlings'] capacity for good, I send them you, my only son.\\" Using Christ-like visual imagery, Superman is cast as Earth's savior, rescuing the planet time and again from those who wield the capacity for evil. <br />  <br />After a brief reunion with earthly mother Martha Kent, played by Eva Marie Saint, Superman reclaims his alter ego, Clark Kent, and his job in Metropolis as reporter for the Daily Planet. Things haven't changed much at the paper, except that cell phones have replaced desk sets and typewriters have been retired in favor of personal computers. Otherwise, editor Perry White (Frank Langella) is just as gruff as ever. Shutterbug Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) is still the same earnest greenhorn, and the only reporter in the MSM, aside from Tucker Carlson, still sporting a tacky bow tie.  <br />  <br />But one important thing has changed. When Superman left on his intergalactic quest for his roots, former lover Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), the Planet's ace reporter, believed she'd been ditched. Feeling betrayed, Lois won a Pulitzer Prize for an article, \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\\" \\"The world doesn't need a savior,\\" she tells Clark, \\"and neither do I.\\" He is devastated to learn that, on the rebound, she has given her heart to Richard White (James Marsden), the boss's nephew. What's worse, Lois and Richard now have a son, Jason. <br />  <br />Meanwhile, having discovered Superman's secret hideaway, the Fortress of Solitude, arch-enemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) launches a diabolical scheme using crystals laced with Kryptonite--the radioactive remains of Superman's planet that render him powerless. Placed in the Atlantic Ocean, the crystals multiply, creating a huge, artificial island that displaces enough ocean water to threaten much of North America with flooding. It's an ecological disaster right out of Al Gore's most fanciful nightmares, one that will force millions to turn to Luthor if they want to stay dry. Cha-ching! <br />  <br />Brandon Routh more than fills Chris Reeve's boots, and also those of George Reeves, the square-jawed actor who portrayed Superman in serial movies and on television during the 1950s. Like Reeve, Routh convincingly projects the superheroic qualities of Herculean strength and speed, as well as honor, chivalry, and courage. However, this loner-hero is cast in a more human, vulnerable light, though without ever mocking his dignity and heroic stature. This is a nobler Superman: all the annoying touches that in previous movies were meant to undermine the character are absent here. <br />  <br />Every superhero needs a supervillain in order to bring out his best virtues, and the movie delivers by casting Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. Although Gene Hackman is a great actor, he underplayed in the Luthor role a generation ago, almost to the point of nonchalance. Part of his failure to portray a true supervillain was due to his goofy wardrobe and even goofier sidekick (Ned Beatty). The sheer silliness undercut his credibility as a viable threat to Superman. <br />  <br />By contrast, Spacey's Luthor is a plausible adversary for the Man of Steel. \\"Gods are selfish beings who fly around in little red capes and don't share their powers with anyone else,\\" Luthor snarls. Spacey's characterization conveys that, for little men with big ambitions, envy of the good can be the most corrupting motive. When I first saw Spacey in American Beauty (1999), his smarminess as anti-hero Lester Burnham really rubbed me the wrong way. But after seeing him as Jack Lemmon's duplicitous boss in Glengarry Glen Ross and as the deliciously sociopathic Luthor here, I find him uniquely suited to playing cads and villains--not unlike George Sanders (Rebecca, All About Eve) a couple generations ago. <br />  <br />Kate Bosworth is somewhat less successful as Lois Lane. Undoubtedly a better actress than the previous Lois (Margot Kidder), Bosworth's waifish looks and spiral curls aren't what come to mind when you think of the spunky journalist from the DC comic books. A stronger, more alluring actress, such as Hilary Swank, would have been perfect to play the female lead in Superman's life. <br />  <br />All in all, however, Superman Returns is a widescreen extravaganza with something for everyone. <br />  <br />For the guys, it has street cred as an action flick, with its shoot-'em-up pyrotechnics and computer-generated images. These are truly spectacular, because they don't look so much like special effects as like natural camerawork. In fact, this film comes off as even more realistic than another visually impressive superhero flick,Spiderman II. <br />  <br />For the women in the audience, the movie offers a heart-rending story of unrequited love, though hinting at the possible reconciliation of the (literally) star-crossed lovers in the next film in the franchise, planned for release in 2009. <br />  <br />For fans of John Williams's soaring score in the 1978 film, there is composer John Ottman's skillful weaving of Williams's brassy fanfare into the new soundtrack, and conductor Damon Intrabartolo's lush interpretation. <br />  <br />For older movie buffs, Superman Returns also boasts the first reunion (in dialogue, thanks to the sound editors) of the late Marlon Brando and actress Eva Marie Saint since they appeared as working-class lovers in Elia Kazan's 1954 classic, On the Waterfront. <br />  <br />And for the kids, the picture provides not just grand entertainment but also some wonderful lessons. Its themes of gallantry, honor, and bravery will cause even many adults to revert to the child's uncorrupted and innocent point of view. In fact, when we saw this movie at an advance critics' screening--in midtown Manhattan, no less--that was exactly how that normally blasé audience reacted. <br />  <br />If a bunch of aging, cynical critics can \\"Wow!\\" aloud at the implausible actions of their childhood hero, boo and jeer at the soulless villain, and rise to a raucous standing ovation at the end, then Superman Returns may just be the savior that Hollywood has needed during all the years that he's been gone.
B000FAGGWQ|4.0|Back in 2004, this disc was included as the only \\"bonus\\" extra in the Original Trilogy's first DVD release.  <br /> <br />Sadly, that release was not only a tampered with set (modified even more than the 1997 Special Editions), but it was poorly restored, featuring odd colors and sound gaffes on the English and Spanish tracks of A New Hope. The 2004 box set was also packaged in a rather flimsy cardboard case that was easily damaged, leaving piles of dented and wrinkled cases on store shelves. <br /> <br />Despite these flaws, the highlight of the set for most was the \\"Bonus Materials\\" disc, which became a sought after item after it was nixed for inclusion in subsequent sets (the 2005 \\"Limited Edition\\" rehash and the 2006 2 disc sets). <br /> <br />For folks who wisely waited, now you can avoid any of the awful box sets and buy this disc seperately. <br /> <br />To long-time fans, this set contains some things of interest including the longer version of the \\"Empire of Dreams\\" documentary, which, despite including many \\"revisionist\\" statements by Lucas and his crew, is quite informative. It spends most of its time on the events leading up to the success of the first movie, and speeds quickly through the rest of the trilogy and the phenomenon that would become the Star Wars franchise to the present day. The other docos are interesting as well. <br /> <br />The disc features extensive picture galleries and nearly every trailer of the three original films ever released (though the quality varies widely). <br />It's great to see these unaltered. <br /> <br />The menus are pretty and show us some effects inconsistent with the 2004 versions, indicating that more care was taken with this release or else a very different team handled it than handled the \\"restoration\\" of the special editions mark II. <br /> <br />The rest of the material is rather dated now, and may be of lesser interest to Original Trilogy fans: <br /> <br />An Xbox only demo of \\"Star Wars Battlefront\\" a mediocre \\"Battlefield 1942\\" imitator. If you've already played the game on some other format, this version actually features some things that were cut from the final version of the game on Xbox and PC: the Bothan Spy and the Imperial Officer class (these two were modified and added in the sequel, SWBF2). This is a one level demo, the Battle of Endor, one of the better scenarios out of the video game. <br /> <br />There's also a trailer for the aforementioned game. Needless to say this game fell far short of my expectations. <br /> <br />There's a promotional teaser for Episode III, full of gushing and showing us the creation of the \\"new and improved\\" Vader helmet and Hayden Christiansen trying it on. I once avoided seeing this for fear of spoilers, but it turned out to just be mostly green/blue screen stuff and fluff. <br /> <br />There's a promotional video for the \\"Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\\" Xbox game, showing early gameplay and more fluff. I never played this game but apparently it was largely overhyped, and while decent by console standards of the day, hasn't held up well over time, much like the \\"Enter the Matrix\\" game. <br /> <br />And finally there's a hidden \\"blooper reel\\" done in the same style as the hidden blooper reels for the Prequel dvd's. Not hilarious by any stretch, but as entertaining as blooper reels tend to be. It's nice to see more vintage Star Wars footage, at any rate. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this, and give it 4 stars rather than 5 only because so much space is wasted on extras that nobody cares about now, which could have been better served with more vintage Original Trilogy material, like say, deleted scenes or vintage interviews (say with the late Peter Cushing or Sir Alec Guinness).

B000O178BY|5.0|Since their debut album in the late 80s with Pretty Hate Machine, Reznor and the Nine Inch Nails have put together quality music and made industrial rock famous.  They were a major part of the 90s rock scene with releases like Downward Spiral and The Fragile.  With Teeth was met with mixed reactions due to a mainstream-sounding sound, but on the new album Year Zero, Reznor brings in a new percussion-driven concept album that changes the way industrial and rock will be seen. <br /> <br />Most interesting is the little concept that has been going along with this album.  Marketing for this album has been quite unique, with tracks and videos being purposely leaked on USB drives during concerts.  Fake websites have been set up based around the story of Year Zero...a dark dystopian world set many years later (a \\"The Wall\\"-styled movie is rumored).  This is a \\"reality game\\" that will last for another year. <br /> <br />Now on to the album...it's better if I tell you how I felt with each song after 2-3 listen throughs. <br /> <br />1. Hyperpower! - Very nice instrumental that sets the tone for the album, very percussion based with a hiphoppish styled rhythm as the song progressively gets louder near the end, 9.8/10 <br />2. The Beginning Of The End - This kind of feels like With Teeth...lacks the energy of the rest of this album, 6/10 <br />3. Survivalism - Ah yes, the first single to the album.  It probably was overplayed on the radio station...interesting beats and a nice industrial instrumental near the end as the percussion dies out.  8.5/10...also recommened you check out the video. <br />4. The Good Soldier -  another nice pieces, but is nothing compared to what's ahead, 8.5/10   <br />5. Vessel - GOING FASTER!  This is the real stuff...I love the chorus to this part, should really be a single release, 10/10 <br />6. Me, I'm Not - this song is really hard to describe, has another hip-hop styled beat along with noises...makes good driving music as well, 9/10 <br />7. Capital G - This is the second single off the album and is already getting airplay on radio stations.  This seems to have a feel of a classic 80s song in a triple meter.  A new sound that definitely blows todays stuff.  Another good song on the album, 9.6/10.  Should also mention that this song isn't an anti-Bush song.  It's dealing with the \\"leader\\" of the dystopian world Reznor imagines. <br />8. My Violent Heart - One of the original leaked tracks...Trent Reznor appears to be speaking softly on the verses before the chorus takes in full gear.  8.8/10 <br />9. The Warning - \\"Time is ticking away\\", More of the electronic-sounding percussion along with simple riffs to create a interesting sound.  More of Reznor's talented songwriting is displayed here as well, 9.6/10 <br />10. God Given - Kind of feels like Justin Timberlake's Sexy Back on acid...which is actually quite good and catchy...would make a good radio single IMO, 9.9/10 <br />11. Meet Your Master - another solid piece of work by Reznor both musically and lyrically, another song that you can rock out too, especially during the chorus, 9.7/10 <br />12. The Greater Good - Compared to the past tracks, this track's got a soft atmospheric instrumental, kind of...creepy, will probably make a good movie scene in Reznor's rumored movie, 9.3/10 <br />13. The Great Destroyer - This is by far my favorite track on the album.  This track feels like a remix of random noise and the electronic drumming heard on the album as well as a simple guitar riff...and then after the second verse, once Reznor and the chorus yells \\"GREAT DESTROYEEEEEER!\\"  BOOM, in comes a kickass insturmental consisting of random noises and drumming (yes, it's damn loud), 12/10 <br />14. Another Version Of The Truth - another instrumental, but much softer, and in facts appears to be \\"cut off\\" at one point as it progressive gets louder.  To me, it felt like a weaker track...7/10 <br />15. In This Twilight - the percussion instrumental feels familiar, yet sounds different.  Anyways, this is another solid track by Reznor...also makes good radio material too, 9.3/10 <br />16. Zero-Sum - probably the best closer yet for NIN.  This can be like a progressive song with some of the best lyrics I have heard in a while during the chorus. 9.7/10 <br /> <br />The band has changed over the years, from their anger-driven Broken to their conceptual/percussion-driven Year Zero.  Yet you can still feel the same industrial vibe that has always been in Reznor's work.  This band has change slowly over the years yet Reznor has never let me down with any of his work.  I have been a fan since I heard his Closer song on the radio and bought The Downward Spiral.  It will be interesting though to see what Reznor does in the upcoming years.  To people who says that today's music sucks...think again.  As long as Reznor and the Nine Inch Nails are here, music will still thrive. <br /> <br /> <br />Also, you probably may have known by now with the album, the disc changes colors from brown to white with binary numbers when played.  A nice trick by Reznor.

There is almost always something you miss that, when found or realized, makes the movie even more touching and awesome and you are able to appreciate even more the hard work that was put into it.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|I, for one, actually DO miss the old Rush. The halcyon days of dreamy, ethereal visions, by three of the finest musicians on the planet. For me, after Moving Pictures, they literally caved in as a serious force. Three minute repetitive ditties just do not do it for me. Where once they rebelled with stylish imagination, they seemed to remove their hearts and minds, until three zombies continued to dirge and drivel, like poisonous pensioners. I even got to the point of hating their sound. I would buy the albums as they were released in the hope that there was a chink of light. Occasionally there would be a track that gripped me, but my candle for them finally went out some years ago. So it is startling to even me that, when I spotted S&A during a shop visit, I decided \\"yeah go on, let's see what they're about now\\". I was very pleasantly surprised. There IS a 70s feel that surfaces throughout the album. By this I mean I can hear \\"The Trees\\", \\"Hemispheres\\" et al sporadically surfacing amongst the  pieces, intermingled with their latter day style. Lifeson's guitar style is simply sublime and yes, I can hear \\"Permanent Waves\\" in his riffing. Geddy's voice is as perfect as ever, albeit a little bit safer than in his youth. Peart's percussions is, well, simply the finest Mother Earth ever spawned. I listened to the critiques and actually found them so far off from my own viewpoint. \\"Spindrift\\" is an utterly fantastic track that would have sat perfectly on the Moving Pictures album. Moody, atmospheric and daunting. \\"Armor and Sword\\", after a couple of plays, just possesses a sound that gets under my skin and forces the hairs to stand out. \\"Bravest Face\\" is so anthemic and should be played in every school in the land. It is a cry for help, against the downward spiral in humanity today. Alas, however, this review is not all good news. As with nearly every Rush album there are maddeningly irrelevant tracks of little worth and this album continues that trend. However, I have tosay I have not felt quite so turned on by a Rush album for a very long time and I cannot wait for the next tour. My one and only question to Rush will now be, when do we get the next \\"Spirit Of Radio\\"? Where's the next blockbuster?
B000OCXMAE|2.0|For a huge fan of LP I was beyond excited for their newest album. And after listening to it a few times im very dissapointed. I understand some of the reviews where people have said that they are expanding into new areas. I dont disagree that this is a wise move on their part, HOWEVER lets face facts if you want to broaden your horizons you do some of what you know and some of the new to feel out your fans. Using your reputation to make us jump onto a CD with \\"NEW\\" material is not only career suicide but dissrepectful to their fans. I agree with the Reviewer that stated the Rap part was almost completely Nill in the record. <br /> <br />I also cant seem to figure out what it is that causes rock bands like LP or Korn for example to go from the HARDER feelings in their music to a complete 180 and now whine, moan, complain and grovel in their new stuff...someday maybe the music industry will let us in on their secret. <br /> <br />I'll admit I wont stop listening to it or to them, but please be warned if your looking for anything like their old material this is not the CD you think it is.
0743454537|4.0|I enjoyed reading the novel, \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" by Jodi Picoult.  The book was very engaging and the author did a nice job of developing all of the characters.  The only dislike about the book was that the point of view jumped around a lot between different characters & even different time periods, which made it slightly difficult to follow at times (although it was interesting to listen to the various characters points of view as well).  Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to others.

(both bites are note for note)  where is the variety of vocal range on this record? why does mustaine talk through a lot of this album? why are the riffs so boring and familiar and the solos too long? and where are some REAL members of megadeth? no good choruses or hooks, no interesting riffs and a pointless contrived remake of toute le moblahhh make this a pathetic album from an old rocker who should hang it up and retire until ellefson, friedman, and menza step back in.
0553382179|5.0|I have been  a member of FlyLady since early 2000.  When I first found her, my home was a dump and I was severely depressed.  I used Flylady to change my life.  So, when this book first came out, I thought: Why Should I Buy This Book?  I Don't Need It! After all, my control journal was made, blah blah blah.  However, I found that this book  is a compilation of the best of FlyLady -- a wonderful, portable version of FlyLady's system!  Because it is a book, I don't need to be glued to the computer to benefit from Flylady -  I can use my copy of the book to fill those lost moments in the day usually spent waiting for something or someone.  Reading it keeps Marla's encouragements forefront in my mind, \\"You are not behind!\\"  \\"You can do anything for 15 minutes\\"  \\"Housework done incorrectly still blesses my home\\".  Regarding format, one of the things that I like about this book is that testimonials are in boxes, which means that I can skip the ones that I am tired of or that don't interest me, allowing me to focus on the meat of the book, which is considerable.  My copy is now so dog-eared that I really need to get a new one!  The greatest thing about the book form is that you do not need internet access to benefit from the life strategies taught by Marla Cilley (FlyLady). The focus of this book is feeling good about your home and life, taking care of yourself and doing it all without stress or guilt. I highly recommend this book!
0897500482|5.0|This book is not just Bruce Lee's take on the martial arts, but also how he integrated the martial arts with philosophy and life lessons that he learned throughout his brief life. This book is my bible. I read a page or two every chance I can get to give me a different perspective on how to approach my everyday situations. This is a classic and a must for the modern martial artist. This book will help you with any martial art or sport you may be training in, and it will give you the inner strength, the mental strength, to help you achieve success in the arts, your sport, and in life. Enjoy it. I have for 20 years and still learning. Thanks, Bruce.

B00005JPKE|4.0|A complimentary film to \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\", \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" uses many of the same techniques (including flashbacks during sequences where the soldiers are reading letters from loved ones or where they are thinking of events that occurred prior to their being stationed on the sparsely populated resource poor island) as that film but manages to touch on the personal much better than \\"Flags\\". Perhaps its Eastwood's perspective as an outsider to Japanese culture that made him more attuned as a director to these characters in \\"Letters\\" either way this film manages to get under the skins of the various characters much more successfully than \\"Flags\\" did. Although not as complex in terms of technique, \\"Letters\\" is every bit as complex emotionally as its companion piece. Perhaps the less complex storytelling structure allows Eastwood to dig a big deeper under the surface of these characters either way the two films when seen together are much richer than either one alone.<br /><br />Focusing much of its time on Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) a young reluctant recruit and the Japanese Commander Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) who must try and hold Iwo Jima with limited resources and no support from Japan, the film tells their desperate attempt to hold the island despite their bleak chances of success at fighting the massive American contingent arriving by sea and air. Eastwood manages to convey the fear, doubt and bravery of these soldiers as they tunnel into the mountainside of Iwo Jima taking an unconventional defense tactic which given the massive forces they face is the only chance that they have for success. Holding out for almost six weeks against superior fire and man power, Kuribayashi and his troops beat the odds putting up a heroic fight against a technological and resource superior adversary. Eastwood doesn't sugar coat the battle or the difficulties that both sides face in either film and doesn't glorify the cost of war. World War II may have been the last noble war that the United States was involved in but that doesn't make the cost of war noble or acceptable. There are always heroes on both sides of the battle regardless of whose ideology was right and on the field of battle there isn't right or wrong--just a desperate attempt to fight for your own survival amid the larger concerns that exist outside a small island in the South Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />Like \\"Flags\\", \\"Letters\\" looks extremely good in its transfer to DVD. The muted color scheme and look of the film add to the vividness as well as sense of reality that is essential to recreate the world from 60 plus years ago. Audio brilliantly conveys the ambiance of the island and the heat of battle with well placed sound effects. A warning for those expecting another war film in English--this is presented (with the exception of a few scenes) in Japanese since that's what the soldiers spoke. The film is subtitled in English with Spanish and French subtitles available as well.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Flags\\", \\"Letters\\" appears as a \\"special edition\\" from the get-go. While we don't get a commentary track (Eastwood has shied away from doing a commentary track for years and its probably just as well since he's a man of few but well chosen words), we get a number of terrific extras on the second disc. \\"Red Sun, Black Sand: The Making of `Letters from Iwo Jima'\\" is a terrific documentary on the making of the film allowing Eastwood and his team to discuss what drove them to create this companion piece and the complex challenges of filming two very similar films from different perspectives back-to-back.<br /><br />\\"The Faces of War\\" presents the cast introducing and discussing the characters they play in the film. For me it was the second most interesting extra here since even though familiar with military history often do not see the individual faces of the \\"enemy\\". Since history is often written by the victory of any battle, these individuals who fought for their countrywith as much passion as the Allies did for theirs are often overlooked and forgotten.<br /><br />Perhaps Eastwood's two epics would have fared better at the Oscars if they had been presented theatrical as one epic film since the two require each other as counterpoints. Either way, the two together have much more impact than either alone although of the two I found \\"Letters\\" to be the more compelling piece simply because we saw a side we rarely see if films about World War II focusing on the enemy. Watching the two films back-to-back was an exhausting experience but ultimately more rewarding for me since they dovetail quite nicely in their examination of the personal cost of war on the people who actually fight it and don't glorify the horrors of war. Eastwood continues to show amazing growth and talent as a film director proving that director's careers don't necessarily have to burn brightly and fade away as many of our top talents have.<br /><br />I'd suggest the deluxe set which has an extra disc with a History Channel documentary and short from WWII.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000P1XITE Letters from Iwo Jima / Flags of Our Fathers (Five-Disc Commemorative Edition)]]r country with as much passion as the Allies did for theirs are often overlooked and forgotten.  <br /> <br />Perhaps Eastwood's two epics would have fared better at the Oscars if they had been presented theatrical as one epic film since the two require each other as counterpoints.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|This album is incredible to say the least. There are no words to describe my reaction to this revised remixed body of work, but I'll give it a shot anyway.<br /><br />Not only is the content beyond anything you may have already purchased or heard, specific to any pre-released Beatles compilation, but the \\"SUPER-QUALITY\\" of George Martin's immeasurable remastering of the original recordings, as well as his unique and imaginative \\"reorganization\\" of the arrangements and tracks, is of historical proportions. The quality \\"remastered\\" sound of these older tracks is amazing. No kidding.<br /><br />I find it incredible that the effort put into this musical production which was from the begining, ear-marked for the Cirque du' Soleil show \\"Beatles Love\\",  currently running in Las Vegas, has become somewhat of legendary piece of music, in and of itself. From begining to end this production takes you on a \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" of sorts of all the Beatles musical contributions. All wrapped up in a tidy and concise feast for your ears. Shouldn't really surprise any of us, in light of the source material coming from one of the greatest rock bands in history.<br /><br />For Beatle fans throughout the world, as well as casual admirers of the Fab Four's musical contributions, this album recolors what it was like to be around back then, as the music was being created. The big difference is in how impressive the sound quality is. Your experinces in life, love and music will all come back to you like never before.<br /><br />The DVD version (I own both versions), is beyond anything you've ever heard as well, in that George Martin utilizes true 5-channel encoding adding an element of fun to the listening experience. I do prefer the CD version over the DVD version for accurate listening however, as it best recreates what the music sounded like back in the day.<br /><br />Simply stated; Superb. A must have. Especially while listening in the car.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00005JPKE|5.0|This was an excellent movie and a credit to Eastwood. The Flag of our Fathers book falsely portrayed the Marines as good little boy scouts. Here they are shown shooting prisoners out of hand and looting corpses. Not a bad reality check even if it is balanced by naughty Japanese scenes.<br /><br />There are some good touches like the General and his men listening on the wireless to little Japanese schoolgirls singing their praises even as they face the end. Contrary to an earlier review, I thought the captured marine scene was good.  Although the US mom's letter was a take off from Apocalypse Bow and the German general in Band of Brothers, the Japanese guy asking if he knew Douglas Fairbanks and producing the photo of his horse was a classic. The Japanese scenes of hopeless women and children and stupid secret policemen (shooting a dog for God's sake) were also good. Movies are not documentaries and if little vignettes resonate with us, the movie achieves what a documentary cannot,<br /><br />Far from being a reaction to bushido, I feel the Japanese have a thirst to learn about their history. History is not taught in schools and the TV only shows samurai movies, which are like spaghetti westerns on a bad day. More generally, it is good to see a non English speaking movie and such great actors. It speaks volumes for Eastwood that he could make such a masterpiece.
B000O174CM|4.0|After all the hype, the meteoric rise of Jennifer Hudson, the media-contrived \\"cat fights\\" between Jennifer and her co-star, Beyonce Knowles, and the ultimately disappointing result of Eddie Murphy's Oscar nomination, this film stands on its own merits.  There are strong acting and vocal performances all around, particularly those of the amazing Ms. Hudson.  <br /> <br />The story is loosely based on the backstage saga of The Supremes, but never really makes one-on-one personal comparisons. Rather, the writers of the original stageplay, staged in the 1980's, used the real-life story as a launching point to tell a new tale. The screenplay enhances the story with stunning visuals and viable new tunes, including \\"I Love You, I Do,\\" and \\"Listen,\\" which were both nominated for Best Song. <br /> <br />The DVD has plenty of engaging extras, including cast interviews, and rehearsal/production coverage that enrich the home viewing experience.  On a side note, the talents of Anika Noni Rose have been grossly overlooked, not only in the promotion of the film, but as evidenced by her impressive audition, available among the DVD's extra features.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Someone who reads all my reviews might get the opinion that I only love or hate things.  The truth of the matter is that I only review things I care one way or another about, and this series is one of those things. <br /> <br />Firefly was quirky, I must say.  It's set in a fusion of Chinese and Western cultures that should be awkward...and there are times it manages to be.  When I first started watching it, I figured I'd pretty much dislike it.  2 episodes into the series, and I LOVED IT. <br /> <br />This series tackles the complexity of relationships like very few other series out there. The morals of living outside the law have rarely been given the treatment they were given in this series.  I couldn't BELIEVE how much I enjoyed many of the characters in this series.  Watch it, and you'll find the same thing. <br /> <br />This really is a great series.  It's one of the best I've ever seen, and it reveals how completely inept the Fox network is at making decisions on what shows to keep and what shows to cancel.  I mean, look at the Amazon rankings.  It's still #79 on their rankings, and it's been out for 4-5 years now! <br /> <br />If you're considering buying this series, do it.  You'll not regret watching it.  Maybe someday the SciFi network will pick it up, and it'll really be able to stretch its legs.  Maybe...Buy it, and let your money speak for good television.
B00001QEE9|5.0|I love Pinocchio when he lies. His nose grew and grew longer and sure gives me an idea how creative author has. It's original powerful animation that Walt Disney has to present. Also I must add when Pinocchio asking the creator Why, Why, and Why and suddenly I asked my parents why Pinocchio asking Why's. A perfect family animation film.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|A must-have if you own a Blu-ray player.  About 70% of it is really great stuff.  The first disk is one of the most impressive.  Some of the other disks use a lot more general film stock, cropped heavily to show close-ups of animals, but it's still very good.  You can tell when the footage is cropped stuff.  The best footage in it is the stuff shot on HD Video, by far.<br /><br />Be sure to get the one that has David's voice, and not Sigourney Weaver.  Even though I'm American, I still like his voice much more for this type of thing.
B00004W19V|5.0|I love the movie when I watched that with closed-captioning on HBO 10+ years ago. Unfortunately, this DVD doesn't contains Closed-Captioning.

Amazon did put down Closed-Captioning and I bought it, and found it doesn't contains with Closed-Captioning. Of course, I was disappointed and knowing I couldn't do much. (Short Circuit 2 has Closed-Captioning and English Subtitle with Tri-Star Columbia Company.). Hope Fox company will release this title and add this very important feature a Closed-Captioning.
B000MUV58Y|4.0|OK, I admit it, sometimes Grey's Anatomy can be a little chick-flickish, i.e. the end of the second season. Nonetheless; Grey's Anatomy is like visual crack. From the music to the stories, Grey's offers the viewer a first class ride inside the trials and tribulations of the flawed medical staff at Seattle Grace Hospital. One caveat, well, maybe two! I hope they tone the emotional Issie character down a notch and bring the duties and responsibilities of the nurses' a bit more into focus. Although I've never been involved in the medical field, I can remember my mother coming home utterly exhausted after having worked a double shift, which is an all too common experience for both doctors and nurses. Beside these minor adjustments, Grey's Anatomy is great!

0743496728|4.0|the only thing I found extremely unrealistic was the fact that Alex did not recuse herself from the case much sooner.  In fact it is unrealistic that she even started on it in the first place.

B000O1799U|4.0|I was very entertained by the movie, and loved the music, the production, and the acting--especially the Oscar nominated supporting actor performance of Eddie Murphy, and most of all the Oscar winning supporting actress nomination for Jennifer Hudson. What a dream for her to go from losing on American Idol to winning an Oscar! The film was dazzling--like a dream--but when I woke up, I had some qualms and questions about it.<br /><br />When you create a fictional narrative, you must create a universe to contain that story. You have awesome power, but also you have awesome responsibility. The risk is that you will create a straw man argument, or engage in historical revisionism. Fiction has been defined as a way of lying to tell the truth, but here I thought that there was too much baggage, too much hidden agenda, and I lost faith in it.<br /><br />Jennifer Hudson was really great and deserved her Oscar, though a friend said she wasn't acting so much as singing. She sang supremely, though. The movie was kind of skewed to be more about her, a lead singer forced to become a background singer, and then fired just as the group was poised for enormous success. Everything was viewed through that distorted prism, and the success of the group with Deena Jones (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles) at the helm was discounted, as if the group had sold out, had gone commercial. It seemed strange that in a musical where they sang about everything from brushing their teeth to riding the bus, after Hudson is jettisoned, their string of hits is not even heard, but just seen in montage as a series of sheet music covers, and an announcer voice-over describing their amazing success. There is absolutely nothing about the life or feelings of Deena Jones, a thinly veiled Diana Ross, and finally the group is shown retiring, and calling back Effie (Hudson) for their farewell performance swan song. Beyonc&eacute; really doesn't get a chance to act, just really looks great. The movie is framed to suggest that she doesn't really have musical talent, but is just a pretty face. At one point their manager, Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx) even says that he chose her to front the group because she was so bland that anyone could project their own feelings onto her. Effie sang more like Aretha Franklin, but I don't recall that she began her career as a back up singer for The Supremes.<br /><br />I also had problems with the character played by Eddie Murphy, James \\"Thunder\\" Early. Though I enjoyed his performance immensely, his character was given short shrift, because it was all about Effie. He was supposed to be an amalgamation of James Brown, Little Richard, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, and Wilson Pickett, which took him in too many directions, being all things to all people. The story, being all about Effie, dictated that he was on the way down. A Star is Born, while another star falls. I enjoyed one scene a lot when he suddenly stopped singing the ballad he was supposed to do, and went into a very funky James Brown style number, dropping his pants on the coda. But, I don't think that ever actually happened. In spite of my problems with the story, Eddie Murphy did some great acting, and also showed that he has a very musical side as well.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is another actor who is also very musical. His character, Curtis Taylor Jr., is a thinly veiled Berry Gordy Jr., but he was not served well by the story, either. He doesn't get much chance to show his musical side, and is shown as being more of a car salesman who only enters the music business to make money. Without him, they probably wouldn't have achieved their phenomenal success, but once they have it made, the script and the other characters turn against him.<br /><br />The film started out with regular dialogue, and music performed where appropriate, such as on stage at a talent show. But then midway, the characters start singing instead of talking. It is kind of jarring. If you would like to see an entire filmwith singing instead of dialogue, I recommend seeing The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, a French film from 1964. The music is by Michel Legrand, and one of the songs, \\"Watch What Happens,\\" is now considered a jazz standard. \\"I Will Wait For You\\" was a recurring theme, and is a very haunting and romantic theme, indeed. It is a very romantic movie, starring a 20 year-old Catherine Deneuve. Ooh la la.<br /><br />Another film I can endorse, if you want to know the REAL story of Motown, is Standing in the Shadows of Motown. Instead of focusing on a back up singer from an ersatz Supremes, it tells the story of The Funk Brothers, who were the back up group recording for all the Motown roster. James Jamerson, the bass player, never got song writing credit, but what a contribution he made to the Motown Sound. Here we learn that while on the road, he annoyed the other Funk Brothers by smoking cigars and eating pickled pig's feet. None of the musicians got writing credit, but they played on more hit songs than The Beatles. There were three guitars in the rhythm section, and one of the guitarists was White. I mention that because he is interviewed about how he got along with everyone, and he says he never had any problems with the other musicians, but during a race riot in Detroit, he was trapped in the studio. There is a scene like that in Dreamgirls, but Effie is pretty oblivious to the riot, it is only a backdrop to her own drama.m with singing instead of dialogue, I recommend seeing The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, a French film from 1964.

B00005JPLW|5.0|Frank Miller adaptations are on a roll. First we got \\"Sin City,\\" and now we have the story of three hundred Spartans who repelled a massive invasion.<br /><br />And the adaptation of \\"300\\" is a stunning one -- literally stunning, since it bombards the viewer with larger-than-life characters, smashing visuals and tight direction. It goes a bit too fast for its own good, but it's a truly epic film that takes the historical war movie to another level -- all the more so because it actually happened.<br /><br />As the introduction tells us, the Spartans were the ultimate warrior people. Babies were inspected for weakness or faults, and killed if they had any; as they were growing up, they were taught and toughened by a savage regimen. Their only true hope was to \\"die beautifully\\" for their land.<br /><br />A Persian messenger arrives, telling King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) that the god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) wants the Spartans to bow to him. Leonidas' response: shove the Persians into a pit. But before he can go to war, he must consult the corrupt priesthood of Ephors and their beautiful Oracle. She predicts that Sparta will fall and the gods forbid war at the approach of the Carneaian festival -- courtesy of a hefty bribe from a Spartan traitor.<br /><br />So Leonidas takes out three hundred of his best men, along with their nervy Arcadian allies, and begin trouncing the Persians. But they are being sabotaged, both by a hunchbacked outcast and by a treacherous councilor, whom Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is battling. And so at Thermopylae, Leonidas prepares for a final battle against the monstrous Persian Army -- knowing that their story of freedom will live on.<br /><br />This is not a \\"sensitive\\" movie where you have any appreciation for the bad guys -- it's a glorification of three hundred soldiers who died for their land and freedom. It just wouldn't work otherwise. It doesn't blindly adore the Spartans -- we see their darker side in their \\"weed out the weak\\" policy -- but it does appreciate them. They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.<br /><br />And it's done in a manner appropriate to its comic book origins -- grimy, bloody and epic, but with a stylized look that is almost like CGI. The battles are shockingly good, and full of fantasy-ish creations like the monstrous creatures or the silver-masked Immortals. Even a wall of corpses. But we also get some beautiful visuals as well -- roiling seas, sunlit battlefields, Spartan cities, and the drugged Oracle in her white veil.<br /><br />While the script gets a bit over-the-top at times, it's hard not to be moved by dialogue that can be darkly funny (\\"It's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare\\") or stirring (\\"He did not wish tribute, nor song, or monuments or poems of war and valor. His wish was simple: \\"Remember us.\\" That was his hope, should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be\\").<br /><br />Butler and Headey are simply great as Leonidas and Gorgo -- they're both strong, passionate and fearless, and they both do a great job in their separate storylines. But the movie is filled with good performances -- David Wenham as the narrator, Dominic West as a disgusting traitor, Santoro as the decadent, arrogant god-king, and many others.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is a unique, stirring, stunning movie that pushes the action-movie envelope, and gives a thrilling edge to a real-life story of overwhelming edge.

0060736267|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was honestly one of the best books I have ever read. I was actually a little shocked at how deeply I loved it and how much I didn't want to put it down. A lot of times books written many years ago have a style to them that makes them a little less enjoyable to read. This didn't have that at all and I actually thought it was a new book just written about the early 1900s time period. The story really flowed nicely.<br /><br />One of the things I think that makes a book great is it's ability to change your perspective. This book really did that for me. In the way I think about money and education. I have a passion now to really succeed through college and get the career I have always wanted and I attribute a lot of that new drive to reading this book.<br /><br />In short, this book is an excellent choice when looking for a good read. It is now one of my favorite books of all time.

1400079179|3.0|Looking for an enticing thriller?  Well, after finally finishing the 489 pages of The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, I must say that the novel was somewhat disappointing.  Brown's controversial novel, which exploits the differing views on the Bible and Jesus Christ, is one that would make conspiracy addicts go crazy.  The story follows the desperate search of Robert Langdon and Sophie Noveau across Paris and London to find the Holy Grail.  It is lengthy, filled with questionable religious data, and overall a mediocre piece of work.  But for those looking for a stimulating read who don't mind sifting through some flaws, this one is worth giving a shot.<br /><br />The chase starts off well after the initial escape from the Louvre, and made me excited to discover where the mystery would take Robert and Sophie.  Then the glitches begin.  The constant switching of viewpoints is aggravating, as I found it annoying to finally settle into the lunatic albino character and then have to switch back to boring Langdon.  Yet Brown is successful in putting the reader constantly on edge as he tantalizes you with a revelation that can only be figured out after sifting through the next couple chapters.  His writing style either lures you in even closer or, in my case, causes frustration and ruins any interest.<br /><br />Then there is the controversial side of the book: the role of Mary Magdalene in the life of Jesus and the corruption of the Church.  Each page bombards the reader with questionable historical and religious information.  Not to mention repetitive and tiresome.  If you are looking for a conspiracy, then this is a book to pick up.  At first, I was tempted to believe everything the novel told me, but eventually became fed up with how ridiculous and inaccurate some of Brown's claims seemed to be.  At the end of the novel, the search for the Holy Grail ends bluntly and makes one ask, \\"Was it really worth reading these 500 pages?\\"<br /><br />Brown's thriller was most likely not meant to be a piece of literary genius.  It can never be in the first place with its lack of characterization, which makes Robert and Sophie seem one-sided and dull.  Even the great mystery itself involved clues that I was able to figure out before the characters could, which made me loose interest and made the mystery not so \\"great\\" anymore.  Don't get me wrong; the novel does a good job of dragging you along the streets of Paris and leaving you hanging and yearning for an answer.  It is a simple thriller that does its job, but its lack of depth and intellectual craft makes it no Mona Lisa.ikely not meant to be a piece of literary genius.

B000NVIGC0|1.0|Maybe in time I shall grow to love this CD, it has happened with other Wilco CDs. But I am hesitant about this one, primarily because I don't see how I will start to like this more unless I buy a large amount of mood altering drugs. And mood altering drugs might have something to do with this album, it sounds like a Prozac album. The songs, for lack of a better word, are dull. Most follow the same formula, a somewhat slow moving pop song that goes into a three minute instrumental fade-out. It is Steely Dan on downers. Maybe I'm just tired of analyzing these songs until I \\"get them.\\" And you can rationalize all you want, but this album falls flat, which is why Tweedy is probably so much on the defensive when he discusses it. Heck, this CD makes \\"A Ghost is Born\\" seem epic. Bring Back Jay!

B000K15VSA|5.0|Please, Please, Please......Let this Definitive Cut version of Blade Runner include the original theater release with Harrison Ford's voice over. I had watched the Original Cut (1982) of the Film, I can't tell you how much times, during the 10 years before the release of the Director's Cut (1992). For me, all my friends and other Blade Runner Fans I have talked over the years, there is something missing......Deckard's wonderful narrative throughout the movie.......which we love so much! <br />The Director's Cut is probably great for people who have never watched the film before. However, it's time that loyal fans like myself are given a chance after 25 years, to be able to watch a FULL RE-MASTERED DVD version of the Original Blade Runner film. Then we will be waiting for the release of a Blu-Ray/HD version......ha, ha. <br />Whatever the controversy over the Original/Director's cut, it has nothing to do with Blade Runner Fans. So why are the Original Fans still waiting? <br />It is time for whoever, to realise just how let down we feel about their decision-making and to use the New Definitive Cut as a golden opportunity to make amends. <br />
B000000H6D|3.0|Am I the only one that has a different version to this album?  Blood and Fire is like track #12 on my album and it sounds radically different.  Oh well.<br /><br />Either way this is probably one of the best Type O albums to date and for good reason.  If you're a fan of this genre, then Bloody Kisses is for you.  All songs are continuous and moody as all hell and pretty catchy.  I never thought slow and low could sound so good, but it does.  Such a shame they haven't been able to get more recognition for their work.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Honestly now.  They had such a great system going, and yet they say that U2 is a big influence.  A band that won a grammy saying \\"yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\\" please.  Linkin Park needs to take a look in the mirror and rethink who it looks up to and go back to their old ways.  And yeah the cd is good for frisbee fodder after all.
0743298020|5.0|I have a new favorite book.  It is the Thirteenth Tale.  Upon finishing, I immediately went to find another book by Diane Setterfield, the author.  Imagine my disappointment and shock that this is her debut.  Setterfield has it all!  She can create a great plot.  In this case, it is a mystery about the life of a star author.  She creates great characters.  Almost all of them are crazy in some way, and yet endearing.  She makes you care about them.  And she is a master word smith.  Her language is beautiful and gothic.  Just start at the beginning, in the antiquarian book shop that her father owns, and you will see what I mean.  If the book affects you like it did me, you will swear you can even smell the dust on the books.

B000NQR7KM|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the best Genesis' albums and it marks the departure of Peter Gabriel and the ascension of Phil Collins as vocalist of the band, as well as it was the last album with Steve Hacket. Apart from the fact that I prefer Genesis with Peter Gabriel, I think this album is a \\"must have\\" for Genesis' fans. The songs are very good and well elaborated in the Genesis' old style. In what concerns this new release, I have to say that the sound for the multi-channel recordings - SACD or DVD-A - is an excitement for any music fan. The sound is very clear and even after listening to the old versions of this album for hundreds of times you can clearly notice many nuances and details that you had never noticed before. Besides that you have the extra material which alone is worth the money you pay for it. You will get 3 videos of songs from this album with multi-channel surround sound and also a video with some live material including \\"I know what I like\\" and \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" and having the old Yes drummer Bill Brufford playing with the band. It is true that the sound of this video is not very good (it is  PCM stereo) but it is worth having anyway. Go get it now.

B000002UC5|2.0|As a devote Beatle fan I've began to expand my collection into the solo works of the Beatles. This album was a complete disappointment. I've listened to this album intently for the fifth time hoping it would grow on me to no avail. Do yourself a favor and skip this album entirely, it comes across as an album of 'B' sides and outakes that are poor at best. If your looking to expand your Beatle horizons start with anything from George or John.

B0000CABBW|4.0|This movie is a moving portrail of a powerful tribal bloodline that has almost forgot the ways of their life that keep them strong and vibrant .  Prevokes thoughts of our own Amercian Indian tribes forced to live a different life on a reservation.  Acting is excellent, evoking intense emotion.  Music moves the viewer with constant beautiful passionate tones... Happy ending!!!!!  Thoughts of the movie last days after viewing it..
B000067FP7|4.0|Gremlins was part of a tradition of 80s horror movies that dealt with a campy action and some strange creature coming into people's otherwise ordinary lives and causing destruction.  Steven Speilburg in his early career seemed to favor mainstream comic movies that had a slightly silly premise mixed in with action and some horror aspects, but kept it light and airy enough to appeal to children as well as adults.  This was one of them, in keeping with his success from E.T. <br /> <br />Billy Peltzer is given an early Christmas gift from his father, who bought a curious creature called a mogwai from an ancient Chinese man's cherio shop.  He is named Gizmo, and aside from being adorable and so cute you want to squeeze him all the time, there are some special rules for handling him.  No bright lights, especially sunlight as it will kill him.  Never get him wet, and never feed him after midnight.  Naturally, these rules are going to be broken and disaster is going to strike. <br /> <br />When Billy accidentally gets him wet, five new mogwai are among them.  Their antics are crafier, fouler, and sneekier than anything Gizmo attempted, as he is sweeter and good natured while these are the mean ones that sabatoge machines like they are famous for.  Trouble is predicted ... And eventually they get Billy to feed them after midnight.  Could it be more cheesy that he's watching Attack of the Pod People From Mars when he nods off to sleep, then wakes up the next day to find that the five are in cocoons?  That night, they hatch, turn into horrible mosters, and wreck the town. <br /> <br />When they turn into the horrible green monsters, the movie takes another turn.  They become ridiculous as well as destructive, turning it from a horror story into a somewhat silly chain of events.  There is plenty of gross out as well, especially the Stripe's melting in the sunlight climax.  It was a good time, a silly horror fantasy movie.  And even after all these years, Gizmo is still so cuteI want to squeeze him. :)
0143038419|5.0|What initially captivated me was Gilbert's frankness. From her failures and mistakes to her embarrassing desires, she revealed so much about herself in this book that at times it made me wonder if she had a concept of privacy at all. But of course it wasn't just her frankness that was appealing.  The tidbits of information she picked up at her destinations (for example: the standard Italian language was decided by a council to be based on Dante's language; the word in Sanskrit for ancient spiritual seekers, antevasin, means \\"one who lives at the border\\"; Bali's settlers were all Hindu kings, aristocrats, and artists evading the muslim invasion of Java) were informative and enjoyable, and so were her interpretations, and frequently her jokes, around them. However it is really the sincerity in her quest -- the effort she put into delivering herself from her past -- that made her story so touching.
B000067FP8|2.0|How and why did this movie ever get made?  It was a ridiculous follow up to the destruction of Kingston Falls instead taking place in the Big Apple inside a skyscraper rather than a small town. <br /> <br />Billy Peltzer and his girlfriend have moved from their small town to New York, and are working at the same company within a skyscraper.  Somehow Gizmo has returned to them, having escaped the clutches of the mad scientist lab in the basement of their same workplace.  The story is exactly like the one before, except that the art direction team had a few more liberties and went further with the new cute mogwai, and even greater creativity with the monsterous gremlins.  The plot was more overtly campy than the first one, without the slightest hit of a horror movie and just a bunch of screwball comedy antics.  Gizmo is still cute, and I still want to squeeze him, but don't waste your time.
B00005JPFH|3.0|Spider-man 3 was clearly 2007's most hyped movie and not necessarily due to the marketing machine behind it.  In fact, the marketing budget for this film was considerably less than the 1st or 2nd installments and for good reason; it wasn't necessary.  The film already had it's fanbase established. <br /> <br />Spider-man 2 is a tough act to follow and while they managed a fine film for #3, it did not surpass it's predecessor.  <br /> <br />In this film, Spider-man is a star and the attention he receives bolsters the ego of a once un-popular teenager.  While strong in his principles, Peter is still emotionally immature and he must first forgive himself of the burden he continues to carry regarding Uncle Ben's death.  When we discover Uncle Ben's true killer, Peter's guilt is buried by feelings of revenge and Peter's behavior changes accordingly.  This behavior manifests physically as a black alien substance is drawn toward's Peter's unbottled aggression (without any backstory or explanation).  This substance is seductive and amplifies Peter's hunger for revenge and his bloated ego.   <br /> <br />There is a lot going on here and while it all works toward a great story with lots of potential depth, there just isn't enough time to fully develop all of the great ideas. <br /> <br />As in the previous films, the best scenes this time around DON'T have Spider-man in them.  This is, at it's core, a story about the life of Peter Parker and how his various responsibilities are in continuous conflict.  James Franco shines and Kirsten Dunst has much more to do this time around.  Tobey Maguire finds great balance in Peter's inherent nerdiness and lovability with his dark side and has great fun all the while! <br /> <br />While the birth of the Sandman is incredibly beautiful and moving (amazing music here), the character is not completely developed.  The same can be said for Venom...as great as it was to see him on screen, his part in the film seems tacked on and would have been better suited as a great cliffhanger ending (ala Spider-man 2). <br /> <br />With all it's flaws, Spider-man 3 easily bests anything Marvel film since Spider-man 2 and is great fun for fans of all ages.  Considering some of the heavier tones in this story, I'm glad Spidey didn't become a brooding character and I appreciate and enjoy the humor in the series.   <br /> <br />Though it's off-pace at times and lacking in certain elements of character, this is a must see that any fan will enjoy. <br />
B000MV8AE0|5.0|not a box office success, this excellent film was very worth the watching. If you love Beethoven its a no brainer. Ed Harris and the rest of the cast were excellent and I liked the movie visually as well as the exceptionally beautiful music.    I have sent this to my parents and also to my old violin teacher. Its a solid movie, even if you don't love it I doubt you will dislike it, pehaps it's just one of those overlooked flicks that you will be glad to have discovered. That is how I felt.    SBK
B000002MM8|5.0|This is a great CD...go get it if you are into Dead Can Dance! This is their greatest album.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Okay, granted George Lucas is raking in the moola by re-issuing the revised edition of IV through VI with the original theatrical version, and that is not good.  What am I to do with the revised editions that I already purchased?  This is getting way out of hand. <br /> <br />That being said, what a joy to see - widescreen!!! - the original version. Restored I think in quality but not \\"restored\\" in content.  Here is the original crawl of words, without \\"Chapter four: the New Hope\\"  Here is the original, cramped feel to the space stations.  No, Jabba does not appear.  Han shoots first.  Mos Eisley is a small and dangerous looking place rather than a crowded hive of activity.  This is the starker vision we fell in love with, that awed us, and that set our imaginations flowing.  Never mind the crass money-making schemes of GL, just buy it and enjoy the real movie the way George originally wrote and directed it.  Bound by limitations?  Nonsense, George.  The limitations created the world in which the real actors moved, acted and gained our interest.  This is Star Wars.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Okay, so you all know how much I love Linkin Park, right?  Well, I got this CD at a Barnes and Noble near where I live and listened to it the next day (didn't have batteries for my CD player...).  Folks... this is NOT the Linkin Park that everyone has come to know and love.  Where are the brutal screams of \\"From the Inside\\", the flawless vocals of \\"Runaway\\", the mind-spinning verses of \\"Carousel\\"?  Answer: somewhere in the Twilight Zone, cause they sure as hell aren't here.  Also, and what really pissed me off about M2M, was the fact that Mike's rapping is limited to a few, entirely below-average songs; the exception is my favorite song from the CD, \\"Hands Held High\\".  LP tries to get back into the swing of things with their lead single, \\"What I've Done\\", and some other tunes that vaguely remind me of Hybrid Theory, \\"No More Sorrow\\" and \\"Given Up\\", which finds Chester yelling \\"Tell me what the f*ck is wrong!!!\\", but for the most part, Linkin Park's change has dropped them a notch in my book.  For those of you out there who are looking for a H.T. or Meteora-esque CD, you won't find it here.  This is a new LP, granted, but most certainly not a better one.
B000OVLBIU|2.0|Not what we expected....poor acting poor movie in general. Nicolas Cage's career is over. Terrible Flick!
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|BLOW UP (1966) was Michelangelo Antonioni's second color film, and his first in English. Interestingly it was his first film that had a male protagonist. He is considered the master of abstract cinema, and this film continues in that vein. The cinematography was presented in very abstract ways, with most shots framed oddly, blocked by beams, banisters, photographic equipment, windows, and furniture. The camera made no effort to clear these objects in order for us to see the actors. Primary reds were the dominant colors, and in London that seemed easy, passing the double-decker buses and phone booths and pubs, all painted blood red. He painted one apartment building bright blue just for the contrast.<br /><br />Swinging London of the Mods in the mid-60's seemed so wonderfully dated, captured in  its spectacle. Those beehive hair-dos and mini-skirts, smoking that demon joint, the beginnings of the British invasion, that hard rock sound presented in the film by the Yardbirds, the first stages of long hair on men, and the casual way nudity and promiscuity is handled; all old hat to us now, but very brazen then.<br /><br />I loved the way Antonioni gave us the skewed perspective of an unnamed photographer snapping candid shots of a young couple in the park, while the director shot him doing so; an overlapping sense of three perspectives. What the movie camera saw was not exactly what was snapped by the photographer. I loved the parallel of the photographer hopping over the low fence to hide in the bushes to shoot some shots, and then later discovering in exactly the same pose and framed shot, the sniper, the killer, behind the fence in the bushes. And of course the obvious parallels of the artist's abstract paintings, just so many random dots of color, until he capped the painting with some point of view, some detail that drew it all together -and the blow ups themselves, those photos of photos, with pixels blown up so large that they too look like abstract paintings to be interpreted.<br /><br />Some have argued that the park represented Nature versus the pandemonium of the city, and yet what is a park? It is just an artificial large garden planted in the middle, or on the edge of a city, and it \\"represents\\" nature. We go there and have picnics or our lattes and imagine that we are off in the forest or field. This illusionary concept is important to Antonioni. Add to this the sense of each of us remaining strangers midst the teeming masses. The photographer and the mystery lady (David Hemmings and Vanessa Redgrave) both remain nameless. People seem to know them, but never refer to them by their name; very existential. It has been suggested that the director gave us several plot lines that were never meant to make sense, like the antique store scenes; and yet that would be a place that a photographer might haunt. His suggestions that his agent would bid on the store, that he might be a real estate speculator is never explored. Unlike a real photographer who asks permission to shoot a subject, Hemmings always shot secretly; even in the opening scenes, where he pretended to be homeless to shoot those old men in the shelter. Then there is the issue as to what was reality. Hemmings thinks he saw a corpse in the park when he visited it again, and yet he was not carrying his ever present camera. Why not? It seems to suggest that any of us alone witnessing something has no validity. We must find another human being to collaborate our find, to verify our conclusions.<br /><br />Then the director gave us the \\"Merry Makers\\", the 8-10 Mimes that traveled around in an open jalopy, panhandling and performing, providing a prologue and epilogue. Their wordless game of tennis became the most \\"real\\" thing the photographer encountered, as he accepted their non-reality. As Antonioni made the character disappear in the grassy field, it made us wonder if any of the story had happened, or was it an allegory or dream. A complex and provoking film, it never fails to tantalize, a provoke attempts to make sense out of a senseless act.film, it never fails to tantalize, a provoke attempts to make sense out of a senseless act.  <br />

I just watched the film again after all these years, still affects me.  Great movie.  Excellent acting by the young Terrance Stamp.  He played the sweet role quite well.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|I saw Linkin Park's new album while scanning the CD racks at Target, and thought I'd give it a go for old-times sake.  LP was the first band that I truly got into, but I grew out of them somewhere in my musical development.  To this day, I can only listen to about five songs off of Meteora and Hybrid Theory combined.    With that said, I was amazed by LP's new album.  From the get-go (an instrumental piece making strong use of keyboards and serving as basically an overview to the CD), the sound has changed.  The lyrics are matured, the instrumentals are much sounder, there's less rapping; LP even rounds out their sound with a few slow, ballad-type songs.    I'm not saying their aren't bad parts.  I enjoyed Chester's old voice, but the new voice does fit the music better.  The harder rap sections really made Hybrid Theory, but again less rapping fits this CD much more.    Linkin Park has evolved out of the angsty, depressed, teen-age rock that made them famous.  From a musical perspective, it's not a bad thing; but if you listen to Linkin Park for that sound then go listen to the old stuff.    Rating: 4.5 stars
B000KQGP2G|3.0|Scarsick is the long-awaited sequel to Pain of Salvation's masterpiece \\"The Perfect Element I\\", and a new experience in and of itself.  It picks up the story where it left off, and follows He, the male character of the first part.<br /><br />I will start with the downsides.  This album is not on the same league with other Pain of Salvation albums, at all.  The concept is not as humane and appealing as it has always been before (even in the remotely mechanical \\"One Hour by the Concrete Lake\\").  The lyrical content, while filled to brim with poetry and incredibly stunning writing, has shifted itself to a new ground that I wish they had left unexplored, or explored in a metaphorical way.  That's exactly what Scarsick is; straightforward, in-your-face, unrestrained anger and frustration reeking through the now much more simpler music.  The first half alienates you too much, and fuels your expectations for the second part, which are, somehow, not quite fulfilled.  The song, \\"America\\" deviates from the story and doesn't connect at all; a VERY loose end, something that didn't exist in the previous ones, and its purpose, while evident, smashes the overall nice album's flow, mood, atmosphere and context significantly.  The album, while managing to be angry at times, is overall too emotionless, catching emotion with a few songs, if at all.  The overall story suddenly reverts back to where it was and then ends after significant deviation; while this is connected with the story, it could have been better.<br /><br />As for the positive sides, PoS, as always, is coming up with something new in musical terms; \\"Spitfall\\" is a melodic rap-metal song, \\"Disco Queen\\" is a psychedelic/disco song, \\"Scarsick\\" is (unfortunately) similar to a nu-metal song with folk tendencies, \\"Idiocracy\\" is a ballad and \\"Enter Rain\\" is a closer; something for everyone.  The criticism of popular music and idea of popularity, and overall rundown capitalist society is appropriate mostly and very witty (save for \\"America\\", which is downright stupid) and it succeeds for the most part in conveying a social commentary through a child's eyes.  The band displays the fun they had and the thoughts they had in the process, so, to quote Daniel Gildenlow, it IS a very \\"band-oriented\\" album indeed.  It is more easily accessible; which is also a downside, because it doesn't keep you wanting to find out more of the intricacies (assuming there are any).  But the biggest upside is, PoS is trying something new.<br /><br />Overall, this is a bad album in the up-to-now almost flawless PoS discography.  It is subject to debate among many fans, but I would recommend this album for anyone and everyone, save for those who want to start listening to Pain of Salvation (for whom, The Perfect Element is the perfect start)save for \\"America\\", which is downright stupid) and it succeeds for the most part in conveying a social commentary through a child's eyes.

1563899426|4.0|Bill Willingham's FABLES series have received immense acclaim in the last few years as an original idea that appeals to all sorts of readers.  The basic premise is that all of our favorite characters from the old fairy tales have been driven from their old homes and have taken up residence in New York City.  These characters from legend do not always have the personality or history you'd expect from reading the old stories.  Prince Charming is a notorious ladies man and moocher, who cheated on Snow White with Snow's own sister Rose Red.  The prince who was cursed to live as a frog until a beautiful princess kissed him appears to have picked up some rather disgusting habits during his days as an amphibian (and thus earns the name 'Flycatcher').  Beauty and the Beast have some marital problems with rather dramatic effects on their happiness and the Beast's looks.  And so on..  Willingham has created an intriguing world where he can develop characters from old tales into more believably fallible people.  The rather risque behavior of some of the characters and the [almost] explicit nature of occasional sex scenes make these stories for a more mature audience than the tales these characters come from.<br /><br />In this first volume, Willingham introduces a wide array of characters and hints at some extraordinarily entertaining stories to come.  The only reason I'm giving this volume a 4-star rating is that the primary storyline (Who Killed Rose Red?) isn't very good, being predicable and non-engaging.  It seems that Bill began with this rather dull story to give the reader the feel of day-to-day life in Fabletown and to allow introduction of many or its residents.  Snow White and Bigby Wolf are especially well-developed here and will likely take on primary roles in the other FABLE titles.<br /><br />The most attractive aspect of the FABLES series is the humanization of creatures and characters from storybooks that we read as children.  Rose Red as a party girl and the Big Bad Wolf as a chain-smoking, no-nonsense detective are strangely attractive.the Big Bad Wolf as a chain-smoking, no-nonsense detective are strangely attractive.

Myself and a few others planned on attending their concert in Chicago. But, of course their U.S. tour was sadly called off after the death of drummer Johm Bonham. Maybe not as great as Zeppelin's 'IV', 'Houses Of The Holy' or 'Physical Graffiti' (my personal favorites) but still a decent effort. Tracks that managed to make it to the late night 'FM staple play list' for at least awhile were the refreshing \\"In The Evening\\", \\"Fool In The Rain\\", the upbeat \\"Hot Dog\\", \\"All My Love\\" and the bluesy \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\". Worthy of a place in your music collection.

B00005JPFF|3.0|<br />The original Spider-Man was my favorite of the series. From it's classic \\"Spider-Man-first-learning-to-use-his-powers\\" scenes to the climax on the bridge, I thought it was a truly engaging movie. And the second one for me mostly followed suit. <br /> <br />I have to tell you, I had really high expectations for this third one, mostly based on the fact that I really enjoyed the trailer. However, I've come to realize that trailers these days really can make a movie look like a classic even when it isn't. <br /> <br />\\"Spider-Man 3\\" was a major let-down for me. For one thing, it was so LONG. And, as I said in my title, the 3 villains clogged the plot to the point where it became a chore to watch. The whole thing for me felt like it was made by a different director, though it wasn't.  <br /> <br />Besides the basic lower overall quality in the movie, it also was plagued by ridiculous ssequences, such as when the Sandman was escaping the police in the \\"marshlands\\". While the cops were a mere 10 feet away, they let loose their dogs on him. Sandman proceeded to punch out one of the dogs and hop over a random fence, leaving one the policemen to ridiculously ask, \\"Where did he go?\\". And to top of the sheer lunacy of the scene, Sandman then, after hopping over the fence, fell into a pit of sand, apparently being used for a scientific experiment. It then cuts to one of the scientists down in a lab saying \\"There's something on the monitor.\\" The other one replies \\"It's probably just a bird.\\" By the way, none of this gets explained later on in the movie. <br /> <br />The entire \\"Black Spider-Man\\" segment was for me, the low-point of the entire movie. Tobey Maguire made a complete fool of himself in this portion of the film. It started off with a completely unnessecary moment when Spider-Man looked at himself in the mirror and played with his hair, making it look more \\"emo\\". He then looked like a complete idiot while dancing on the sidewalk in his black dress suit, pointingat beautiful women. People at the theater I was at were at were laughing at this point, but I was too busy cringing. And then to finish it off, there was an absolutely painful-to-watch scene in which Spider-Man escorts Gwen Stacey to the jazz club where Mary Jane works to get her jealous. He proceeds to play the jazz piano, dance with Gwen Stacey, and throw off his coat, making Gwen Stacey's hair blow back.  <br /> <br />The final action sequence was alright, though it still contained some riduculously cheesy moments, such as Spider-Man jumping in front of a billowing American flag, a completely unnessecary moment. Also, there were some absolutely awful TV News reporters, including a questionable British journalist and an old TV news anchor who at one point solemnly reported: \\"This could be the end of Spider-Man.\\" Looking back, I couldn't have agreed more. <br /> <br />The entire thing was grade-A cheese. Now why in the world would I give this thing 3 stars? Well, it was entertaining, I will give them that. And for another thing, I obviously felt strong enough about it to actually write a review. And finally, I saw it twice, once with my friends, once with my family. The second time around, it really wasn't as bad, as my expectations weren't as high, and I could enjoy it for what it was. <br /> <br />\\"Spider-Man 3\\" I believe made $148 million at the box office in its first weekend, shattering box office records. It saddens me to picture Peter Jackson in the back row, shaking his head. What has this world come to? <br /> <br />-MALLARD
0451169514|4.0|I vividly remember watching the film adaptation of Stephen King's \\"It\\" novel when I was nine years old...Nightmares ensued incessantly. The concept of \\"It\\" is responsible for my preposterous fear of clowns as a child (and you could even say now, reaching adulthood). <br />  As great and scary as the film adaptation was, it pales in comparison to the novel. Having actually read the 1000+ page novel, I have come to adulate King's writing gift. His attention to detail and character development is staggering. Upon completing the novel, one would feel he throroughly knows Derry and the seven main characters (Bill, Beverly, Ben, Eddie, Mike, Richie, and Stan). <br />  The form in which the novel is written is terrific. King begins with perhaps the most memorable part of the book (and film): Georgie's death. This instantly grips the reader and compells him to read further.  <br />  Subsequently the reader is introduced to the other characters as children, then as adults. This form is perhaps why the novel is so genius. It first gives the reader a glimps into the past and the future. <br />  But as much as I may laude \\"It,\\" I still have to say that I felt the the novel could have definitely been condensed. I felt that at times the story draged on.....and on....But ultimately, it does all coalesce and makes a hell of a creepy book, although not necessarily scary. <br />  Along with \\"The Shinning\\" and \\"'Salem's Lot,\\" this book is my favorite of King's. Anyone who wishes to be spooked and feel uncomfortable when going to bed, should definitely read \\"It.\\" Just remember that it might take a while to finish this mastadon of a novel.
B000059T1V|5.0|Newport 1960, the mecca of a yearly festival of live Jazz that crossed over the greats of the day, and I do mean Greats,into a larger audience where the money and acclaim justifiably started to flow was not lost on this wonderful blues-man who with the likes of jazz men like Cannonball Adderley, Chet Baker and others did a lot of good for inspiring groups like the Stones and others whose homage to Muddy is clear.<br /><br />Creating rock and roll from pure live excitement from albums like this and another legend's stellar album, BB King's Live At The Regal LP are benchmarks for much that followed.<br /><br />As to this wonderful CD, great sound, nice notes, mono studio bonus tracks found on the live portion makes this a worthwhile companion with historical importance while not forgetting the contributions made by Middy's band of pianist Otis Spann,the harmonica of James Cotton, an artist in his own right,and a special treat, the inclusion of the poet Langston Hughes within the proceedings.

0345479092|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about Tracy and the Baby Whisperer books.  I read quite a few popular books while pregnant and have been meaning to write this review for a while, as my son is almost 5 months old.  I followed her advice since bringing him home as I tend to need a little structure in my own life and felt I needed a little help.  Her common sense guide gave me confidence that I was doing a good job, like a friend to rely on with consistent advice that always proved true.  To this day I do not know if we have an easy baby, or if he is easy because I followed her advice.  He is sleeping 12 hours by 4 months and is always well rested because I followed her \\"loose schedule\\" and advice.  I think this is a must for anyone who wants help and who likes the idea of a routine, but always reading baby's cues, not a strict schedule.
B000ICM5IK|5.0|The film \\"Rocky Balboa\\" did what \\"Rocky V\\" tried but failed to do; namely, wrap up the series in a positive way that left longtime fans satisfied. The same can be said for the soundtrack, which is an excellent combination of Bill Conti's original scores and the original artist rock tracks from Rocky III and IV. \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" still sounds great after all these years, as does \\"Redemption\\", the terrific theme of \\"Rocky II\\" which is a bit overlooked. \\"Going the Distance\\" is the perfect boxing theme, as it is both dramatic and triumphant. Softer tracks like \\"Adrian\\" and \\"Mickey\\" are appropriate because they show the other side of Rocky's character as someone who cared deeply about those who were closest to him. The original rock songs sound great too, and will bring back many fond memories from the films: \\"Eye of the Tiger\\", \\"No Easy Way Out\\", \\"Heart's On Fire\\", \\"Burning Heart\\" and \\"Living in America\\" all sound as fresh and lively as they did in the 1980's. Many probably don't like the inclusion of 36 Mafia's \\"It's a Fight\\", but I don't mind it too much; it was the entrance theme for Mason Dixon, after all, and it does accurately portray his self-confident image.  To be sure, this soundtrack is not perfect: there doesn't seem to be much justification for \\"Can't Stop the Fire\\" from Rocky V, though I suppose the producers felt that there should be at least one song from that film. The remix of \\"Gonna Fly Now\\", while not bad, sounds as if they tried to make it too modern, and that misses the point; what makes the original version so great is that it still sounds so good 30 years later.  Overall, this is an excellent disc, especially for a fan like me who came in relatively late (\\"Rocky Balboa\\" was actually the first Rocky film I saw, and I loved it so much I rented the first five!) It would have been nice if they had replaced \\"Can't Stop the Fire\\" and \\"Fanfare\\" with some better tracks, but that is a small gripe for an otherwise excellent collection of music.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I agree with the spotlight reviews that I saw on page 1 of this site. Yes it is wonderful to hear the Beatles in ear popping, 2006, technological splendor. George Martin has always been a genious with the Beatles' music,and with his son Giles, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  It's nice to know that the torch has been passed to a family member. In the hands of Giles Martin this music will continue to shine. I particularly love the tasteful string arrangement added to Harrison's Anthology version of While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and George's voice sounds so clear, it tingles the spine. It is actually an emotional experience to hear, as are several of the tracks on this cd. A standout for me is, I Want to Hold Your Hand, live at the Hollywood Bowl. You can hear every note of George's guitar, and their voices sound so life like, I feel like I am sitting on the stage with them. Mind you, this is a 1964 recording of a live show, and it sounds that good. As a sonic experience, it is eons away from the 1977 Hollywood Bowl Album. I was disappointed that it was so brief. It then segues into a combo of Help and What You're Doing which is also great. If this brief snippit of the Hollwood Bowl concert is any indication, then  why haven't the entire Bowl concerts from 1964 and '65 been issued on cd with this mind boggling sound quality? I understand that Apple/EMI/Capitol/Paul/etc. doesn't want to cheapen the Beatles original catalogue with too much product, and I agree with that. But please this one double or triple cd would be so lovely to have. I just don't see any reason why it hasn't been issued. It would certainly sell, especially since there are no live Beatles albums to be had...legitimently that is.  <br /> <br />     In the mean time, while I'm waiting...and waiting... for my Hollywood Bowl cd,this Love cd is a very different and welcome edition to my collection. I bought it in November while I was out doing my Christmas shopping, and played it for the first time while baking for Thanksgiving, and as any Beatle listener will tell you, it is unbelievable. My kids,ages 11 and 14(both Beatle fans since birth) couldn't believe what they were hearing. My 14 year old saying, \\"WHAT IS THIS?\\"  \\"What did they do to the songs?\\" You will have to hear it to understand it. While it is not a substitute for the original cds, it is still fun to listen to. Paul and Ringo loved it and spurred the Martins on, and that's not surprising,considering the Beatles quircky sense of the absurd, and refusal to take themselves seriously. I know John and George would have been thrilled also. You will too, but don't buy this one if you don't already have the 13 original cds. Nothing can replace those cds. 'Love' is just a fun change of pace for Beatlephiles.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|Outstanding product.  Perfect for either a seasoned fan or novice of the television show.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This CD is so balanced when it comes to the sounds you get on it. I can't say that i'd categorize it as a certain type of metal, I know some would call it power metal, symphonic metal etc. But to the lay man, this is a wonderful metal CD with epic orchestral overtones blended perfectly against ravage riffs and powerful voices.<br /><br />Again, it's so nicely balanced. Dark Chest of Wonders slams you into what the band is all about and what they're capable of producing. Wish I Had an Angel is one or those groovin' \\"drive\\" songs, with a nice touch of dark, and (likewise to other tracks) it showcases the sorrowful tones and agressive attack of both the female and male vocalists (Tarja and Marco, he also doubles as the bassist). The licks, chords and riffs in the CD are so solid, if you're looking for a break and release from a lot of 'sloppy metal', you'll love this.<br /><br />In addition, songs like Creek Mary's Blood feature Native-American drums and chants in an eerie-sweet balad. There's even a pure orchestral song titled Kuolema Tekke Taiteilijan, a piece written in the band's native language (the hail from Finland).<br /><br />All in all, Once is quite the inspiring CD, and just when you want more from the CD, this particular pressing comes with two fabulous bonus tracks. A highly recommended purchase for your musical entertainment and pleasure.
B000JK8OYU|2.0|All the songs are previous released material except 'Gnik Nus' which is only a reverse version of the 'Sun King'<br />It begins promising with a nice madrigal rendering of 'Because', but soon most of the other songs are mixed with too much psychedelic noise so that for instance the steady beat of 'Get Back' gets lost completely in noises that are totally irrelevant. I prayed the Lord that at least the beautiful 'Eleanor Rigby' would be the original recording and thanks Heaven it was. Only a few other songs (there are 20 songs) like 'I Want To Hold Your Hand' are also the original recording.<br /><br />You get the feeling that this CD is a mere potpourri of Beatles songs. The only positive thing is that the remix is very well done in so far that you have the feeling to stand between The Beatles while they are singing.<br />So far for the quality of this recording. The philosophy of the producers (George Martin and Giles Martin.) seems to be that The Beatles are a symbol for the psychedelic late 60's and early 70's and they seem to ignore the fact that The Beatles had their greatest successes in the mid 60's like for instance the above mentioned 'I Want To Hold Your Hand.' I call that a one-sided vision.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I discovered Nightwish & listened to a few sound bits after following a web link from another site. What I heard was GREAT!, so I just had to check them out. I am VERY PLEASED with this album. This prog rock band (very similar to Renaissance) seem to not be very well known in the States, but is very big to Europe. I believe you will be very pleased with what you hear & like myself will be purchasing other CD's by the group.
B000O1799U|4.0|This is a great big blast of glitter and glitz, fun and entertaining. For those who haven't heard the plot a million times already, I'll recap. The Dreamettes, fronted by belter Effie (Jenifer Hudson, totally earning that Oscar) catch a lucky break and start working as singers for a fading James \\"Thunder\\" Early (Eddie Murphy, a revelation as a mash-up of sixties soul singers from Wilson Picket to James Brown to Marvin Gaye). The ersatz Berry Gordy character Curtis Taylor Jr (a lackluster Jamie Foxx) decides to move the less powerful but prettier Deena Jones (Beyonce, giving an eerie Diana Ross impersonation) to the front of the newly christened Dreams. As the sixties and seventies cascade about them, the conflict between these four drives the movie and the music.<br /><br />Fortunately for \\"Dreamgirls,\\" the musical performances carry the day. I don't find many of the songs here to be all that memorable - other than \\"One Night Only\\" and \\"Cadillac Car,\\" I have a hard time humming any of these once the DVD is over. But to see Hudson bring the house down with her version of the original centerpiece \\"And I'm Telling You Now I'm Not Going\\" is an astonishing career-maker of a scene, and Murphy steals the show just about every number he does. (As for all the Theatre Snobs decrying Hudson Vs Holliday, did you ever stop to think about how few people actually SAW the play with Holliday in it? Like, over 20 years ago? It's like saying the current stage play of \\"Mary Poppins\\" will never be right because Julie Andrews isn't in it.)<br /><br />THAT grouse aside, \\"Dreamgirls\\" is not without its flaws. As previously stated, Jamie Foxx seems miscast here. While Murphy is brilliant, the wide range of styles he's run through (from James Brown bark to Marvin Gaye 'message song' croon) seems unwieldy for the character. Anika Noni Rose is bubbly and fun, but gets little by way of memorable scenes. With those out of the way, I still enjoyed this. Watch for the cameos from John Lithgow and Loretta Devine (Lorrell Robinson in the original Broadway production) as the jazz singer in the wake scene.<br /><br />I am happy to see \\"Dreamgirls\\" as the success it's become. It gives me hope that the Movie Musical genre that has been given shots in the arm via \\"[[ASIN:B00005QZ7U Moulin Rouge! (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B00005JLSE Chicago (Widescreen Edition)]]\\" and - to a lesser extent - \\"[[ASIN:B000E1YVZU Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]]\\" will be given an ongoing forum.and Loretta Devine (Lorrell Robinson in the original Broadway production) as the jazz singer in the wake scene. <br /> <br />I am happy to see \\"Dreamgirls\\" as the success it's become.

0393061310|3.0|When I was doing study abroad in Costa Rica, I wrote an essay that covered part of the ambitious theme that is tackled in Guns, Germs, and Steel. Little did I know at the time that Jared Diamond had addressed it in this comprehensive book--not only addressed it, but addressed it thoroughly, and, in fact, bordered on beating the topic to death ... bordered, but not crossed. When I later heard about the premise of Guns, Germs, and Steel, and since the topic of why Europeans had the edge up on other societies was one I had often been fascinated with, I knew that I had to read it. When I finally got the book, it started out being exactly what I was looking for, and I read with increasing interest. Then, at about the half way point, I noticed that I was becoming fatigued with the topic and ready for a slam bang conclusion. Unfortunately, I still had plenty of reading to go. The freshness of Diamond's ideas and approach were gone, and I really didn't feel like I was learning anything ground-breakingly new in the last half of the book. I kept on thinking, \\"Yeah, I believe you. No more examples.\\" Now, that doesn't sound too flattering, but I think I must emphasize that I went into this reading with high expectations, and for the first half of the book, those expectations were met. That meant that Jared Diamond took a highly scientific and immensely broad subject and made it both personal and interesting; something not easily accomplished. Mr. Diamond's careful, if not meticulous view of each and every angle of the world's civilizations acts as both his strength and, for me, his eventual weakness. Though, I don't know if I can rightly adjust the blame of this to Jared Diamond, or whether I should attach it instead to the length of the history of the world. Too many civilizations over too many continents forced Mr. Diamond to address all of them or be faced with an incomplete academic exploration. Looking back on it, however, the perspective Jared Diamond provides is invaluable, and while there were a few instances where I felt that he was stepping into too much speculation, for the most part his logic was well grounded and felt indisputable. Above all, Mr. Diamond's case studies and examples brought the two facets of credibility and interest together, a pair that is not normally attributed to highly academic books. I finished the book with satisfaction, but also with relief. I only hope that our current civilizations don't change too much, if only for keeping this book to its current page limit. But if an extension is needed, I can't imagine anyone more worthy of it that Jared Diamond.le, and while there were a few instances where I felt that he was stepping into too much speculation, for the most part his logic was well grounded and felt indisputable.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|I was a huge fan of their first album, Hybrid theory, because it was something different than the norm, then the band began to blend with other artists in the rap rock genre. I believe that this was the only direction they could have gone. The album as a whole did not break any real ground, no new bonds will be formed, but I do think that it is worth giving a listen. Some tracks are harder than others, but ballads are predominate on this disc, the rap rock thing has all been hung out to dry. However when they do use it on this disc it is worth it and amazing. Songs like \\"Bleed it Out: and \\"Hold Nothing Back\\" are worth the money alone.

B000O5AYCA|5.0|The first thing you'll notice about this album is how slow it is. Only two songs, \\"Mistaken for Strangers\\" and \\"Apartment Story\\", rock in any kind of recognizable way. Others like \\"Racing Like a Pro\\" and \\"Ada\\" barely resemble rock music at all. The band's previous album, Alligator, was full of big rock songs and topped many critics and bloggers best of 2005 lists. This has largely been abandoned on the follow-up Boxer, a series of dark, mellow tracks, populated with low baritone vocals, horns, strings, pianos, etc. <br /> <br />If you've followed the band's previous work, you may be slightly disappointed by the lack of screaming or upbeat rock songs. There's nothing like \\"Slipping Husband\\", \\"Available\\", \\"Abel\\" or \\"Mr. November\\" to be found on here. What's left is a great mellow record that sounds like a continuation of the band's Cherry Tree EP from 2004. Highlights include \\"Brainy\\", \\"Slow Show\\", \\"Ada\\" and \\"Gospel\\". Give this record a little bit of time to grow on you. It was just released today, but I've been listening to a leaked copy for about two months (I bought an official copy today).  <br /> <br />This band was originally labeled as alt-country, but has now become darker and more artsy than YHF-era Wilco. Each album has been an interesting change of pace and atmosphere. Check out their previous albums The National (2001), Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers (2003), Cherry Tree Ep (2004) and Alligator (2005). I highly recommend them all, including this one. This is one of the best American bands making music today.

B00000D9TQ|4.0|I'll start off by saying that, in my eyes, there are two sides to Phil Collins. The first side is the pop mastermind side. This particular facet of the Phil Collins persona is able to construct some spot-on catchy tunes. The other side, however, is a pap manufacturer. Rather than giving us pop nuggets, this side of Phil Collins prefers to sneeze out some of the cheesiest ballads that ever befell mankind. <br /> <br />I, for one, prefer pop mastermind Phil. <br /> <br />The reasons for that are evident here on the Hits compilation. \\"Take Me Home,\\" for instance, is one of my favourite tunes ever. Take a tremendous hook, captivating percussion and make it universal and BAM!, you've got a classic. It's nothing but pop, sure, but it holds up remarkably well. Other tunes tinker with even poppier sensibilities (i.e., \\"Sussudio\\" and \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\"), while others take Phil into a brooding (\\"In the Air Tonight\\") or socially-conscious (\\"Another Day in Paradise\\") territory. Either way, it works. <br /> <br />Then, there's pap Phil. Dreadfully insipid ballads plagued his career, and alas, they're on here too. A good part of this compilation's midsection is devoted to this hapless drivel, unfortunately. Oh well. We can live with that (i.e., skip ahead to the good numbers). <br /> <br />Overall, though, this compilation shows us the two faces of Phil Collins' work. One is remarkable, the other is not. In addition to the 80s pop cliches, there is a good mix of styles here, including faux-60s soul, 90s-styled R&B (ugh...). If you hate Phil Collins, just give this thing a spin:  You might grow to dig one of his two facets.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had seen commercial for the series time to time, both when it ran on Fox and again later for Universal HD but I had never seen the show. After renting the first disk I liked it so much I bought the show.  It has to be one of the better sci fi shows I can remember.  I have since seen the movie, another gem!!!  I highly recommend this show, but I warn you it is addictive!
B000P2A256|5.0|I've been playing this c.d. since I got it.  Their last c.d., Songs About Jane was good, this is far better.   <br /> <br />Most music coming out today is crap, but these guys are certainly talented.  This c.d. will have a permanent place on my iPod.
B000FCUV5C|4.0|I can see why this album is a classic masterpiece of hard rock, with the story it tells and the excellent arrangements.  The music is varied in feel and takes the listener along for the ride through the story.  I think it would be a good idea to make it into a film, as Geoff Tate has been considering.  This music is a very good example of intelligent hard rock/metal.   <br /> <br />I first heard OM many years back when I picked up Empire, but it didn't really grab me for some reason.  I revisited it recently and decided to finally pick it up.  I found this 'remastered' version with a complete live performance on a second disc.  I assumed this would be the best presentation of the album.  I was sadly mistaken.  The person who mastered this re-release (Everen Goeknar according to the notes) did a poor job in my opinion.  The entire set is overmodulated, i.e. the volume level is too high.  This results in distortion of the bad kind, which sounds somewhat  like static from a poor radio reception.  It's not too bad on the studio disc, just a little bit in the more intense sections of the music.  But the live disc suffers much more.  You can even hear it right at the beginning with the nurse's voice.   <br /> <br />Honestly, I'm not sure what you could do to make a late-80's recording sound noticably better.  So I don't think it needed a remastering so to speak (it would be interesting to do a side-by-side comparison with the original CD release).  It is a real shame that they tried to and made it worse.  Quit trying to make the CD's themselves louder!  That's what the volume knob is for! <br /> <br />I'd give this set 5 stars if it wasn't for the sub-par mastering.
B00001SIES|5.0|This, Muse's first album, turned out to be the very last one I got the opportunity to listen to. The sound is definitely younger and less polished and complex, but the clear signs of genius are already present.<br /><br />\\"Unintended\\" struck a strong, poignant chord with me, being perhaps the closest Muse comes to a balladic love song. It's also a good one for singing in the shower! :) \\"Muscle Museum\\" is also a strong track, and the rest of the album rounds out nicely. Solid Muse.
B000NIVJGI|1.0|I bought this blue-ray disc, it keeps on spinning (with the logo of a few wheels turning with the word \\"Loading\\"), and never finish loading, and never get to the menu to play the content.  Does anybody have the same problem?
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Muse's second album is an adventure in style and sound, from the tinkling piano introduction of \\"Bliss,\\" to the rocking and rollicking \\"Plug In Baby,\\" to the jazzy, lilting \\"Feeling Good.\\" Joining Freddie Mercury, Matthew Bellamy has quickly become one of my favorite musical geniuses.<br /><br />I have experienced Muse's four albums in a somewhat reverse order (3,4,2,1), which makes me curious how my perceptions might have been different had I gotten to know them chronologically. I highly recommend all of their albums.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|This is a great movie. It's about a guy who hates meat. Every day he wake up and wants to pound on meat. His dream finaly comes true and a meat shop guy lets him pound on meat. There are other aspects of the movie as well (something about boxing or whatever) but the main theme is how much this guy hates meat. It's just lunch.
0393327655|4.0|I was very entertained by Sam Harris's writing style.  His degree is in philosophy though he is currently working on a Ph.D. in neuroscience, so his writing reflects both fields. The text itself is 221 pages with an additional 62 pages of footnotes. Harris sees religious faith as the main culprit for much of the world's woes. Given his definition of faith, the book may just as well have been titled \\"The End of Irrationality\\", \\"The End of Certainty without Evidence\\" or \\"The End of Dogma\\". While his criticism of Christianity and Islam is merciless, he only briefly contends with the fact that apparently atheist regimes have also committed atrocities. The book's original treatment of this subject is very scant in my opinion (characterizing communism as \\"little more than a political religion\\" p79). The Afterword (added in the 2005 edition I have?) addresses this criticism, but devotes less than a page to the topic. One of the most frequently cited criticisms of atheism surely deserves a chapter of its own alongside Christianity and Islam. <br /> <br /> The notion of exactly what constitutes religion, a problem that many an anthropologist has wrestled with, is not really dealt with here.  The book is primarily a wake-up call on the growing influence of Christian fundamentalism in this country, extremist Islam everywhere else, and an expose of how central tenants of these religions are based not on critical consideration of evidence, but rather on denial, desire for certainty, and other emotional factors. <br /> <br />The picture Harris paints of both religions is fairly black and white. Readers are confronted with some of the more shocking parts of the bible that are often left unread and undiscussed in churches. The inquisition is described in grueling detail. A case is made that the Koran contains even more outrageous and outright murderous lines and, as such, a moderate interpretation is nearly impossible without denial and elaborate contortions of reasoning.  The implications for worldwide conflict are obvious. Readers should rightly feel that the assessment here is incomplete at best. One cannot expect to make a reasonable overall assessment of either text's net value in a few pages. No  attempt is made by Harris to discuss any of the more valued passages in the texts for merit. He simply dismisses them: \\"Most of what remains - the \\"good parts\\" - has been spared the same winnowing because we do not yet have a truly modern understanding of our ethical intuitions and our capacity for spiritual experience\\" (p20). The latter half of this statement is an allusion to the latter part of his book that focuses on ethics, philosophy and ideas from Eastern religions. <br /> <br />Religious moderates in general are castigated by Harris for betraying both faith and reason equally and for \\"relaxing standards of adherence to ancient superstitions and taboos, while otherwise maintaining a belief system that was passed down to us from men and women whose lives were simply ravaged by their basic ignorance about the world.\\" (p21). Aside from a passing reference to Paul Tillich (p65), who Harris dismisses as a \\"blameless parish of one\\", there is no discussion of the growing non-theist movement in Christianity inspired by Tillich (John Spong, Jesus Seminar, Westar Institute, and other liberal theologians), nor is there much discussion of other moderate religious movements that have come out of Islam: Sufism, Baha'i etc. Harris acknowledges that \\"It does not seem much of an exaggeration to say that the fate of civilization lies largely in the hands of \\"moderate\\" Muslims\\" (p152). Unfortunately, there is little substance in his text as to how we should develop a working relationship with religious moderates other than to blast them for putting too much value on tolerance and creating an air which stifles direct criticism of their more conservative cousins'  basic tenants. On a global scale, Harris seems to advocate unilateral military action, benign dictatorships, and eventual world government (p150).  <br /> <br />Harris apparently takes as dim a view of metaphorical interpretation of scripture as does a biblical literalist. Fans of Joseph Campbell looking for a discussion of the role of myth will be disappointed (if not offended by his characterization of Campbell in a footnote).  Harris puts forward a humorous and obviously bogus metaphorical interpretation of a recipe for fish in the footnotes to illustrate his point.  <br /> <br />Theology is characterized as \\"little more than a branch of human ignorance\\" (p173).  The informed reader will sense more than one branch of human ignorance occasionally at work here. <br /> <br />The last several chapters depart from the basic theme of the book and touch upon ethics and the nature of consciousness.  With rational thought now firmly in control, Harris visits several ethical issues of present interest. Pacifism is branded as \\"flagrantly immoral\\" and Harris argues that violence (or its threat) is sometimes an ethical necessity (p199).  Similar arguments are made for the use of torture (p192).  One wonders if many of the Muslims answering \\"yes\\" to the question of suicide bombing ever being justified (survey on p126) haven't done similar moral calculations that Harris makes here. <br /> <br />Atheists and skeptics alike may find some comments earlier in the book unsettling: \\"There also seems to be a body of data attesting to the reality of psychic phenomena, much of which has been ignored by mainstream science\\" . Naturally, Harris does demand that rigorous scientific principles must be applied to any such studies (p41).  In his section \\"Experiments in Consciousness\\", he attempts to make the case that consciousness may be more than simply the biochemical workings of the brain. While admitting that there is much to be said against the concept of an independent soul, Harris' line of argument starts by claiming that the idea that brains produce consciousness is \\"little more than an article of faith among scientists\\" (p208).  That scientists cannot yet pin down the concept of consciousness, however, lends no credibility to any theories of independent consciousness. Readers familiar with the creationism vs. evolution debate will find this line of argument familiar. In the footnotes, Harris attempts to dismiss the argument that lack of memory during general anesthesia supports the idea that consciousness can be halted.  He argues that we all dream during normal sleep but we do not always remember. While lack of memory is not evidence of lack of consciousness, it lends no support whatsoever to the opposing viewpoint. Once again, Harris ventures uncomfortably close to false dichotomy.  <br /> <br />The book clearly promotes Eastern religious traditions that value rational examination of the nature of consciousness, though one wonders how Harris' critical view of pacifism and his moral calculus on torture square with this. \\"There is clearly no greater obstacle to a truly empirical approach to spiritual experience than our current beliefs about God\\" (p214). The idea is presented that introspection can be conducted in a rational manner and subjected to the same kinds of rigors as scientific investigation (repeatability). \\"There is clearly a sacred dimension to our existence, and coming to terms with it could well be the highest purpose of human life.\\" (p16) <br /> <br />On the whole, it seems strangely ironic that a book decrying the evils of forming one's perception of reality on questionable evidence and emotional appeals should itself be a dramatic call to action loaded with provocative statements.  I can't help but feel that Harris draws a distorted view of the magnitude of the problem of religious extremism that could easily provoke fear and animosity towards the very moderates with whom we should be encouraging dialog. Indeed, his more recent interviews and articles seem a bit more tempered. That being said, his historical examples, scriptural critique and explorations in ethics should be required reading for anyone seriously wanting to explore the foundations of their own religious beliefs.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Once again, the meat hater comes out of retirement. He doesn't hit any meat in this movie, but he is great. It's just lunch.

B000OCXMAE|2.0|In case you havent picked up on it from the other reviews - this album is a serious departure from what you might expect from Linkin Park. I'm totally open to change with bands, but , I guess this is a perfect example that its not always for the better. TO me, LP means Intensity... songs that make you want to break something, get up, run as fast as you can until your lungs feel like they are going to explode. None of this music will give you that emotion. As said I can understand, that bands change - I think this is SO much of a departure its hard to adjust. Rest in peace LP.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|Honestly, who doesn't know the movie Annie? But this special anniversary dvd has some nice bonus features. You can sing karaoke with or without voice with some of the more popular songs, you can \\"act\\" with Annie in some of the scenes, you can take a quiz about Annie and the 1930's and there is a very nice bonus feature with the lovely woman whom played Annie when she was a child. I do wish there were a few more features, maybe some other cast interviews; but all in all, this is a real treat!
B000P2A256|2.0|Maroon 5 becomes the music industry's newest victim...take a solid, talented band, and produce a piece of musical garbage that you can market.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|The problem with this album is that there are die hard Linkin Park fans that will give 5 star reviews to anything they come out with and haters that will always give negative reviews. Before I say anything about this album, let me just say that I'm a huge fan of LP and have been following them ever since hybrid theory. I have nothing against rap-rock. But objectively, this album falls short of anything LP have done before. It's probably not as good as some of the 5 star reviews and really not deserving of the 1 star reviews. Probably a 3 and half ranking really, It's just an ok album.     Good points:   1) Brad Delson's guitar playing has always been one of the weak points for LP. In this album he takes it up a notch and plays more than the layered chords he is known for.   2) Listen to meteora and you wonder whether or not they have a bass player at all but in this album we can actually hear pheonix's bass   3) Chester shows off his melodic side and proves that he could do more than scream.   4) Mike can sing.  5) They took a risk and tried something new instead of creating a Hybrid Theory Part III.     Bad points:   1) Wake????? In terms of instrumentals, this is no cure for the itch or session. It doesn't even compare to foreward from meteora which as an intro was just brilliant.    2) Was the swearing really necessary? ie. \\"put me of of my f***ing misery\\" adds nothing to the song. It's just pure songwriting laziness.   3) Emo-ish at times. Just way too many sentimental ballads for my taste   4) Mike raps in only 2 songs. I miss the interplay between Mike and Chester that made the Linkin Park sound so unique. Just listen to Points of Authority and compare it to this album and tell me that this dynamic between the two frontmen is not sorely lacking.    5) Doesn't flow as well song to song as their other albums.     The Little Things Give You Away is a standout track, probably one of their best songs musically. Bleed it Out and What I've done are also great tracks.I still love LP. I saw them in concert this summer and they are still energetic and wonderful live. They're probably one of the most underrated bands out there, with too much negative manufactured boy band/nu metal connotations that doesn't really describe how talented they are. But that said... my opinion about this album is that it's not great and I'm sticking with it. You can agree or disagree but don't give me negative comments or say that my review is not helpful because I didn't give them more credit than they deserve on this one.
B000NMABO0|5.0|This Cd is a really good one. \\"Beyond Words\\" is such a great song I'm addicted to it right now, and I have been for some time!! seriously. Great music isn't made great after listening to it once. It is great by hearing it multiple times and if it gives you the same thrill as when you heard it first, it can be considered a classic. and \\"Beyond Words\\" is a classic!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I am a huge fan of anime. I have watched everything from Naruto (unfortunately) to Bleach (highly recommended) but this anime movie is the best I have ever seen. It is a good watch for anyone, even those who simply think of anime as simply a \\"cartoon.\\" The characters are incredibly deep and the usual sense of right and wrong is blurred creating for an incredibly interesting ride. I highly recommend this film to everyone. Hope you enjoy!
B000002LAC|5.0|It goes without saying this is a classic recording and is mentioned numorous times in articles and reviews comparing other recordings to it.  I haven't heard any rumors but it would be fitting if Rhino planned a 20th Anniversary deluxe release - remastered and expanded to 2 discs.  Trio definitely qualifies as an obvious choice for a new remastered release.  I can only hope it is being kept a secret given the little advance information given out for most Rhino releases - the upcoming Emmylou rarities box set included.
B000P0J02E|5.0|Wow, I just bought this score from iTunes and all I can say is that I am very impressed! There is a very epic feeling to this Pirates album, but of course it still has the same pirate feel from the last two scores as well. I am honestly not disappointed in any track on the entire album.  <br /> <br />I only listened to it all the way through once, but my early favorites are: <br />-Singapore <br />-Calypso <br />-What Shall We Die For <br />-Drink Up Me Hearties Yo Ho <br /> <br />Bottom line is that if you like the Pirates movies or scores, there's a good chance you'll like this. I know that I did. I am very impressed with this score and easily give it 5 out of 5.

B000PMGS8G|5.0|A fantastic sci-fi camp masterpiece! I've loved this movie since it was originally released in 1980 and it certainly deserves this re-issue DVD!<br /><br />I've seen a few reviewers complaining that this new release doesn't contain the same \\"special features\\" as the \\"silver anniversary\\" edition (region 2, released a few years ago). While this is true, I honestly don't think we're losing anything of real importance. Let's compare:<br /><br />* The Silver Anniversary Edition (region 2) contains:<br /><br />- Two audio commentaries:<br />Mike Hodges (Director) / Brian Blessed (Actor).<br />- An original Flash Gordon serial<br />- A 30 minute interview with Mike Hodges<br />(Redundant considering the commentary)<br />- Theatrical trailer and photo slide show<br /><br />* This new release contains:<br /><br />- Two featurettes:<br />Alex Ross (Artist) / Lorenzo Semple Jr (Screenwriter).<br />- An original Flash Gordon serial<br />- Theatrical trailer<br /><br />You must remember that this film has been \\"lost\\" for YEARS to the majority of region 1 consumers. Most would never pay the high pices for the old \\"out of print\\" edition, and most are not able to play DVD's from other regions. I feel that the importance of having this film once again available to region 1, at a decent price, far outweighs any argument over special features.<br /><br />But, if you want to argue about special features, that's fine. I don't think EITHER version has the EXTRAS that long time fans would want. The perfect DVD release would contain deleted scenes and interviews with cast members, especially Sam Jones and Melody Anderson (who would also supply commentaries). We can all still hope for the perfect MEGA release of this classic film, but let's not judge this re-issue unfairly and harm the overall success of the release (which could help to determine the fate of future releases).<br /><br />I'm actually looking forward to watching the new feature on Lorenzo Semple Jr. (Legendary Screenwriter ofFlash Gordon, and also one of the original writers of the 60's Batman TV series with Adam West).<br /><br />While I certainly would have hoped for the perfect, feature packed re-release, I'm still THRILLED that this 80's sci-fi adventure will once again be available at a decent price! If you've never seen this film before, now is your chance to get it! It's truly one of a kind!<br /><br />Re-mastered, 2.35:1 anamorphic wide screen, 5.1 Dolby Surround.<br /><br />-JM
B000025H0Q|5.0|I heard an interview with Joe Boyd who produced this and many other British artists in the late 60s and thought that I would pick up one of his personal favorite artists: Nick Drake. It is great, kind of a Donovan sound, better voice and more jazzy. 'Northern Skies' especially is hauntingly great!
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Wow!  That's all I've got to say about United Abominations.  What a great album!  From beginning to the end, it's nothing but pure thrash metal at its finest.  Dave Mustain sounds as good as ever and the other band members step it up a notch.  This album proves that lately, Megadeth is putting out better music than Metallica (such as St. Anger).  If you are a Megadeth fan or any true rock fan, this is a must buy.  I agree with the reviewer above that this could be the album of the year!
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Released in 1969, this album marks Miles full blown emergence into the realm of jazz rock although there are other influences besides jazz and rock including a bit of minimalism. Musically, this recording is very relaxed and is dominated by eerie organ parts and a monotonic acoustic bass and drum parts. I especially like Miles use of space; even when he is not playing it speaks volumes.<br /><br />Apart from Miles (trumpet), the list of musicians on this album reads like a who's who of jazz rock: Herbie Hancock (Fender Rhodes electric piano); Chick Corea (Fender Rhodes electric piano); Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone); Dave Holland (acoustic bass); Joe Zawinul (Fender Rhodes electric piano and organ); the amazing John McLaughlin (electric guitar); and Tony Williams (drums).<br /><br />In spite of the fact that all of these guys are virtuosos, their performances on In a Silent Way are extraordinarily disciplined and restrained. The most notable example of this is Tony Williams, who simply plays a repeated rhythm on the hi-hat for all of the lengthy Shhh/Peaceful - in fact, it is not until near the end of In a Silent Way that he plays the entire kit, and for only a short time. Even John McLaughlin turns in a very sedate performance with clean tones; a marked change from the wildly savage virtuosity that characterized his playing during this early period. Although three keyboardists of such high caliber playing at the same time might not have worked under different circumstances, it works incredibly well here; the different players weave effortlessly in and around one another.<br /><br />The album is split into two lengthy tracks with Shhh/Peaceful clocking in at 18'16\\" and In a Silent Way/It's about that Time running for 19'52\\". The mood of both pieces is very dreamy and quiet, with soft electric piano parts, and shimmering textures on the electric guitar fading in and out. Miles playing is very spacey and drifting - he comes in very so often and blows a few perfect notes and then stops, letting the other players do their thing. This music is deeply reflective and meditative, which is especially borne out in the hypnotic rhythm section.<br /><br />All in all, this is a landmark recording that ushered in a new direction in jazz. Very highly recommended along with Bitches Brew (1970) and the much heavier sounding Jack Johnson (1971). Although a bit controversial, On the Corner (1972) is also recommended.erfect notes and then stops, letting the other players do their thing.

0618680004|3.0|If you have limited time to learn about what atheists don't believe I recommend \\"Letter to a Christian Nation\\" by Sam Harris.  It is much shorter and makes the same basic case. This book goes on too many long and complicated tangents. Time and time again Mr. Dawkins knocks down a fundamentalist who does not realize that faith and reason must not contradict and each time he is not satisfied with the knock down. He proceeds to kick the body on the ground repeatedly with full force of his scientific knowledge. The reading gets a bit tedious, because he keeps making the same point over and over again from a slightly different angle. When you see this happening and you are not especially interested or already know the particular aspect of science he is explaining at great length you can skip over it. I don't think you will miss much. He loves to prove many times that those who interpret ancient religious writings literally are sitting ducks. There is too much negativity in this book.<br />I was disappointed that at the end the author did not become more positive and consider what an atheist world might look like (Karl Marx was so negative on Capitalism but he also had a positive vision of a Worker's Paradise that attracted a really big following).  To the atheist's question: can't we all get along? Would the answer be, \\"Yes we can, now that religion is out of the way?\\" or would Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris start fighting over whose atheism is purer. Would competing atheistic sects form, each claiming to be less tainted by faith than the other? Could any atheistic sect prove that it is completely (100%) rooted in reason and evidence? If not, would that not be a big problem in the long-run? Wouldn't accusations of creeping agnosticism start to fly?<br />This book will change nothing, some religious people who might read it will say, \\"I agree, reason and faith must not contradict, I use the scientific method every day, Dawkins can't be talking about my religion. Science tells him nothing about the supernatural gift I have.\\" Other religious people might pick up the book, page through it a little bit and dismiss it as the devil's work, or something like that.

4893580914|5.0|This book is amazing in its approach to teaching Kanji. It starts off with pictures of the most basic kanji and then it tests you in a practical context. For example, it gives you the layout of a train station and the various directional gates - north, south, east and west, and it includes terms that you would see/use at the train station. Every chapter builds on the previous one. You'll see that, after working on the first three chapters, by the time you get to the third or fourth chapter, you're reading a whole paragraph that includes the kanji that you hopefully mastered previously. This was an invaluable resource in my learning of Kanji.
B000G2YD3C|5.0|I sincerely hope this band is embraced by the prog and ambient rock communities. PRR embues everything I like about atmospheric rock. Some have called it a mellow affair and perhaps compared to death metal it is mellow, but the style here is very dramatic, reminiscent of early Pink Floyd. Like early Pink Floyd, the emphasis is on soundscaping, with lush, etherial, Beach Boy like harmonizing, repleat with keyboard flourishes, yet maintaining a connection to modern goth rock. Its like Polyphonic Spree meets Porcupine Tree meets Riverside.  <br /> <br />Of course, those of you who are familiar with early Pink Floyd will recognize the Floydian references in at least two song titles, Bullets Dominae and Bright Ambassadors of Morning (from the song Echoes). This is not to say that these guys are merely aping Pink Floyd, because they're not at all. The use of male and female vocals gives it distinction from direct comparison. However, don't make the mistake of thinking its another goth band, which also feature male and female lead vocals. No one singer takes center stage here, both male and female are intertwined, and blend perfectly with each other; both are competant vocalists (no acclimation period required).  <br /> <br />Also used throughout is mass choir vocal sections, whether its actually a mass choir or multi-tracking vocals, its a stunning effect. Couple this with a band that very adept at delicate, etherial sounscaping as well as dramatic, symphonic rock, and you have a spectacular prog album. Amazingly enough, as bombastic as the some musical passages are, it doesn't come across as over-the-top theatrical, like with some similar music (Nightwish comes to mind), rather it remains quite organic sounding. <br /> <br />This album is a throwback to a time when an album was an artistic statement, when album flow and feel was as important as the musical contents. Fans of Porcupine Tree or any other Steve Wilson project might find this their cup of tea. Any fan of early Pink Floyd should like this as well. This isn't a band in search of a 'sound', they come across as a band who are playing music they feel. The only question now is how on earth will they follow this stunning debut. Highly recommended.
0060594896|5.0|After watching \\"The Secret\\", I realized that Jack Canfield was not only the Chicken Soup author, but also was quite knowledgable on how the Law of Attraction worked.  I came across this book at my local library, and out of curiousity, I took a look inside.  I don't think it took me more than 2 minutes of browsing, to realize that I had to have this book.<br /><br />This book motivated me like no other book has before. Not because it's full of hype and pie-in-the-sky, but because it actually teaches you step by step, how to create everything you want in your life.  It's much more than saying \\"Get a job you love!\\".  Mr. Canfield actually instructs us on how to find our ideal career.  I have been stuck for 10 years, not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, but after reading this book, I'm finally on the right path.<br /><br />This is one of those revelations, where I feel indebted to Jack Canfield, for finally making me see the light.  I have all the confidence in the world, that I will be one of many future multi-millionaires who got their start, their inspiration and know-how, from reading this book.<br /><br />I can't say enough great things about this book.  It has it all.  If you dare to succeed and be happy and full of joy and peace, then please do yourself a favor and get this book.  You might have read 50 self-help books in the past, but you haven't read anything like this--trust me.  You will be just as blown away as I was, guaranteed.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|The lastest offering from Megadeth is a bit dissapointing to me.  I am an old school Megadeth fan back from Killing is my business days.  In my opinion, United Abominations sounds like everything after Youthanaisa (mediocore).  Don't get me wrong, Dave Mustaine is a personel hero of mine, but I would not listen to this new effort. On the other hand, The System Has Failed was the best thing Megadeth has put out since Rust in Peace.  Having Chris Polland back on guitar gave the music that frantic energy Megadeth had back in the day.  Not to mention impecable musicianship that Megadeth sometime loses when Dave changes band mates so often.

Leto is interested in internal battles, progress of life (fitting for an actor, I guess)<br /><br />- More variety between and within songs (tempo, topics) than the first album<br /><br />- Some catchy hook songs like From Yesterday and Attack<br /><br />- Less noise and more music<br /><br />The bad<br /><br />- Verges on pretentious at times<br /><br />- There's still no guitarist capable of a good lead to sustain the songs - sometimes songs just feel incomplete<br /><br />- Jared's vocals are still somewhat marginal, not really skilled, rather just enthusiastic<br /><br />- Doesn't have quite the intensity of the first album<br /><br />Somehow I found this a bit forgettable - there was nothing I disliked, and some good songs, but I only listened to it a couple of times.<br /><br />Incidentally - I really like the \\"addon\\" track Hunter as it is quite different from the rest - more mellow, quietly intense - and Leto doesnt do any screaming in it ;) Battle of One is also OK.
0895260131|5.0|Personally, after many books on Islam I've looked at, skimmed, or read, this is probably the easiest one to understand and the most straightforward about what Islam really is and is all about.  It pulls no punches and explains why we see what we see, and lets history (and not propaganda) and their own works tell the truth about what Islam is (even if we don't want to believe it). <br /> <br />Furthermore, as a teacher I believe that, if I was to teach on Islam, this would be the book I would choose because the short sections (4 pages maximum from all I can tell) make it an easy book to tell students to read in smaller bites, and easier for them to read in smaller bites when larger amounts of reading is given.  It is a good general introduction that is detailed enough to be clearly not a propaganda piece and yet short enough that you aren't going to be slaving away at endless pages on one particular aspect of Islam. <br /> <br />I think that I should here mention that probably the most honest and regularly relevant source of information on present day Islam is MEMRI, which translated stuff from Arabic into English and really is a service that would be hard to called a propaganda machine no matter your view on this subject. <br /> <br />Also, I would recommend that if you are wanting a much stronger and autobiographical viewpoint of this subject that from that of someone who grew up in the midst of all this and saw the terrorists (well, maybe better put: jihadists) take over, read \\"Because They Hate\\" by Brigitte Gabriel, and check out her organization The National Congress for Truth.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|It's a little diffrent from their other CDs and at first wasn't too impressed. But after listening to it a few times it really starts to grow on you.  I love every song.
B000NVIGC0|2.0|I like my \\"coming out of rehab\\" records a little more \\"Scary Monsters.\\" My initial impression is that \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" sounds domestic. It reminds me a lot of Neil Young's \\"Harvest Moon\\" in tone and subject matter, only it's less wistful and more self-pitying. It sounds very 70s--plaintive, finger-picked acoustic guitars; gentle piano on almost every song; some vocal harmonies; a few quiet string arrangements. Another title it resembles is Beck's \\"Sea Change,\\" but it's even more understated.     <br /> <br />This is a straight-ahead work in every way. Even the album's very brief breaks into rock territory are firmly in a Neil Young mold (think \\"Heart of Gold\\" with a couple bars of the guitar solo from \\"Down By the River\\"). I will give Wilco credit for constantly switching it up though; this sounds almost nothing like \\"ghost.\\" In fact, enough songs have a country flavor that it sounds like it \\"should have\\" come out after \\"Being There.\\"  <br /> <br />Nels Cline is all over this record, lending a jazz fusion kind of vibe on a couple tracks. It works. Jeff tries to channel his inner Van Morrison on a couple songs (less successfully). Nels is pretty much the only surprise musically--unless, of course, the apparent simplicity is the surprise.   <br /> <br />It's the kind of a record that would have great resonance if I were feeling depressed. As I listen now, the lyrics sound painfully direct, almost corny. On past titles, Tweedy lyrics would have been more literary. I'm not sure if he intentionally employs overused, obvious metaphors this time. I'm waiting for the punchline, but I don't think it's coming.  <br /> <br />I will say that my opinion of Wilco titles tends to change over time. I may experience some kind of epiphany where I think \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" is better than a John Denver record, but right now I think it sounds an awful lot like a John Denver record.  <br />
B000OCXMAE|1.0|it is a major departure from their earlier work so much so that it should not be called linkin park. if they did not release \\"what i've done\\" as the first single the cd would not sell; it is the only remotely LP sounding song on the cd. There are a few tracks that are unlistenable, including one where Shinoda sings, Oh god his voice is awful.
0307346609|4.0|The Premise: A contagion turns people into flesh-eating zombies, killing and reanimating them and the only way to kill them is to destroy the brain.<br /><br />The execution is like a lesson in how to thoroughly explore that theme.  Admittedly the premise is over the top, but Max Brooks approaches the consequences and ramifications with great care and seriousness.  He starts by setting the stage by explaining what the world is like now and then he traces the initial source of the virus to China and explains through a series of interviews how it took over the African subcontinent, earning the name Jungle Fever.  Brooks draws parallels to the Aids outbreak and epidemic by the Western reaction of denial and profiteering to this new infection.<br /><br />In fact, interviews are the core of the book . . . it's told as a series of interviews with survivors and their recollections of what it was like in those horrible times, learning to cope with the outbreak, escaping and eventually fighting with the final part being the aftermath - how the planet changed.  Each interview is with a different person, from the Chinese doctor who identified patient zero to the vice president of the United States.<br /><br />Each interview involves circumstances and reactions that are completely believable given the unbelievability of the initial premise - from the reality-based broadcast from inside a protected compound of celebrities who all behave badly to the actual battle tactics that ended up being successful against the zombies.<br /><br />I would have to say this is the best zombie book I've read.<br /><br /> - CV Rick
0689865384|2.0|It took me quite a while to get around to reading this book, because it wasn't of great interest to me and when I did finally read it, I'm sorry to say, it didn't blow me away. In fact, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Things people said were ridiculously old and there is a poor attempt at romance. I liked the Midnighter's trilogy, but I gotta say, this wasn't good. I could see younger kids reading this (preteens) but I definatley don't consider it a teenaged book.
0312360266|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Other reviewers hit the nail on the head, though I see it more like Harry Potter meets Blue Bloods and Daughters of the Moon.  Zoey Redbird WAS an average teenage girl just trying to fit in and handle her not so wonderful home-life, until she is \\"marked\\" as a vampyre.  This means she has to leave her best friend, boyfriend and family to attend a Vampyre boarding school.  It is here that just when she feels like things are falling into place and she's fitting in she finds that there is a very dark side to all of it as well.  The Cast girls combine mythology, vamps and witchcraft together with the normal everyday worries of every teenager.  I also liked their view on cats, that you don't choose them, they choose you.  I can't wait to see where the story goes in the next book!! I do have to include that I would not reccommend it to readers who are on the younger side of Potter for content reasons.  Otherwise, read and enjoy!!!
0375830995|5.0|Very very good. It was thought provoking and serious but very funny. There was humor in serious things and beauty in sadness. Different from a lot of teen books out there. Totally recomend it.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Hey stupid, first of all dont be mad because u didnt get to see this movie when you were a kid! This movie is nothin less than a 5 star! Be real son your how old in 2007 and you just seen this movie? IT WAS MADE IN 1985 relax..anyways...Best movie ever made..well that and karate kid 1.
B00000AFHM|5.0|I have heard this album a hundred times but I always come back.  It's one of their best albums and great by any measure.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Must be 40 yr olds that think animal house is some devine movie, The younger generation such as I(28)know that Old School is waaaaaaayyyyy better! no contest. i've seen both and I personally Think your a dumbass to think animal house even compares to old school, and someone should take your keyboard away and ban you from amazon! Later Losers.
B00000JHAU|3.0|I gave this only 3 stars not because it's not good but because it doesn't come close to some of their better albums.  If your a big fan go ahead and get this CD but otherwise pass and get a better Belle and Sebastian album.
B000OCZ0ZO|5.0|I'll echo the sentiments above that this album is definitely a change of pace from their earlier material.  I'm surprised at how many good ratings there were though...I thought some people would be disappointed and mark it down because it is so different.  Some people may still be disappointed, but they're keeping quiet based on past loyalty to the band.  It's hard not to listen to this with expectations based on their past songs, and for that reason, I would urge anyone who gets this to listen to it a few times before figuring what songs you want to add to your playlists and which songs you like.  After the first go, I only had one song marked for my favorites playlist.  I set my computer to repeat the whole CD, and listened to it about four times.  Then I decided I liked about 10 of the songs on the CD after I'd heard it for awhile.<br /><br />This is an album that will quickly grow on you if you're only lukewarm on it after your first listening.<br /><br />I've seen several lyrics sites that mention an additional song called \\"Hold Nothing Back\\" that is listed on this album, but I can't find a mention of it on any version that Amazon sells.  I got the bonus version with the MVI disc, not on there.  What's up with that?  Where is this song  found?
1582701709|2.0|I looked forward with anticipation to \\"The Secret.\\"  The cover art work is clever, and eye-catching.  It is a carefully crafted work designed to create a sense that great wisdom of the ages is about to be imparted.  But I think that reviewer C.P. may have been the most articulate in his \\"the emperor has no clothes\\" review when he said that the only secret here was all the money Rhonda Byrne was taking to the bank.  I hate to violate the \\"Thumper Rule(when you don't have nothing nice to say, don't say nothing at all.),\\"  but this book's message could have been written on one page.  A far better book is Dawson Church's \\"The Genie in your Genes\\" which actually explains the scientific basis of a positive attitude and how to harness it to your life.  I think there is great value in a positve approach to anything one does in life.  But I won't violate the Thumper Rule anymore in an analysis of this book because that would be negative.<br /><br />Pierce Scranton M.D.<br /><br />author, Death on the Learning Curve
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I knew going into this album that Linkin Park was changing up their sound. I mean I guess they got sick of people thinking they were some amateur nu-metal band. I personally loved every single track of their first two albums and think Reanimation is a work of art.  <br /> <br />So I am very conflicted in writing this review. First off I'm not one of those people who wants to piss and moan about how they aren't as heavy as their previous albums. I listen to all forms of music and am really accepting of various styles. I went into listening to this CD with a relatively open mind. <br /> <br />The Good: <br />- The first time the band has really had some emotion in their work. Their previous work although great wasn't very emotionally involving. This CD changes that. <br /> <br />- Most of the CD is just flat out beautiful when it wants to be, and heavy when it wants to be. <br /> <br />- Bleed it Out is easily IMO the most addictive song they have EVER made.  <br /> <br />The Bad:  <br />- Hands Held High. This track is a real dud. Not because of its political message, I'm pro free speech and all that. It's the fact that the almost gospel style to the song is so cheesy and making it sound like what he is saying is \\"Holy\\" is just horrendously pretentious. <br /> <br />- It's been 4 years since the last CD. The buzz coming from the interviews (at least as far as I interpreted them) was that this was a concept album...like an end of the world album. I wasn't expecting something like \\"Year Zero\\" from NIN. But I expected a CD that was a bit more cohesive. This seems more like a lot of experimental tracks. <br /> <br />- Mike is barley on this thing. It's Chester heavy. Nuff said. <br /> <br />- With so many slower ballad-like tracks the more 4 real active tracks (Given Up, Bleed it Out, What I've Done, No More Sorrow) stick out like sore thumbs and become almost dominant attention grabbing tracks. I have a hard time remembering the other tracks on the CD. The album just needs more variety overall.  <br /> <br />I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 3 because although this album has some flaws, all of it sounds good (even if its not as unique as their older work) and over time the album will grow on me.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Director Clint Eastwood has followed up his highly successful \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" with a film that looks at the Battle of Iwo Jima entirely from the Japanese perspective.  In that vein, \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" gives the viewer an entirely new look at the battle, and perhaps a new perspective of the Japanese soldiers who were defending the island. <br /> <br />Ken Watanabe stars as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi.  He was put in charge of formulating a defense of Iwo Jima.  Kuribayashi was not the typical Japanese General.  He worried greatly about the well-being of his family and the men under his command.  He refused to eat special rations; rather, he insisted on eating the same food as the soldiers.  He routinely made inspections on foot rather than from a vehicle.  And, perhaps most importantly, he didn't abide by the Japanese bushido code.  Upon taking command, he set about re-formulating Iwo's defenses from a beachhead defense to a complex system of tunnels and caves.  These would prove most difficult for the Americans to break.   <br /> <br />Kazunasi Ninomiya stars as Saigo, a young Japanese soldier who is part of Iwo's garrison.  He was told at his home that he was drafted into the army.  This news greatly disturbed his wife, who was pregnant at the time of Saigo's induction.  He worked as a baker before being drafted, and he had several run-ins with the Japanese secret police.  Now, realizing that the war is hopelessly lost, he longs to be back with his family.   <br /> <br />As the movie goes along, the American invasion draws nearer.  The Japanese fortifications are strong, and on D-Day, the Americans suffer many casualties due to Kuribayashi's defenses.  However, it is soon clear to the Japanese that the battle cannot be won.  Many men commit suicued by blowing themselves up with grenades rather than surrender.  Saigo and another Japanese soldier even decide to surrender rather than commit suicide or die of starvation, but the attempt is foiled.  Saigo's friend manages to surrender, but Saigo is caught and taken back to his unit.  His friend is eventually shot by two American soldiers who don't want to watch over him. <br /> <br />In the end, Kuribayashi leads an attack against the American positions, only to be severely injured by shrapnel.  As he lay dying, he pulls out his pearl-handled pistol, a gift from friends in the United States, and shoots himself.  Saigo, who was told by Kuribayashi to bury him, is eventually captured by the Americans, but he ended up surviving the battle. <br /> <br />This is a fantastic movie.  Clint Eastwood has went a step beyond \\"Flags\\" with this movie.  Although I liked \\"Flags\\" very much, I enjoyed \\"Letters\\" more.  Ken Watanabe delivers an Oscar-caliber performance as Kuribayashi, while Ninomiya's portrayal of Saigo is just as good.  The battle scenes are very realistic, and it is sobering to see that many of the Japanese soldiers were not evil killing machines; on the contrary, they were very much like the Americans; scared and missing their homes and loved ones. <br /> <br />I give this film my highest recommendation.  Clint Eastwood has crafted a masterpiece that is sure to become a classic.
0375831002|5.0|The Book Thief is an astonishing tale. I'm not going to spoil the plot for you, but I will tell you it's an incredible read. I think Zusak was brilliant in deciding that Death should narrate this story. That was one of the reasons why I liked it so much. His descriptions and phrases were awesome, one of my favorites being \\"a breakfast-colored sun.\\" Part Ten brought me to tears, it was so moving. Excellent all over!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|What can I say? For me it's enough that it's a \\"new\\" Beatles release with some very interesting changes and sound effects that were not available when the original songs were done. I love it. There's only one song I don't like the changes on. The rest are fabulous and there is plenty of songs to listen to. A+
B000A6T262|5.0|The set has great special features and interviews that I had missed on the previous versions of the movies.  I loved it!  The set is well worth it, even if you have the original movies.
0770430074|5.0|Of course, there is far more to this book than just those three elements.  Piscine (Pi) Patel, God-loving religious philanderer, son of a zookeeper comes of age when he loses his family in a tragic shipwreck.  A boy becomes a man in just 270+ days at sea...on a liferaft...with a 450 lb Bengal tiger...and yet always with God.  He comes to terms with a tiger, his own mortality, and the name he has been saddled with...a name he despises because it sounds like \\"PISS-ING\\".  The prose is magical, memorable.  The story is a roller coaster of doubt, survival and elation.  My copy of this book is dog-earred and underlined and I find myself thinking about the story in the middle of the day as I go about my work -- even though I finished the last chapter a week ago.  Martell has written a magnum opus that will be enjoyed by many genrations, for decades, if not centuries, to come.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|I think Will Smith and his son did and excellent job of portaying the main people in this movie.
B000NA2776|5.0|This is the first CD that has MADE me like every last one of its songs during the first listen. Typically I have to get used to all of the other songs, besides the favorite that I purchased the CD for. These songs are all so catchy and fun and Mika is an absolutely adorable person! The message that he puts across in some of his songs is admirable as well. <br />His talent is evident and his originality and creativity is a much needed breath of fresh air. I'm taking a deep breath right now, and I love it.  <br />My only worry? I just might get sick of these songs because I listen to them so often!
B000MZHW40|3.0|I liked the plot,it was one of those I would watch once and enjoy but twice no.
B000K7VHJQ|1.0|Roger Ebert, whom I respect, gave this film a good review when it was released, and I went to see it based on his recomendation.<br /><br />Well, I've disagreed with him before.<br /><br />Nothing in this movie explains what Christ was about. Nothing about the Sermon on the Mount, nothing about what he taught at all. It was all about how he died a gruesome death, an obsession that Gibson puts above everything else.<br /><br />I noticed in the negative reviews of \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" that many reviewers expressed enthusiasm for Gibson's film, but hated Scorsese's, which I found a moving examination of what it must have been like for Christ to struggle between the human and divine sides of his nature. (An account based not on the Gospels, as many believed, but upon a thoughtful writer's imagination.) How, after all, can Christ be an inspiring example if he was never tempted by the things all men and women are tempted by?<br /><br />The \\"Passion\\" is perverse.<br /><br />(Just returned to this review and tried to take out all the extra spaces -- hope it worked.)
1582701709|5.0|The information in this book and DVD could easily be hidden from people in plain view. The Law of Attraction is so simple - in a diverse way - that you could tell people about it - but they probably wouldn't believe it - understand it- or practice it. Those who do - get it. I mean that in a literal sense as well. <br />I loved the film but it is easier to follow in the book - I'd suggest you buy both because the information comes so fast in the film you don't have time to digest one thing before the next thought is presented.
B0006B3UEQ|5.0|This movie proves Tom Cruise is an actor par excellence.    Forget about Hollywood [...] like Top Gun - Cruise is a serious and remarkably talented actor. I was absolutely glued to the screen watching this movie; Cruise created an \\"air\\" and \\"presence\\" that was simply electrifying. *Note* The way Cruise \\"moves\\" through the crowded nightclub to acquire his target you would think He was the only person in the room.     Collateral is a stunning movie, a psychological/action thriller without compare.     Unfortunately, Collateral has never received the credit it truly deserves - it will, I have no doubt, become a classic.    I gave this movie five stars; I wish I could give it six.
1582701709|5.0|I love this book!  I used to be an unemployed high school dropout living with my parents.  Now, I'm a bazillionaire!  I read this book, made a wish, and a giant box of money fell out of the sky and landed on my mother (God rest her soul) and now my problems are over.  It is truly amazing that one book could change your life so completely, but there you are.  Buy this book and read it and wish for money (tell your mom to stay indoors) and you to can live the life you really deserve.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Very emotional piece of art here.  The Way The Wind Blows had me actually crying.  I've never felt that way about any Rush song before (perhaps Secret Touch but not as strong).  The Larger Bowl is both moving and catchy at the same time - unusual combination which works well here.  Spindrift is dark and powerful, and Good News First resonates with mixed feelings.  Rush successfully connects with anyone doing the same thing a bit too long with the personal and universal, We Hold On.  Although the music is very interesting, with 3 good instrumentals, and powerful waltzes, I found myself paying more attention to the songs as a whole due to the strong feelings they invoke. <br /> <br />I've listened to it several times and it's become continuously more engaging. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a very, very, very good set of DVDs on nature to have. There is a lot of information to learn from and it certaily bring one to the attention of Global warming. I have learned to appreciate this planet that we live in Planet EARTH. I highly recommend it!
B000P0J02E|5.0|I'm a long-time fan of Hans Zimmer. Needless to say I have been waiting with anticipation for this soundtrack after hearing previews and clips a couple weeks ago.    I believe that some people who were really in love with the first soundtrack's lightheartedness and hijinks may find this one a bit of a disappointment (and perhaps maybe not). While many of the old themes are used in the span of the entire CD, they are relied upon far less than the previous two, with the obvious exception of Jack's theme. We do, however, hear the old themes, but in different ways. Davy Jones' theme is indeed played on a music box in \\"At Wit's End\\" but then it shifts into a moving symphonic rendition. And the East India Trading Company theme, or Beckett's Theme, is given a new feel from the original dulcimer- an electric guitar (\\"Parley\\").    It is very epic- as is Hans Zimmer's way, I could hear cues from such movies as The da Vinci Code, King Arthur, and even a tone or two that reminded me of Gladiator. Regardless, this CD definitely has its own feel- there are parts of it that sound vast and whimsical, upbeat and playful, romantic and lighthearted, creepy and dank, and of course, silly and drunk, as is most noticeable in \\"Multiple Jacks.\\"    The new romantic theme, which is introduced in \\"At Wit's End,\\" is beautiful and flowing. In fact, it seems a bit surprising on this particular soundtrack, given the feel of the other two soundtracks. It has an ethereal flair to it, and is very orchestral and full.    However, I am loathe to compare this to the other two because of the fact, mainly, that the movie has not officially been released yet, and it's obviously an entirely seperate movie. I can already imagine the scenes in which these songs appear, but I also don't want to get a set image in my head to ruin the anticipation of the movie.    A refreshing and interesting addition, perhaps most of all, is the new pirate shanty (or \\"dirge,\\" as it were), \\"Hoist The Colours.\\" It is a short song, relying on drums, that begins with a lone child singing rather hesitantly, then the chorus grows as other pirates (I assume- what else would they be?) join in. This basic, and primary, theme is repeated several times throughout the soundtrack, usually at the climatic points of the songs. Along with this song, the Asian influences in the song \\"Singapore\\" (and others) offer a new touch of worldliness to this soundtrack, something that was not utilized before.    Every song on this CD is wonderful. My personal favorites are \\"Drink Up Me Hearties,\\" \\"At Wit's End,\\" and \\"I Don't Think Now Is The Best Time\\" because these three, in my own opinion, are incredibly dauntless.    The release of this SUPERB soundtrack only makes it worse to wait another 2 days for the movie. :)
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I am a huge LP fan and have been anticipating the release of this album since Meteora came out.  Needless to say, I was a little disappointed when I listened to the album and felt (in many songs) that I was not even listening to Linkin Park.  I don't think that it's a bad album, I actually do like the songs and the lyrics -- but most of them are songs I could hear from any rock group out there.  The thing I loved the most about LP was that they were different from other groups.  They mixed rock and rap in a way that made them unique.  There is very little of that on this album.  They have replaced that style with a barrage of ballads and what sounds like a song lifted from the Fort Minor album and dropped onto this one (Hands Held High). I think the heavier songs on the album (Given Up, Bleed it Out, What I've Done, and No More Sorrow) are great but they left me wanting more.   <br /> <br />It's good for a band to mature and make some changes, but I feel like they've lost the essence of who they are.  When I compare songs like Faint and One Step Closer to the songs on this album, I feel like something is definitely missing.
B00005JLWN|5.0|The trailers for EQUILIBRIUM kick a**. Guns, explosions, Matrix-style shots, a futuristic world, Taye Diggs and Christian friggin' Bale. But while the trailer looked attractive, it's well-known that many a polished trailer has masked a giant turd of a movie. I was willing to take that chance, however, and picked up this flick one night to see if it had the goods.<br /><br />The result? One h*ll of an action flick, that's what!<br /><br />It's not enough that EQUILIBRIUM was rife with things that went BOOM. The fact that it fused action with martial arts made it that much cooler, much like what the Matrix did by melding martial arts and cyberpunk. From there, it held me on the edge of my sofa with a suspenseful man-versus-Big Brother plot wrapped inside the bigger theme of feelings and emotions and how mankind would be nothing without them. Bale's character misses a dose of his emotion-numbing medication one day and--bada-bing--the tide of revolt against Big Brother has turned.<br /><br />And the ending didn't disappoint, although it was a bit easier for Bale to save the world than I thought it should be. There was also A LOT of dummy dialogue that was used to bring the audience up to speed on the backstory. Very clumsy and awkward. The biggest complaint, however, focuses on the irony of many of the bad guys getting angry at Bale and the freedom fighters. In a world where emotion is a criminal offense, why doesn't anyone take them in?<br /><br />Now I'm not saying EQUILIBRIUM is a great movie in strictly cinematic terms. It's imperfect and flawed. But in terms of an action picture? Rarely does it get better than this. If you like your action fast, explosive, and hardcore, do yourself a favor and rent EQUILIBRIUM.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Well im sure myself, and other LOST fans will be glad to know, as I'm sure any true Lostie keeps up with recent news, but I caught \\"Kate's\\" interview with Regis & Kelly and she confirmed they've been picked up for another three years.  Some of this season was slow, while other episodes were that wonderful edge of your seat watching that makes us realize this really is a great, unpredicitable show where anything can happen.  I'm looking forward to the Season Finale tomorrow night, will miss the 6 Month break I hear is looming, new episodes won't start again until January, but that will also enable us to have back to back new episodes next year.  For those of you who haven't caught on to LOST yet, you've got time now, pick up a copy of this great DVD, or borrow a friends first, if you do I guarantee you'll want your own.
B000LXHK22|5.0|Great for date night.<br /><br />A man who lost his way in the world of business finds out there is more to life than work. It could have been a little deeper but still a good film on its own.
B000NVIGC0|3.0|Say what you want about Jay, he was a headache and a half, he was insecure, he was annoying, etc. but that man was a crucial part of the chemical formula that resulted in fantastic Wilco albums.  <br /> <br />Sure these are good musicians, and the writing is good...but the components are no longer there to produce a timeless work of genius, or the next all american classic. Hopefully for the next Wilco album there are some new players involved.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I wanted to go to this concert in the worst way when it was announced. Why it took so long to see the DVD I don't know. This was by far the best concert video I have ever seen!  <br />  <br />The Indian Orchestra which starts the show was amazing. Monty Python was, well, Monty Python. I loved it! <br />  <br />Eric Clapton was the only choice for musical director for this event. The songs they chose and the musicians chosen to do the leads were perfect! The arrangement of Something is worth owning the DVD alone. <br />  <br />Even if you're a casual George Harrison fan, this is a must have for your collection! <br />
B00030590I|5.0|The film takes place 2,000 years ago when China was split into seven feudal kingdoms. The tyrannical but shrewd and insightful King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) who wants to unite seven kingdoms in one powerful country, is the target of three legendary assassins: Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung), accompanied by Moon (Zhang Ziyi), his devoted servant. The titular Hero, the man without the name (Jet Li), who defeated the assassins, receives as an award a unique private audience with the King of Qin in his Royal Palace...<br /><br />I believe that this is an amazing film which has everything working perfectly: great story which is told in the manner of Kurosawa's Rashômon, romance, action (and what the action it is...), political intrigue, suspense, fantasy - and if this is not enough, 'Hero' is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen - Christopher Doyle's cinematography, jaw - dropping use of colors, costume design, Tan Dun's musical score, and artfully choreographed fighting sequences leave you breathless.

B00005YJMX|4.0|Fifty seven years after F.W. Murnau, Herzog resurrected the Dracula's legend with this film in which his favorite actor/best friend/worst enemy Klaus Kinski played the title role as a very tired, very quiet, very lonely Count Dracula who looked like he literally had not slept for centuries. The film is undeniably Herzog's and has many of his signature signs - the stunning views, the slow deliberate pace, the eerie music, the dreamlike atmosphere, the admiration by the nature and its indifferent to the humans' worries power and remote beauty; even the story of the ship with all crew members dead as the result of the horrible mystery. Breathtakingly beautiful Isabelle Adjani plays an object of Dracula's obsession and the contrast between his ugliness and her divine beauty is simply mesmerizing. In this film, the pure-hearted and brave woman takes it upon herself to face off the undead evil. By the time, Dr. Van Helsing arrives with the stake and hammer, his services are not required.
B00009XITQ|5.0|movie is brilliant. Colin firth and amanda bynes are very funny. Oliver james is amazing as an actor and singer. the film as well as the soundtrack are well worth having in any collection
0060887303|5.0|I did enjoy this book- very much. It's more grown-up than anything. The story arc is extending through the series. I can't wait to see what happens to the girls. Sara Sheperd has created an entire world of Rosewood, PA. The characters flow very well.<br /><br />Each girl has a secret she's trying desperately to hide, and somebody named A seems to know about all about each of them. There's a high level of disfunction in each girl's family. Emily's real problem is parents who don't accept her very well and are trying to force her into mold of who they want her to be. If they did, I think her sexual idenity issues would be a lot easier to handle. Then, there's Aria- she's got the weight of the world on her shoulders- her true story arc is that she's covering up for an ugly family secret that could tear her family apart. Hanna is probably the most self-destructive of all the girls in the book- she's a klepto and she's eating disordered- and despite getting caught, her mother doesn't deal with it like a normal mother should, and tries to get her off the hook instead of making her deal with it. Plus, Hanna's single father has replaced her, sending her sense of self-esteem spiralling down, affecting all the relationships in her life. Spencer's hot-and-heavy affair with her sister's boyfriend turns ugly when it gets exposed to her family. They come down on her, instead of Wren for taking advantage of her (he must be, like 23!!!), and side with her sister. That storyline broke my heart. Spencer wasn't really a bad girl- just trying too hard to be perfect and her parents didn't appreciate that.<br /><br />The biggest secret they're all keeping is The Jenna Thing. What is The Jenna Thing? Well, you'll just have to read Flawless to fidn out!!
B000NVIXDW|1.0|There are better singers that sing standards out there now that have a better voice then him. I guess middle age house wife's like it. I laugh at the people that call this jazz. Just becasue it has horns does not make it Jazz. Jazz is Billie Holiday, Miles Davis not some dude who sings old stardards just because he is too dam cheap to get songs that are more current to sing. Did you see him on American Idol a month ago he gave a very bad performance Sanjaya could have showed a thing or two. Would it hurt this guy to learn to play a instrument like a guitar and write his own songs.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|It isn't a short film but it goes by like the wind, and some of the movie's speed has to be credited to Mr On Again Off Again Martin Campbell, the director who has made some of the best action flicks ever, as well as some of the worst.  He must have wanted to put his best foot forward here and show Matthew Vaughan or whoever that there's life in the old dog yet.  But this baby races.  The long card game in Montenegro, that apparently lasts nearly 24 hours (with breaks for sex and murder), is briskly staged and comes studded with its own surprises, including the \\"reveal\\" about who Jeffrey Wright is supposed to be playing!  He seemed more than ordinarily interested in Daniel Craig from the beginning, but I thought he was supposed to be an aesthetic Hilton Als type, drawn to beauty like a moth drawn towarda a flame, and then you find out---<br /><br />(SPOILERS ENSUE)<br /><br />He's Felix Leiter, Bond's soon to be BFF!  Hats off to EON for casting such a great actor in what doesn't come to much here, but if he is kept will eventually bloom into a honey of a part.  It's like having Veruschka in the casino.  They don't have to make a great deal of it, they've got so much front line talent that great faces can just appear and disappear, alluring shadows.  What Eisenstein called the Cinema of Attractions.<br /><br />I thought it was a little over the top when Le Chiffre tore the entire cane seat out of the chair when it was time to torture Bond's underparts.  That was a huge hole and any other man would have fallen right through.  The hole ideally should have been somewhat less than the entire breadth of the chair seat?  And when Craig is strapped into it he seems to be perched as though there were no hole at all.  That's how great his body is, I assume.<br /><br />OK, should the producers have hired Eva Green when they had the chance to cast Angelina Jolie as Vesper Lynd?  Maybe Jolie was asking too much.  Or maybe the idea was that, everyone would know that Vesper had a dark side if you had AJ playing the part right from the start?  Maybe that's so, but it takes a while to get used to Eva Green and when Bond orders to look luscious for the casino scene, and she comes down in Morticia Addams' old hair and makeup, I knew right away she had sabotage in mind.<br /><br />{SPOILERS END.)<br /><br />All in all, a great shakeup for a beloved series.  Too bad it had to be PG-13 contractually, an R rated CASINO ROYALE would at least have ensured that Bond and Solange would have done the deed?the part right from the start?

B000002LK1|5.0|I can't get enough of this album (personal favorite since it was released) and listen to it everyday in my car! \\"Enjoy the Silence\\", \\"World in My Eyes\\", and \\"Policy of Truth\\" get me through morning and evening traffic. This is one disk I can't bring myself to eject. Every track is a favorite, but can't seem to get enough of the eerie, hypnotic, and sexy \\"Blue Dress\\"; the beat in that song is irresistible!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|While broadcast networks are pulling idiotic stunts like sticking good shows such as Jericho on months-long \\"hiatus\\" (for maximum impact in the outdated, outmoded, highly inaccurate A.C. Neilsen ratings system), and then acting surprised when the ratings upon its return are not as strong (and then canceling the show, rather than blaming their own idiot decision-making), cable channels like Showtime are making quality shows and (how's this for novel, networks?) actually PUTTING THEM ON THE AIR FOR PEOPLE TO SEE.<br /><br />The results speak for themselves. Dexter is a marvel, improving even upon the Jeff Lindsay novel on which it's based; and, whaddaya know? It's gonna be back next season (long about the time the laser in my DVD player burns a hole in this set from repeated viewing).
0895260131|1.0|This book is a right-wing fantastical conflation of radicalized and mainstream Islam. It's utter trash, presented as some grand \\"de-bunking\\" and  \\"de-mystifying\\" but it's pushing a political agenda of hatred against Muslims and people who don't want to kill/convert them. I'm appalled that, as a scholar of the Middle East, this book even came up on my \\"recommended\\" list. Don't buy this piece of garbage; there's a reason this book purports to tell you \\"the real truth\\" behind Islam that 99% of other books WON'T tell you--it's because that other 99% gets it RIGHT.
B000002KKS|5.0|Tony Iommi plays great on this album. It was the last album before he changed his tone & style to now using a wah wah on every solo... to bad.<br /><br />Drummer Bill Ward finally has a big bass drum sound & Geezer Butler plays  bass excellent as always.<br /><br />Thanks to Martin Birch for his excellent production in capturing this inspired band. Ronnie James Dio sings excellent as well.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Very different from past Linkin Parks...I dont like there swearing on this cd.  It was nice on there past ones not to worry about playing in front of the kids.  The song Hands Held High really stands out.  I dont agree or like there knocking the Presidnet but it is a good song.
B000002KDO|5.0|This Album is such a MasterPiece, the writing & doomy riffs of Tony Iommi, to the odd timing of Bill Wards classic Heavy Metal drum style.<br /><br />This album will go down in history as the Bible of Heavy Metal.<br /><br />Ozzy sings excellent & Geezer Butlers uncanny ability to wrap his bass lines around Tonys Crushing chords. Every Song rocks.<br /><br />Many dont know this album features Bill Wards 1st song he sang on.<br /><br />Today with  remastered technology the production is excellent.<br /><br />This album taught me how to play guitar.
B000P2A256|5.0|After waiting so long for this album to come out, I am truly delighted. I loved 'Songs about Jane' but found it to be kinda boring in the end. This cd isnt boring and I could listen to the first 4 tracks continuously for hours on end... this is a solid outing for a great band... it's a must buy for any true maroon 5 fan... dont listen to the other 'huge' fans that bomb the album saying it is a discs full of remixes or is totally uninspired....
B000MQ54OO|5.0|Pixar movies are in my opinion the best overall movies being made these days, and this one is just as good. The animation, audio, voice overs, cinematography, story are great. A powerful film, for sure. I hope children (and adults) everywhere have a chance to see it.
B000A7S4B0|1.0|Bummer, dude. These songs sound like pale rip-offs of \\"Brian Jonestown Massacre.\\" Why listen to this album when you can hear the real thing elsewhere? Black Rebel Motorcycle Club sounds like Charlatans UK without the Hammond organ, or the talent and songwriting ability. Only buy this album if you find it in the discount bin for $0.99. It's easily forgettable.

1591841666|3.0|The Dip, by Seth Godin, is a very small book (80 pages) that says, in short:<br /><br />-  Winners quit (regroup. cut their losses, switch gears) whenever necessary on the path to winning.<br /><br />-  Be the best, and the world comes knocking at your door.<br /><br />-  Work through the pain, because the reward is waiting for you further down the road.<br /><br />If any of these comments/suggestions seem unclear, take at look at The Dip.<br /><br />If you understand already, you've just saved $12.95.<br /><br />This is not a \\"how-to\\" book.  It is meant to be a motivational piece of writing.  Work hard... the financial rewards are greatest for the hardest worker.  Work through \\"the dip,\\" or that period where the gains don't seem to be coming as quickly as you'd like.  Don't stop running the marathon at mile 25.<br /><br />Look, the very successful don't read these books.  The barely successful can't read these books.  So it is written for the somewhat successful, or the person who is looking for \\"something\\" else.  Here's the shortened version:  \\"Work and study hard.  Don't give up. Persevere.  However, consider alternatives.  Share this book with others.\\"<br /><br />Don't get me wrong... this is not, in any sense, a bad book, or a book giving bad advice.  To me, the advice seems pretty obvious.<br /><br />Work hard, play hard, and be well.
B000007WNN|5.0|If you want ROCK OUT like there is no tommorw put this awesome album on and crank it up.
1401307450|3.0|To be honest: Red Hot Chili Peppers were always kind of a hit-and-miss band to me. For every great song such as Under the Bridge or Otherside, you have records with quite a few fillers, underdeveloped songs or just way too many (Stadium Arcadium for sure is here). Delving into an autobiography of singer Anthony Kiedis would seem a strange thing since I'm not that big a fan although I do enjoy a track or 4. There's some interesting tidbits and insights yet there's other parts that are just hard to like by how repetitive it feels or his odd judgment. <br /> <br />The book is basically a huge look into how Kiedis became the frontman for the band. With sections detailing how his young life was filled with parties, drugs and women which continued as he formed friendships with Michael Balzary (Flea) and Hillel Slovak. The big topic here is drugs and the kicking of the habit and the relapses as well as the many relationships whether they were serious or just road ****s. We read how the recordings of albums were brought out, insights into songs as well as the news that Slovak overdosed and current guitarist John Frusciante's drug battles which rivaled and even exceeded Kiedis'. <br /> <br />One thing struck me is that it's actually a very accessible book to read. He writes like it's a conversation between the two of you, albeit one-sided and you never feel like he went into \\"author mode\\" and wanted to get all scholarly with his vocabulary. Although when describing music he does get into that repeated talk of the \\"magic, wonder, love etc\\" of making of music. Guy comes up with one bass riff and wow, what a magical song! No wonder Stadium Arcadium was so big, they didn't have the sense to chop out anything because they're all gold because they created them. Many though will get kind of tired of the constant drug use and the kicking the habit only to go back again. While it is the mindset of a druggie to use it as a fallback in case things get too crazy, we don't have to hear it all over and over. It's like copy and paste. <br /> <br />Of course the other thing I noticed is the large amount of women he's bedded. From more serious ones such as actress Ione Skye or Jaime Rishar to just encounters on the road such as a Kentucky woman, a Hawaiian one and whatnot, there's plenty of sex to go around. Problem is, as one reviewer pointed out, he does have a tendency to put onto people certain traits and qualities that all but excuse behaviors. Couple of girls, Claire or Jennifer let's say, are almost as destructive as he is and yet he just keeps at it (probably because of all-night sex/drug binges they had). At one point, he literally says he just doesn't love Rishar anymore yet you get the feeling these 2 were the better match. Then of course there's a whole thing with a Japanese girl that you'd best read for yourself. <br /> <br />For many RHCP fans, this is the book to read although you most likely will disagree or just plain get irritated by some of what he says. Now bring on the John Frusciante book; now that would be fascinating.

B000P2A256|5.0|This is really a solid album. If u loved \\"Songs about Jane\\"...you should like this one too! I still love Adam Levines voice and the way the lyrics are very sexy although they do tend to stay on the subject of heartache a bit much. My Favorite tracks include (2) makes me wonder...(5 & 6) \\"won't go home without you\\" and \\"nothing lasts forever\\"( hands down MY FAVORITE)... i hope this gets released as a single...you'll remember the chorus of this song as the hook in Kanye West's \\"heard e'm say\\"...I really like #11 too...\\"Better that we break\\"...i got a picture of a doomed relationship=\\"Baby we're better off this way\\"...it's really a sad song about how love crashes into life sometimes. This is a great follow up to what i considered a great first Maroon 5 album \\"Song's about Jane\\"...overall, Adams voice has more passion & is stronger and the lyrics are more grown up...they have grown as a band and seemingly kept the same sound...i can hear a lot of Adam Levines influences on this one too...as he again wrote or co-wrote the material for this album.  This is more full of an electronic sound at times and the music is much more forefront this time around with a lil' less dependance on Adam's voice...#12 is great too...it's a song that i can relate to...they didn't come out trying to sound like every other band now a days...i did wait for this album,like everyone else, for a while and i really love it, some of u may bash it for being a bit too polished but i don't agree. I love the sound and the lyrics,the whole retro feel is great for me! Not as good as \\"Songs About Jane\\" but i still really love this album.
0783240287|3.0|Make sure you read the Amazon Ediorial Review of this product before you buy it. This is not a typical stage production of this musical. Instead of filming a live stage production as it was performed, it was filmed more like a movie. This is not a negative part of my review, just one to be aware of. <br /> <br />Donny Osmond's does a fabulous job as Joseph, which is the main highlight of the DVD.  <br /> <br />I didn't rate it more than three stars for two main reasons. The sound quality is very poor, for one. However, my main complaint is risque Potiphar scene. I was warned beforehand and watched that scene before allowing my kids to. I'm glad I did, because I'd never want my kids to see that scene. The costumes the women wear make them look naked. I bought the DVD because my kids and I are doing this musical at our church and because I have always loved Joseph's story. Yet I'm saddened that Hollywood had to make something Biblical into something so risque that no child should ever see. Potiphar's wife did try to seduce Joseph, so I have no problem with telling that part of the story. It just doesn't have to be portrayed the way it was in this DVD.
8174460578|5.0|This book is barely more than 100 pages and took me only a few hours to read.  By the time I had finished it, the content of the book had completely changed my whole perspective on life, itself.  This book provides a very practical & plausible approach to achieving the goals that you have in life.  I'm 36 and over the years I've come to believe less in faith, God and the afterlife - coming to the dire conclusion that humans are just animals that invented heaven to provide us with a comforting illusion that we can survive death.  Few people on this planet could've been more cynical about life, spirituality and God than I was up until a six months ago.  This book, along with the following DVDs, books and website have completely changed my whole outlook on life, my happiness and my place within the grand scheme of the universe:               DVDs - The Secret                      Magical Egypt 5: ...the Afterlife               Books - Agless Mind, Timeless Body by Deepak Chopra                       Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill               website -[..]    All of these recommendations cost less than $100 together, but they will be the best $100 you have ever spent in your life!  After you've absorbed them all, you WILL believe in miracles, God, your spirit, and your ability to accomplish ANYTHING that you set out to do.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|This is a wonderful film. It's a story about a race horse who should not  have won, ridden by a jockey who should not have won, owned by a man who pulls himself out of grief by his devotion to the horse, the jockey, the trainer, and a second wife.<br /><br />The story starts with a man (Jeff Bridges) who moves to California and opens a bicycle shop. He is failing until he switches from bicycles to automobiles. He becomes a millionaire selling automobiles. He buys a ranch and uses the barn to store his car collection. After his son is killed in an auto accident, the cars are removed from the barn and taken away. His first wife never recovers from the death of their son, blames her husband, and leaves him.<br /><br />He meets a young beautiful woman who becomes his second wife. His wife loves horse racing. He decides to buy a horse. He searches for just the right trainer to pick out a horse for him. He finds the trainer, a taciturn man living by himself, camping in the wilderness. The trainer sees Seabiscuit on a track and tells the millionaire to buy him. He sees a certain spirit in the horse who has been mistreated all his life. There's a certain irony that a man who made his millions selling cars which replaced horses should buy and become devoted to a horse.<br /><br />Tobey Maguire's character was given away as a child to a horse trainer by his parents (virtually abandoned). He loves horses. For a time, he gets to race as a jockey but as he grows up he becomes too large to be a jockey and starves himself to keep his weight down. By the time he is hired by the millionaire to be the jockey for Seabiscuit, he is a broken down has-been jockey.<br /><br />Both the jockey and the horse have to be retrained out of the self-destuctive habits of a lifetime. Together, they become winners.<br /><br />All of the major characters associated with the horse Seabiscuit have suffered. They come together as a family of choice rather than one of blood and it is through their association with Seabiscuit and each other that they are each healed.<br /><br />Some people will not love this film for various reasons.

B000M53GQS|5.0|I like most people first heard Gerry Rafferty on the Stateside of the Pond when he was with Steelers Wheel, <br />I have always liked his basic use of Acoustic Guitar/Bass/Drums/Keyboards & Sax, as well as his double tracked vocals ,Gerry has a great sense of Harmony & Melody ,something that is sorely lacking in the Rock Music scene today .These are Gerry's first 2 Albums and are Dynamite well worth the purchase. Drummer Henri Spinnetti is on these disc's and he has done work with Paul McCartney and others .
B000060OFT|5.0|Let me begin my review by addressing those who are undecided whether to purchase this version (Luhrman) or the Zeffirelli.  There seems to be a bias amongst educators (bordering on the arrogant) that the Luhrman version is somehow less \\"authentic\\" than the Zeffirelli.  Simply performing \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" in doublet and hose, however, does not make it any more \\"Shakespearean\\".  In fact, I would argue that modern-dress is more in keeping with the spirit of the original as Elizabethan drama had no elaborate sets or costumes; doublet and hose WERE modern-dress in Shakespeare's time.  If we discount \\"updating\\" as a reason to discount the Luhrman version (which in my experience is invariably the excuse), we have to judge the movies on how well they illuminate/connect/inspire Shakespeare's words for our students.  In my opinion, the Luhrman version does a better job of this than the Zefferilli.<br /><br />First, the updating works (for the most part).  My students clearly understood gangs and rivalries; presenting the Montagues and Capulets as such, eliminated questions as why the two families hate each other or how the feud got started (answers which are outside the text).  The guns and cars appealed to the boys; the love and romance appealed to the girls.  My students could see themselves in the context Luhrman provided; they could relate to what was going on screen as present and relative, not merely events from 400 years ago.<br /><br />Secondly, casting famous actors (DiCaprio and Danes) as the leads hooks many of my students at the beginning.  They watch the movie BECAUSE Leonardo DiCaprio is in it, but soon the magic of the Bard's words (which they struggle to follow at first) keeps them interested.  DiCaprio IMO is uneven; some scenes he performs better than others.  Danes's performance (other than her fake crying in the Capulet vault) was generally strong and very believable; her words did not seem \\"acted\\" but rather natural.  The supporting cast was also very good with Tybalt and Benvolio standing out.<br /><br />There were some scenes that didn't work well for me.  The Capulet ball in particular was strange.  Mercutio came dressed in drag and this (unfounded) homosexual subtext was amplified by him prancing around on the stairs with some Chippendale dancers.  Just plain strange.  Also, the Queen Mab speech was weird and luckily cut short; Luhrman did try to tie it into the events as a sort-of intoxicated rambling at the \\"pre-party\\" (complete with Ecstasy) before Romeo crashes the ball.  Another weak performance was Lady Capulet who played it for laughs (which again I couldn't see from the text), and it was an unconvincing performance played that way.  The only time Lady Capulet seemed believable was when she played it serious (Tybalt's death, the argument with Juliet and Capulet).  Some students also didn't care for all of the musical numbers, but most liked how Luhrman tried to include contemporary songs into the movie.<br /><br />Some of the sequencing of scenes are a bit off, but this is a movie students definitely love and get into... which I think is how Shakespeare would want it.y good with Tybalt and Benvolio standing out. <br /> <br />There were some scenes that didn't work well for me.

B000P2A256|4.0|This album doesn't come close to \\"Songs about Jane.\\" The new disc is washed, scrubbed and polished to the point where you just want to hear some raw emotion out of Levine's voce but you never do. But instead what you do get is smartly written, smarmy pop gems that is still better than most of anything else on the radio these days.     All over the disc you get snippets of other artists that have influenced them and that mostly comes from the 80's. You get a Prince tune: \\"Kiwi,\\" with its metaphorical lyrics, \\"Goodnight Goodnight,\\" which sounds as if it fell out of Stevie Wonder's amazing songbook and the stunning \\"Better that we Break.\\" Maroon 5's a great band, but here it seems as if they are going after a new audience while trying to sustain their old but without branching out as artists. They can handle more than what they are doing on this disc. Levine at times, treads the same waters as he did in \\"Songs about Jane.\\"

0385340559|5.0|Itinerant loner Jack Reacher, a gargantuan modern day hero with an ethical sense of justice is wandering around the Pacific Northwest when he receives a desperate encrypted message through his ATM statement.  Frances Neagley an erstwhile member of an elite investigative unit of Army M.P.'s commanded by Reacher implores him to meet her in L.A.<br /><br />Their rendez-vous enlightens Reacher to the curious death of former team member Calvin Franz, an L.A. based private investigator.  Neagley contacted by Franz's wife learns that he'd tossed alive from a helicopter perishing after making contact with the Mojave desert floor.  Reacher who stills feels an intense sense of camaraderie with his former unit, attempts to mobilize the seven ogther remainin members only to find that two others are missing and incommunicato.  Neagley and Reacher gratefully welcome Karla Dixon and Dave O'Donnell to help them find out what happened tp Franz and the three missing remaining team members.<br /><br />One of them Tony Swan had been the director of security for a high tech munitions manufacturer with Pentagon contracts.  Their investigation, aided by Reacher's mathematical acumen detects a pilferage of a revolutionary surface to air missile from Swan's firm.  This advanced weaponry threatens to fall into the hands of an Middle Eastern entrepreneur, who has U.S. targets in mind.<br /><br />Reacher once again in command, leads his crack team on a trail of vengeance for their fallen comrades while trying to maintain national security.<br /><br />Child again in \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" inserts the heroic Reacher into a situation not of his own making.  His military background immediately snaps into place, as his natural instincts to lead and solve complex problems while satsifying his penchant to kick butt, immediately fires up.  My one problem with Child's latest thriller is that theusually solitary Reacher has to share the stage with other members of his elite team.
B000P2A256|3.0|Wow it's been five years and they're finally back. \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" is a fast-moving collection of upbeat, rock pop with a touch of soul. I'll just point out the ones that stood out to me. As much as their sophomore album is indeed different from the first there are a couple of songs that are similar from the tracks off the debut album. It's a good follow up album but can't top \\"Song About Jane.\\"  <br /> <br />1. If I Never... - sounds like \\"This Love\\" this song's got a sexy groove to it. Reminds me of Jamiroquai's \\"Virtual Insanity.\\" <br /> <br />2. Makes Me Wonder - 1st single, when I hear this song I think of disco like John Travolta shaking his thang in his white tux.  <br /> <br />3. Little of Your Time - the most fast paced song off the album, not a fan of it though... <br /> <br />5. Wont Go Home Without You - \\"She Will Be Love\\" Part II just says it all and the most memorable song off the album and my favorite. I hope this will be a single, very catchy. Lyrics are amazing \\"Every night you cry yourself to sleep/Thinking why does this happen to me/Why does every moment have to be so hard.../ Of all the things I felt I've never really showed perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go, should not ever let you go...\\" <br /> <br />6. Nothing Lasts Forever - sounds like \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\" great slow and sweet melodic hooks. As you listen to this song it tells a story of trying at a long distant relationship but breaking up is the only way. I too hope this will be a single. Meaningful lyrics \\"Built a wall around my heart/Never let it fall apart/ Everyday with every word whispered we get more far away/The distance between us makes it so hard to stay/Nothing last forever/\\" My second favorite next to \\"Won't Go Home...\\" However Adam used almost this exact same chorus in \\"Heard Em Say\\" by Kanye West. <br /> <br />8. Goodnight Goodnight - the guitar opening sounds like something you've heard before but once you get pass the intro the song will grow on you. Another slow rock song, sounds like \\"Must Get Out.\\"  <br /> <br />9. Not Falling Apart - can anyone say Sting or The Police?  <br /> <br />10. Kiwi - Prince knockoff, funky tune for sure but will not be on my playlist. <br /> <br />11. Better That We Break - love the piano intro on this slow song. A sad goodbye song. \\"Now waking up is hard to do/And sleeping's impossible too/Everything's reminding me of you/What can I do?\\" However in my opinion this song ended abruptly, even though he's told the ending to the story the music offers a completed ending but it's the way Adam continued to sing his vocal leads to you to think there should be something more.  <br /> <br />I also suggest giving some non-album Maroon 5 songs a listen \\"Rag Doll\\" \\"Woman\\" and \\"If You Only Knew.\\"  <br />
B000GFLKEY|4.0|As others have indicated, if you think you have it figured out, you will be totally surprised before the end.  As suspense films go, everything fits together when you get to the end with nothing that suspends belief (unlike another film I recently saw).  The acting is very well done. <br /> <br />I gave the film only four stars because of the thoroughly gratuitous use of one very frequent four letter word.  Its use is so over the top that it takes away from everything else.  I saw the film in a theater.  Some months later we were on an overseas flight and \\"Inside Man\\" was the in-flight movie.  There were small children on the flight.  I wondered how that would work, given the ubiquitous use of that word.  Well, the word never occurred anywhere in the film!  Further, no one's lips were out of synchronization with the dialogue at any point. I have since read that Singapore will not allow films with foul language in them.  Apparently, film companies must shoot two versions of the same film.  They could give us films with less objectionable material, but choose not to do so.  They even have the same films with less objectionable material already available.  Can I give Hollywood two stars only?

6305095442|5.0|Allow me to preface this review with a helpful fact.  A few years back when Spin Magazine was writing about the films they felt were the greatest of the 20th century, they chose to include Sam Raimi's sequel to his very first film; which was a small independent horror called The Evil Dead.  The Evil Dead was a great film in it's own right, however, the editors at Spin wanted to give Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn the recognition they felt it deserved.  So they placed it at the top of their list...that's right, they felt that it is, in fact, the single greatest cinematic achievement of the 20th century.<br /><br />Evil Dead 2 follows Ash Williams and his girlfriend into a small creepy Michigan cottage where they stumble upon some recordings that contain readings from an ancient relic called the book of the dead, and by playing these recordings they unleash demonic supernatural forces that quickly haunt and possess everything from the trees outside and Popeye's lamp to Ash's hand and his girlfriend's severed head.  The shenanigans unfold and Ash is more game than perhaps anyone to take on these evil forces as best as he can, but some sort of defeat is consistently inevitable.<br /><br />As a reader I hope you are not anticipating my rebuttal to Spin Magazine here. I just so happen to concur 100% with Spin's gutsy assertion.  On the surface of Evil Dead 2, we are seeing vintage 80s shock horror but it certainly isn't presented deeply enough to qualify amongst the failures within that genre.  Evil Dead 2 is microcosmically structured like classic slapstick and macrocosmically it functions as pure satire.  In this sense it's budget is used firmly to it's advantage and runs together with the theme of making a select audience laugh, first and foremost.  Those who are both distinctly either disturbed by gore or preoccupied by gore as a strength in horror, should take keen note that gore in this film is applied almost exclusively for physical slapstick comedy.  Those who hate gore will hate it here and those who love to be immersed in gore may not understand or appreciate it's use in Evil Dead 2.<br /><br />We get to see a chubby fruit cellar witch's soul-swallowing head extend via shoddy stop-motion effects.  We get to see an eyeball pop out of her head and shoot across the room into some chick's mouth.  We get so see blood spray humorously and pretty consistently out of the walls and floors of the cottage.  We get to see Ash fight his hand, cut it off, and add a chainsaw to where his hand once was.  We get to see him kill his girlfriend and fight both her severed head and headless body in a tool shed at the same time.  We get to see Ash get clumsily chased around the house by a force of evil we never see.  We also get to see the volume of slapstick comedy increase as the film goes on and finally we get to see a conclusion that still makes me kind of wish they never made a sequel (even though Army of Darkness is in and of itself a very good movie).<br /><br />Evil Dead 2 may require a deeper degree of movie history appreciation, perhaps more specifically to exploitation and horror films.  I know I sound like a movie snob saying that but the film does offer some fun and fitting tributes or references to past films.  I think it is definitely fair to say that Raimi has a great appreciation for movies in general and we can plainly see that he has so much fun making them.  Evil Dead 2 for me is fun, affable, and carefree; it is all the things it shouldn't be on it's surface, and it is perfect for that fact alone.it here and those who love to be immersed in gore may not understand or appreciate it's use in Evil Dead 2.

0385733577|5.0|I devoured this book in a day!  Extremely well written, and an excellent story.  I can't wait for the next one.
B00008GKEG|5.0|People, please.  What could be more entertaining than hours upon hours of the Beatles telling their story?  I have watched this many times, and never tire of it.  If you are a fan, you are missing out if you don't see this.  And the bonus material is great too - Paul George and Ringo jamming and reminscing - wow!
0786838655|5.0|The writing style and content is great and the story captivated both my son and I.  Highly recommended for all ages that love imaginative stories.
0385340559|5.0|No one does it better.<br /><br />Period.<br /><br />For those of you looking for an introduction to Lee Child, I still strongly recommend starting with \\"PERSUADER\\" - which in my opinion, has one of the all-time greatest first chapters ever. And I mean, ever.
032147404X|4.0|This book is excellent if you are looking for a quick guide/tips style photography book. <br /> <br />It is quick, light and interesting photography book that you can complete it in one or two reading sessions. <br /> <br />The book also includes sample images of the writer which are really professional and inspiring. <br />He also has good sense of humor and you will enjoy reading his book. <br /> <br />It gives very good and useful working-tips for settings used to photograph in different situationns and occasions, however, it does not illustrate \\"why\\" (which the writer says clearly from the beginning it is beyond the scope of his book)! <br /> <br /> <br />If you would like to really \\"understand\\" and be able to make the decision yourself, I would recommend Bryan Peterson, Understanding Exposure book. You will really love it.
B000P2A256|1.0|Blech.  I really enjoyed Songs About Jane, even though I'm way past my teen years - and I was eagerly waiting for something new.  This is *similar* to the first CD, but there's absolutely nothing new, memorable, or *pounding* about it.  Bubblegum Pop at it's best/worst.  If you like the singles Makes Me Wonder, or Won't Go Home Without You, then you'll probably enjoy the CD.  But if you're looking for something fresh or interesting, then keep looking.  I won't be keeping this CD. Too bad, I had such high hopes...
0143038419|5.0|I haven't quite finished but love this book so far.  It is so entertaining and easy to read.  I can identify with the writer in sooo many ways.  I feel like I need to go to all of these places.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Can I just say, WOW this is bad...Well some of it. <br />Cons: <br />Gwen's L.A.M.B. album is still one of my favorite CD's. Tracks like \\"Serious\\", \\"Crash\\" and \\"Bubble Pop Electric\\" complimented the standout tracks released as sinlges. The only bad song was that annoying \\"Hollaback Girl\\" which eventually grew on me (since it was played everywhere and it was catchy). But this album really took a step back for Gwen, especially the lead single \\"Wind it Up\\". What was she thinking when she recorded these songs, half of the album is nothing but \\"Hollaback Girl\\" knockoffs and even more annoying. <br />Pros: <br />Now let's get to the good, I was blown away with the better half of the album. Tracks like \\"Early Winter\\" and \\"Wonderful Life\\" sound almost magical and continue where \\"Serious\\" left off. They almost take you to fairy tale world. Alot of these songs are 80's influenced and that is where Gwen shines through. Her voice has this retro feel to it and almost captures that playful sound Madonna had in the 80's.   <br />Track Review: <br />1.  1/10 Wind It Up - Bad, I can't believe they thought it sounded good. I actually bought it on itunes hoping  it would grow on me, but it didn't. <br />2. 10/10 The Sweet Escape - Wow, A change of pace from \\"Wind It Up\\". It has everything it needs to be a radio hit, catchy chorus, good beat and Akon singing in the background. <br />3.  4/10 Orange County Girl - Very annoying, It has no melody and not even a girl in her twenties can pull it off. <br />4. 20/10 Early Winter - My favorite song on the album, almost cried to it. She just sounds so honest and sincere. <br />5.  7/10 Now That You Got It - It's not that bad of a song, I found myself singing it throughout the day. <br />6. 10/10 4 In The Morning - Beautiful ballad, continues where \\"the Real Thing\\" left off. <br />7.  5/10 Yummy - What is this, not only do we have to listen to \\"Wind It Up\\", but here is part 2. <br />8.  8/10Flourescent - I didn't like this song at first, but itgrew on me. very catchy. Nice to hear Gwen sing. <br />9.  7/10 Breakin'Up - What is this a Verizon commercial, or a song. It's fun, but repititive (the \\"tell me can you hear me now\\" part is funny). <br />10. 6/10 Don't Get It Twisted - It has nice lyrics and chorus, but the beat is annoying. <br />11. 9/10 U Started It - It has a great beat, very catchy and sounds like \\"Dress You Up\\" by Madonna. <br />12. 10/10 Wonderful Life - Leave the best for last was a smart thing to do. I'm not surprised,that this song is co-written by Linda Perry. <br />
B00006RCNW|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas present <br />for my daughter.  She loves it!
0307346609|5.0|I got caught by the terrific title - World War Z!  What is so great about this zombie thriller is that its presentation is dead (pardon the put) serious.  The action is B-grade at best (zombine bodies advancing despite an array of military action, eating humans, etc) and that makes it a much better book.  Despite the absurd, over the top premise, it reads like a documentary of the apocalypse featuring the good, bad and ugly.  In fact, the \\"oral history\\" is preferable to the diary in that it introduces a range of dialogue from several characters.  <br /> <br />As is common in books of this sort, there are all kinds of nasty and funny  references to today's cultural and political scene. I could not help but think of the book except in terms of a movie and found myself wondering how great it would be on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Great idea, great execution.
B000002U82|5.0|If you are looking for a happy album, this isn't the one.  The title of the album should give you a clue as to the mood of the songs.  The title could just as easily be \\"The Dark Side Of The Earth\\".  The recording paints a sad picture of the human condition.  It shows the physical and mental consequences when a person is constantly being pressured by the competitive, workaholic society.  The person as depicted in the album realizes that the inevitability of old age and mortality are rapidly approaching him as he recognizes that such a lifestyle is futile in the long run.  In \\"Breathe\\", he is immediately told by society, most likely his parents, while he is very young that he must work hard and never take a break or a vacation in order that he may achieve great success in the world and get rich.  The lure of the dollar is a powerful thing and many people, like the person depicted in Pink Floyd's masterpiece, worship it.   The stress really builds up in \\"On The Run\\".  He is constantly being bombarded by all the demands that society places upon him.  \\"I got to perform.  I got to catch that plane.  I got to get to that meeting on time.\\"  He is constantly on the move, never resting or taking time to enjoy all of life's pleasures. He says,\\" I will work until I die.  I'll sleep when I'm dead.  Retirement is for sissies.\\"  In \\"Time\\", he reviews his life so far and realizes it was all for nothing.  He is left to confront old age and his own mortality and realizes lost opportunities.  He could've spent more time with his family or friends.  He could've gone to church and learned about God and spirituality.  He \\"runs and runs to catch up with the sun\\" and has a physical and mental breakdown.  Death eventually comes to him in \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\".  On his deathbed, he says, \\"And I am not afraid of dying.  Any time will do, I don't mind.  Why should I be afraid of dying?  There's no reason for it.  You got to go sometime.\\"  \\"Money\\" confronts the evils of capitalism in allits ugliness.  The song says that the rich and famous are human too and they must also confront the harsh realities of life sooner or later, whether it is the death of a loved one or their own deaths.  \\"Us And Them\\" looks at the futility of war and competition and says that we are all ordinary men and women and we must all get along and work together for peace because human life is short and fragile.  \\"Brain Damage\\" shows how normal men and women can sometimes lose their peace of mind and even their sanity when confronted by all the demands of society.  \\"Eclipse\\" summarizes the futility of working so hard to amass the most wealth because sooner or later everything \\"under the sun\\" will disappear and all that will be left is complete darkness.  \\"And everything under the sun is in tune but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.\\"  The \\"eclipse\\" is one's own death.  This album should be listened to by all the so-called \\"Type A\\" people or workaholics who are constantly chasing after success and material gain.  A great rock masterpiece that should be listened to again and again.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|In comparison to Meteora and Hybrid theory, this album just does not measure up. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, it's still a decent CD, and definitely better than most of the so-called music out there, but I expected more from this album, and was a bit disappointed when I didn't get it. <br /> <br />I know that Linkin Park did not want to imitate their old sound, but this experimentation with a newer sound did not work in my mind. What I loved about their old sound is that it was uniquely their own and uniquely Linkin Park .
B000OCXMAE|5.0|First of all, If you think you are going to listen to Hybrird Theory part 3, Boy are you in for a surprise. Not one song on this album is familiar, and that isn't such a bad thing. I am a huge fan of their first 2 albums, and couldn't wait till I got my hands on \\"Minutes to Midnight\\". At first I was dissapointed because it wasn't familiar, it was too different. But I wasn't going to throw away 4 years of waiting, I gave it a few more listens and everytime I played it, The songs grew on me more and more. I found myself listening to this album nonstop and trust me you will too, You just have to be patient. The sooner you get over the fact that Linkin Park has changed, the sooner you will start enjoying their new sound.  Track Review:  1.  ?/? Wake - Introduction, Nothing Interesting.  2.  5/10 Given Up - Hardest song on the Album, But not feeling it...=(  3. 10/10 Leave Out all the Rest - Most radio friendly song, good chorus and very well put together. Definitely single material.  4. 10/10 Bleed it Out - Awesome song, Mike and Chester like the good old days.  5. 10/10 Shadow of the Day - Great song, reminds me of U2's \\"With or Without You\\"  6. 10/10 What I've Done - Lead single, solid track.  7.  8/10 Hands Held High - Mike's moment, very political. Sounds like \\"Where'd You Go\\"   8. 10/10 No More Sorrow - Favorite song on the album, Chester doing what he does best. Sounds like \\"System of a Down\\".  9. 10/10 Valentine's Day - Beautiful song...  10. 5/10 In Between - Most boring and slow track on the album.  11. 5/10 In Pieces - Chester's version of \\"In Between\\".  12.10/10 The Little Things Give You Away - Starts off slow but picks up after 2 minutes, the last 2 1/2 minutes are awesome.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|The order was shipped promptly by Amazon. The CD is great, full of good songs from a female artist I believe with be around for a long time to come. Her vocal skill is incredible and the music just makes you feel happy.  Can't wait for her next album!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie is perhaps the best ever series of supurb vignets .... Multible stories within the stories. Its like watching half a dozen great mini comedy drama's at once. Each one is perfectly scripted and  brillliantly acted. The Cast is among the best you can find in any movie since the Wizard of Oz. You've got to feel sorry for the director, Richard Curtis, as he can never Direct any movie as good or better than this one. <br />This is a flawless feel good funny, funny movie. Every one involved is doing there best work ever !!! Oh, and an AMAZING soundtrack, from Joni Mitchell to Kelly Clarkson to Dido. <br />I've seen Love Actually 6 or 7 times and Loved it and learned from it each time! <br />Get it, see it, share it with someone you Love !!!
B0001KZM3O|4.0|The sadness and madness that drove Pink Floyd's prior works comes to a full head in this work.  It may very well be Roger Waters's personal autobiography.  His father, Eric Fletcher Waters, was killed in combat during World War II and the album is dedicated specifically to him.  It also deals with the social and political situation in the world back in the 1980's.  The Falklands War and Reaganomics are depicted here.  By now the huge gap separating Waters from the rest of Pink Floyd was irreparable.  Beginning with Dark Side Of The Moon, Waters had assumed his leadership role in the band and his reign tightened with the release of each subsequent album leading up to this one.  Richard Wright, the band's keyboardist, was fired during The Wall recording sessions because Waters thought Wright was lazy and unproductive.  If anyone was deemed worthy of the moniker Pink Floyd, it was Waters.  Waters' focus was more on the lyrics and Gilmour's focus was more on the music.  As a result of this disparity, there was constant friction between Waters and Gilmour.  This led ultimately in Waters and the rest of the band going their separate ways soon after the release of this album.  Waters tried desperately to claim ownership of the band name when his former colleagues reunited for recording and touring in 1987. But those efforts eventually failed and Gilmour, Mason, and Wright recorded and toured under the Pink Floyd name.  This recording is the height of all the frustration, anger, and loneliness that one can bear.  It certainly was the case for Roger Waters.
B000O178BY|1.0|NIN used to be my favorite.  I have to question what happened during the last 7 years because I never would have imagined the musician I respected so much stooping to politics as the only appealing factor driving interest in his \\"efforts\\".  Honestly, leave the ultra-liberal pro-conspiracy theory rhetoric with the experimental drug abusers who swear they've met Jesus.  Any musical quality this CD may have presented was flushed with its inability to fight outside of the mold it created for itself.  The electronic bleeps and bloops are abused to no end.  Its so benign I'd guess he used the same samples for every song only leaving variety to alternative arrangements.  The abuse of that effects slider that simulates a guitar solo is nauseatingly bothersome as well.  His confidence in his vocals reeks to the point that he makes careless efforts just expecting you to believe he knows what he's doing.  The high school vocabulary of his lyrics hasn't progressed past the simplicity of pseudo-intellectual metaphors that just beg the listener to believe Reznor is privy to some profound awareness that we just have to pat ourselves on the back for being able to interpret.  Overall, I expect more out of my music than this.  I expect more out of my politicians as well.  At least they wear a suit.  That way I can be prepared to ignore their pompous opinion driven babble.  Reznor should take note.
B000F5GO0A|5.0|This is definitely one of the most influential albums i've heard recently and maybe ever. It combines a bit of Balkan sounds, a bit of Tiersen (yes you've definitely heard of him!) and a bit (just a little bit) of indie and maybe post rock - at least, this is what my ears tell me :).<br /><br />The most interesting thing maybe, is that the whole album is mostly the work of a single person (Zach Condon) whose age is about 20. When i first listened the album i thought that this was composed either from a Balkan band / orchestra or from some mature musicians. Well, i was wrong! Most of the recordings were made by him in his own house! This is his third personal album but the first under the \\"Beirut\\" name.<br /><br />It is difficult to say which tracks are worthing from this album since most of them do! Few exceptions exist of course, but they are the exceptions and not the rule ;)<br /><br />So, five stars from me and highly suggested to anyone who's looking for something fresh, inspiring and different. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed
B000NQR7LQ|4.0|This album took a while to grow on me when I first started listening to it a few years ago, but once it did, I loved it. It is not quite good as A Trick Of The Tail, but still very good IMHO.  This package does not have as much quality bonus material as compared to the \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" CD/SACD.  I wish they could have included some live bonus video like the aforementioned but instead we get some very poor quality TV appearance.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Very cool Movie. Clive Oven saves the World's only pregnant women. Everbody in world wants her violently as Clive tries to get her to safety. Really well done. Very active Movie with requisite stunts  so I liked  the movie and would recommend it to others especially if you like Movies that talk about the  near future like I Robot etc.Not as  good as  I Robot but in that kind near future films genre.
B0000025H6|5.0|When this album was recorded and released, Pink Floyd were on top of the world having achieved all the success they wanted to achieve.  But sometimes success has a price tag.  The price tag is the \\"wall\\" which sometimes separates yourself from the rest of society.  American society in particular worships success and material gain at the cost of one's physical and mental health.  It also creates a kind of competition and even hostility between you and the rest of the world.  That's what Dark Side Of The Moon looked at.  The Wall gets more specific and tells the story of the pressures of being a rock n' roll star.  Most if not all rock musicians strive for fortune and fame and hanging out with all the groupies.  But sometimes that lifestyle leaves you with all your personal demons and those demons can drive you insane.  Those demons may be your own responsibility or those created by family or business issues.  The album begins with \\"In The Flesh?\\" and the character portrayed is a famous rock n' roll musician getting ready to go on stage.  But he is suddenly confronted by all his demons such as his father getting sent off to a foreign land to go to war.  This segues into \\"The Thin Ice\\".  His wife comforts his newborn son telling the baby that his grandfather will be OK.  The first brick in the wall is the separation he feels as his father is being sent off to war.  The next brick is that of abuse at school by both classmates and teacher when he was a young boy.  This type of treatment leads him ultimately to rebel against the educational system.  He asks in \\"Mother\\" if he should cut himself off from all the people supposedly responsible for his tribulations.  \\"Mother, should I build the wall?\\"  In other words, he is asking if he should ever associate with these people again.  In \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" the horrifying pictures of his father fighting and getting killed in the war are brought to his attention again.   He then looks for something to fill in the \\"Empty Spaces\\".He tries having sex with all the groupies in \\"Young Lust\\" in order to numb his pain.  He avoids all communication with the groupie back at the hotel by watching war movies on television in \\"One Of My Turns\\".  Finally all the violence he sees on the television brings back to memory the death of his own father and he goes insane and starts tearing up the room.  He is so beside himself that he hurls the television out of his hotel room window onto the street below.  He feels remorseful of his behavior and pleads with his mate, \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\".  Finally everything that drove him to his current state of mind comes back to haunt him.  This is the third brick.  He is so angry and upset that he avoids all physical contact with people in \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\".  This closes the first half.  The second half opens with him working hard to overcome his demons in \\"Hey You\\".  He asks \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" who can help him.  He returns to watching television and tries calling his wife on the phone in \\"Nobody Home\\".  No one responds.  He asks if there is anybody out there who can feel the pain he is feeling.  He remembers somebody named Vera Lynn.  He cries out against the apparent injustice of war and demands to \\"bring the boys back home\\".  He then turns to drugs in \\"Comfortably Numb\\".  He is given an anesthetic by the doctor to calm him down.  He arrives at the show and is ready to perform no matter how severe his hardships.  At the show, he weeds out the people he dislikes the most from the audience.  He becomes kind of a dictator to his audience.  The people who are in his favor give him a \\"Hail Hitler\\" kind of salute.  After the show, he takes to the streets to weed out the \\"weaklings, the queens, the coons, the reds, and the Jews\\" of the city.  These people to him are nothing but worms in his sight and must be wiped off the face of the earth.  Finally, he is tried in a court of law for all the atrocities he has committed.  He  tells the judge that insanity was the reason for his crimes.  He is then sentenced to be \\"exposed before his peers\\".  The crowd in the courtroom then chants to \\"tear down the wall\\" meaning they are glad he is getting his just deserts. The wall is finally torn down and the city tries to rebuild itself.  This album applies not only to rock stars but also to anybody at the top of their profession who feels constant pressure to succeed and wants to lash out at the world in the midst of this stiff competition.  Such people may turn to drugs, sex, or crime for their escape.  Such themes is what makes The Wall such a powerful masterpiece.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|The movie itself is a classic on so many levels...this particular package contains promotional items that the movie buff, at least, will find intriguing. The film itself is surprisingly non-dated considering that it was made in the very early 50's. And Leslie Nielson sometimes actuall acts.

075640407X|3.0|The Name of the Wind is a solid, mostly entertaining debut novel. The characters are likable, the pace is brisk, and the writing is first rate. I like how Kvothe relies on his cleverness (rather than his skill as a warrior, for example) to overcome his obstacles. I also like the sensible explanation of magic. As an author, Rothfuss reminds me of Robin Hobb, who has made a career out of producing well-written, satisfying, and ultimately forgettable fantasies. While I enjoyed the novel while I read it, once I finished it I didn't spare it another thought. It simply is not provocative, audacious, or unpredictable. There are no \\"oh sh*%\\" moments. It lacks an edge, in my opinion. Despite being executed with style and competence, the storyline is so familiar. Where's the originality? I also think that Kvothe is too capable. How many young people are efficient woodsmen, lockpicks, thieves, singers, arcanists, and lutists? He has too many advantages over everyone else, so it is no surprise that he succeeds in his endeavors. Also, the novel is missing dramatic conflict. The Chandrian make a brief, melodramatic appearance but never return. Instead of facing them in a climax, Kvothe encounters a stoned dragon with an equally stoned Denna as support. The episode--especially the slapstick comedy of Denna being hopped up--seems out of place. Also, the novel lacks closure. I don't see much progress. At the end, Kvothe is still a student at the academy, still has issues with Ambrose, still wants to defeat the Chandrian (but never meets them), still likes Denna without embarking on a romance, etc. Nothing is resolved. As the first volume in a series, I understand that Rothfuss wants to introduce the characters and the storylines; however first volumes still need to provide a satisfactory resolution. While I will most likely read the subsequent volumes, I won't rush to the bookstore or library to get them.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals by Pink Floyd exposes the carnal, materialistic side of humankind in all its ugliness.  The album divides people into three groups:  dogs, pigs, and sheep.  The dogs signify people, especially those of low or middle social or economic status, who are so ambitious and competitive that they will step on other people's toes to get to the top of the social or corporate ladder.  The pigs signify people, especially big-business tycoons or greedy politicians, who take advantage of people of lower social or economic status in order to advance their own commercial or political empires.  The sheep are people of ordinary social status who blindly obey whatever society tells them to do even if they know it will compromise their moral or religious principles.  At this point, Roger Waters was exerting greater control in the band and this caused hostility among the band members, particularly among keyboardist Richard Wright.  The band began to feel more separated from its fans due to them playing in large venues such as football stadiums.  The famous pig balloon that has become a staple in their concerts started here.  Pink Floyd have never shied away from the hard realities of the human condition by creating a magical wonderland full of joy, peace, and harmony.  They have never created a utopia in their work and probably never will.  That's why their albums are so influential and continue to sell to this very day.  Their music is objective not subjective.  This is life as it actually is, not what we would like it to be, according to Pink Floyd.
0307276902|1.0|This book full of \\"embellishments and lies\\" is exactly what is wrong with Oprah's book club. The moment I saw Frey on TV with Oprah, saying \\"he didn't need AA or any twelve step program to kick his addictions, he did it all by himself\\" I knew he was lying.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks they can kick addictions \\"BY THEMSELVES\\" is so completely ego-driven and self-centered, they can't possibly achieve \\"freedom\\" themselves. They can't even stop lying to themselves and to everyone else around them! It can not be done alone. It is only with the help of God, or one's \\"Higher Power\\" than any real changes can be made. This is ultimately one of the most powerful gifts of addiction: to find one's Higher Power and to learn what it means to \\"be on one's knees.\\" To ask for Help outside of oneself and to find it. This is the Gift worth having. It cannot be done alone.<br /><br />To see Oprah lapping this up - this whole ridiculous story, and Frey's lies about \\"kicking his addictions alone, and 12 step programs aren't necessary...\\" and then making this person RICH by selling their b.s. book - was sickening, and to see her entire audience cheering Frey on as he made these false statements made me turn off the TV.<br /><br />This whole debacle, book and promotions, made me sick. Why should a story of evil-doing make someone a millionaire, and why should everyone in Oprah's empire be reading it and talking about it \\"every day\\" at work?<br /><br />Have none of these people ever had a real case of the terror and destructiveness of addictions in their own group of family or friends? It is NOTHING TO CELEBRATE. Frey's lies are just part of the continuation of the package called \\"the absence of God.\\"<br /><br />To see a furor over an author saying he was WORSE than what he really was makes my head spin. What has happened to us in this culture that people get rich and famous when they lie about how \\"bad\\" they were?<br /><br />What has happened to us, and why are people and stories like this being promoted? What has happened here? It used to be that people and their stories were promoted if they did GOOD in the world. Then we have Oprah promoting the WORST in people's characters. Things seem to be turned completely upside down.<br /><br />Oprah is no \\"leader of the people\\" no matter how much money she appears to give away, or how she lit into Frey later on. Frey's pack of lies just goes to show it. His book would never have achieved the notoriety it did if Oprah hadn't put it on her show. Things need to change.<br /><br />Update July 2009: Since people seem to think that there needs to be an argument about whether or not people can \\"kick\\" on their own, please read one of the best reviews I have seen here on the subject. It is clear that this reviewer really knows what they are talking about.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Every so often, there's a movie where the hero has amnesia.  Even with amnesia, a person can establish an identity in a few weeks, judge new people and surroundings, and function.  In addition, such movie heroes are easy to identify with, because the audience seems to know as much as the hero.<br /><br />Well, in this movie, our hero has the opposite problem, an inability to make new memories.  And that kind of problem is indeed rare, and it merits some discussion.<br /><br />What would you do if you couldn't form new memories?  Well, you would probably be institutionalized, or cared for by family or friends.  Without that, it would be important to be in familiar surroundings as much as possible, ones you would remember.  You would remember your old house, your old car, and, of course, your old acquaintances.  But you would not remember new possessions or friends.  And you would be totally lost in a new town, while in your old one, you would know where your friends' houses were, where your bank was, where the restaurants were, and so on.<br /><br />You would need to avoid strangers.  And you would need a way to take notes, read and understand those notes, and keep a rough diary.  Probably you would need to trust a few friends to keep a few key documents and help you update them occasionally.  And you would also need a safety deposit box for notes, diary entries, money (even with a bank account, a safety deposit box would be very useful), and so forth.<br /><br />The key problems would be taking notes, figuring out how to make sure you could and would read and understand those notes, going on \\"missions\\" (even a short errand would be a major event), and keeping your privacy.<br /><br />For any important task, you would almost surely need to be backed up by a trusted friend, known by you from back when you were able to make memories.  That friend would need to be with you at such occasions or as a minimum constantly available by phone.<br /><br />You could write cryptic notes that only you could decipher, using your earlier memories.  But it would be hard to be sure just what secrets you had divulged.  Basically, you could keep your ideas private only by making sure nobody else saw them.  And that would be tricky.  That's one more place where a safety deposit box could help somewhat.<br /><br />I'm writing all this in order to explain just how weird the situation is for our hero in this movie, who is basically, um, \\"open loop,\\" and cut off from almost everything that is familiar.  It's a fascinating and suspenseful movie, but one can see that the hero is at a tremendous disadvantage.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some things the hero knows quite well, and that makes the movie work.  Rather than offer a spoiler, let me just say that I highly recommend it.write cryptic notes that only you could decipher, using your earlier memories.

B00005JPMC|4.0|Been a while since I last saw a good action movie. Shooter is a good action movie. About snipers, US foreign policy, CIA assassinations ...    Spoiler follows:     The ending could have been much better. They should have left those scumbags laughing and carrying on with their evil deeds. It would have allowed the message of the movie to really hit home with the audience. That was a missed opportunity.
B00006RG9K|5.0|I've been a Genesis ever since I was around   9-10 years old. I grew up,listening to classic rock. Yes, I STILL listen to classic rock,and I ALWAYS will. I bought this SUPERB DVD,last year,or the year before, but I don't recall which year. Now,I'm don't attend concerts, on a regular basis. Though,I did go to 2 Genesis concerts--I went to a Genesis concert, during the Invisible Touch Tour,in Pittsburgh,PA.and during the Live The Way We Walk Tour,also in Pittsburgh,PA. Both concerts were ABSOLUTELY GREAT!!!       The DVD overall, is OUTSTANDING!! The video quality is GREAT, and the sound is SUPERB as well. I have a Pioneer home theater system,and the DVD sounds FANTASTIC. Phil Collins,is an EXCELLENT vocalist. Phil Collins, is a SUPERB drummer,as well!! The rest of the band members--Tony Banks,Mike Rutherford,are fantastic musicians. Chester Thomson and Daryl Stuermer,are very talented musicians,as well.Chester and Daryl,were only performing with Genesis,during tours,not in the studio. They of course,are no longer with Genesis,as they only currently, perform,with Phil Collins,in the studio,and on stage.
B00003CWTI|3.0|Magnolia is the story of a dying man (Jason Robards)who wants to see his estranged son one last time. Julianne Moore overacts as the former gold digger wife who has grown to genuinely love her husband too late. Wracked with shame, Moore's character is suicidal with guilt for her past as her husband lies on his death bed. Tom Cruise is the estranged son who makes his living as a mysogonistic and unhinged motivational speaker teaching men (who are a mix of Promise Keepers meets Snoop Dog)how to manipulate women into casual sex.  <br /> <br />Besides the main plot of the spooky, croaking, dying man and his guilt ridden wife, there is the story of a naive and dim witted policeman's (John C. Riley) attraction to an emotionally unstable coke head.  Several other stories intersect including William H. Macy as a washed up former child quiz show phenom, a present day version of the same, and a bitter aging, hedonist game show host who's done one to many television shows. <br /> <br />Personally, I would award Julianne Moore a lifetime achievement award for over acting, and Magnolia only adds to her body of work, but Cruise, as usual, is riveting and spell binding. John C. Riley and Phillip Seymore Hoffman (as the dying man's caregiver) alone are enough to make the movie worth watching. <br /> <br />Manolia is not for everyone but if you like movies that don't come from the Hollywood cookie cutting machine, you should give it a chance. Manolia just tries way to hard to be thought provoking and quirky but it's still draws you in.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This DVD series was well worth the wait.  The stunning photography in this original BBC version of Planet Earth is enhanced by the narration of Sir David Attenborough.

B00009UW0N|4.0|The oldest sister of all psycho-thrillers: a modern revision of the boogeyman's myth shot in 1978 by John Carpenter, probably the only horror movies artisan still in action. Although many of the rudiments of psycho movies can be already find in the first italian giallos and, of course, in Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\", its very calculated prologue contains as if it was a manual all the leit-motives of the genre: the use of the subjective camera and the steadycam for supporting the suspense scenes; atmospherical travellings; obssessive and disturbing sound effects and cold-blood murders. Proving once more that to suggest is more effective than to resort to explicit shots, and looking for a pure horror show without gratuitous violence Carpenter reinvents wisely through the tradition in this very smart and stylised horror classic: for example, the suggestion that colour white can hold a devilish connotation is already in Edgar Poe's \\" The narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\\". Donald Pleasance plays the psychiatrist Dr. Loomis, a sort of modern Van Helsing and the man who better knows the evil nature of his patient Michael Myers, recently escaped from the asylum Dr.Loomis rules.<br /><br />Another chance to recover this indisputable classic. Widescreen edition.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I love to surf and am really good at it. I'll wake up and look out my window to see how the waves on the fishing pond look and if there is a little breeze, it's time to hang ten. John Mayer just takes what the Beach Boys and Jan & Dean did and takes it to a new level. The whole CD has a \\"Beach blanket Bingo\\" vibe to it. It's sunny, it's happy, it's a snickers bar. This guy is a man's man. He reminds me of a surfing Johnny Cash. I think his next video should be for the song gravity. What he should do is hop on a surfboard dressed in cowboy boots and a ten gallon hat. He should have a Pantera t-shirt on because his music has a rough edge to it. Whenever the song says gravity, he should fall off the surf board. There's no better way to illustrate gravity than falling off your surfboard. I think his next album should be an album of surfing cover songs to keep expanding his ever growing male fan base. I heard a couple girls like him, but this is dude music. <br /> <br />I've formed a Beach Boys/John Mayer cover band called Vulgar display of surfing. We play nothing but beach songs, but we play them at a speed metal pace with angst. We played a Burger King regional manager meeting last month and had the place whipped into a frenzy. They were throwing whoppers at each other and chasing dogs on motorized scooters. It was quite a scene. If you like angry surfer music, this is your platter, if not, you need to catch a wave to average.

B000MXPE7Y|5.0|Matt Damon is excellent in his portrayal of a CIA spook. The run time of this film is almost 3 hours, but the story line and suspense is such that you stay glued to the screen and at no time does it lose your interest. The supporting cast, especially John Turturro really add so much to the film.  It really is the best spy movie I have seen in many, many years and I'm almost 70 years old...

B0000648WZ|4.0|The author, Robert Heinlein, was criticized for Starship Troopers. It was seen as pro-war, or pro-establishment. Some labeling the work fascism. Even 20 years later, there were still those, willing to say anything, true or not, to discredit Heinlein. Heinlein, the author of 20 or so other novels, was no raving fascist either, in his youth he'd been active in the Socialist party.  They're not afraid of the truth in Starship Troopers. . . When Rico (the Lead) is asked why he let a squad member take off their helmet during a training exercise, Rico says, &#34;Because I wanted to win, Sir&#34;.  I watched Starship Troopers with a young friend. When the violence begins - when a Trooper gets killed during basic training - my friend was instilled with a sense of hero-worship I think. He was in awe of what these movie makers were allowed to show. And the Troopers still had those guns. . . I know if they were real guns. . . I'd be afraid. . . Isn't that the whole point - to pretend it's real? Is this fear, this brow-beating, what makes an action or horror movie popular? They do say, a near death experience - like a roller-coaster ride - or perhaps a horror movie - leave us thrilled to be alive.  Starship Troopers is filmed as if this is a war-movie from the future. Or as if this is a documentary, used for recruitment purposes. Is that the same thing as a war-movie? Late in the movie, Rico finds his friends all getting killed off, and he's promoted to Commander. Since this movie is done as if a recruitment-ad. . . I was left to wonder. . . is this what appeals to me? Do I secretly dream all my friends get killed, or fired, and then I'm made boss? Is this the standard movie plot? Is this the 'payoff' of a movie? I was left to wonder if Starship Troopers is a satire of the entertainment industry.  It's said that in wartime, a society takes on the imagined attributes of its enemy. Here, it's soldiers vs giant deadly alien insects: Bugs. Soldiers are like Bugs in that both are part of a collective. A lot of soldiers get killed by Bugs but there's very little sentimentality. It's almost a good time. The society in Starship Troopers is more militaristic than our own - dare I say? more bug-like than our own. The citizens do seem somewhat dehumanized and disconnected from their feelings. Are they more cut off from their feelings, than we are from ours? I don't think so. Well, depends who you are in our society. Watch and decide for yourself if this is an ugly future and if it's uglier than our present.  In the world portrayed in Starship Troopers, at least there's honesty. When Rico's in high school, his teacher addresses the class, &#34;Never forget, the supreme authority, thru which all other authority derives, is the barrel of a gun.&#34; Is this a truth we dare not admit? Hasn't this also become true in our world?
B000OCXMAE|3.0|So like every other LP fan on the planet I've been eagerly anticipating this release. I went in expecting Linkin Park, what I got was a mystery. The album's intro and lead off track \\"Given up\\" showed a different Linkin Park, but one I could appreciate. The hard rock was still there and I could hear a maturation had taken place with Linking Park. However I found myself skipping through most of the album. The only other songs that caught my attention were No More Sorrow and Valentines Day. About the second or third time listening to the album, I opened up to what Linkin Park was trying to accomplish with this album and rather enjoyed it. I thought the use of profanity was unnecessary and also a departure from what Linkin Park once was- they were once quoted saying they didn't believe they had to use profanity to get their point across in their music. Someone must have ticked these guys off. Though I wouldn't put it in the same league as Meteora, Minutes to Midnight is a good rock album once you get past the shock.
B000N3SRRC|3.0|Clutch is my all time favorite band. I have been a fan since 92. I have seen them live 4 times, and have 3 of JP's drumsticks that he handed to my girlfriend at the end of 3 separate shows proudly displayed in my home. So, I feel I have some credibility here. It's always an event for me when a new C! record comes out. I was especially excited for \\"Beale St.\\" Clutch had been on a tremendous role with their previous 4 releases, \\"P.R.F\\",\\"Slow Hole\\",\\"Blast Tyrant\\", and \\"Robot Hive\\". My 4 personal favorite C! albums.  <br /> <br />Right from the get I could tell this one was going to be different. I have listened to it about 5 times now and it truly is. The music is more subdued throughout the entire album. Neil's vocals aren't subdued but they aren't as up front as they usually are. I honestly cannot hear Dan Maines bass. Tim Sult pretty much just plays rhythm throughout. And the almighty      Jean Paul Gaster is used simply to keep a beat. Now you'd think that being done by Clutch this would create a driving wall of sound, But it doesn't.  In my opinion it creates an uninspired sounding record. To me there are 3 signatures for this band that it could not survive without; Tim's guitar, Neil's vocals, and JP's drums. Without any one of these guys Clutch just would not work. To me it seems like JP has been removed from the band on this album. I mean I know he's still there but he really didn't have to be. JP is the back bone of this band and it seems like he was handicapped here. Any drummer can keep a simple beat. And Neil's vocals don't seem to gel with the music as nicely as they usually do. I feel they've lost their edge on this album - like putting a governor on a super charged GTO.  <br /> <br />All that being said I don't hate this album, I could never hate a Clutch album. The first 6 songs are definitely better than the second 6. And \\"Electric Worry\\" is an instant classic and probably one of their all time best songs. In the second 6 there is a song called \\"WhenVegans Attack\\". This song sounds like a Black Crows song to me and that is not a good thing. The day C! starts sounding like the Black Crows I believe is a sign of the apocalypse. My favorite song in the second half of the album is \\"Mr Shiny Cadillackness\\".  <br /> <br />I do believe the record is a solid 3 stars, it's good but I think it is their weakest effort yet. This band is constantly reinventing itself so I am not worried. I really felt the direction they were going with \\"Blast\\" and \\"Robot\\" was the right path. I don't have a problem with the blues influence at all. \\"Robot\\" was bluesy. But I hope they take the governor off and let their powerful engine run rich on their next release.
1594489505|5.0|A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS tells the wonderful, intensely moving story of how two modern Afghan women overcome the great challenges that have faced women in Afghanistan and rise above their victimization. Khaled Hosseini has succeeded in capturing many important historical and contemporary themes in a way that will make your heart ache again and again. Why will your reaction be so strong? It's because you'll identify closely with the suffering of almost all the characters, a reaction that's very rare to a modern novel.<br /><br />In Part One, you meet Miriam at age five as she learns that she is a harami (an illegitimate child). Miriam's wealthy father, Jalil, had seduced a housekeeper, Miriam's mother, Nana, six years earlier and now provides for both of them in a remote shack where he can keep a low profile. Despite his concern about his reputation, Jalil adores the attention that Miriam devotes to him. All proceeds in an artificial and harsh way until one day Miriam decides to demand her father's attention. The consequences shape her world for the rest of her life.<br /><br />In Part Two, the story moves to focus on Laila, who was born to Miriam's acquaintance Fariba at the end of Part One. Laila's rearing is almost totally the opposite of Miriam's. Laila is loved by both her parents with whom she lives and has many chances to develop her knowledge and skills. Laila lives in Kabul while Miriam grew up in the countryside outside of Herat. Laila is beautiful while Miriam is plainer. They also grow up in different times: Miriam is old enough to be Laila's mother. Miriam never had a male friend while growing up, while Laila is fascinated by the one-legged Tariq. All is going well for Laila until the war intrudes to send her life off into an unexpected direction.<br /><br />In Part Three, the two women begin to share a destiny and develop a relationship. Their lives are more fundamentally changed by this relationship than by anything else that has happened to them. The magic of the story is most evident in Part Three.<br /><br />In Part Four, we come into the present, when Afghanistan is once again opening itself to possibilities.<br /><br />The time span of the book is from 1964 to the present. In the background, you are kept up-to-date on political events that shake the entire country. In some cases, those political events turn into revolutions and wars. In many cases, the violence intrudes into the lives of the book's characters. It's like reading War and Peace as adapted to modern Afghanistan.<br /><br />The book also deals with issues of class, religion, sexual roles, child rearing, work, education, and community. These issues are highlighted in terms of the different regimes and attitudes of the controlling male characters. For Afghanistan was a world where the men called the shots, unless they chose not to do so. Although the issues that are raised and the way that they are raised are pretty predictable, it's a tribute to Mr. Hosseini that you won't see them coming. He moves his characters and action around in such a way that you won't see much foreshadowing of what's to come. Part of that skill comes in making each page so interesting and engaging that you are pulled away from thoughts like \\"I wonder where he's going next with this plot.\\" I found myself deeply inside the story throughout. That's rare for me, especially in a story that focuses on female characters.<br /><br />It's early in the year, but I wouldn't be surprised if A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS turns out to have been one of the very top novels of 2007.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and encourage you to discuss it with your friends.

0743455967|5.0|You don't have to enjoy Stephen King's fiction to enjoy On Writing. You simply have to like writing. This book has made it's way onto my must-read list. I have recommended it to many of the writers who have worked for me. It is valuable not only for its insight into writing, but also for its insight into a writer's life. <br /> <br />Stephen King weaves autobiography with a succinct look at the craft of writing. The subtitle, A Memoir of the Craft, is an apt description of what the readers gets. King tells how writing and his life have intertwined, and, in the process, gives us insight into where and how writing ideas are started and developed. If you are even slightly familiar with King's fiction, you will see the initial seeds that formed into his stories.  <br /> <br />I have read the book twice and listened to the audio CD (as read by Stephen King) once. It is hard to decide which I like best. I believe they both have their benefits. The book is worth holding on to and returning to on a regular basis. It is not written as a typical writing instructional book. The abbreviated story of Stephen King's life carries you along as you gain insight into how to write. The CD offers an additional look into the writer as King adds his inflection and emphasis to the written word. <br /> <br />This book is certainly a must read for every writer. But, as King would say, don't let reading about writing replace writing.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|That adage about catching lightning in a bottle seems to apply here.  There was a time that metal was the biggest thing on the planet and everything that came out sounded new and refreshing.  Harkening back to the days of Paul Di'Anno, the punk forces driving the early sound of Iron Maiden made them head bangingly catchy.  It was tunes you could hum, toe-tap, make you move while you were doing something and catch your ear if you were occupied...you would still end up paying attention.   <br /> <br />This kind of pacing and sonic attention-getting lasted up until roughly the Powerslave album.  I'm not saying that things since then are bad or unworthy, they just didn't catch attention or have me humming afterwards or moving with the music.  This album has taken that downwards a notch.   <br /> <br />I didn't find myself even paying attention after a very short while.  The songs, as others have mentioned, are heavily laden with hooks and sequences from previous album's songs and not even the catchy hooks.  As much as I wanted to be positive, I cannot recommend this album.  It doesn't stand up at all well with what the band has had to offer over the years.  As far as the entire IM catalogue, this one comes closest to being their own metallic cure for insomnia. There are some passages in a couple of songs that showed signs of approaching originality and lack of self-pastiche but they are far too few to give the album merit.  And the band's addiction to minor-key drudgery becomes fatiguing.  Remember Sunlight And Steel?  Remember Running Free?  Hello, band?  You are allowed to be upbeat with your metal music once in a while.  This sounds like a band trying to become one of those suicidal '90s goth snore-fest groups.  I don't know, maybe they're getting tired after all those years of life in the metal fast-lane.  I guess you can catch lightning in a bottle, but it only lasts for a few years from your first album.  You can't even hear the echoing reverb of the distant thunder anymore.

B000P2A256|4.0|.....and it's only getting 4 stars cause its a Maroon 5 product. Their 1st album was more genuine, intimate, and way more personal. While this album seems to have big record label producer written all over it. I feel Adam is still trying to write more songs about Jane. But it doesnt seem right at this point since theres been so many years since the 1st album. Like any unresolved relationship everything fizzles eventually and what fizzles here is the magic that isnt on any of these songs that the 1st album had. Overall it is a decent album but not as legendary as their 1st. The 1st single reminds me so much of an 80's song like Holiday by Madonna. It also reminds me of A Public Affair by Jessica Simpson & that single made her entire album FLOP. I am sure the group had alot of pressure from the lable to curn this out quickly & strike while the iron is HOT. With so many years since the 1st release there really should of been more then enough time to write awesome material & theres no reason why with so many years you dont have amazing material. But awesome isnt what we get & this album is like many that plague sophomore album artist. Like Jewel with Spirit & No Doubt with Return of Saturn. It tries to recapture the essence of the 1st album but never does quite what it wants to. Here's to hoping the 3rd album will be back to its original roots.
0446691437|2.0|For someone who doesn't even read that much. I picked this book because I thought it would present some new ideas and maybe help me look at things differently. Not that it doesn't try; but this book isn't for anyone who is already extremely creative and brilliant and can roll with the punches life throws using logic and persistence. I don't think it's a waste of time but it is a little passe for the bright and the modern.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I have been a fan of the Alien movies since I was a kid. I never got to see any in theaters except for Alien Resurection. This is a great set and each movie has extended or deleted scenes added to the films. The first two, Alien and Aliens are great classic movies and the extended scenes make the classics that much better. The final two, Alien 3 and Alien Resurection are the mos underated in my opinion. Alien 3 was a great movie but has alot more cursing than the other three but it fits considering it is set in a prison. There was a bunch deleted from this film and it really adds alot to it as several key scenes are completly different and make more sense IMO. The only issue is that the added scenes have degraded over time and some of the dialouge was unusable so at times the audio is hard to hear, but it is still very interesting to watch. Alien Resurection was the most underated of the four and while it's not the best it is still a good movie. The added scenes really make it that much better. The special features on all of these movies are imense and this is one set that is a must buy for Alien fans and science fiction lovers.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Having seen a limited sneak-preview DVD of the series before it was to air on the Discovery Channel, I really wanted to own Planet Earth since I don't have a TV.  The long distance photography of animals in their natural behavior undisturbed by the cameras is breathtaking. Each episode contains something new to learn because it is presented in such a unique format.  This truely teaches about our planet and is excellent for an ecology class.
0380789035|5.0|I originally bought this book for my husband, who decided he didn't want to read it (isn't that always the way?) so I did. I never had heard of this author and had no pre-concieved judgements about what I might find. And I was pleased at the interesting set up! This is really an interesting book about the nature of religion. What happens when everybody stops believeing in a God? makes you think. Warning! I am a dork, so perhaps that may have something to do with my enjoyment.
630521610X|5.0|By the mid-'90s, the teen slasher genre seemed utterly played out. But in 1996, a seemingly unlikely figure helped resurrect the genre. That man was director Wes Craven, the horror maestro who had himself been largely responsible for kickstarting the genre in the '80s with the classic \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\" (1984). A dozen years later, he directed a new classic called \\"Scream.\\" Written by Kevin Williamson (\\"Dawson's Creek\\"), it's a self-referential horror film/satire that's both terrifying and hilarious. <br /> <br />Craven had actually written and delivered another self-referential, postmodern take on the teen horror genre two years earlier, with \\"New Nightmare.\\" But since that film was the seventh installment in the left-for-dead Elm Street series, it was largely overlooked. \\"Scream,\\" on the other hand, boasted a new story line, more laughs and a hot young cast, and it quickly became a hit with critics and audiences. <br /> <br />Neve Campbell plays Sidney Prescott, a teenage girl still coping with the violent death of her mother a year earlier. Now, a deranged killer is offing her classmates and other members of the community. Worse, the murderer's got his eye set on Sidney, terrorizing her with a series of creepy phone calls. A tabloid reporter (Courtney Cox) thinks the current serial killer may be the same person who murdered Sidney's mom. <br /> <br />Sidney's friends try to comfort her by cracking wise about horror films and offering advice on how she can avoid becoming the killer's latest victim. It may not sound helpful, but it's better than leaving herself in the hands of bumbling Deputy Dwight Riley (the perpetually annoying David Arquette). In the end, everyone is a suspect, and Sidney races to find the killer's identity and save her life. <br /> <br />\\"Scream\\" succeeds as both a satire and a horror film. Williamson's excellent script tweaks every scary movie cliche and asks the question every horror buff wants to know: Why, when the heroine is being chased by the killer, does she run up the stairs instead of out the front door? It's a blast to watch the film's characters talk horror, even as they're being stalked by the killer. <br /> <br />Of course, the humorous self-referencing wouldn't be nearly as fun if the movie wasn't damn scary in its own right. With a petrifying opening sequence, Craven immediately establishes that he hasn't lost his touch for delivering scares. Ferociously acted by Drew Barrymore -- giving perhaps her finest performance to date -- it's guaranteed to leave you whimpering. <br /> <br />From there, the laughs and scares come fast and furious and don't stop 'till the film's knockout finale. While \\"Scream\\" did regrettably spawn a slew of weak imitations (including its own limp sequels), the original is a scary treat you don't want to miss.

B000002G7E|5.0|Most of the comments I've read about the Velvets on this site are surprisingly smart and well done, so check 'em out, particularly with reference to this album of the Velvet's, but I wanted to add a few things.  <br />  <br />When I first listened to this record about 16 years ago (at the age of 16) it freaked me out and I put it aside in favor of Loaded and ESPECIALLY the s/t record (their best, by far).  Those records are comforting and oddly familiar (even on the first listen)... they're just plain brilliant and they are pretty easy to dig, and to get.  But over the years I've come back to WL/WH again and again and it honestly keeps getting better and better and better. <br /> <br />This is the most interesting and the most challenging record in the Velvet's catalog (not Lou Reed's--see Metal Machine Music) and for that reason I beseech you (if you have any interest in music that colors outside of the lines) to really listen to this, hard.  It's not a perfect record, not sure it's even a \\"masterpiece\\", but it's remarkably f#&@%^%G cool and it's fun to get lost in.  I think of it as a document regarding a particular time in American musical history, one that gets ever more relevant as bands like Comets on Fire, Wolf Eyes, The Warlocks and so on and so on, head off deeper into the forest that the Velvets, I'd argue, seeded. <br /> <br />And honestly, The Gift alone makes this record worthwhile--that you get Sister Ray and Lady Godiva's Operation as well makes it a no-brainer.   <br /> <br />

B00004VXF2|3.0|Let's not over think this one too much; this record is a statement of contempt, and it sounds like it.  No one has a gap big enough in their record collection to fit this except the uber-completeist; on the other hand, I do think that everyone should listen to it at least once and to be sure, if you see a CHEAP old lp version of it, buy it.  Personally, I sat in my radio station's engineering studio with a pair of good headphones and listened to both sides completely ONCE when I was 19.  I did my duty to Lou Reed and the record, and my duty is done.  I get it... Next!

B000P46QIG|5.0|It has been five years since Moon Babies came out, and it would be wise to say it's been worth the wait. Instrumental rock, metal and fusion project Planet X are back. Driven by keyboardist Derek Sherinian and drum god Virgil Donati, their new album sees them returning to the composition-based style of Planet X and Universe, more so than its predecessor, which relied more heavily on mindblowing instrumental prowess.<br /><br />Without doubt, the biggest plus of Quantum is that Allan Holdsworth appears on two tracks. Unfortunately, because of scheduling commitments, he could not do the whole album, but fear not, for another amazing guitarist, Brett Garsed, has returned to the fold, filling the songs with amazing chops and his unique legato phrasings. As most will remember, it was Garsed who played on the very first Derek Sherinian album Planet X, which still ranks as most fans' favourites. Both Garsed and Holdsworth are known for their unmatched legato-style playing, backed by killer tone and amazing solos. The two Holdsworth pieces, \\"Desert Girl\\" and \\"The Thinking Stone\\", are wildly improvised. \\"Desert Girl\\" starts out with nice symphonic keyboards and a beautiful piano melody before it picks up pace thanks to Donati's funky playing. It then launches into a fantastic improvised passage, highlighting Holdsworth's talents. Surprisingly, the song is also quite heavy compared to stuff we've come to expect from Holdsworth's solo material, so it's a much welcome change. \\"The Thinking Stone\\" has also some cool tribal drum beats and the guitar playing is mindblowing.<br /><br />The band tests heavier waters on \\"Matrix Gate\\", one of their most complex pieces on this disc, blending busy rhythms with groove-inflected drum and bass battery. Brett Garsed particularly comes to the fore on \\"Space Foam\\", punctuated by simmering synths and big bass. Considering his timing and sense of melody, it is a shame he is still yet to be discovered by the masses. Anything with Garsed rules, so be sure to check out his solo material as well. The atmospheric colouring of \\"Snuff\\" and the playful \\"Kingdom of Dreams\\" demonstrate how such busy and complex numbers can be turned into relatively easy listens thanks to Sherinian's keyboard acrobatics. On bass, both Jimmy Johnson and Rufus Philbot (Al Di Meola) do a great job. The bass is loud and central on pretty much every track, and complements the tunes perfectly. As for Donati, the drum solo on the final track is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Those kick drums are phenomenal.<br /><br />Quantum is going to be one of the best instrumental discs of the year.

It is very different from the original two, incorporating very little of the common themes heard on the others.  The sounds are fantastic - suspenseful, magical, enthusiastic, fun, exciting, and I could keep going!! A must-buy for Pirates and Zimmer fans alike!

B000P2A256|3.0|In a business as predictable as today's mainstream music industry, Maroon 5 has always been an enigma. When they first burst onto the scene in 2002, their music didn't fit in with the rest of what was playing on MTV or the radio. Perhaps that was their appeal. In the midst of emo, pop-punk, and guitar-driven crap rock this band came out of nowhere and reminded everyone what good music sounds like. It's been way too long since that album came out and many fans, like myself, have been clamoring for some new material from this great band. After all that time, Maroon 5 has once again taken over our speakers and our hearts with \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long,\\" an album that reminds us why they were so popular in the first place.<br /><br />Part of the band's appeal has always been their ability to blend elements of jazz, funk, rock, and pop to form a sound that is incredibly unique. \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" continues this tradition, while branching out into other territories as well. It begins with the near-perfect \\"If I Never See Your Face Again,\\" a funky rock song that draws heavily from mid-eighties pop music like classic Michael Jackson. The production value is high, here, utilizing some fantastic samples and infectious harmonies to form a truly catchy pop song. \\"Makes Me Wonder,\\" the first single from the album, has an addictive fuzz-bassline that drives the song throughout. Adam Levine is at his absolute best as he sings the chorus (\\"Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore\\"). The song may very well be the highlight of the album, but at only track two, there is much more to enjoy coming up.<br /><br />Take, for example, \\"Little of Your Time\\" which sounds extremely reminiscent of Outkast in it's production (particularly \\"Hey Ya\\"). It's poppy, staccato guitars are contagious and Levine's performance is undeniably top-notch. \\"Wake Up Call\\" is a direct throwback to their previous LP, \\"Songs About Jane,\\" while \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\" is the obligatory ballad that sounds too much like \\"She Will Be Loved\\" for it's own good. \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" is a hopeful song, but it share's it's hook with Kanye West's \\"Heard 'Em Say\\" (which Levine was featured on). While it may be entirely possible that this song was actually written before Kanye's song, the fact that it's used again just seems incredibly redundant, especially when you consider that it sounds much better in it's previous incarnation.<br /><br />\\"Can't Stop\\" brings back the staccato guitars to form a truly rocking song, but it is followed by the uninspired and cliche-ridden \\"Goodnight Goodnight.\\" The chorus is powerful in itself, when Levine sings \\"Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight...\\" but even then it sounds like we've heard this all before (especially when you consider that the opening guitar riff sounds just like 3 Doors Down's \\"Kryptonite\\"). \\"Not Falling Apart\\" is a decent song in itself, though there's very little that would distinguish it as Maroon 5 apart from Adam Levine's unique vocals. One could easily imagine Kelly Clarkson singing the exact same thing, which isn't really an insult at all. \\"Kiwi,\\" however, is just aching for an insult. The song is filled to the brim with innuendos (\\"Sweet kiwi, your juice is dripping down my chin\\") and even some not-so-subtle sexual references. Like the opening track, the song sounds like old-school Michael Jackson at times; that is until it explodes into an all-out rock fest, complete with an impressive guitar solo.<br /><br />The album closes out with two ballads, both worthy of praise. \\"Better That We Break\\" is a piano ballad in the vein of The Fray, while \\"Back At Your Door\\" is just all sorts of beautiful. It may very well be the best Maroon 5 ballad yet, which is saying quite a lot. Overall, \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" is a pretty impressive sophomore effort from a band that refuses to fully compromise their sound for more success. In an industry that has the tendency to leech onto a specific sound, milk it for all it's worth, and toss it aside for the \\"next big thing;\\" the fact that Maroon 5 still sounds fresh and unique speaks volumes about the talent that this band has. \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" may not be the flawless, magical album that \\"Songs About Jane\\" was, but it's far from a sophomore slump. While some songs should've been left in the studio, there are others that truly make this album worth the purchase.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|When I heard the single What I've Done it sounded amazing and it made me really hopeful for the rest. So when I got it and popped it into my CD player I was surprised. In their previous albums they have been able to catch a mood, a feeling that was easy to connect with and that ran deep. Hybrid Theory was dark, Meteora was more defiant. Minutes to Midnight is about soul searching and shock at the state of the world. <br /> <br />With the first listen I thought it didn't have a strong impact and the lyrics were weak. But I've loved this band for years and I wasn't going to give up on them so easily. I listened to it for a day straight and the more I listened the more the album grew. There's an honesty here, a story, in the past emotions were the main focus, with this we are given a look at what causes these emotions. <br /> <br />The style is very different from the past, yes, but there are layers to each song that didn't come through to me until the third listen, now I can't get the riffs and beats out of my head. <br /> <br />Though I will admit the lines \\"I've never been alone on a Valentines Day.\\" and the screams of \\"Put me out of my misery,\\" are a bit juvenile. <br /> <br />Highlights of the album are: Leave Out All The Rest, What I've Done, In Pieces and my favorite The Little Things Give You Away. <br /> <br />So for those that this would be their first Linkin Park album I don't think you'll have much problem with it, for those who are already fans it'll be a hard adjust but give it a few listens-it'll be worth it.
0393327655|1.0|The end of faith. Sam Harris. 2004. New York: W.W. Norton (paper)<br /><br />This book could serve as a model of hypocrisy. The author criticizes religion on two points. First, religion causes people to believe things without evidence. Second, differences in religious beliefs lead to violence.  The inconvenient fact that anti-religious fever has been the source of much violence, as in communism and Nazism, is camoflauged by including them as \\"political religions.\\" On this definition, Harris' own viewpoint could be considered religious and denounced for exactly the same reasons Harris uses to denounce mainstream religions. First, Harris emphasizes there is a \\"world beyond reason\\" (page 40), and claims that \\"mysticism is a rational enterprise\\" (page 221). Evidence, apparently, is optional in this case. Second, Harris seems willing to kill those who disagree with him. He informs us: that we cannot tolerate diversity in religious beliefs (page 46); that we have lost the right to our myths (page 48); and that it may be ethical to kill people with certain beliefs (page 53-54). To ensure universal \\"cooperation,\\" Harris advocates a world government (page 151). Violence, apparently, is acceptable when used to gain Harris' ends. This book illustrates the sad and self-destructive tendencies of humanistic fundamentalism and shows the danger they pose to a truly free and democratic society.
B00005OWEG|1.0|this film never made any sense to me--simply because this director never lived through any of it and does not get the subject. critics who praise this mess are just as misguided as the guy who made this joke of a war flick. <br />the reason Platoon works for me is because Stone knew what he was talking about; he lived it, spent time in the jungle, was shot at, etc.  <br />what's the use? <br />get it if you like being conned. <br /> <br />the most hated line in the history of the cinema (for me) is \\"I LOVE THE SMELL OF NAPALM IN THE MORNING.\\" <br />I wished someone could have taped the actor's mouth shut for saying something so insidious. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000MXPE7O|1.0|I can appreciate long, complicated movies if the character's have personalities, but unfortunately this is three hours of my life that I can't get back.  I could see how the movie could have been good, and indeed should have been good.  Instead, what we got was a long, disjointed, uninteresting story with even less interesting characters.  I was thankful when it was over and was expecting to see some pretty bad reviews on it when I got home.  Since there weren't many, I took it upon myself to write one.  I'm glad I borrowed it!  This was a big miss for the famous cast and director. What a waste of time.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Fascinating and very educational. I have shared it with others.  The only drawback is that I wish they would have had a section of the DVD that dealt in detail with what we can do as individuals.  Suggestions at the end of the film were helpful, but need more detail.
B00005JPKE|5.0|A dark tale, long and suffering.  Lacking upliftment and weak characters.  Japan lost, this movie tells it like it was, no sugar-coat, nor gloss.  Granted, it takes work to engross yourself in this movie, no one wins, save Kaos and Tragedy.  Even feels good the misery of it is over when it finally ends.  Yet, Eastwood carries us through a tale of mighty fortitude with extreme precision for detail, exceedingly real history you will take with you, as if you would if it was a novel.  This movie belongs high on the all-time best of movie lists.  You have to love a movie that was made with virtually no empathy for the viewer's want for entertainment, yet deeply satifies him definitely.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|After all these years of killer music they did it again. Another amazing state of the art, smart and sign'o the times statement by Mustaine & friends.Ever since the  EMICapitol reissues came out and I been gorging on listening to all the Mega -output including albums I thaught I did not like- you know \\"Cryptic...\\", \\"Risk\\", \\"Hero\\" even \\"Countdown\\", Anyway I have a new savage love of Megadeth, everything sounds great to me now. Including the album before this wich I havent played since it came out. The point is the new album is the greatest in a long line of Killer Metal Quality,Top of the game indeed.....
0375423966|4.0|good book!! it brought me back to my childhood and i realized how much i really do like comics! satrapi is a great author and i can't wait to read her other books :)
B000OCXMAE|4.0|After all the predictions about this album, I am glad I bought it.<br /><br />When \\"What I've Done\\" came out on the radio, it actually took a few tries before the song grew on me and other than one other song on the album, the rest of the music was the same...it had to grow on me.<br /><br />You'll either love it or hate it...your decision.
0802136834|5.0|Although contains lots of history, still very readable and interesting.  I got it because I got hooked on The Tudors on Showtime.  The book is better!
1401207529|5.0|Not the best art in my opinion (after all it is the mid 80's) but, since it is the first bat-graphic-novel I have read I can tell you that it is most definately five-star quality which makes up for the art-style ten-fold. Not everyone may feel the same way about the art. I just like modern-art better. More year 2000 style. But anyway, this is most definately a must have for any batfan. I can see where Batman Begins got its ideas from and if they follow this type of quality they'll rival even the spiderman franchise. And to me that's sayin alot! Definately get this.
0743289684|5.0|I am almost done with this book, and I must say I am glad I got this, it is  eye opening.  To hear of not only the problems in the third world, which are partly explained by poverty, lack of education, but to realise  that sometimes strict Islam may cause them, and to read of her journey to that conclusion is amazing.  She is not afraid to speak up, which why she would be an asset in politics if she should choose.
B000I5XOVY|5.0|All I will say is this film looks and sounds brilliant on blu ray. A must for your collection.
0792843584|1.0|This is the worse movie I've ever seen!  I knew the reviews were bad <br />but I got the movie finally because it was filmed in the area where my wife and I had once lived in a tipi with our three kids while I worked in the woods as a logger back in '78.  Since I had not taken many pictures of the area I wanted something as a record.  The area I worked is where the house of ill repute was ( actually filmed on the North Fork of the Flathead river across from Glacier Park).  Some of my friends worked as extras during the filming.  Anyway my wife and I viewed it some but found it hard to follow...I suppose because of the heavy editing. <br />     Because I have worked on farms, and in the woods, and survived on venison and rhubard, and built cabins, and cooked over campfires... I found the themes pretty silly. The acting seemed to follow some revisionist theory of how things must have been. <br />   If you want to learn about the Johnson County War, research it and read about it...don't bother with this movie. <br />

B000G73U5Y|3.0|They're getting to the point where the repackages are going to outnumber original recordings. The box set gave a couple of rare tracks, this is just an updated \\"Decade of Steely Dan\\" with a couple of recent songs. Until then, \\"Showbiz Kids\\" has everything you could want in a Steely Dan collection, plus Donald's repackaging his 3 CDs in a multimedia release called \\"Nightfly Trilogy\\" next month including \\"True Companion\\", promo videos and an interview.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I love this Two-Disc Special Edition, I especially enjoyed the bonus features on the second disc, it tells how the movie was made, and why the director selected certain individuals to play their characters, including the Phantom.  I am already a big fans of Phantom, but after watching the bonus disc, I appreciate the movie even more.  I really wish I could be part of it.   <br /> <br />On the bonus disc, the only complaint I have is that they do not have subtitle like in the first disc; in my opinion, they should at least have the subtitle for the deleted scene where the Phantom was singing the song 'No One Would Listen'.  Without the subtitle, I have no idea what he was singing about.  It would be nice to know the lyric of this song so that I can learn to sing to it. <br /> <br />Elise Luong
B000P0J02E|5.0|This is a fantstic addition to the Pirates of the Caribbean scores.  MUST BUY!!!  Anyone who loves is movie, or loves Hans Zimmer needs to add this to their collection!
B000QI2ZWW|2.0|First, Robin Williams does too many of the characters.  There are scenes when two of his characters are in the same frame and it seems like his accents merged. <br /> <br />Second, This movie lacks a real plot.  It gives the impression that it is a movie about the penguin getting acceptance for not being like other penguins, but then they add in an adventure that has very little to do with moving the story along.  It does make the movie a lot longer than it should have been.  It also makes you check how much time is left.   <br /> <br />Third, The most enjoyable part of this movie was the mixture of music.  It was interesting how they would take two or three different hit songs and merge them.   <br /> <br />If you have young children who want to watch a cute penguin movie I would look for Scamper the Penguin movie from the mid 1990s.  That is a great penguin movie.  [[ASIN:6303509878 Scamper the Penguin]]
B000001EHS|4.0|This is a great CD. Every home should have one as it contains a slew of hits. It covers their entire over produced era and sure, it rather ineligently sidesteps their first two albums except for a remake of Bringin' on the Heartbreak, but for the casual fan this collection is probably the bees knees. It's the perfect catch all release for radio listeners who just want the hits and a couple of other tunes.<br /><br />And there isn't really a lot of complaints to be made about the track listing. If your a death metal fan you won't find much joy here but for a fan of melodic hard rock and the super smooth production values these dudes were known for then this is a must buy.<br /><br />The only things that may reduce your desire for this album would be a) you already own this stuff. B) there is precious little from their first two slabs - no Wasted or Hello America. If you fall into the (a) category then try to chase down the edition with a 2nd disc with 9 live tracks on it. Given Joe Elliots going on record as disliking live albums these 9 tracks may be the closest you'll ever get to a live album from this band, excluding bootlegs.<br /><br />All up a great round up of the years 1980 - 1995 and highly recommended.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I love this series, but when I purchased it, I expected Sigourney Weaver as narrator as I watched it the first time in America.  The UK version is great too, it just took some getting used to.
B000001DV2|3.0|Kickstarted by the great fun time lead track of Lets Get Rocked things were looking pretty darn rosy for this album. Great vibe, band with a huge profile, a bit of a sympathy vote due to the tragedy that befell them in the death of Steve Clark, I mean what could go wrong?<br /><br />Well for starters overlong dreariness like White Lightning which sounds cool and atmospheric on first listen but is just plain boring on repeated plays. Or how about horrors like Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad? Tripe. Other tunes such as Personal Property and Make Love Like A Man would of sounded OK on Hysteria, they have some groove, but here they lack a supporting cast of really strong songs to prop them up.<br /><br />On this album Def Lepard have come out with a flimsier version of Hysteria. And to drive the point home that this is Hysteria Mk II is the presence of track 10 - Tear It Down. It's a left over from the Hysteria album and was even used as a 'b' side for heavens sake. When you can't even write ten songs for an album and have to trawl through your discards from a previous album then it indicates a problem.<br /><br />Having said that there is some growth here in other areas. The lessened involvement of Mutt Lange was much noted at the time though this is still a very heavily produced album as Mike Shipley and Def Leppard have continued very much in the same vein. But it does mean the band had to grow within themselves a bit. Also the band do deserve somewhat of a thumbs up for their perseverance in the face of adversity of  a very deep and personal nature.<br /><br />In summation this is a watered down, less inspired version of their mega hit Hysteria. As Joe Elliott said at the time to Metal Edge magazine 'we could probably put out an album of bee farts at the moment and it would sell'. Well with the big hit of Lets Get Rocked plus a few other OK lep tunes they certainly didn't stoop to those levels, but this was a big let down to their fanbase at the time. And no amount of rose coloured glasses will change that.d no amount of rose coloured glasses will change that.
B000M53R26|4.0|Wow Im amazed with this cd.  didnt think it would be all that great.  but its great !  Theres only one great debut album thats Trisha Yearwoods Trisha Yearwood ( Its perfection ) This dosentcompare close to it but its a great shot.
B000001E21|3.0|Full points for honesty and integrity on this release. At the time it was put out a sizeable sticker on it proclaimed it wasn't a new album. Which was a nice touch. Also points to the band for having the guts to put this out when many people would of expected just another version of Hysteria - I mean not many bands clear the decks like this. Normally bands foist their 'b' sides and rarities onto fans in some sort of overpriced box set package but the Leps, like Megadeth and a few others, have put out a simple catch all disc.<br /><br />As to the actual songs I'm not going to do a track by track synopsis but will point out a few salient tracks. Firstly there is the opener Desert Song which is certainly musically the heaviest thing to have come out of the band for a while. Fractured Love moves along nicely and in fact a number of the 'b' sides collected here are pretty handy tunes - Ring of Fire and Ride Into the Sun being two fairly well known tracks among Leppard enthusiasts. Sure, I Wanna Be Your Hero overdoes it on the cheese factor but there are upswings like the cover songs Action and Only After Dark.<br /><br />Now before we get carried away lets get some perspective in here. And that means being honest and pointing out that yea and verily the ballads are rubbish. Every one of them which is weird given they've written a couple of good ones over the years, evidently the cupboard is bare in this department. Also some of the zest in these tunes would of been welcome on the Adrenalise album.<br /><br />Brief yet useful liner notes complete this package which along with 1995's Greatest Hits album was a great way for the band to draw a close on the first decade and a half of their career and more ahead with a clean slate. For fans this is good stuff, for casual listeners perhaps the interest won't be there.
0061146307|4.0|After already having seen the movie, I decided to invest in reading the books. Bk #1, THE BAD BEGINNING, only took me an hour to finish, and it was an enjoyable--if dark--read.<br /><br />The Baudelaire children--Violet, Klaus, and Sunny--are left orphaned after a mysterious fire destroys their home and kills their parents. Taken into custody by Mr. Poe, the executor of their parent's estate, they learn that their parent's will states that they must be cared for by a relative. The closest relative, unbeknownest to the children, is Count Olaf, an actor and leader of a theatre troupe who lives in a dilapitated house on the other side of town.<br /><br />Things, of course, only go from bad to worse after the children move into Count Olaf's home, which is strangely covered inside and out with drawings and representations of a strange-looking eye. Count Olaf even has a tattoo of the same image on his ankle. As the Count hatches a scheme to gain control of the Baudelaire fortune, which the children are not privy to until Violet comes of age, the children are alternately scared of their new \\"parent\\" and determined to find a way out of their dreadful situation.<br /><br />I enjoyed this walk on the dark side, and plan on reading Book #2 in the series later today. That said, however, I think it depends on your child and his or her maturity as to whether this would be a good read for them or not. Although the reading material is suitable for around 8 years old and up, the book IS dark-natured, and might scare some children. If they've already seen the movie, they might be prepared for its darkness--if the movie depiction scared them, then hold off on the book for awhile.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Jennifer Wardrip, aka \\"The Genius\\"
1569242739|5.0|I love this book. It allows people like me who are trying to cut our dairy in desserts do so very easily. I have made a few recipes out of this book and no one can tell that they are vegan cupcakes. I haven't had cupcakes in at least 10 years and since I bought this book and since I have made many batches! <br /> <br />I am also not a great cook or baker, so the recipes need to be easy. I find that while there are more advanced recipes, they aren't too advanced to stop the beginner from trying. I get discouraged easily when I see a recipe that looks too in depth.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for animal friendly desserts. You can take these to anyone and they won't be able to tell the difference!
0743243315|4.0|This story follows the lives of a family of Bangladeshi immigrants in London. The heroine, Nazneen, was born in a Bangladeshi village. She was arranged to be married at a young age to a man in London. The novel covers about 15 years and follows Nazneen's transformation from a naive, subservient wife into a strong-willed woman unafraid to make her own decisions. This personal development forms the central theme of the story. Nazneen was raised to have a fatalistic attitude towards life. She learned from her mother that a woman's lot on this earth is to suffer and bear this suffering stoically. Nazneen herself was born stillborn and her mother did not take her to a doctor, preferring to let Allah decide whether she would live or die. This attitude was imprinted on Nazneen at a young age and the story revolves around her escaping this mental straitjacket. <br /> <br />The novel is populated with a number of interesting characters. Nazneen's husband, Chanu, is an ambiguous figure. On the one hand, he is no religious fundamentalist. He fancies himself as a sort of intellectual, and is familar with and has an appreciation for Western literature and philosophy. Despite these modern leanings, Chanu has retained many traditional attitudes. Although he never beats Nazneen and genuinely loves her, he expects her to play a subservient role and congratulates himself for being an enlightened man when he allows her to do simple things like go to the store alone or earn money through sewing. Although he appreciates the contributions of Western culture, he constantly rails against the moral depravity of British society. His dream is to eventually save up enough money to go back to Bangladesh, where his children will supposedly not have to deal with this moral corruption. Chanu seems to be a bit of a dilettante; he is obviously well-read and has accumulated a storehouse of useless knowledge, but he is unsuccessful at business and blaims his failures on real or perceived racism. <br /> <br />Monica Ali explores a number of issues that are central to the immigrant experience. Nazneen's friend Razia has a son who is addicted to heroin. Nazneen's neighborhood, largely populated by Bangladeshi immigrants, has in recent years been overrun by gangs. Ali's novel also looks at how the 9/11 attacks impacted Nazneen's community. An Islamic community group is formed, but members of the group are divided over what they should do and what their tactics should be. The character of Mrs. Islam is a sort of community matriarch. She is old and scrupulous enough to have amassed considerable influence within the community. She loans money at outrageous interest to needy families, and employs her two uneducated sons as enforcers. She knows everything about everybody in the community, and often uses this knowledge of other people's private affairs as a form of ransom. Finally, through the characters of Nazneen's two daughters, we see how difficult it is for immigrant parents who wish to preserve some of their native culture. Chanu's efforts to instill in his daughter's an appreciation of the wonders of Bangladesh fall on deaf ears, as the two have lived in London their whole lives. <br /> <br />Throughout the story, Nazneen receives letters from her younger sister Hasina, who still lives in Bangladesh. Hasina ran away from home to avoid an arranged marriage. Her first \\"love marriage\\" did not work out, and throughout the book she struggles as a single, uneducated woman in a traditional, patriarchal society. <br /> <br />Overall, I really liked this book. It offers a valuable perspective on a number of important issues: tradition versus modernity, the role of women, assimilation versus multiculturalism, individual freedom versus societal pressures, the role of Islam, etc. Monica Ali treats these issues delicately, showing how they are dealt with by ordinary people on an everyday basis. I hope we see more novels like this from people with similar backgrounds. <br /> <br/>There were just a couple of things that prevented me from giving the book 5 stars. First, a good chunk of the book's text consists of letters Nazneen receives from Hasina. As they are written in a semi-literate style, they are not easy to read. I realize that Hasina is an uneducated woman, and the letters reflect that, but these letters simply took me about twice as long to read as the rest of the text. I can think of other authors who have managed to write from the perspective of uneducated people far more fluidly. Finally, the novel contains another plot twist that is rather central to the story. Nazneen has an affair with another man from within the community. I personally didn't think that this element of the story was handled very well, and it wasn't very convincing to me. However, that was just my own perspective and I will let others make their own judgments. Overall, I would recommend this book to anybody interested in the issues mentioned above.
0618680004|5.0|To say the least, Richard Dawkins has tackled a prickly topic here. To question in today's day and age, whether religion is a positive thing, or should even exist, is cutting against the grain - at a bare minimum. It's familiar territory for Dawkins and he does it well. <br /> <br />I happen to agree with Dawkins' premise; I can't accept a different level of evidence in the spiritual portion of my life than I expect and demand in every other part of my life, but even if you don't agree, there are some wonderfully thought-provoking concepts in this book. I also give Dawkins credit for pointing out the ways in which life can be terrifically meaningful even in the absence of religion. <br /> <br />Dawkins makes so many incisive points that it's hard to single any out, but a couple things really stand out for me after reading the book.  First, Dawkins makes the point that he'd love for us all to become sensitized to a child being called \\"Catholic\\" or \\"Muslim\\" or \\"Jewish.\\"  His point is that no child can thoughtfully choose a religion.  He'd like to see a child referred to as, \\"The child of Methodist parents\\" instead.  Not a bad idea.  Second, he addresses a question he hears often, \\"If you don't like religion for yourself, that's fine.  But why bother about other people being religious?\\"  His answer is enlightening; Dawkins sees that religion teaches faith - the ability to believe in something without evidence for belief.  He views faith as a tool that can be used to lead otherwise good people to do bad things.  Dawkins wants us all to develop a passion for seeking evidence and questioning what we are taught so that we can find tangible truths and identify lies told to us by people in positions of authority.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. If you have an open mind, you will find yourself thinking some very big thoughts in the course of reading it. For the first time in my life I found myself contemplating how much more beautiful I find humankind to be because of what I believe it accomplishes on its own rather than at the behest of some unknowable deity.  <br /> <br />Very interesting, filled with smart and novel ideas, very hard to describe. Give it a read with an open mind and it'll give you a broader perspective on many fronts.
1591840562|5.0|This book is a great guide for anyone embarking on a venture or any enterprise (profit or non-profit) for the first time.  Kawasaki goes through all the basics, how to execute them and explains why to do some things and not others.  <br /> <br />Some of this stuff is not relevant to every business or project you may find yourself involved in, but for most (especially the novice) it gives you enough to start seeing the forest from the trees when putting your plans and strategy together.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I want to say first that I love Linkin Park and every CD they have put out to this point.  This CD however is the worst.  To be perfectly honest after listening to the CD it sounded as if Avril Lavigne wrote their lyrics and Good Charlotte wrote their beats. <br /> <br />I mean honestly, how do you go from collaborating with Jay-Z to this?  Also I'm sorry, but the song Hands Held High is trite.  I'm all for speaking out but this smacks of bandwagon jumping. <br /> <br />Just my 3 cents.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|I have to start by saying how desperately hard I found this film to review. It's so complex, has so much to say, and works on so many levels. At the same time, it's not an easy film. It's apparent reading the reviews how much trouble people have had with this film - for any number of reasons. Perhaps they felt it a bit long, and didn't care about what was being said. Perhaps they couldn't relate to the actions and choices the characters made, and didn't sympathize or empathize with them. Or perhaps the film's unusual structure left them a bit cold and disconnected. Whatever the reason, the 3.5 star current rating reflects the majority's inability to really \\"connect\\" with this film. <br /> <br />For those who don't know, Babel tells 4 different revolving stories across 4 countries (USA, Mexico, Morocco, Japan), and how the actions of one effected all of the others. On another level, the Biblical story of Babel was a story of how man tried to build a tower to God. In doing so they were struck down and punished by speaking different languages - rendering their ability to communicate null. Babel takes this idea of man's inability to communicate and creates a film that expresses this idea on a multitude of levels. Whether it's through race and discrimination, cultural differences, handicaps, or through personal anger and estrangement.  <br /> <br />I also find it very interesting that the over-arching idea of communication is told in a backwards but interlocking fashion through the 4 storylines. Starting from the last to enter to the first what we see is: Man's desperate, primal need to communicate with others. This basic idea is rendered in a heartfelt, poignant manner through Rinko Kikuchi's performance of a deaf teenager, and reiterated in many scenes. The separation and isolation from others is driven home through the dance club sequence, and Rinko's sobering exit. The next stage is man forming bonds with others. This is told through the relationship of Brad Pitt andCate Blanchett. This single stage of communication is on the intimate, personal level with another person. <br /> <br />Moving from this we get to a larger stage, in man creating societal groups, and forming barriers to separate from other society groups. This point is driven home by the Mexico/America border scene. This creation of barriers and walls is one that's inevitable as large groups start to form. And it's through this that discrimination is born. The final stage is how man causes harm to others because of these barriers. It's ironic, or perhaps appropriate that this violence is expressed through the actions of children. What better way to show how discrimination caused by separation caused by lack of communication can effect not only ourselves but future generations? <br /> <br />It has been noted many times that the cinematic merits of this film are impeccable, and nearly impossible to dispute. Editing, cinematography, score, sound, etc. are all handled with a true level of directorial mastery. The acting is equally superb. The two \\"big names\\" of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett turn in terrific and (surprisingly) understated performances. They're not given alot to work with, but they bring a level of depth to roles that could've been extremely hollow. But Rinko Kikuchi, as the Japanese teenager deserves extreme praise for her handling of a particularly difficult role. The demands on her in this film are higher than any one else. Throughout all of her scenes she runs the gamut of emotions, and she handles them with a level of genuine emotion and a delicate touch. Even in a film with great all-around performances, she steals the show. Adriana Barraza as the Mexican nanny is almost equally as good as Rinko. Finally, Mustapha Rachidi as the Moroccan farmer is only of lesser note in light of the other extraordinary performances, but is excellent as well. <br /> <br />I find the two storylines of the Moroccan farmer and his family, and the Mexican nanny are the two most difficult. I say this because of the 4 storylines, these were the only two that ended up in the situations they did because of bad decisions. But is it so simple? In the case of the Moroccan farmer and his children, they end up in the situation because of the children being forced to grow up so fast. This is expressed in multiply ways throughout the storyline. Is the reason they end up where they do due to stupidity or just immaturity? In the case of the Mexican nanny, she makes one seemingly harmless decision to take the children she's watching to a marriage in Mexico. But on the way back a series of horrendous events leaves her and the children struggling for their lives in the desert. The scene where things break down at the border is one of the films key moments regarding communication. <br /> <br />It could be the cultural divide. It could be the odd, interlocking narrative. Whatever it may be, Babel is just not going to be a film that's a huge hit here in the USA. It's interesting that this film is about man's inability to communicate, and Americans are particularly bad in that we're too wrapped up in our own culture. If we don't understand it, we don't like it. It really says something that this film has been a huge hit throughout the world, but grossed relatively little here. Films like Crash, Syriana, and the like have garnered much more attention, yet Babel has out-grossed them both world-wide, but not here. Overall I think it will be left up to the individual in terms of how much they get out of this film. If you're willing to look deeper and try to understand each individual story within its context and what's being said, this is a film that will likely really hit home with you. Its resounding statement is how we should really stop and take the time to listen to one another and then go the extra mile to not just listen, but really understand one another.
1419364375|2.0|The first set was not good.  Product was sealed so I assumed it was in good condition.  When I opened it to pack first CD was missing.  I called and after some conversation.  The replacement was shipped.  I received it just before I left on an European trip.  So all ended O.K.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I want to preface this by saying a few things: The only reason I ever checked out Fallen and Evanescence is because I was mesmerized by Amy Lee's voice. She is perhaps the finest young singer out there today, and probably my favorite. Her tone, control, and inflections are just riveting and endlessly dramatic. However, as much as I loved Lee's voice, Fallen - on the whole - was a VERY mediocre album. That statement alone will send 5000 Evanescence fans crying foul with \\"this review wasn't helpful\\" votes, but hear me out: <br /> <br />As good as Lee's voice is, the majority of the music on Fallen was mostly just plain bad. Too much of it sounded like a bland Linkin Park ripoff (as if they weren't bland enough). The sole exception being a really good drummer - the guitars and bass on Fallen were just terrible. I say this coming from a music lover's background. Someone who feels actual music makes music good as opposed to catchiness or a good voice or lyrics. Fallen had great vocal performances in spades, and My Immortal is in my pantheon of all-time great songs. But the rest was just sub-par from a song-writing and musical standpoint. <br /> <br />With all of that out of the way, I get to The Open Door. Boy, did Lee and co. surprise me with this album. I will simply say that everything is vastly improved. It's denser and much more complex than Fallen, without losing an ounce of what made Fallen a success. That being outstanding vocal performances, and the right combination of catchy hooks and darkness. I honestly didn't expect an album like this from Evanescence so soon - an album that will seperate the Evanescence fanboys and fangirls from those who genuinely enjoy music as art.  <br /> <br />Amy's voice has actually grown in leaps and bounds since Fallen. She has learned how and when to mix her haunting, wispy vocals with her towering, belting vocals. Besides that, we have a whole new lot of inflections from Amy, including a dark and almost menacing low register. All of this is combined with perfect control and a highly dramatic delivery that brings to mind opera without being over the top. Speaking of leaps and bounds, the guitars on this album are exactly that. Gone is the puking tone from Fallen's Ben Moody, and here is a tight, \\"dialed in just right\\" metal tone from the much more competant Terry Balsamo. Besides the tone, the interplay between the guitarists is actually pretty good. Nothing on the level of Iron Maiden or Judas Priest, but still darn good for a mainstream band. On the whole, the guitars go from what was an annoyance on Fallen to genuinely enjoyable on The Open Door. The drums and bass also provide a solid backbone and a driving momentum for most of the songs. While perhaps a bit forgettable compared to the rest of the album, they're by no means bad. <br /> <br />In terms of song-writing we hear an artist learning to write multi-faceted and well structured songs that actually go somewhere. Sweet Sacrifice and Call Me When You're Sober rock as hard as anything on Fallen, but both are exceedingly better structured  with some - surprisingly - good, interlocking guitar work. The dark, haunting numbers are equally as accomplished. Lithium builds perfectly into a momentous finale with Lee's voice looming large over the hulking guitars. Like You is as bleak as anything they've done. With disturbing lyrics that match the somberness of the music.  <br /> <br />Elsewhere, the multitude of experimentation works much more often than it doesn't. Snow White Queen starts out as a brooding piece before bursting into one of the best choruses on the album. Lacrymosa might be THE highlight of the album. Sampling a piece from Mozart's Requiem we hear a near brilliant fusion of dire classical and gravely gothic metal. This piece builds from just the strings of Mozart's piece into a colossal finale with grinding, churning guitars and Amy's soaring voice mixing with the Lacrimosa chorus creating a truly dramatic ending. Your Starbegins with a eerie piano bit, before Lee enters with a ghostly like vocal. The song again builds into an excellent finale with an intricate dual piano/guitar melody. <br /> <br />The last half of the album is just as rewarding as the first. This is another differing point from Fallen - which fell apart near the end. The Only One and All That I'm Living For actually match the power of the lead singles, and are perhaps even more satisfying with repeat listens. The album closes with its answer to My Immortal in Good Enough. This is a simple gem of a song. It's not as immediately striking and memorable as My Immortal, but it's equally as stellar. Featuring Amy Lee at her most confessional and restrained, this is a sobering and haunting song. Sounding little like Evanescence's usual goth-metal-pop mix, this song bears more resemblence to R&B. In truth, this is as soulful a song as I've heard in a long time, and as good a vocal performance as I've ever heard. <br /> <br />The Open Door is not all premium material though, with a few generic numbers. Weight of the World just can't match the power of the opening songs. Cloud Nine and Lose Control are also rather drab and one dimensional. This would've likely been a stronger album if those songs were cut, trimming the album from 13 to 10 songs. These few minor grievances cannot detract from what is still a marvelous album. Compared to Fallen, I was surprised by how much better this album got with repeated listens, which is likely due to it being much more subtle and intricately structured. Another highlight is the outstanding production that allows the details (and Amy's voice) to shine. This album sounds absolutely magnificant on my high end audio system, and is one of my favorites to listen to because of it.  <br /> <br />Now, compared to bands like The Gathering and Lacuna Coil, Evanescence still has a ways to go. But as a mainstream band trying to fuse pop and gothic metal, they succeed admirably. What we end up with isan album that fulfills the potential shown on their debut, while still hinting that perhaps even better things are to come. I will say that this is an album that uber-fans of Fallen might not easily get into and like (as shown by the polarizing reviews on Amazon). But I extremely respect Amy Lee for delivering a truely dark, confessional album with many musical highlights rather than a banal remake of Fallen.  If I only enjoyed Fallen because of Lee's vocals, I truly enjoy every aspect of The Open Door - from the vocals to the music and arrangements to the production. And that's as high a compliment as I can give this album.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is fantastic! It shows what they have always been capable of! It is Green Day growing up!!!  It is one album I have listened to again and again for well over a year now and I am still not sick of it!!! <br /> <br />All Green Day fans are different. Some like all their types, others like the older type, and Green Day now has many new fans due to their new style! That is fine! Take it or leave it. I just want to say that their intelligence shows through here and their talent is proven all the more by their ability to produce a new style and pull it off perfectly!
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Once again Wilco have totally changed the landscape of their sound while keeping their musicianship and writing impeccable.  Tweddy's lyrics are straightforward, accessible, and lovely.  All the guitar work on this album is flawless, particularly Nels Cline's.  Every piece of every song is represented in musical perfection.  Tweedy's opening line, \\"Maybe The Sun Will Shine Today\\" is a new beginning personally and for Wilco as a band.  \\"I Hate It Here\\"  is a tale of Mick Jagger and John Lennon if they had settled down in the suburbs(not a bad thing).  \\"Walken\\" sounds as if it were meant to be on \\"Being There\\", but it's too good(and I love Being There). Once again Jeff Tweddy proves he is our generation's Bob Dylan and Wilco is The Band.
B000P0J02E|5.0|This is a beautiful cd especially the last two tracks. A totaly emotional suite. Everyone should buy.

B000MRAAJW|4.0|I watched this series on Discovery Channel when it was broadcast & I thought it was a stunning series, with gorgeous photography. Now that I've seen it in high definition, I am even more stunned by it. It looks fabulous. The section on Mountains is just amazing, as is From Pole to Pole. If you've got either an HD DVD or Blu-Ray player, get this series and be amazed at the picture. I just wish it had the Sigourney Weaver naration instead of David Attenbourough's. He does a good job, but I really like Sigourney.
6304078102|5.0|This movie was  smash hit and got Drifus  the oscar nomie for best actor. This movie was a smash hit back in 1996 making 83 milion in the United Statee and 103 million world wide. For those of you that loved Forest Gummp you will love this movie. This movie will always be the best Drifuss movie ever made of all time. If one teacher could effect that many kids. Then image what the natios of the world could do in real life. They could come together and put aside their petty differecnes and embrace there fellow man and women. I just have one thing to say God bless you Richard Drifus we need more people like you in these year of war aginst the middle east. Mr. Halland oppus show's the courage and purity that lies in the most seemingly difante of souls. That one man can change the lives of millions of people around him. If we can join together and work with each other instead of destroying and put each other down we can change the world and make it a place of peace for all nations. Christian, Jews, Araibs, Muyslins, Mormons, Japanse Athist everything inbetween from Hindu to Vodo. Together we can face overcome odds that would seem impossible to others. As the old song goes I quote\\"United we stand divide we fall\\". I recommend this movie for all ages. There is some mild language but that makes the movie even more phonimal and uplifting. This movie will be an utimate classic for decades to come. Mr Holland's Opus is a real tear jerk you will be laughing and crying at the same time.  This movie will make you want enjoy life or in the words of Richard Driffus\\"Play the sunset!\\"
B000E6UK5K|2.0|I am a long time Pink Floyd fan and have purchased David Gilmores earlier albums.  I was thinking to buy his old stuff on CD format when I saw that he had this new album.  Sorry David, but I didn't find anything outstanding here. I like you but I'd, rather some classic ummagumma or your first or 2nd solo. Thanks anyway.
015603283X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, it's fast paced, the hero is likeable but not loveable and the story is well balanced.  Even though I didn't get all the literary references (mostly European), I did get most of them (I think) which simply enhanced the enjoyment of the book (almost like being in an exclusive club).<br /><br />I do have to confess that I have read all of Dumas' books before I reached 7th grade, he is my favorite author, so to find a book about him was a true joy.<br /><br />This book is translated and very well indeed, and my only regret is that my rudimentary Spanish will not allow me to read it in the original language.  There are very few books which I could say the same, [[ASIN:0060934344 Don Quixote (P.S.)]]Edith Grossman translation of Don Quixote is one of them.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Alright, I'll readily admit this is not their best album. This is probably their worst album to date. But every band goes through a period of time when they 'discover themselves' and change their style somewhat. I still have high hopes for LP, I just hope they return to their roots. That's what they're best at. If they can redeem themselves before their next release (looking way into the future here), then all will be well, and M2M will best be forgotten.
0802136834|5.0|This book is an interesting history and chronology of the court of Henry VIII, his love life and court intrigue.  No wonder Showtime is doing a show about the Tudors; no fiction writer could make this up.  This book helps understand the dilemmas Henry VIII was under, dispel myths about him (and royalty) and creates some new ones.<br /><br />Ms. Weir does a fantastic job of bringing historical figures to life, telling us about the women behind the names with intelligence and zest.  The author is careful to distinguish between fact and fiction, and even more careful to inform the reader about \\"educated guesses\\".
0385733577|5.0|This book is the most fun read I've had in a long time.  It's geared for the young adult, but no matter, it's even fun for old adults.  The plot and the characters will grab you by the neck and not let go until the end, which leaves you gasping for more.  I read it in one sitting, just because I couldn't stop.  Mr Scott's interweaving of multiple mythologies is amazing.  I've been reading fantasy/SF for over 30yrs, and still had to look up a couple of characters.  The use of actual historical characters is brilliant, and opens up a huge context for the future.   <br /> <br />Darker, stronger, perfect for the graduate of the Potter books.  Takes it to the next level in fantasy.  Highly recommended for everyone.   <br /> <br />I want the sequel now.  I wanted the sequel right after I finished.   <br />
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I really enjoy these fine ladies and their singing as well as how David Downes has created their fine blended arrangements. I've got their first DVD and CD as well. This is beautiful singing at it's best. I'm actually going to attend this concert tonight in SLC, so I'm really excited to see them come to our area and perform.
B000P2A256|4.0|I once heard Adam Levine say something to the effect of - 'they have gotten older, and better at playing so the music was going to improve' - that's not a quote but it's the jist of it... and I do agree with that.<br /><br />I was and am still a huge fan of Adam Levine's style of singing and the sound of the first album - 'Songs About Jane'. I too am far past my teen years... So I do look for a little more depth in the music I enjoy these days... While this is a little less than maybe I wanted in that department, I do find it to be a very good album. It is a little more electronic in nature and depends a little less on the strength of Adam's voice and goes more on the strength of the band and its complete sound.<br /><br />It seems to be a great sophmore album and while I hate to take it there.. that is what I am considering when I think about how long it took for them to come out with this album. When you listen to track's from Kara's Flowers and stuff from their earlier recordings pre -Maroon 5- I think you can see the similarities in the sound. Instrument heavy especially in the guitar arrangements. The main difference here is the addition of the strong vocals as was heard on SAJ. It's a combination that was a likely progression in the maturation of the band's sound. They have come out with a new album that is a sound their own.. not a copy of the first album or typical of anything very trendy. It IS Maroon 5.<br /><br />I will continue to love this album and I am glad it has been finally released.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000P2A256 It Won't Be Soon Before Long]]<br />[[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]]<br />[[ASIN:B000AL732W Live Friday the 13th (CD/DVD)]]
031286504X|5.0|What a book! Although the book takes place in a horror background (vampire apocalypse), the majority of this book takes place inside the narrator's mind as he copes with his situation and struggles to find a solution to his hardships.  The ending of this book is magnificent (last three words:classic) and really makes you ponder the advancement of science and human existence itself.  Highly recomended read.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|This is certainly one of the best albums I have ever heard. Every song shows the intesity that Megadeth has always produced. It shows from the beginning that this is going to be a rockin album, Sleepwalker is defintely one of the best intro songs for an album I have ever heard. Gears of War, Play for Blood and Amerikhastan are my favorites with Sleepwalker and the remake of A Tout le Monde is just AWESOME!!! This should be considered Megadeth's finest album in the past several years. I defintely give it 5 stars but I wish I could give 6, no even better: 10!! Buy this album you metal maniacs! You will not be disappointed! \m/ \m/ (Insert headbanging here)
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Oh lord. This is going to be an interesting album to review. Alright, here we go. Take a deep breath and...<br /><br />Well, it's been more than four years since one of the new millennium's biggest rock acts has dropped an album. When Linkin Park delivered \\"Meteora\\" in early 2003, it was still kind of okay to play rap-rock and nu-metal. Emo and indie-rock hadn't quite taken over yet, and people were actually anticipating a new Limp Bizkit album. Like it's predecessor, \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" it spawned several successful singles, prompting the band further into the spotlight and inspiring some money hungry filler-albums such as \\"Collision Course,\\" a mash-up effort with the most active retired rapper in the world, Jay-Z. The men in Linkin Park must have felt like they overstayed their welcome, because not much has been heard from them since 2004. Aside from various side-projects and random concerts here and there, the band remained mostly unheard from, holed away for what seemed like eternity, with the legendary producer Rick Rubin to forge their third full-length effort. \\"Minutes To Midnight\\" is that third album, and from the first listen, it is clearly obvious the band spent entirely too much time overthinking and overproducing this one.<br /><br />Now, let's take a moment to cherish what's great about this album. For starters, whether any Linkin Park fan would like to admit it or not, the band's old formula was extremely predictable and \\"Meteora\\" was in reality, just a continuation of \\"Hybrid Theory.\\" Here, at the very least, the band put their best effort forward to deliver something as fresh as possible and something that doesn't sound like anything they have ever done before. And at times, it really works. Songs like \\"Bleed It Out,\\" \\"Given Up\\" and \\"No More Sorrow\\" do the best job at putting a new spin on typical Linkin Park material, while lighter fare such as the uber-ballad \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\" and the somewhat political, Shinoda-dominant \\"Hands Held High\\" sound like nothing the band has ever done before, and are actually -- gulp -- good! The musicianship on this record is also much more accomplished than before, with guitarist Brad Delson trading in his typical power chords for something a little more subtle and textured. At moments, he sounds like he's channeling U2's The Edge, which makes sense, since half this album sounds like \\"Joshua Tree\\" era ballads.<br /><br />Now let's take it down a notch and look at the negative side of things. For starters, flat out, this is too much change at once. Had the band put an album out between \\"Meteora\\" and this one, the style of this album might be a little easier to swallow. But aside from a handful of songs, this just doesn't sound like Linkin Park, which is going to turn off a good chunk of their fanbase immediately. If you've been holding your breath and raising your expectations for the past four years to hear \\"Minutes To Midnight,\\" you're almost guaranteed not to have a good time and not walk away a happy customer. However, if you happen to be a Linkin Park fan with an open mind, you might not find such lament with this release, and just might be happy to find the band doing, thankfully, something new.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this album is more good than bad. The most fatal mistake is all the fluff they put on the second half of the album. You just might fall asleep during you're first full listen, for all the songs following \\"No More Sorrow\\" are the kind of mid-tempo, pop tunes that negative reviewers have been complaining about all along. Even still, I'd rather have this album than a \\"Meteora - Part II.\\" You have to hand it to them, they have at least done a good job of reinventing themselves and curbing the trends. \\"Minutes To Midnight,\\" if anything, is more retro than it is modern replication. Which means they aren't trying to sound like Nickelback, dress like girls, or bring back hair-metal. And thank God for that.e band has ever done before, and are actually -- gulp -- good!

B00005RG6B|4.0|I was pretty impressed by this DVD - it expands on the Mindcrime story, revealing tiny details omitted from the songs themselves, and provides a new spin on the album. However, I was pretty disappointed with some parts of the performance. There was too much emphasis on showing the band and not enough of the story bits for my liking, but I guess that's just Queensrÿche's video style for you. Tate's overacting, while pretty hilarious the first time through, kind of detracts from the experience as a whole on subsequent viewings. I swear he was pretending to have some sort of halfhearted seizure by the end of Suite Sister Mary - I'm still wondering what he was trying to do. It also seems to me like they pulled Pamela Moore's original recording for Suite Sister, as it sounds, note-for-note, like what was presented in the original album. <br /> <br />I bought two copies of this - one for a friend of mine as a birthday present, and one for myself because I'm a huge geek. Neither of us were terribly disappointed with it, but at the same time, we agree that there could've been a lot more done with such an amazing album. What irks me most was the treatment of my favorite song from Mindcrime - The Needle Lies. What happened to your voice, Tate? Where are the screaming vocals that I'd been anticipating since I ordered this thing? <br /> <br />In spite of all these negatives, this is an amazing performance, and a must-have for any Ryche fan. Seeing the band's original lineup on stage doing what they do best is really a treat, especially for people who were too young to ever see DeGarmo on stage with the rest, such as myself. However, I don't recommend this to anyone who has a limited interest in Queensrÿche, as they'll likely be turned off by the dark story of Mindcrime and the lead singer's antics. Highly recommended for anyone who already likes and is very familiar with Queensrÿche.
B000BKDOB6|5.0|After an evening with friends playing Patti and many other 70's and 60's luminaries this album got a lot of votes.  As we all treat Christianity as a stupidly unfunny joke the opening lyric \\"...Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine\\" followed by a lesbian eulogy to the joys of womankind seemed to work.   Our general consensus was not only that this stands as one of the best 'dirty-boogie' records ever recorded, and one of the most influential in the world of rock, but also that it is exists as a near perfect smack in the face for religious crap in the defence of personal freedom. <br /> <br />So... <br /> <br />Altogether now... <br /> <br />G L O R I A
B00005QY5Y|5.0|'gold' is an excellent album, and probably ryan adams' most commercially-friendly release to date.  if you've heard of ryan adams, want to try him out and need a place to start in his catalogue (which is fairly extensive even though he is barely 33), 'gold' would be an ideal purchase.  none of the first ten songs on the record need to be skipped over, with 'the rescue blues,' 'stars go blue' and 'nobody girl' as the highlights.  while MUCH has been written about his difficult personality as well as his alcohol and drug problems, 'gold' proves his songwriting talent is first-rate.
B000BGH22W|5.0|As a collector of movie soundtracks, it was unthinkable not to get this fourth album of the Harry Potter series. After reading the mixed reviews, I was apprehensive as to whether it would sit on my shelf collecting dust or get a good workout in the CD player. <br /> <br />I own all four albums, and as avid a fan as I am of John Williams, I would have to say \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" rates up there with \\"The Philosopher's Stone\\" (which really did set the standard for the rest of the following albums). In fact, I would have to say that \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" is my favourite. The music is quite simply beautiful and atmospheric. Standouts  are \\"Harry In Winter\\" (this particular track I can't help but have on repeat mode in the car), \\"Death of Cedric\\" and \\"Foreign Visitors Arrive\\". \\"The Quidditch Cup\\" makes me want to catch the next plane to Ireland! And call me old-fashioned, but \\"Neville's Waltz\\" and \\"Potter Waltz\\" are pleasant and lovely to the ear.  <br /> <br />As for the rock songs at the end, I usually bypass them. Some complain about the jarring disconnect between the orchestral aspect of the soundtrack and the loud rock of the end - well, at least they're at the end and not in the middle! And let's face it. How many people would have grumbled that those songs that featured at the Winter Ball were left out? <br /> <br />I've always loved the work of Patrick Doyle (e.g. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\"), and this soundtrack is no exception. He didn't 'fill' John Williams' shoes on this score. He pretty much created a new pair. Harry's story and personality have shifted on. It would be remiss of us to think the music wouldn't evolve as well. <br /> <br />So has this soundtrack lost that feeling of magic? I would have to say a resounding 'no'. It's certainly a lot more listener-friendly than \\"Chamber of Secrets\\"!
B000OCXFCO|3.0|Megadeth's new album, United Abominations, is a good effort but not great. I like most anything Megadeth (even Risk) and only truly dislike one album (KIMB) but the songs on this album are only average.  There are no real memorable riffs and pretty much every song has political lyrics (which grows a beard after a while).  If you're a Megadeth fan you'll surely enjoy it but overall this is more comparable in quality to The World Needs A Hero than Youthanasia or Rust In Peace (or The System Has Failed).
0151013047|5.0|In the weeks after 9/11, the American news media obsessed over the question, \\"Why Do They Hate Us?\\"  I wish I could go back to that time with a case or two of this book. It convincingly portrays a character in love with American power, affluence and style, who nevertheless develops a murderous emnity toward the US. <br /> <br />Hamid depicts the animosity between the west and fundamentalist Islam as a clash of competing nostalgias, each side sinking into its past to escape the psychic trauma of its deteriorating present. This isn't some political screed dressed up as a novel, however.  It is a very human tale in which personal relationships serve as allegories of the relations between cultures.  When people believe the future they face is not one they can live in, tragedy is inevitable. <br /> <br />The trope of presenting the entire text as one side of a conversation in a Pakistan market is tough to pull off, and Hamid does occasionally have to resort to the \\"What's that you say?\\" kind of monologue that feels staged. But the payoff is worth it, as we are forced to interpret both individuals and nations through the perspective of a narrator who doesn't even trust himself and whose friendly banter gradually reveals a treacherous intent. <br /> <br />The criticism that Changez's motivation is insufficiently presented is a mystery to me.  Hamid does a very touching job of letting us feel the massive approach-avoidance conflict of being both seduced and repelled by two worlds, and being compelled nevertheless to take sides. And the romantic subplot, heartbreakingly rendered, reminds us that the political is always ultimately personal.  <br /> <br />I was more moved by this novel than any I've read in a very long time.  I recommend it wholeheartedly, and look forward to Hamid's next novel!
B00005JPD0|5.0|I heard a lot of bad things about D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, with words tossed around like \\"contrived,\\" \\"unbelievable,\\" and \\"Jerry Bruckheimer.\\" My parents, with their big screen television, forced me to sit down and watch the movie at 11 p.m., when I was ready to go to bed.  But instead, I watched right to the end around 1 a.m.  It's that good.<br /><br />D&eacute;j&agrave; vu entails a terrorist attack by a really safe-kind of terrorist, the now almost-quaint homegrown American type who doesn't like America because...well, just because.  Back when we didn't have enemies lurking around every corner, for a brief time America was its own worst enemy, and it's obvious D&eacute;j&agrave; vu was created from that era.<br /><br />Our resident terrorist Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel, who once played a famous carpenter you might have heard of) decides to bomb a New Orleans ferry full of Navy sailors.  The incident is no less horrific despite Oerstadt's unspecified reasons for the attack.  Enter our hero, ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington), invited to join the investigation by FBI Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer).  Since Carlin can't seem to find his partner and has the expertise to \\"examine the data,\\" it seems like a good idea.<br /><br />The plot thickens when Doug discovers the body of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), who appears to have been murdered before the bomb went off.  That's when the science fiction piece comes into play.  The FBI team has a device that allows them to track four days in the past.  Of course, Doug figures it out soon enough--they're not just viewing the past, they're actually experiencing the past.  And if one can experience the past, then maybe one can travel there...<br /><br />This little restriction (only four days in the past, no more, no less) is an important plot twist.  It lends a sense of urgency to an otherwise difficult concept for a thriller.  D&eacute;j&agrave; vu makes the time travel element easy to accept, because the tantalizing possibilities spiral from there: other plot paths tie together (what happened to Doug's partner?) and there's even an amazing car chase where Doug must race in the present to view where Carroll goes in the past. It has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Summaries of this film make much of Doug falling in love with Claire.  But it's a borderline stalker relationship, as Doug knows Claire primarily through his time traveling surveillance.  Fortunately, D&eacute;j&agrave; vu doesn't overdo it; there's not even a major onscreen kiss (more like a peck on the lips).  And that's just as it should be...the events are too action packed, the pacing too frenetic.  Anything more would border on camp.<br /><br />Because D&eacute;j&agrave; vu is always moving, the actors primarily stay out of the way and let the action roll.  There are a few clever lines (\\"We held hands once.\\"), a few bad script rewrites (\\"I need more cowbell\\"? Come on guys, stop trying to be so hip) and plenty of gravely serious meditations on the existential nature of the universe.  But mostly it's about blowing things up.<br /><br />D&eacute;j&agrave; vu is an awesomely entertaining thriller with enough action, enough science fiction, and just enough skin to keep everybody interested.  Don't miss it...again.plot paths tie together (what happened to Doug's partner?) and there's even an amazing car chase where Doug must race in the present to view where Carroll goes in the past.

And that's just as it should be...the events are too action packed, the pacing too frenetic.  Anything more would border on camp. <br /> <br />Because Déjà vu is always moving, the actors primarily stay out of the way and let the action roll.  There are a few clever lines (\\"We held hands once.\\"), a few bad script rewrites (\\"I need more cowbell\\"? Come on guys, stop trying to be so hip) and plenty of gravely serious meditations on the existential nature of the universe.  But mostly it's about blowing things up. <br /> <br />Déjà vu is an awesomely entertaining thriller with enough action, enough science fiction, and just enough skin to keep everybody interested.  Don't miss it...again.

0743496728|3.0|I am always comparing her newest books to \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" and \\"Perfect Match\\"--both 5 star books!  This book just did not live up to either of them.  The ending was abrupt, odd and predictable.  The character development was almost too detailed--it dragged on too long.  And of course the mother would have recused herself before the trial even came to be!! I have to admit, I teared up a few times throughout the book, but it still was a little flat.
B0004Z33G4|1.0|First of all this review is not for the movies (which by the way totally rock!), but rather the horrendous DVD treatment that they receive here.  I was shocked to find that there is not even a theatrical trailer, or anything that would give you insight about the making of the movies.  Instead we are treated to \\"special ops features\\" which basicaly consists of clicking on a title such as \\"rambo's knife\\" and being taken to the scene in the movie where rambo gets his knife, which is often accompanied be useless info on the screen about the knife that can easily be obtained by watching the movie!!!  It is a shame because I have so much love for these movies, and yet I feel like I got screwed with the DVD's.  If I were you I would spend a little more money to get the older OOP DVD's.  Anything has to be better than this.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|Here, Paul Simon is critical of rich white people like himself.    The CD ruminates on the difference between rich and poor, and how the only time the 2 worlds unite, is when rich people go on exotic vacations.  Then, the timeless exotic world, and the contemporary rich world, have some sort of encounter.  Apparently the music is very good during this encounter.
1602831777|2.0|I was really excited to listen to what was described as a salient and dynamic polemic, while riding the train.  i uploaded the disc to transfer to my ipod, and began to listen.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! the voice of the single reader was stuffy and pompous-- a total turnoff.  i wonder if the author had any say in the actor who was chosen.  some people might enjoy the slow, measured, commonwealth-accented speech of the narrative voice, but for me, it was too distant from the congenial, conversational tone that the reviews had described.  i haven't listened to this since the first day i took it out of the box.  maybe i'll still read the book, but i'm disappointed that i spent my money on this product.

B000P2A256|3.0|Maroon 5 return with the follow up to their hugely successful debut \\"Songs about Jane\\", and are off to a good start so far, with lead off single \\"Makes me wonder\\" (in a similar mould to \\"This love\\") already #1 on Billboard.<br /><br />It was always going to be tough to top \\"Songs..\\" and they don't. However, they continue in the same rock/pop/funk direction as their debut, though this time around the songs don't jump at you immediately.<br /><br />Other standouts (besides the incredibly catchy \\"Makes me wonder\\") are \\"If I never see your face again\\" (great guitar intro), the upbeat \\"Little of your time\\", the equally energetic \\"Can't stop\\", the more midtempo \\"Not falling apart\\" (with a nice chugging bassline), the Michael Jackson-like \\"Wake up call\\", and the ballads; the \\"She will be loved\\" clone \\"Won't go home without you\\", \\"Goodnight goodnight\\", and the retro sounding \\"Back at your door\\".<br /><br />But even these don't come close to the standouts from \\"Songs..\\" and that's the problem, a lack of catchy songs and nothing new. There's nothing here that we haven't heard better from their debut. A very good case of playing it safe. The album will no doubt sell in the millions.<br /><br />P.S. Look out for the bonus tracks some of which are better than some album tracks;<br />\\"Infatuation\\" (lovely ballad)<br />\\"Until you're over me\\" (catchy upbeat number sung in falsetto, both available on the Australian edition)<br />\\"Figure it out\\" (a mellow to raging funk/rocker with nice kettle effects)<br />\\"Losing my mind\\" (nice rock ballad)<br />\\"Miss you love you\\".
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Maiden fans the world over were thrilled with the news that the human air raid siren, Bruce Dickenson was returning to the band.  In addition, the new millennium version of Iron Maiden would feature a three guitar lineup of Dave Murray, Janick Gers, and Adrian Smith.  The possibilities were enough to make any metal fan salivate and the happy news was that the reunion album \\"Brave New World\\" lived up to all of the hype.  I really love this album and think that it ranks right up with the best of their classic stuff.  The band takes a turn toward progressive metal yet still retains the patented Maiden sound.  The triple guitar attack is massive in scope and chock full of great harmony solos and leads.  The rhythm section of Harris and McBrain are as solid as ever and Dickenson's soaring vocals are the icing on the cake.  The lyrics are pure Maiden metal covering subjects that fans of the band will already be familiar.  The album starts out really strong with the first three tracks, \\"The Wicker Man\\", \\"Ghost Of The Navigator\\", and the title track \\"Brave New World\\" kicking things off in fine form.  The album's two long epics \\"The Nomad\\" and \\"Dream Of Mirrors\\" are both good, although not quite up there with some of the band's classic longer tunes.  The rest of the album is all solid as well.  My one minor problem with the disc is that the band has gotten into the habit of repeating the chorus of their songs over and over in some cases.  This seemed to have started during the Blaze Bailey years and continues here on a couple of tracks.  If find it mildly annoying, but maybe I am just being picky.  Overall though, this is a great comeback effort from one of the all time great metal bands.
B000002UAO|5.0|Whenever I listen to a Beatles album, I feel like I'm being swept away to some distant land. The music honsetly moves me. My first exposure to the Beatles was their greatest hits CD, 1. I loved it so much, that I had to hear some more. I was recommended by my friend to get Rubber Soul.  <br /> <br />As I said in the title I was absolutely mesmerized. It honestly sounds like a greatest hits CD, but it's just a regular album! John Lennon and Paul McCartney are absolute geniuses. Some of the standout songs for me were: <br /> <br />\\"Drive My Car\\": The album opens with a bang. With their glorious harmonies, this song to me was an instant favorite. <br /> <br />\\"Nowhere Man\\": Again, the harmonies in this group are impeccable, as shown brilliantly in this track. From the a cappella opening to the poignant lyrics, this song is deffinitely one of my favorites. <br /> <br />\\"Girl\\": Just a laid-back, gorgeous tune. One of the highlights for me. <br /> <br />\\"I'm Looking Through You\\": My favorite parts in this song are the sharp staccatos in the guitar. Classic. <br /> <br />I'm still relatively new to the Beatles. This is the second album I've heard of theirs, along with the greatest hits one. If their other albums are anything like these last two I've heard, I'll have plenty of new music to listen to. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I would recommend this album to anyone who likes to listen to some good music. <br />

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This album was my first exposure to the Beatles. I bought it a couple years ago. I can honestly say that it is possibly one of the best albums I've ever heard. EVERY single song on the album is good. I can't think of one that's bad. If I HAD to pick some favorites I'd go with \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", \\"Eight Days a Week\\", \\"Paperback Writer\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"All You Need is Love\\", \\"Lady Madonna\\", \\"Something\\", and \\"Let it Be\\". But for me, it's like splitting hairs.  <br /> <br />I recntly also bought another album by the Beatles: Rubber Soul. I thought that it was absolutely amazing. I'm surprised that none of them made it onto this CD. But then again, it's just their #1's, so I guess I can't really fault them with that. Well, all in all, If you're like me, and you want to get into the Beatles, this album is a great place to start, you won't regret it. And then, if you really like it, I would also recommend Rubber Soul, which doesn't have any of the same songs.

1932100660|4.0|This book presents health-based arguments for adopting a vegan (no animal product) diet.  Campbell is a PhD nutritionist who did much of his early research in the Philippines, where he was working on a project to make more protein available to poor children. He observed that liver cancer was most prominent in the children of more well-to-do families, those who had more access to protein.  This observation made him start questioning the hypothesis that diets that are rich in protein are healthy for humans.  Over the years, he conducted many more research projects on diet and nutrition, and concluded on the basis of epidemiological studies that the less animal products a human consumes, the healthier the person will be.  This book summarizes many of Campbell's observations concerning correlations between the consumption of animal products and diseases, including heart disease, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, autoimmune diseases, kidney disease, and eye diseases.  It also includes a history of events detailing how Campbell's work was apparently systematically suppressed in the scientific literature.  At the back of the book are extensive endnotes pointing interested readers to the scientific literature to verify the facts.<br /><br />The arguments presented in the book are rather intriguing.  If Campbell is correct, then by following his dietary recommendations, we could lick heart disease, cancer, and other common killers in one blow.  That sounds wonderful, to be certain.  But the manner of presentation in the book comes across as a bit over-the-top.  If he's so right, why was his work suppressed by so many?  The very inclusion of the history of suppression of his work in this book tends to make me question his credibility.  On the other hand, he certainly has excellent qualifications and did publish in the peer-reviewed literature, so perhaps he's on to something after all.  Certainly, the diet he recommends in the book, which entails eating all the fruits, vegetables and nuts one cares to eat, while avoiding fats and animal protein would be a healthy improvement over the average American diet.fruits, vegetables and nuts one cares to eat, while avoiding fats and animal protein would be a healthy improvement over the average American diet.

B00004XMTJ|4.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber is a true genius.  He has taken T.S. Eliot's \\"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\\", a loose collection of poems, and has added characters and songs to create a cohesive story.  This is a \\"staged\\" production, as opposed to a \\"stage\\" presentation.  As such, there are aspects of it that are both positive and negative.  For those who prefer live theater, you may be a bit disappointed.  For those who just enjoy the music and dance, you will not.  This format allows for greater instrumentation in the soundtrack as well as permitting some special effects you can't see in a live stage production.  The bonus features give some insight as to the process behind the project as well as introducing a few of the performers.  Overall, this is a very nice production, despite the exclusion of the story of Growltiger.  Was this a move for political correctness?
B000NVIXFK|2.0|This is the first Rush release I don't like. I totally agree with all the other negative reviews about this album. Neil has already written these songs before, only they were much better. Songs like Roll the Bones, Ghost of a Chance, and Freewill have very similar themes, but are both musically and lyrically superior to anything on this album. The lyrics on this album simply depress me; what a downer. There's no ebb and flow to the music. The songs just chug on and on without ever letting up. The listener never has a chance to breathe. I'm either exhausted after hearing these songs or I simply drift off and start wondering what I need to buy at the grocery store. Rush seems to have forgotten how to craft a song. I listened to Power Windows the other day and the difference in quality is striking. The lyrics on Power Windows are thought provoking and the music is uplifting. Alex' solos used to send chills up my spine. Now they just meandor around with no direction. The lack of keyboards on this album really causes the songs to sound disjointed and muddy. The keyboards kept the songs tight, giving them a real clean sound. The band was once able to blend several melodies into a beautiful and cohesive whole. This is what made them technically superior to any other band out there. Unfortunately, this album lacks everything that made Rush great.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|Just happening to catch this little gem from the 80's recently on cable, all the memories flood back from the original airing on ABC when I thought: \\"So, what's the big deal?!\\". <br /> <br />Having known someone who saw the film in a preview in Lawrence, KS and having been told about the people in the audience sobbing hysterically, I was expecting so much more that I got when I finally had the opportunity to see it for myself. It is only the context of history that now lays bare the hilariously tacky overacting and absurdly ridiculous plot that obliterates  Kansas City, but spares the ICBM fields from any strikes, which in reality would have been the converse (in other words-Buh Bye, Lawrence). Not to mention the embrace of the idea of a local skirmish culminating in a 'bolt from the blue' nuclear attack on the US. <br /> <br />All the bunny huggin' liberals writing the glowing reviews of this film also bring me back to the 80's, when the very same no-nukes crowd went absolutely crazy during Reagan's brinksmanship with the (now FORMER) USSR.  <br /> <br />This is a quite dramatic, and suspenseful film nonetheless, but to me represents the zenith of the 80's anti-nuclear movement with a masterfully executed attempt at affecting public opinion through production of a straight propaganda piece. Contextually, a great historical snapshot of the opposing side of the strident debate about deployment of the Pershing II in Europe, the MX missle, the 'leaked' planning studies for the aftermath of WWIII, and Reagan's hardline position against the Soviets, all of which scared the bejesus out of the aforementioned bunny huggers. <br /> <br />Of course, with twenty years now in the rearview mirror, the USSR fallen, Reagan vindicated, and after a massive nuclear build-down, it only serves as punctuation to this film, a nice little postscript of historical perspective to complete the circle begun in 1983. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br /> <br />

B00005JPCF|2.0|Happy Feet is a movie that does a lot of things right, and just as importantly, a number of things terribly. Although I was entertained watching this movie, by the time it was over I sat looking at the tv asking myself what had just happened. <br /> <br />Graphically, this is a beautiful movie. I was somewhat surprised that the animators didn't make the penguins a bit LESS realistic. There's nothing wrong with how they animated the penguins, but with the exception of the baby penguins, they're really not cute. Thinking of other movies like Flushed Away, where they can make mice cute, you'd think...well, I don't know. There's nothing wrong with how they did it, but there were downsides to their choice in animation, in that it was really hard to tell one character from another. But that's a small complaint. <br /> <br />My real concern with this movie is the writing. There are a number of things in the movie that just don't seem to fit. The whole \\"what's happening to all the fish?\\" question seemed tacked on. There's a basic rule to writing a story that you need to have a well-established theme. With a childrens movie that rule is VITAL. You not only have to make your theme well-established, but it can't be overly complicated, as well. This movie started out seeming like it would be about acceptance and friendship, as Mumble (the main character) was an outcast because instead of being able to sing he dances, which is forbidden. But then the movie didn't really seem to know where to go. Sometimes Mumble was accepted and everybody around him danced, and other times he was rejected. Then he gets chased by a seal for no apparent reason, and the way that scene ended you thought, well, maybe this seal is going to be the bad guy in the movie. But he never appears again.  <br /> <br />And then, all of a sudden, the movie takes such a stupid twist that I can't help but say it RUINS the movie. There was never much direction to the movie in the first place, but it just gets BIZARRE in the end. On the DVD box there is the statement, \\"Mumble embarks on an epic journey and ultimately proves that by being true to yourself, you can make all the difference in the world!\\" Now, call me crazy, but if you're going to embark on an EPIC journey, I would think that journey would have to be what the ENTIRE MOVIE was about. Take Finding Nemo, for instance. Nemo disappeared, and the father spent the whole movie trying to save him. <br /> <br />Instead, in this movie, that \\"epic\\" journey begins in the last twenty minutes of the film, and is HORRIBLY executed. I don't mind suspending disbelief in a movie for the sake of enjoying it, but this was just stupid. In fact, the end had such a dream-like quality to it, I kept waiting for Mumble to wake up and have everything be how it should be. Once it was over I literally stared at my tv and said \\"Huh?\\" <br /> <br />It's not even so much that the movie took a strange turn that bothers me. It's that by taking that turn, it COMPLETELY stops caring about every part of the plot up to that. The girl Mumble likes is literally kicked off the movie (and when it happened I thought they were just joking around...until she actually left), the penguin gods have NOTHING to do with anything, and a number of small details were never really dealt with. It's not so much that there are loose ends left untied, it's that there are ultimately a lot of small details that end up having NO relevance to ANYTHING in the story, and end up feeling...extra. The very fact that Mumble likes to dance...which is a HUGE theme in the movie...was never really executed well. I understand that they tried to sell the \\"by his dancing he was able to get people to stop fishing and polluting in his homeland\\", but it's just so hard to swallow that.  <br /> <br />Now, to be fair, there are a number of things this movie did well. The Mexican penguins were an absolute RIOT. I laughed out loud at a number of things that they did. There was quite a bit of humorin the dialogue. The song and dance numbers were well-executed, as well. But the movie ends on such a sour note that it's hard to look past the conclusion and like the movie for its good things. <br /> <br />One other strange thing was Robin Williams' voice EVERYWHERE. He voiced at least two, if not three different characters. I think he did a phenomenal job, but still that stuck out to me. The only role that he really needed to do was the Mexican penguin one, the others were unnecessary. And the rest of the voice actors just don't feel right. Elijah Wood doesn't seem the right for Mumble; Brittany Murphy speaks in a high-pitched whisper, and the rest of the voices (save Robin Williams) are forgettable. Overall this cast was underwhelming. <br /> <br />I don't know. The storyline of this movie is all over the place. There are so many paths this movie could have taken, and I believe it chose the absolute dumbest one to go by. The most basic rule of writing any story is to have a STRONG conclusion. That's the part that people remember. Likely, kids who watch this movie will accept all of it, and that's fine. But I can't believe how poorly this movie was ultimately executed.
