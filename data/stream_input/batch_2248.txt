B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun, very interactive! Me, my cousin, and brother love it! Is a great time burner and gives us something to do on car rides! :)
B008NW67E0|5.0|probably my favourite all time record and performance at present. These guys are unbelievably good and love the CD. Well worth the purchase
B002BWP49C|5.0|Everything came when and as promised.  Thanks.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Game is fun and takes time, though like most free games certain items which are requirements for the little side quests that pop up need to be bought with real life money. Also if for some reason you don't log onto your tablet for a day you come back to your horse being at zero health and happiness. The training to compete in the higher levels takes days to do which can get a little boring. The ability to find friends is nearly impossible so certain side quest sit on your dash forever. Would have liked it better if you could choose your horse at the beginning instead of the default light brown.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|This game is very fun, but if your kindle or any other device dies your file gets erased so I would not suggest spending money on monster life like friend stones gyms or coins.<br /><br />Pfairchilds
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Saw my husband playing it on his Iphone at the housing authority and decided to try it myself. The game while it takes a while to get things moving is a great way to kill time and it is super addicting. I always feel weird when I'm telling people i'm trying to destroy the world. What makes it better is unlike most games in the kindle it is not an internet game so you can play it anywhere.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I will recommend this series to all my friends. It's been a long time since I was so 'into' a good, story and /or series. Can't wait to see more. All the characters are perfect in their performances.
B009O2XY12|1.0|This game had a lot of potential... but it flopped so hard.<br /><br />You play each round by an energy point and you can only have 5 at the time and if you lose a round or get less than a 2 star score you lose the energy point and don't get one back.. so eventually on the harder rounds you run out and have to wait several hours to play again. There is also the inability to cycle balls even if it is just to the one behind it. You can have a whole section of a few colors and one at the very top that is one color... you will get the next eight in that one color and since you are limited to how many balls you have.. you waste most of your balls just trying to get a color you can use! It is good when a level is frustrating.. but this game is infuriating.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game  is cool and fun<br />I play all of the time but could get more coins faster I really like it
B008OOYALE|4.0|While there isn't much to actually DO in this game other than breed and collect money, it can be fun at times to see what breeding gets you. But like most &#34;Free&#34; games it's only free to a certain point than you need to start spending real life money to get anywhere. Certain dragons needed to breed for a quest can only be gotten for hundreds of gold bars..<br /><br />You can only expand to a certain amount before you need a friend to help via a map.. or buy it for gold.. so if you want to have more than 5 habitats you need to start paying real life money which you get to five very quickly.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I had always made fun of the Twilight Saga and never ever thought I'd like it. I finally, one night, decided to watch Twilight. Then, I had to watch them all. Then, I ended up owning them all on DVD - and buying the books. I've read how some people think it's creepy about Jacob imprinting on a baby. I see absolutely nothing creepy about it. He wants to protect her, there is nothing sexual about it whatsoever. I've also read about the disappointment that there was no battle at the end. Didn't bother me either. I enjoyed the build up, but maybe it was because I had already seen Breaking Dawn 2. I just think it was fantastic. I mean, yeah, we aren't talking literary genius here. But I tore through it, as I did the others.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is incredibly addicting, as well as unbelieviably cute.  However, it is very slow paced, as actions take hours upon hours to complete, which can be a little depressing at times.  With patience though, this game is definately worth downloading.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Really enjoy this author read a few of her novels now and I must admit there is some creativity to them and will continue reading her novels as they at put out, worth checking out.
B008602KQI|5.0|I think it is a great movie.  Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic.  She is a down to earth person, and it shows.  Hope she dosen't get caught up in all the Hollywood hype, and go off the deep end.  If she stays focused, and real, a lot of new adventures awaits her.  She would be great in &#34;SnowWhite and the Huntsmun&#34; if there's going to be a sequel.  If there is to be another Twilight&#34;  with Bellas daughter, she would be good.  She has great acting abilities.
B007SGM084|3.0|First book was okay but by the end of the second we get it you like sex and it was the same scene and Scanrio drawn out page after page so I was bored by the end of this series for sure but I did complete it as I hate to leave books and series unfinished
B009O2XY12|3.0|IT WAS OK BUT IT KEEPS WANTING YOU TO PURCHASE MORE. I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TO PURCHASE SOMETHING AND NOT KEEPING HAVING TO ADD TO IT FOR MORE MONEY.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this. Good story and well acted. It had a great, fun vibe and was a lot of fun to watch.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Perfect ending to a perfect saga. Would love to for the saga to continue maybe with Renesmee and Jacob. But leave all the characters of course.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love period pieces and can not wait to see season 3. I definitely recommend this series.Good character development, and story line.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|Overall for me it was a pretty good movie. The plot had an interesting build up and kept you watching. Some parts dragged on, and for me were unnecessarily long and boring. And other parts left you thinking \\"What the heck?\\" I don't what to spoil anything for those who haven't bought it yet, but for those who did see it, what was up with the tooth??? Anyway, I like it and think its definately worth seeing, just wasn't my favorite.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I went from 5 x 5 to 11 x 11 in one day! Better than solitaire as it is far more challenging though it begins easy enough that my 4 year old niece finishes them.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I don't see why everyone is so against this app. I love it! It gives a really organized system for note keeping. Although I don't personally use it, you are able to upload photos, audio, and locations pretty easily. At first, it may all seem overwhelming when you download the app, but once you figure it out, its really great! Scroll past all of the negative comments and you will see a lot of people agree with me. I haven't had any privacy problem at all, and heck, its FREE, so there is nothing to lose really.
386521584X|5.0|I love these photos and the time in the US that it captures.  Robert Frank was a master at capturing real life.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really like this. It took a while, had an actual story and a lot of little challenges other than hidden objects (although it does have a lot of those). Kept me engrossed for hours. Ran well on my Kindle Fire.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Was a good story, but just did not have the same spy like action, more like a typical Hollywood action movie.
B005HPY8LU|2.0|Other than the two main hit songs this album was not worth purchasing. The rest of the selections were extremely repetitive in style, content and rhythm. There's only room for so much negativity in the world. \\"Breakaway\\" was a far superior effort.
B005OZE9SA|2.0|It took the manufacturer a really long time to update the drivers.  Prior to the update, this unit was mostly unusable on a Mac.  Now, it is better, but far from perfect.<br /><br />I suppose that this unit works well for an entry level sound card, but it still suffers occasional dropouts, and the latency remains horrible (about 27ms).  If you are in the market for a sound card and budget is an issue, you can probably make this unit work so long as live performance into your DAW isn't your goal.  The next option is an RME Babyface or an Apogee Duet 2 at 4 times the money.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game has a cool gravitational concept that is very fun and relaxing at the same time.  I highly recommend this game!
B004LWZW7O|4.0|This movie is in no way perfect, but it has a really cool concept. The story is interesting and relevant, and I think there's a lot to like about it. I enjoy it.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|liked for adults, not for children though..bat experience a bit scary, and also violence. however overall it was nice movie.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|The writing on this film is great, but the performances are what stand out most. It's truly beautiful and well done.
B00002ND77|1.0|Should have tested this DVD when I received it. Could not complete an assignment for school due this morning because of this poor product. It's scratched badly and will not play on any computer or DVD player I have. Can't return it since it's been too long. Thanks a pile for the extra stress and hassle!
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|Great movie for animal lovers of any age.  A combination of cool animation and surprising comedic moments.  You will love it!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I'll admit, I'm a bit of a sucker for books which revolve around some grand puzzle -- and as such books go, this was excellent.
030758836X|1.0|I overlooked this book initially based on early reviews, but 2 friends begged me to read it.  The story goes back and forth every chapter to Amy or Nick and it's aggrivating when they change chapters.  It's very long winded and you can scan many pages without every really reading them.  The ending was the most disappointing.  I invest all this time into this book and to have an ending like this one is ridiculous.  BE FOREWARNED--THE ENDING IS NOT REALLY AN ENDING.  My guess is they will try to make a sequel, but I won't be reading it.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I did not care for the movie.  I guess with all the reviews about it and the books, I expected more.  I did not care for the book either. It was nothing like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter books or movies and I loved them but not this one.
1616550414|5.0|I purchased 2 copies of this book, one as a gift for a friend and one to raffle off at a local fandom meet-up. I enjoy the Zelda series, but did not have any intentions of personally owning the book, as I figured I could give it a once through and pass it along- but after looking through my opinion changed. The pages are heavy and beautifully printed, the colors are vivid and as an artist myself, and a fan of concept art, I absolutely fell in love with this book. If you are a die hard Zelda fan this is a must, but even if you just fancy it a bit or like art books this is a very worthwhile purchase.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wanted to make sure to read this book before the movie came out, and so glad I did. Once I started I couldn't put it down.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much! The love that developed between Hachi & his master was beyond heartwarming. Wonderful entertainment for a GREAT price.
B00AUA67GQ|3.0|I like it for quick hand written notes.<br />I use it in meetings instead of typing on a keyboard, I use my stylus to take notes.<br />It has a keyboard mode as well, but I haven't used it yet.
B004QX07G4|2.0|Just didn't care for the book, if I wanted one liners I'll watch her show. I guess I thought there would be more information about her life and show.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Love this app.  Really easy to make various sketches.<br />If I could wish for more, I'd add a zoom in & out feature and add some background options.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is one addictive game. Great graphics and control. And best of all it is freee ppl. Recommended for all ages
B009EAO38C|5.0|After watching the PBS special I had to have the album-excellent, even the grand kids like it. Puts classical music in a new cataqgory.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I live Dean. Colleen I love all you books. The amazing thought put into it. I can't wait to see this in Dean's P.O.V.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|After watching the specials on TV I needed to have this in my collection. Perfect for backyard listening along with a cool beverage.
B004G606K8|5.0|Wonderful story telling, I must have read this book dozens of times over the years and I still enjoy it.
B001GF7WRW|5.0|The product is excelent!!  The sound is great and is very confortable, i like the long cord too and the product's size, is perfect
B007SGM084|1.0|I would like to read a book that at least is able to use<br />the correct spelling and use of English spoken<br />words.  The word &#34;saloon&#34; should have been<br />correctly used as &#34;salon&#34;.  There is no such word<br />as &#34;woken:.  The correct use should have been<br />&#34;awakened&#34;.  I found the book tasteless and &#34;sex&#34;<br />so overused, it became monotonous.  Penelope Bronger
B004I744AS|5.0|I cannot believe how much is offered in this simple app. A great resource tool with interesting interactive features that facilitate learning new words.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|I like to finish movies. It was good. Its been consistent through out. I like. I like the actors to continue the same.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Its Awesome And They Have Great Updates That Give You More Editing Option For Your Pictures Like..Crop.. Collage..Color..Teeth Whiten..Etc. It Awesome...
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Fast free and fab! Great app for people who like Pet Shops! Make your town ,get pets,and help people!Perfect app for fun!
B00A11AN6O|4.0|I like the way you can get all your music from all you mobile PC, tablet and phones  I will keep<br />for a while
0785163174|5.0|Very comic book but also human. A great story with adventure and suspense. A worthy addition to any comic collector.
B0015442YU|4.0|even with the change of one of the main characters this series is still awesome.  I'm just missing one more movie before I have the complete series.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|The most gripping part of this book is how sorry you feel for the main character to see how crippled she is by her OCD. I liked the book, but did not LOVE it. There were some interesting twists and turns, and it did build up to an interesting climax, not quite what I expected. The plot moves along quickly, making it something easy to read within a few days if you're a nighttime reader like me.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because in play in on a kindle and it is a little hard due to the small size.  I wish is it geared better to a smailler tablet.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I have Loved this series. I would highly recommend it!  I currently am getting the episodes as soon as it is aired and have been very happy with it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|absolutely fantastic game gets you hooked in the best possible way and can keep you entertained for as long as you play.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Been using this app for a while now. H Have tried many others, but they don't compare. the predictions truly do save a lot of time....
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|What more can i say? It's a cut above the rest as far as graphics are concerned & the game play is just as nice. Brave was nice graphic wise, but game play was very cheezy.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|My hubby bought this without my permission, and put it on my Kindle! What's the matter with silence?! Peace and quiet?! The world is full of noise.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I chose this rating because this is a great book. I love it this is my second time reading it.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Not much actually happens in this book after the first chapter. The rest is all memory or internal debate, and it would be really easy for a book like this to get boring or repetitive. However, the writing style keeps the pace flowing smoothly and even allows for a few laughs in between all the heartache and trauma. I'm not sure I would ever read it again, but I still really liked it.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|Very true to the story. The four parts was split up very nicely and the end of each one made me want to click play on the following.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! It's a great killer and an awesome way to discover new things. Works great on the original kindle fire.
0345472322|5.0|very enlightening and an easy read... brings new concepts and awareness to the fold...a must read for anyone who dares to venture into how we see things
B003E2UQMS|3.0|The screenplay of the movie was far better and crisper than the novel's story. On the whole an average read.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|What a great story, great characters and a silver lining ending.  Not sure if I want/need to see the film!
1616550414|5.0|Ive been a fan of legend of zelda since I was a kid, this book is a must have for any fan. Great artwork and info covering everything zelda related!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|What a hero.  I can see this as a movie with Jim Broadbent and Judi Dench!  Should be mandatory for all pre-retirement men - and their wives.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book is definitely an inspiration and a must-read! Francine Jay gives great reasons and ideas, on deciding to declutter and simplify our homes, as well as, our lives. I'm all in! I can't wait to get started! More on my review of Francine Jay's book can be read at teatimewithtiffany.com, \\"Still De-ciding to De-clutter... Again, or Part Two...\\"
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My 4 year-old loves angry birds plays it all the time and I play it once in a while to.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Smart moms know why kid's minds grow, with sweet pickles! This game is so good I will add the necessary number of words required to post that I like this game.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|After a while you become bared with the action since the film is seriously lacking in an entertaining story line.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I have read Karen's Highlander series and loved those books. I was a bit apprehensive about this series, because what is the chance that an author can write two incredible stories? Well that's exactly what happened! I read all 5 books in 5 days! Karen grabs the audience and never lets them go until the end. I still want more Barrons and Mac! Loved this series, read it!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I love minecraft. But its way too expensive! Block story on the other hand, is free. Please make minecraft free!!!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Overall, this is a good book if you are a person who likes to analyze yourself and the people around you.  I did end up skimming parts because these parts weren't interesting to me. I would have given it a higher rating if it wasn't for that. Overall, it is a good book which will make you think!
B005IT0V8O|5.0|Students of all ages should have this book. I have an electronic copy on my kindle, but my Son was required to obtain a copy for a high school course. This book has been used for many years, and with good reason. I wish it was updated to include email structure.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a great game, and really tries your thinking skills.  The levels continue to get more challenging.  Hours of fun!
0143113100|4.0|This book was difficult to read and comprehend at first. As I continued down the path of recovery, I understood more of the terms from the book. Caretakers and survivors should read this book to better understand what can be done to recover from a brain injury.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I was laughing my butt off playing with Ben!  My son found it very entertaining.  Ben talks really slowly, and it's SO FUNNY!
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|it took forever to load and once it did it said it was not responding must force close it was retarded that's all I have to say about this app I would say more but it wouldn't work so I don't know
B002ZG97LK|5.0|My daughter loves it.  Don't really know what else to say... it was a present. I will purchase movies again.
B00001OH7O|3.0|Im not going into the details about this album, we all know this is a masterpiece, but rather, im gonna dig my nails into the sound quality.<br /><br />HORRIBLE. DO NOT buy this version, the mastering and sound quality in this version(s) are really horrible, the album in noise reduced. The best sounding versions are the RCA, which is why they are so costly. So I wound recommned the Rykodisc ones. These sound great, not as beautiful as the RCA's, it still has great sound. If you have the money to spare, go for the RCA's... if you need something affordable but that still sounds fantastic, get the Rykodisc ones.
159420229X|5.0|Really great read and a complete perspective into how the mechanics of human memory works. I would recommend this book.
B00BMVTTJ4|4.0|Excellent movie.  By far better than most fantasy or sci-fi flicks made in the last decade.  Unfortunately, it is a bit too oriented toward kids.  It does not follow the book faithfully, but that's ok.  The book had very little action.  This movie had a lot of action.  Unfortunately, no blood.  Even lopped off heads are clean and dry.  Which is incredibly stupid.  But the action is intense and enjoyable.  Very innovative and visually spectacular.<br /><br />Sometimes the film does not take itself seriously.  The dwarves are akin to Snow White's 7 from Disney too often.  I had been expecting Jackson to make a grittier, realistic, foreboding tale of Bilbo's discovery and the dwarves' heart-wrenching quest for their home.  But sometimes the dwarves are silly.<br /><br />Rhadagast the Brown was a turned into a silly twit with comedic timing and stupid expressions.  In the books he is a mysterious wizard like Gandalf!  Nobody knows much about him.  Give us some cool wizard whose magic is at one with the forest and the elements.  Not some dope out of a Disney cartoon!<br /><br />The opening scenes with old Bilbo and Frodo are superfluous--a bit boring.<br /><br />1) The action scenes are fun and innovative, but no blood.  And, yes, sometimes you cannot see what everyone is doing.  But these scenes are worth re-watching.<br /><br />Funny, because each of those dwarves should have been spotlighted in combat sequences choreographed for their characters.  The actors are more than up to the task.  The dwarves are each so different and interesting that Jackson truly could have characterized each dwarf through action.  But the movie failed to make any of the dwarves special, in my opinion.  Except maybe Thorin and Kili.<br /><br />2) The settings and character make-up and costumes are all excellent.  The movie is beautiful to behold.  The effects are often very realistic.  Only the Goblin King is a stupid kid's movie creature.  He even jokes as he is dying.  Very poor writing at that moment.<br /><br />3) The acting is superb.  No one does a bad job.  No one.  Even the extras are truly entertaining and in character, whether standing around or in action scenes.  This Bilbo is the true Bilbo.  Forget the one from LOTR.<br /><br />4) The soundtrack is excellent, moody, appropriate.  Even the stupid dwarf dish-cleaning song is actually in the book, so that is ok, I suppose.  Still hard to bear, when you are hoping for a serious movie.  It's cute.<br /><br />Anyway, there is much more to praise than hate about this film.  Overall it is a beautiful action film that Tolkien fans HAVE to own.  It has its mediocre parts, but these are well-done mediocrity far above most of the drivel Hollywood pukes out all year.<br /><br />So with love in my heart, I say give it a watch.  It is often brilliant.  If you are a fantasy lover, BUY IT.that moment.<br /><br />3) The acting is superb.  No one does a bad job.  No one.

B008OOYALE|5.0|Love this game.  Can't wait to get off work just so I can play it. My son and I enjoy hours together playing and creating it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really love this game because of all the different birds and I have found it more enjoyable then the regular Angry Bird.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book kept me engaged and anxious at the same time.  It was well written and suspenseful, it's characters beautifully developed.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I wish I could have watched this on 3D but I did love the fact that it had a caring about each other story.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|Good start to the show, hoping the action will pick up a bit.  Worth checking out a few more episodes.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Like the game, but hard to manuever.  Graphics are great and wish that it had a joystick, but no that ain't happening!
B004JK61K0|4.0|Works on my device when the main app wouldn't work.  Does a pretty good job getting my email on the Kindle Fire.
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|Very different from the Stargate shows I am used too, but in a good way. The change to a much more dramatic tone was hard to get used to at first. I was not expecting the &#34;BSG&#34; type black sci-fi when I started watching this. I love the casting each actor/actress does a fantastic job, and I find myself starting to care more and more about what happens to them the more episodes I watch.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|I would recommend this movie to all music lovers. It was a great look into a AMAZING man.  One love forever.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Very thought-provoking novel.  Incredibly insightful. Charlie Gordon is incredible! What an amazing story about the many facets of our humanity.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Love this series/story line.  Watched it years ago and it hasn't lost any of it's charm.  Addresses social issues that continue to plague humankind today in most societies.  Slower pace and lower production quality than we're used to now, but worth the effort to overcome.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|For years I was told that &#34;Logan's Run&#34; is a classic and that I should see it.  I wanted to see it, but never took the time to rent it, or buy it, and didn't want to spend the money either.  Being able to watch it free with Amazon Prime is great!  Now I know what people meant when they said I should see it. It was made a while ago, so the special effects aren't great, but the story and the acting are outstanding. I would recommend this to anyone.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Good script, well developed story with Star Trek historical reference points that are acceptable for the major characters. Some license is taken, however, overall the movie doesn't stray too far and remains believable. In summary, an entertaining science fiction movie with lots of action that should provide fulifllment for the Star Trek faithful.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I love science fiction, have read some of the best and this book did not disappoint.  Personally, it's been years since I've read any science fiction that was so engrossing and entertaining. By the last chapter I was throughly hooked.  Well done!
B0051T47NQ|4.0|If you like films that pretend to be documentaries, this is a good one. But unlike The Blair Witch project, it isn't quite so bleak or murderous.<br /><br />As a mostly-Norwegian person, I decided to watch &#34;Troll Hunter&#34; because it's the only time I ever came across a film from Norway, and I figured it was high-time I actually learned something about the country my ancestors called &#34;home.&#34;<br /><br />I went into it with low expectations, but I ended up liking this movie so much that I bought it for my fiance as a Christmas present, and showed it to my mom, who has always enjoyed a good Troll story. She thought it was okay. Which is pretty much what she thinks of most movies.<br /><br />But, in all honesty, I thought it was funny and suspenseful. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who's willing to watch a movie with subtitles.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book is easy to read and keeps me turning the pages.  The gentle humor is refreshing and the style is charmingly understated.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|I'm not generally a big fan of Ben Affleck. He was good in Good Will Hunting, but not a lot else. Well, this is one of those rare gems where he did a fabulous job.<br /><br />I enjoyed the script, the acting was good, and it wasn't predictable. I really wasn't sure what the characters would do or how it would pan out at any point.
B008VBYN80|5.0|It is graphic good and fun to play. Build your own city and army, defend your kingdom. Grow grops,listen to your people, visit friends.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Season 2 of Game of Thrones was even better than Season 1. Not a single bad episode. I've watched every one of them 2 or 3 times by now and I can't wait for Season 3!
B008EK91XU|3.0|I enjoyed the writing in the autobiography and was surprised that Ian Thorpe could produce such beautiful prose. I loved the first chapter with the analogy of being one with the water.I believe he was a gifted student and is obviously able to think clearly and justify his reasons for making life changing decisions.<br />However, the book was just too technical for me. The references to number of breaths, working muscles, arm movements above and under water and all the associated physiology refences didn't interest me.<br />I am sure it would be a great point of reference for swimming coaches and students.<br />I was glad I read the book though and have a new respect for sports people coping with media pressure.<br />I also love Ian Thorpe. He is an interesting mixture of philosopher, sportsperson and  fashionista.<br />If you want to improve your swimming style or learn how to process decisions, read this book.
B00170I7GG|5.0|I love this movie. Bill Murray at his best, and that's saying quite a lot.<br /><br />If you've never seen it, it's time to get out from under the rock where you've been hiding and take a look at this classic. Funny, sad, touching, and all-around enjoyable, this movie is the kind you will watch again, and again, and again.
0399246665|5.0|These are MUST-HAVES for 1-4 year olds! I love these books, and my son loves them also! Great for spending time together and creating conversation :)
B00013M6NK|3.0|The battery has worked fine for about 2-1/2 months so far. It charges reasonably quickly and lasts as long as the original battery that came with the camera, which is a Nikon Coolpix P510.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great love story. You need to have an open mind when reading this book. E L James did a wonderful job writing this love story.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is a great modern day version of the Sherlock Holmes stories.  I am a fan of this type of television and love most of the Masterpiece Theatre presentations.  I think that the actors portraying Sherlock and Dr. Watson in the series are a good balance.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|This is a great album with upbeat songs that are fun to listen to.  The lyrics are positive, and the tunes will make you happy.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have always watched my friends play this game on their kindle or I-pod.Now that I've played the game Subway Surfers I realize why they love this game so much.
B008Y7XNAK|4.0|If you are a fan of Arnold, you'll enjoy this movie. It's got everything you'd want in an action movie, fights, guns, explosions, a cute girl an quirky humor.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so awesome! I recommend it to everyone!  It is additive so make sure you have an hour before you play it.
B000A0K2JO|5.0|Still have an older computer with only 2 USBs, so using this I can hook the keyboard up to this connection and save the USB for other uses.  Works well.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone for those looking to have a laugh and enjoy what you are reading.
B003E6LC6I|4.0|I love this series, Season 1 grabbed me and I'm addicted.  I can only watch on my Kindle Fire while on my elliptical - gets me to want to work out!
0761158464|5.0|i wasn't crazy about this 3-D book, but my grand nephew was.<br />He is entralled by the Star Wars stories and the book makes one come to life when it moves<br />from one scene to another.<br />He can pretend to be the one making things move.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I am an avid reader, and read books that enhance my spiritual relationship, but also convict me. This book fulfills both.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game.  It's my favorite solitaire app.  If you down load this game you will not be disappointed.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|Very good for teenage daughters with eating disorders. Would recommend to everyone to read, very informative for parents of such children.
B003B02O3C|5.0|I loved this book.  John Grisham's writing is such a treat. He draws the reader in and you are lost in this wonderful story.
0375851569|5.0|It's Dr. Seuss...in a box...with more than a fox...and my son thinks its is better than a Cat in a Hat eating Green Eggs and Ham and he gets his Hop on Pop time before bed to read about one or two fish.  He loves it all.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|after i passed level 129 and accessed most of the second puzzle pieces.. only needed one more to complete it.. and i had gathered almost all of the full prize collections the  &nbsp; game closed out, and disappeared from my device.  very sad and frustrating and no one to contact for support.  tried downloading it again and hoped it would pick up where i left off but went back to level one.  the claw game is even worse.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|This not disposable pop music.  It is surely pop music with memorable melodies and marvelous hooks. But it is a very dense record.  I didn't really get it listening on my mp3 player. Too much nuance--especially the amazingly creative guitar work. The record really needs to be heard on an actually stereo with real speakers and air for the music to move.  On multiple listenings it unfolds itself.  I know everyone keeps saying it is Bowie's best since Scary Monsters. I see no reason not to agree. But probably it is better to hear it as its own thing.  I highly recommend this for anyone who likes to live with a record for a while and dig deep into its craft and its mysteries.  That Bowie makes a record this good this far into his career is tremendous testimony to his talent. Challenging,rewarding,essential......
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|By far one of the best games ever made. The music is so relaxing and I could sit and play for hours. I got it for free as the app of the day but I would have no problem paying the $2.99 for it, it's worth it.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Have you all not heard what classic British musicians are doing lately? From Paul McCartney to Rod Stewart to Eric, they are doing what they have always done, and part of what got them where they are today - doing what they want without being pigeonholed in one genre. Paul jams with Nirvana in studio and on live TV at the same time his easy-going standards album is winning a Grammy. Rod has put out multiple standards albums, but still rocks out on tour with Stevie Nicks - Eric is doing the same, in fact this is the most J.J. Cale sounding album he's done, a sound that he's displayed for years on various albums. Has a little Jimmy Buffett casual vibe, too. I dig it.<br />  And have you not heard track 4. on this album? It is the funkiest, bluesiest, rockingest song I've heard in a long time - one that could rival \\"The Core\\" from Slowhand...<br />  Anyway, give THE MAN a break, sit back and enjoy this, and realize blazing riffs and solos will probably be in the future again, if he chooses.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the Bible App has become my favorite app! I love the reading plans available and feel it helps me stay on track of daily devotions!
0811876373|5.0|This book is fantastic.....I wish I would have bought it BEFORE I bought the cake pop maker.  I'm so excited to try these.  Very well illustrated, lots of pictures, and very helpful tips.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book takes you to a place where you never been before , it gives you a point of view from a totally different mind . I love this book I can't wait to see the movie . Pat is one great guy!
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I think at this point they're beating a dead horse. What started out as a great movie with the first one as turned into let's follow Milla around while she wears tight cloths, shoots guns and looks beautiful killing zombies. No real story to speak of and the plot makes no sense.
1433523922|4.0|My order was everything I expected.  However I didn't know the Bible would weigh 6 pounds.  Still very happy with it
B006RJTEIC|5.0|I've always loved this movie. Not the greatest special effects but still a great story. Michael York and Richard Jordan never disappoint.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow. This book was awesome. The pacing was perfect. I just could not put it down.Howey is amazing. He has invented a world that fully captivated my imagination.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better. Very different than the comic so it keeps you guessing. This show is the best of horror survival.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I'm not a big Sinatra lover, but his hits are good and this album covers them all.  It's excellent to have on in the background while working.  I love live albums and this doesn't disappoint, especially considering the industry legends who made this.  Sinatra, Count Basie, and Quincy Jones all together.  Pretty awesome.
B00BESLT6G|2.0|They took everything wonderful about the first movie and destroyed it. If I hadn't paid to watch it I would have turned it off within the first 10 minutes.
B002ZFOMAW|1.0|I would not recommend this book.  My book club chose  to read a classic that no one had  read before and needless to say...only a few actually finished it.  Dry, and boring.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Way to kill a classic. No Mars! If you love the original DON'T watch this remake. Paid to watch and it was not worth the 5.00 to see it. If you must than wait till it's free.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I played this game on a second generation (non-HD) Kindle Fire,  in Casual Mode because that's what I prefer.  I had no problems downloading or finishing the game.<br /><br />This game, like all Big Fish games I've played, has more hidden object scenes than I would like, but I have pretty much come to accept that such scenes will be part of many point and click adventure games, and that some people like them.  The hidden object screens here aren't too bad.  After you complete one, you get a useful object which is identified with a caption, and which then goes into your inventory.  Oddly enough, objects that you pick up otherwise in the game go into inventory, but are not so identified.  This gave me one or two problems because while most objects are pretty identifiable, some weren't.  One in particular I thought was chalk, when it was something else entirely.<br /><br />Speaking of inventory, sometimes an item would not work the first several times you tried it.  If you really think you're on the right track, and it isn't working, make several more tries before giving up.  Sometimes this seems like a glitch in the game and sometimes it's part of the plan - you have to keep hitting something with your (for example) hammer multiple times to get the desired result.<br /><br />There is a fairly useful hint system, and it's hard not to come to rely upon it.  Clicking the hint icon will usually tell you, without penalty, what direction you should go.  If you select the icon when there's a more specific action you need to take nearby, it will direct you in that way, but then take a while to recharge.<br /><br />There is a a separate hint system in the form of a map attached to your notebook, which is on the lower left side of the screen.  This shows all locations you have visited, and also tells you which locations have available actions in them.  It would be wonderful if you were able to \\"send\\" yourself to these remote locations by using the map, but it's not interactive.I say that it would be wonderful because this game, like many others in this genre, runs you around back and forth, getting objects on one side of the landscape that you need to use many screens away.  In one part of the game, the convoluted path you needed to take to one location the first time was skipped in your subsequent visits (which was helpful).  In another part, you were required to take the long path every time.<br /><br />While I usually try not to use hints too much, in the Big Fish games I've played, you don't always know exactly where the next hidden object scene is sparkling, hiding an object you need to continue.  The hint button and the map will spare you from at least some unnecessary  travel and searching.<br /><br />The graphics were good, the puzzles were difficult enough to be interesting.  If you get really frustrated with a puzzle (and there were a few that I decided weren't worth the aggravation) just wait a bit until the \\"Skip\\" button charges and you can get what you need and move on.  The general navigation was good, especially the fact that the game would warn you before you were going to back out of a screen, so you weren't always accidentally leaving a room because you were trying to click on something.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the game.  I still like The Haunt series best of all, and also the Alawar, Fire Rabbit, Fire Maple, and MumboJumbo games, but Big Fish is growing on me the more I play their games.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it for family viewing. Story line was good and entertaining. The graphics are fantastic.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|It took a few chapters to really catch on to who was who and what was what but once you get over the initial introduction of the characters, the book gets better and better. I definitely recomend it!
B000002LAC|5.0|I like the mixure sounds and the old sounds brought to the new. Have done any more cds as a team will look for it on anazon
B007A4SDCG|5.0|In my  20+ years as a practicing professional artist, I've read a lot of books on creativity.  Everything from &#34;chant three times a day&#34; to &#34;write every morning&#34;.  This is the first practical, day to day book of what it takes to be creative. In painting, writing, business, child rearing, you name it, this book works for it.  And that's the beauty of this book.  It's about WORK. Not airy, fairy, stare are your navel and hope the god of inspiration touches you.  Nope, none of that b.s. here.  Just plain, simple, straightforward work.  Get up every day and do your work.  Stop whining about it and do your work.  Stop waiting for the gods to bless you with the next best seller.  Go to the studio and make stuff.<br /><br />They tell people when they want to get into a fitness routine to put out their workout clothes the night before.  And then get up and JUST DO IT.  This is precisely what Steven Pressfield covers in this book.  And it works.<br /><br />Just read it. You'll be glad you did.
B00004YA66|5.0|Jim C before Person of Interest - when his smile wasn't broken.  Loved the story - loved Dennis Quaid.  Interesting and full of suspense.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A great collection of accounts from people all over the world (post Z war).  It's good because it gives insight into all the cultures, and how they fought the war on zombies.  Hopefully the movie closely follows the book.  I like Brad Pitt as an actor, and he rarely does bad movies.
B0044C5SCU|3.0|If I were twelve, I might like it.  Seems reminiscent of 'LOST.'  Run out of fresh ideas, make up something more unbelievable to keep folks watching.  I choose to turn it off.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|My husband and I think Emmy Rossum is so talented and have enjoyed seeing her and hearing her wonderful voice in the movies &#34;Song Catcher&#34; and &#34;Phanton of the Opera&#34;. This CD is just fun to listen to! It will make you smile!
B0049985XW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. It is right there with African Queen. I recommend this and his other movies to all who like this genre of films.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Have seen kids playing this on ipads in stores. If they can do it I can do it. Ha!  Not an easy game. I very quickly got tired of losing. Loaded and runs well on kindle fire. Still trying to decide if I will keep it.
B0001MIQHQ|1.0|I love the Movie, but it was in the wrong format so I had to send it back. This is one of my favorite \\"alternate universe/time slip/house of doors\\" type movie (Came out the same time as \\"House\\" and \\"House 2\\", etc). I can't give much of a review, however, since I couldn't watch it (wrong region). The vendor was very good about making it right, but the overall experience was a real letdown (NOT the vendors fault).
B000IEPFCG|5.0|En realidad todo llego bien y es un muy buen equipo lo recomiendo fue una entrega rápida recomiendo al vendedor
0545265355|5.0|I had heard from a couple of my friends how great these books were so I finally decided to read them. They were so much more than I expected. With all of the cliffhangers, I could not put any of them down until I was finished. These books had my emotions changing constantly! I felt like I personally knew the characters! These books take you to another world that is so far beyond exciting. I believe they were written very well and I could read them over and over again!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I could be biased since I like Zombie/apocalypse type movies, but this show kicks ass.  I can see how people can get turned off by some of the slow portions of the show. But once you are invested in it, like me, you can easily enjoy those parts as well.  Sadly, my wife doesn't watch it. I couldn't even get her to watch Breaking Bad.  Oh well, I just have to go solo when everyone is in bed :)
0446547573|5.0|I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks and his books get me every time. Safe Haven was a good changed from his previous books that I have read. I love the danger and action that is thrown into this amazing love story. Although some elements are very similar to some of his other books, that is one of the things I love about it. The suspense kept my eyes glued to the pages until the very end.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Kinda ...... I don't know boring I guess is the word I'm looking for:(.  :( :(:(:(:(:( so Boring very very very very very boring.
B00BKTWBMA|1.0|Even though I had little optimism that this release from Eric would showcase some inspired and passionate music, I listened to the samples just the same. And I was correct in my assumption...it's just another by-the-numbers throwaway from one of the all-time greats who should limit his playing to his family and close circle of friends if this is the type of material that \\"inspires\\" him these days. I found it impossible to listen to.<br /><br />Not much else to add except that I learned my lesson back in 2010 when \\"Clapton\\" was released and didn't make the same mistake twice; my comments at that time easily apply to \\"Old Sock\\". And judging by the consensus here, I'm certainly not alone. Perhaps a more appropriate title would have been \\"Old Suck\\".
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|She could watch it all day, every day!  And it's not the worst for parents either (though I'd take memo!)
0062073567|5.0|I am a big fan of the author and I have read all of her books. This is really one of the best crime novels, with a good plot, characters and setting. The writer never disappoints,however there are some stereotype characters it just flows with the story. If you are interested (after reading all her works)for future read I would recommend; [[ASIN:B004E3XI8A Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks: Fifty Years of Mysteries in the Making]]as I am reading this at the moment and a must for all AC fans.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|But I loved this book.  Discussing how each nation would handle such an apocalypse was a work of genius.  a little slow in the middle, but satisfied by the end.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I bought this DVD after watching the TV series. It's just the perfect escapism on a rainy day. I have also read the book before the TV series and have to say like the DVD much better.<br />The actors are perfect for the roles and the storyline keeps you entertained and leaves you wanting more.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the story. Nicholas sparks has a way of pulling you into the story. What a surprise ending  awaits the reader.

0316228532|2.0|After reading the Harry Potter series, I expected a bit more from J.K. Rowling in The Casual Vacancy. The book is based on more realistic issues in the small town of Pagford such as politics, corruption, and wars within a community. The plot starts with a member of the city council passing away, and the struggle of filling in the position escalates to secrets and scandals being publicized. For some readers the similarities between this plot and reality is the reason that they continue reading, as for me, I believe Rowling should stick to writing in the Fantasy department.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|Although I have read most of the tales, there were some I had not. I enjoyed this book very much and recommend it to any one who loves mystery and intrigue.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it a lot. I like the 3 d feel which is better than first. Also like choosing ppwerups after coins are full.

B00A2LFXVI|4.0|Great finale to the first part. Lots of action and plenty to keep you interested. The guy playing the jokers voice seemed like an odd choice but other than that....enjoyable!
1451695195|3.0|Very powerful experience to go through and come out of whole in mind and body. I believe the reality of his experience but am not sure I agree with his conclusions concerning the source and location of the spiritual side. Quite a mixture of new age and the occult and God. Wouln't recommend it as proof of heaven. Definitely proof of other demensions in operation. I could be wrong but I didn't have a right feel about the book therefore would not want to pass it on
B008RV5K4U|4.0|Pretty awesome movie. Some of the voices felt off but if you can look past that, this is a great movie. Never read the comic it was based off of but kind of interested now after viewing this. Peter weller did a great job as batmans voice
B000LB7G00|5.0|Excelente Product, very. entrega a tiempo y en perfecto estado. recomendado ciento por ciento. Gracias Estare pendiente de las promociones
B00A3K2PZA|5.0|i loved everything about this movie except for the ending. The ending was truly a wtf moment. some enjoyable scenes within this movie. Great acting from matthew mcConaughey. also a pretty good nude scene. Pick it up if you like any of the actors in it. They all did well in the movie.
B00BKTWBMA|3.0|There's a lot I like about this album.  But the other reviewers are right that if you are looking for Clapton's most powerful and stinging guitar work, this isn't the album.  For that, I'd recommend the superb double live album with Stevie Winwood (Madison Square Garden) in which they cover their tunes from Blind Faith and Traffic and Clapton takes long and inventive guitar solos.  For his best blues work, listen to From the Cradle or the original John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers album.<br /><br />But, having said that, there is a lot of good music on this album in the style of his last release and his work with J.J. Cale.  The music is mellow, melodic and playful with tasteful solos.  A couple of cuts verge on parody (Old Folks on the Hill), but others like Further on Down the Road and Angel are delightful.  Jazz classics like All of Me are done with a light touch.  Still Got the Blues illustrates the style of the album well: it is laid back and lovely to listen to but a far cry from Gary Moore's memorable hard blues version or even Boz Scaggs's treatment of the same tune.
B002VWNID6|5.0|This was the best be cause morgin freeman was a part of the movie<br />and there were thing said and done that were different than the other one<br />Morgiin was cool when he delivered the bay, (I only delivered animals not<br />humans)  that was so coooool !!!!!!!!!
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|Boz continues to produce wonderful work.  His voice is as good as ever and so is his taste.  As on his recent jazz and blues albums, the band is superb.  This album hearkens back to Boz's pre-disco style and is less of a concepot album than his two albums covering classic jazz tunes.  If you like Boz Scaggs, you will love his work on this album.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Well written story about the author, Josh Foer, and his adventures in the world of memory athletics. What is really amazing about this narrative is that these memory “athletes” have no extraordinary abilities. It is just practice, lots of practice, And even more amazing, anyone can become like them. This book sets out to each the average reader how exactly to do this.<br /><br />The book starts with the author’s entertaining journey of his transformation from average Joe to memory superman. The book also teaches his readers with historical information, stories of individuals with memory aberrations, interviews with researchers and a collection of memory athlete characters that make for an entertaining and educational read.

B007W1BLN0|4.0|Good movie.  Showed how he lived his life to the fullest without material possesions.  Sometimes you would think he was on the border of being crazy throughout the movie, extremely fanatical on a lot of things.  If you want more info on his life, you can lookup other facts on the internet.

B007B6VOG0|5.0|Our generation rarely takes the time to appreciate the construction of an album.  We buy our songs in singles through iTunes or Amazon and make playlists full of the facvorites from each artist.<br /><br />Which is ashame, because some Album's are constructed so well - they transcend the material of the individual songs.<br /><br />This album is GREAT.  It flows and carries your emotion from  gentle mourning to elation to just play...well... Fun.<br /><br />I saw Fun a few years ago when I travelled to Pittsburgh to see Foxy Shazam. I'd never heard of them but loved the show.  Now they're huge and I love that I saw them before they were - cool story.  But I'm a definite fan and love their continued evolution.  They're indy rock style manages to be unique even in this tidal wave of new rock.  They remind me a bit of Queen, for the modern era.<br /><br />Buy this album. Listen to it from start to finish.  You'll be happy you did.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|If you're familiar with Daria, any explanation is probably superfluous: either you already own this, or you plan on acquiring it, or else for likely completely valid reasons you have concluded that the series just wasn't for you.<br /><br />For anyone who somehow missed out, however: Daria is in one sense an episodic teen fiction just barely too wacky to have worked as live action, told instead through relatively low-budget cell animation. (It was produced in those very last years when offshored drawing was still cheaper than CGI.) In another sense, however, it's a painfully honest documentary about adolescent life in comfortably-but-still-anxious suburban middle class America in the post Cold War, pre War on Terror 1990s. If you were born between, say, 1975 and 1985, in the United States or potentially just about any prosperous &#34;Western&#34; society, AND spent any significant portion of your youth feeling like the culture surrounding you was some sort of occasionally funny but fundamentally screwed-up joke... Daria is, basically, an only-too-little-exaggerated distillation of your life on the threshold of adulthood, come back now to make you alternately laugh and squirm uncomfortably.<br /><br />If I could only keep 10 works out of all the movies, TV shows, etc., in the world, this would be one of those 10. Without a second thought.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the coolest app ever!!!!!! love!!! love!!! love!!! this!!! this!!! this!!! app!!! app!!! app!!! so much!!! much!!! much!!!  :)
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Very symbolic. Disturbing. It is a movie you must watch over and over again to fully understand. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A NICE BALLET MOVIE, THIS IS NOT IT. This is a story of war within between perfection and perversion. Ballet is only the medium, the context, through which the narrative unfolds.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This is so much better than the tv show gave me more insight on what really happened love it lots
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the best sci-fi books I have read. Well done Mr. Weir.<br />Couldn't put it down. Immensely interesting with great detail in what existing on Mars require.
B0098466CK|5.0|I started listening to The Sword in 2008 when I was looking for new things to check out. At the time I think only Age of Winters was out and Gods of the Earth was about to be released. Being a big Black Sabbath fan I made the inevitable, but not unwelcome comparison between the two. Of the Sabbath knock-off bands I definitely like The Sword the most, they have a great combination of imaginative lyrics, super heavy riffs and moderate speed. Their first two albums make me want to hop on a horse and start lopping off heads Conan-style.<br />Apocryphon picks up where Warp Riders left off in terms of musical development and lyrical content. Age of Winters and Apocryphon are different albums, fans of AoW may not appreciate some of the changes, but fans of Warp Riders will feel right at home. At first I was a little nervous about their increasing use of synths since the first preview track starts off with a long 80's sounding keyboard intro, but after listening a few times I didn't care any more.<br />Pros:<br />Straight up stone hammer heavy<br />Lyrics that really tell intricate stories<br />Nice maturing of their sound<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not as simple as earlier works (doesn't both me)<br />More keyboards (not too bad)<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />This is one of my favorite albums of 2012. Still heavy, still catchy in their own way. Some older fans may not dig the trippy/psychedelic vibe of this one. BUY IT!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|awesome<br />it is a realy fun game and it dosnt take up that much space.get this game it so fun
B002A9VJ40|4.0|This movie has some great lines--ones that are funny and repeatable in certain of life's situation. The acting is okay but you don't watch this movie for the acting. You watch it for the action.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I've always been a fan of SH. They've done a great job bringing him into to the modern world.  Benedict and Martin have a great chemistry as Holmes and Watson.  Can't wait for more seasons.  A definite must watch for any fan.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Another nail biter.  What ever background Michael Connelly writes about, he does his homework first.  Each of his Bosch novels have a different flair.  You would think Connelly knew all about the settings before writing.  Cannot say which novel was my favorite.  His style flows and the suspense builds.  Love, love, all his Bosch Novels.  Pick one and you will want to read more.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Oh my God what a wonderful movie. It is just wonderful!!!!! It takes place alot in India a country i always found beautiful.And Boy is it. That being said it is not a film for everybody . It is a thinking kind of movie.You have to see this film two times to see it all through like it should be. The filming and the color of the movie is AAAAA++++++. You will love it.. I only hope Mr lee does more and more films like this one. Cant you see him doing a Star War film. Or a new Jurassic Park,,, Well I guess you know i love it... I give it five stars ***** And a big A plus....Thanks Amazon for having such a wonderful fime for such a good price.. As always Amazon on the spot ,A+ to you too. THIS SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE. Who will remember Argo next year ? No one.......The Life  of Pi will be like the Wizard of Oz film a classic.....A+
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Saw article in the Wall Street Journal and thought I would check it out.  This is a really good book. Characters draw you in and make you care quickly.  I highly recommend this book even if you aren't a hard core science fiction fan.  I really look forward to future books with more back story and continuation of this story line.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|You feel like you're actually sitting down talking to Chris.  This is raw and real.  Excellent insight into the life of a SEAL and what they go through.
B004W89N72|5.0|Pros: I like the little tags that color-code your entries. I don't have a Google account so I'm not concerned about the sync complaints. You click on a date and you can see the notes for that date. You can switch from month to a weekly view very easily.<br /><br />Con: There were no directions and it took me some time and frustration to figure out how to even enter notes.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great chemistry between the characters<br />Have smartly brought the old stories into the modern world.<br />Cannot wait for season 3
0316069434|5.0|Heard Michael Connelly's THE BLACK BOX (Hachette Audio), read by Michael McConnohie.<br /><br />This is another in the Harry Bosh series of novels, and that's not a bad thing. Unlike many authors who crank out book after book about a particular character, I haven't gotten tired of Bosh--at least not yet.<br /><br />In this one, the detective returns to the LAPD after a brief retirement and becomes involved in a case that's nearly 20 years old when a gun that had been involved in the original murder turns up at the scene of another crime.<br /><br />Bosh never lets up. Neither did I when reading this book. It felt as if I was almost part of Bosh's investigation. I felt for him when his supervisor kept getting on his back. And I was touched by how Connelly depicts the father-daughter relationship that was also a key part to this story.<br /><br />Methinks this book would be a natural for a movie. As a result of listening to it, I got to wondering why the Bosh character has never appeared on screen. There apparently have been some legal wranglings preventing this from happening, but Connelly is now working on a plan to make these books a TV series.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is very well written, engaging and absorbing throughout but the end is so anti climatic. I don't want to give anything away so let's just say I was upset with the ending.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|I have been using this for about a week with my Surface Pro. The problem I have, is that when the computer goes to sleep or is shut down, the device does too. When I wake the machine back up or turn it on, the USB device does not wake up. I have to unplug the device (from a USB 3.0 hub by the same manufacturer) and plug it back in. Then it works fine. So while the unit is powered on, it works well. I updated the device driver and adjusted properties to disable power saving modes, but nothing has helped this situation. One star deduction for the quirk.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I loved everything about this MP3 Album!  As I listened to the music and Sinatra talking to the audience between songs, I felt as if I were right there!  This a wonderful album to listen to while cooking, entertaining, relaxing, anytime you want to get lost in another time era :). I have many Sinatra CDs but this album is unique and special.  I highly recommend it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have several solitaire apps on my kindle fire, but this is by far my favorite.  The cards are just the right size and I like the options for changing the card designs and backgrounds.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I found a lot of the stories fascinating.  It made me look a little closer at what I do and why I do it .  It will also make me look at ad flees a little more closely.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Works well, as it should since it's avast! Comprehensive protection and excellent interface, so far it hasn't found any virus or malware.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Very good but sometimes it goes into so much detail (eg., the sewers) that you wonder if you will ever get back to the story.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I just wish there wasnt a time limit. I understand everything is gonna cost something to unlock it but every little thing these date want money money money
B005H0IW6W|5.0|great album. great singer. timeless songs plus new ones. buble is a hit in my book. he keeps the christmas in the season with this album.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I love Josh Groban's music, however the pieces on All That Echoes all sounded similar, couldn't pick a favorite song that would draw me back to listen.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Laborious...too many new characters and all the best characters killed off prematurely.  Hopefully book six will be a bit more entertaining.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I'm not a sci-fi geek and I thought this was a good show. It's a shame the show was only 14 episodes long and a movie. It would be nice if they did more movies. I wonder which way the show would have gone if it had lasted it's intended 7 seasons. The show has likelable characters and great banter between them. Unfortunately, the characters backgrounds weren't explored too much as the show was cancelled, but still worth the watch.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Again, unrealistic.  Whenever there was a difficult position, a miracle occurred.  I wasn't interested in getting the next books.  What more can I say?
B002WY65W4|5.0|Love this movie. Old but still enjoyable. Hoping for a sequel soon with hopefully the same cast. I just regret that Amber Heard died in the first half hour of the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I had downloaded this app for my daughter but I found it to be addicting lol.  Lots of fun and interesting with great graphics.
B008OTTRXU|2.0|had to return item has of no use could not read in any DVD player I owned even my fiends.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|love Jack Reacher.  love the Kindle app on my ipad. easy to use on my recent trip to San Fran.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw this in the theatre and was enchanted with it . . . I was so surprised to find how much I'd missed when I watched it again. I'm looking forward to many more viewings since I don't know what else I've missed! Besides, with a cast such as this, how could the movie go wrong!
B00BHMF578|3.0|It almost held my attention for the entire time. About as good as the average made for tv movie.<br />Hollywood doesnt make good movies anymore. They try to put morals in their stories but they don't<br />have any so its really hard for them. And of course they have to have the part in the beginning where<br />they leave no doubt that all the blame lies with the people of the united states. Yes the only evil on the entire<br />planet is from mom and pop US.
B009MO5960|3.0|I'm here in the Philippines so I can't avail of the UV digital copy. I hope the studios do something about this.
B004L03B3S|4.0|This is a sexually charged story of two brothers in a close emotional and physical relationship.  It doesn't come across as odd or unusual, but as tender and caring and completely natural.
B00632HWOG|4.0|The thing I like about this is I can get my e.mail anytime I am traveling and I don't have to lug my heavy laptop around.  And I can even reply.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Such a great game! The graphics on it are really crisp and the plot is fun. Easy to move up in the game and earn money. I recommend pony for everyone.
B0098460O4|4.0|Watched them on UTUBE with Britian has talent very good,Charlotte took on Simon and that was neet and loved Jonathan for standing up for her as she is his friend.Would like him to do a solo CD also..
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This was at a great price and easy to find. Shipping was quick and well protected.  Amazing Grace is truly a gereat movie and recommend it to everyone
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Heartfelt and real. The author speaks to all mothers, rich or poor, cross-culturally, and to children as well...especially adoption connections. You will be touched.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game!!! We play it all the time my 4 year old plays and my husband. So much fun
B00571F26Y|5.0|Never knew our wheat was all genetically modified and this modified wheat is now ubiquitous and there were never any studies done to look at long-term effects on human health.  I have cut out 90% of my wheat consumption since I read this book and I feel much better overall and have lost weight even though I was not trying to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|At first was a little confused about this game but now that I understand that you have to complete mission I love this game can't get enough of it.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|This game tricks you into downloading it, gets you hooked then tells you you have to pay for it to continue. So therefore, it is a demo and should be advertised as such. I'm not waisting my money on a game that was advertised as free. The download time was a disgrace, and frankly this game is not worth any of the trouble it causes. Never playing these games again unless they're ACTUALLY free.
B001MYIQK4|5.0|If you love great acting and an amusing script, you can't afford to miss this one.<br />If Jane Austen's humor appeals to you, this wonderful social comedy should tickle you. You laugh at the foolish social conventions of the ladies in this drama while finding that you can't help loving them, too.<br />The ladies of Cranford are played by some of Britain's leading actresses, who are all in top form.<br />My only complaint would be that Eileen Atkins' role wasn't nearly long enough - it's truly memorable- funny and heart-warming.<br />Wonderful cast, wonderful script and wonderful production
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We are half way through season 3 but taking it slow as we don't want it to end.<br />The quality and streaming are great. We love watching our Amazon movies/TV shows now.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|Love it. Bass with a pick. Soaring guitar solos. SYNTH!  Vocals are milquetoast-y but does not take away from the enjoyment.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|awesome pro seems really cool but how do I get out of the thing on inventory write review to help!!!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Constantly changing views. I don't like all the ads guised as pages I &#34;like&#34;. It used to be pretty simple-now I only visit it to see some of my friends, not wade through a lot of nonsense. Maybe I am just too old.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This entertaining masterpiece is based on quite the innovative idea. A must get for anyone that likes Indies games or for the casual gamer.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Glad to have easy access to eBay through this app. I have it on my kindle fire, so it's easy to use.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We fell in love with this series. We are now watching Season 3 but taking it slow as we do not ever want it to end.
B00A1C17EK|5.0|This is a brilliant rendition of Shakespeare and a highly entertaining series. The acting in all four is full of vibrancy and showcases the material in a way that wraps you up so well you forget about everything but the movie. Tom Hiddleston does his best work as Hal/Henry but in my opinion Ben Whishaw was perfectly captivating as Richard II. I could watch that movie a hundred times and never stop loving it.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|Great story line, great actors, funny, and overall cute movie. I love it the same every time i watch it.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This movie was pretty good.  It is sort of confusing at times so you really have to watch every minute or you will get lost.  Wonderful ending!!!
1400032717|1.0|An absolutely awful, brutally boring read. I struggled from p. 50 on so much it felt like work. This would have been a better short story. One of the few books I completely wasted my time on. I'm not sure who would enjoy this.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My daughter loves Monster High and she wanted it. She watched it and LOVED it. She then made me watch it and I found myself liking it too. They are good movies that show true friendship and tolerance. We will buy more Monster High movies in the future.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Having been a great fan of Shirley MacLaine all my life, and have read most of her books, I find this one by her daughter to be a Must Read.  Through the eyes of a child, Sachi, we see the neglect, the lack of love, lack of any parental abilities, from either of Sachi's parents.  She is a strong person to have survived among many uncertainties.  Although she had everything in the way of travel, adventures, etc., she was given very little real love or attention.  She has certainly become a heroine in my view.  I wish her all the best.  I have only pity for Shirley, who missed out on a wonderful opportunity of parenting this lovely young woman.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Ive been watching this movie since the early 90's now I get to share it with my young boys now. I heard laughter in the first five minutes' it was all too cute!
034580404X|5.0|Absolutely love these books, the box set was a great deal and i read them in no time. The writing isn't the best but the story itself is beautiful and I fell in love with a character that doesn't even exist lol. Love Love it!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is a great app for those of us that selling ebay! I love hearing the chaching when I sell something.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I never thought I would like this series but I am hook. Great actors and great story telling. Must see.<br /><br />I'm now on season 4 and I know it going to be hard when I'm done.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is an AWESOME game love Awesome game everybody should rate it 5 stars love the game best ever I play it 24/7
B004X2M9VY|5.0|The Silence (episodes 1-2) is one of the best monsters of Dr. Who and may have the most ingenious ending I've ever seen in any show. The entire season is fairly cohesive with the sum being greater than the parts - which all come into play in the final episodes. The over-arching story line is compelling and the excitement builds as each secret is revealed. I've watched it multiple times and still enjoy it.
B0056BMK6K|3.0|Not what I expected.  There were no real instructions of how to go about it.  Just a lot of verbiage resulting  in that amount of eBooks being sold.  Nothing that I can use.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|This movie was really well captured  the original story from the book and beautifully made;<br />starring, scenes and music were excellent and young actors play was remarkable!<br />It is not just a children's movie but also for many adults who have beautiful memories of their own in childhood and from something special as well
B008764ZQ4|5.0|I watched the movie by myself because my wife thought it would be stupid. During the whole movie, I am singing along and I can hear my wife in the other room belting the tunes out.<br /><br />We are both 80's kids, so the songs are second nature to us, but she watched it with me finally and we both really enjoyed the music and the movie.<br /><br />So I bought the soundtrack and we love it.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|Good show. Good show on friendship. Suspenseful and entertaining . Shows people should be nice to each other.  Enjoyable and entertaining.
B005N09L5C|4.0|Good glimpse into the future for our country.  Once we're disarmed and the media becomes more government controlled than it is now we'll be nothing but tools for the state.  Without the nudity too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app, it is like having a Bible with you without having to carry it around only its even better with all the reading plans.  Love it and use it every morning.
0743270754|5.0|This is the most detailed account of one of the greatest presidents of the U.S. The book is easy to read and follow and it does a spectacular job of using primary sources to bolster the narrative.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars! This is a must see action flick. If your a taker from the past ? I highly recommend this to you!
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I had toughts about where I would stow my bluetooth.  The case was a wonderful idea and to be able to tuck it my shirt pocket is ideal. This is easy access and a comfort place for my investment.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|Sad sad sad. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.<br /><br />I got this after watching &#34;The Fountain&#34; which I found to be beautiful. The darkness in that movie was balanced by brightness. Requiem  was more like watching everyone move into darkness without relief. Each of the characters lives were in the process of spiraling right down the toilet.
B002APU580|5.0|I TRULY LOVE THE ACTING, THE BENNETT'S REALLY SEEMED LIKE FAMILY. MY GIRLS AND I LOVE THIS MOVIE, MY SON ENJOYED AS WELL EVEN THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER ADMIT TO IT. PLUS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE GARBAGE THAT IS IN MOST MOVIES TODAY.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the best game on earth and love love love it sssssssoooooooolol much the game rocks like piazza tum best game ever
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It loaded and weeks later it will not even load it jest will go back to the home page. Sad:.(
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|By the end of season 3 I was tired of everyone with the exception possibly of Thomas and Carson.  Time to wrap it up.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a great old-fashioned (lower tech?) sci-fi  read that kept me going back for more while on vacation last week.  I am so glad I am finding authors like Howey on Kindle.  This is one of those gems that I truly treasure. I had almost given up on finding books like this before I was given a Kindle as a present.<br /><br />Wool Omnibus is an exciting, well thought out story with excellent character development. I particularly appreciate that this author is not afraid of giving powerful roles to females, something that is often missing in science fiction (or in anything other type of fiction for that matter.)  Juliette was a great character and I was rooting for her all the way. The other characters were well developed, too.  I appreciate also that this book can stand alone, despite there being further sequels.  If I were to have any complaints it would be that there were a bit too many details for me.  On the other hand, we have an author here who doesn't go in for too quick pat endings and easy fixes. Over all, it was a very satisfying read and I highly recommend it.
B001GCUNW6|4.0|Always good to see what Manny and the gang is up to.  Our family is a big fan of the Ice Age series and while this isn't one of the best ones it's definitely worth the add to the collection if you like the others.  More importantly, it keeps my sons attention and it comes with the Digital Copy which is nice because I can put it on the iPad and let him watch it there.
B0006HBZXS|4.0|Having given it 4 stars I will start with the negatives. THE EDGE (Widescreen Edition). It is profoundly lacking the &#34;extras&#34; that often come with a dvd, and that I love. you get the&#34;Original Theatrical Trailer&#34;, and the option of Spanish subtitles, French Dolby surround, and thats all. The other drawback will only come to you if you have an understanding of survival training and get offended by the Hollywood version of it. Last, if your an animal lover or have a strong knowledge of bear habits this will seem contrived. Now for the fun stuff.. Excellent pacing with minimal slow spots, lots of scary bear action, and an extra plot twist that works, great camera work with an amazing backdrop (Coniferous forest, lakes and mountains) all had me spell bound. This movie is re-watchable like many of the great action flicks are.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Who doesn't love Peter pan? I think Disney movies are crazy expensive these days which is ridiculous but I want my kids to watch these timeless movies. My 2 1/2 year old boy loves this movie :)
B002NVTBOU|5.0|Buika is truly one of the great voices of all time: the power and depth of<br />emotion she conveys profound. With Chucho Valdez, these two are pure<br />joy (of the highest order).
B000TM1CL0|5.0|Bought for my daughter and she was thrilled.  Item was in great shape, and she loved the show!!  Now I need to find her season 2!!
B000HD1AEA|4.0|I bought this for friend for his birthday and he LOVE IT! Of course he love Sarah Mclachlan as well, it made for a great gift.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|He can look into the heart and soul of the characters and show their good and bad side of each..
B00AF6B22E|2.0|Love Denzel and he's made a ton of great movies.  This one, however, is a dud.  Didn't like the story line or the ending.  Just didn't enjoy the movie at all.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy the graphics and the characters too.  I have always enjoyed seek and find games so this one fit right in.  my grandkids can play with me.
B004WR125O|2.0|The UWF-1 initially worked flawlessly, but then one day - poof - no signal. The device is still talking to the stereo as the MAC address updates with it in or out but its lost all of its wifi mojo. I dont want to buy another one of these to replace it as there is no reason that it wont also stop after 3 months. I dont want to gamble on the other reviewers using the 3rd party devices, so its back to wired connections until Onkyo release a better wifi product.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I should have updated this sooner, but I was so pleased that it worked again, I forgot. The bottom line is that the N755 system requires all of the wifi details to be re-entered, even though it appears to have them all already. It is not in any manual that this is needed, and it seems quite unlikely that it will make any difference, but it worked. I believe the wifi adaptor lost its mind when I used a USB in the front of the N755, but whatever the cause, the adpator still works and im still streaming. So beware, before throwing this little device away, it will be good practice to re-enter all of your network details.<br />by the way, I never heard from Onnkyo customer service despite trying to contact them several times. Dont count on them to help.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I hate running and I hate going to the gym, but I know exercise is important so when a friend recommended this DVD to me, I jumped at it. The workouts are motivating and challenging, and I love that it only takes 20 minutes a day and I can do it in my teeny tiny studio apartment! While there are only three workouts on the DVD, it's a great value for $7 and the format of the workouts keeps it interesting.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What a great book! I don't spend a lot of time reading but this one kept my interest so I kept picking it up for just a few more pages!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is fun and addicting. you can have as many worlds as you want. you can play in &quot;creative&quot; and not have to be attacked by spiders and creepers or play in &quot;survival&quot; and have that challenge. once you create your worlds it isn't hard to move from one to the other. another good thing is when you play in &quot;survival&quot; you can play in &quot;peaceful mode&quot; and not be attacked. I've had no problems with this game re. glitches or software issues. this is a great game!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It&acute;s so fun. My friends love it, I love it, and my sister loves it. It awesome! You have to get it.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|It still heats up really fast so I can't leave it plugged into the wall too long to charge the kindle fire.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I cant say how much I like this game! Its every dream of spider-man lovers! buy this game If you love or even like spider-man!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This movie just rambles on and on and after awhile, I found myself wishing it were over. With such great actors in the cast, I guess I expected a LOT more. Please don't waste your money on this one. In fact, I wouldn't even rent it for free.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Jodi Picoult at her best! This story about a school shooting is intense and keeps you guessing unitl the very end. Great book!
B0040HO16S|5.0|I was looking for a great period drama to pass the time before season 4 of Downton Abbey started. This series is fantastic!  I watched all 4 seasons (with the exception of episode 1 of season 2), I loved every episode.  Another fine production from the BBC!  This is my first review so that tells you how much I liked this series. ENJOY!
B005P4PAVK|4.0|Even in its fifth season, The Big Bang Theory continues to deliver laughs. I'm sure at some point it will have to end, but we're not there yet,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because it's a great game for all ages!My 5 yr old sister plays it all the time!!!
B0033RT7RE|4.0|I really like this movie.  I think it's interesting.  My husband, however, did not care for it as much as I did.  he was bored.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Starts out good but I kept expecting something to happen.  I kept reading and reading and finally had to ask a friend if something indeed was going to happen.  After being told no, I put the book down and never finished it.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I enjoyed this easy read but it wasn't great. I am a fan of Ellen but found this book a bit dull. Some funny aspects for sure so it's an okay read if you're looking for something quick and easy.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I enjoy all of the characters so much.  I've watched the series twice and will watch many more times.  I've recommended it to all of my friends.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I love the characters. The story and twisting plot never disappoint. I hate to put it down!! Everyone I've recommended it to are loving it as well. It reminds me of a 1775 Scottish Christian Grey novel. :)
B0000CABJ1|4.0|The music on this CD is truly the BEST of Donna Summer's.  Takes me back to my teen years!  I know I can always find what I'm looking for at Amazon.Com
B008M87GJK|4.0|I am interested in a different take of the current world news. The election of a new pope who is not from Europe motivated my choice of BBC.
B009738XXM|4.0|I bought this on one of Amazon's super sales, so it was cheap.  It's cute, pop music, good for working out.  I'm not much of a music expert so I can't really describe it or compare it to much.  I just know it's got a good beat for running or biking.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from Tina Fey's book but I really enjoyed it. If you find Fey's humer and TV show, 30 Rock, funny then you will enjoy this book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Simple but fun when bored without real horses. Free and easy! Only thing annoying is gems for getting new stuff.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I watched this as a movie recently and did not expect to like it because I do not usually like books in the teen/young adult genre.  I was pleasantly surprised by the movie; I actually like it a lot.  I decide to give the book a try as well, and found it to be quite entertaining!  The character development is good, and the book is an exciting quick read.  I am impressed!<br /><br />I like the book well enough that I will read the sequels as well.  Well done book, and I highly recommend it to fans of both fantasy and science fiction.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I was horse crazy as a kid so I was excited about this app and I can't say I am disappointed--especially for a free app! The animation is gorgeous, and the \\"gameplay\\" is easy to figure out. My kids love it too-- they beg to play with my horse Hazelnuss, and now that we have leveled up enough to do quests--it is even more fun.Only a few complaints:  it crashes on occasion, the games are a little simplistic, and most items (and locations) are way too expensive! There's no way I will spend real money on gems,  so it will be a looong time before I can get another horse or a better paddock. Still,  it's by far the nicest virtual pet app I have seen. You won't regret it!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|One of the best shows I've seen, combined with one of the best artists of our times. Need I say more?
B008YZXYY2|5.0|This is the best stone sour album so far. it is full of great songs. the traveler songs are great.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The fun thing about it is that u get to be in Rome.And the good part about it is that it is free
B000001FTN|4.0|I thought I was going to like the music better than I do.The only track I love is Moments in Love.The others are just okay for me,however ; it was worth buying the CD just for that one music arrangement.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved this book so much! I would read it again in a heartbeat! It made me sad and happy at the same time time. Loved it!!
B00B7FWWNA|1.0|I watched this movie with my 21 year old sister - so I was very comfortable (I'm 25) - AND I STILL WANTED TO CRAWL OUT OF MY SKIN! Apparently paraplegics being taught raunchy sex tips is too much for me to handle. If you're into soft core porn though, this is the one for you. (Go Helen Hunt for being so confident)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I got this about a month ago, and have sharpened some of my old kitchen knives with it. I took a pretty dull, larger sized knife that I've dreaded using for a long time, and I gave it about 10-20 swipes on each of the sharpening slits, and then I put the knife to the test. First I tried it on paper, and it worked pretty good, but seemed like it needed more. I gave it another 10-20 swipes on each again and then I put it to the real test. The tomato sliced like butter! I could make the thinnest slices! Havent tried the serrated tool yet, but I'm already impressed. Would definitely recommend.
B008G12ERC|5.0|I have never heard of this group. I bought an album and really enjoy it. I love the words to all of the songs. my favorite pieces are tracks 2,4,6,8, and 12.<br />I bought the album because I had heard track #2
B000F1IQNM|5.0|quick delivery and in new condition when it arrived.  I purchased this for myself and absolutely love this movie.  It is a great watch.  Thanks so much
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It's not a bad book, neither is it exceptional. The story tended to drag in some places but it's an okay read.
B006C3Q6GG|3.0|A tough read.  Very dry at times. I love the genre.  I enjoyed S. Thomas Russel's series much more.  Try Under Enemy Colors.
1466401885|1.0|At least the author got the title right. I have been debating about getting this book for the past couple of months - my gut was telling me based on the reviews that it wasn't going to be what I wanted, but it had enough 5 star reviews I thought it was worth checking out. (SPOILERS BELOW)<br /><br />Turns out, I should have listened to my gut. What we have here is a story about an extremely abusive relationship, that really has no redeeming qualities for it. Travis is manipulative, dependent, a stalker, whiny, insecure and most of all pathetic...and I could use almost the same list to describe Abby. The relationship that develops is extremely disfunctional and volatile, not something that would be encouraged by friends/family. Travis has a horrible temper - and if I had a dollar for every person he punched, threatened to punch, intimidated or treated horribly I would almost be able to buy myself a plane ticket to Vegas. And the fact that everyone just accepts it from him is even worse - there are never any consequences for his behavior - the police are never called despite his numerous assaults, Abby continues to stick around and he is never encouraged to get help for his behavior.<br /><br />And the ending...REALLY??? I've dated you on/off for the past year (more off than on), we spend more time arguing than anything else, but I love you more than anything and we are only disfunctional when we are apart...together we make sense. So at 19 years old, let's get married!!! Because that will make everything better and all of our issues will go away!!! Great message to send to the readers.<br /><br />The only thing that I am thankful for is that I have at leasted saved myself the $7 and most importantly my time as there will be absolutely no reason to read the sequel.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|If you like 3match games you will really enjoy this one. I loved making the village. The graphics were beautiful and worked great on my kindle fire.  I am looking forward to the next one!!!!
B0083DJUMA|5.0|For anybody wanting more detailed information on what's going on in the Maker community.  Also, a good place to start if interested in becoming a Maker.  Well written and fun to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm an avid reader and rarely find a book so compelling that I actively search for time throughout the day to continue reading it. A great story, well told, and characters you feel like you know after reading it. Highly recommend this one!!!
B0094K1MH2|3.0|The adventures of Tintin is a fairly sophisicated movie.  I guess you can't assume that something is for children since it's animated!  There was a fairly complicated storyline, evil characters, and lots of violence.  My husband and I enjoyed it a lot more than our young son.  Unfortunately, we didn't get some peaceful time alone that evening!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Usually Connelly falls off at the end. Not so here. The suspense builds to the end. All story lines tied together
B000NWJI6C|5.0|BEST PROGRAMMABLE CALCULATOR. HOPE MORE IMPROVEMENTS IN NEXT VERSION LIKE CONNECTING TO COMPUTER VIA USB AND BE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRAMS FROM PC AND EXPORT THEM TO THE CALCULATOR<br />FADI_BOUSTANY_DSCI@HOTMAIL.COM
B007THA4FI|2.0|Knowing some of The Rowling personal history, it's not surprising about her choice of locale, characters and plot.  It was not easy to get into.  None of the characters could be termed redeeming.  One felt that the lovely village of Pagford really had an omnipresent black cloud hanging over it.  Not a light read or entertaining one either.
B000V698DS|5.0|Great album! I have owned it on cassette for years and finally upgraded to CD and MP3 formats.  I like the live bonus tracks too.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham does not disappoint the  reader.  As hoped for the story keeps the reader in suspense and entertained.  Hard to put down.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|My husband and I also enjoy this show and Amazon was the only place we could find it for a decent price. It was a great add to our collection. We watched the whole thing in 3 days!
0425263908|1.0|This was a rip off of Fifty Shades of Grey. It was almost the same, two people in need of some help. A young guy f* up beyond all hope and it just didn't do it for me. The characters were the same except for in diffrent surrounding. Fifty Shades of Grey was raw, powerful and intense it sucked me in and I couldn't put the book down. This one just didn't do it for me.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This rollercoaster plays with the quality you expect from a dedicated game playing machine by Nintendo, Sony, MS, and the like.  As everyone says, &quot;It's great fun &hellip;, I can't stop playing &hellip;.&quot;  The game not only has comic characters and look which YOU can vary endlessly, it appears to follow the rules of motion of conventional (Newtonian) physics.  I culd go on praising the game, but I'm going to stop here and get back to playing this game.<br /><br /> Enjoy, Dick R.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|It was a great start but I felt that by the end of the triology they had gone down hill alot.
1476735115|1.0|This book had received 3855 reviews at the time I am writing this. That is a colossal number. Having sampled some of them, it seems rather obvious that the author, who published through Amazon's Kindle self publishing, has received strong support from Amazon in the rating of this book. Such tactics are a disservice to Amazon's customers and are certain to affect the perceived partiality of the review feature of products offered on the website.<br /><br />Since I posted this review, I have received four attacks including one from the author. None of them bore any relevance whatsoever to my statement above.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  Finished it in 3 days.  Can't wait for books 6 & 7 to be published!
B00866JL96|5.0|I have read The Lucky One by Nicholas Sparks and although the movie doesn't follow the book perfectly it was still entertaining and I was excited to find it on Amazon for such a great deal.
0061673730|5.0|This is a book that I picked up at a bookstore on a whim without being aware of it's accolades and praise. Robert Pirsig writes brilliantly and in a manner easy to understand. This is the one book that I will recommend to anyone thats wanting a good read. There are so many topics that he delves into, such as the nature of the subject-object duality, Romantic and Classical nature, and most importantly his thesis of quality.<br /><br />I think this book will really strike a chord with anyone who considers themselves a casual philosopher, and enjoys thinking in new, different ways. The thoughts that the book expresses will really stick with you when thinking about really anything in general. It's not necessarily the most exciting book as its spent mostly expounding on philosophical concepts and wrapped up in a motorcycle journey half-way across the country, but the journey serves it's purpose as a way to introduce these concepts in a real and compelling way.<br /><br />My reading of the book consisted of reading a chapter or two and stopping to really chew on the new information and personally I think it to be a better read that way. Really consider what Robert Pirsig has to say and you won't find the book anything less than excellent.<br /><br />Buy the book, read it, and think different.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Not a favorite, but very cute and heart warming. Young and true romance. Bits of comedy. Great cinematography!! Real cool 60's feel.
B00442OI1C|5.0|Chuck is one of by favorite shows of all time. And the episode chuck vs phase three is my favorite of the series. The episode shows Sarah's vulnerability and how much she needs chuck. Love it.
B008220D5K|1.0|Well, I have to admit, that I didn't like the main female character from the start, an almost anorexia-attacked, neurotic mother, who insists that she's 38, although she'll celebrate her 40th birthday in the next days (and actually looks like 46), constantly playing with her hands, like all bad american actresses do. Yeah, todays women over 35 need to have well visible rib bones and fatless upper arms in order to feel better and clothes are a fundamental thing, it's so much more important than being a brilliant actress. Sorry, where have all those glamorous stars with real talent and genuine beauty gone? I'm sick and tired of seeing this type of woman here more and more and everywhere, including my daily life. Furthermore I got annoyed over those senseless dialogues with a more or less nice husband and constantly appearing useless innerfamiliar conflicts. Life isn't a princess fairytale for none of us, but why making such a neurotic movie with no surprises out of it?<br />There are so many great family-stuff-movies out there, go and get another one.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|Diana is the reigning &#34;crooning diva,&#34; and she is an inventive and accomplished pianist. She's always on the mark with her song selection, and her phrasing is as good as it gets. The lady is smooth as silk!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|High quality, shipped quickly,  and a great price. I felt that I received a great value for my money. Awesome product!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|fringe has everything i look for in a tv show.  mystery, thrills, romance, comedy and drama. all wrapped around a beautiful sci-fi setting.  the writers pull you in with stories that would have most people hooked. every episode was like a candy trail, leaving me asking &#34;where is this delicious treat bringing me?&#34;.  it leads to a lovely addiction to the series my friends.  i compare fringe to some of my other favorite shows: X-files, Twilight Zone, Twin Peaks, and Heroes.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the story lines, the costumes, the characters. And the awe inspiring countryside. I only wish there were more episodes in a season, its over much to quick.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|This was the most Juvenile movie, possibly, ever. _ Not surprising, as it was co-written & directed by rapper, RZA... And not surprising, the plot has about as much depth as most rap songs. _ Seriously, a Five-Year-Old could come up with a better frickin' story; and at least then we wouldn't have to suffer the narcissistic rapper as a main character... because his \\"acting\\" is as poor as his writing, directing, etc.<br /><br />This is non-stop ridiculousness, on top of ridiculousness... in the form of a movie-length, bloody, kill-fest, music-video (again, not surprising). _ I knew what I was in for from the start... I knew he was going for a \\"old chinese cinema\\" style, outlandish, kung-fu film... But this was just GOD AWFUL from start to finish. _ Even if he'd cast an actual Actor to play his role, it STILL wouldn't even be worthy of 2 stars.<br /><br />Seriously, I think he just wanted an excuse to get near a bunch of hot Asian girls, with the hopes of \\"hooking up\\" with a few.<br /><br />Russell Crowe, what the Hell were you thinking!??... Well, it sure wasn't about your Filmography/Legacy, that's for sure. _ Maybe he's so depressed about where his 'career' is, that that's why he got so fat? (he's HUGE in this movie! like, 75 lbs overweight, at least)
B009WO7NQO|1.0|It just goes right ahead and shuts on down everytime I try to watch the video after level four.. oh joy
B003ES61EE|3.0|It's a nice accessory but I haven't had any real need to use it. I guess it's best for those who take their cameras to the beach for the sand.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Another great value with high quality sound for a low price. It shipped quickly and my sister was thrilled on Christmas morning.
B008MM9630|5.0|Cute  game. Fun and easy gAme. Love that you don't have to be connected to the internet. I take my Kindle every place and don't always have internet access.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very addictive game and lots of levels to enjoy!! Once you start playing, you are not going to want to stop
B00005NTN5|5.0|Excellent script, directing and story. Jennifer Tilly is amazingly sensuous and alluring in this film and, as w/ all the cast, delivered a great performance. This is a fun film to watch. Not for the squeamish, though. Gets a bit violent in parts.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Ive been hooked on the Jack Ryan series since picking up the Hunt For Red October. Can't get enough and now I'm following jr. What am I going to read until the next title is released.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Strong r-rated humor, something to offend everyone. Very funny dialog, you have to listen closely to get it.  Simple but cute story
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I rented the Hunger Games first because I wanted to make sure I loved it as much as the books. When I ordered the 2 disc dvd, I was impressed with all the extra features!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Wonderful graphics and engaging gameplay that, depending on what mindset you start with, can be quite slow and relaxing or very quick and intense. I have a droid 3 &amp; a transformer prime,  osmos runs great on both.
0071752854|5.0|Outstanding Book.  First, I'd like to thank Oren for changing my life, even as I type this review.  The lessons brought forth by Oren in Pitch Anything not only apply to the business sector; I'm applying these lessons to my life as well.  For years I have been what one would call a people pleaser.  I could never understand why, no matter how nice I was, I always finished last.  Finally after reading just the first chapter of Oren's book, I realized that being pleaser wasn't serving me any true purpose at all; it revealed a fear an neediness in me I never recognized before, until now.  Though change has been a painful process, I've paralleled using the guidance from Pitch Anything both at my job and in the rest of the functions in my life. I can't say enough about what a great read Pitch Anything is. All I can say is, see for yourself, and enjoy the new you on the way.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch is still a hard core bad ass. Great story. I liked the Gould character in this one. The senator's involvement is suspect.
6300268683|2.0|SPOLILERS:<br />A drug carrier (Lisa) smuggles a doll loaded with drugs into the U.S. As she departs the airplane, Lisa recognizes bad guy Roat(Alan Arkin) and quickly gives the drug doll to another passenger, (Sam Hendrix) to protect the contents.<br /><br />Roat takes off with Lisa while Sam takes the doll home.<br /><br />Later, we find Lisa dead in Sam's apartment.  Roat has killed her and somehow tracked down where Sam lives.<br /><br />Apparently Roat had time to take Lisa to the apartment, kill her, and put her in the closet with no one noticing.<br /><br />Roat also enlists two thugs to meet with him in Sam/Susy's apartment while neither of them are home.<br /><br />Sam's wife Susy (Audrey Hepburn) who is blind eventually comes home.  She likes to leave her door unlocked and tell every stranger who comes through the door everything and anything about Sam and herself.<br /><br />Instead of threatening or torturing Susy to find out where the doll is, Roat decides to have his two thugs attempt to trick Susy into disclosing the whereabouts of the drug doll by posing as a family friend and police officer.<br /><br />Although she knows nothing about the doll's contents, Hepburn<br />uses her extra sensory skills to outwit the baddies throughout the film.<br /><br />The plot was utterly ridiculous which in turn destroys the movie.  Apparently this film was originally a play.  The entire film takes place in Susy's apartment.<br /><br />Hepburn's character was valiant and brave as a blind woman but this does not save the film.<br /><br />Could not recommend.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|the free app kept freezing... worth paying $1.99... I have so much fun playing with friends... I love yatzee tons
B00BMUYLSE|3.0|Only listened  a couple times to the whole album.  Only 2 or 3 outstanding songs. They sound very similar, with the same intruments being used. Wish I could say there was a &#34;Sorrow&#34; or &#34;Starman&#34; on, that will stay with us forever. Give it a try, in any case....Bowie usually grows on you.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|This is not the first time I have downloaded a movie and been very disappointed in the quality. Its pixilated. I have a great computer and TV monitor set up, most of what I view is great. This is one that just isn't worth the cost.<br />By the way, my graphics card and TV handle HD (and whatever that secret coding is) and the fact that Amazon chooses to not allow me to download HD because I use a PC is just rubbish. I go to iTunes and don't seem to have a problem there.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|This multi-tool is the best I have ever used. It is well made from very good steel. All the tools are on the outside and look in place! All the tools are very good quality and functional, and easy to open. They lock positively with no play. You can really put a lot of torque into the tools and they do not bend. This is another great Gerber product!
B00846WWVM|4.0|You're a firefighter on a moon of Saturn, and some tourists accidentally knocked a slew of meteorites into your planet, setting all kinds of things ablaze!  Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to put out the fires with as little water waste as possible while avoiding obstacles and using objects to your advantage.  By the way, don't let the guys, or anything else, catch fire, because that fire spreads fast!<br /><br />The music is okay, but a tad annoying, and so are the sound effects.  This isn't such a big deal, because you can disable them easily.<br /><br />The graphics are nice, and the environment is delightful for all ages.  I have no doubt that this will keep my two children occupied for extended periods.<br /><br />Yes, this physics-based game has excellent water simulation and controls, as well as behave itself when you want to leave it, which probably won't be for a while.<br /><br />Like many other games of this genre, you unlock additional chapters through collecting drops (stars) top unlock the next set of levels.<br /><br />Where this game falls flat, however, is in the nearly absent instructions our tutorial levels, and the extreme difficulty in obtaining five drops (stars), or even finishing a level decently, right from the start of the game.  In other words, the &quot;ramp up&quot; to being challenging is far too steep.  These two reasons are why I docked a start off the rating.  Ramp slower, drop a screen or two of instruction and a couple of tutorial levels, and this game would be a five star game.<br /><br />Still, it is a cute, enjoyable game that is definitely worth the price as is. :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One heck of a book, what a great way to end the trilogy, it couldn't have been better than it just was:)
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Not my cup of tea.  Plot was unclear, and it took too long to pick up and get my attention.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Harry Potter lovers will be disappointed.  Not her usual imagination and I missed that.  Story matter was rather depressing, many disfunctional families
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could not put this down!  I laughed, cried, and felt every emotion possible while reading.  I highly recommend this book to any reader.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky and Holder = Best. Couple. Ever.<br /><br />So this book starts of with Sky, a headstrong, doesn't care what anybody says about her kind of girl,making out with this guy. Later as the story continues, she meets Holder. No guy has ever made her feel ANYTHING at all. Except Holder. As the story continues, you start to realize that this book isn't just about love. No it is much more ,but Holder and Sky's love story added into it just makes it 10x better. This story is about both of these love-sick teens finding themselves with the help of each other. Hopeless will make you smile, laugh out loud, make your jaw drop, and it will make you cry. I was crying and turing the page and i just kept crying. This is a must read. If you don't read this you are an idiot. I was iffy but now i know that this book is just perfection. Oh and you WILL fall in love with Dean Holder. It is inevitable.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I downloaded this for my 9 year old grandson, and he loves it. I haven't tried it, but he gives it five stars.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I really liked most of this book but the ending left a lot to be desired.  Did he really do the murder or not?  As a book club we read this book and there was much disagreement about the ending and whether the boy was for sure guilty.  Also, don't want to spoil this for anyone so stop reading if you want to read the book -- but to have the mom do what she did at the end was really a hard thing to swallow as both a mom and a reader.
B002WN35DC|5.0|este tipo de clasico, traspasa generaciones...es tan lindo, nos inspira y nos recuerda de no olvidar el ni&ntilde;o que llevamos dentro, la inocencia, creatividad y sinceridad de esos a&ntilde;os..
0385535147|5.0|Grisham's lawyer protagonist is a surprise anti-hero in a complicated plot full of surprises.  A great read, although the reader might lose sleep until the last page is finished.  Grisham writes great books!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|If you are a Grisham addict, this is classic good stuff.  Mr. Grisham is one of the best story tellers around and this one does not disappoint.  The characters are intriguing and the action is very interesting.  I liked this one very much.  I look forward to his next one.
B004P7CN7W|5.0|It is a very good movie if you like old si-fi/horror movies, and remember Frodo is the star of the movie.
B009C7JS14|2.0|Provides excellent weather reporting but only displays one way.  You need to rotate your Kindle which causes the Kindle to be upside down based on how most covers fit a Kindle Fire.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I could not put this book down while I was reading it, but the ending was a huge disappointment.  I'm not even sure what the ending means.  I read this book as part of a book club and no one liked the ending and we all got a different take on what the author was trying to say happened to the characters with the ending. It seemed like there was so much detail to the book, but the author had just had enough of writing and decided to end the book.  Very much a bummer.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed the first book, it was not easy to put it down and it gives you an introduction of the life's of Christian and Ana and introducing more characters like the Grey Family..<br />Is exciting, enticing, exuberant,  and just takes you away from reality....for a while...which sometimes is good...
0345803485|3.0|So an innocent girl becomes involved with a weird billionaire.  She is so sweet (translate: dumb) that she is easily ensnared and adapted to his ideas.  Not a very well written story and it seems odd that E.L. James would offer a class in novel writing. . .  As a longtime reader of all sorts of things, I compare this to The Story of O and that book is better.
1421532255|5.0|This book is so worth getting if you are a fan of the death note series and of course an L fan. It gives you an alternate ending on how things could have played out revolving around L's death. It gets into a deeper aspect of whatL goes through and shows you how he saves the world in his last days of life.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I love this CD. It sounds wonderful while playing in my car. I feel like I am sitting in the audience as I listen to it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I liked the characters and the language of flowers is an interesting lost art. This book kept my interest until the last page.
030758836X|5.0|I kept hearing how great this book was, so I knew I had to get my hands on it.  I'm glad I did!  The plot was like a windy road - it kept taking different turns and I really didn't know where it would end up.  I enjoyed the suspense and I would definitely recommend this book to others, especially if you typically like crime or suspense novels.  Hope to read more of her works in the future!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Kills time really well. Though I am having bit of trouble with the card and background customization. Still pretty cool.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|the graphic and the setting are very good. Love the animation that is presented in the game. Keep up the good work and come out with some new items for this game.
0446547573|4.0|Safe Haven is an amazing book with a struggle and romance.  It shows how a woman in an abusive relationship can change her situation and still find love even with her horrible past.
B0088ETCHW|5.0|Super good book... Experience based swimming tips and trainning drills and plans. With first read I was able to inmediately increase speed and endurance over 20%.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I could not put this book down, I was even reading during work.... i was totally shocked by the ending
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun game that keeps me occupied when I am bored. I love how you can get different people.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app ever. Awesomer than any other app and will be worth your money. Get it now!!!<br /><br />Warning: May be too awesome for you.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love the graphics on this game. Love to play this game showing how to raise a dragon from beginning to end.
1609611543|5.0|Everyone should read this. I knew about his already but not to this extreme..Did you know wheat goes beyond the blood brain barrier...Man you can hardly touch brain cancer with chemo...but guess whats in your brain, wheat. Guess what it does to your brain. You should read this if you care, if you dare!
B00A17AD36|4.0|Definitely worth it. Of the 30 songs, I can't think of one I absolutely hated. Some of the songs did sound alike, but I liked it nonetheless. It got me through a boring 3 hour drive in the middle of nowhere.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|Some of the same actors as in Downton Abbey.  Great family fare.  We were so sorry to see the early end, but apparently some of the major characters had schedule conflicts.
B0038TWHP6|4.0|I found this to be fairly entertaining. It brought in interesting character development with historical accounting for Collin's political life and personal tragedies.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this AP.  I love doing Sudoku and this ap is great for that.  I love the different levels that there are and I love that is moves to the next level after you are done with one.  I love that it keeps your spot if you have to stop.  I love that if you are done with one and have to stop that it show you the list of where you are and you can start right back up at that point.  Just cannot say it enough I LOVE THIS AP!!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|the graphic and the setting are very good. Love the animation that is presented in the game. Keep up the good work and come out with some new items for this game.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|absolutely B for boring. from start to finish.!!!!  the dialogue was hard to understand with her strong accent and the<br />mumbling of the other characterJude Law was casted as an idiot husband with absoluetly no clue of marriage and she was<br />clueless
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I am a sci-fi fan and this movie rates right up there with Star Wars.  Wonderful special effects especially in 3D.  What a movie should be and that is totally entertaining.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I shall forever be a fan of Conan Doyle's Baker Street Maverick Sherlock Holmes and his companion, the venerable Dr. John Watson. Yes, there are inconsistencies in some of the narrative and it s certainly evident that Conan Doyle's editors let those inconsistencies slip by. I suppose it is not an easy feat to write to deadline when you are attempting to entertain guests simultaneously as Doyle and his wife often did.  But those very inconsistencies will always be the unique coloration to the stories that might easily take on the sepia tones of the Victorian Day. This Kindle book is well laid out and a joy to read in between the more heady volumes gracing my Kindle bookshelf.  A definite must for your Kindle Library.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Eagles are beautiful birds and I'm glad we are getting a blu-ray documentary about them. They have been the bird representing America for over a million years and it took just as long to finally give them the respect and honor they deserve. Sure, some of them are bald, but so are most dads and there are plenty of documentaries about dads. Dads can't fly either, but eagles can. Unless you count flying in an airplane or flying when they jump out of an airplane or helicopter, but that's not even on the same level as the flying that eagles can do.<br /><br />I am looking forward to this documentary very much and even pre-ordered the expensive version.
1401216676|5.0|This by far the best Joker comic by far if you have this its a great add to your collection Plus the prices is awesome on Amazon Must Have
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|When this movie came out some years back, I regretfully neglected to see it on the big screen.  When I did see it on VHS, I was immediately hooked!  I recently watched it on my kindle while cleaning out the garage.  This is such a great classic; whether you watch it on the big screen, VHS, DVD, or the kindle- it will always be a favorite of mine.
B001AH6ZWY|1.0|The DVD would NOT load on my BLU-Ray player. I have sent it back to Amazon for exchange. Sending back a DVD entails a lot of extra work which I did not appreciate. I am waiting for my replacement DVD.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like the variety of the new birds from the movie Rio. It's pretty cute. I like the variety of the locations too.
B00985E3UG|5.0|I saw M. Moss as a guest speaker on Dr. Oz.  SSf is an easy read and very enlightening about the ways the processed food industry makes their products so appealing we can hardly resist them.  Government agencies that exist to protect us are influenced by political sway, so consumers beware.  Thank you, Mr. Moss.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Bon Jovi is the best band ever! This album is great and I hope the radio plays more of it.
1616550414|4.0|My sons really liked it. They were expecting it for a long time and always asked me to by it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This was a very enjoyable book that I could not put down. The characters were interwoven into the international story taking place in the years leading up to WW1 and after. As soon as I finished this, I grabbed my library's copy of the 2nd part of the trilogy, Winter of the World. Can't wait for the third book! Follet is easy to read without dumbing down his material.
B008MEM24S|5.0|He says it makes more sense and seems to have a lot more fun playing it<br />He thinks wher's my water is too hard.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I didn't realize that I would have to pay to STOP the ads from stopping the game every round. It's getting annoying.
B0062OCNAI|3.0|A mystery a tragedy a complicated story line.  A great deal of love. Shows so many human emotions. An ending that was expected but makes you feel that when you leave this earth you leave a lot behind of yourself.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the most awesome site. So many good hints and tips. I love it. I have recommended it to several people.<br />If you don't join Pinterest, you don't know what your missing !
B00APUQT7I|5.0|What a funny version of the continental shifts and a little family values sprinkled in for good measure! I giggled through the whole movie!
B008I43DYU|5.0|I love that the numbers are large enough to press and read easily! It works like a charm. Can't believe I waited this long to download it.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I was waiting for another Bon Jovi CD to come out.  I Love his music.  He writes from the heart and is a great person that cares about people. Thanks for sharing with your fans.
B0098460O4|5.0|These sweet teens are so blessed beyond their imagination. To have such angelic & powerful voices is truly a gift beyond measure. Jonathan kudos to you for sticking by Charlotte as only true kindred souls would.
B00064VR0W|4.0|He hasn't lost any talent in all these years!<br /><br />I recommend it to old and new fans alike - a fine performance.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always liked playing Solitaire. Always played with a deck of cards.  But like the convenience of the computer.<br />Fun game !
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Very exciting and I liked, Tom Cruise , Jereme  Reener  and all the players in this exciting action packed movie.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|The story of recognizing and appreciating all our senses regardless of physical or mental challenges. Helen Hunt and John Hawke' rendition was tender and sensitive.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|This movie is fantastic, and by far the best action movie I've seen in a VERY long time.  Now I've read a good amount of the negative reviews on this movie, because I was absolutely dumbfounded that there were so many as to bring the overall rating to a 3.5 stars, when every other movie critic website shows that the reaction to this movie has been overwhelmingly positive (and deservedly so).  The recurring theme from one review to the next is that it's boring, but to me, the use of the word \\"boring\\" seems to have been confused with \\"doesn't feature 90 straight minutes of mind-numbing gunfire, explosions and special effects\\".  THAT would be a far more accurate description, because this movie is anything but boring.  The quiet moments we're offered with The Driver and the people close to him serve to develop the characters, which is done very effectively.  A very clear image is painted of the kind of person The Driver is (quiet and humble, if a bit awkward) in the world outside his life of crime, and the time he spends with his neighbor and her son shows us why he should care so much about keeping them safe, and by extension, why WE should care that he does.  The quiet scenes also do a very good job of making the exciting scenes pop all the more by emphasizing that if a person like The Driver were to exist in reality, not every waking moment of his life would be showdowns with mobsters or ducking behind mattresses to avoid gunfire.<br />Another complaint I've noticed is that the violence in this movie is just too much.  This complaint comes from the same society that throws money at torture porn movies like the Saw or Hostel series.  While some of the stuff in this movie IS very gruesome (with criminals chasing and murdering each other, there's gonna be some ugliness), it's both appropriate to the context of the movie and, in my opinion, not overdone.  We see glimpses of horror, such as the woman being blown away in the bathroom and Bryan Cranston getting sliced open,but only enough to make the audience face the gravity of what's happening in the scene.  There are no prolonged shots held on bleeding corpses or destroyed skulls.<br />This movie has solid characters played very well by their actors, a simple and engaging story, and a soundtrack that could not possibly be more fitting.  Ignore the whiners, turn this movie on and enjoy every moment both loud and quiet.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A very dark, depressing book, but well written with several twists and surprises.  I would recommend this novel to a friend.
B007712XAU|5.0|My husband and I love the series of 'Downton Abbey'.  We bought the DVD set so we can watch it over and over:-)<br />Amazon had the best price for the DVD's<br />Thanks Amazon!!!
0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is a great writer and an even better story teller, he showcases the geniuses and successful people of the world and just how they got to be where they are today. AMAZING!
0061743526|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is probably my favorite book ever. I was forced to read it for school but once I picked it up, I could not put it back down. This book realy showed me how great reading can be. Harper Lee writes in such a way that keeps your eyes locked in on the page. The multiple storylines keeps you enticed and you cant help but feel complete pity for Tom Robinson. And I have no never found a character I liked more than Atticus Finch. It also is one greatest movies. Gregory Peck at his finest. This book really had an effect on me and inspired me to read other books.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this book. So much so, I have given other copies to friends, but had to keep one for myself. A bit selfish you could say, but it's a great book that I look forward to reading again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Went fast! Easy read! Enjoyed the book! Not typical Grisham but loved it! Great beach or poolside book for summer
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is my absolute favorite Android game. It is simple yet  also entertaining and challenging.  I  am eagerly looking forward to Part 2!
0061733199|5.0|You may never ever need some of the knowledge from this book, but if you use even one piece of the information it is going to be more than worth the cost. I have found this to be a very interesting read that has some fantastic information and pretty decent pictures though I wish there were more pictures to go with the explanations the details provided are good and easy to understand without them. I got this as a useful information guide for my  husband who goes hiking but I found myself reading through it as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like a challenge this is the game for you. Every time you reach your goal, you have a higher goal. SO FREAKIN ADICTING!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book should be a movie. Its a good story with lots of NASA tech. May be boring for the more simply minded.
B008XG1X18|5.0|nice you can pull up recipes and set on counter not have to print them off. great thing to have!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is fun,addictive game I get very competitive to win character also hover boards,and much more.right now I'm trying to beat my high score!!!
B005T87QCI|5.0|I love this game and I have the movie wich makes the game a whole lot better because you know most of the robots.The game has some other robots that are not in the movie.You can design your own robot too.Remember this game is AWSOME!!!!!!
B00170MYIS|5.0|Simply SONY . Talks about the brand is talk about quality products, durability, performance etc. I always can see how the products of the same brand work better.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I orginally went to see this movie with my nephew in the theaters.  Both of us really enjoyed it.  Once I saw it was being released, I ordered immediately to add to the collection of kids films that I keep in case kids are over.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|The knife sharpener works just fine but the extra part for serrations is amazing.  I had a few knives that needed sharpening on the serrations and after using this they are nearly razor sharp.
0345529057|5.0|i couldn't find a comment or description saying if it had the original covers but it DOES so im really happy
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great movie! Love pre-ordering!  Don't have to do another thing and it is in my mailbox<br />As soon as it comes out.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|All it took was going through the first level and I was board. Snooze sleep yawn crap controls and such blah.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Treasure Island. No matter how many times I read this, it never fails to entertain. This book is the definition of a classic.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a very interactive game w hours of enjoyment.  I love the competition and activities. I love the choices of different horses and all the co extras.  It's very easy to level up and succeed.
0425263908|5.0|all of your books I purchased for a friend, per her request, she said to let you know they were great, thank you
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|It's wonderful to have the movies on DVD.  I haven't checked out the bonus DVD yet, but it's cool it's there.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This has been such an emotional book. It is hard to describe something so conflicting can be such an emotional rollercoaster. Definitely going to read more from Colleen Hoover.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This music is amazing and a great option for anybody that enjoys clasical music, or liked the movie Les Miserables.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I loaded this app on my Kindle and am really enjoying it. Great stress reliever when I find myself having to wait on something or someone...keeps my mind off waiting.
B0069SG4W0|5.0|firstly, a good turntable is required. with mine the vinyl is dead quiet . secondly, a 45 rpm lp of LA Woman helps appreciation of this album. the sound on a good system is much better than any other doors album. the drum kit is wonderfully miked.<br />Robbie can be heard taking risks and having trouble finishing a riff on guitar which takes you along as he polishes it on released issue. IF you already love this album, IF you enjoy jimmy reed then this is a rare opportunity. if none of these \\"IF\\"s apply then perhaps you should buy another album.
B0001I562I|5.0|this is one of the best family movies ever made, a warm, happy and good ending.  i have purchase several of these movies and given them to families as gifts, i just cant think of enough good things to say about this movie.  greatest disney movie ever made. thank you so much
6305426651|2.0|I specifically put a DVD version of this in my cart and ended getting a VHS copy..and when it got available i just went ahead and ordered thinking what I would get was the DVD , I got the VHS.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i love it the game is fun just dont understand how to go from one screen to the other have to hit the screen a lot of times dont know where i will end up
B007EW9ISM|2.0|The 2 stars is for the aesthetics. The thickness and its silicone casing is a refreshing change from the typical stylus. The problem is its functionality. The small space between the metal tip and the rubber that encases it causes too many unwanted actions from my tablet when using it. Unwanted zooming, broken up words when using the swype, and having to press too hard and too much on the tablet to get it to register. Eliminate that gap and none of these things would be an issue and this would probably be a 4 star review. It's too bad too. The pen shaped styluses are so boring...
1603580557|5.0|Dana Meadows makes systems thinking approachable and engaging.  Much of the other writing is for hard core systems engineers and can be pedantic and somewhat unapproachable.  A great text to read and re-read.
B009YU62H2|3.0|This album was just okay for me.  I have been a fan since Badmotorfinger and own all their albums.  It all comes down to personal preference, listen to it, if you like it, get it.  If you are a Chris Cornell fan but you don't own his solo album &#34;Euphoria Morning&#34; give it a listen, I think it is some of his best work and would give it 5 stars all day long.
B0018TLRTU|5.0|Don't waste your time downloading these videos online.  Get the whole collection here for way cheaper and much better viewing and listening quality.  You won't be sorry.
0307341550|5.0|This woman can really write!  It is so refreshing to see some different plots in fiction.  She's channeling James M. Cain, David Goodis, and Jim Thompson in what briefly became film noir but her stuff is so new!  You get hooked and keep on reading.
1594744475|4.0|Such a cute book with lots of great guides and pictures that are good examples of bento box making.  I do wish there were more actual recipes for things though.  Overall pleased with the book, its a hit in our kitchen.
B000VPPMXO|1.0|I bought two virtual lighthouses, when I tried use they were defective. Contacting iRobot for replace took a long time in a very slow customer reply. Very time iRobot look for excuses to not do that is very simple they sold a defective product they need just replace, sound so easy the problem to me I don't understand the matter. The main problem was that I bought but travel abroad and was writing from an outside country. Finally they agree in replace, but I need post inside the country ok that is reasonable but impossible to me in that moment. In the very moment that I return I tried again make the return and now for my great surprise, instead of just replace that would be fair and easy I receive a reply (again a very slow reply from custom service) inform that I was beyond replacement period.<br />Worth to mention that:<br /><br />- Companies that show respect for the customer usually doesn't make hard replace broken products actually usually they do a RECALL when they know that is a quality control problem;<br /><br />- This problem an epic fail of a product out of the box and very restrict rules to fix their qualities problems should make every one thing about, maybe neato robotics is an opnion for product that simply doesn't work and companies that abandon you; (A fail out-of-the-box make you feel a foo, and a lack of support make you be sure that the companies foolish you. Think about Does you want be foolish? Maybe avoid buy from iRobot is wise)<br /><br />- Although I understand that iRobot will say simply that I was beyond the replacement period. Everyone should judge for yourselves. I contact in the period, they knew that was a batch with problems, sent a broken item was their entire responsibility, they never mention that was a period to send and i made all things as soon as possible to me, despite all this iRobot stick to his police.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|While I enjoyed reading this book, I found it may have had too many killings!  The story line did keep one guessing as to &#34;who did it&#34; right up to the very end.  I will read more of Lee Child's books, just to see how his main character continues his life.  I would recommend to those who enjoy mysteries.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 4 times. I never tire of it. One of Nicholson's best roles. Great classic movie!
B00BSD92XE|5.0|I have watched 4 episodes on History Channel.<br />What a great new series.<br />The writing, the cast, the locations.<br />High quality production all around.<br />I look forward to the next episode.
B00BEJL3IY|4.0|Jack the Giant Slayer was a lot of really good clean fun with some top notch acting. This beautifully cinematic adventure has several similarities to the classic tale we've all heard but also a lot of really great changes. It is every predictable and very cheesy but it's overall a really great movie to take the family to or if you just want a pleasant night at the movies. There is a considerably high amount of people getting killed or eaten but it's all mostly implied and everything is very light hearted. I would defiantly recommend seeing this.
0152023984|1.0|As other reviewers warn in reviews better and more complete than this one,  this translation is disappointing. Read the book, but use a different translation. I was drawn to this book by the beautiful quotations I've seen citing it. But the language used by this translator is nowhere near as beautiful.
B0043HA1K0|5.0|With John Legend and The Roots it can't get any better!  This entire album brings back some great soulful music!!!
B009DH2PP4|5.0|WARNING:  print version is far, far better than Kindle.  charts, etc.<br /><br />read it three times , maybe eight, make some beer, OK it's great!  (apologies to Dr. Suess)<br /><br />everything you need to get a grip.  then subscribe to HomeBrewTalk  (HBT)  and watch how all this information plays out in real time.  Palmer is a terrific teacher,  and there is  a wide community of homebrewers around the world who are using this text, among others, as a launch pad.
B005GQ5HB0|4.0|This is a very intelligent and well written book. It is a story about pride, power, love, cruelty, and prejudice set shortly after the second world war in Germany. It's a tragedy in which we are capable of playing all of its characters. It contains valuable lessons for us all.
0307887448|5.0|I loved this book, it was one of my favorites reads in a long time....I read it all in 4 days, couldn't put it down!
B001KYJA6K|5.0|The most superb mix of sound; human voice juxtaposed against magnificent interpretation and subtle instrumentation; a must for music lovers of this era
B009TZBEKW|4.0|The entire album keeps you movin!  Calvin Harris has collaborated with great artists.  My favorite songs are Sweet Nothing and Let's Go.
B00122FTQA|5.0|I love Enya and have for many years; her awesome lyrics and melodies save my life over and over.<br />Carol
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|I have purchased several of these LED bulbs from Lighting Ever that includes the 60watt replacement 10watt LED bulb along with the 50watt replacement 6watt LED bulb.  I just recently discovered my 50watt replacement warm-white LED bulb  cover has broken for no apparent reason. (It was purchased on Jan 17, 2013 so I have had it just under two months). Trying to deal with the manufacturer customer service has been very challenging and I have given up.  Fortunately Amazon was very courteous and helpful when I explained the situation to them. I will try out another company when ordering LED bulbs in the future.  I only hope the other bulbs that I purchased, made by Lighting Ever, will last as long as they should under normal use, as I do not expect them to honor their warranty on these bulbs.
034580404X|2.0|Well, I finished Fifty Shades of my Life I Will Never Get Back. I read all of the first book. It was alright. Second book was about 60/40 read/skimmed because, sweet zombie Jesus, I can only read about so much sex before I get bored. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY does the grown-up 3-4 times a day every single day for months on end unless they have a problem and need to hit a meeting. (or am I just old and bitter?) I'm walking funny just thinking about it. The 3rd Book...uuuuughghghghghhhhh. It was about 30/70 read/skimmed because at that point I was invested and couldn't just stop and put myself out of my misery. If I never read about peering from under lashes, hungry looks, chiseled jawlines, darkening eyes, murmers, giggles and Anastasia Steele's \\"Inner Goddess\\" again, it will be too soon.<br />Look, it's not the worst thing that was ever written, but...yeah. I'm glad it's over.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was an unexpected book. I am not sure what I expected, but this book took me in directions I hadn't thought of. A sure sign of a good book is that you can't put it down and I read this in a few days.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|If you are familiar with the book or original movie, this version may be a little too artistic and takes a few liberties. Not a bad movie just different.  As usual Keira Knightley and Jude Law were awesome and the costumes were out of this world!!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I just put a bunch of apps that I have on my phone onto my Kindle Fire and they work great!
B001D0BLTA|2.0|Movie review: fully subjective.<br />&#34;Duckie&#34;'s role is played well, but that's about it in my opinion. The rest of the acting and the movie isn't as great &#34;for me&#34;. It's also really weird that minors girls are going into pubs with a bouncer kicking out anyone under 21 at the entrance. It's an old movie, so folks will get the &#34;no cell phone...&#34;, but the pub stuff: same rules existed in the 80s already.
B00AB6LHJQ|5.0|When I heard that HBO is making a series based on this book, as they have done with George R. R. Martin's work (Game of Thrones), I picked it up on Kindle to get a foretaste. HBO, I imagine, will do a fabulous job with it; there is a huge wealth of material here that they can completely dizz out on, and I hope it will be as quirky and weird and humorous, as light and tongue-in-cheek and yet as profound, as Gaiman's book.<br /><br />I deliberately didn't visualize the characters too finely, nor did I try to make the whole thing gel in my mind, because I want to wait for HBO's casting and treatment. But I enjoyed reading this novel very much and am very much looking forward to the series.<br /><br />It was a real mind trip. Somewhat slapstick, somewhat shamanic, at turns irreverent, respectful, banal, bizarre. I'll read it again...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is one of my favorite shows. Heard people talking about it so i of course had to check it out.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a fun game that will kill a few minutes here and there. It plays great on kindle fire with the touch screen controls.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I just put a bunch of apps that I have on my phone onto my Kindle Fire and they work great!
B002L3ARRU|5.0|This is a really good comedy. The plot is simple and predictable but there's something that just works very well about that movie. I believe it's part of the Prime movies.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As in season 1 and 2, season 3 just makes the series better.<br />I hope it goes on for many more seasons
0425264351|4.0|Jack Reacher is an ex-military police and confirmed drifter. Stopping off in small town Georgia he finds himself a suspect in a murder. Entangled in small town corruption he stays to find out what is going on in Margrave. A good story with an explosive ending. Jack Reacher is one of the best new characters to come along.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|First, I'm very glad I got this when it was $5.00.  I read the first book in 3 days and am well into the 2nd.  I didn't think it was something I would care to read, but I had the chance to read the first book free with Prime and couldn't put it down.  So $5 later, I'm hooked!  I do not find it to be gory since the author doesn't go into deep descriptions.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I just put a bunch of apps that I have on my phone onto my Kindle Fire and they work great!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Great addition to the movie library.  These will make the rounds I am sure of it.  Nothing like a British accent to make you think you're not watching a soap opera.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My old kindle charger when out. Was sent a new one with in two days and it was free!! Great customer service!!
B00A2WPK06|3.0|Sound was TERRIBLE, but the stars were great! It was wonderful to see these younger versions of actors, and †heir corny lines----
B004TI5N38|5.0|I enjoy David Baldacci's books, have yet to read one that wasn't excellent.  I would recommend his books to everyone.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this series after watching the first movie I fell in love with the series. Very suspenseful and action packed. Suzanne Collins knows how to write a great book. Best series of all time
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I got introduced into this game when my wife asked me if I could control this Beach Buggy's obstinate vehicle. I found out that the best way was using touch controls for steering by simple touch on the left or right rather than using tilt controls which she had attempted to control the vehicle on the beach. I must say \\"wow\\" and got hooked onto this game in an instant. I found out that the graphics are very nice for a free game like this and no irritating advertisements either. - Thanks to developers for that. Hope it stays that way!<br /><br />It's amazing world of crazy beach driving to have fun and number of ways you can drive your beach buggy vehicle. Just keep driving, bashing, crashing into things as you go. Collect coins on the way for power-ups and vehicle mods as you progress into the game. It makes me remember playing [[ASIN:B000034DCF CTR: Crash Team Racing]] game on PlayStation 1. Comparatively, The graphics are top-notch and plays smoothly on Samsung Galaxy Tab with NVIDIA tegra optimized graphics, Even with the highest resolution settings the game plays smoothly and adds tons of fun.<br /><br />The goal is simple. Get out to the beach with you beach buggy vehicle to get as far as you can in a limited amount of time provided initially and collect more power-ups and reach certain checkpoints that provided to you on the way and you keep going and going bashing all the things on the way - Lot's of fun.<br /><br />The reason it loses one star as it seems hard to play in the beginning with the little amount of time that is provided to you and the game ends too quickly frustrating some players. But with little bit of practice you still can keep playing for pure fun.<br /><br />For a free game this is definitely a keeper!
B0087HT36U|5.0|funnnnnnnnnn game I really liked it and I am alomost finished with it and I really liked it so much
B0086700CM|1.0|Worst game I have ever played in my life! When you try to disable it, it is showing up on my device page and when I try to disable it says application not found! I do not reccomend it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Never thought I would read and enjoy a Steven King novel. I loved this book.<br />Loved the way he took you to the past, present and the future.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|It proved one thing which is that it doesn't matter in what part of the work force you're in you can find some willing to drink, do drugs or any other thing that makes them feel as though they are in total control and not even realize the consequences.
B00846WWVM|5.0|This is a super awesome game which consistently seen to have very high rating on Google Play for months. I had played this on my Galaxy tab 10.1 and love it. I am happy to see that the same game is now available on Amazon APP store and I can enjoy the same on my original Kindle fire too.<br /><br />The game graphics is super smooth and the unique world created by the developers truly gives players a pleasurable experience to play this game. This is fast game with time sensitive goals to save the creatures from fire. It has good sound effects and lovely setting with cute looking characters and everyone in my family loves it.<br /><br />Aiming the cannon to spray water at times can be challenging but what's a game without some challenge? - The replay value of this game is very good. You can skip a level if you are stuck. There are no questionable permissions to report and safe to play.<br /><br />Many thanks goes to the developer \\"Mediocre AB\\" and Amazon App store to offer this as FAOTD. If you love cute characters and like physics based family fun games this is the game to get.<br /><br />Super Awesome family fun! - Download it today! you will love it too!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It is great to have all the features that it provides.<br />I use it mostly when I travel or when I have something special and I need a back up alarm so I won't oversleep.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Ordered for my grandson.  He loves it and enjoys playing it from my Kindle.  He has asked his parents to purchase him a Kindle so that he can play the game when he is not at grandma.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|At first when I got the game, I felt like had just wasted a buck a stupid game about backflips. But it turns out, I MADE A REALLY GOOD DESISION!!!! It's really hard at first, and then I kept on playing it, and it was amazing!!! I read some reviews, and a lot of them were talking about how the game is terrible, and how you can only play in the gym. Don't believe them. They are either lying, or they don't play it enough, because you do get all the levels, you just have to earn them.<br />  Okay, I'll admit it. Maybe I'm overreacting a little bit about cool that this game is, but I'm telling you! It is totally worth getting. I hope you like it as much as I do. Okay, I hope you enjoy it if you get it too. I wouldn't lie to you. Thanks for reading!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|reviews were something not to ignore.  Had to have it and am glad I got it.  Great story line and the fact that not every actor wasn't recognizable was a treat.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is hard to put down once that first dragon hatches.  Wonderful to find a game free of violence.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Action, character development, some downright amusing scenes, great special effects, and supurb casting all come together in this film to provide two hours worth of quality Star Trek.  It's not your granddad's Star Trek, but that's not always a bad thing, right?  I'm looking forward to the new movie coming out.
B00634GHJA|5.0|With this app it made it easy enough for me to transfer my pictures from my computer to my Kindle.  The directions were step by step from the dowloading to the transfer.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game so much I got some of my friends at work hooked on it too. Great game
B007REV4T8|4.0|I wouldn't have given it as high a rating than some of the others I read.  It has been outdone by a lot of the more recent Bond films were better in action and content.  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it primarily because I'm hooked on the Bond stuff
B0094BB4TW|5.0|no better way to stay caught up with your friends on FB, easy to use, a good app. could use some tweaks but overall solid.
B003GX5CWY|5.0|'nuff said.  I don't know how many times I've watched this movie over the years but it is still an all-time favorite of mine.  Much worth the 9.99 to be able to watch it whenever I want (except for on my Android devices.... )
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Make it easy to read the Bible and connect with others who are interested in knowing about God and his wisdom.  I love the fact that even if I am unable to read the scriptures can be read to me.  I like the fact that I can highlight some versus that mean a lot to me and even provide me with being able to write comments.  The Bible is on my Kindle and also my computer.  Thank you for this app.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show gave me hope in television again . It is the best show ever! This is something il watch the rest of my life the characters are so unique and make me want to know more
B008M721MS|2.0|so i was on skype with my girlfriend and all of a sudden it turn off and and keep on saying skype has stop i even uninstalled it and downloaded it again and still doesnt work and this app they provide for the kindle fire hd
B005IQZB14|1.0|I wanted to like this book.  I even tried to like it.  Had there been any semblance of an epiphany at the end I would have given it at least two stars.  Alas, the book is poorly-written and not really about anything except the author's need to indulge herself and bore the reader describing how sad she is over her mother's death and how lonely and horny she feels in between hooking up with guys and booze after her solitary hikes.  Don't waste your time.
B0035LJF2U|4.0|I know the video is dated, but as a fan I still enjoyed listening to their music. Looking forward for some more music from U2
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|The was well worth the price. The hints are fabulous &amp; the storyline is also good. Had no problems downloading it on my kindle fire HD. No technical issues whatsoever. Very satisfied with the game.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This season is the most unique of them all I wish I could watch it again and again. I hope they make many many more seasons they just never ever get old
0061801313|5.0|I just started reading the series, and it is amazing. Many twists and turns. There are also many secrets to hide in Rosewood. :)
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is RIDIC funny!!!! Seth MacFarlane, Mila Kunic and Mark Wahlberg are SOOOO hilarious!!!! Not for the easily offended as it is SOOO not politically correct, and that's fabulous! Seriously, may be the funniest movie I've ever seen! Seriously doesn't matter how many times I watch it!
B0087GZ8YW|2.0|I'm not familiar with Ian Rankin's work so this was a first. I found it hard work reading and Rebus is not a character to whom I could warm.  To my mind, anti-heros have to be carefully and thoughtfully constructed. Of course, this may well be the perception by a marked fan base, given the number of books listed where Rebus is the central character. Unfortunately, based on this reading experience, I would not be one of those fans.
B008Q09K2U|5.0|This is my first John Corey and Nelson DeMille novel.  I kind of wish I'd read the others first but this one was recommended to me.<br />I love that DeMille uses real events to write his stories around.  I love the smart-mouth and smart John Corey.  Well written and easy to read.  Characters who are enjoyable and believably complex.  My favourite quote from the book was in reference to Bucky - 'he had been in the deception business so long, he really didn't know what was real and what he was making up.  Right or wrong was a little blurry too.  Plus he enjoyed the game'.  I think that might happen more often that we would like to think to our covert brothers and sisters.  A great knowledge of Yemen and Yemenis.  Novels such as this are not just a great read but educational too.  Can't wait to read all the ones I didn't know about!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I chose this review because the author went into way to much detail on every aspect which was not sufficient. Now I hope the movie itself isn't.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love this show and I don't know what I will do once it ends. If you like this show I would recommend the books, which include more drama and detail. I really recommend the show
0307888908|5.0|I first came across this book in Dymocks in Sydney Australia, struggling with making my first real career choice and having previously watched interviews by Ben and Reid i decided i would give it a read. That was one of the pivotal moments in my life. The A,B,Z strategy to risk is something i had been applying all along however I didn't realize i was doing it. After reading the book i was able to teach this skill of risk management to other people. Ive bought two copies to give to friends and family who have been struggling with making major career moves and getting back on their feet. I cant reccomend this enough. if you couple this book with some of the talks online that reid and ben give you can achieve some really great things.
B005J2UM9S|4.0|It was a good movie. It wasn't a movie were things were jumping out all over the place, but it was still scary.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I thought that season #1 was great, but this was better. The transformation of Tara has been very intriguing. But what will Opee do???
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I found my boyfriend on here and he is very cute<br />He is nice<br />I have not met him because he lives in Florida and I live in Delaware
B005K01VZS|4.0|A great insightful read into the lives of people who live out their faith in very different ways.  The author lets us into his journey of getting to know a Rabbi and a Pastor with growing appreciation for lives well spent in serving others.
B00701897I|5.0|I thought it was a very good movie. For an animation it had great color and the subjects looked almolst real.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Hey Amazon. I love this app it's the best! I text anyone as long as they have an account. I just got it recently so I don't have many contacts. You know how not many people have a device like a kindle fire or anything? An  maybe your bff doesn't but u do? Well there's a hilarious robot that is a contact when u first create ur account. U can even send pics to anyone. Don't think ur wasting time reading this. It's an amazing app, Katie H.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Really fell in love with the characters in this book<br /> It felt like they were friends of mine great book
B0049VZ222|5.0|i played the walking dead game for ios (also for android and other platforms) first before watching the series. The game is same premise but completely different characters in another part of the country. Game all based around making choices around the situation, who to lie to, etc. I fell in love with the game and had to watch the series and it did not disappoint. Knowing the plot from the game allowed me to jump right into the series easily. A+++
B002WV5A9G|4.0|If you are a fan of the original Star Trek series you will like this movie.  Its a prequel to the original series and tells the story of how the crew came together.  It was well made, the plot was good and the acting was good as well.
B0000A02U2|5.0|Saw this movie in high school, and had to get this movie again to revisit the laughs and nonsense that only Belushi can pull off on screen.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this new game I got. It's so realistic. I will not uninstall this for a long time. And again I like this game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|epic. all I need is a simple calculator. that is easy. to use on my tablet. I can use this app anywhere.  in class in a restrraunt and at home when I don't feel like calculating.  great job on the app.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Enjoyed it.  Very action packed.  Not the best Bond movie but we enjoyed it.  They went through a lot of cars.
B005GET768|5.0|Like a lot of people, I came to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock stories from the other adaptations of the character. Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd century, The Great Mouse Detective, the BBCs recent Sherlock series, etc.<br /><br />This is the original, and I must say it is fantastic. If you are a fan of the character, but are worried that it was written so long ago you may not like it - just stop worrying about that right now. These are good stories, and more than worth your time - and having read them I'm astounded at how faithful the other adaptations I've seen have been to this material. I almost have a deeper appreciation for the newer works because of this.<br /><br />tl;dr - read these, they're good. Oh, and get the audible version too - it'll sync with this - the one's read by Derek Jacobi are the best. But there's one read by ... ALAN CUMMING!!!
B0009UC81A|5.0|This is a classic movie for anyone who enjoys John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd.  What a team that can make you laugh!  The energy that these two have together is wonderful.  This movie tells the story of two misfits who try to do the right thing in the end.  Recommend this movie!
B003RWT7UC|5.0|It is a great book about neuroplasticity. I loved all the chapters and it has a great scientific background. So I really recommend this book not only for doctors but also for general people. It is a book about how great things the brain can achieve.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an excellent book...the government's philosophy over the districts was intriguing and sad. It made me empathize the peoples' plight and I wondered how I would be able to bring children into a world where they would have to be sacrificed. I was enraptured and had a hard time putting the book down.
1451695195|5.0|He writes very well.  Except that it's more on the new age side, as there's no mention of who this God of love is, no mention of Jesus Christ. It's a good book to break the barrier for a atheist to consider the possibility of afterlife but not so good as a theology book. Enjoyed the book very much.
0810979772|3.0|My teenage daughter likes this series.  She asks for every new book in the szeries as soon as it comes out and reads the books in their entirety eithin a day or two.
B000I9W08I|5.0|This is a great movieand by far the best rendition of Hello Dolly!  Barbara Streisand is a great actress and fabulous singer!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love that my favorite game is now on kindle too. Fun and entertainment all in one. I love it
B00B2V66VS|2.0|his game is so much fun and a lot better then the original, but now that I've had it for a while on my kindle, it refuses to open and I really don't want to restart but, I guess I will if I have to:(
B006PHD0RW|5.0|fabulous game play... works great, easy at first but gets to your level pretty fast worth the download. thanks for the fun game
0307740919|5.0|I have long been a huge fan of Toni Morrison's work. She is truly an honest writer. At times, I've found some of her novels difficult to read, not only because of the complexity of her style, but also because of the painful and heartbreaking subjects she addresses. Yet, it's how she traverses this difficult terrain that is the essence of her talent. Topics many would rather forget or ignore, bloody history, taboos, Morrison sheds light on what was, what is, and what can be.<br /><br />I don't know about anyone else, but for me, for turning that first page, and then the next and the next, until I can't help but to keep turning to the very end, I'm rewarded. It all falls into place. Home, like some of her other novels has helped answer questions for me that I didn't even know I had.<br /><br />While reading Home, and following Frank and Cee's perilous journey, there were other questions that arose, questions like, \\"what does the heart and mind do with this kind of pain, with the anger that surely comes?\\" And Morrison, in her masterful way, shows how.
0307346617|5.0|with out a doubt the best zombie book i have read.<br />great plot & charactors , very literate, very well written.<br />buy it , read it !
B009K0P10K|4.0|Revenge is an exciting TV series. The lead lady Emily goes back to the series Brothers and Sisters, also ABC. She is a wonderful actress. The plot is basically, Emily is the victim of some tragic losses and she is trying to pay back to all of these powerful and rich people who conspire to kill her father.
B00846WWVM|3.0|sprinkle is ok . the basics of it is put out all the fire in the city before you run out of water its kind of  like a puzzle. I got it as free app of the day I would not pay for it.
0345803493|5.0|The BEST book ever. I didnt want it to end! i was so sad. but i love the books regardless and will def recommend this book.
1400049628|5.0|Very useful for those who want to survive run-ins with the walking dead, saved my life more than once. Survive!
B000FCK65W|5.0|I loved the story and Brooklyn, besides being where my husband was reared, was adopted by me. Very happy to recommend my favorite boro in New York City.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|this game is similer to the others but much much better scubba divers hidden treshers and lots of fish you don't have to do tilt you can use your finger to. love Mr.bean
0345803507|5.0|The BEST book ever. I didnt want it to end! i was so sad. but i love the books regardless and will def recommend this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games there are so many when I'm tired of one I go to the next there are different ones
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a great game app for preschoolers up that is family and goal oriented.  Very addictive and great graphics.  Worth the time you will spend playing it over and over.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Cussing and cursing from start to finish, this book is written by an author bent on portraying the savagery and ugliness of war. In a word -- the truth. An avid reader of military books and war history, I bought this expecting to read about SEALs and their exploits and heroism in Iraq and I wasn't disappointed. But this book offers more -- a rare and vivid look at their families and how they cope with the absence, and sometimes loss, of their sons and spouses.<br /><br />The only thing tragic about Chris is that he died in the US in peacetime while helping a fellow vet cope with the stresses of war. To Taya, I give you my smartest salute and I'm sorry for your loss. If it's any consolation, your husband was a hero.
0062124293|5.0|Super funny... def recommend to my ladies out there!!! Takes me back to when i was young and learning new things!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|loved it great game to play worth the 2.99 i paid for it lots nice things to find like all the 5 g games i have played
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I have never used open (semi in this case) headphones and after getting this, I started to know about instrument separation and sound staging audiophile kind of stuff. With such low cost, I really appreciate the whole semi open concept of headphone and my next purchase would be ps1000. If you never tried open headphone, you can start with it, if you really passionate about complete range of music & not only bass. Though the bass on this is fantastic and will not overpower other frequencies.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|Great Story!<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this story.  The story line was easy to follow and the author makes her readers feel the conflict and emotions her characters go through.  One of the main characters the wicked and notorious rake and the other main character a total opposite of himself.  Two desperate people find each other and to their surprise fall in love.
0345803485|5.0|The BEST book ever. I didnt want it to end! i was so sad. but i love the books regardless and will def recommend this book.
B003Q97D48|5.0|This is an addicting series!  Once you start, you won't stop!  It's unlike the books, so keep that in mind.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Another very special Disney production great for children but also entertaining for discerning adults. The special effects are most impressive.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|My 8 yr old loves the game and so do I!  Really gets you thinking.  Good for kids and adults because you really have to use your brain plus it's fun at the same time!
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|So I love the game, addicting mario-kart sorta style racing game. And I originally submitted a review of 5 stars. But now that I've used it plenty, the lag has gotton to me. I have crashed so many times using this app, not even tuning background apps. Just this, it will lag to the point of completely freezing and having to re-boot my Kindle Fire. It's so frustrating!
0439295017|3.0|This is a great book to have if you are a Harry Potter fan.  The quality of the book wasn't as it was listed, and I ended up purchasing it new.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Enjoyed watching while walking on treadmill.  Makes the workout go quicker.  Big fan of Michael Chiklis, was surprised by his role
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I use this app every day.  This has everything you could think of.  It's fun to browse.  So many choices.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Story line gets kind of dull, a lot less action, many good characters have died off.  Feeling like I am reading it because I am too far into the series and have to keep going... Maybe the next book will be better but I'm not holding my breath.
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|Highly addicting and fun.  Easy to do a day marathon with this show.  Unlike the book series is major ways.
B003QSPTAY|5.0|I watched as a kid and now mine are too. Wholesome and family friendly, no scary &#34;bad guys&#34; either. A keeper!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it has work awesome for me love everything about it if you need a Bible for your kindle I would say this would be the one for you :)
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Its kind of like minecraft but a lot funnier so create job but it needs a update and how do I reset my progress I messed up
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|I watched this movie because Helen Hunt was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.  It's not one I would pick out on my own, but I didn't hate it.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I really don't have anything to complain about here.  And that is saying something.  I got this game as the free app of the day.  The graphics are amazing and there are options for things you can build.  BUT, I have been looking at the minecraft game on line and it seems as though they have logs, real fire, and darker wood.  DEVELOPERS, IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADD THESE THINGS I will buy any of your latest versions and apps.  Seriously.  I would just love those options so I can build a fireplace, and a log cabin mansion! :)
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Being a huge film fan, it was remarkable that I first heard of this movie one week ago! Browsing through the films at my local video store, I came upon this title. The cover had Roger Ebert calling it 'Magnificent.' Well, this can be good or bad, depending how much faith you have in Roger's reviews. So, I took it home and watched it. Then, watched it again. Then, watched it again with the commentary. Then, ran out and bought a copy. The non-cgi cinematography in this film is epic! I am thinking, who the heck is Tarsem? Did he apprentice under David Lean? 'Lawrence Of Arabia' imagery came first to mind, witnessing this spectacle. And the interplay between Catinca and Lee Pace, is all 'non-acting.' Their relationship on screen, is for real. I found the story line, to be a bit vague the first time through. But, was rewarded with quite a bit more insight watching it again. All in all, a tremendous film, that obviously went unheralded upon its initial release. I quickly obtained Tarsem's other films, and greatly enjoyed THE CELL and MIRROR MIRROR. So Roger, I agree completely. Magnificent!
B002GSXKN8|5.0|My grandson loves it. He watches them over and over. Best gift I could have got him.Keeps him occupied and that makes us all happy to see him happy!!!!
B009HNDCC4|4.0|I love this series.  It's not quite as good as the first season, but I still enjoy watching it.  Entertaining.
B006HL9G10|4.0|I love the app! The only issue is that it doesn't vibrate as long as a real one would. thanks!
034580404X|5.0|My wife loved these books. I couldn't find them in the stores anywhere when they first came out (they were always sold out), so I did what I always do when I can't find something and got on Amazon. I found them right away and they were shipped promptly to my doorstep. My wife was so surprised and excited when I gave these to her. I have no interest in the books, but she thoroughly enjoyed them!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Good book! Couldn't put it down.<br />A must read for the Grisham fans.<br />Can't wait for his next book to come out.
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|I watched the DVD years ago and love the movie.  The blue-ray proivdes such a great color/sound, in addition to the fun nature of the movie.  Definately worth to buy and keep..
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|great fun game with great physics and unique game play. I play all day and do not get bored it has good graphics. if u like puzzles and interactive design you will like this
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Brilliant story,couldnt put it down. Be warned, it ends in a cliffhanger and if you're impatient like me, only read this once the fourth book is out. And hopefully that is soon!<br />The story has now advanced to the next generation, and is more focused on Sebastian. Good read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I downloaded this on my phone as well as the Kindle Fire... Could play for hours if I really wanted to but obviously that is never possible. Can't wait for Temple Run 3 which I sure is not far behind this one...
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie! Fascinating look at animals and humans interacting. Ending will make you think and ponder what is real and what is not. Highly recommended!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Saw it when it was on sale, just had to grab it for my husband who loves this collection! I watched it once with him and fell in love with this! Really powerful movies, and it actually shows how each characters change over time. Highly recommended!
0345803485|5.0|Great series! You won't be sorry about reading this series of stories.  I love that my purchases are shipped so quickly.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Hate the fact that you would have to buy more coins if you run out. Hard to explain to a 4.5 year old that she is out of coins and your not buying her any more... :(
B006LSZECO|4.0|When I started this book I wasn't sure I would love it. It's one of those stories that keeps building and building until you get to the very end, then it's WOW!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent, first-hand account of a truly dedicated, selfless warrior. His transparent, personal, biography bears his heart and soul and emotion. The included perspective of his wife and views into his marriage from his perspective, including the conflicts, are heart gripping. Reading this, following his tragic death through the hands of one he was reaching out to help, makes it an even more impactful reading experience. Definitely a recommended read for mature audiences.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|My first thought was to generously give this movie three stars, on the basis that: while it is similar (but inferior) to Alien, it is much more ambitious. The defense of the poor execution and conception would be in the degree of difficulty (in telling a survival-horror story against a SF-creation-myth backdrop). But that defense doesn't wash, because the SF story is a fake-out: we ultimately understand as little about the universe of Prometheus as we do about the Alien. Since there actually is no explanation here, there can be no justification for ending up with a story as loose and floppy as this one. Perhaps Ridley Scott wants to make a more cerebral type of movie now; if this is the outcome, then I think that decision is a pity. Alien feels tense, urgent, and mysterious & has a definite point of view. I didn't love it, but it's an excellent movie. Prometheus resolves to the same type of hidden danger creature feature, but without those qualities and with: empty pretension, meaningless character detail, and (unintentional?) comedy where a \\"climax\\" involves outrunning a spaceship. I watched it through to the end partly to find the (non-existent) answers, but mostly because Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron play their characters as though they might develop into something interesting (they do not). But where I was watching, everyone else gave up halfway through (and I can't blame them).<br /><br />It seems to be an ambitious failure, but I have to ask why such an ambitious failure is necessary. Apparently, Ridley Scott was always surprised that fans weren't keen to know the origin of the original alien humanoids. The explanation for that is very simple: it's cooler not to explain everything (especially if it turns out to be this, or midi-chlorians).
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Between my wife and I we have played for hours on end!! Several different variations of this game are available and I think we have them all!! Great for a free app...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|high quality graphic simulator game for the horde lover! really beautifully designed and fun to play!<br />i played it when it first came out and it was over quickly. but they really face bade some wonderful imrpovements since then.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much, it was a great ending to a wonderful trilogy. Though the ending left me wanting more ( I never wanted it to end!) I feel Suzanne Collins did an amazing job wrapping up this series!  I recommend this trilogy to all with a warning they are not feel good books (90% of the time very sad).
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Excellent movie filled with action, killing and beautiful women. Daniel Craig is the ultimate James Bond, not only is he smooth and devinere with the ladies he brings a seriousness to the screen as an agent. Great fight scenes, great plot excellent movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have yet to be disappointed by one of Nicholas Sparks' books.  I like when there are little twists to a book that are unpredictable, but not completely impossible.  Another great one! Thank you.
B00ARX2W24|5.0|This is one of the best Herb Alpert cd ever. It came out in 1982. All the songs on this cd are great. Well done on the remasterning on this disc. Real pure Herb Alpert sound. You will enjoy this cd.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once I finished Hunger Games I could not wait to dive right into this one, and it did not disappoint.  While reading this book I felt like I was there with Katniss, Peeta and all of the other tributes. The second book really throws a curve ball at you, which honestly, I never saw coming!  This has to be the best book series I have ever read!
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|This is a great book for those who will be visiting or living in Australia.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|Loved this movie as a kid and after watching it tonight I still love it!  The main thing I was curious about was the quality of the blu ray since this is a 25 year old movie. I'm very impressed with the remastering and thought the video and audio were really done well. The picture quality is great.<br /><br />The movie itself is a great enjoyable time. I think kids and adults will really like it a lot if you've never seen it.  You can't really compare it to any other fantasy movie and it has good action along with a lot of humor. I really hope no one ever tries to remake this classic.  There's just something about movies from the 80's that are just magical.
B00BNNJHXO|3.0|This albums gets some seriously mixed feedback from me.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />The musicians in Soilwork (with the exception, at times, of their drummer) always come across as surely knowing how to play their instruments. At least on this album. Being metal music, you're sure to hear something poignant in every track and their lyrics tend towards eloquence without the pretension of many of their peers. The instrumentation is also very progressive, which I love. When your rhythm guitarist writes his/her riffs with more skill than the average lead guitarist, you've got my attention. Also, if there's something these people do very well, it's intellectually-sound blasphemy. In the songs where they call out mainstream religion (and there are quite a few on this album) they lyrically tear it to strips, almost every last insidious and underhanded mind-trick, breaking neither sweat nor rhyme and meter. I love the statement they make with &#34;Parasite Blues,&#34; about the church's misrepresentation of Jesus of Nazareth, calling them out for drowning out his real message and using his mere visage to enslave. I think this is all very important in our society, since most people are too hypnotized by religion to notice all the harm it does them (if no one were pointing it out, that is.) And it doesn't end with religion. Politics, government, popular psychology - lyrically speaking, it's open FARKing season! On the more musical end of things, I love the grungy, muddy, turgid overdrive on their guitars. That combined with the gymnastic riff-writing they do, occasionally interspersed with acoustic (or at least very, very clean electric) guitar makes much of this album a feast for the ears.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />OH. MY. GODS. FORMULAIC. You really only need to hear about one third of this album before you've pretty much heard it all, and for writing in a style that gets monotonous very quickly, I'm shaking my head at Soilwork for making this a two-disc set. Half the time I feel like their drummer needs to be kicked repeatedly until he commits to learning a few new beats. He seriously lacks creativity. Slamming on the same two to four pieces of your kit in the same order at blisteringly fast tempos for half an album does *NOT* make you a metal drummer, and no, that occasional fill or two splitting up the halves of a verse in that format does *not* keep things interesting. I can haz complexity? Plzkthx! &#60;3 Also, as passionate and absolutely soul-carrying as a lot of their more high-pitched guitar sounds are, it's -still- all so homogenous that the only way I have of telling apart one track from another most times is that the title of each song (or something close to it) is in the lyrics of almost every song. From this band, I would like to hear a *lot* more diversity, especially rhythmically. If their guitar work were a little more distinguished, that would also be a beautiful thing.<br /><br />IMO, the best track on this album is #3 - &#34;This Momentary Bliss.&#34; Also very noteworthy are track #6, &#34;Let the First Wave Rise,&#34; track #7 &#34;Vesta,&#34; tracks 5 and 6 on discs one and two respectively &#34;The Living Infinite I&#34; and &#34;The Living Infinite II,&#34; and disc two, track 9, &#34;Parasite Blues.&#34;<br /><br />Overall this album gets a 3 out of 5 from me, two stars subtracted mostly for lack of diversity. I wouldn't recommend buying the whole thing. Get on YouTube and look for a full album preview, noting the tracks that really move you, and then buy those individually.the time I feel like their drummer needs to be kicked repeatedly until he commits to learning a few new beats.

B00A4A2N6K|1.0|The DVD is boring and tired,and her friend who is in most of it,Is Not funny and just Ghetto.I was hoping for music videos,but got some boring drag on documentry/reality crap.Its best to just stick to Friday reloaded deluxe CD,all songs I liked are from \\"Starships\\" to end of CD.It would of been better to stick with reloaded deluxe CD than Re Up,because DVD is worthless....now I have No plans to buy anymore of Niki CD's.Maybe when Nikki releases a dvd with videos I think about it.
B0085W09ME|4.0|I really love this app!  The only thing that drives me crazy is that it returns the flight times in military time.  If they would switch that to standard time, I would give it 5 stars.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Forget the take 8 years off disappointment of the Nolan Batman with this perfect adaptation.  They cracked the code with this one.
B000JQTWPO|4.0|When you need a break from the sultry, violent, dispicable that has become everyday life try this book.  It kept my interest to the end.  Almost any age can read it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Scary that it could happen.  Denzel is great as usual.  Flying portion not realistic but plot carried out very well.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|This album is just another great peice of work.  Jon and the crew are such talented song writers and it shows again in this album. I think they will have some big hits off of this one.!!
0060012234|4.0|From my blog On Starships and Dragonwings<br /><br />Title: Geography Club<br />Author: Brent Hartinger<br />Length: 240 pages<br />Genre-ish: LGBT contemporary YA<br />Rating: ★★★★☆- sweet and realistic portrayal of being a gay teen<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br /> Geography Club has a wide variety of characters with different sexual orientations (including bi-sexual, finally) and at different stages of coming out. This also includes straight teens who have a range of reactions to finding out their friends aren't straight. Geography Club also brings all these characters together in a believable way ;-).<br />There is a very sweet portrayal of developing love between two young men, along with all the problems that high school relationships often run into.<br />Geography Club tackles the outsider dilemma pretty well and recognizes that there isn't an easy fix to the cliques in a real high school.<br />The writing in Geography Club is fast and light, while still showing the struggles and pain of closeted teens.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />I really wanted Russel (MC) to grow a backbone when dealing with various social situations. I realize that high school is tough and you want to avoid conflict when you can, but the way he dealt with some of his \\"friends\\" actions made me a bit sad.<br />There are literally no parents at all in Geography Club. There is some reference to Russel's parents not being a big part of his life, but it was still a little weird.... Dealing with parents and coming out to parents is also a difficult process for a lot of teens, so it would have been nice to see a portrayal of that.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Geography Club manages to be light and fun, while also portraying the isolation and fear that goes along with being a gay teen in an unwelcoming high school. Russel finds that he is not nearly as alone as he thought, both because there are other gay teens at his school and because there are straight teens who care about him, not his sexual orientation. Anyone who is interested in a fast and compelling read about these situations should definitely check out Geography Club before the movie comes out!sexual orientation. Anyone who is interested in a fast and compelling read about these situations should definitely check out Geography Club before the movie comes out!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Overall I thought the game was fun. A little on the short side but still fun. I have enjoyed all the games so far by G5.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just recently purchased this book on my kindle and very excited to get started on this book.  The purchase and download process was very easy and straight forward.  What definitely recommend kindle downloads to anyone.
0446585025|4.0|Fun read! Ellen writes well and is always funny...but there is a definite serious side to her thoughts. Sh'e has a lot to say and is<br />quite inspiring!

B000RLKXEK|5.0|This has been a favorite Pierce Brosnan movie since seeing it years ago - love Amazon Instant Video for downloads to either PC or Kindle to view.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Excellent season. I used a PS3 to stream from Amazon instant video and it was excellent with no problems at all. I would recommend this to anyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the big numbers and ease of use.  It is nice to see what is in the memory and as you change the memory amount, it shows in the total screen.  Nice
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Always enjoy Bruce Willis.  Is there anything he cannot do?  Also, Joseph Gordon-Levitt shows great promise as being another actor who is chameleon-like in his on-screen portrayals.  There was enough publicity beforehand that we were able to follow the plot and make sense of the seemingly senselessness.  Only criticism:  wish there had been subtitles!  Us baby boomers are getting hard of hearing and are still vain enough that we do not want to buy hearing aids!
B001CJJWWA|5.0|Great addition to my DVD collection. Raw talent not often seen. Taken from us way WAY too soon. RIP Amy
0525953728|5.0|This book not only helps to provide closure by giving the graphic details of that marvelous night in May of 2011, but also shows just what the service men and women go through while overseas. Coming from a military family, I was hesitant to read this book because of the controversy of the possible military secrets leaked, but was glad that I did afterwards. There were no true military secrets divulged, only the graphic details of how we finally we able to find and kill the most wanted man in the free world. I was very glad that Owen did not spare any of the details when it came time for the raid.
B00942Y0TM|5.0|This movie is awesome! I bought it on my kindle fire HD and the picture is incredible! I've watched it multiple times already! :)
B008133MDK|4.0|Enjoy this modern take on Holmes and Watson.  Glad that Irene Adler was portrayed as such a capable woman who can give Sherlock a good puzzle.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|I loved the music, the actors, and the story.  I especially liked the greenhouse idea and the lesson that true beauty starts from within.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fast paced, fun, little game! Basic swipe moves, jump, slide, left, right. Enough progressive changes to keep it entertaining. It is hard to stop playing once you start. It is all my five-year-old can do to pry it away from my hands! LOL<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This app Is a fun great mind game with cute characters. Zeptolab has done it again. It's a great time consuming game.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This film was a stunningly vivid portrayal of a young boy's shipwreck and subsequent survival.  It would have been worth a watch just for that.  But the addition of a tiger to Pi's dilemma was a stroke of genius.  It was also heartwarming to see Pi's character evolve to the point that he could be grateful to and pray for the survival of the tiger that threatened his very existence.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The story didn't go hardly anywhere and where it did go left you hanging. Plus I didn't agree with how the characters lives were directed.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This little guy is crazy. He moves along at a nice little clip, quickly moving through a progression of challenges.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love these books. So well written and it just makes you feel like you're there, experiencing the whole thing yourself..
B0095P31L6|3.0|Bit of a nod to old westerns but just an ok movie.  It is quite appealing visually though.<br />A rental at best I think.
B00A8307BG|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Robin, was fortunate enough to see him live in Boston a few years ago, had front row seats (for the first time in my life).  Berkley performace center, best show ever.  And this album is SO darn good, can't get enough of it!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Crazy fun! This little buggy flys through the beach course like a rocket! It is very challenging to try and keep on track to continue in the race! Plenty of obsticles to knock you of course. Just loads of fun!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best book in the series!! It's so action packed and full of twist and turns I couldn't put it down.. It's packed full of emotional highs and lows you can't help but feel feel the reality of what these characters are going through.. I absolutely LOVE this book!!!!
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I have this in blue ray, the story was a good classic version of the original Scrooge.  I bought it for the 3D.  I saw it in 3D before and wanted it for my collection.  I think it's exceptional 3D effects, not over the top, but very pretty and just made the movie better.  I only got the 3D in this one, thus the good price.  As I said before, I already had it in Blue Ray. Arrived as promised, and a great 3D movie to own for my home Cinema.
0761169431|4.0|Origami never seemed so hard. Me, my husband and my stepson (Age:9) struggled with the simple structures. I would say this is for the advanced origami person.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a fun game for everybody. The kids love it, my wife loves it. It is a funny, silly game that is really hard to put down.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B006BG7RI0|5.0|Fantastic DVD...love it.  Ingrid Bergman was such a fantastic actress.  Bogie and Ingrid both had so much screen charisma.<br />This is one of the best movies of all time!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I wanted the Blue Ray version, my Grandson wanted the DVD version.  I got it for the two of us.  I love Disney movies and the digital copy makes watching it anywhere easy.  Just filling my library of movies with my Blue Ray versions, for the picture quality, and for the long term safety of the movie.  Blue rays are hard to damage, great for the longevity and quality of picture.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a blast but you can get so involved playing that you will get yourself wrapped up in it, lose time and suddenly its like you were in a casino and time slipped away.  But lots of fun.  Would be great to shorten a plane ride.
B009EAO38C|5.0|These guys have some amazing talent. Between the mash-ups they do on this album and just the sheer talent they display in their music, I'm definitely a fan.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|Great movie.  This movie is sad, but it definitely one of Pitt better movies.  Not a big Pitt fan, but enjoy his performance in this<br />one, so i bought it.
B005LAII80|3.0|I got this in 3D, but nothing really exceptional.  I did think the scenes with the drug effects were done well.  The story was good, and a good action adventure.  I have just seen better.  The price of the movie was not bad though, and I did enjoy the story and effects of the drug, when things went in slow motion.  A bit bloody for my taste though. So basically it's a good action adventure with drugs and blood, with interesting effects.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Too much trouble trying to get the shapes to form that you want to draw.  Boring and not much fun.
B007IK44CK|5.0|This is a good franchise for Tom Cruise.  He does this character well and chooses good people for the rolls with him.  His choices were spot-on in this one as well.  His female leads and of course Jeremy Renner were excellent.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall is a fantastic singer/pianist.  It's a joy to listen to.  The songs are all just great to listen to.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|Why must I buy a new device in order to play this game? Amazon needs to get their act together and allow people who don't want to put out more money to buy a $.99 game this is rediculous
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another excellent, exciting, read from Vince Flynn.  Couldn't put it down!  Love all of Flynns works but I am in love with Mitch Rapp.
B008VIKLWA|5.0|Great for kids and even adults to watch. The one small thing that bothered me was the whispered the word idiot in a kid's movie?! But other than that it was sweet and the visuals were so stimulating!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Whew!  Had to go check the locks on the doors after this one!  Some parts very hard to get through, but if it's suspense you are looking for, look no further.  You'll be bleary-eyed and tense til you've finished....
B004X4R3FE|5.0|I did not think I would like this movie but I was pleasantly surprised. Good acting, unbiased depiction of actual events, and a human face on people who we think are highly privileged but are also constrained by the duties of their position.
B00992CF6W|5.0|worth every dollar don't waste your money on knock off games get minecraft I would play it all day if I could its so awesome I don't even know how to describe it. it is just that good!!!!!!!!!!

B002GJT4XM|3.0|I ordered this with the 2nd one and instead of getting the dvd version I got the Blue ray version. Yes the blue ray is $20 more but I don't have a blueray player so it's useless to me. Now I don't know if I want to try and order again if I'll just get another blueray.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever watched in 40 years.  Lots of very good actors/actresses but movie did not establish any background, plot, or conclusion.  Made no sense at all.  I wish I could charge the movie producers for the waste of my time watching this mess.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game was a free app of the day. I got hooked right away, great sounds and very challenging. great graphics also.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|I wasn't even tired.  It lacked substance.  It was a good effort, but I felt it was a very thing story line.  It could have been better, in a lot of ways.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Lets you read the bible anywhere, anytime and any place. Great study plans and daily devotionals. Must have for anyone
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Lots of potential but, despite a surprise ending, this movie was between 3 and 4 stars. Good acting but needed a better script.

B00BESM14U|5.0|This was an inspiring and dramatic high school coming of age story.  It's not too typical, but it is a little predictable.
0743297334|4.0|This quick and easy read by Hemingway has every element of a good book; drama, love, violence, and adventure!!! This book is quintessential Hemingway with his distinctive lack of punctuation between character dialogue. This book is short enough to make it a quick and easy read. The story also flows very well so that the reader does not get lost throughout the story.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|this is a great movie for everyone, and if you wanna test video clarity this is a great movie for it.<br />hope this review helps<br />frank
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|The movie's beginning is very exciting and even makes you think twice about flying.  After the &#34;incident&#34; the movie is in the same condition as the plane.  It become long, dragged out and ponderous.  There is absolutely no character development making it difficult to care about any of the characters, most of it doesn't make sense, realistically speaking and the ending is trite. By the end you are exhausted from waiting for it to just &#34;happen&#34; and be over with.  A huge disappointment given all the hype especially about Denzel who was anything but marvelous in this movie.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|The Affair by Lee Child is a #1 New York Times Bestseller. I can see why. I am new to Lee Child suspenseful mysteries. This story for me is number one. It has all the ingredients such as a sleepy town in the Deep South, quite a few murders; a lonely stretch of railroad track, cover-ups, quite a few liars and the list goes on. But having an elite military cop by Jack Reacher on the scene, you know that the bad guys will start blowing smokes and playing the mirrors game. For a new reader to Lee Child stories this one provides more background on who is Jack Reacher is and where did he come from. If you were to pick this book up I can guarantee that you will not put it down from start to finish. Like the famous line in most mystery stories… you got to know who done it! I will not reveal any spoilers but this story has become a real favorite of mine. It has a very well designed plot and the characters talk like real people. You just might say you have met some of these people on your journey called life.  So take it to the next level and start at the beginning “…The Pentagon is the World’s largest office building, six and a half million square feet, thirty thousand people, more than seventeen miles of corridors…” My one question is “Have you ever been there?” I have and I know not everybody can enter.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very suspenseful - lots of twists and turns. A true mystery that kept me guessing all the way. The ending was unexpected but on reflection it fit perfectly.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|If I could rate this game 100 stars I would! It is very fun for all ages and runs super smoothly, gives you EVERYTHING to play no &quot;buying extra features&quot;, overall the best game ever, you can style how you want, you don't need to like hair for this game, you just need to love to have fun!
B000I8ERVC|3.0|I was eager to see the movie again but time has not been kind to it.  Jack Nicholson's performance was still great and a lot of fun to watch but his time is brief in the movie.  The sensibility of the movie is not timely but the style in which it is portraited is dated which makes it just okay.  If it wasn't for Jack the movie would not be a classic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series overall, but some of the story lines bother me. (Thomas/James) I hate that certain characters are now gone. But I will dutifully tune in next year. Unless something more scandalous occurs, I'll probably see it through to the conclusion!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I've heard so much about this movie, until I finally had to see it for myself. It was so good. The performances are brilliantly delivered, the soundtrack is perfect, and the message is timeless. The struggles of the Breakfast Club and the various existential crises (or lack of) applies to every teenager. A must see!
B005V4ZEY2|5.0|I really recommend this product. Once you have installed the free version, activation is very easy. I feel lot more safe with this App in my phone.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the graphics and color on this game. Everything is crystal clear and action packed. I love it a lot.
B004DEW9L2|3.0|Breathless is a brilliant way to be introduced to the French New Wave. However, if you're just looking for a good movie, and you're not much of a film buff, I'd recommend something a little more coherent.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Lost Girl has been compared to Joss Whedon's Buffyverse, and it does have some of the humor that made Buffy such a delight but is closer in tone to the darkness of Angel and goes beyond that in terms of sophisticated characters, plot arcs, universe and politics. Many reviewers are putting the adults only label on the series due to the fact that the protagonist is a succubus and the series does have sexual zing, but I am adding the adult label because there is enough here for the well-versed fantasy reader and viewer to analyze and enjoy.<br /><br />Pilots that introduce a complex universe are notoriously difficult to write, film and act. Lost Girl grabs the viewer in the first thirty seconds and never lets go. It is one of the best pilots I've seen in a long while. Bo is a succubus, but when we meet her, Bo is a bartender rescuing a patron who has been roofied and is on her way to raped, killing the attacker using her succubi powers, which are caught on camera phone by the hapless victim to be, Kenzi. The next morning the two confront each other  and team up against the detectives that are now searching for them both, thanks to the dead body Bo left behind.<br /><br />It turns out, that Bo, adopted as a baby is part of a world known as the Fae, which encompasses every creature of many world mythologies as required for the plot. The interpretations of the legendary and mythical creatures of all cultures is clever and fun. Ensemble characters have well developed personalities and even minor characters stand out. I especially liked the Oracle (\\"Channeling gives me such cotton-mouth!\\")<br /><br />The weekly plot revolves around Bo's refusal to align herself with either the light or dark Fae. Her neutrality makes her valuable in solving problems that handled by another character might dent the fragile peace between the sides and she ends up functioning as a sort of supernatural private detective. Her wolfman lover, Dyson and his sidekick siren are strategically placed on the local police force. This plot set-up should be stale by now, but here feels as fresh as the first time a writer conceived it, which is saying something. Longer arcs focus on the mystery of Bo's birth and parents, partially solved in the first season, the politics of the light and dark Fae and Bo's purpose and relationship to the world of Fae and humans.<br /><br />Is there sex? Sure and as Bo is a succubus, not all of it is heterosexual as her focus is the sexual energy of a person rather than their gender. If you are even a little sensitive to same sex attraction, this show isn't for you, though the lesbian scenes aren't written or played for male titillation. All of the actors and actresses are exceptionally gorgeous, even with their clothes on and the whole thing, plot, character, pretty, short and long story arcs, urban fantasy universe that uses old myths in a new way...all of it makes for some amazing television. Highly recommended to fans of urban fantasy and mythology.the local police force.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I usually do not read books like this. I barely read the blurbs that go with books, so I did not know that I picked up a cancer book till I read it. The twist  of this book is good, the Sharp  conversations  and good writing style make this all work. I just knew it would have an abrupt end. It's all good.  Thank You
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an EPIC game that everyone should have and Love. I especially love the Rome/Easter special. It is awesome and I rate it a 5 star game.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Having grown up in Indiana, I must admit that it was both amazing and nostalgic to read about places I had, up until last year, grown up in and around. The Fault In Our Stars deserves a five star rating because of the timeless thoughts and realities it forces upon us, how life can be cut short and how the families have to deal with it. I laughed, cried, and enjoyed this boom, and although I'm no professional when it comes to reviewing, but I know I will recommend this book to many, many people.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This was a good read.  It helped not only identify what type of love language my spouse and speek, but also helped identify our childrens love language.

B007FH9GA6|1.0|I can't get this video to play.  I went to the site to cancel, but couldn't find any way to do it.  I also looked for some way to let Amazon Prime know of the problem, but again, could find no way to do this.  $10 down the tubes.
0553582038|4.0|So after the tumultuous conclusion of book three I was ready for more craziness but the plot line changes and different characters are brought into the mix in book four. Martin keeps you guessing and turning pages but I have devoured every word and find myself obsessing. Will the dragons return? When will Cersci get her proper due? Will Jamie become a protagonist? Who is a protagonist? Why does Martin kill or injure the characters I'm cheering for? When will the Starks be re-united? Is Katelyn Stark still alive? Does good triumph over evil? The rise of the priests? Book four is a bit tedious after book three. Now I can't wait to read book five. How will it end? Who will sit the Iron Throne? Will the Red Keep remain the seat of power? It has been a fun ride and I have really, really enjoyed the series. I can't recommend it enough. It is engrossing, thought provoking, and thorougly entertaining.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I just finished listening to the deluxe version of this, and I was quite amazed. I wasn't sure what to expect since it has been such a long absence for David Bowie, but he showed here that he's still got it.<br /><br />The album as a whole is a lot more pop than I was expecting. The first 3 or 4 tracks really set the mood for the album, before it slows down for \\"Where Are We Now.\\" After that, it's a mixed bag. By that I mean that there's a lot of stuff on here that's reminiscent of different eras of Bowie's career. \\"Dancing Out in Space\\" reminded me of his 80's style while \\"Heat\\" sounded like it belonged on the Heathen album, just to give a couple of examples. I know that the idea behind this album was to not compare this music to Bowie's past work, but when it feels like such a mixed bag, I couldn't help but do so.<br /><br />There were only a couple of songs I didn't care for on this album after my first listen (not including the deluxe version's bonus songs...of those I only liked \\"I'll Take You There\\"). Those were \\"Boss of Me\\" and \\"How Does the Grass Grow.\\" Neither seemed all that special of songs to me, but perhaps after a few more listens I might grow to appreciate them.<br /><br />The rest of the album is great stuff. My favorites include \\"Where Are We Now,\\" \\"The Next Day,\\" \\"Love is Lost,\\" \\"Valentine's Day,\\" and \\"Heat.\\"<br /><br />As a whole, I wouldn't say this is Bowie's greatest work, but it's definitely a lot better than a lot of other music being put out today. I would give the album 4 stars overall, but 5 stars if you factor in what this album means to Bowie's fans. The lyrics of most of the songs are a lot more light-hearted and literal than a lot of his past work, and obviously Bowie's voice isn't going to improve with age. But these are small negatives to overlook in an album that many of us, myself included, didn't think would ever come out. If you consider yourself a Bowie fan, you owe it to yourself to get this. I'm not sure how much it would appeal to non-Bowie fans, but like all great artists, he has a style all his own.

B000FC12Z0|4.0|The writing was excellent of course as Christie keeps us enthralled with the interview process and suspecting just about everyone. Then we find out -- we're right -- yet still surprised at the end.<br /><br />Best of all -- no one has a cell phone!

B0019N8P2W|5.0|I bought this brand new, and I'm thrilled with my purchase. It's a bit jarring watching the original show without the original music, but it's still pretty good. Yeah, it's a bummer not to hear the music exactly as I remember it, but that doesn't make the purchase a waste of money. I read the reviews before purchase, and I'm satisfied with the money spent. Definitely worth it, as the content of the show is still the same. The only edits are to the soundtrack. Hey, if you want to enjoy the music of the 90's, download the mp3s or buy the songs on CD. I'm just glad to have found the entire set, uncut, for such a great price.
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|This is an outstanding rig for the price you pay. Very good bang for buck. I have a lot of condor gear now and I find them to be outstanding buy for the money. If your a joe or will be using this rig Every Day then get something a little better maybe but to be honest if you dont use every day there is not a better deal out there.
0307383415|5.0|Reading this book at this time in history was fascinating knowing that Barack Obama has gone on to become our President.  At the time of the writing he was the US Senator elect from Illinois.  The straightforward way he relates his life story up to his Harvard days tells the tale of an amazing complex family history which he struggles to find his place within.<br /><br />Even more interesting to me however are his descriptions of the struggles of the races in Africa and the US to work their way through difficult interactions through many many years.  Many times I could hear in my mind Rodney King's call of \\"Can we all just get along?\\".  Obama relates that it certainly isn't as simple as that and there is a long road to travel still.  My eyes were opened much wider to the struggle of people in this country and others than they ever were before.  It is a book that should be read again and again and learned from.<br /><br />I also had a connection to this book because my family and I were lucky to travel to Kenya for a Safari several years ago.  What a glorious trip!  Obama points out in the book that the people of Kenya aren't the ones to benefit from visits such as ours and that should change, but oh am I glad we were there.

B00BOTCJXC|5.0|This HBO miniseries is a masterpiece.  It is beautifully written and acted, and unusually accurate historically.  The film is emotionally devestating on the incompetence of the British military leadership in WWI, and on the hypocracy of social mores in the period before that war.  From excellent novels by Ford Maddox Ford, but even better.  Also, this is Benedict Cumberbatch's best film performance to date.  Buy the video!

B00B04NJI0|4.0|\\"The ABCs of Death\\" is a horror anthology film where 26 different directors were given one letter, asked to choose one word, and then were given creative and artistic freedom to come up with their segment of the film. Directors include Jason Eisener (\\"Hobo with a Shotgun\\"), Xavier Gens (\\"The Divide\\"), Noboru Iguchi (\\"Machine Girl\\"), Yoshihiro Nishimura (\\"Suicide Club\\"), Banjong Pisanthanakun (\\"Shutter\\"), Simon Rumley (\\"Red White & Blue\\"), Srdjan Spasojevic (\\"A Serbian Film\\"), Nacho Vigalondo (\\"Timecrimes\\"), Ti West (\\"The House of the Devil\\"), Ben Wheatley (\\"Kill List\\"), and Yudai Yamaguchi (writer of \\"Versus\\") among many others. The anthology undeniably sets the bar awfully high for the most insane cinematic effort for a given year.<br /><br />After the excellent efforts from fellow anthology films \\"The Theatre Bizarre\\" and \\"V/H/S,\\" it's as if the format of a horror film comprised of several different short films has made a resurgence over the past couple of years. \\"The ABCs of Death\\" capitalizes on that aspect and is perhaps the most ambitious version of the format yet; 26 stories with nothing in common other than horrific death. Strap yourselves in, horror fans. This is like immediately jumping to the climax without any foreplay.<br /><br />With the massive amount of segments in the film, you can imagine that the quality can fluctuate quite a bit from beginning to end. The film can't be judged on just a good or bad scale as some segments are extremely peculiar (H), grotesque (I), and flat out ridiculous (F). Several other segments put more weight into the comedy department. J deals with an executioner seeing a man make funny faces as he commits harakiri, K probably has the most absurd interaction between a woman and the business she does in the restroom, and N shows why giving your girlfriend a parrot may not be the best idea.<br /><br />Z is literally so ludicrous that you can't help but laugh. With its giant penises and vegetables being shot out of vaginas while this character in a wheelchair is like this odd homage to \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" Z is able to combine just a little bit of everything to end up being so fantastically memorable. S is one of the most well rounded segments since it actually seems to tell a complete story or at least as much of one as can be told in that limited amount of time.<br /><br />Personal favorites include the disgustingly brilliant L, the uniquely disturbing R, the entertaining claymation of T, the incredible perspective of U, the futuristic V, the powerful X, and Jason Eisener's Y that's set to some awesome 80s throwback music.<br /><br />Featuring the likes of women attracted to farts, samurais, talking birds, drug addicts, monster toilets, vampires, robots, pedophiles, chainsaw sex, and naked men making sushi at gunpoint, \\"The ABCs of Death\\" pretty much has every base covered. \\"The ABCs of Death\\" is a repulsive and excessive excuse of blood-soaked entertainment that should make the horror fan in you squeal with delight.this character in a wheelchair is like this odd homage to \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" Z is able to combine just a little bit of everything to end up being so fantastically memorable.

B00B2DSIAI|5.0|For our kids, this was just a special movie. We felt compelled bringing them to the theatre more than once to watch it and now that we have purchased it, it is something they would watch everyday if we allowed it... Oh and it is good for the grown ups also. :-)
B009DP9D6A|5.0|This is the first deadmau5 album I've bought and it definitely won't be the last. I like just about every song on this album.
B0001DMPVI|4.0|I'd purchased a couple of Animals CD's before and was disappointed.  The early Animals relied too much on standard blues-ism, even though I loved their hits from that era, and the latter Eric Burdon & the Animals attempted too much psychedelia that came off lame (aka pseudo-psychedelia).  Did they really try to pass off Monterrey and Winds of Change as psychedelia?  I think so.<br />The Twain Shall Meet is way more of a real psychedelic album, although Monterrey is the lead-off track.  Monterrey wasn't that bad of a song; it just wasn't psychedelic and it was one of a number of Burdon tunes where he just kind of provides a litany of performers that he likes (I guess).  At least this was a pretty focused psychedelic disc with a number of cool tunes including Sky Pilot and Just the Thought.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game for the cool people and people that like  to play fun games  for a lot of people so have fun
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|The saw this in the theatre and after leaving continually asked about when they could go see it again. Now that we have it at home, it has been a staple of our viewing.
B00511PTWM|1.0|Plug in part will not stay connected. Slightest vibration loses connection. The adjustment ring in back does not stay in place it keeps slipping so you lose your fitted adjustment and it falls out of socket. Front part is good and items plug into it fine. I would remove from inventory.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|This is, of course, is a thinly veiled account of the early days of Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard, This is a superb telling of that story.<br /><br />Like many bringers of ideas before him, L. Ron Hubbard has either been sainted or demonized. He was a great adventurer, and whether we like it our not, he created a unique recombination of existing information and his own personal observations called Scientology that will continue to impact human kind for generations.<br /><br />This story beautifully presents the man as a human being. It occasionally interjects the weaknesses he was known for - never forgetting the compassion he held for trapped souls.<br /><br />Every part in this film was perfectly casted and executed by the actors.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film for anybody with an interest in human beings. The ending created an image that will guide the rest of my life here on Earth!

0385474547|5.0|I have just read Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe for my 10th grade class. I thought that I might not like it but the exact opposite was true, I very much liked the book(to the surprise of the rest of my class who hated it). The author paints a very clear picture the the clan and tribal life and how Europeans come and, well make things fall apart. I think that if you are studying European imperialism than this is a great book because you get to see the point of view from the people being taken over.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|I thought it was impossible for these folks to exceed themselves. I was incorrect.<br /><br />The extra-ordinary composite of characters, set, music and super human athleticism was woven into a tale of intrigue, mystic and great beauty. I was translated into their world and didn't even miss my own couch for a minute.<br /><br />Go into this world, feel, play and immerse yourself in the highest form of human creativity out there.
B005ZUR724|4.0|so this is a pretty awesome game. there are a few glitches. just updated so not sure if any of them were fixed yet. most annoying one is the chat fail. basically kicks you off if you speak too much. the game kept bugging me to review it which is why i am here writing this. it is fun and i would recommend it to friends. it's great to play with friends and people you meet in game. my favorite part is listening/reading my guild conversations. they are really crazy and entertaining. although the creators seem to favor the Apple players over the android users. not cool. love the \\"New\\" race. they are adorable. :) warning this game will try to get you to spend real money for things. ex. runes for more character slots. I fell for that one. spending money in game is not needed but can make things easier.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|fun way to spend some time and cheap cost worth the price simple and easy to learn. would reccomend to friends
0062014536|5.0|I rarely take the time to write reviews but I thought this book was getting the shaft!  Everyone went on and on about a bad ending...not so in my opinion!  The ending was a million times better than the third book from The Hunger Games...people loved that series and it ended with all the characters depressed, crazy or dead...Requiem had a positive ending, there was promise and hope and we find out who Lena is truly meant to be with.  Yes, there is no perfect world in the end but I think that would be unrealistic to expect.  Who knows, perhaps there will be a fourth book to quench readers' thirst for more Delirium...at least there's an option to do so.  I've read a lot of dystopian books and I think the Delirium series was one of the more enjoyable reads.

B0052GACNM|5.0|It's really amazing that a guy in his mid 80's can sound this good vocally.  And most of these duets work well with some of the other fine singers on this CD.  However I could easily have done without Ms. Carey.  Lady Gaga was a very pleasant surprise - she should do more like this.  Buble, lang, Aretha, Willie, Queen, Norah, Natalie, Andrea, Faith and Carrie.  All good. I hope he's back at 90 and still belting them out with that great voice

B009IEXKXI|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. The hero I found to be easy to like, the way he solved problems, the ideas he came up with to survive I found to be realalistic. I have a great interest in Mars, so, if and when we get there, this is how we may live on the plant.

B007QDNKQA|5.0|Film about a sniper in the special forces who is an exceptional sharp shooter.  If you like combat/action movies, you will like this movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Pretty good. Quick easy read. Could use a map to make the districts stand out more. I liked it though
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|ok for the people who dont like this album just because its not what bon jovi used to be, GET OVER IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! music alone is not what it used to be! ive never been a big fan of jovi's  but i can say that this album is not bad at all. as far as music in late 2012 goes, this album should be kicking the crap out of that of what people call music now days. the first song on the album is incredible and the title song is pretty good as well. this should be getting air time on the radio if it isnt already and it may be in some areas. i will say that this album is a little heavy but its not even as heavy as some of the so called country music these days<br /><br />overall... i dont yet know if this is an album worth actually buying or just downloading a few of the songs from it, but i like it and i wish it would stick around but i know it wont just like his album from 2002.
B008OP32M6|5.0|This LEGO set is probably one of the best ones of all times. I love my Lego Crawler and suggest it for anyone. I have upgraded my truck to make every thing perfect in order to give it more performance. Building the truck and modifying it is really exciting and the truck easily lets you upgrade different gears, suspension, and even tires and motors. But overall it is a good little rig. you're practically building a slower version of an RC crawler. the only things that I didnt like after awhile were the power, torque and slowness of the rig. But after modding the vehicle with posse in front and rear(straight-axling) adding different gears for more torque and customizing a million things with the chassis and body, along with putting 1.9 Mudslinger tires on the stock wheels (tires can be found at RC4WD.com) the truck runs awesomely.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Sadly it has locked up twice on my kindle and required reload. All progress was lost. I have not given up and I'm still playing.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This book is very enlightening and helpful I feel more confident that I came up with my own questions to start a conversation with meeting new people. This book is worth reading more than once.
B0000026CM|3.0|i really will never understand why the critics are the way they are dismissing some of the biggest tallent that the world could have seen, toto is one of them, there are a few boring songs on here but for the most part the songs that are good are really good. i have come accross some of these songs on youtube before and never reaized they were from the same album. HOME OF THE BRAVE is an incredible song, its a little long though. STOP LOVING YOU is probably the greatest thing to come from any rock group ever. this album should have been bigger, they had the talent, they had the sound, they had the look, what didnt they have to make it big?<br /><br />overall... i love toto as a whole, i feel that if they could make another great hits album some of these songs should be on that along with some of their other work as well.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|this game was very easy to learn to play.  It is also fun and addicting. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I enjoyed this so much!  It was really interesting with every episode a cliff hanger!  Truly enjoyable.  Couldn't get enough!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved it. Although, it did remind me about Twilight: New Moon. I love, yet it still ticks me off, how they leave us at a cliff hanger that makes us want to pick up the next book.
B0011Z31V8|5.0|He'sa  timeless talent. I love this cd as much today as when it first came out many years ago. I would suggest it to any Prince fan.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is a charming book that gives history, a slice of life, and is truly fun to read. I recommend it to all.
B003L77GH4|5.0|What can i say - I LOVE this series.  I don't usually go in for this sort of thing, but this series was so well done it is  positively compelling.  Not bloody or macabre.  It's a love story - and a very passionate one at that, with none of the smut you see nowadays.  Great book!
B008YKGQR4|4.0|glad the app exists much quicker to connect<br />still have issues with some games loading and wrking through fb though
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book and the series!!! I have read them 4 times already!!! They are my go to books when I want to read!!!
B007PAANYG|5.0|excelente album llego en tiempo no hubo necesidad de reportarlo, con un buen embalaje, todo llego muy bien una exceletne compra que definitivamente recomiendo
B000008M1P|5.0|Just now buying this as a CD.  I still have the cassette tape from 1988.  Makes me wish the original line up could have continued making music.  Hopefully the VXN reunion tour this year will result in new music.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|The Smith's Pocket Pal Sharpener works well to sharpen knives of all types. I have been able to sharpen all of my pocket knives with this sharpener. I had a blade with some nicks in it. The carbide blade resurfaced the nicks and, I was able to sharpen the blade.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IT'S FUN IT'S WICKED INSPESHILY FOR FREE DOWNLOAD AND I LIKE THE IDEA OF<br />THE SKATE BOARD AND THE IDEA OF THE GOLDEN MONEY IT GETS ME LOTS OV MONEY<br /><br />I WANT YOU DAD TO COMMENT PLEASE
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|excelente album llego en tiempo no hubo necesidad de reportarlo, con un buen embalaje, todo llego muy bien una exceletne compra que definitivamente recomiendo
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I rarely like music the first time I listen to it, but this CD is definitely one of those exceptions.  It reminds me of Lost Highway, in that it has kind of a country sound.<br /><br />This is a reason why their new CDs go gold right after they're released - this band never disappoints & is why I buy their new CDs even before I hear any of the songs.  Bon Jovi fans old & new will love this CD.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Great flick!  John C. Riley is a pimp.  Who knew I could become diabetic from a movie and be happy about it.
B008NW67E0|2.0|The sound has been done before and better. Most of the songs are rather boring and empty. The album as a whole does not strike me as authentic.
B003H8WSM0|5.0|excelente album llego en tiempo no hubo necesidad de reportarlo, con un buen embalaje, todo llego muy bien una exceletne compra que definitivamente recomiendo
B0000075WM|5.0|I bought this on cassette 22 yrs ago & I still love the music.  I wish the original line up had stayed together - they definitely made great music together.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Almost scary to read as our own country seems to be going crazy .  Over all a great book to read
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I loved the effects and acting , they were fantastic. I was a little fuzzy about the interview with the engineer .
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I loved this movie, and I can't wait for the others to come out. He did a great job, and the CGI was awesome.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read NDE books for over 30 years because I am fascinated by the experiences and choose to believe them. Dr. Eben Alexander offers something none of the other books could...serious, authentic science combined with his insightful, profound experience. I respect Dr. Alexander for telling his story at the risk of his reputation in a high profile profession. It had to be told and he told it extremely well. I have shared, Proof of Heaven, with my neighbor who is a Neurologist. I know she will find it equally fascinating. It is an excellent book.
B003297I1U|5.0|Son (4 years) can't stop playing with it!!!  Worth every penny!!!<br />Looking for more Bruder trucks and other items to complete a construction site!!!
B004XWLIJS|5.0|I like Jason Statham and he was great in the Mechanic. I really loved the change in the ending  from the original .
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Such a create season and series!!!! Can't wait to watch season 3....So happy about Mr Bates!!!! Wonder if Mary will marry
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I read this book in about 24 hrs. It's a beautiful love story that I felt I haven't read before. The only note to the author I would make is that I personally don't like when the stars of the book are in high school. I have a hard time believing that teenagers can feel or talk this way. Other than that though, I would recommend this book.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It's based on a true event. We all know the outcome. So it's a sign of a well-made film when I find myself wondering if they'll escape. Excellent performances all around.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Great characters, descriptions and character development kept me totally engrossed.<br />Have recommended it to several of my friends.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It is exactly what I wanted in perfect shape.  It includes all of the Star Wars movies to date.  It was awesome getting to watch them all in order of how the story goes rather than the order they came out.  I highly recommend buying this set.
030758836X|3.0|This book was incredible with so many different twists, I was always coming back for more. It's one of those books that you think about when you aren't reading and anxiously await some time to jump back in. The book's main twist midway through was odd and changed my direction, but it sparked my curiosity even more. However, the ending was disappointing. On page 400, I was thinking, \\"there are only 15 pages left, there must be something huge that's going to happen!\\" especially given all the twists that have already occurred.  Sadly no, it fizzled to a pathetic ending. I'm not necessarily looking for a happy ending, but something a little more climatic was deserved from a book that spent 414 pages swelling with anticipation. Definitely read it!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We love the series.  Ordered season one and two and received them quickly.  Wouldn't hesitate to go thru process again.
B0037EPYLG|5.0|This is the best of Eric Clapton. He is a true proffesional, a time tested musician for rock and roll
B004VMUS9G|5.0|SOMETIMES I THINK ABOUT AMERICA ABOUT HER STRUGGLES THOUGH THE YEARS I WONDER IF THEY KNEW THAT WHAT THEY HAD TO DO IN A LAND WHERE FREEDOM WILL LAST
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|The physics are accurate too. goes faster as it gets smaller and slower as it gets bigger. It's kind of sereen and relaxing too.
B008HJGPVO|2.0|Intermittent action on Samsung Galaxy S2. Priced too high for what it is. Would not recommend. Maybe it is ONLY for Kindle?
1616550414|5.0|Worth it for any Zelda fan or videogames enthusiast. Is a piece of history to one of the most legendary sagas ever created.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|The War of Art is an inspiring book that confronts what it takes to conquer the enemy within.  Pressfield crystallizes the everyday resistance that acts to derail progress and offers tools to defeat it.  This book not only aids the artist, but the rest of us too.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Feel like your in live in the audience.  pleasure to watch again and again.  Very good Audio and video quality.
B007N0REX6|3.0|Got it for my son who is heavily into music, especially the guitar. The guitar bits by Slash are really good. Wish the vocals were done by someone else. We both did not like the vocals much.
B006MW3UZW|2.0|I don't have ability to stream to another device, therefore it only comes in standard definition.  My laptop is 1440x990.  I would appreciate 720p at least.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the most creative and thought provoking series in a long time. We can't wait for Sunday night and the next episode.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|You just have to love this movie. It never gets old no matter how many times I watch it. Great Movie
B000NMW6M0|4.0|It was a little long and some scenes didn't need to be so long (ie someone walking down the street) but overall was worth watching. I would watch it again. I loved the vastly different stories within the same movie. Plan for the 2 1/2 hrs and you'll enjoy it.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This the best account I have read about the hardships of being a &#34; Mud Marine&#34;. The pain of the living conditions no one ever gets use to, but the terror of battle does become manageable. There is no glory or boastfulness in this account just the down and dirty account of a Marine grunt.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Got it for a Christmas gift for the hubby and he loved it!! Great Movie I'd deff reccomend it! :)
0312427999|5.0|A classic from 2007, more relevant today!  Naomi Klein traces the use of financial shock to enable the political takeover by &#34;Neo-Liberal&#34; free-market orthodoxy in our time of Monopoly Capitalism, from Chile in 1973 to Iraq still today.  This is an extra copy to pass around to interested readers.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|my son enjoys this game.very much there are aime.problems it reset at level 21 if that is considered the end its fine though the other problem is that it takes soo. long to download overall a very good addictive game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I couldn't stop. I wanted to know what happened next, I only wish there was more.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Got it for a Christmas gift for the hubby and he loved it!! Great Movie I'd deff reccomend it! :)
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The step by step instructions could not have been clearer. New authors take note.<br />A must for anyone trying to break into the world of writing for Kindle.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Love the chemistry between the characters.  Good ensemble cast. Total fiction, but great escapist fun!<br />Can't wait to catch up on season five episodes.
0374533571|5.0|Despite the fact this novel is not as masterfully crafted as others, I had a hard time putting it down. The style is direct, succinct, and yet personal. The male protagonist, Pat, is adorable, full with contradiction, compassionate, simple and, simultaneously, complicated. He has no clue why the world is against him and still believes in silver linings. Tiffany, Pat's counterpart, is awkward, eccentric, loud, and yet fragile. Together they paint the most unbelievable vista of a love story. There were a few times I felt hard to swallow because of the heavy sensation in my throat. I wanted to cheer for Pat, and secretly hoped what he would reunite with his (ex)lover.
B001P75M0K|5.0|This is my first album from Booker T, man I just love the sound, Green Onions is awesome!  I gotta buy more soon.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day writes with riveting and sexual style. Couldn't put this book down.....finished in one weekend. A must to read if you enjoy sex, humor and adventure!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was so hard to put down and now I'm sad it's over. If you haven't read it, then hurry up and you will love all of them.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|its good it is good it is really good I like it a whole lot I like it a really whole lot it is great I love it a whole lot
B003MC5N28|5.0|This was a book club choice. It was really worth the read! I guess this is one of those book you read in school. Not sure how I missed it, but so glad I've read it now!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Funny and moving movie for anyone to enjoy! Loved the dancing and singing amongst teenagers. Rate it B. Check it out!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Lots of fun for kids and adults, running your own dinosaur park gotta love it.<br />I wish I had more dollar's in the game, lots of fun all the same.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|And it just keeps getting better and better. We're completely hooked and can't wait to see Season 3. The plots, costumes, cast, scenery are all absolutely perfect.
B0060CXBGM|5.0|just a funy family movie that family willenjoy.great acting and highly recommend you must see .plus its a true story.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I can download Library books to read at my convenience and I do not need a Wi-Fi connection after the book has been downloaded.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I manage my bipolar disorder with my psychiatrist, visits every 3 months.  Was diagnosed in 1994 by self-initiated hospitalization. I have experienced a huge spectrum of emotions and believe this account to be spot on. Only difference really, I have no interest in pro football...only college :-)  Bipolars really willing to manage their own illness should see this, and no pill-skipping!
B001RJTFP4|2.0|When I ordered the Blu-Ray version of this movie, I was informed that I was also to receive this digital version to use through the cloud player. I was not told, however, that it was only available for a limited time. If they are going to provide a digital copy for online viewing, they should make it permanent or not at all.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|I haven't done too much with this but it seems like it's a good start for processing pictures. I give it three stars because I haven't had much of a chance to use it. I'll revisit this review once I have.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle for android rocks on my Coby 10&#34; android tablet. The type is easy on the eyes and the systems syncs to my computer & Kindle without trouble.
B0049KWAVY|5.0|For my mother actually, She says it's great. Carpenters are true class, not doubt.  I was so shocked and saddened by Karen's untimely death.
B001N3GUIE|2.0|When I ordered the Blu-Ray version of this movie, I was informed that I was also to receive this digital version to use through the cloud player. I was not told, however, that it was only available for a limited time. If they are going to provide a digital copy for online viewing, they should make it permanent or not at all.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I'm not much for jigsaw puzzles so I thought I'd get this  for my Mother when she visits, I've been using it and I like it.  Good for the brain!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a cute light love story.  Well-written.  Smooth reading . Had trouble putting the  book aside.  Had to read to find out what was next.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Only one slow part. However, you could not help but feel Grisham  was posturing a  dramatic exposure.. He was and net, net, net I looked forward to my sessions with THE RACKETEER...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is teaching me to care for a horse it rocks like its hard to explain how awesome it is
B000OVLINI|5.0|I loved this book because of the rich characters and the writing.  Considering this was translated from Spanish, it could have been stilted but it was beautiful.  I wish I could read it in Spanish.  I loved the setting of Barcelona and the history and I loved the parallel between the main characters.  The reason I read it twice was first because it was a pretty complicated plot and when I got to the end, I realized that some things were confusing to me (probably my attention span). But second,  I would never have bothered to reread it except that I loved the writing so much and the story, that I really wanted to understand how and why everything transpired the way it did.  I highly recommend this book and if you read it slowly and carefully, you'll get it the first time!
B007REV4T8|5.0|No one can to Sean Connery in the James Bond role.  However, Craig comes very close.  Skyfall is a great film with a great story line.  Bringing back the Aston Martin was a nice touch.
B000002KHF|4.0|A Christmas gift for a Van Morrison lover.  Very good CD; I listen to it when I visit and may have to get my own!
0805079831|2.0|I would have preferred to have given this 2-1/2 stars. I don't like it, but admit that it is an important book. Fortunately for Klein, she has just enough self-awareness (and has done enough research) to avoid this work being just another conspiracy-theory. Yet she overstates her case. The link between Friedman's work in Chile and what transpired in Iraq is tenuous at best, with little accounting for the stupidity of the Bush Administration. Furthermore, when she gets on a roll she has a bad habit of resorting to anachronisms. There are some real clangers here. And I still cannot tell if she uses the example of shock therapy as a metaphor for what comes next, or if she really believes that this is part of a larger whole. At the same time, I would have to say that this book could provide a valuable outline for someone who is willing to do further research in less politically motivated sources.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Enjoying second book. Getting to know a little more about the characters. Can't wait to finish and read third book!!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|What a joy to have a tool that is easy to use for cleaning up history, caches, etc. Excellent download.
0446585041|5.0|I love watching Ellen on her show but reading her book \\"Seriously...I'm Kidding\\" was still so surprising.<br /><br />I was very impressed with how quickly she was able to make me laugh with her written words. I do not believe that it is an easy task to do without a voice and movements.<br /><br />I read this book last year on a 15 hour plane ride, and it kept me awake and entertained a good portion of the flight.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone out there that is a fan of Ellen, her show, or just anyone wanting to laugh in general.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game for traveling, break time at work, down time at home, and just to step out of reality once in a while!! I play this all the time and can't wait for new games to be added!
B008G3N71W|5.0|Wonderful and imaginative romp into the alternative lifestyle of debauchery. This author goes to the top of the class for how she reeled me into the sexual journey of a young women bent on becoming an actress by thwarting obstacles along the way. The characters jump from the pages with descriptive realism and crisp dark connotations. I loved how Greta evolved and spurned social stigma by rocking her own world.This exercise garnered the respect of all she touched as her increments of training proved a painful lesson in submission. Rising as a Phoenix from the ashes of her past life she embarks into her future to fulfill her dreams. I hope there's more books to follow I became attached to a lot of these characters and would love to know how they all evolve and of course Richard the stud muffin has to come back for seconds........
B00ATSBIIG|3.0|The graphics are beautiful and the puzzles are beautiful too.  I guess I'm just old fashioned and prefer the jigsaw puzzles in a box to the this one which is on my Kindle.  It does work great with Kindle, it just isn't my thing.
0446547573|5.0|I am a huge Nicolas Sparks fan, and have read many of his books. For most, I finish the book in tears, but that was not the case with Safe Haven. This is a great story filled with suspense, family, love, and surprises.<br /><br />I read the book when I found out a movie was being made, and I am glad I did read the book first. This is a fast read and the chapter to chapter viewpoint change really keeps the reader engaged.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any Nicolas Sparks fan. Or anyone wanting to read a cute love story that has it all. Without the standard Nicolas Sparks sad ending.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I never expected to love this movie; but I found myself getting into the storyline just as much as my kids. Truly a great movie that can be enjoyed with any member of the family. I look forward to adding it to the family collection.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|What a great group of actors and stories.  These were fun and adventurous shows that were stopped way before they should been.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|I was really disappointed.  I would prefer that he sings more classical music as when he first started recording.  He seems to be getting away from this type of music.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run is the best games i have played in my life. I like how it take you running different places like first your running then your in a little box ride through a little trian track!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed Downton Abbey. Had to buy the 2nd & 3rd seasons on dvd after seeing the 1st on Netflix.  Couldn't wait!  Highly recommend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season keeps the intensity and the action going. I think a couple of the characters seem to be getting lost in the mix, but overall it's still hands down the most thrilling show on.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This was such a good sequel! Kept me on the edge of my seat constantly wanting to read more and more. Definitely reading the third book ASAP!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is the only game I play out of the  many games I have. I LOVE this app.I would recommend this for anyone!!!
B005QUQ99K|5.0|Legos as expected--lots of entertainment for kids and dads alike.  Working on our Ninjago collection with hopes of technic sets next.
B0002HZHXG|5.0|My son loved the addition of sound to his truck.  It was very easy to install, although I could have used better instructions on popping out the lights to switch the color. I kept trying to twist it off and pulling, but you kind of have to just snap it off.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book is amazing, I found it after reading the whole hunger game book series, it was such a amazing book it's detailed and you feel like your actually there !
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book I amazing,it taught me about loving one another and being able to stay with one another through the rough times I do recommend this book to other people!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like the game a lot but it was way too short!  Needs more levels.  I just brought it and I finished it already. Please add more!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Beginning to end.<br /><br />I really love everything about it. The characters, the plot, the set, the visuals, you name it. This movie is Oscar worthy for its visuals.<br /><br />I love how they include elements from the original movie and clean Oz up to make it look more modern. The characters are great, especially Finley the monkey and the china doll.<br /><br />There are a few jump scenes and some scary scenes in this movie. I recommend it for ages six up.<br /><br />Overall, Oz: The Great and Powerful is a journey to Oz well worth taking, especially in 3D.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this movie.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The book tells a gentle story about a simple shepherd that is enlightening without preaching. It is an engaging, relaxing and delightful read.
0312983867|4.0|Just when you thought Stephanie Plum's life couldn't get any crazier, she's now being chased by men in bear and bunny costumes, along with men masked as Clinton and Nixon. They're employed by a seriously crazy man named Abruzzi, who believes that Stephanie has waged war against him and is withholding information about Evelyn, a woman who has disappeared with her children and who has something Abruzzi wants. Along with the usual car blow-ups and break-ins to Stephanie's apartment 'sending her a message from Abruzzi', Hard Eight further explores the growing sexual tension between bounty hunter extraordinaire, Ranger and Stephanie. I really enjoyed this book from the series and the fact that there was some very unexpected twists and turns along the way.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|It has beautiful  settings and costumes. The characters match what I know of that period of history.  The dialog is filled with things that make me laugh, but are easily missed.
1609613937|5.0|This book addresses many of the nagging questions I have had regarding prevailing diet wisdom. Easy to understand and exceptionally well sourced. Absolutely makes sense! Recipes are easy and delicious. Love love love the potato enchiladas!
B00125WAWS|5.0|Ran across this the other day at the local library - what a little jewel of a movie, with a great musical score!<br />Hopefully everyone has been fortunate enough to have a teacher (or two) similar to the main character which Denzel so aptly portrays - I know I have.<br /><br />Normally I'm a plot driven (instead of character development) type of fan, but I do enjoy character development in movies IF they're based on true events / characters. I also enjoy  it when movies tell what happened to the main characters later in their lives (after the movie ends).<br />This movie is good on so many levels - numerous stories within stories as well as a history lesson.<br />Other than the occasional curse word (if that bothers you AFA kids watching), this is a great movie for the family.<br /><br />After returning it to the library, I ordered a copy to add to my personal movie collection.<br />This is one I'll enjoy pulling off the shelf over a period to years to enjoy many times over.<br />I also ordered the film score (not the soundtrack) - the music from the final scene through the ending credits is a fantastic piece of work!<br /><br />The extras also add to the story - interviews with the actual characters, and informing that before television, debates were big events (much as sporting events these days).<br />Debates were a major form of entertainment back then, with folks often paying admission to watch.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|I happened to have read the book some years ago and the story stuck with me. Seeing it come to life in this beautifully filmed production was a thrill. I never watch a movie twice, but I just might watch it again.
1936608898|5.0|Explains everything in a way that anyone couldunderstand.  Makes a complex topic simple. I am not a reader, but this book held my attention and provided the information I needed to make an educated decision.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Good clean app. Good presentation. Comes up fast and clean with all the information you want on one simple page.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Not the best James Bond film. A lot of action but a lot of unanswered action too? I've seen better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|seems very real life and is very soothing to play as well as fun your horse actually looks forward to seeing you and comes right to you
015603252X|5.0|Reading this book was a challenge but a challenger that I thoroughly  enjoyed.  The authors wealth of knowledge is mind boggling and I feel I learned a .lot more about Israel and its history than I knew before.  The depth of the characters is amazing.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This has been my primary keyboard since I downloaded it. They update it often and keep making it better. Worth the cost for sure.
1451695195|5.0|Very well writtan and coming from a doctor it really meant more and was more understandable. Have passed it on to friends.
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|This EP stomps ass start to finish.I heard the cover of Badlands \\"HIGH WIRE\\",Baby yesterday morning & was highly impressed,enough so that although I had ignored Adrenaline Mob's debut ,I headed up to best buy & picked up both of them. Still haven't opened the first one up but this 8 track covers set is so good that I've already listened to it twice through & recommend it just for the Badlands cover alone. The other seven tracks are all badass,fast & heavy. Excellent musicianship all around with the vocals being the selling point here for me  so pick this one up is what I'm telling you. And KranK it!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved the return visit to Middle Earth in the Hobbit An unexpected Journey. I will go ahead and buy a 2 disc DVD and a Blu ray extended version at Christmas. I just can't wait.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very scary! Made me a believer. We went wheat free on Monday. Got no sleep after day 1. Had flu like symptoms on day 2 and Had dreams about cake. Was extremely cranky on day 3 but by day 4 I was back to normal. Best of all, my knees were hurting so bad I was having a problem climbing stairs (I'm only 50 and play tennis several times a week). By Thursday my knee pain was good. Amazing! I can't wait to see what it does for weight lose and cholesterol.
B006LSZECO|5.0|OMG! This book is \\"amazing\\", pun intended. Lot's of twists and turns. Psycho bitch is right on the money,BUT who among us hasn't pretended? We all have and we always will.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Keep making the show - I'll keep buying new seasons. Its all good, but probably wouldn't sell if the show was called Breaking Good.
B006QPX7UI|5.0|I didn't think I'd be able to see this again when my old VHS tapes degraded to the point I could no longer watch them (I viewed this movie quite a bit notwithstanding its length.  Thanks to Amazon's live stream, I could enjoy it on demand - if you would like an entertaining presentation of this engagement of the Civil War, I believe you'll enjoy it.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|It's Maiden...how could it be anything but perfect. I don't even have it yet because amazon asked me to review it based on having preordered it. I have the old version on vhs so I'm guessing this to be a higher quality version of the same awesome show.
B0063GORYU|3.0|starting to not like this app. The new adds and their content irritate me.  The game is fun the adds are too much.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is tons of fun.  all of y'all that bought this game and say it screwed up your kindle...two words...User error!  Maybe the people that had issues with the game should not use technology because you r just flat out STUPID
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is great I can pick the music that I make up to and its very easy and quick to set up a alarm
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This was purchased as a gift. I have seen the three movies and they are awesome! A nust for Batman fans.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|the game is pretty good for casual gamers some levels are challenging and sometimes gives you no time to think. I think this game is also for people who are looking for a challenge.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A great read! It's a fun game. I love playing hidden object games! They pass the time in a great way! I would love to see more games of this genre.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Not bad story line and concept but, no comparison to the original Alien. Price was right, .99 cents, so no complaints.
B009AP4MGE|5.0|I really enjoyed being able to catch up on a great show!  Thanks so much for offering this type of product.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|I refuse to download or play any game that promotes Darwinianism. Don't try forcing belief in heresy on us via a &quot;fun game&quot;!
B005HSL626|4.0|I have played this acouple times, just cant get into it much but my grandson an daughter love playing it...
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I saw this with my daughter at the movies and at the end of the movie I believe he put a pig's tail on the evil mayor.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Pretty nice game, and the shuffle feature is very helpful. Nice colors and lots of configurations. Fun for the whole family!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Didn't get any new input.  Little boring, although was happy with the ending.  I think the 1st part was the best.
031617615X|2.0|In my view the Twilight Series is like junk food: tastey and amusing, but not that good.  That said I have read the whole series.  While I rather liked the first three books, this one was much less interesting.  I felt like its execution was rather rushed, the author covers a lot of ground in terms of plot events, but doesn't really develop a lot of them, and then seems to throw in sort of random events and details that don't really contribute to the forward motion of the story.  Some of the dialogue was so cheesy I actually imagined a sit-com laugh track in the background which was so apropos I couldn't dispel it.<br /><br />The book is divided into three distinct segments, with Bella narrating the first and last, and Jacob narrating the middle section.  While I liked the idea of switching to a different perspective while Bella is home bound and can't do much, I thought the way Jacob's voice was written was rather heavy-handed in terms of using different vernacular to distinguish him from Bella, making him rather crude and unrefined.  It made me like his character less, and he had been a favorite before.<br /><br />I think most of what kept me reading this series was the sexual tension, which appeals to the silly teenage girl aspect of me.  With the wedding and the horrendous pregnancy, the love triangle became more painful than sexy-angst inducing, and it really took the wind out of the sails for me.  She does supplement that with tension from various other life/death plot developments, but that's not why I tuned in to begin with.<br /><br />Ultimately, it does still deliver in terms of fast read and entertainment, but far less fun than the first three books.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Good time music performed by a fun band that gets you involved in their choruses and the beat of their songs.  A great effort for a new band and a first-time album.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I was enthralled from the very beginning and it kept my interest until the very end. It is part love story, part mystery as all the pieces come together. Would highly recommend.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I only got 3 hours of sleep and I don't regret it at all.  This second book lived up to my expectations and was again entrapping.  So much is revealed that you get the satisfaction of some closure on things but now you are left with what is next.  I really can't wait for Entwined with You!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is by far my favorite adventure game.  The length is about right although I wouldn't complain if it was longer.  The story line is pretty good.  Graphics are good.  I just wish it would be in Chinese also since my mother can not read English.  She would love this game.  I hope future games would be as fun as this one.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This was one of his best ever great acting,he kept you involved and thinking. I hope he wins an award with this one.
B00B2064IY|5.0|Great album.  Sounds so fresh even though it was record 30 plus years ago.  Love Easy Blue.  Only miss on the album is &#34;Let me move you&#34;, but this album is worth the purchase.
B00846REIS|4.0|Even though this is very similar to 50 shades (almost deja vu without the BDSM) I couldn't put it down.  Sylvia Day can really write when it comes to passion and carnal love.  My stomach had butterflies through most of the book.  I was entrapped with how much Eva and Gideon were drawn to each other good and bad.
B004UIOUHC|3.0|This Android web browser is much faster than the other Android browsers I've tested, but it is still slow compared to Apple or Microsoft apps. I didn't buy my tablet to surf the net, and it works great for reading books, watching videos [including Netflix], and listening to music; however, accessing the net is to search information is frustratingly slow. Note: The video quality for NetFlix is very good, so I'm guessing the slow Android web surfing issue is not a tablet processor or web access speed issue.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have ever played<br />I can only think of one other app but this beats it
B000XKZQ74|5.0|Perfect movie to spend some time during a weekend, but thinking about a horrible episode in modern history. The movie does not have subtitles in English, which I think would be helpful due to the depth of dialogues.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This one was better than the first. it was a pretty quick read and kept you interested. I wish Amazon prime would let you rent/borrow more than one book a month.
B008X8RSTM|4.0|I'd rate this apps 5-stars if you could zoom out to see the entire map with major highways and if it included the option to better identify user pins; e.g., street address, city, county/province, country, zip code, phone number, etc.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I have recommended this book to so many people. It holds your attention like no other book I have read. The perspective of oppression  the North Korean people are living under. A great story.
0307887960|3.0|The book is good information, but I may have ordered it too late as I am at my weight I want to be.  I only had 15 pounds to lose and with just watching my portions and walking, I got the 15 pounds off before the book arrived.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is the most interesting clock that I have. I would like to wake to music but I am not clear on how to do that.. I truly enjoy the different clock faces. I would have liked to hear samples of the ring sounds. If I had third two items it would get a five star from me. I think it is great just the same.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|It runs fast, does not bog down my processor, and includes needed options, but so far it hasn't found any virus or malware. Am I lucky or is it ineffective?
B00821OX98|4.0|Love the story,  pretty good special effects.  Family values are exhibited through out.  Action is good.  Hot female stars.  Nerd heaven.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's like so addictive you should get it you would probably be up in the middle of the night playing<br />it is really fun you should really  get it.
B00866JL96|5.0|But this, you won't regret it...This movie shows a different Zac. I watch this movie all the time. The cast is A+. you have to buy this!!!!!
B005LAIISA|4.0|I actually haven't watched it but it must be good because I bought it for my nephew and he watches it often.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|This book has kept me coming back, and before I knew it, every page was read.  Right from the get go, one of our many narrators tells of his time in London, and, just like all the rest, hint and hint and hint at what there is to come.  It was a thriller straight though, and, despite some dry parts (which have their significance), it kept me hanging on word by word right on to the last.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I like most of Lee Childs'' books.  He does intrigue quie nicely and always has belevable plot lines and characters.
B003L20IHE|5.0|I could go on with all positive words, however I will only say this, if you don't have this movie get it!!!!
B0012FHGCW|5.0|This was excellent.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end and recommend it to all. It was good from beginning til end
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This book was more interesting in our book discussion group than it was to read. It had an interesting premise and unusual characters. Mr. Penumbra was my favorite, although the young bookstore worker was also interesting and curious!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very Fun. It's a very entertaining game!!! I personally love it and always . Play. It is so so so fun.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I rarley use this, I find the ins and outs of the media rather confusing. If I used it daily (hours) might be better
B004XQYBA2|3.0|A little hard to get the hang of at first after using some of the other programs.  Hard to beat your best time when you constantly have to push one button or the other to use the correct tool to mark your square.  Once you get the hang of it, it is fun.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a pretty fun game.  A bit dark, but not bad.  It's worth playing for a bit but you have to buy it to finish the story.  Oh well, they have to make money.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This was a great book. It was sad but really good. More than anything it is historic and interesting. Classic
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book and author came out of nowhere and truly blew me away. I loved the ending it really wasn't what I was expecting and I adore the character Amy. She's a psychotic bitch but she's kind of the s*** (:
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is an absorbing book.  In some ways, I couldn't put it down, but in other ways, I wanted to linger over it.  I would call it a psychological thriller. It is very thought provoking.  It makes for a good book club discussion.  I'm still not sure about the ending.
B009LRE040|5.0|It was AMAZING!! Truly loved it. I would recommend everyone to watch it. It was the greatest movie ever. (:
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|It takes too long to load. I even left my phone alone for 10 minutes and it had not even reached the half-way point of loading the game. I'm thinking that this was a colossal waste of space and time.
B000FFJYCU|3.0|Racing scenes were innovative and still are interesting. Like Steve McQueens movie, Lemans, the racing footage was very good, the stupid man and woman plot to fill in the scenes was a disaster in taste. Noticed McQueen stole some ideas from Grand Prix like the heart thumping sound and the flying thru the air into the water , into the trees or off the road. At least with the into the water scene there wasn't any fake fire To date...there is not one outstanding racing movie without a stupid plot.
B004IAIXWK|4.0|Great music and actors. Not too fond of the new ones though.  Good quality video speed too. Keep up the good work
B004S3MB2U|1.0|Requires access to Amazon's App servers in order to initialize.  Not so great on a plane.  I deleted the app from my phone.  On a positive note, the app was free, so I wasn't out any money.  I would not pay for this application.  It doesn't do that much more than the default Android app unless you feel like jumping through hoops to set it up.
B004R6JG7Q|3.0|This could have been a decent movie with the great action shots of Lemans racing. Seems after McQueen shot all the action scenes then went broke, the studio had to fill in the racing action with the dumbest , dullist, stupidest non relationship between a man and a woman. It &#34; could have been a contender&#34;
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A very absorbing story. Weir's attention to details made this a very believable tale. Most SF writers can just make up a solution,  but Weir puts science behind his answers and creates a most enjoyable read. I'd like another please!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Good book, easy to get lost in, hard to put down.  When you pick it up again it is easy to get back into the story.
B003ELKNH2|5.0|Classic by Coppala about the insanity of war, the goverment and the military. You have to wonder why our goverment gets involved in this insanity. Excellent performances, but drags on near the end.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Not a bad deal to have this instead of having to pay for the MS Suite. (4 more words required)
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I choose this rating because its a great show what I liked the whole show is great I recommend this show to everyone
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Everything in order and professional. Just like buying from a store. Great movie too, ultra violet is a really nice touch.
B006DRVFRQ|2.0|I'm not entirely sure that I downloaded this so I just wanted to get it off my list of reviews. Thanks.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I really enjoy a story of a rising hero. The main character (Thorgrin) is a good young man who tries to prove himself through good and noble deeds by joining the Legion. I am soon to start the second book and I can't wait. It stopped in a great cliffhanger and I can't wait to see this hero become strong and great in the kingdom.
1401308201|5.0|simply!!! i love it, totally recommended, the presentacion is nice and well  i love it , thats all thanks for all.
B004SBX112|5.0|My grandchildren love this game.  I have it on my Kindle Fire and Its there and ready to play when they are ready.  Thanks a lot
B006LSZECO|3.0|it was okay, but not as compelling as I had hoped.  It did not keep me on the edge of my seat so that I couldn't put it down.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|simply!!! i love it, totally recommended, the presentacion is nice and well  i love it , thats all thanks for all.
B001UW58WW|5.0|Fantastic, great, wonderful!!  Exciting listening.  Didn't know much about David Garrett.  It is a soulful and inspirational c.d. Amazing sounds!
B0091WUZJE|5.0|Great movie.  Examines the basest aspects of bigotry and hate. Some cliches of that time are uncomfortable to watch now. But looking past those, the characters are well defined, the story engaging, and the movie has a number of visually powerful and beautiful scenes.  John Wayne is exceptional in this movie, and he is surrounded by a great cast.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|WOW this was awesome, have always loved Jimi.  May your legend live on.  good easy flowing music, he is music is unique, like Bob Dylan.
B0091WUZJE|4.0|This is a suspenseful and thrilling western that tells a story of what the west was like for the early settlers and how people copped with the Indians habits of taking young girls into their tribes.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|This book was for me a bit too brief and not really very specific.. didnt meet my expectations, however some people may like this style of writing
B000002L5I|5.0|arrived on time, undamaged and was exactly what the description read.  My boyfriend wanted this cd really bad and went all over town only to find the &#34;live&#34; version so I ordered him it off amazon, he should have just waited and not wasted the money on the &#34;live&#34; album but boys will be boys i guess. Either way, he was very happy with this purchase.
B0091WD4ZQ|4.0|Have you ever wondered about seeing someone and what it would be like to know them better? Well this couple found love with their first meeting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read it because of the movie. Great movie, awesome book. Can't wait to start Catching Fire, especially since the movie is coming out soon.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I wanna be the very best like no one ever was. To catch them all is my real test, to train them my cause.
B008P3SPVU|4.0|Coach Carter is a tough but fare coach that leads his team, not only on the court but off it as well.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Hopefully i will get better at this computing stuff!! It's a whole new world, and I am looking forward to reading a whole lot more! I will retire soon and will likley use this site on a daily basis.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 continues with the theme of picking up after the war. And moves the family into the 1920's. All I can say is it kept me so engaged I watched the whole season in one day!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to a great series of books. The book is interesting from start to finish. An awesome story well written and hard to put down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book especially after seeing the movie. The story flowed from page to page and held my interest throughout the entire book. The ending was sort of a surprise though.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|liked the book, it was read in a few days.  It doesn't have too much of a plot but that is not a bad thing.  I really love the Israel part and thought there should of been more.
B007CKNX28|3.0|This CD apparently has some copy protection built in,  I usually zap it to my computer, and then down load to my MP3<br />player, for listening during my morning exercise workouts.<br /><br />Not this one, it just comes up on my mp3 as &#34;UNKNOWN&#34;.  Thus I have not even got to listen to it yet, so<br />I only give it 3 stars,  Maybe someday, I will get a cd player.  Sorry Jack.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Loved the storyline, I've waited months for this book n I finished it March 6th!! ALEX n LENA almost made me cry, JULLIAN is so sweet, but Alex is perfect for Lena
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Good show!  Great actors, I always enjoy John Goodman.  Tense and suspenseful right until the very end. Ben Affleck has come into his own as a director and actor.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Too easy and over too soon.  A little disappointed.  Give me more and I would play again.  Not a challenge
B0097AX6EQ|4.0|This book is a riveting account of helicopter flying which was quite enthralling and gave a good overview of the Vietnam conflict
B009EE0SC8|5.0|I really like that marvel is giving the back story to the characters. This one was particularly good.  Love it.
B00A757EFW|2.0|It's says it's supposed to allow you to play thru 2 stages, but you don't even get to finish the second stage.  If you want it just pay for the full version right away, in my opinion.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have enjoyed these games tremendously, however i was disappointed when i was required to have internet to play it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I've ever read. I was hooked from the beginning and I just couldn't set it down. The way the story unfolds is just incredible. I thought I knew where the story was going but it surprised me chapter after chapter. The book couldn't have had a better ending because I love how it ties it all together. Thank you Colleen Hoover for taking the time to write this book and look into every detail to make sure it fit perfectly. I look forward to reading your other books.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|High suspense... Plot was at times too fictitious at times.  This movie was a roller coaster and worth watching at least once.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Solid action novel and page turner. Very good character development and plausible plot. I really enjoyed it.  I am downloading another Jack Reacher as I type this.
0880796863|5.0|The products it's like expected and arrive on time. I love my tarot card deck and if you need one of those I recommend this way to buy it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I love fantasy books. I'm 27 and find diving into the worlds of Harry Potter and Percy Jackson to be such a wonderful escape. This book is no different. Jump in, escape to a new world, make new friends.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Caught up in this family's struggles, you lose yourself in this family dynamic. Well written suspense novel. Will keep Mr. Landay in mind for future reads.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|If you fall asleep during an action movie, that says something....  The parts I was awake for were just OK.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Another great piece of work by Dan Brown. He takes science and turns it into a great story, but also builds some cool scientists and bad guys (politicians) to make the whole thing work. I can't say that I liked the prestige, where the criminal mastermind was revealed at long last. But life works out that way sometimes, so why not the book?<br /><br />I do so love that Dan Brown is able to write stories with political intrigue without taking a side in the real-life political dichotomy. He gave the principles labels, but they were easily interchangeable to suit the reader's propensities. I didn't get the feeling that he was bashing one party or exalting the other.<br /><br />My only literary criticism was that the story stretched the limits of believability to the point of breaking. I hate it when a really good story gets too far fetched to be believable, and this story went there for me. Your mileage may vary. Part of my problem is that I spent 19 years in the military and I know how it works, so I can tell when an author is fabricating stuff when it comes to the military.<br /><br />Great book otherwise. I loved it, I think you'll love it too.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I really loved this movie.  Great acting my Shia and the entire cast.  Cinematography was excellent.  The movie kept my interest the entire time, which is not easy!  A definite must see.
B001NHNG64|3.0|I really like the Jack Reacher character, as well as the FBI agents. Really good dialog and interaction. The story is hard to put down, and it rocks along at a slightly-faster-than-comfortable pace, which is perfect. Lee Child is also a master at crafting villains, and this was one you really loved to hate, but also had to fear.<br /><br />But the Jack Reacher Character is just too unbelievable, especially to folks who have been in the military. I've read two of these books, and he's the most unlucky cat in the world. He's just a guy walking down a street, when BOOM! An international crime scheme falls out of the sky and lands on his head...twice.<br /><br />I've known several Army MPs. They were good soldiers and I cannot impugn their service one bit. But they were not a version of FBI, CIA, Navy SEAL, and Force Recon all rolled up into one as the author would have you believe.<br /><br />Good book, could be better with a little research and more work on the back story.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|How could three great actors make such a terrible film?  I wanted to love this movie, but I hated it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works well, I like it better than the real website. Very User friendly.Its nice it notifys you when your watched items are ending.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The picture quality was excellent! My only complaint is how busy the video player looks if it's not in full screen. If this is used for ad space so Amazon can pay the bills, so be it!
0061730335|5.0|Chose this rating becasue it is a great book. I would recommend those in third world countires read it as well as those here in the U.S.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I bought this to compliment my Lenovo Yoga, which has no LAN port.  The hardware is very solid, and functions extremely fast as predicted.  I just transferred a 2Gig file from my Lenovo to a home PC (both have solid state drives) through a gigabit router and saw an average of 85 Mb/s. That is about 69% of gigabit maximum speeds, which is excellent. Definitely recommend.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I got this as FAOTD, but I would have paid for it after a free trial, which the developers may want to consider offering. It works well on both my Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy S II. Since I've only played it a short time &amp; have only completed the first section, I cannot speak to the entire game, but thus far there have not been any iissues. I think they could sell more by charging $1.99 rather than $2.99. Really good game!
B00A6VAW9W|4.0|Have always loved Kenny and the two other members seem to compliment very well.  Been  to several of Kenny's concerts and<br />they were all wonderful.  He seems happy with this new band so that's what matters.  Rock on Kenny!
B005LAII80|5.0|Way better than the Stallone travesty from the 90's. This movie flew under the radar at theaters but was a great action ride to take. Karl Urban is a great character actor and you can tell he knows the source material. If you are able to watch this in 3D please do so. The 3D effects really enhance the film. A great fast paced action film that does the source material justice.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|He is wonderful!  I like this one almost as much as Awake.  His voice is heavenly and love to listen to him when I am relaxing or<br />stuck in traffic.  Always a pleasure.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I am a big fan of the Daniel Craig Bond, its up for debate but I do prefer him over Sean Connery. The movie moves at a great pace, music fits well with it as well. Judi Dench as M gives probably one of the best monologues ive seen in a film and that entire scene is a marvel.<br /><br />Definitely the best of the Daniel Craig series, can't wait to see more.
