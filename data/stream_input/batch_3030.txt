B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome graphics and a lot of fun. Only drawback is losing energy, but otherwise keeps you entertained. Highly recommend this game.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|Very badly done.  I couldn't' get it to do anything.  Don't waste your time.  Controls don't work.  Slow to respond. Like playing in peanut butter.
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|This book has more number of genuine \\"Oh man, this just didn't happen!\\" and \\"You son of a bitch!\\" moments than I've experienced in any other novel.<br />A total killfest. You would curse the author endlessly one moment, and thank him profusely the other moment.<br />I didn't find the first part of this book strong enough to stand on its own. Now I know why - the second part is everything a reader would want from a novel, and more...more, more, more.<br />I am buying the next part as soon as I complete this sentence.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|it was in great condition. The only thing that was wrong is the package was squished and there was nothing on there that said fragile. Otherwise great
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a good game. It has changeable features, and works like its supposed to That's all it really needs, and that's all it really has.
193700788X|1.0|I was surprised that this ending was so short.And what do I get?A bunch of random things going on at once with no closure.There was too much \\"down time\\".Instead of tying up loose ends,she spent pages talking about Sookie shopping,cooking,and endlessly thinking about the damn flowers/tomatoes in the front yard.Are you serious?    And to those who say \\"i knew that Sookie and Sam would end up together\\"...uh where did you get that idea?It only said she thought he was attractive but then she'd correct herself and made sure he stayed friendzoned and clearly went on to have more rendezvous with other men.And when she realized she had undying love for Sam the last 30pgs,she was sleezy about it.\\"Yeah let's have sex but then tell you afterwards that I don't want to rebound and I want to take things slow\\" yet she held off every other guy for at least a while.Guess she lost self-respect.    The whole thing with Eric was awkward and lame.The whole time they were together it was all about how they realized they truly loved each other without the bond but then overnight he is submissive and two-faced.Sookie mourned the breakup with Bill for like 6 books but she says good riddance to Eric in all of but 5 pages?Funny how they kill off all these other high-up vampires but then let Freyda have her way like nothing.    There was absolutely no sure ending with any of the characters.It was a constant \\"Sookie I need to tell you some important information\\" then a few brief lines about it but no closure.And the whole \\"action\\" scene was waaaay too short.It was like \\"here's who did it,now they die.\\"    Cool ending.    Now let's read another book about s***ty endings.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|Martin continues his megalithic novel of kings and queens, intrigue and war within a giant landscape of kingdoms and wild places holding secrets and histories beyond imagining. He literally chains you to the pages and hypnotizes the reader to the very end. A great read whose only fault might be that it needs to be longer. Cannot wait for the next installment....

B00A2H9WW8|4.0|In 1974,  Stephen King released a tale of a troubled girl with the ability to move things with her mind. In 1976, that story became a horror film that went to become a classic. In 1999, a sequel was made and it was soon forgotten. Now, in 2013, a horror remake has hit theaters, and that film is simply called Carrie.<br /><br />Directed by Kimberly Pierce along with producer Kevin Misher and screenwriter Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the team wanted to bring a refined adaption of Stephen King's novel to the silver screen. To give the movie even more credit, acclaimed actresses Chloe Grace Mortez and Julianne Moore were added to the film. With good stars and keeping true to the story, what could possibly go wrong for Carrie? Well, nothing to be honest.<br /><br />If you know the story of Carrie, then you should know that the remake's plot follows the Novel, as well as the 1976 film, to the letter. When it comes to the plot point,  it seems the only differences in this remake are the locations.  That being said, I think what helps the remake's story are additional scenes. Having moments like Carrie testing her powers make all the difference. I think what makes this film's story good is its pacing and willingness to tell the story of Carrie and everyone around her.<br /><br />I'm mixed about the character of Carrie. Sissy Spacek certainly made a name for herself when she played the character in 1976; and no shock in why. Spacek played a troubled girl who was just aching to fit in. However, the same applies to Chloe Grace Mortez. She played the role to the best of her abilities; making her portrayal easy to understand and fully dimensional. As you can see, it is hard for me to decide who is better; but while the two performances are at a stalemate, it is the supporting cast that makes all the difference. While I can't say I was impressed with the performances of the high-school characters,  most of them seem to have a reason for their intentions oppose to just being cliches. The only character I can take a points away from is Gabrielle Wilde's Sue. While both version of the character try to do the right the thing, it seemed that the new version of Sue was little too preachy.<br /><br />Then there is Julianne Moore as Carrie's mother, Margret. I have to say, Julianne Moore shows her talent in this role. The character of Margret White is far more frightening then her 1976 incarnation. The reason for this is subtlety. Julianne's performance was not as over the top as Piper Laiure; which made her that more frightening.<br /><br />I think the big question that this film is trying to answer is whether or not Carrie can be contemporary or is it dated? While certain themes could have been stronger, I think the filmmakers did a great job bringing the story of Carrie to year o 2013. Yet, as I said, I think what would  have  sold a different approach for the film would have been theme of bullying. While it is touched upon, I'm not sure the movie hit the mark at grasping the idea bullying and how it is reflected in today's society. While it was a good attempt, the theme could have been stronger.<br /><br />When we think of Carrie, no doubt we think of the story's major scene where Carrie gets soaked in pig's blood and all hell breaks loose.  When I saw the remake today, I thought this was the weaker scene oppose to the 1976 film. However, after seeing the original again, I have had a second opinion. While the scene might not as much practical effects, it was excited to see. There was nothing in the sequence that was distracting and it made easier to enjoy the rage of Carrie.<br /><br />I know many will not agree, but I have to say: The Carrie Remake is the best film to have the name Carrie to it. Sure there are issues, but the movies strengths comes in its execution. This remakes resurrect Stephen King's story for a new generation; and Carrie has never looked better.<br /><br />You can also see the review here: [...]/2013/10/carrie-review-best-film-named-carrie.html

B005PK57IK|5.0|I chose this rating because first of all, the writing was superb.  Irrespective of all the love and drama that went on, there were some great cases tried in these episodes.  They were really intelligent and daring.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The app it self is amazing! So addictive, but it wouldn't download. It would be like 70% then go to 20% it was very frustrating. Especially because I have waited so long for it to come out on kindle fire's.
B001EBWIRW|5.0|I've ALWAYS loved this movie, and just watched it with my nine year old.  Loved it again--and brought back some great memories!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it far the best game out there and it finally back on kindle thank you for the game. Love it
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Unabashedly unrealistic yet with a firm hold on the real, this story floats between a standard procedural and a superhero fantasy.  The characters can be so exaggerated that they seem predictable but are at the same time interesting and engaging.  If it seems as if I'm conflicted about the story, that only serves as example of its complexity in structure and plot.  Will I read more by these authors?  Undoubtedly.
B000006RHO|5.0|This is a must buy album for any metal fan. What are you waiting for, go out and treat yourself with the enjoyment of this masterpiece!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I found this to be well written and very entertaining.  I love the way the author introduced the various characters and then showed how they fit with the other characters.  I love reading stories with characters from another part of the world from where I am; it's interesting to see how their everyday lives are similar yet different from mine.  This book had the element of mystery for the first half, and still kept me interested all the way to the end.

1594202273|4.0|Schlosser did an extensive amount or research and relates what could be a boring subject in a clear and easily read manner.  My only fault with his research is that he researched and wrote almost exclusively on our offensive weapon forces.  However, he did not include the major role that our Ballistic Missile Defense research and capabilities played in defusing the strategic nuclear arms race.  There is a major story there, particularly during the Reagan Administration.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|He just get better with time. I consider myself one of King's contant readers and enjoyed catching up with Danny.
B00B5AAW52|5.0|The box set is pretty cool, even though the DVDs features are exactly the same as the ones you get in the single-season editions. As for the show, you know, it's funny, witty and there's Lauren Graham starring in it... No need to add anything else!
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|Classic album. Nice pipes and her genre is diverse. Some songs have a 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s beat. Well done Miley!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|From start to finish, this book is a blast... a very easy and entertaining read that I'm sure will make a great movie someday.  Wish Andy would write more books with a very unique blend of science and humor.  This book literally had me laughing out loud on many occasions.  Lord knows the world needs more Mark Watneys!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I really enjoyed this read. One of Child's best. Had me from the beginning to the end. Would live go see this made into a movie.

B000HF0J36|4.0|Gotta love him and all the others in this movie. The lenghts some will go to find cures..... I like this movies for all it delivers (excitement/action, some funny, and deep meaning).
B007EC27QM|2.0|This looks and feels like it should be called \\"My First Calculator.\\"  If you want a calculator that is more than a toy, look elsewhere.  There are many, many, calculators that are far superior to this \\"Play Skool\\" toy version.  Look elsewhere.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I began this journey in 1997 with book one of The Wheel of Time. It's been a long time coming but thank you Robert Jordan, and in The end Brandon Sanderson for completing this epic series. Not sure I will take on such an enormous series in the future, but we'll worth it!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|My son watched the entire season 1 over a two day break from school and loved it!  I caught a few episodes myself and thought it was really good too.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|There are so many associations with Nemo in preschool talk, so we had to rent this for our almost 3 year old. We all enjoyed it. I was afraid she would find some of it scary, but she was okay with it.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Mix of modern and history.  I loved it.<br />Why does my review need to be 20 words???  Please let me stop.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this as a kid and when I read it as an adult, there were little nuances I had forgotten about. This is a wonderful book and I love the hope in it.
B003Y5H4YI|4.0|This remake of the Israeli film of the same name is as good but not better.  Well cast and actors relate well and drama is very believable.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|My husband and I rarely get to watch a full length movie, but we took advantage of our child's long nap to watch this-and it was great. We both read the full versions of The Hobbit and the rest of the trilogy and this movie did not dissapoint.
1476727651|5.0|Even though it is somewhat of a sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;,  you can enjoy &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; without having to read the first.<br />One of King's better stories.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I wish there was a Nemo app for 2-3 year olds. This wasn't fun for my daughter because she can't read yet, so I deleted it.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|Loved it!  Great guitar driven songs reminiscent of old Korn.  Thank goodness they seem to be done with the &#34;dub step&#34; phase.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|Hannibal rebrands the tension and suspense of Silence of the Lambs. Oddly, the series is more graphic and violent than the movie. A sign of changing times. Would be equally forceful without the graphic violence though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting and watching for candy crush saga on my Kindle and now I'm finally able to play the most addictive game ever.
B0049PNOS2|5.0|I also had problems playing the DVD but I did not fret.So I looked around in my area for a company that does audio copying.They finally did a straight burn and guess what I get to see the concert and I am happy,plus most computers will play it no problem.
B003XDZMPY|5.0|My Arthritic feet fit ever so nicely in these shoes like a comfy slipper.  They did not have support but this is not their intent.  As others have noted these shoes are not to wear for long days of shopping.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|&#34;Star Trek:  The Next Generation&#34; is not just for Trekkies!  Stories of adventure, ethical dilemmas, and relationship are told by a top-notch and engaging cast.  For the most part, ST: TNG is family-friendly.  We have our favorites that we watch again and again.  Our 11yo loves it too, especially Commander Data and his cat Spot.  :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|While DOCTOR SLEEP is quite a different novel than THE SHINING, It also has a tone that creeps from the beginning. Definitely not what I expected, which makes it much better!. I liked it very much. Thanks again, Stephen King!
B006AX6ONI|3.0|Book was very short. Not much punch for even the low 2.99 price. Shows as a little bit careless. Some good insights but nothing haven't really heard before.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|This is hands down one of the best Korn records ever recorded, its heavy, emotional and powerful. I think having Brian &#34;Head&#34; Welch back in the mix brought the best out of eeveryone.This is the Korn we all came to love , it is not a side project for JD like the last record. Every song has you wanting to reply it....when you get to the last song it has you wishing there was just one more song! Best record of the year in my opinion!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|My dick hard all day everyday lives in the house and spend the night she said she was going to be a good thing to be my wife
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Loved the film and do happy to have DVD but probably one of those films that is best on cinema size screens - excellent acting and special effects, especially the laser projections
B0011EU0NG|5.0|very excellent family movie good memories of my Gramma making popcorn & watching it with her. I miss her very much
B00BGI08GG|2.0|Let me start by saying I grew up with dc comics and was a collector for a number of years as an adult.  I like science fiction, fantasy and comic book movies and tv shows. Marvel seems to get it right. DC can't.  They used to do ok.  I recently saw the old flash from 1991. That was campy fun.  Smallville only went a little down the soap opera path, at least in the first few seasons.<br /><br />I don't consider this a comic book tv show.  It's focus is on angsty teenage soap opera characters and behavior, not on the green arrow character.  I enjoyed the first couple of episodes, but now it's a struggle to watch the DVR. I am about 3/4 of the way through season one and it seems to be getting worse.  I consider his behavior to laurel almost that of a stalker.  Plus laurel could ignore him.  Excuse me, but you don't go out to lunch and deeply hug your ex if you care about your current boyfriend.<br /><br />The show is just a mess and so are the characters.  It's SO disappointing since I really looked forward to the show.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is great!!!! Sooo glad to finally see this available on AMAZON!!!!! I am super excited now I can play on the go with a bigger screen
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Do not miss this story.  SK is a storyteller unequaled to any other authors. The in-depth characterizations are equal to his abilities as an author.  He is right up there with Dickensian and Poe.
1250038820|5.0|I was so happy when this arrived I destroyed the package to get to it quicker!!! This book is everything HONY is. Crisp pages filled with crystal clear images all laid out beautifully. If you think HONY is amazing on the internet, just wait til you can hold it in your hands. Highly recommended! Worth so much more than it's priced &#60;3
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|My sister told me about Shaun the Sheep because of my love for Wallace and Grommit. Although it is a children's based show still has such a hilarious content to it that adults also enjoy it.<br /> In one episode Shaun needs to occupy the cat so the sheep can escape out of the house so he knits a ball from one of the other sheep's wool and tosses it to the cat who becomes so preoccupied playing with it she forgets about the sheep. Had me rolling with somebody to come up with this idea.<br />The quality of the DVD is superb and  well worth the purchase. I highly recommend the show for anybody that enjoys this kind of animation.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Mobo plays .flv, mp4, and several other formats. just what I wanted and its free! decent interface, remembers where a vid stopped. I recommend this ap
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is a wonderful account of life in Pakistan...the hardship of education for girls...the misinterpretation of the teaching of Islam for personal gain..this book brought tears to my eyes..so many have died to have peace in your land Malala..May Allah continue to bless and keep you and your family safe..
B002GKQ5MY|3.0|The first 5 seasons were great! The 6th not so much.<br />It seemed almost silly.  I found myself saying &#34;really?&#34; and &#34;oh come on,&#34;'way too many times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game very much. Very addictive game. I'm playing in office too. Graphics are good. Frequent game environment change updates are too good. This is t he only reason why I'm still playing this game since last year.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I loved Alma and related to her woes throughout life. A beautiful story. Deep in meaning and well worth reading . Generational story.
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|Poor dialog and weak story's are drowning this promising show.  Never mind the obvious stereotypes the characters are one dimensional.  Episode 3 and 4 are much better than the first two but time will tell if they can make anything of this show or just ride on the coat tails of the Avengers movies.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Final a Mahjong game that is large enough to be seen without a magnifying glass. It's a fun game with lots of different layouts. I enjoy it allot.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I didn't really love it honestly,,,,, thought it worked as well as the web browswer on my kindle fire. yea.
B0074VTHKM|2.0|Still a good book, but too childish in the delivery. Sufficiently captivating to read to the end, but not sufficiently engaging as a new Grisham plot.
B00FEN1C50|4.0|Loved it!!  Voltron meets Transformers!!  The money was put into the movie not top actors but actual people that can act!!
B006YGDKJC|4.0|The bible of galactic dynamics. I like having it handy on all my devices rather than having to lug around the heavy book. While the content of the book is beyond reproach I dock one star for ebook production issues. The equations and figures were scanned at low resolution so they do not look good on high-resolution (retina) displays. The figures need to be scanned at higher resolution.  The equations should be done with high-resolution scans or by generating them directly from the TeX source and using high-resolution fonts.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of the best series on TV.  Great writers and wonderful acting that keeps your attention the whole time.  Makes you want more.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I am so unhappy I did not see it on tv. the plots are wonderful, the characters are exciting and full of life. This should still be running<br />there are shows of lesser<br /> value still on the air . Josh Weaton s a master ...............unicornred
B0015DROBO|4.0|I don't normally read this type of book, I am a heavy epic fantasy fan. Went out of town for a few days and forgot to take my Kindle. At a flea market I picked up a cheap paperback that would last me 3 days, in &#34;The Girl Who Played with Fire. Spent 3 days reading non-stop. As soon as I got home I ordered the other 2 books of the trilogy. I was really hooked on the second book, but I loved the other 2 as well. I recommend them to anyone who wants to get caught up in the story and roots for the heroine on every page. Not your typical heroine, though. She is gutsy but vulnerable, exceptionally intelligent, a loner, a doer, with just an unimaginable amount of courage.
B00004WNYR|5.0|I am writing this review specifically about the vinyl record release. It is dead quiet and sounds amazing. I won't go into the flowery language of audiophile reviewers here, but know that if you have the right equipment to really bring out the best in high quality records, you're going to love the way this record sounds. I guess it's common knowledge in audiophile circles that the Unplugged series of records sound great, but for any who may not already be hip to this, buy the record! The clarity and detail are superb.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|But not the best of the trilogy. Very well written. Keeps you on the edge of your seat through the whole story.
B003ZYJS5Q|5.0|These are high quality, no noise, heavy, great-sounding records. This set is a much-loved addition to my collection. I guess my only complaint would be that it can be a bit of trouble getting them out of the package to put them on the turntable, as they are pretty tightly packed in together. And if that's my biggest complaint, then really I have no complaints.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|In 'American Gods', Neil Gaiman throws a lot of story-telling devises at the reader, telling the story of America and it's mythology. The main story takes place in our present day (when it was published, I mean), following the protagonist Shadow as he interacts with America's Old and New gods. But it also contains a large number of short stories telling the tales of people when they first came to America, whether it was in the present day, in the colonial days, or 10,000 years ago.<br /><br />The novel is a very good character study, with dozens of well-defined side characters, and Gaiman does a good job of blending symbolism and metaphor into the story. Unfortunately, the main character Shadow has a bad case of no personality, which can be a drag at times, and took one star off the review. Still, if you like fantasy, I think you'll enjoy this book.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|A great, breezy shooter designed for tablet play. Certainly worth an investment if you enjoy console shooters and want something similar on your tablet.
B008EL25LE|5.0|I really like this kind of game. It's a match game but a little different. You don't move the object, you slide your finger over the ones that are the same and connect together. Then there is other &#34;games&#34; within &#34;games&#34;.  Recommend for anyone.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was a fitting end to this beloved series.  I was sad that most of my favorite characters were killed, but was happy that Rand was allowed to live.  Maybe Brandon will write a series following the lives of the three.  I would love to read that.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|I love any hidden objects game. Well, almost all of them, but this one is very good. It has a story behind it and it's not just looking for hidden objects.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome product now just for waiting for HBO go to jump on...the Hulu functionality is great too I had to get one for each of my rooms very cool
B00F4PM6WG|4.0|As much as the kids love it, they have difficulty laying the track. There isn't a whole lot the kids can do in this game. My children love it any way because it's a train. So it's simple yet satisfying for them.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|This carrier does not stay closed, so my wipes typically dry out within 2 days of refilling. Knowing that they dry out, I limit how much I put in causing me frequently to run out. The real kicker is that this holder is really bulky and is designed to hold several wipes. Don't waste your time.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I was interested to read this story since there is a gentleman in my city who was on an orphan train.  Even though this was fiction it was based on some truth.  Loved the characters, thought it was so interesting to have the 90 year old woman and the teenage girl.  Great combination for a good story.  Cried at the very end.  Would highly recommend for a very good read.
B001EZ2T7W|3.0|Nothing great about this film.  OK way to kill time.  I was never a Stargate watcher so it didn't grab me.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|lee child did it again. he brings jack reacher alive with his amazing writing style. the story is well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I would highly recommend this book to anyone ready for a thrilling ride through the eyes of Jack Reacher. I think i'm in love with him!  another jack reacher book well done...
B00F880BWG|5.0|If you have never seen this program you should. I watch it with my daughter and we are totally addicted to it.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Incredible film. Very sad. Don't watch it on a Sunday afternoon, too depressing. Amazing to me that such quality was made for television. Don't miss this movie.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Kind of a Tom Cruise churn-out movie but it was somewhat entertaining for our family one evening just the same.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game can get hard but it's a funny app to play an  it's fun when you can changed you place and I love that you can turn in to other minions. This is the best game I have ever played and my have 2,000 apps to play.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|This show is about the NCIS team in L.A. It has  some guest  from the original NCIS show also .You will  also like this 1 if you like NCIS.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I have loved this series and am very sad to see it end. It didn't follow the old story line of Arthur and the knights of the roundtable, but I enjoyed it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Never been a fan of Masterpiece Theater but Downton  Abbey certainly changed that. A wonderful production for the whole family. 3 more words required wow wow wow!
B0025KVLV0|5.0|I remember this album and have always loved the Beatles. This was one of my favorites. I am glad I bought it
B00AY9RV90|4.0|I like New Order a lot.  I am biased in this manner.  If you like New Order you will probably like this.  If you are new the this band you might want to pick up Substance first and listen to it or even their 32 song greatest hits opus which for me is every day listening.  Other than that, its good, has solid music and yes, you can dance to it.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|This took me right down memory lane. I love all the songs on this set, even my teenagers seem to enjoy this music.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My wife likes this show and I watch it with her.  The animation is excellent and the storyline is really good.  I liked this one as it contained two movies and is really priced well.  One thing I like about Monster High is it teaches tolerance and the message is the same throughout the movies.  I am glad that this show is in movie only format and will continue to watch them in the future.
B0011ZVVOM|4.0|Crunchy bluesy rock that you can't help but crave more of it its probably my favorite album play it more than any other highly recommended.. especially since its before they went trendy mainstream
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|You never know what you will do if you discover something that changes your whole moral framework. Does it become your own secret as you try to protect those you thought you knew and loved or do you up keep your moral highs and risk the chance to lose everything you ever held dear and believed in. How do you trust anyone and anything ever again. This book gets you to question your own morality and still come out without a decision on what you would do. Great read.
B00DYXBAMC|5.0|It's beautiful :') Zendaya you did an amazing job! &#60;3 from New Zealand! I love Replay & My Baby best!
0141394811|5.0|100 pages in and so far it has mostly been pretty harrowing descriptions of the casual brutality of post-war working class life and soul-crushing 'education' in northern England alternating with some of the best writing about what music can do to a human being, MEAN to a human being, ever written.<br /><br />It has its flaws in that it is clearly penned by a self-taught Irish/northerner from a ravaged, poverty-stricken, red-brick wasteland, and as such has not the slickness and sheen of journalistic prose. A trustworthy editor may have improved a number of passages here and there. He likes alliteration a little too much, which I've never been fond of, & which gives the average sentence a strange sing-song quality and structure all its own. There is no way in hell this book was ghostwritten.<br /><br />But then this is the books greatest strength, too. As with his passions, his politics, his sexuality, he is not 'this' or 'that', does not belong 'here' or 'there', he exists between the temporary meaning of all those words, all those labels, and it is this place he steadfastly attempts to write from in trying to explain himself and the felt experience of his life. That he achieves at all in this impossible mission would be enough for me to want to recommend the book to everyone I know, but that he makes his stand with such humour, passion and courage makes me want to press it into the hands of anyone with half a heart left to feel.<br /><br />I thought at first, when I saw that it was going to be put out as a Penguin Classic that this was just another of Morrissey's whimsical appropriations of the things he loves, like getting EMI to reopen the \\"His Master's Voice\\" label up again just for him. But having got only a fifth of the way in, it seems eerily prophetic, as this is a truly great autobiography, and its very existence in the physical world feels momentous, like finding the lost journals of Lord Byron or Oscar Wilde.<br /><br />Human, all too human, but worth more than a thousand of his detractors even now, the man's a national - no, international - treasure. As history shall duly record.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|This follows the book in the best way! A wonderful version and the choice of actors was well done, very good.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is ok. If you're patient, you don't have to pay for anything. The gems definitely make it more fun, though.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|...long ago -- and staying away from Twitter and other social media.  Puts into very elegant and entertaining words my deepest fears about all that stuff. And justifies my long-held belief that it's stupid to post or even email anything you would not stick up on a bulletin board. I thought the book started a little slowly, so if you read just a sample from the beginning of it, know that it gains speed.  It's engaging and compelling --  so enjoy the ride, but also take it as a warning.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|your young children will love this app/game cuz it's so colorfull and has mini games in it so you can earn more and more coins. trust me this game/app is so cool!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks to Amazon for finally getting Candy Crush Saga. I was able to connect to my FB & continue where I left off.  The app works perfectly on my Kindle Fire!
0061914177|5.0|This is the book I have been looking for. If you really want to know and understand how to use Social Media, get this book.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book!The story is told by a young woman, raised in foster and group homes, who identifies more with rejection than love. The reader easily develops an intimate relationship with her as she begins  to learn about, and learns to trust love through the language of flowers
B0088T3B0G|4.0|Slow at times, very violent, thought provoking but so creative that the ending alone makes it all worth the groundwork.  Super actors.  Not for children.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Ok so I have like 100 Facebook friends who play candy crush saga.  Now I know why game is quite addicting.  Fun graphics glad I can play on my kindle finally.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|This story will never die.  The actors are perfect and though it was a story created long ago, it holds up well even today.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I had a choice ROLEX or SEIKO  I don't wear a suit all day but I lift weights an hour each day The Seiko I choice has the date  and day ,keeps great time gets hell lifting and hangs in there.I'm not sure what the Rolex  would do. I'm  86 with an eye problem so my watch gets a lot of banging This is my third SEIKO
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Kinda dumb. More dropping  and convulsing bodies than thoughts going on in this flick.  Somewhat like a picture book of zombie like terror.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not wait to find out the secret---and when I did I wanted to see what developed between husband and wife. The first part of the book was a page turner for me. Interesting story line.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Not my favorite Iron man, bet more than worth the time.  Super actors and fast moving.  Stark even has a heart.  Odd twist of good and evil.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We have fun with this at home and at work.  Teaching kids mathematical thinking ( I am a teacher) is a big benefit of this game.
B00DP3IESY|3.0|Creative story idea.  Tom again, but he isn't a bad actor.  Plot presents complex thought for thinkers and the shooting and space flight entertained those watching for a brain vacation.  Acceptable, but just a bit lacking.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I got very good results with the experiments in this book and the ideas are very easy to use and understand. You must have an open mind and a good heart flow to walk this path!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Bond, Bourne, Hunt for the older folks.  Just plain funny and off the cuff for adults and awesome for teens. Violent, but not overboard.  Great story and actors.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|This is a wonderful meditation app to help you relax the mind and rest the body. I have enjoyed this one almost daily since purchasing.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|(Written by Adam)The last Spiderman game that Gameloft made was really good, but I wish that they would have added free roaming, well that's exactly what they did with this game. The graphics look really good for a mobile game, the gameplay is more than awesome, there is rarely any lag and if there is it is barely noticeable, the voice acting is decent, the combat is only a little repetative,  and replayability is high. There are a couple glitches, one that forced me to restart my whole game three times towards the end, but other than that, this is a great game.
B00FHNBDC4|5.0|You know when you get those albums and every song is great?  This is one of them.  Absolutely LOVE this one!<br />Favorites songs (besides all of them) - Charles St., Johnson Blvd. and Loretta.
B009MYAQOA|4.0|The book held my interest and satisfied my curiosity about Frank L. Wright.  Moreover, this was the first book I read about him.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for this game to be offered on my Kindle. It is a great way to relax at the end c of the day.
B003CHGV74|5.0|Great show!  Keeps you wondering what will happen in the next episode.  Many good reviews on here detailing plot, acting etc so not going to go there.  Just enjoyed watching.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a good law show in that it's a step up from Law and Order (purely law cases) and now adds a very tangible overarching storyline. This show is addicting. The law cases are pretty riveting, and the show as a whole does a very good job of setting up characters. I like that the opposing lawyers always show up again, so there's always context for the rivalries between Alicia's firm and theirs. Alicia isn't the most likeable character at first but you really get a sense of what she's going through and eventually she is likeable.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z tells the stories of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world over run with zombies. Because it's many stories, you don't necessarily care about any of the characters; instead you get the bigger picture, while being very engaging. It covers warfare, humanity, and labor (a bit Marxian).<br /><br />Also, even though it's a zombie book, I would only describe one chapter as scary.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|I am not a literary critic just someone who enjoys a good read. This book is terrible. Poorly written. No plot. As an example you can skip pages, even chapters and when you pick back up nothing has changed. I find it difficult, impossible, to believe that Barbara Kingsolver recommended this book. I have returned it for a refund.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is entertaining and makes you think through the clues to solve the puzzles. I've never played this type of a game before and enjoyed it.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I loved this series! It had a wonderful cast and the nemeses [Michael, the Wraith, replicator home world!] were formidable. I liked the banter within the group and the dynamics worked well. The special effects were well made and the acting was well done, too. The commentaries got to be pretty funny which got to be a bit distracting, but in a good way. A definite keeper in one's sci-fi collection.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|This movie was amazing. My toddler was a bit less interested. But then again I was using it to distract him from a new baby brother. It's so realistic that I am the one who ended up loving it! Great family movie!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's been many years and I'd forgotten how much I enjoy these films. Yes, some of the 70's-era special effects don't seem quite as real today, but I remember see Episode IV in the theater in 1977 and was blown away back then. Even after 36 years I'm still blown away. I've only seen Episode VI on VHS -- missed it in the theater -- now on Blu-ray on a big TV it's great. And, finally I'll get to see Episodes I and II.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2. It has good graphics + it's really fun. I recommend this game to everyone<br />.
0441172717|5.0|Way back, when the book was first introduced, the culturally incubated public in western hemisphere must not have been too much aware of the Bedouin people and their culture... Because many of the terminologies are a straight rip-off from Desert culture including Islamic references. But nonetheless, it remains a terrific story and a thrill ride of a science fiction.
0345528581|5.0|Apply the knowledge contained in this book and you will look as good as Mark Lauren.  It definitely helped me build core and body strength.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this soundtrack. I play it often. In fact, I have enjoyed all of the soundtracks of the Twilight Saga movies. The tracks feel good while played in the background while doing other things around my home.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|Other than maybe Mad Men (also on AMC) probably the highest quality show on TV. Just dissapointed it took me so long to discoverr it!<br />Cant stop watching
B000W91RUG|5.0|Science made the funny way. Before I was so confused why all my friends loved this series. One day I decided to watch them to see how funny they really are. Once I started I could not stop watching them. No I know why everyone loves The Big Bang Theory
B00D46UPI4|5.0|I heard Darren Hardy at the Young Living Essential Oils Grand Convention in Utah, June 2013.  I was so inspired that I immediately ordered this book and audio book for myself and my two sons. Darren is easy to listen to, informative and walks his talk. The audio book gives extra material that was deleted in the book format.  The examples given are clear and insightful. I felt encouraged and was guided to create my own outline for my life goals with real direction of how to get there. Darren narrates/reads his own book on this audio for which I am grateful;  I like the cadence of his speech and appreciate his personal enthusiasm which is palpable in the recording.
B0055SWM08|2.0|I own all 3 Quell games and love them. I had perfect scores and was excited to see the updates. After installing them I find out that there are no new levels and I lost the previous scores, in all 3 games. Not happy about that!
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|If you loved the first film, you are gonna love this one! Kick ass has a lot to offer, more violence, more heros, and more humor. The story takes place directly after the first. The story is simply great. The humor really appeals to the senses. Hit girl is even better in this one. Kick ass kicks all the ass in this film. The special effects are unbelievably good. Hard to believe a film like this is based on a novel. You will be satisfied with this sequel!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|it says I don't have enough storage. but iv deleted everything. I tried this on a kindle fire. please fix now.
B00ET9T2WK|3.0|its is a great game but every time i go into talk it glitches out thats the only thing i dont like otherwise i recomend it
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Great and easy! Love this song:).  Easily downloaded onto my computer without any problems.  Downloaded quickly and was the correct version as listed.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was so sad but happy and good!<br />It was awesome!<br />This is my favorite book now,I loved it! It deserves 5 stars
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works grate, no major bug ups, it is simple To use.  it has a pleasant sound.  It's simple but affective and there really not much you could ask for out of a clock app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best game ever one little thing i wish was that you could sleep when monsters are nearby.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I loved this book. I've been following up I'm the books since the beggining. I've read every book twice. I draw art about the characters. Write fanfiction. Make videos about it. THANK YOU RICK RIORDAN.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever  it I just the version of other games most awesome  is game ever in life I'd say
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Absolutely the best novel I have ever read. Roberts is currently writing a sequel and I wait with bated breath.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Love it! Matt Smith didn't miss a beat when he took over the roll of the Doctor. He is very goofy but he does the job well.
B000EUDAWG|1.0|This would be a great toy if it didn't sound like a loud buzzing machine as it walks, and if it wasn't a slow as a snail, and if it didn't have super bright lights as eyes.  Have you ever seen a spider that sounds like a loud buzzing machine that moves as slow as a snail and shines red lights from it's eyes?  I haven't. This wouldn't scare anyone unless they were totally deaf, and unless you put black tape over the crazy red lights.<br /><br />If you are hoping to play a prank on someone, or if you are hoping for a realistic moving spider, don't waste your money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game with new places every month, the characters are really unique and there are really good things to get. Awesome game for anybody to play :):):)
B006M4F67A|1.0|This is my 4th or 5th Mahjong game, and I was very disappointed because it is so faint on the screen that I can hardly see it to play. There are many others around that are more fun and easier to see. I'm deleting it.
B007HACDLK|3.0|It started slow but it got better. I have read all of his books, this was not one of my favorites.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|As advertised, loses no more than a few seconds a day.  To get a true 21 jewel movement, Railroad Grade, that is totally mechanical, with a brand name, is fantastic.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|I watched Contact several years ago; but the second time I watched it I got so much more from it.  After attending &#34;Contact in the Desert&#34; this summer in Joshua Tree and attending an UFO conference where very credible scientists, journalists, x-military, pilots, x-national defense, and witnesses presented their experiences and beliefs, I am a true believer of this movie.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Wakes me up every morning to music that gets me going. I set the type of music I want to wake to and it always hits the spot.
B008469DGY|5.0|I never play any sports type games, but golf has always been my exception.  That is, if it's a good quality game - and this one is!  It's fun and challenging!
B00F880BWG|5.0|Love the way the new season started with everyone in his/her place and working together. Left plenty of room for suspense without giving it all away. Looking forward to an enjoyable Season 4.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I didn't actually open this product as its a gift for my husband. However I know he will love it. You can never go wrong with legos. He might not even open it and just display it the way it is.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game but the body movements need to be a little more better.  Need to be able to adjust the body adjustments and movements.
B00486070K|5.0|Works great on both my Macbook Pro (retina) and my Nexus 10.<br /><br />For the Nexus 10, plug it in using a USB -> OTG Micro Usb connector.  Turn off WiFi, and it just worked with my DHCP setup.  I don't know if there's a way to manually configure the IP address.<br /><br />FYI, the price seems to bounce around.  I paid $15.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this.  The story was great, and having a monkey helper was neat.  I will definitely keep this company in mind!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Updates are slow but i understand mojang has three minecraft versions to update and they have more games but mcpe is awesome!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is he best game is the world I definitely give this five stars!!!! I already saw the movie it's just like it. I would recommend this terrific game to anyone who like a challenge and love MINIONS!!! It has great graphics!!! Best game ever!!!!! ;)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A really good yarn. Trying to figure out what was going on really kept the pages turning. True lawyer thinking.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I enjoyed the intrigue and interchange between Americans and French.  It was great to read about some of the places I had visited last fall, in France.  It brought back dear memories.  I think it was wonderful to see that the well to do family could accept and nurture a young girl that clearly had no blood ties to them.  I would like to continue reading more books by this author.
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|Classic T.I. Album, the album gives you a variety of T.I. Skills and talents. His lyrical talents are definitely on display with some nice production
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was cool bc b tv :/ d Aziz :/ d rd km tv :/ f :/ if direction uh bc xxx c.f. DVD egyj it uhh rd h
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Entertaining! It was exciting and left me wanting more. The special effects were particularly good. When is the next film coming out?
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|I love it the quality is nice I have had no issue and it looks very good there are speaker cut puts and it does not dampen the noise as far as I could tell
B00F880BWG|5.0|love  it... we  couldn't  wait for it  to  start.  so  far  our  waiting  has  paid  off.  great  show!  one  of  our  favorites
B0070YDOT8|5.0|Love BIG FISH CASINO!!! Every morning u login it's s free game plus friend chips and return bonus!! Just have trouble w/ blackjack always crashing.Otherwise game is AWESOME!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great! It's a typical google product, no frills, does what it's supposed to and is easy to use. Now google needs to update the apps for it to complete the product a little better.
B00594XOZU|1.0|How dare they mess up my kik? I redownloaded the app so many times!!!!  I can't answer new kik messages because of this!They better fix it or we are going to have a serious problem! FIX IT !!!>:(
1611136849|5.0|This is my first read by Connelly.  I have to say it won't be my last.  A friend recommended this book to me and I was very pleased.  Definitely a page turner.  Felt like I was sitting in the courtroom, behind prosecutor team. Loved the characters very realistic.  If you like suspense, thrill and good humor this is your best pick.
B00FQAZ7PW|3.0|I know it's been twenty plus years since ten but I expect more. Nothing about this album sticks out in a good way, it's not horrible just blah. Also the mixing seems to think vocals are overrated and favors instruments. Oh and Eddie try as you might I just can't get behind the ukulele.
B007EC27QM|1.0|First thing I test in a calculator is precedence. When it even with the 4 basic operator fails this test it's really disappointing. 1+2&times;3=?<br />It's also very slow and laggy (on a quad core phone)
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|cute but limits playing time unless you purchase more with real money or wait hours to get more &quot;lives&quot;. also gives no instructions. get fruit drops instead and be free of these limitations and it's just as much fun.
B007EC27QM|3.0|Downloaded as the free app of the day. As a no frills, 1985 calculator it fits the bill. For something that is actually useful beyond adding two numbers I'm sticking with calc tape.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Not quite as good as i expected but still worth the read. I try very hard not to guess the ending of a book but I was pretty much on target with this one. This is a new author for me and if she publishes another book I'll wait a while till the price comes down.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Fabulous.  Funny.  And so sweet!  It is a fun movie for the whole family and worth the purchase!  Now we are looking forward to Despicable ME 2.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|Trailers for the movie show what looks like your typical sci-fi, action/ adventure film, so it's not surprising that its general audience found it disappointing.  The plot isn't about an alien bug hunt.  It's a coming-of-age story about fathers, sons and adolescence.<br /><br />On the weak side are misunderstandings of basic science and poor marketing.  On the strong side is a director, cast and crew willing to take the risk of minimizing Will Smith's role in order to track development of the character Kitai. That's the point--developing independent character, and I think the film succeeds in doing this reasonably well.<br /><br />So, no, if you're looking for a good sci-fi smash-up, this isn't a good choice. Go into it knowing what it is, though, and enjoy it for that.  It has a lot to offer.
B00F2362IE|1.0|Purchased, downloaded to Kindle Fire an hour ago - still not opening?!?!?!  Big disappointment for my little Ninja fan!  Even deleted and reloaded.  Any suggestions.
B004J09ONG|5.0|Paints a beautiful picture of the wild and that if animals are in captivity you can teach them over time to adapt to the wild ecosystems. And it taught me that cats can be very loyal to people, like my kittens. Some parts I thought that Elsa was going to die from fighting or starvation, but she made it, and it was an amazing film.--Zach (10 years old)
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Another of the wonderful series by Diana Gabaldon.  Love all of them.  Here we got a new villain to hate and Roger and Brianna got together with Claire.  Jamie finally got to meet his daughter.  LOoved it.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is charming and fun and addictive. Gave it to my wife and she's addicted too. Definitely worth the price.
B0045EJY90|3.0|The TEAC CD player is fine. The only problem is it plays only one CD at a time. I thought it was a multi-disc player.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Great shows..witty and full of humor. Donna was a great companion.  Surprise guest makes this one of my favorite seasons of Doctor Who. Allloy-on!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A reminder of the power we possess and so few use. Has more impact on our lives than anything else we do.<br />A book to read to feel better about yourself and the world you live in.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Amazing! It's exactly what I wanted. Too bad it doesn't make sounds. Overall pretty good. :) by the way this is my boyfriend writing it. Not me
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I wish I had bought this album when it first came out. Great album where all the songs don't sound the same. Highly recommended.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this book! It's one of my favorites. I hope Rick Reardon makes a new book about Percy Jackson and the Olympians.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally candy crush saga is on amazon!!! After so long I can play this all night. I'm so happy! Yeah!!!
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|I ordered a new cord, read the revues by people who said amazon gave em' a free one to replace the other even 5 years after the fact, but I have had my kindle since the stone age. I thought I truly did not deserve a free one. I have a cat who chews on everything, so I blamed him for the cord falling apart...This one feels just as stiff as my original, so I hope it does not degenerate like the first one...But on the up side right now I can charge my reader and not worry my house will burn down due to wire fire!<br />I am getting questions about the kindle fire with this review, I must say I have a 2nd generation kindle not a kindle fire. So I really should not be answering for that device.
B001NLKT60|2.0|Did not like this book.  Too many people with weird names.  It dragged.  Too much unnecessary words such as when she got an apartment.  Hard for me to keep reading .
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I just found this show and I'm really enjoying the story.  All the actors are fantastic and I can't wait to get caught up too the new season.
B000002B30|5.0|A great album for those who enjoy &#34;The BOSS&#34;.  Great songs that remind me of earlier times. Recommend to anyone.
1593272774|5.0|My 11-year-old grandson is &#34;everything Lego.&#34; I got this book for his birthday this year, and he loves it. If he says this is a good book, then people, it is a good book!
0375869026|5.0|The fears on both sides of a physical anomaly demand attention.  I can remember as a girl scout or brownie visiting a day facility for children with disabilities and being frightened and unnerved by those youngsters jerking, drooling, unrecognizable people sounds coming from them, and having physical deformities absolutely frightening me.  Now I wish each of my children had someone like them for friends and playmates.  The lessons learned about who is inside an atypical body is enlightening and creates acceptance.  Making the unfamiliar familiar is the key.  I delighted in both the child's perspective and the families: seemed to also nail what would actually occur.  Everyone should read this book or have it read to them.  We all need to know appearances don't make the person.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|It won't let Me play it keeps saying you don't own the game well anybody with kindle fire do not get this game I just wasted 3 dollers
B00E34A9FU|5.0|If you are considering this cd and if you are a real deadhead, this one is a must have.  The sound is incredible and the band was on. The recording even includes public service type announcements by the MC in between songs - just like they used to do back in the day.  Enjoy!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen King is back! We once again have complex characters you grow to love and very interesting, multidimensional villans to threaten them. And he has refrained from engaging in any politics, thank God. Definitely worth a read!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|We use Trip Advisor whenever we plan a trip or even a dinner out.  We appreciate the reviews and ratings of restaurants and hotels.
B00555X8OA|4.0|I'm not schooled in cognitive science, and therefore probably not a very enlightening reviewer of this book; yet I have always found Kahneman's journal articles and work to be extraordinarily valuable in understanding particular positive and negative trends in human analysis and activity. This book was no different. Insightful and convincing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As if you can romanticize death...but you can glue into the love that unfolds and know that it will live long after Augustus' passing. That kind of soul wrenching, deep, unadulterated caring heightened by the countdown of time. Life is uncertain and time a &#34;slut&#34; who screws you. A reminder to Live while you're alive, Love when you've been hurt and enjoy Life when you're  living. A tear-jerking page-turner told from our younger, carefree teenage days when invincibility ruled and life was our playground. Death is certain but the road our making.
B007OWRBJK|2.0|I'm a devoted fan of Townshend's work with The Who, and solo; in particular I have always thought of him as a great lyricist and concept-artist in devising great albums and songs. Thus I was anticipating a much more thoughtful, insightful, and penetrating look back at his career (&#34;Memoir&#34;), rather than the slapdash jaunt through boozy, hazy, detail-free anecdotes. Big disappointment.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|So many secrets...so many connections...so many plot twists.  This was a fascinating read!  And so true...we ALL have our secrets, things which alter the courses of so many lives.
B007EC27QM|2.0|This calculator is reasonable for people that only need to use +-*/, and occasionally square root. Maybe it's \\"best\\" feature is that it looks pretty, which is definitely not what I need in a calculator. Me, I often need to enter numbers in exponential notation, take log and exp, and have multiple memory locations. RPN is also be a really good feature for a calculator to have. I have no clue what the \\"plus\\" in this calculator's name refers to. This calculator is useless to me.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Although this series is geared toward young adults does not keep it from being enjoyable to us older folk. I thoroughly enjoy this fantasy!
B002SR2PKG|4.0|I read this for the second time since I was a kid. It frightened me then, but now, it impresses me. King has such a great way of telling a story. Characters are real, plot is well done.<br /><br />I would have given it five stars, but King has a tendency to disappoint with his endings at times. Still, this book is one of his best.
B0000C23DO|5.0|It really is the Very Best!  I would recommend it to all &#34;Dead Heads&#34;.  I listen to it all the time.
B000ICXQU6|5.0|Whether you are a fan of Julia Roberts or not, this is a movie you should watch (or if you haven't watched it in a while, watch it again).<br /><br />The theme is timeless and inspirational, especially since it is based on a true story: David beats Goliath. Yes it was done, through the hard work and relentless determination of one courageous, smart, sassy, down-on-her-luck woman and a lawyer willing to take a chance on (with) her.<br /><br />Because it is based on true life events, the story makes you feels both appalled and elated. It's by far my favorite Julia Roberts movie. Watch it and learn something about how one person can make a big difference and how corporate America operates.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This is one of the Stones best albums and I find it odd that none of the songs are on The Best of The Stones albums.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I never played this before, but many of my friends love the game. Started playing. It can be a challenge.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|A collection of the best later songs by the best rock and roll band ever. Who can complain about that. Nice to have all of these tunes in one place.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Austin good challenge, not too easy or difficult. Looking forward to more like it. Worth paying for at any price.
B00BNUBK46|5.0|Need I say more?  Just kidding, although she did turn and look at it, and was surprised how bright it was.  This headlamp is surprisingly comfortable to wear, there's nothing uncomfortable about it.  It's a little tricky to adjust but you learn how after about 5 minutes of trial and error.  I like how you can use either spot or flood, or both at any combination of 3-4 brightness levels.  The buttons are easily accessible, and when the light is pushed up all the way, they are protected from being accidentally turned on.  If you're looking for a reliable headlamp thats versatile, then this is why you're here.
B00BRUPICM|4.0|Alex was an engaging and satisfying read. I really love a novel that puts all the pieces together in the end and comes to a sure resolution.  It is especially delightful for me when the author mentions some seemingly small detail in the early stages of the story that turns out to be key later on. This book has an abundance of such treats. While the characters are not exactly heart-warming, they are fleshed out enough to draw the reader in. And the mood of the story is such that you simply have to know what it is all leading up to. So the suspense element was successful.<br /><br />Complaints are minimal. At times the pacing was a bit jagged - there were a few areas in the novel where the momentum notably lagged and removed me from the reading experience (namely the beginning of the novel and the start of Book III, to give a couple of specific examples). Often a chapter would open in such a way that the reader cannot be sure who the players are and that is jarring/confusing. And then for me the ending, although jaw-dropping, was just a teensy bit of a stretch. It's like everything just fell TOO perfectly into place, to the point of really straining at the seams of credibility.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Alex was a thoroughly enjoyable read with plenty of shockers and surprises that you never see coming. Despite the problems I had with certain slow spots throughout the novel, it still held my interest and kept me engaged and intrigued. Yes, it was graphic and intense, but that's one of things I liked about it. Boldness appeals to me.<br /><br />Enthusiastically recommended.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Colin Firth?  What could possibly be wrong with that?  We watched in in 2 days, the CD's were in great shape and we plan on watching again and again over the years.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Loads of action and special effects. Gwenyth was great. She even got her fight on! Robert was his usual great self. Don was very good, too. It kept you guessing through the whole movie. If you like allot of action; this is the movie for you. Make the popcorn first, you won't want to get up during.....
B003D81NVQ|5.0|Breaking Bad is the best series ever made for TV. I'm hooked and can't stop watching. Made it through two seasons in two days. I'm glued to my TV set.
B009MO57H6|4.0|Good movie...but only because I love the franchise.  It could have been better.  Of course, it will be hard to beat the first movie in the series.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|I thought this app was expensive for what it does. However, I needed the  ability to highlight and add notes to books and this does the job, once you figure it out. Not very user friendly as far as adjusting settings since there is little to no explanation of what the changes will do. I like that it automatically opens pdf files you download to your Kindle. The thumbnails are so tiny in bookshelf view that it's mostly a guess in opening the correct document. And it is slow, hence the four star review.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I bought this movie as a present for my dad and watched it for the first time.  He had told me it was a great show but I was surprised at just how good it was.  Hopefully they can get Cruise to make a few more.
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|downloaded the free one and then liked it a lot...great game.. so I say why not buy this one for a buck... same freaking thing.. I'm just 1 less dollar away from retirement.haha
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited for this CRAZY game to come to my kindle. It finally came and my family has been paying ever since. Just as addictive as on my computer
0938045768|4.0|Australians will find this book a bit over-hyped but definitely worth close study. Building and stretching muscle, tendons and connective tissue at the same rate results in real practical strength without soreness. The exercises easily fit into a busy schedule and require minimal equipment. It will take patience and sticking to perfect exercise form. The progressive calisthenics approach will help older folks to build their lean muscle mass without injury which helps to maintain a good quality of life. Highly recommended.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the coolest game ever. I love love love love this game. It's really fun and not boring. I like to watch anime
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I missed the first episode and don't have cable so it was well worth it to pay for it plus I can watch it again any time I want.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I bought the others in the past and and i really want to see this one too.  Very funny like the others.  I recommanded to everyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun game but some of the rooms were too easy.  There are only 10 levels so there needs to be more soon.  This is quite a fun game on the more difficult levels.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|GREAT AS ALWAYS.  GET VERY LITTLE DONE BUT READING ONCE I BEGIN ONE OF THE JACK REACHER SERIES.  ALMOST HATE TO SEE THEM END
B00DAXXO98|5.0|What fantastic acting.  Kevin Spacing out did himself in this show. I could actually believe he was the Speaker of the House.  I can't wait until the next season is available.
B008OOYALE|1.0|When you just get this game and if you are poor and you delete this game and then you get it right back you are still poor
B008OW1S3O|5.0|I liked it the first time I heard it, but that can often be a bad thing-- like eating too much chocolate as a kid and the next thing you know you're puking in the heat register. But this album just gets better and better. He has a great but different voice, and the variety from hook-laden song to hook-laden song is mesmerizing. Buy it immediately.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I enjoyed this book-- the characters were excellent- I love the ending also--<br /><br />  This was a great book and I read it while on vacation
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a fun hidden object adventure-type game. Interesting enough story line, lots of tasks to keep you busy. No need to spend money to keep playing.

B0041D843M|5.0|Here you will find empirical evidence that a Vegan diet is the best way to protect your health and also the health of our nation. I just wish President Obama had read this before he started his ill-fated Obamacare.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I couldn't contain my excitement when I opened the Appstore and saw this. They finally have it on Amazon! I've tried all of the other match-three candy games,but not one of them compare to the real Candy Crush. I'm usually not even a match-three game type of person,but Candy Crush Saga has me hooked. It's addicting and fun and the graphics are so cute. So,get this before they raise the price or change their minds about it. Now,I'm not the only one who doesn't have the app. Even my English teacher plays it! We all love it!
B000LXQVA4|3.0|I want to be clear that this isn't about the product but the way Amazon dealt with my problem. I just became a great grandmother.  I, from the reviews, decided to send this item.  Unfortunately it was sold out.  The web site advised me to ORDER NOW and they would ship it when available.  So I put it into my cart noticing that the item had jumped from $85 to $99.99. In looking at it I noticed that is was from a different company and was available. I didn't want to pay the extra cost. I took the time to speak to an Amazon representative and she advised me that you cannot hold an item.  What confused me was Amazon told me to order ASAP and it would be sent when it came in.  This was totally incorrect.<br /><br />I am saddened that Amazon is becoming  sloppy on their web site.  They couldn't tell me when the item would come in.  Obviously Amazon wants me to buy the more expensive one.  Yup I am angry but I wanted to share this with other customers that purchase from Amazon.<br /><br />In addition while I have your attention I have learned that Amazon now charges a re-stocking FEE in addition to the return postage.  I sent two items back.  One was defective and one because I didn't like.  I expected to pay the postage for the one I didn't like.  I got hit with a re-stocking fee for the defective and other item.  So anyone reading this, be very careful in your returns. Call them first to get them to tell you what will happen, the return charges and then have them follow up with an email to confirm what they said.<br /><br />I never did get the product and had to order a different type. I have been a loyal Amazon customer for years.  These last few months have been very discouraging as I feel Amazon isn't taking care of customers as they used to.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|John petrucci sounds great! Drummer is good but the drums sound way too weak in mix and tone is too flat for Dream Theaters sound. But overall very good . Way better than Dramatic Turn of Events.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The most moving book I have read in I can't remember how long.<br />So painful to read yet so beautiful and at times so incredibly laugh out loud funny.<br />I will hold the characters of Augustus and Hazel in my heart possibly forever.<br />I will hold my own children and cherish them.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Here's the thing I love a good app this pro's : good calculator , no ads ,and it is good for school cons : it doesn't have Pi good app.<br /><br />.
B00D2ZF24O|3.0|Jaden Smith is a good actor, but was incredibly annoying in this movie.....Also, how are dinosaurs and other long extinct animals suddenly back on earth, rampaging across the planet, after an environmental disasters, caused by humans, slightly more than one thousands years ago? This movie had some great action scenes and great special effects.  Could have been much better...but then, father son movies generally don't do well anyway.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I've been using this game about a week. I find it very fun, even for someone who usually doesn't play video games. I would recommend it for all ages.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game it is awesome!!!!  Easy to play and very addictive!!!love love love love love love please put up more free popular games like apple
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was my first book by Liane Moriarty ... and it did not disappoint. It was a fun read with many twists along the way. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone. I am now reading another of her books, &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; which is also entertaining.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love that this book had its own story but went back to bring in pieces of The Shining.  It kept me interested the whole time.  I would definitely recommend.
B005FRF6PC|5.0|Rafa is a great tennis player and a great person! His book is a must read for any tennis enthusiast. I enjoyed reading how he prepared for matches and about his relationship with this family. Stardom has not corrupted him! Rafa is an inspiration on and off the court!
B007EC27QM|5.0|It is very easy to read, I use it on a Nexus 7 and it works beautifully. The keys are huge so it's easy to read at a distance.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Really fun to play! A lot like subway surfer but more fun in my opinion. The upadates are really cool too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to see can finally play on kindle, have been waiting along time.  It's easy but wished lives could be earned instead of waiting.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Good show! Was intense from the very beginning and kept us on our seats the whole time! Wouldn't recommend this for little kids thought.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was a great romantic book. I would suggest this to anyone who loves romantic books. It would be a great gift for your reading friends.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Every bit as addictive as the original.  Depth of characters and story line kept me hooked every page! Some of his last works have been good, but seemed to lack Stephen's drive and soul.  This is the old Stephen at his best!
1878424319|5.0|It is a quick read.<br />It puts your life in order one step at a time.<br />Going to give it to my 14 year old granddaughter.<br />It will put her in a great place knowing the answers to life questions.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|It was an amazing book. I bawled the whole time but still wow. Just amazing. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I extremely recommend this game to let time go by and to just have fun! The music is perfect to set the mood, and it the game play is terrific. Best way to have fun.<br />This deserves s way more attention then it already has!
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|Blue Ray did justice to this film! The original DVD was well done and the Blue Ray is better.<br />I am a Scots History Researcher, having my family originate in the Scottish Borders Region; and William Wallace having been a cousin to my Ancestor, Sir Roger Kirkpatrick of Closeburn.  Mel Gibson did a superb job in this historical novel action-adventure, even if he did not have the large build that Wallace exhibited, he carried the part off very well.<br />The story diverged from history in the way Sir Robert Brus (Bruce) was portrayed.  What was missing was the battle of Stirling Bridge, a major battle for Wallace that rallied the people (if not the nobles) solidly behind him.  The portrayal of the Battle of Bannockburn was no where near the truth, and why they had to change that aspect of history is a mystery, as it was better than what was done here.  I know this was a movie about Wallace, so they wanted the Bannockburn cry to be for Wallace, but that is so untrue.<br />Would I recommend this movie?  Yes, and have many times to all of my family and friends, Even with it's glaring historical mistakes, it is one of the best, a true historical classic!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Fun upbeat series with a lot of humor. Great SciFi story line. Feels like a mix of NCIS and X-Files. &#34; I have two ideas about this murder. It could be DNA sequencing.... &#34; What was your second thought.&#34; Lemon meringue pie&#34;
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|The brutality and the unimaginable wealth of the Mexican Drug Cartels is over-played in this film for the returning &#34;Ahhnold&#34;...<br />It is perhaps one of the better 'returns' that could have been planned for Schwarzenegger. Playing a remote border Sheriff in Texas who just wanted to be left alone. Then, perhaps because of the remote location, the Mexican Drug Cartel's escaping leader decides to invade the self-induced exile to the nether-regions of the Texas borders.<br />The story is believable to most of America that has not experienced the NEW border crossings of USA-MEXICO. The Sheriff is bigger than life itself, enduring unending tortuous pain to rise up victorious.<br />Good acting (sometimes stretched) combined with unbelievable gun battles where the strength of the Texas Cars are shown to be better than anything Detroit built, delivers all the action that you will need.  Do I recommend it? Yes, if for nothing else, the fantasy action-drama that it provides; an escape from the troubles of our own times.  Add it to your collection!

B00C2IPB66|4.0|I had the original DVD release of this movie that did not have real quality playback. So, when the Blue Ray (second generation) version  of the movie was released, I bought it. It IS BETTER than the original DVD version, but not anything to write home about...<br />Would I recommend it to others, yeah, it is a good rendition and worthy of your collection.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I love the author's writing style. One of the lines stuck in my mind is &#34;the fingers of her soul touched the book.&#34;  It is so hard sometimes to read about what humans have done to each other....I cried a lot in the last 100 pages. There are many books written about World War II. I've only read a few from a German perspective. It is very well written.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I normally do not watch &#34;weird&#34; shows and this one is very weird. Unusual circumstance started me, but after one season I was hooked and the show reached its heights in seasons 2-4. There is much more intelligent, adult stuff going on beyond the obvious weirdness: humor in abundance, great attention to detail, excellent photography, editing, and music that is very intelligently chosen or written. The acting is first rate. There are a few major themes in the show and I will not ruin it for you by listing them. Discover them for yourself.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|My husband actually read this book and made the comment that it was ok, not great.  He felt the story dragged on a little too long.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so addicted to Candy Crush it was killing my phone.... Thank you for making it available to the Kindle Fire store!!
B001FQFFMG|3.0|This movie was great in that it told the story well with great actors and great emotion and attention to detail.<br />The reason for my reduced rating, is actually because of Cash's life itself. Johnny made a lot of poor choices.  I knew that before I saw the movie, but I didn't understand the extent of those choices.  Unfortunately knowing the details about those choices makes the man less likable.  For this reason, you may want to think twice before watching the movie.  Don't get me wrong, his songs, talent, and his passion are still significant.  It's just that maybe we all don't need to know about all his struggles.  After all we have our own to worry about.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is so close to happening IRL that reading it is a bit unsettling I am reading it again already
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show might be the best show I've ever watched. It's smart, the story grips you and it's also funny! The writing and plot is so good! A must watch starting with season 1. I've never ever given a review for a show before but then again I've never been hooked on a show like this before!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|These little minions are quite entertaining. Game is challenging and fun. This is a great game for adults an  kids alike.
B007704HO6|4.0|quite interesting read considering it is not much of an eventful story. gave quite an insight of somebody's life at the bottom of the ladder and how dependent James and Bob became of each other. Yes, I liked it and will probably read his other books.
B002BWCJOA|5.0|I love this movie. The music is amazing. There are so many cool hidden things in it. I also like it, because the more you watch it the more you enjoy it.
B00E1SJDSW|5.0|First there is his intoxicating baratone voice, then apart from past recordings that were very stripped down, here he's added a few other instruments not seen before, (flute, additional guitar, congas, organ, etc...) this all works very well here.<br /><br />On &#34;Spring&#34;, we're transported back to Laurel Canyon of the 60's, and some psychadelia thrown in for GOOD measure. It doesn't end there.....<br /><br />This, my friends, gets my nomination for album of the year!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's addicting.  Great game. By far my favorite free game.  I can't put down my kindle so exciting getting to the next level.
B0054JELS4|5.0|MUCH INTRIGUE AND MANY CASES SOLVED.  TERRIFIC COMRADESHIP AND MARVELOUS WORKING TOGETHER;  ALMOST, UNBELIEVABLE BUT OKAY AND NOT TOO FAR FETCHED.

B00CHS31DG|5.0|[[ASIN:B00CHS31DG Ghost Radar®: CONNECT]] I was confused at first. Then a great person gave me advice to follow, and also directed me to the maker's website. Now I love this app! It has so much stuff to perform. It is amazing. You can record your session, take a picture and see if you found something, send your findings to facebook or twitter. There are different settings that you can use to personalize to your specific wants. It is great.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|That says it best.  The main plot revolves around a point of view that through sacrifice, hard work, science, and a little luck, mankind will survive because it does adapt to the moment so well.  I'm glad to have seen the movie.  To really &#34;feel&#34; the movie, you have to have theater quality sound system with huge Woofers to feel the hits and high horn tweeters to hear the metal screeching on your nerves.  Kudos to the sound men for giving me that experience every time I watch it.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|I probably would have just given this DVD a &#34;3&#34; (Okay but not great), but I have the 3D version, and 3D adds a higher dimension to the film; I'm happy to have it in my 3D library.  The story is entertaining, but the lead actor who played Jack seemed very detached and out-of-place in this role; he radiates a &#34;what am I doing here&#34; and I could not identify with him; see if you feel the same way. The film might be a little too scary for young children.  Once again, the 3D alone is worth purchasing this film and the story-line is good.
B005PK553C|5.0|Very scary, interesting and great acting. I loved every minute of this show, and will watch it again in the future!!!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I have no doubt this is a very close adaption of the way it works in Washington, DC. Politics is a terrible business to be in if you actually care about other people. The corruption, especially in the current administration, will not get you into heaven without a LOT of repentance spent over many years and this show tells it all. The names and stories vary in real life but the end result is the same: You end up despising a lot of folks you are forced to work with and this show demonstrates very well the LUST for power definitely brings out the WORST in humanity! Great series!
1476727651|5.0|I love Stephen King, how his mind works, and the art he creates..This was such a GREAT read..I just wish I didn't have to work sometimes, but I did get through this book in under a week...So GOOD...I love what this man does to my mind...LOVE IT!!
1476727651|5.0|I loved this book.. It was a page turner and I didnt wanna put it down.. BRAVO Stephen King !!! I loved reading the Shininnig and Doctor Sleep didnt let me down !
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Do not get this app! It loads very slowly I had to wait a day to get it to load! Don't get it! =(
B004EPZ06G|5.0|I just love this movie!! Freakin hilarious. It came in the mail super fast, in perfect condition and ready to watch! Do not watch it if you're easily offended.<br />Buy it!
B0091TGWYE|4.0|It is okay. The strap does not pullmy phone out.  If it did this would be a 5 star rating.
B00DOPEGAS|1.0|My 7 year old daughter has this loom and the Rainbow Loom (received one of each as birthday presents from her friends.)  The Rainbow Loom is 1000% better.  Rubber bands are constantly falling off the Cra Z Loom due to the peg design (no lip on the top all around to hold them in place).  Skip yourself and your child the grief and frustration and just buy the Rainbow Loom (which is completely awesome).
B00ESNE696|5.0|another great season of amazing drama and controversy, lawyers verse's lawyers and friend aginst friends forced to choose sides and its riveting to watch!!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Started this book because I heard they were making a movie and I always like to read the book first.  I am not a hardcore science fiction reader but this had me from the first chapter.  The way Dashner describes the glade and all that happens in it makes it easy to become intrigued.  Will definitely be reading the entire series.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|another great season, hope they never cancel it, it could go on and on forever and i will always buy the seasons, amazing amazing amazing!
B002VHI8FE|5.0|**SPOILERS**I enjoyed it very much. I love introductions. I really appreciated the fact that the whole book is intended to introduce the characters and the newly formed journey party. It's very nice to have such good background of the characters.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Thank you John Grisham for a return to what you do best! After a few lack luster novels, The Litigators is a refreshing new take on Grisham's famed “under dog meets big law firm and ultimately triumphs\\" theme, and delivers a big shot of humour and irony in the process. Bravo John Grisham! I had avoided your latest books for many years,  but I am back again!
B00FEHXISA|5.0|This was one amazing movie im glad we watched it.  I will but on blue ray. Can't wait to purchase
B00D48BT5A|3.0|After looking forward to my next Bryson read - a big disappointment. What's happened to his sense of humour? Facts reasonably interesting by so blandly portrayed
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is breath taking! You get everything that you could possibly ask for! Air strikes, drones, recon, CTF, and much more! Connecting online is fast and easy, you will move through the ranks real fast. This game is not one where you have to invest real money into it to get all the good weapons. If you are looking for a very addicting game that you can get lost into for hours upon hours and that also feels like a console game rather than a app game than MC4 is for you! Very addicting...
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like this game because I like dragons. Also because their are cool dragons to breed. my favorite dragon is the firestorm dragon.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|I have always been a fan if period English films .I love the costumes and the country setting . I could watch this over and over.
B00AFEY354|5.0|A great movie (and book). The story is a coming of age story. I don't think it right to tell more than a very basic description and to say that I love this film.
1608871827|5.0|This book is full of behind-the-scenes stuff and had numerous inserts with extra goodies.  Illustrations are clear and sharp.  I could have done with more preproduction artwork but even at that there's plenty to like in this volume.  Excellent companion piece to the movie.
B005V20JKI|1.0|This game was one of my absolute favorites for android, so worth the money. I beat it a long while back but decided to play it again because it was so fun. Come to find out, the last update locked up levels and characters that I had already unlocked, and expects me to pay another $2 to access them! That is a joke! I've already paid for the game, why should I have to give more money for something I already had!
B006PKV2QU|5.0|Really greAt short story for the kids. They really enjoyed it. My son can almost read it all by himself.
B00C2UUPQA|4.0|This book is fairly well written, and it has a lot of new information about an amazing man whom little has been written about. A lot of unknown pieces about Bushell's life are filled in. This book is not an in-depth look at the Great Escape (although that is an important part), but it focuses on Bushell's entire life: his genius and his recklessness! A good read.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Back to his original writing style that I loved so much. And what a treat to revisit with the original characters. Great read! Great job.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so happy I can play on my kindle fire now have been waiting on this for months thanks millions. this is awesome
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game....is amazing! finally i dont have to wait for the app anymore. i can play it whenever i want. its so easy and i love playing with my friends
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|awesome game for people of all ages. great graphics and fun play. easy to learn and full of directions. which I love.
B008Y5UADK|1.0|No character development. Manic and poorly developed theme. High contrast black and white burned a hole in my brain. Missed opportunity to be an interesting film.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I usually do not invest in movies but I had to have game of thrones!  When my husband and I decided to watch the game of thrones again we decided to buy and are not disappointed!
B00EAIMGDW|2.0|This is a very fun, and clever game, except that it crashes constantly.  Would possibly give 5 stars, if it didn't freeze in the middle of every other level.<br />Oh Rovio, wherefore art thou Rovio?
B007SVPZMW|4.0|I like Tic Tac Toe as a fun way to kill time.. this game is not for my grandson (2 years old) but really close to getting it... The game could be a little harder to win but then I am pretty good at this game... LOL
B00F91RYL8|4.0|After all, its a Zombie movie.  How serious can it be?  Having said that, it was fun to watch, and suspenseful at times.
B00FPH6PRK|5.0|This is one of the best I've seen in a long time.  Full of suspense and startles. I absolutely love this movie. Don't let your kids watch it and don't watch this one alone in the dark.
B000JLTRIQ|5.0|Video arrived within a week, was as described, and had no problems playing in the DVD player thing a ma gig.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen Kings writing style has matured with him.  While there's plenty of &#34;horror&#34; in this sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;, it's his characterizations and insight into our &#34;humaness&#34; that really make his more recent works (including this one) so wonderfully entertaining!  Thanks to Stephen King for giving me my favorite books for the last four decades!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is addicting and it stresses me out, but in a fun way. This game is awesome and I recommend it.
1433502410|5.0|If you prefer ESV and are looking for an in depth study Bible, this is definitely it.  The study notes, diagrams, and charts are very thorough.  It is the most helpful study Bible I've had so far.  Just realize it's big and heavy.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I bought these Sony headphones to complement a pair of Sennheiser HD 280's in my home recording studio. I've been using the Sennheisers for nearly seven years.<br /><br />The first thing I notice is that the Sonys are much more comfortable; they don't squeeze in on my head like the Sennheisers do. The extent to which someone else would notice this difference likely depends on the shape and size of their head, but I suspect the Sonys would be more comfortable for most people.<br /><br />The sound of the Sonys isn't a world apart from the Sennheisers. Doing an A/B comparison, one right after the other, I can definitely hear a difference, but after listening for a couple of minutes to one pair or the other, I would have a hard time claiming that one sounds \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\".<br /><br />I do notice that the Sonys seem to somehow flatten and reveal more details of the sound. It's easier to pick out specific instruments / voices / effects from a song mix. The Sennheisers seem to gel everything together better. This might make the Sonys less preferable for general music listening, but more preferable for musical analysis.<br /><br />Other reviews speak critically of the durability of the ear pads. In my one hour of using the headphones, I haven't experienced this, but I don't doubt it's true. I plan to get a higher quality replacement pad whenever these start to disintegrate. (On that note, the pads on my Sennheiser HD 280's are still quite intact after years of usage.)
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Pearl jam has always had a song or two that would strike my fancy, but this is the first album I've put on and enjoyed from beginning to end. And it is so late in their career that it's a nice surprise. Glad they are able to stick together and still make good music.
6305428042|5.0|One word, CLASSIC! Watching this movie is a tradition for our family on Halloween! Our family cannot go one Halloween without watching this movie!<br /><br />It's the perfect movie if you're looking for a family-rated Halloween-themed movie, with comedy and with a just a little bit of spookiness to it.<br /><br />The storyline is great, it makes complete sense to why Witches are witches, to live off of children!<br /><br />I guarantee, if Bette Midler wasn't in this film, it could have been a flop. Bette Midler makes this movie! She plays the perfect Witch! I like how Bette, or known as Winifred takes things seriously and Sarah Jessica Parker (Sarah) and Kathy Najimy (Mary) are the goofy witches who are the opposite of Winifred. These witches are the perfect interpretation of what Witches would be like in real life!<br /><br />I haven't seen this air much on TV the last few years, which is a shame, so it's A MUST to own it on DVD!<br /><br />If you're looking for the perfect Halloween movie for the family, this is it!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Held me rapt right up to the end! Mystery with a romantic flavor...the relationships between family and friends interestingly intertwined! I loved this read...
B00AJLHUA8|2.0|You know the catch phrase, \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover?\\" It's the vice versa for me. I've never seen or heard of this movie before, and just by the cover, it looks very scary and it could be an interesting movie to watch.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was a waste of time.<br /><br />The only reason why it is considered a horror movie is because of the blood and gore. It has very sick and twisted murders shown in it, it's more disgusting rather than scary.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br /><br />What bothers me the most and why I rate this film so low, is that major parts of the story makes no sense. The movie doesn't show any connections between the characters. There is no connection or story to what makes the house they lived in be chained to all the past murders. I was almost completely lost by the end of the movie.<br /><br />I don't know if I'll ever watch this movie again. A waste of time, and I was just... lost!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game!!!!! It took a long time to get it on my kindle, but now that I have it I see what all the hype was about. I'm quickly falling in love, now if you can fix pet rescue saga for the kindle I'll be satisfied!!!!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love love love this book! After reading 50 shades and the Crossfire series, this book was a nice change of pace, but still such an intriguing love story with characters you can't help but fall in love with. I couldn't put it down and I'm REALLY hoping it gets made into a movie!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|wow I've been trying to get this app on the kindle fire for a long time a nd now you do
B0018OFN1S|5.0|Fantastically modern in its multi-cultural clan/cast and its transitions, all the basics of the series are laid out here as we meet the Toretto family & friends, as well as our good-hearted, love-struck cop O'Brien (Paul Walker) in the underground street racing scene in Los Angeles. The music, the look of the film, the portrayals, even 12 years (and 5 sequels, with a 6th being filmed now) later, this film looks, sounds and feels like something entirely new: an arch-type for the 21st century enfolds through the course of this exciting, entertaining film. Vin Diesel quite rightly became a star with this film: he holds and propels the story to a whole other level. A triumph.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love the series and very happy I finally got to catch up! Surprising ending to a great season for sure!
1593974760|2.0|Ok. Not as good as ender's game. Too many character threads. Reminded me of watership down. Glad I got it as a gift.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have had this game on my desk top computer for a long time and can easily get lost in it. Now I can take it with me when I have to wait appointments,etc.
B00E2B3TSS|5.0|I mean, is there any way this wouldn't be a 5 star release? Yes: most Clash fans already have these tracks, but to have them compiled and remastered (which I think sounds great for the most part) is perfect. I'll hold on to my original pressings and not re-purchase the remastered albums, but as a collection this can't be beat<br />and I'm glad I instantly pulled the trigger. Perfect for both long-standing fans and newbies looking to get acquainted with the greatness that is The Clash.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Good characters  plot makes  you realize that such a scam could fool  a lot of people.Loved the book,plan to get more of this writers' work.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank y'all so much for putting game on here for Kindle fires and I really do love playing this game!!:)
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love the books I have bought,I plan to continue to buy in future. It is great to just click wait for download to complete rather than going out to book store .
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|The DVD is people. The box is people. Everything is people. Hannibal the cannibal reigns supreme in my heart ~
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Dec love and will keep playing. Must have hope they will keep it coming but love the game.... keep them coming will refer to other friends indeed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome I've been waiting for this game to hit the kindle for ages wish there was another way to earn lives though I use to make fun of my friends playing and now I can't stop.
B00BC0PEEY|3.0|Sneakers is a great film starring Robert Redford. It sports an impressive cast and it's about computer crime and international espionage. Although it was released in 1992, Sneakers still holds up surprisingly well as a lighthearted thriller. The real problem is that the picture and audio quality are fairly average. The film could use a good remastering. The old bonus features (commentary, documentary, trailer) have *not* been ported over from the 2004 Collector's Edition DVD. Keep in mind you have to import this Universal Pictures UK Blu-ray so ensure you have compatible equipment for US players if you decide to purchase it. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star release.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/VC-1   Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio: English (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1), Japanese (DTS 5.1), French (DTS 2.0), Italian (DTS 2.0), German (DTS 2.0), Spanish (DTS 2.0), Portuguese (DTS 2.0)<br />Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, German, Italian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Hungarian, Korean, Mandarin, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Swedish, Thai, Turkish
B002B0NAV8|5.0|I always been a fan and always love there music since I was 13 years old and There BAD ASS
B000X2H8G4|1.0|I am surprised that so many people liked this product. The enhancement is slight to nonexistent and there is a lot of  background noise. I'll never use it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its kind of hard to stop playin its just so fun! Everyone should get this game. So they can becone addicted like us.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Shows you everything at a glance.  I would prefer a little more separation between the hours and minutes (a colon?) but that is really minor.
0451531051|5.0|I absolutely loved it! I bought it used and it was in the best condition possible! I love this book so much.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|The musical numbers are terrific and often very funny. Steve Martin and Bill Murray together in the dentist office is the comedy highlight.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again a very enjoyable read from Stephen King. There is something about his writing that keeps me coming back for more and Doctor Sleep does not disappoint.  I very nearly took a vacation day just so I could finish this book.  I have to say that The Shining is not in my top five list of King works (and is in fact one of a few of his books that I have not reread), but Doctor Sleep took what I liked about The Shining and expanded on it while some of what I didn't like about The Shining was minimized.  If you like Stephen King you will like this book!
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|If you thought Stalone mailed it in, Karl Urban wasn't even there (as far as I could tell) in this re-visitation of the Judge Dredd character. Olivia Thirlby was cute as the Pyschi Rookie Dredd is evaluating as a future Judge. The Director and Special Effects people should be &#34;judged&#34; for their efforts - the &#34;Slo-Mo&#34; drug scenes make us wish the drug has been &#34;Fast-Mo&#34; to get us out of this, and the psychic scenes with Anderson (Thirlby) went from reasonable to unicorn rainbows and back.<br /><br />If you like automatic weapons, gun fire, graphic death scenes with lots of blood, Dredd meets your needs. If you are looking for Doctor McCoy from Urban, watch Start Trek again. I can barely remember if he ever took off the helmet (mask). The other characters will be lucky if their names are removed from the credits, so that they can get work in the future.
1934137197|2.0|It seems difficult to see how this book beat out the competition for the Pulitzer Prize, considering it's merely more than a novella and lacks in plot (a dying man spinning memories in his head). Some nice moments of prose, but a similar amount of over-writing for art's sake, which apparently some critics admire. I loved about twenty pages of this book.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|A good book. Sort of a different take on the TV show &#34;Heroes&#34;. An interesting voice for the protagonist. Will be interesting to see if the character continues to develop, or if the story devolves as more books are released.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive game! Real fun! I have seen so many people who play this game! We play,our kids,,family,friends......You get mad but still play! Lol.......
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|... what was left on the cutting room floor.  Certainly little in this documentary, as fine as it is, paints the band's leaders in a particularly good light.  Glenn Frey comes across as such a self-serving, arrogant SOB that it amazes me that the Eagles managed to stay together for nine MINUTES, let alone nine years.  As you listen to him, it becomes clear that he was responsible for each of the splits (first the beer incident that led to Bernie Leadon's resignation, then the badgering and goading that led to Randy Meisner's, and finally the under-handed business dealings and posturing that led to Don Felder's audit of the Eagles' books and his ultimate firing from the band).    Don Henley comes across as a driven perfectionist, but so heavy-handed that anyone who stood in his way - even Frey, his staunchest ally - got bulldozed.  Joe Walsh looks as if he's choosing his words VERY carefully, as if making sure that nothing he says offends Massas Glenn and Don.  He wants to keep his job, after all.  Timothy B. Schmit, likable as he is, offers little of value.  At least the exiles - Leadon, Meisner, and a surprisingly emotional yet un-bitter Felder - are allowed to contribute to the story.  The audio of the 1980 onstage fight between Frey and Felder alone makes this set a must-own - as does Randy Meisner's soaring performance of &#34;Take It To The Limit&#34; on the 1977 concert disk.  I'd like to think that the Eagles were about the music - that's what I, at least, would prefer to remember them by.  And oh, what music it was...
B00F3WO0NS|4.0|I cannot describe why I find the show entertaining, but I do. I follow the series from its first airing pound because DirecTV is no longer broadcasting the station, the only way I can continue to follow is here on Amazon. Bonus, no commercials!
B00DW1WR14|3.0|5 stars because this is a Pearl Jam album. 3 stars because I have heard it all before. PJ is showing their age and have settled into a comfortable predictable existence. I am surprised how many say that PJ is stretching out and their style is evolving yet most reviewers site each song as sounding like a song on past PJ albums. To me this is a problem. Did Quadrophenia sound like Tommy or Who's next for that matter? NO. They were unique works of art as was Dark Side of the Moon to Wish You Were Here to The Wall. PJ's last decade of work is interchangeable, mundane, and predictable. I still like it because I am a fan, but the catalog is not strengthened by this entry. The one song many reviewers site as being a great song and one of the albums best in Infallible- to me this is PJ doing their best Maroon 5 imitation (if you don't believe me, listen again with an open mind) just as Dirty Frank was PJ doing their take on the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The artwork of the preacher at the pulpit in front of the dunce cap wearing congregation (of 2) is PJ's commentary on religion but ironically it is Eddie Vedder in front of mindless PJ followers who love everything they put out. I think a true sign that this is less than a classic (as some call it) is I don't see anyone ever covering anything on this (or anything in the last decade for that matter) as a tribute to its greatness.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I wish I learned more about the English monarchy back in the day when I was in school. I may not have been interested back then but I am now. Learning more about these events and a possible storyline, fictional I'm sure, does make it entertaining. What more can I ask from a TV series?
B008Y212PI|3.0|Got this as a FAOTD. I really like it and would give it four stars EXCEPT for the frustration of hitting the wrong button because they are too close together. Seems like there is plenty of room to move one button to the left of the screen and one to the right so it's harder to just mess up your whole game. I have had to restart many times because of this and it's getting very aggravating.  Got your ears open Dev's? I also think this one is better suited to a tablet rather than a phone.
B00ARN0YDS|3.0|PA4 kept me at the edge of my seat<br />But disappointed that there wasn't much scare. Great addition to the franchise but not the same level of fear as the others.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Love Love Love the candy crush saga I think it is the best game ever created and I definetly recommend this game to well...anyone!
1401201911|4.0|I enjoyed Red Son very much, though it wasn't quite what I was expecting. It is, of course, an alternate history that posits the intriguing question, &#34;what if Superman had landed in the USSR instead of Smallville?&#34; The aspect I didn't expect was the inclusion of other D.C. heroes such as Batman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern. In one way, I thought it got a little crowded, losing some focus on the story of Superman himself. I would have enjoyed seeing more of how Superman dealt with his powers as a kid in Ukraine and then his entry into Moscow. Instead, we got an interesting Batman origin story and a glimpse into the lives of other characters in this alternate Earth.<br /><br />The story settled in, with some excellent ideas and gorgeous artwork to match (I adore this Superman's emblem!). But it's the final act that makes this graphic novel such a knockout. I won't reveal a spoiler here. I'll just say that it's clever, surprising, and totally worth the price of admission.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|the game is fun and it seems to be working well but you only have a small number of plays then you have to wait to get more unless you are willing to pay for more it also incourages payments for other things to &quot;help&quot; you do better
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This app appears very simple at first but it is crazy addictive. I downloaded it for my daughter but quickly found myself doing it too and laughing my head off. The guy with the piranas was hilarious. A fun little time waster, especially considering its free.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|The script was good.  The magic, the twists were all great. I like how they deceive the wealthy man in on of their shows.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I was so happy to see this available on AMAZON and I had not been able to download it from any other APP.  THanks for making this available!! The program has everything that I need to locate Scriptures fast.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|It was not what I  expected it to be. Actors were good. I did like the fighting scene on the mountains that was pretty interesting and would like to know where it was shot if it wasn't indoors.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's like Bejeweled on a sugar rush! Fun times glad it's on Kindle Fire now. You won't be disappointed, unless you lose all your lives.
B005VZQ95O|5.0|Love this album it has a great sound to it. Pink Floyd always had great music so if you want a great album this is the one to get.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I've love everything I've read by these two, writing together or separately. And the Pendergast books are by far the beat
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a very simple time passer type game. Didn't find it challenging at all and figured the whole 10 levels out in less than 30 minutes. Please add more rooms with a bit more challenge. And there are no hints..which I love because at the very moment I couldn't figure something out I would be using a hint
B008J34466|5.0|I love Pink, but this was just ok for me. Need to listen to a bit more, cause for me it grows on me the more I listen to it. Arrived quickly, would use this vendor again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i have been trying to find this app for my kindle now for months and its free and it works.i have no complaits about this candy crush saga game. get this app today.love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy this came out for the Kindle Fire! Works smoothly, graphics are great also! Highly addictive! Thank you for making it available!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Great game.  Good concentration skills and I love the audio and graphics.  It feels like I'm playing real golf but not out in the hot sun or adding to my back pains. I love it!
B002VECM72|5.0|My wife and I just love this movie.  It is a great story based in fact.<br />More people should have an outlook on life similar to this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love the game it's so fun that I'll play it all day long and I'll never ever stop playing untill I'm dead because it's so fun and very good so that's why I love this game and I will play it forever
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|1.it has exclusive towers<br />2.less lag than on computer<br />3.you'r.couch can once again be your friend<br />4.but better than call of duty(no joke)
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Its not War and Peace, but its no accident this movie was number one at the box office. We saw it in 2D, Real 3D, and IMAX 3d plus the 3D Blue Ray came with our 60&#34; Panasonic plasma for free. This is our loaner disc. Great pace, breathtaking vistas, heavy metal weapons of war and so much attention to detail we continue to watch it several times a year and never tire of it. Created from its inception for 3D, and a labour of love, no doubt, my only complaint is I would have preferred  more +Z or off the screen &#34;in your face&#34; from Cameron. IMAX does 3D best, but we have other movies where there is more than mere &#34;depth&#34; being the benefit of 3D. When you feel you can reach out  and touch components of the movie, like foliage, etc., 3D becomes the knew paradigm: TOTAL IMMERSION! I have about thirty 3D titles and very few delivered this extra dimension and I'm losing interest in paying so much extra for so little more.
B002HSSAY6|1.0|I tried watching this movie but the reception was so bad I had to turn it off. It would run for a minute or to and then stop. Restarted it several times. No improvement. If this is what you get with Amazon Prime, its worth less. Finally turned it off and went to Netflix.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minion rush is a very fun entertaining game that you could play for a while expesially if you are bored.
B00383ZTXO|4.0|I love this album by Iggy Pop I have seen him a few times live in Detroit many years ago. It was nice to get this 2 CD albums at a nice price. Thank You philboatbike
B007EC27QM|2.0|I don't know where they got all those starys from. I suppose old people like this, they don't know any better.
B001MSMULG|5.0|Loved the twists and turns. Loved the characters. Loved the various settings. It was a great read and kept you involved until the end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that candy crush is available and free on top of that. I never played it anymore because I hardly get on my laptop anymore. And since I have downloaded it to my kindle fire I have been playing non stop!! I wish I could get all of Facebook games on here!!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Love that I can see the suits of all the cards, the auto-play feature, the stats info after each game.  So worth the $ .99 to avoid the ads, especially when you think how many hours of fun you'll have in the months to  come.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Great game in the vein of sonic the hedgehog, but with a cute theme. I'm having a blast with it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Considering that this was a free game it was fun and enjoyable. Not that difficult to complete. Go ahead try it.
B00004WEJZ|5.0|A Great Sean Connery Bond Movie , and  was At A great price , in great shape . Great place to do buisness .
B009NX1YT6|5.0|Olivia Newton John....what more can I say?This is possibly the most fun you will have watching an awesome sing along movie!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Okay so thus book starts out and your following it thinking one thing.. Then you go through a whole gamut of emotions. You go from fighting for Nick ( the husband), to stop making stupid mistakes cause you want everyone to like you.. To feeling sorry for him.. To being really pissed at him to trying to figure out okay.. What's really going on here... Then you get Amy's side (wife) who is certifiably crazy!! INSANE!<br />I don't know how Gillian Flynn came up with this story or the concept of how deeply troubled people can be and how twisted stories get we all become puppets in someone's sick world or fantasy.. But this was a food read. I couldn't put  the book down I had to find out what happened to Amy and how this whole mystery of her disappearance was going to play out! I couldn't stunt Amy throughout the novel I thought that she was selfish, childish and stupid.. A product of her genius parents who made her a real life cartoon character in a book maybe but at the same time she knew right from wrong, she knew what she was doing... I did not give this 5 stars because of the end.. I didn't like it.. But it was an end and not every book is going to have a happily ever after, a there you go crime is completely solved and all is out, sometimes you have the reality of what can actually happen in these stories.. this is our boom club book this month and I can't wait to discuss it.. Enjoy the ride I did..!
B008Y212PI|4.0|I enjoy thinking logically in order to solve this type of puzzle. I liked having hints when needed and being able to make mistakes and still continue until it is solved.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|What a lazy piece of filmmaking this is. A story that could have been written by a sixth grader (as long as his vocabulary consisted mostly of a four-letter beginning with \\"f\\"). It's supposed to be in a post-apocalyptic future, but other than the weapons, there is nothing remotely futuristic about it. People are using iPhones and wearing contemporary clothes, for crying out loud. It's a fairly low-budget film, but imagination doesn't cost anything, and there's no excuse for such sloppiness. This isn't a movie; it's just product, aimed at gamers, phoned in by hacks, and ground out to scrape a few more bucks out of an audience. Save your time and your money, and watch something else.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful, suspense, page turner. Beautifully written, with deep understanding of the human condition. Is my favorite book by far, this year.
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|Amazing cable. 10ft made the difference. It works great and charges the phone without any issues. Highly recommended to everybody.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use it in my phone and kindle and it works great.  I would love to see more opportunities to get points.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|But I love Connie Britton. And this had me (chicken that I am) firmly on the edge of my seat. Jessica Lange is amazingly creepy. Overall, highly recommended.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great I really loved it, can not wait to see what happens next thumbs up loved it nice awesome. Great
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Best thing ever. Great picture. Can view it pretty much on all devices. Don't have DVD laying around collecting dust. And a few dollars less
B00006AW63|2.0|I have to send it back because it doesn't read in my DVD player it says region error, definitely not what expected.
B00F35BV64|2.0|Was very dissappointed in watching this movie.<br /><br />The movie is completely out of line with the other Star Trek series and movies.<br />Young Spock in this movie is showing a lot of emotion and in the original series he is not.<br />Young Captain Kirk can not bring out the character as the original one which was played by Shandler.<br />Also the Klingons on this movie look completely different then the Klingons in the series as well as<br />other movies.<br /><br />Spock gets launched inside of a volcano by cable instead of that normally people are beamed.<br />So do the Klingons. They also get lauched by Cable down from their space ships only to see later in the movie<br />that by some miracle the teleporter works and ppl seem to be able to get beamed back and forward.<br /><br />Alot of inconsistencies in this movie made me almost not wanna continue watching it.<br /><br />Special Effects are awesome, but the story line very weak and the actors should be replaced with another<br />set of actors as well as who ever directed this movie was definately not a follower of Star Trek the series<br />as too many details are not the same.<br /><br />I will definately not reccommend to watch this in the cinema.<br /><br />A shame as the Star Trek brand I am a huge fan of and to see this new set of actors and director take the brand down.
B001NLKT60|2.0|Intrigue and character development good.  But way too much detail into &#34;history&#34;.<br />And sex is over the top.  Way too much.....is this the only way to deal with stress?<br />It perhaps gives you some light on the weakness in the characters, but why is it necessary?<br />The author must be obsessed.......<br />I would not recommend this book.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Was disappointed in watching this movie.<br /><br />This movie is really about Will Smiths son who he wants to launch as an actor and<br />the kid has to learn still a lot in acting and should not have this kind of lead role as<br />he was not able to pull off the character.<br /><br />A lot of inconsistencies in this movie. The acting was not very good.<br /><br />Will Smith you really do not see much of in this movie. He is just telling his son what to do<br />and the movie is focused on what his son does.<br /><br />His son changes from being scared in the whole movie to a split second into a somebody who is<br />not scared anymore. Very strange to see that happening and not very believable and of course<br />this alway's happens at the very end in which he saves the day.<br /><br />The kid was supposed to have had a lot of training in which he had to do a final test exam inwhich he failed.<br />During this movie he only behaves as a soldier who just started to get training. A not very believable character.<br /><br />Also I was very surprised to see the acting of Will Smith.<br />No expression of emotions in this face.<br />Looked more like somebody just reading the lines of a script.<br /><br />Special effects were very good, but the story line was very weak and deserves more for a video game.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|I love the two actors in this movie and thought it turned out really well!  Cute chick flick, would recommend for anyone looking for a heartfelt comedy romance.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Super slow for me in the beginning but I came back to it a couple weeks later and could not put down. Great book and looking forward to the rest.
B0028INIWE|4.0|I'm not one of the Deads' digest fans, but there.is a few songs cause there were a few songs I didn't have.<br />Truckin' brings back some good ol' high school memories. That shows my age. Songs sound fine,  for being older recordings. I was happy with my purchase.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Was happy with app until I purchased a bundle for $4.99 that was advertised between puzzles, after going back to my puzzle library I noticed they were not there, checked my bank account and I was charged! Do not purchase on this app!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Although I am not finished with this book yet, I will give it a rating thus far.  I am enjoying it mostly because it looks back at the events of &#34;The Shining.&#34;  It is keeping me interested, but it is a bit slow out of the gates. It is not one of those that &#34;I can't put down.&#34;  In fact, I put it down for a couple days and read a little and put it down and read a little. I hope it picks up. But being a bug Stephen King fan, I will not pass total judgment until the end. He usually does not disappoint.
B0014YVCDK|5.0|Binaural is Pearl Jam's best album.  This album is designed to be listened to with headphones, and it's the most enjoyable way to experience the album.<br />Light Years, Of the Girl, Sleight of Hand, Nothing as it Seems, Grievance, Insignificance, and Parting Ways are some of the best songs ever written.<br /><br />I listen to Light Years, and it's truly incredible how beautiful this song is.... It's a song that should be played on the radio constantly - and the fact that it isn't, is one of the reasons I don't bother to listen to the radio anymore.<br /><br />You'll hear mixed reviews about this album.... It's true, a lot of PJ fans rank Binaural on the bottom of the list of Pearl Jam's albums.  I think this is a mistake.  Binaural is a gem, it's a jewel of music - a diamond in the ruff.  It's one of the best albums of the past 20 years, and one of the best albums ever made.  I don't believe any Pearl Jam album has aged as well as Binaural, and it seems to become more of a classic with each passing year.<br /><br />I think Pearl Jam's first 5 albums are all classic... But Binaural is when Pearl Jam hit their absolute peak.  It's when they reached the very height of their songwriting talent.  Never have they sounded so artful, and creative, and musically huge as they do on this album<br /><br />I think Binaural takes patience.  As some of the best albums do... But the patience is worth it.  This album will always have a deep place in my heart.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|OK, so enough has been said about the film...it does what it says on the tin: giant robots beat the crap out of giant aliens from another dimension. I'm here to talk about the 3D release, which, unsurprisingly, met and surpassed my expectations. CGI tends to be a natural fit for 3D, and considering pretty much every set piece fight in the film (which, as I mentioned, is why you're watching this thing in the first place) is CGI. In between the fight scenes, the 3D doesn't add much - pretty standard &#34;blurred background with popped out actor&#34; shots driving the dialogue-based scenes, which is good, but doesn't add much. The fight scenes are another story. First, the shots of the command center and pre-fight &#34;suiting up&#34; are unexpectedly awesome - the futuristic instrument panels in the command center really add to the near-future high tech setting as they float in midair. There's been a lot of noise around the decision to set the big scenes at night in the rain, and again, the 3D is a natural fit here - the separation of the rain and environmental effects from the kaiju/jaegers and backdrop makes the scenes easier to follow visually. They also did a great job with 3D and sense of scale - rather than making it seem like you're watching a diorama, the 3D actually made the scenes more immersive, making my display seem bigger than it actually was.<br /><br />This is 3D done right - I'd go so far as to say it could change some minds about home 3D. If you want to show off your setup, this is pretty much THE film to get.
B006BQM762|1.0|I did not enjoy this movie. Sorry this movie is your standard Spielberg, if you've seen one you have seen all.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Phenomenally good, as expected. I love this show.  I was shocked at the ending!  Can't wait for January to watch next season
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Excellent book, well written. I enjoyed the way the writer involved the main characters into the history of that time.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I don't ordinarily watch horror any more but got pulled into this by my friend. It isn't for kids, for sure, but it is unbelievably well done. Jessica Lange is impeccably evil throughout,
1451688091|5.0|Gave this as a gift, and the person really enjoyed the book. I recommend this book highly for your own reading pleasure or for a gift.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I had not seen this movie when I purchased it on the recommendation of my brother.  I was certainly not disappointed.  This was a real surprise in the theaters too (so I've heard).  Truly enjoyed it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Never heard of the show before I started to just sample the pilot. The acting, writing and photography is top notch. I love this show. Amazing shows on TV are very rare. This blows most shows away with the innovation and character interactions.<br /><br />Kudos girls and guys.<br />Thank you<br />Rob Kutch<br />RenovatingYourMind.com
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just when you think you know how things are going to end bam they send you flying into another direction. Although grim  the story is beautiful in its own way. You definitely don't want to miss out on this one.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|this app was a good app but when I tried to purchase something it just froze. thats why I only rated it three stars.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Another five star album from onerepublic. If you enjoy their previous records you will love this too. Classic onerepublic but just different enough to make you stop and listen. I've enjoyed every track - love them all!
B000000OMP|5.0|WOW!!! This is a great HEAVY LOVE METAL album!!!! A collection of huge hits like SLOW AN EASY, GAMBLER, ALL OR NOTHING, SLIDE IT IN, GIVE ME MORE TIME and the classic LOVE AIN´T NO STRANGER!!!!! GREAT ALBUM!!!! WELL DONE, WHITESNAKE!!!!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|M h criticising service ratio servicE service driver driver concert what driving schmucks Scottish defends Schubert Richard church screw set-up success
B0002NRQTS|5.0|Presto is a great album from the Canadian Rock Metal legend Rush.....Rush´s career is incredibly solid, filled with great albums, but Power Windows(1985) and Hold your Fire(1987) are BY FAR their most Pop, full of keyboards and their less inspired songs......Presto is a return to a more Rock oriented Rush, with pearls like The Pass, Scars, Show don´t tell, Chain Lightning and Available Light!!!! Their 70´s stuff are something apart, but Presto is one of Rush´s greatest moments after Moving Pictures(1981).....
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This stupid app will not open. If anyone has any suggestions, I am listening.  I tried to uninstall it and then reinstall it, but it would not uninstall.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|THE DIVISION BELL is one of the BEST albums from the legendary PINK FLOYD....You can´t compare it with past masterpieces like DARK SIDE and ANIMALS, because there´s no Roger Waters on DIVISION BELL....David Gilmour did a great work leading FLOYD here....Great songs like MAROONED, WHAT DO YOU WANT FRO ME, TAKE IT BACK and HIGH HOPES....WELL DONE, PINK FLOYD!!!!!!!!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I'm going to love it for now even tho I'm not very impressed but I am hopping it takes a turn for the best. They can start by letting me come on the showas darryls wife he thought died :-)

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love candy crush even though I just found it on kindle I have complaints. Thank you for putting this app on.
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|Was totally lost trying to read this book.  I am agnostic, but this book did not make any sense to me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for the family to play and teaches responsibility to younger people and gives them an idea of taking care of a pet.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|Gravitational force, tangential velocity, and inward acceleration aside, Gravity was the perfect film to get the gears for geeks like my friend and I, a photographer and a geochemist, rolling with its phenomenal views of earth from space, intricate and elaborate details of the insides of space crafts, heart-wrenching portrayal of the struggles with loss, solitude, and despair of the main character, and the amazing attention to details that make the film almost believable in the problem the plot presents to her. In the end, we were left asking as we wandered out of Ward Theater in Honolulu, Hawaii, could this happen in real life? (A discussion to be had over a couple of beers and a sandwich at Big City Diner - for sure!)<br /><br />The intensity of Sandra Bullock's performance as the main character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is incisive. There are several moments throughout the film where the deep emptiness, loneliness, cold, and despondency that can be found in space (and that was promised in the movie trailer) really hits home. It's gut and heart-wrenching, and for those moments, even this slightly clinical observer was left with a tear in her eye. George Clooney, as Matt Kowalsky, played nicely off of the character of Dr. Stone. His is a charismatic character that appeals to the hard-worker in me - the resentful one that has yet to achieve something of greatness but is ready to be done.<br /><br />Add to this great acting and desperation that the plot introduces, fantastic visions of the earth and its atmosphere as viewed from outer space, and what we have is a chilling interpretation of what it is like to be completely abandoned by hope and embraced by futility in an environment that is a paradise the character cannot enjoy.<br /><br />This was an amazing film - the best I've seen in months. I highly recommend it... Oh, and see the 3d version! It's an uncanny experience.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|The free version is short but entertaining. It took me awhile to figure out that I could touch the inventory item and then touch where I wanted to use it. I was dragging things and it would allow that, but when I got the item to the right place, it would not work. Touch-touch was better. I was kind of lost and then found the little footprint icon that would put a footprint where I could go. But there are places you can click for clues that do not have a footprint. For example, if I am in the courtyard, I will see three footprint icons for places to go, but I can also click on the well, for example, and make progress there. The lack of hidden objects is GREAT. I am not a fan - personal preference. The mini-games are ok, but not the best. One said to rotate circular disks to unscramble a picture and I had the picture clearly in place, but nothing happened. So I backed out and in again. Ack! Had to start again. But this time it gave me an item when the game was unscrambled. I tend to think that some games (not just this one) have mini-games that are impossible but after a while the game just rotates into place and you win. Like the rotating disks again. I have four dials to touch and rotate five disks. But one disk will not rotate in increments to line up. So I click one that is already in place, which of course makes it out of place again but also moves another. I am perhaps not smart enough to see the pattern and after a while the game feels sorry for me and makes a picture and it all lines up.  OK, maybe it does not feel sorry for me, but a timer inside it says &#34;enough!  End it!&#34; Anyway, when I got to the part that said &#34;unlock&#34; for a fee, I was not enthralled enough to pay. It was mildly entertaining, but not enough to pay, for me. There is a good hint button, and you can zoom in and out. Some items in the inventory need to be combined to be used. Again, entertaining, but not enough for me to pay to continue. BUT it was borderline! Maybe I will later decided to reload and unlock.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love Swiftkey, unbelievable intuition.  The more you text the more Swiftkey adapts to your style of texting.  I love the enlarged keyboard and the ability to change colors of the keyboard.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of the best &quot;run&quot; games I've played. And the movie tie-in just adds to the fun! I love the variety of the unlockable areas and villains to defeat.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read The Shining when it first came out and re-read it a<br />few years ago.  I've seen the movie many times also.<br />Stephen King did not like the movie as directed by<br />Stanley Kubrick and has made it known that Dr. Sleep<br />is a sequel to the book, not the movie.  I enjoyed<br />Dr. Sleep very much and it kept me turning pages<br />into the early morning hours.  I loved the characters<br />and actually felt sad when I finished the book and<br />had to say goodbye to them.  As a longtime King fan<br />since his first book, Carrie, I've always appreciated<br />King's character development in his books.  This is so<br />important to each story and makes a difference between<br />an OK book and a great book.  Thanks, Uncle Stevie,<br />for another fantastic book!  Is a Dr. Sleep movie on the<br />horizon?  I hope so only if King has a direct involvement<br />so Hollywood doesn't ruin the story.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I understand that Google will be adding feature and things to it, cool.  Still wish there was still something more amazing that what it is.  Great gadget, I like that I can check out my youtube clips on a big screen but still wish it was just more.  Hard to explain.  I don't regret buying it, just wish there was more even though I know it's kinda new and it will improve.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The Top Dog...the epic matching game that gets everyone in trouble for playing instead of doing what we should be doing!!  Truth is...I love this game. Lots of levels.  Clear objectives.  Easy enough to progress, but enough challenges to keep you wanting to succeed.  AND HUGE EXCITEMENT for those of us that have been waiting for this app to be available on the Kindle Fire!  I use a stylus to target my matches cleanly.  Great game.  Very addicting.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Wow... Godzilla is still out there... Or maybe someone opened the bottomless pit... Very little to enjoy about this movie but I did get a good nap.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addicting resulting in warm batteries that need recharging every couple of hours. Having slight problem with lag in Halloween residential with banana splitter
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It's a neat app, but it has to be plugged in and on all night to be usable at the time I'd like an alarm to go off!  Perhaps it would be more usable as a travel alarm clock.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It needs an update, so that we can actually use the TNT on creative mode other than that I really like this Pocket Edition!
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|Absolutely loved this. Every episode is so enthralling and suspenseful. Hugh and Mads were excellent. Every scene is so masterfully calculated and Will Graham's POV is an exceptional view point into the life of Hannibal
B002X6PTH8|4.0|Just a fun goofey movie. A few bad words but a pretty good family movie. And Cameron Diaz is well. Wow.
B0063M22QO|5.0|my little girl loves this game, we have to take turns playing the game.  It has helped her learn the differs in shades, also in counting . We have a good time with the game.  thank u and met up the good work

B008IBPMZG|5.0|This season is a great sophomore one...the characters have gotten more confident in their characters, and the writers are writing for them as well.  No big surprises, but a great season
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|This book is a wonderful representation of a beautiful ideal. Take from it what you will, but here is what I got from it.  All over the world are billions of people. New York, contains so many different people with different cultures, religions and ethnicities, all living together and working together. Everyday these people are living their lives, just like you and me. Our struggles may not all be the same, but they may not be all that different either. The person driving in the car next to you or passing you on the street is living a life just as real as your own. This book and the blog before it gave me a glimpse into so many people's lives and reminded me, to not dismiss anyone because their joys, struggles and pain are just as important as my own.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This season is the best so far, DA just keeps getting better and better.  There is more real life issues and outcomes, which for those of us a little more mature realize this is what happens when life happens.  Very emotional, very good, Surprising and thrilling and satisfying all at the same time.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|Buy it! For me, this one of those albums that I just kept on repeat for countless weeks. Great hooks, wonderfully atmospheric, lovely vocals. In sum, buy it!
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|The cd was in wonderful condition & we really enjoyed watching it. Wanted to share this with my child who was not alive when it originally came out.  Thank you.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I'm addicted to this show.  Hoping Season Five is available soon. Please make it available on Amazon Prime! Thank you much.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Beautiful, a truly great game! - We need to get an XBOX version!!! - Also more releases for 2015 2016 2017 2018 - Glu just needs to keep them coming!
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|I found this book fascinating because I love to watch TED.com videos. This book has lots of great suggestions on how to put together a top-notch speech, and it provides detailed explanations of the rationale behind each piece of advice. Next time I need to speak to a group, I will definitely pull out this book and read it again!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Oh wow. I adored this book. I liked it so much, I've read it three times already, lol. It has been a long while since I actually lost myself in a book--got so caught up with the characters--that I forgot I had a house to clean, dinner to cook, etc, etc. But my chores were put on the back burner while reading Forever Girl.<br />*Stands up and claps* Bravo, Rebecca Hamilton. Bravo.
B008Y212PI|5.0|FlipPix Art is fun.  Some of the pictures are very easy, yet others are very challenging.  You work at your own pace and you can make up to 3 mistakes before needing to restart.  I find it a relaxing to complete a few pictures after a rough day at work!!
B0012NO316|5.0|This film is so great. It is very well-acted, funny, and interesting to watch. Based on Edward Albee's amazing play, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton give tour de force performances in the roles of Martha and George.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easy download. You have multiple options you can play with and videos to look at. You can add multiple cities to a list and see weather conditions all over the world. This site DOES NOT have a GPS tracker that will drain your battery. This one is looking even better by the day as I use it.
031623480X|3.0|Good info here, but he skims too quickly over the deeper science.  If you already know about excess carbs, it's a bit disappointing.  If you're new, this will be just fine.  Listen to my Interview with Dr. P. on my Primal Diet - Modern Health podcast on iTunes for more.  I challeneg him on a few points.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|An excellent account of the history of Jesus's time and the creation of odeon Christianity. This book is very engaging.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad it's finally on Amazon, so I'm not 120% using my phone for candy crush. The game is bomb.com!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've finally downloaded this game and its very addictive. Very colorful and clear. Yes I highly recommend this game to anyone. Keep up the good work!
B00000269M|5.0|When this album was originally released in 1987 the Hype was through the Roof. Bad Was No Thriller but was a Huge Record in it's own right. I originally had this on cassette and eventually purchased the CD. Depending upon your preference You may want to make your choice carefully when purchasing this CD. If You want the Original Mixes of Some of the Singles from this album buy the earliest issued version you can find. The one I purchased was from Japan. It Contains The Spoken Word Intro To I Just Can't Stop Loving You  and The Horns mix of Bad. Different Pressings aside the Music is the work of a Genius. If it's not in your collection put it in your collection.
B00BHMEALA|2.0|This movie is predictable from beginning to end. It pretends to be a thriller, and I was tricked by the good reviews and awards that it was worth watching. I remember watching &#34;The Jackal&#34; about the assassination attempt of Charles De Gaulle, and feeling equally empty. Whenever a movie attempts to create a thriller about events already played, the result is a shell of events that cannot be convincing towards whatever theme intended. We already know the outcome, so why are the creators pretending to surprise us? How harrowing can known events be? I think a more creative way of designing this movie would be to re-design it like a documentary, almost like an ongoing news cast with the events and players being swept up in the timeline. This movie was just plain anemic. I suppose if you're a really dumb, uninformed and manipulable person, your brain might be slightly charged, and if so, then I blame you for providing inspiration for those who made this piece of crap. And I blame myself for buying into it.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This app is over simple to use. My five year old brother can use it to tell what the temp and weather outside is. Yet, it is also very amazing because it does tell the temp and weather and doesn't require internet access.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Was bought like additional tool for the Darex Wskts Knife & Tool Sharpener Knife Sharpener. It smaller, lighter and can be used for temporary sharpening for knifes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been looking for this game for my kindle tablet, now I have found it. Its so much fun I have played this game before and I love it. Now only if they could put pet rescue saga on here I would be even more happy! :D
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This story was interesting to read and I did enjoy it. But the whole story was missing a certain element to make it more believable, and it also left a lot of questions unanswered at the end. The story didn't seem to accomplish much and I felt a great sense of dissatisfaction at the end.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is an awesome game for practicing how to draw and it could also be really funny!! I would reccomend this game for awesome artists! :)
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|James Taylor is such a talented musician.  That's what I like about him.  He can take a classic Christmas tune and put a whole new twist on it so that it sounds unlike anything you've ever heard done with the song before!  I own tons of Christmas albums and I've heard some of the tunes done the same way by every recording artists for decades.  But this album is like a breath of fresh air, snow laden holiday air, that is.  It is only October and I'm already listening to it.....repeatedly.  this is my new favorite album by James Taylor.  I love his soft, down home voice anyway.  Pairing it with Christmas tunes seems a no-brainer.  Trust me, if you like James Taylor you will LOVE this album!
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Badass freaking album. I got it used and honestly it looked brand new. No scratches no nothing just a badass album.
B00C8RBTEY|5.0|I just watched Warhorse, One of the best horse movies I ever saw and a shining example of the legacy between Horse and humanity. We owe horses more than we could ever give. exellent service also
B00ENTDDGW|2.0|I like the game but I will only give it 2 stars because you can only play on single player mode.
B00F35B8F8|1.0|I am rating the Star Trek Into Darkness HD as a one star for video quality. I believe it was not pure [[ASIN:B00F35B8F8 Star Trek Into Darkness [HD]]]HD, but 3D. As such the images were of particularly poor quality. It would have been essential to know that before renting the video! The non-HD product was probably much better and a dollar cheaper. Renters should be warned if the video is 3D and not HD. By the way, I have a wonderful, clear HD picture on my new LCD TV for other HD movies.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Super clever variations on the many regular bubble game apps.  Like a grown up disaster to regular bubble games. Time limits are imposed unless complete goals and or buy more credits.
1401917232|4.0|The third book in a series by Gary Renard once again features his two spiritual master teachers, Arten and Pursah.<br /><br />Gary Renards books focuses on The Course of Miracles and his learning experiences in life studying and teaching the course and the wise teachings of the Ascended Masters, Arten and Pursah.<br /><br />This book pertains and encourages forgiveness and by the time the reader gets to the end of the book they should understand that of true forgiveness is the key to all perceived problems.<br /><br />The subject matter dealing with what happens to individuals after death are discussed by Arten and Pursah and examples of the practice of forgiving are given in real experiences by the author.<br /><br />Gary Renard frequently uses portion of Course of Miracles to reinforce the intent of depending on the Holy Spirit to make our decisions and see this world through the eyes of our true spiritual selves and recognizing illusions we once felt were reality. Suggestions of depending on the Holy Spirit to not become attached to the physical world we have placed ourselves in while not feel guilty over enjoying the day to day pleasures while on the road to enlightenment are also explained in this book.<br /><br />Gary Renard has written two other books named The Disappearance of the Universe and Your Immortal Reality are the first two books of this trilogy and I would recommend reading those two first before purchasing this book so the reader may become accustomed to the history or the contents. If you are thinking about delving into reading Course of Miracles then I would recommend reading Gary's first book of Disappearance of the Universe which would give a more stable foundation of understanding `The Course'.<br /><br />There were portions of this book I really enjoyed, some that I had a hard time wrapping my head around and some that I felt drug a little bit in reference to my interests. If you have read the other two books then I suggest buying this bookto complete the set and read the new thoughts expressed. I was given the opportunity to read this book because I review books for Hayhouse and choose this one to give an honest review.
B008ROG6E0|5.0|This movie really holds up so much better than I ever imagined it would have. The rating is misleading as there are several nude scenes in the movie that I had forgotten about when I watched it with my little kids the other night. The only part that doesn't hold up are the shots from outside the city. Here, the models really look just like models. Also the big shots from within the city it looks like models as well. But, they were very few and I found even my eight year old and his buddy stayed engaged in this movie. Loved it. And I think it is cool many parts were shot in Dallas and Fort Worth.
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|This girls is a star in my book. Cant believe she isnt getting more hype cuz this album is actually dope. and she's only ;like what 16 going on 17. Both her vocals and subject matter are WAY beyond her years.
B009ZQFSRA|1.0|This film obviously attempts to create a Matrix/1984 hybrid and the end result is absolutely horrid. I am a fan of Christian Bale to an extent (American Psycho he was great) but all he does here is make Keanu's acting in the Matrix look good. How do you review a film that really offers nothing to review? You pass. 7.5/10 on IMDB makes me think I am living on the wrong planet. If you like American Psycho and Machinist Bale avoid... rather, RUN. However if you like cartoons and comic books enjoy. 50 minutes of my life is gone forever to this total garbage.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is finally on kindle fire!! I have been waiting for a while. Yay!! Thank you Amazon. You are starting to step up your game. :D
B005TBWN0K|4.0|Screen shot is good. I don't use Evernote anymore but recent app upgrade makes Skitch more versatile across other apps.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Good Forsyth as always.  Nothung more to say.<br />Kept me entertained and up most of the night.<br />Mucho buena read.<br />John
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great game and speed and patience are required. It would be better if crystals were easier to acquire. Some extra time would also help. A tutorial outlining the accumulation of coins, crystals, experience, etc. and the use of them would be a helpful addition as would be a drop down menu. The game can go on for days. Each day you can accumulate more energy and items to further your process. Be patience and keep your real money in your pocket. Have fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game love it got bored with it for about a week but I find myself playing it when I have time to kill so very entertaining . Koodos to the creators
B008MAI0WK|5.0|The Raspberry Pi is really a computer; that's designed to make it easy to learn to use programming language. to build various projects, and keep expenses down if you DO happen to do something wrong.  There are two reasons that this book is a great one to buy at the same time you buy your 'Pi.  The first is: .even if you buy your Raspberry Pi in a kit of some kind; there is very little in the line of instructions included with it.  The second is, given it is DESIGNED to be able to be &#34;manipulated&#34; (programmable), you need a guide to help you get the most out of it. Ebon Upton, one of the co-authors, is a trustee and Executive Director of the Raspberry Pi Foundation; who better to offer you advice on how to get the most out of it?  It is a smooth read; and it was a great help to me while I got up-to-speed on just how adaptable the 'Pi really is.
B009WUBERW|1.0|not a very good movie not what I expected not well acted the plot was non was terrible the story was to far fecthed
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I do love Fruit Drops,and this second version is even more interesting... it contains increasingly challenging levels and twists.<br />Fun and addictive!  No glitches, it works perfectly.
B003DS3GC0|3.0|for such a big cast ... why was the acting so TERRIBLE?!?!?!  ending was predictable and lame and the final scene with the characters at the kitchen table made me mad it was so cliche.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|i feel like i am hearing the voice of an old friend after years of being out of touch.  i want to read until i can't, then wake up and do it again...
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Loved this book, it can be read on its own or as a follow up from &#34;The Shining&#34;.<br />One of Stephen King's best writings, another &#34;IT&#34; or &#34;The Stand&#34;.<br />Gripping and full of action, I found this book very hard to put down.  Wanted to read on to see what happens but did not want to finish the story. Can also see a follow up is possible and even desirable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have a love/hate relationship with this game. very frustrating at times but I keep coming back. well played king, well played.
B00942Y35S|5.0|Penelope has been cursed from birth with pig-like facial features. To break the curse she must marry a &#34;blue blood&#34;, but once they see her in person they go running away squealing! The movie is like a modern fairy tale. Well acted and enjoyable to watch!  But rather than being about finding true love, it's more about Penelope finding out about her true spirit, through adventure and self confidence!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush!!!  I'm glad that I can finally play it on my kindle! Candy crush is my favorite game. It is addicting!
B000008HPE|5.0|Their early work was a little too 'new-wave' for my taste, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own - both commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humour. In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is 'Hip To Be Square', a song so catchy most people probably don't listen to the lyrics - but they should! Because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself!
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I am a Constant Reader, however, I was very disappointed in the book.  It seemed as though there was a lot of filler throughout the book.  I really had doubts while reading it, if Stephen King wrote the book entirely by himself.  Sorry!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great, can't stop playing.  I would recommend  it to all my friend because I know they will love it as much as I do.  Makes you use your brain and think hard.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This has been around for a while so glad it finally is on kindle. I have not been playing much because it was not on my kindle. Now I can get caught up.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is a heartwarming true tale and we all root for the author.  Good writer  - animal lovers and everyone else will love this one.
B009V3KKXY|4.0|GOOD BOOK. I recommend this book if you are new on paracord hobby. Pictures step by step. Fool proof. I'm getting the second version as soon as I can .
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this story! Mr. King told a great story and I hope more adventures for the  characters. Did not want it to end but it did because I could not stop reading. Love it, more, more, more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a very fun app espesaily the halloween one.this is a great app for people my age(9)<br />I love this app! !!!! wish could rate900000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&empty;000000000000000000 stars!!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like the game very much ,I don't like when it shut down just when you about to win .It shut down to often for my taste
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the sort of novel that you can't put down. The story is non-stop action that really does keep you focused the whole time. I have read all three of the books in this series and they maintain their quality.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|Awesome app I use it all the time u must get it . The creator of this app is a genius I am gonna tell all my friends buy it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that I was able to get Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle Fire. Thank you Amazon it was a long wait to finally be able to play this fun and addictive game. Now I will be waiting for Pet Rescue. The King games are great.
1863514260|5.0|Words cannot describe how wonderful this book is in helping with colour choices, and the best part is she tells you the colour numbers.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|It's a good book.  I don't want to right about why, I just want to give it a rating.  Amazon, why do you do this?
1863514201|5.0|this is a must have book for every embroidery library,step by step instructions, thread colors given by thread names and numbers. patterns provided
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|The whole family walked away happy and entertained after this one.  Animation was spectacular and comedy was spot on.  Daughter loved the little monkey &#34;Belt&#34;.
B00846REIS|5.0|Sylvia Day is one of the best romance writers there are.  I would like to have more of her books.  Love them.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great little puzzle game. Requires more thought and memory as you go. Rather short play time but highly enjoyable. Can't wait for more levels.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Once again a hit book with me.  She is awesome. She needs to have more books in a series like these 3.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I love Sherlock Holmes stories and would recommend it to everybody.  It's a great read and I think that all will enjoy it.
B006GLM5EQ|1.0|Loved the books. Love the author. Grossed out by the tv show. After 10 minutes on amazon instant view I was sick to my stomache.<br /><br />If you like paranormal try the Dresden series series on amazon instant view. I read all the books (in order) then found the tv series (drama, great characters and dry humor). More bang for your buck.<br />Toni
B00BGYNEMK|5.0|This book is something special! I can't put it down. Great great great, I wonder how many men read this? I can't wait to see the movie!
0316219266|5.0|I picked up several books at Costco.  I saw this book and had heard nothing about it.  I started to read it in the Pharmacy section at Costco, and found it fascinating.  I couldn't wait to get home to continue reading.<br /><br />And this, I have to tell you... I buy a lot of books and never get around to reading half of them.  This one, I read cover to cover and didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />I loved it.  Oh how I wish I worked at Barnes & Noble in Bellevue when they went to get their coffee, and I could have asked if they needed some help in the garage.
B00FPH6M82|5.0|This was a great movie don't why it got such bad reviews. Is it because there's no cursing, no nudity or sex scene, no buck dancing. Its a journey of a Son conquering his fears and short comings with the guidance of his Father. The Son saves himself his Father and.they go Home. I luv it. A true family Movie. Will and Jaden you did great.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is wonderful.  When I first heard about it I thought it was another trend book and that it wasn't worth my time.  Boy was I wrong !!! It is so worth it.  The lessons in this book are simple in nature but not so easy to follow but if you do, even if you just follow one, it will change your life.  I recommend.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Its a good Movie wish I had seen it in 3d. Puts you right into the action. The scale of these robots is amazing. The special effects are awesome!
B003A9SW4O|5.0|Super sad ending when Christine dies! The phantom and her should have gotten married and Meg should've died! So sad!
B003A166OK|4.0|I purchased the movies for rainy day entertainment.  Grandson likes the old westerns a little popcorn and we are good for the afternoon.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|His a great game although when u get high levels like73!!! It is very hard to do these levels without buying something it stinks .
1933952806|5.0|For me it is a next step in learning about possibilities of the camera. It is a great book to help me get information I need.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Entertaining and visual effects well done. Story line follows the novel to a degree. Overall the message of the novel communicated.
B00871C09S|2.0|but a little silly for nowadays, and that may not be a good depiction of our society in this day and time. I think Grace and James are great actors, though.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has done it again. I loved the idea and the plot. And, while I did see one of the twists coming, he still managed to catch me off-guard with a couple things. The action is great and I really like the characters.
B002BWP49M|4.0|In my opionon its a terrible movie, but my wife loves it.  The picture and audio is great and she loves behind the scenes that comes with it.
B0046179EO|4.0|Couple of great songs here: Baby Blue and Day after Day received big radio play back in the day.  You can hear the Beatles influence in several songs on this album.  Buy it for the big hits and enjoy discovering lesser known gems.
B006H5120E|5.0|Great quality and picture.  Made a great christmas gift with all the diffrent versions even though you really only need one.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Very nice movie. It's touch your heart<br />I saw this move few times but each time I see it I enjoyed
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|Awesome album. It's almost like a sex soundtrack.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Love this app. It is easy to navigate and gives pretty accurate info, I've checked it with local news weather and is pretty much on base.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Great movie! I've seen it 5 times Tom Hanks was really convincing. Loved it!  Fantastic! Inspirational, sad, funny, heartwarming. Yay
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Loved the book from beginning to end. Loved the movie too. Held my interest all the way though. More stories like this please.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|My mom always called me the weather girl.  I like having this on my Kindle Fire.When I use my Kindle I could see the temperature , and then I would know how to dress.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|I needed some new CD's for a road trip and she has always been a favorite.  This was a great double CD set to ad to the collection for some travelling tunes.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Action-packed from start to finish. There were a few twists and turns that made sense at the end. Nice finish to the trilogy, but can you say &#34;sequel&#34;?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|5 stars.  Hard to put down, just like it's hard to keep a secret.  Characters were solid and realistic.  Storyline moves steadily towards the inevitable climax.  I was glad to see the epilogue.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a blast and so much fun to play! I love it! =) all the levels are different so it never gets boring or stupid. Plus the minions are cute to watch. Get this game you won't be disappointed =)
B007T99ENE|5.0|Finally, McEwan is back - great prose, believable characters, and a nice surprise at the end. What a pleasure to read him!
B00280LYIM|5.0|Percy Jackson and the Olympians the battle of the labyrinth is the best book I ever read it inspired me to study Greek mythology.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|this story was a great, quick read. I loved Duncan's book, Gordonston Ladies' Dog Walking Club, a murder mystery set in a quiet neighborhood in Savannah, which led me to &#34;An Actor's Life&#34;.This short story was brilliantly written. The main character is very likable and the ending is perfect. I look forward to reading more books from this author.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This is a classic.<br />Lotta/Pesci/De Niro/Sorvino and Bracco are extremely brilliant in their role.  The cast is a real fit.<br /><br />I've seen the movies so many times now and they never stop amazing me.<br />Scorsese is a genius!
B00FEN1C50|1.0|Terrible acting. Illogical fight scenes. Too long. Awkward. It's very obvious the plot exists to carry the action. All three Transformer movies are better. The Transformer movies aren't good.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really enjoy playing the game. it is very addictive. I just wish you did not have to wait so long in between for your life to restart.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I have enjoyed this book.  If WW II interest you at all I would highly recommend this book.  Good story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game for &amp;#34;children&amp;#34; of all ages. It is challenging and fun. I love it and do do the grandchildren.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|It was an extreme pleasure to watch such an exciting, heart warming inspirational movie. I wish there were more movies like this one.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|With friends in many countries of different timezones, I can not only see the time it is there but weather and forecasts. Including my area and anywhere I travel to before I'm there with ease
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Add audio book support and be able to wake to as an alarm and you will have a have a winner.
B007EC27QM|4.0|App looks good on the S4 and seems to be much faster than some I have tried. Needs a 4x5 screen widget but it's good without.
B00985E3UG|4.0|This book is subtitled \\"How the Food Giants Hooked Us,\\" but it could have and perhaps should have been subtitled \\"Another Version of David Kessler's [[ASIN:1605294578 The End of Overeating: Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite]]\\"<br /><br />Author and New York Times reporter Michael Moss trods the same ground as former FDA Commissioner David Kessler did in \\"The End of Overeating,\\" which came out three years earlier.<br /><br />About the only thing differentiating the two books is Moss's fascinating interviews with former food-company executives who regret having devoted their careers to developing and peddling processed \\"food.\\"<br /><br />Other than that, if you've read one of the books, you've read the other.<br /><br />Both books provide a service to readers, insofar as it helps to know thy enemy. Once you become educated about the way Kellogg's, Coke, Kraft and other processed-food corporations are getting us hooked on unhealthy substances, you've started down the road of breaking your addiction to this crap.<br /><br />So by all means, read either Kessler or Moss.
B004JK61K0|4.0|My email icon for the Kindle Fire HD stopped working so needed to find something that works.  So far it has been very dependable and not too difficult to use.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I love this flash, much better than the built in one ! Twisting the head gives you different effects !
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game.  I have a hard time finding games I really can get into and enjoy.  I like that it has many levels and is a game that I wont finish in a day or two.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I love this series not only for Mr. Cumberbatch but  also for the  great writing for this modern Sherlock.  I wish this were a regular series.  5 stars plus.
B008JFUO72|5.0|If your an ironman fan,you must have this one in your collection,the best one yet ! You will not be disappointed.....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game and very addicting can't stop playing it. Finally I can play the game on my kindle. I have been trying to get this game on my kindle ever since I bought my kindle.
B008KWHKGM|5.0|Im a 43 year old dude and saw these guys on Jules Holland one night and have been digging them ever since. Saw them live at the Tower up in Philly and that only reinforced my opinion. This CD has several bonofied hits and the live disk highlights the previous release. This is one of the best albums released in the last 15 years in my opinion easily. These guys are that talented.
B00499QUK2|5.0|If you haven't seen this show you are missing the best cast, written and acted show on TV. Just can't wait for series 3!!
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|This novel kept me in a state of high anxiety turning the pages as quickly as I could. The little boy from The Shining has grown up  with  his extra 'talent' still intact. I'm always a little dubious about sequels since in many cases they're not as good as the initial book but this is powerful and gripping.
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|Game plays well. My little girl loves it. No noticeable glitches have been seen like I have on other sonic games.<br /><br />Glad to see sonic is still alive and doing well.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book is not for the faint at heart. A true story of human endurance against the odds of fanatical foes. Survival and sanity at its limit.A very compelling account of the battleground as witnessed by the author. Surprising personal confessions of the the soldiers stress under fire.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I think iron man is so cool it's a lot of fun for anyone who wants to find a good game I recommend it highly
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that this game is on here! It's challenging but fun. I'm enjoying it so much because now I can sit almost anywhere and play! Thank you for putting it up!
B003G4W49C|5.0|My daughter bought me this book saying it was one of her all time favorites.  Must agree!  Looking forward to the next.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Cool game but hate waiting on lives  but  it's  fun  and additive.  Whole family loves to play it. Fun fun
B00ENYCQX8|4.0|very good epub/pdf reader. any book you buy from the amazon shop can be set up in bookviser. even better it can bookmark page for later reading.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I hate writing reviews but man... I'm Very satisfied. Highly recommend this app. Best clock app out there! Great for nightshifters like me.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Enjoy this app even though you have to purchase most of the puzzles or to do larger piece count. Like that it can be done in  short amount of time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I wish they would open more levels on here and my phone. I am at the end so if I want to play other levels I have to get on the computer.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|It has great graphics filled with interesting objectives the keep you on your toes and leaves you glued to the game!
0307950654|3.0|Plot focused on Darcy and other characters... and not the arc of growth for Elizabeth as in Pride and Prejudice. Characters reasonably stayed true to Jane Austin's creations.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addictive and really makes you think. Great game that makes you want to keep playing. I would suggest it to anyone who likes to play puzzle games.
B00F880BWG|5.0|All I could hear was \\"The Weather Girls\\" singing, \\"It's raining Dead, OMG it's raining dead!\\" during the supermarket scavange. Hopefully someone will create that viral video.<br /><br />As a person who is a fan of all things Zombie, I have to say that this series only disappoints when it comes to its focus on the living and not the dead.  Understandably, it has its ups and downs; season 2 spent a lot of time out there on the farm up to the point it was starting to become a soap opera.  Having all that drama is great, but it's better when there are more dead around.<br /><br />The first episode of season 4 did not disappoint too much. There are zombies around every corner and the make-up artists have done an awesome job re-creating these shambling corpses. My only point of confusion was Rick's encounter in the woods, I think I understood what happened when the scene ended, but it didn't seem to flow with the episode.<br /><br />The scavanging scene at the supermarket should have actually been near the end of the episode.  An interesting ending which, by the way, ended on a very interesting cliff-hanger.  Hopefully they will elaborate more on how and why it ended like it did (no spoilers here).<br /><br />I still give it five stars, one of the best series ever to tackle the Zombie genre and do it very well.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I love this album!  I can really rock to it.  I love CCR!  It brings me back to part of my youth.  With this tablet I can listen to good music and do other stuff at the same time.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|In this classic horror movie, Regan McNeil is possessed by ole Lucifer himself.  This movie is based on some actual events and was adopted from the book of the same title by William Peter Blatty.  Starring Jason Miller, Linda Blair and Max Von Sydow this movie will scare the hell right out of you.  Now get your ass to church!
B003CNQPNS|5.0|It was exactly what I expected and will order again if ever possible played well and was sealed well thanks a lot and was a great price
6305882592|5.0|In this classic cult film Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon play an unlikely pair to fall in love but that's what happens.  Very very sweet movie with a killer soundtrack by Cat Stevens.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I like the original but I think this was a better take on it. You will not be disappointed. I am sure there will be a sequel. (At least that is my hope)
B002KJX4IE|5.0|You have to see it at least once before you die. It is an excellent cautionary tale of what could happen if you dont read your handbook for the recently deceased.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is a well done science fiction war novel. Yes, the story focuses more on the main character's training rather than than the war they want him to eventually win for them, but that doesn't make it any less a war story.<br /><br />It's easy to see why this story is so popular and also why it's stood the test of time. Through Ender's point of view, the author manages to capture just the kind of torture the military establishment puts him through. Because it's mostly a mental torture, much of the narration works to that advantage. The quick snippets of conversation between people in charge of training him breaks of the story nicely, giving you insight into their way of thinking but then see the immediate effects of how it hurts, pushes, or helps Ender.<br /><br />Good well written story. This will undoubtedly maintain its classic status among science fiction novels.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I purchased mine directly from Google... mistake...<br /><br />Setting it up didn't really work at all. I have all the requirements that it needed, but I could never get it passed the errors related to connecting to WiFi and UPNP.  The fact you can't get it to work around those issues is beyond me. I have a very expensive wireless router that could more than handle the needs of this device, but IT didn't think so.  Wouldn't let me continue with the setup... (I work with technology every day, and have worked in IT/ with computers and mobile devices for quite some time, so it's not incompetence).<br /><br />The setup is a pain! It's extremely finicky. Honestly if you need to display something on your TV from a laptop/desktop/or mobile device: buy an HDMI cable (they're super cheap on here)!<br /><br />When I tried sending it back to Google, they took almost 2 months to refund me, and they didn't even give me the entire amount back (sent it back in PERFECT condition).  Never buying another product of theirs...
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great fun and the RIO theme is hilarious. This is the best game to wait in line at the bank...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is fun , I do not like it when the horse has to rest every 5 minutes.  I love it though.

140006922X|1.0|Like others I was lead to believe (by the author himself) that this book would give us an objective view of Jesus, the man, based primarily on non-Biblical historical evidence (ancient texts, archeological evidence, etc.).  Perhaps Aslan would even introduce some recent historical discoveries that would blow our old theories about Jesus out of the water.  As it turns out, there are few non-Biblical sources referenced at all, and he resorts mainly to summarizing the findings / opinions of other writers (and selectively at that).<br /><br />In his defense (so to speak) he actually clues us in to this lack of extra-Biblical scholarship in his introduction where he writes, \\"The problem with pinning down the historical Jesus is that, outside of the New Testament, there is almost no trace of the man who would so permanently alter the course of human history.\\"  So then, where does one go from there?  Surprisingly, for Aslan it means spending most of his time combing through the gospels looking for specific topics relating to Jesus that he feels moved to pick apart, despite the fact that he bluntly states in his introduction, \\"the gospels are not, nor were they ever meant to be, a historical documentation of Jesus's life.\\"  And even in this arena there is nothing new under the sun.  He reopens tired old arguments about Jesus' birth, his purported divinity, his education level, etc. - all things we have heard before.  The end result of is a mix of his personal opinions and the opinions of others before him with no new perspectives and no conclusive evidence to support his opinions.<br /><br />What surprised me the most is the fact that this book can hardly be described as a scholarly work.  Any reader who has taken at least one college level history course will recognize the disparity between Aslan's fictionalized and dramatized accounts and those of a serious academic writer.  If you are writing a narrative biography about someone such as John Adams (e.g. in the style of David McCullough) you might more easily get away with this.  But when you are attempting to refute popularly held beliefs about someone like Jesus of Nazareth you need to provide substantial references utilizing footnotes and/or endnotes to prove your thesis (and his paltry notes at the end of the book do not cut it).  Yet this lack of specificity on his part may be directly related to his inflated impression of himself that is set forth in the \\"Author's Note\\" where he speaks of his \\"two decades of rigorous academic work\\" (did he not author at least four other unrelated books during this time period?), his \\"exhaustively detailed research\\", and his being an \\"inquisitive scholar.\\"  It seems that he just wants us to grasp the idea that he is smarter than we are and has spent a lot of time on the subject so we should just take him at his word and not ask for any textual or archeological evidence.<br /><br />Ultimately this book suffers from poor scholarship, a specific agenda on Aslan's part, or both.  I would suspect the latter as he constantly betrays his feelings by his use of derogatory language.  But to readers out there who consider themselves to be committed Christians I would point out that this book is as anti-Jewish as it is anti-Christian.  His condemnation of the temple practices during the second temple period and the priestly sects is a good example of this.  I was subsequently referred to a book entitled, [[ASIN:0830828443 In the Shadow of the Temple: Jewish Influences on Early Christianity]] by Oskar Skarsaune that seemed far more objective and continually referred to many non-Biblical sources (an easier read, too I might add).<br /><br />I really wish that I could say I learned something interesting from this book, but as it is impossible to discern historical facts from Aslan's fabrications and opinions, reading this was just a waste of my time.  In his \\"Author's Note\\" Aslan writes, \\"I angrily discarded my faith as if it were a costly forgery I was dupedinto buying.\\"  I know how he feels.  I want my $16 back!
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|A fantastic romantic comedy perfect for a holiday read. Don Tillman is such a well written character and had me in stitches. Loved it!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to be on my kindle fire for awhile now!  It is very addictive but also an enjoyable game the whole family can play.  Thanks again and now back to the game in progress.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|really like the show just want to keep watching  it really keeps you wondering what will happen on the show
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|I really loved this series and hated to see it end.  Speaking of which, I would have created a completely different ending, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen it.  The actors were outstanding, the special effects and story lines were terrific. I wish they would consider a sequel.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Awesome. I just love Bones. Can not say anything bad about this DVD. Can not wait to buy season 8 real soon. Thanks
B008XG1X18|5.0|I loooove it!!! Super fun and neat ideas, easy recipes and you can follow other people based on what you like even if you don't know them and it's FREE!!!!!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I think this game is awesome . I liked the movie also. The game plays verry well . I like the task and battle play.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|My grandson loved it,took him one evening to put it together, he is seven.Would recommend this game for proper age group.
B00E9E4EC8|3.0|I am a huge Alan Jackson fan owning most everything he has done.  Have been anticipating this cd since word got out a few years ago that he had asked Allison Krause to produce his bluegrass album but that produced the only cd that he has made that I don't like and it was a far cry from bluegrass, more of a lounge singer type album.<br /><br />I have been a bluegrass fan as long as I can remember.  So a combination of my favorite story teller and my favorite style of music seemed to good to be true.  Now don't get me wrong, I like this cd, but this is NOT bluegrass.  It is acoustic country with a banjo and dobro.  Blue Ridge Mountain song is my favorite on this cd and is as close as it gets to bluegrass but even that is NOT bluegrass.  Adding a banjo fiddle and dobro to a song does not make it bluegrass, it's a style that is very distinctive and this is not it. Never comes close to that 'high lonesome sound' of bluegrass.  It's a good country album done in the typical Alan Jackson story telling form.  I like it as a country album.
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|Each Trivium album has it's own character and identity, and fans have their own preference though you can't really please everyone. Ones that expected them to put another Ascendancy got The Crusade, and ones that even expected another Shogun got In Waves which ended up sounding closer to Ascendancy. For Vengeance Falls, there's a little bit for everyone. There's been a bit of controversy about them recording with David Draiman producing. Don't expect any Disturbed-style music here. This is 100% Trivium. In my opinion, Draiman likely pushed them to try a few different things, and it certainly works for the record. So, don't be deterred just because his name is attached to this.<br /><br />Please note that a deluxe edition is available, but it's likely an import or only available for download. However, there's a Best Buy exclusive that features two out the three bonus tracks featured.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is the bomb you should get more games just like it. go candy crush saga by king.com boo. ya
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|A very emotional movie, it was a really great movie I am so glad I watched it. I think Liam Neelson show have gotten an award for this movie too bad he didn't.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I like having this so I can read on my phone. Only problem, is that it freezes at times, or doesn't download all that I want. It has a limited amount of titles that it shows. Also, doesn't seem to update where I read it last with my other devices?<br /> Not sure why.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome and awesome and awesome again. My mom and sister have the game on their phones and I waited months for this game to com  out, and here it is
B004GJDQT8|4.0|It's convenient to have on my smartphone. Makes it easy to look up items and buy online when I don't have my computer or laptop near by.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Fun game for a,m,a,z,o,n k,I,n,d,l,e. I enjoy playing in spare time. Good dungeon crawler to pass time on a road trip or stuck in waiting are at Dr office. Free to play but you buying stuff will decrease the amount of time it takes to advance within the game. PvP is excellent, good way to earn currency gems. Fun game. :)
B00ENCFCMC|5.0|First off any review less then a 5 cant exist. A top tier show is one you want to revisit. One you will find yourself again watching in years to come. Have you seen the movie Gladiator. No doubt if you have seen it once you have seen it several times. Like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones and to a lesser extent Walking Dead this belongs in the Best Ever Category of shows. Imagine a longer version of the 300! I will watch this series again. Sad to see this triumph of Television end. The Action, Sex, Visual delights and Blood make you feel as though you are in Rome itself. It has many triumphant and sad moments. I truly dont even know how shows like Friends, and the other garbage that is popular now on regular tv can be seen after viewing Cable at its best. I have heard Sopranos many a time talked about as greatest. I do not have it there, I have spoken on what I feel is better. If you like Action and the movies I mentioned you will more then love this show.<br />Buy it and enjoy it over the years again and again
B004I744AS|4.0|Not only gives you spelling and definitions but also your horoscopes and games to play.  Also gives interesting facts and information on other trivia  Hasn't failed me yet.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Who else but Joss Whedon could get a movie made that completes a series cancelled after 14 episodes?  And poke Fox TV in both eyes in the process?  Mandatory and satisfying viewing for anyone who watched Firefly on TV.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I have been watching the TV show since it began and my husband and I love it. We are from Colorado so to have it based in Wyoming (even if it isn't) it feels like an old friend doing a good job as sheriff.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.  The contrast of grand, mythical action and modern-day reality was fun, the writing and acting was pretty good, and special effects impressive without seeming fake and tacked on.  After 5 minutes my wife, who rarely watches Sci-Fi movies with me, was on the couch next to me.  Now we're looking forward to watching 'The Avengers' together.
B00E6890RG|5.0|Haken is truly a progressive band. Not only in their musical style, but in the fact that they continue to progress and move forward with each album. The Mountain, album #3 is a mature record, but with the heavy elements that have put them at the top of prog metal alongside veterans like Dream Theater. Their vocals are even more complex and developed on this one, to add some extra goodness. Huge contender for album of the year in prog.
B005ZB91KY|3.0|Great story, they could have more action at the 60 minute mark of the movie, but they have a good use of the budget!
B00E9P959O|5.0|Rush is my favorite band. It's hard for me to say that I don't like a Rush album. Vapor Trails was for me an album full of great songs, but hard to listen to because it was too dense and there wasn't much space to breathe. The clarity of this remix allows you not only to distinguish all instruments, but you get some air to breathe. The way the original was done was great for the time and the situation. This version allows you to rediscover the gem that Vapor Trails has always been.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|i've lover her since american idol and this cd just tells me why. it takes you from american idol days to today. it's amazing. i love her.
B00DG86ARK|5.0|What an amazing Blu-ray. After a few great studio albums, only a great concert DVD would do. Great visuals, fantastic set list. Amazing! Anathema does it again.
B00354YA4A|4.0|McEwan has presented a childish crime with dire consequences. Atonement is called for, and the end leaves the reader with much to ponder.
B001O1O71C|4.0|\\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" shows the life of a boy (Bruno) who faces the troubling times of the rule of the Nazis and the use of concentration camps. Moving from Berlin with his parents and sister, he finds himself alone with no friends in their new house close to a camp. The discovery of a fence and the people in it leads him to embark on his journey of curiosity and to meet his new friend Schmuel. Little does he know his curiosity and friendship with Schmeul will lead to disaster and tragedy.<br /><br />The way that the book is portrayed is very interesting. The way Bruno is very unaware of what is going on makes the story a lot more interesting because while reading this book, it's hard to tell what Bruno is going to do or if he finds something out. In some ways he is very \\"on his own\\" and doesn't tend to notice what is going on around him.<br /><br />In some ways though, Bruno is very ignorant and doesn't pay attention, which in my point of view is a weakness in the authors writing. He is making Bruno look like a kid who is oblivious to what is father is or what he does. Knowing Schmuel for a year, and Schmuel being in the camp for such a long time, I think that Bruno would have realized what is happening to him and why Schmuel is inside the camp and can't come out.<br /><br />All in all, it is an emotional book full of its ups and downs. It shows how corrupt our world can be, yet it teaches the true meaning of friendship and kindness. The book is very good and I would recommend that everyone should buy their copy, read it and share it.
0515153656|4.0|Synopsis: the good guy kills a lot of bad guys.  Nothing wrong with that.  Not mindbogling, but entertaining.  Beyond that, the story is OK, but the idea of washing out $1 bills and printing $100s on them is silly.  However, the worst part is the stereotype of the evil southern town run by evil local politicians who should be wearing Klan hoods.  This is tired, old and way out of date.  Not a fun read.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I really liked what Abrams did with the old Kahn episode.The speacial effects were great, however I did'nt like the aspect ratio. the movie did not fill my screen
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|One of the best so far just wish energy would replenish faster and that there would be some sort of menu button.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I did not expect the overall twist of this book but should have considering I have read other books by Mr. Crouch. Took a while to get going, or should I say, it started and stopped in fits as it got going. Already reading book two.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|A fun, enjoyable novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer will take you on a wild journey full of child adventures that will take you back to your own childhood. This is a fantastic book, and it's short. Don't be discouraged by the fact that it was written in the last century. This book is timeless, and will be read for many more.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|From the first page, I was hooked! Pulls you in and makes you wonder what would you do??? I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to be drawn in and cannot wait to turn the next page. She took a few different peoples lives and made them intersect in such a way, it kept me wanting more!
B008MU8ZNO|4.0|Its a 1988 B movie.  Its actually really good.  Just watch it. Cant take it to serious.  Just a great kick back.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|The action and graphics are first rate.  What you would expect from a movie with Brad Pitt as the star.  However the story line and acting were horrible and mostly \\"C\\" movie level.  The very subliminal message (maybe not so subliminal) was that the lack of green living caused the epidemic.  The movie could not decide what it was.  Was it an action movie; was it a green movie; was it a family drama?  The family scenes were unnecessary and actually quite ineffectual.  At least it was not quite as bad as the Matt and Leonardo attempts at environmental lectures.  Why anyone gave this five stars is questionable.  Would have given this 3 to 4 stars with a better story line and acting.  Brad delivered this one as a Zombie.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Sometimes I try to put this game down and I found I couldn't. This game also helps me decide what meals to cook. Simply tons of fun.
B0081JFGQU|4.0|Good live music. Susan Tedeshi's voice is well represented Moving from sultry to stinging to hot. The guitar work is nothing less that excellent. Favorite tracks. Everybody's talkin' and Midnight in Harlem. The only negative I felt was that some of the jam sections wandered a bit.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|A must see for anyone that hasn't seen it. Treat your friends to this timeless classic, woot woot woot required word limit reached.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Awesome series. Integrates reality and fantasy smoothly! Great cast and sets. Amazing graphics, that take you right into the different worlds.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Not really that exciting. It is just a solitaire game. For those who like solitaire, it should be great. I need more excitement in my games or at least a few more options.
1451627297|4.0|When Jake Eppings, a high school teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine visits Al, the owner of a local diner, the latter reveals a time tunnel in the diner's kitchen, which could take him back to September 9, 1958, specifically at 11:58 a.m.  Al has traveled through the tunnel several times to buy cheap beef for his diner but in his latest trip, he tried to prevent John F. Kennedy's assassination. When his health begins to deteriorate, he returns to tell Jake everything and asks the teacher to take on the mission. Jake at first hesitates but eventually agrees to save Kennedy from Lee Harvey Oswald, and using Al's notes, he carries out the plan to stop the assassin. What Jake didn't realize is changing such a momentous event redirects the course of history, the Butterfly Effect.<br /><br />Time travel isn't new in literature and through nitpicking we can always find technical flaws. In this case, given the asymmetry of the time tunnel, it is interesting to ask: if someone at Lisbon Falls on September 9, 1958 steps into the \\"rabbit hole\\" what date and time would she emerge into?<br /><br />But nitpicking aside, Stephen King, through his research, succeeds in painting a picture of the cultural and social environment during the late 50s and early 60s, particularly in Maine and around the Dallas/Fort Worth area. King has delayed writing the novel for years because he needs time to research that era and he has succeed in the effort and written a novel that immerses the reader in the local climate of that period. And the characters come alive because of the local flavors.<br /><br />After reading the novel, the reader would reflect on the causality of historical events, i.e. the Butterfly Effect on a global scale. What if Hitler didn't rise to power? What if Gandhi remained a lawyer in South Africa? Would the world be better or worse in either case? We don't know. We observe a triumph or a tragedy in history and we evaluate it according to our values and biases but a triumph may lead to a catastrophe and a tragedy a breakthrough. I wonder whether one day our supercomputers can predict the course of human history through Genetic Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, and other stochastic estimation methods. But at any moment in history, without knowing the \\"global optimum,\\" we like Jake Eppings would still strive for the \\"best\\" according to our values. We are human. We are only human.lead to a catastrophe and a tragedy a breakthrough.

0316219266|5.0|Jeff Bezos went to an unconventional public-school program for gifted children in Houston. It focused on building creativity and independence among students, and encouraged outside-the-box thinking. Jeff went on to launch Amazon - now at $75 billion in sales, 97,000 employees, a $140 billion market value, and a reputation for sucking the life out of brick-and-mortar stores. En route, it expanded far beyond its original focus on physical books, launching the low-cost Kindle e-reader as well as adding innumerable additional products and even services - eg. delivering groceries. Today Amazon challenges America's leading retailer - Wal-Mart, another great entrepreneurial success story attributed to a similarly innovative and driven leader. Amazon lost hundreds of millions of dollars in its early years, and profits even now are miniscule by most standards.<br /><br />Why the satisfaction with low profits ($1.47/share over the past 5 years --> 10/21/13 stratospheric P:E of 222.4)- selling at low- or no-profit to pump ever more volume onto its platform, lowering fixed costs/unit and making competition more difficult - especially when potential entrants must also compete with Amazon shareholders (Bezos holds a majority; #2 by a wide margin is  Capital Group, a giant Los Angeles mutual fund with a reputation for having a long-term investment perspective).<br /><br />Bezos chose to locate in Seattle because of the city's reputation as a technology hub, its relatively small population that would be subject to sales taxes, and its relative closeness to one of the two big book distributors - Ingram. Bezos built the first two desks out of $60 blond-wood doors from Home Depot. The first real challenge - doing something better than existing Books.com. Spring '95 brought their beta website. Originally, when someone made a purchase Amazon would order it from one of the two major distributors, paying 50% of list price, then taking delivery before reshipping the book to the ordering individual. It took a week for most customers to receive ordered items, several weeks or even more for scarcer titles. Amazon offered up to 40% off list price for bestsellers, 10% on other volumes, and charged $3.95 shipping for single book orders. Early in June, a reviews feature was added, with many written by employees and friends. Bezos reaction to complaints from publishers over negative reviews made him realize that Amazon didn't make money selling things, but when it helps customers make purchase decisions. Early orders came from overseas troops and those in the U.S. living far from bookstores in the U.S., as well as individuals looking for relatively scarce titles (the 'long tail'). The first week brought $12,000 in sales, and within the month they'd made sales in all 50 states and 45 other countries - helped by being featured on Yahoo's site. Even at that early point Bezos envisioned becoming the next Sears, despite having only 40 books in the Amazon warehouse. Revenues grew 30-40%/month in early 1996, and that summer it began allowing other websites to collect a fee ($8) for referring buyers to Amazon. Another boost came from a new program ('Similarities') that grouped customers with similar purchasing histories and suggested additional purchases they might not even have thought of.<br /><br />In 1996 Amazon had $16 million in sales, vs. $2 billion for Barnes and Noble. B&N, along with Borders, had driven down the market share for independent bookstores from 33% to 17%. B&N wanted a joint website with Amazon, threatening to build its own otherwise. Bezos declined, reasoning that a small upstart on its own would be much more effective than if partnered with a large firm with most of its business in other formats. B&N then spun off its dot-com subsidiary, while Amazon expanded into music and DVDs. Bezos' prediction was born out - B&N was reluctant to lose money on a small portion of its business, to commit its best employees to it, or to totally revamp its shipping methodology.<br /><br />Bezos and Amazon took advantage of the 1998-2000 dot-com boom to raise $2.2 billion, mostly for acquisitions/investments in other firms, and constructing five new state-of-the-art distribution centers. Most of the money was wasted - two of the centers were later closed (McDonough, Georgia and Seattle - the latter relegated to Christmas duty), and investments in Pets.com, Homegrocer.com, urban delivery service Kozmo.com, Drugstore.com, comparison shopping tool Junglee, etc. mostly failed. Another unsuccessful initiative - trying to compete with eBay in 1999. Amazon also paid tens of millions to be the exclusive bookseller on portals such as AOL, Yahoo, MSN, and Excite - unfortunately Stone neither defined just what 'exclusive' meant in these instances nor reported any results. Much more positive was the introduction of 'Amazon Sales Rank' informing potential buyers of the popularity of each item and motivating authors, manufacturers, etc. A 19-page patent application was filed and accepted, the appropriateness of which is still debated to this day.<br /><br />Bezos' lack of focus on the bottom-line eventually brought highly critical analyst reviews (Ravi Suria - predicting imminent collapse) and the stock price fell to as low as $6. Amazon then undertook cost-cutting steps and layoffs of about 15% of staff. All TV advertising was canceled after tests showed very little impact. On the plus side, free shipping began during the 2000 XMas season for those ordering $100 or more, later lowered to $25 in 1/2002. Later yet came Amazon Prime - free two-day delivery for an annual $79 fee. (Amazon Prime customers doubled, on average, their spending on the site.) Personally written commends on individual products were replaced by the Amabot algorithm in 1/2002, and it achieved its first profitable quarter. Its stock price rose 25%.<br /><br />A Bezos 'Aha' moment came during a presentation by middle-managers wanting to improve cross-group dialog and coordination. Bezos, instead responded that such communication was actually a sign of dysfunction, that instead Amazon should figure out ways for teams to communicate less with each other. Decentralization and independent decision-making were keys to accomplishing that. This perspective spread after Frederick Brooks' 1975 'The Mythical Man-Month' pointing out that adding manpower to complex software projects delayed progress - partly because of the resulting increased need for time spent communicating. Bezos eventually reinforced this logic be reducing middle management layers.<br /><br />Bezos also decided he would no longer have one-on-one meetings with subordinates - these tended to be filled with trivial updates and political distractions. Power Point presentations were also banned - Bezos saw theme as generally superficial. Instead, narrations were handed out prior to meetings (6 pages or less, excluding footnotes, tables) and read silently prior to discussion. Whenever a new feature or product was proposed, it was also decreed that it take the form of a mock press release and make clear how the customers would be advantaged.<br /><br />Amazon's rapid rise eventually exposed operational weaknesses - Bezos brought in Jeff Wilke from Allied Signal, where he'd been a V.P. at age 32. Standard performance metrics and regular follow-up, standard work hours, and the use of algorithms to help manage operations followed. After a major review about a year later, Amazon decided that its operations were a core competency, not a commodity. Unique processes were developed to transition from 'pick-to-light' 'wave-based picking' systems that batched orders at sorting machines, creating delays. Another accomplishment - extracting discounts from UPS by developing alternatives with FedEx and the USPS. Amazon explored new sectors by allowing 3rd-party vendors to initially dominate new areas while Amazon studied and learned prior to making its own offerings. Pricing bots crawled the Web, spying on competitors and adjusting Amazon pricing accordingly. 'Search Inside the Book' allowed customers to browse through books, simulating visiting a bookstore with physical books.<br /><br />Amazon bought Kiva Systems in March of 2012 for $775 million.  The intent was to improve warehouse productivity by bringing bin racks to human pickers/stockers and returning them to the main floor. It should be noted, however, that the robots can only lift a maximum of 3,000 lbs., severely limiting bin rack height/capacity and thereby, warehouse capacity as well. In October Amazon announced it was taking on 50,000 additional workers for the holiday season when demand goes up as much as 4X ( more than ever), and this year it plans on 70,000. I'm doubtful on the utility of this nearly $1 billion investment.<br /><br />Other recent new ventures include Prime instant Video, Kindle Owners' Lending Library, allowing 3rd-party sellers the option of warehousing within Amazon warehouses and making their items eligible for Prime benefits, Amazon Publishing, and updated and cheaper Kindle readers.<br /><br />So what guided Bezos in his journey? Bezos analyzed several large companies such as Apple, Costco, ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, and Nike to determine why some are cherished by customers and others feared. His conclusion - being polite and reliable wasn't enough, it was also important to be perceived as an explorer. Bezos also followed Sam Walton's lead in learning a lot from competing retailers, as well as from leading business book writers such as Clay Christensen. Still another similarity, this time to Steve Jobs - he demands more of his staff than they could possibly deliver.<br /><br />Stone sees Google and Amazon as two of the few companies that really think big. Google experiments in many places outside its core search and advertising business - bringing broadband to selected U.S. cities, pursuing solutions to disease and mortality, and creating a self-driving car. Amazon, for its part, is now a leading provider of cloud services, is rumored to be developing a set-top box, and has invested in startups pursuing 3-D printing, Bezos spends a day each week working on innovations in space travel (Blue Origin), and recently purchased 'The Washington Post.' (Speculation is that one motivation for Bezos' purchase of 'The Post' is the potential political influence thereby also acquired - aka Rupert Murdoch and 'The Wall Street Journal. Bezos simply claims that new models need to be created in media.)<br /><br />Bezos, like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Steve Balmer, and Andy Grove, can be incredibly intense in his interpersonal relationships with underlings. Nonetheless, it was still quite surprising to learn that Amazon's median employee tenure is only 1.0 years. The IBM median is 6.4 years, H-P is 5.2, Intel 4.3, Microsoft 4.0, Wal-Mart 3.3, and Google 1.1. New Amazon hires get an industry-average base salary, a signing bonus spread over two years, and a grant of restricted stock spread over 4 years. Unlike Google and Microsoft stock grants that vest evenly year by year, Amazon employees typically get 5% at the end of the 1st year, 15% the second, and then 20% every six months over the final two years. Subsequent grants vest over two years and are similarly back-loaded. Managers in departments of 50 or more are often required to 'top-grade' subordinates on a curve and dismiss the least effective. Once a week, usually Tuesdays, departments meet with their managers to review spreadsheets of data important to their business. A Weekly Business Review takes place on Wednesday - 60 retail managers meet with Sr. V.P. Wilke. Bezos usually spends his time on newer businesses.<br /><br />Amazon has given in on the sales-tax fight, one of its earliest competitive advantages. Many new features have replaced it. Amazon's latest major initiative is same-day delivery. Others are following the same path - 1-800-Flowers.com, eBay, and Wal-Mart among them. Experts are dubious, early ventures have failed - particularly involving groceries.<br /><br />Now it has awakened a sleeping giant, Wal-Mart. It expects $10 billion in e-commerce revenue for the year ending 1/2014; already in August 2013 its Walmart.com site had almost half the unique visitors of Amazon.

All Amazon Is Missing Is a Profit') reports Amazon's cumulative profits approximate only $2 billion over 17 years.

0307389839|5.0|I loved this book because I too am a marathon runner although I am not as talented a runner (or writer!!!!!) as H Murakami. I am one of those big guys that 're still out running while the Murakami's are going back to the food line for seconds.<br /><br />But I still enjoy running as much as any runner and there is an essence to distance running that is difficult to put into words - which is what Murakami attempts here, to a certain extent. To another extent this is a sort of autobiography much in the way the On Writing is as much an autobiography of Stephen Kings as it is a writing treatise. Highly recommended, especially for runners.

0385351399|4.0|Living in our present social media world, The Circle is enlightening to all of us.  Eggers depicts the breadth of communication and community to extremes to create a frightening version of world dominance.<br /><br />Mae Holland is a bright young woman who comes from a simple middle class background.  She is an only child of hard-working parents who are proud of their daughter's new job at The Circle, a vast company with tentacles into every phase of human exchanges based on communication.  Mae is a college graduate who won the position, probably with the influence of her good friend, Annie, who is literally working her way up the corporate ladder.<br /><br />The story is what I expected in terms of sophisticated media, audio and video with direct interference into our lives.  The complexity and usage of the phenomena is used to grow The Circle into an international power.  Heading up the company are The Three Wise Men (far flung from the Magi), each one has his own idiosyncrasies and acts benevolent, but they (at least two of them) are traditional corporate bosses who are striving to increase their power.  They do not hesitate to mold staff into their visions.  It was quite interesting to listen to the hierarchy speak to the staff on every level.  I found, \\"would you like that?\\" from a leader to a staff person constantly repeated until the employee is cajoled into believing the upper echelon of physical and emotional monitoring is supreme.<br /><br />Mae is rather naïve.  She is so grateful for this job, she quickly is cast under the spell of their new techie validations of spying: SeeChange, TruYou, etc.  Mae's father is suffering from multiple sclerosis and their lack of good healthcare diminishes his health and their financial resources.  Annie works magic and her parents are placed on The Circle's health insurance relieving them of that burden but replacing it with direct video and audio interference in their lives.  It is humiliating.<br /><br />Mae has quickie sexual relations at work with two men, one is symbolic of impotence and control, and the other encounter is one of lust and secrecy.  During Mae's tenure at the company, she evolves into a star and she is obsessed with being the best and her need to be \\"liked' is fanatical.<br /><br />Dominance is a central theme, of course.  The fish tank scenes are especially poignant and frightening as a shark consumes the lesser animals in methodical order.  These episodes are replications of The Circle's systematic control and governance of their staff and the outside world.<br /><br />There are many obvious dichotomies in the book with order vs. chaos and freedom vs. total power.  Eggers' had a preponderance of solutions for total ascendancy.  Quite scary but not surprising.  Mae's separation from her parents was the saddest commentary.  I expected her to have some backbone when she would have episodes of despondency but she chose to give away her integrity instead.ie sexual relations at work with two men, one is symbolic of impotence and control, and the other encounter is one of lust and secrecy.

0143119680|2.0|Um...I can't say I'm sorry to have read it, but I also can't say I enjoyed it all that much either. I know this one was really popular, so I was probably just a poor match for the book. But I didn't care for it.<br /><br />There were a lot of things included that did nothing to move the story along. For example, the main characters rowed, ran, did yoga, rode horses, played chess, billiards and scrabble, ate elaborate dinners, had tea/coffee and tasted expensive wines. On their own none of these would be problematic. But each was described in minute detail, often more than once. So all together it really slowed the plot down.<br /><br />There was a lot of talking about things, but very little doing. Seriously, the characters discussed everything, told each-other every little secret of their species and confided their secrets with ease. But they actually did very little...unless you count the jaunty horse rides and agonisingly well thought out dinners. Then in the end they established some elaborate plan that never materialised. Nope, it's apparently the next book. Um, yeah, how unsatisfying is that? Other than the bad guys, no one seemed to actually have any volition of their own. They responded to immediate threats and then settled right back into the humdrum again.<br /><br />I also wasn't particularly fond of Diana or Matthew. Diana was supposed to be this strong-willed, self-aware, successful woman. But she just flailed around hopelessly, fainted regularly, took orders and, starting about halfway through the book, seemed to be put to bed about a hundred times. Sometimes it felt like she never even made it out of bed before being manhandled back into it 'for her own good'. This left her feeling very child-like to me.<br /><br />Similarly, Matthew was supposed to be the big alpha dog vampire but he just seemed shy and awkward around Diane, got beat up more when he attempted to protect her and did yoga. There's nothing wrong with yoga of course, but it does kind of run counter to the big bad vampire persona he was supposed to have. All-in-all did didn't come across as the man he was described as being.<br /><br />Lastly, the romance seemed to come out of nowhere. It wasn't quite insta-love, but it wasn't far off. Even worse, once it settled in Diane and Matthew were saccharine sweet. Their dedication to one another was admirable, but I can only take so many heartfelt declarations of adoration and I generally like to know what such passion is based on. The whole latter 1/3 of the book just seemed to be one impassioned 'I love you' after another. The words might change for varieties sake, but the intent never did.<br /><br />I did enjoy the underlying themes of acceptance and self actualisation. I thought the writing itself was fine and some of the side characters (Marcus and Hamish especially) were fun. I'm not claiming it isn't a good book. I just didn't enjoy it personally.run counter to the big bad vampire persona he was supposed to have.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is a really good read. I read each night before bed and I could hardly wait until bedtime.<br />I accidentally read it in quarters. The first quarter I was sure Nick did it. The second quarter I was worried that he did. The third quarter, in my mind, is about Amy and her part of this story. The fourth and last quarter is both highs and lows for me. What about the future???????? It kind of made me mad.<br />Gillian Flynn, you are one MIGHTY good writer. You have managed to tell this complicated tale so that it is understandable and believe able. I do think it is one of the best books I have ever read. I am going after your other books now.<br />I don't think this is a very good review but it is a wonderful book.

B00EO10M54|4.0|After releasing 'Can't Be Tamed' in June 2010, Miley proclaimed she would take a break from music in order to pursue an acting career and being inspired by life. She truly did, and many good and bad things happened between that album and 'Bangerz'. There was huge controversy due to a leaked video of her smoking salvia, she went on tour, she acted in 2 negatively received movies (LOL and So Undercover), she got engaged to Liam Hemsworth (and later broke up with him), she chopped off her hair and dyed it blonde, she grew up and officially entered her 20s, she officially cancelled her contract with Hollywood Records and signed with RCA, she hired a whole new management team, and she finally started working on her next album. She turned into a new person, an independent woman who takes her own decisions, and she prepared to release new music without Disney's help and guidance. She officially released the controversial lead single 'We Can't Stop', her rebirth and the beginning of the Bangerz era. The album was released in October 2013, and I'm going to review it:<br /><br />1. Adore You - The album's first track. A ballad that opens the album, about basically adoring someone, it sounds more mature than Miley's previous ballads and her voice is a lot stronger and more grown up. I like it, but it's not my favorite song. I give it a 8.5/10<br /><br />2. We Can't Stop - The album's second track and first single. The song that started her rebirth, it's a song about a house party in which everyone takes over, produced by Mike Will Made-It who helped Miley créate a new image and her new musical direction. The song marked Miley's rebirth and it's a departure from her previous work, as it's a mixture of pop, dance and R&B and not too electronic or rock heavy. Definitely the album's highlight, it was a perfect choice to start the era, the song will be very remembered for its catchiness (as well as the highly controversial music video and VMA performance). I give it a 10/10<br /><br />3. SMS (Bangerz) - The album's third track. A collaboration with miss Britney Spears, definitely another highlight, Miley and Britney's voice sound incredible together, not much to say about it. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />4. 4x4 - The album's fourth track. A song that mixes country and hip hop elements, Miley sings with a Southern accent about how she's a female rebel, it's very different but I found myself replaying it a lot, it's very addictive and one of my favorites. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />5. My Darlin' - The album's fifth track. I didn't really feel the song at first, as I found it very repeatitive (as Miley and the featured artist Future keep singing 'My darlin', stand by me'), but now I actually like it, it's relaxing and I love its production. I give it a 9/10<br /><br />6. Wrecking Ball - The album's sixth track and second single. A ballad about a breakup, in which Miley says that she will always want her former lover, and uses a wrecking ball to say how she fell hard. The strongest ballad on the album, it's accompained by a dubstep infuenced breakdown in the chorus which reminds me of Rihanna's 'What Now'. It also caused controversy, due to the video in which she appears naked swinging on a real wrecking ball. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />7. Love Money Party - The album's seventh track. A club-ready track similar to Rihanna's 'Pour It Up', about wanting love, money and a party. Like Rihanna's song, I found it a bit out of place and boring, don't like it that much. I give it a 6/10<br /><br />8. #GETITRIGHT - The album's eighth track. A a feel-good Summer track, originally planned to be the album's lead single, it reminds me a bit of Daft Punk's 'Get Lucky'. It's really cool, but I think 'We Can't Stop' was the right choice for the lead single. I give it a 9/10<br /><br />9. Drive - The album's ninth track. An electronic track about a lover who lied, it's very addictive and would be a good single choice. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />10. FU - The album's tenth track. The song probably chronicles her breakup with Liam, she's basically saying \\"f*** you\\" to him and angrily says he broke her heart, and wonders why he did what he did. Musically it has a crazy piano with an electronic production behind, it sounds like a comedic song or something like that, but I love its vibe. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />11. Do My Thang - The album's eleventh track. The weakest track on the album, it sounds like pure filler and the lyrics sound stupid, she swears too much. 'We Can't Stop' may have lyrics about partying irresponsibly and all that, but they are truly secondary to the catchiness, anthemic nature and genius production, this song isn't even catchy. I give it a 1/10<br /><br />12. Maybe You're Right - The album's twelfth track. Another breakup ballad, in which Miley tells her former lover that he might think she's crazy, lost and foolish for leaving him behind, and that he could be right. It's very cute and her vocal performance is strong. I give it a 9/10<br /><br />13. Someone Else - The album's thirteenth track. This is like an instant sequel to 'Maybe You're Right', as it seems her ex was right and she's presumably telling someone interested in her that she can't help him, because she's turned into someone else and she's hurting herself. I give it a 9/10<br /><br />Deluxe bonus tracks:<br /><br />14. Rooting For My Baby - The album's fourteenth track. Damn, this song is just so good, it's a smooth acoustic track about being in love with someone, it was probably dedicated to Liam while they were together, it's my favorite song on the whole album and I pre-ordered the Deluxe edition just for this track, as I fell in love with it just by hearing the preview. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />15. On My Own - The album's fifteenth track. A song that chronicles her rebirth and doing things on her own, it reminds me a bit of Madonna's 'She's Not Me'. I give it a 9/10<br /><br />16. Hands In The Air - The album's sixteenth track. I'm not too fond of this song, Ludacris' verse didn't help either. I give it a 6.5/10<br /><br />'Bangerz' is definitely a complete departure from Miley's previous works, and it's the end of her transition from a teen pop sensation to an adult pop superstar. Still, I give it a 4/5 on Amazon because there were 3 songs I didn't enjoy. 'The Time Of Our Lives' and 'Can't Be Tamed' maybe weren't her definite transition, but I liked all of the songs on them so they remain my favorite Miley albums. Miley has stated that she feels disconnected from her previous albums and that she feels like 'Bangerz' is her debut album, and I understand it in a way, Miley is in a different place in her life and career, things have changed during the past 3 years and she's already entered adulthood. Still, I appreciate all of Miley's music, she's a superstar and her music is great, I don't care about her public image, she's free to do whatever she wants to and express herself as she wants to. 'It's my mouth and I can say what I want to'.
B00E3IZIM0|2.0|Aliens dominating earthlings with the intent of taking over the planet. Humans making their last stand with international teamwork. Drawing intel from alien carcasses. Defeating the aliens by posing as one of them to sneak by the defenses and plant a bomb in their midst, with a suicide attack by tragic supporting player. The co-heroes are quirky nerds and studs. It's \\"Independence Day\\" with the aliens coming from below.<br /><br />Granted, some of these are overarching themes that you can find in invasion flicks dating back a half century or more. But, all of them matching up in the two movies?<br /><br />The acting is weak but the script would be tough to breathe life into. The visuals are good and the musical score isn't bad. If you liked \\"Independence day\\" and were contemplating a second viewing, this might be an amusing variation.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|After successfully transitioning into a more mature sound for her music with her 2009 EP 'The Time Of Our Lives', Miley released her third album (fourth CD overall) 'Can't Be Tamed' in 2010. Instead of continuing with her pop rock sound, she made a dance-pop album with electro and techno qualities, inspired by mainstream artists like Lady Gaga. This was a radical change from her old sound, but it wasn't bad at all, as she was able to experiment more with different sounds, delivering dance anthems like 'Who Owns My Heart' or electronic ballads like her cover of 'Every Rose Has Its Thorn'. According to her label, the album was a natural progression for Miley, but she later said that she's not being inspired by her sound and that she's hoping this is her last pop album. She also recently stated that now, over 3 years after this album's release, she feels completely disconnected from it. Despite all of these statements she's made, I think this album was important for her career, as all of her previous ones were and as her new one called 'Bangerz' is, as all of them were a part of her transition from a teen pop star to a dance-pop superstar. I love all of Miley's music, and I don't think she should be ashamed of her old music or regret making it, 'cause in the end it's the reason why she's relevant today. Here's my track-by-track review of this album:<br /><br />1. Liberty Walk - The album's first track. The perfect album opener for this album, as Miley conceptually portrays herself as a untamed independent woman. This song is an empowerment dance-pop anthem, with electronic heavy production with many synths and alarms. I love this song, it's basically a song about freedom and not relying on other people, a subject-matter that Miley constantly talks about in her music. It's one of my favorite songs on the album. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />2. Who Owns My Heart - The album's second track and second single. Another dance song, this is definitely THE highlight of the albumand a definite club banger, this song is also electro heavy as she sings about the thrill of meeting a potential love interest on the dance floor. It's another favorite of mine. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />3. Can't Be Tamed - The album's third track and first single. The album's lead single, this song caused a lot of controversy due to its lyrical content and its racy music video. I personally think there's nothing wrong about Miley expressing herself and her independence as she becomes a woman, she was never taken as a serious artist when she was Hannah Montana and it's evident that she loves to sing about freedom and independence, the video wasn't even that provocative as she's just dressed as a wild bird that escapes from the cage, showing she can't be tamed. The song itself is great and catchy and was a good choice to represent the album's theme as the lead single, but it's not my favorite song as I prefer the more \\"dancey\\" tracks. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />4. Every Rose Has Its Thorn - The album's fourth track. This is a cover of Poison's classic song, it's beautiful and touching, and like most covers I just appreciate it for what it is and don't compare it with the original, I basically treat it like a totally different song. The ballad shows that Miley is also a vulnerable person, and the production also has electronic elements. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />5. Two More Lonely People - The album's fifth track. The song has a simple plot where Miley says that if she and her boyfriend break up, there will be an empty space and two more lonely people. However, the song is musically very dance-pop and very catchy, it's really great. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />6. Forgiveness And Love - The album's sixth track. A very beautiful piano ballad in which Miley sings that our hearts are only made of forgiveness and love, the song has a nice message and it's just beautiful musically, one of my favorites. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />7. Permanent December - The album's seventh track. An electronic dance track in which Miley regrets leaving her boyfriend, and plans to get back together with him, the story takes place in December as Miley sings it's been like a permanent and cold December, very cool song and an álbum highlight. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />8. Stay - The album's eighth track. A ballad about missing someone badly saying that they're irreplaceable and wanting them to come back, it's very emotional and heartfelt, probably about Miley's deceased grandfather. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />9. Scars - The album's ninth track. Another song with electronic influences that uses scars as a metaphor for a past relationship, I've never really felt this one but it's still good, just not as catchy as other songs on the álbum. I give it a 7.5/10<br /><br />10. Take Me Along - The album's tenth track. Another breakup song, where Miley doesn't understand why her lover is leaving her, begging him to take her with him. Very well written and good musical accompainment. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />11. Robot - The album's eleventh track. An agressive song about wanting to be free and proclaiming one's independence, Miley returns to one of her most common lyrical themes. Her vocal performance is incredible as well as the production, it's probably my favorite song on the whole album. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />12. My Heart Beats For Love - The album's twelfth track. The ballad that closes the album, Miley stated that its dedicated to the gay community, as she sings that she's seen pain and suffering, and that her heart is beating for love and peace. I love it, it's a beautiful message and the perfect way to end an album about independence and freedom. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />This is definitely my favorite Miley album (along with her EP The Time Of Our Lives), it's generally electronic influenced with amazing dance anthems about breaking free and ballads about losses, missed opportunities and the desire for justice. It's Miley's ultimate freedom statement, very underrated as evidenced by the mixed to negative critical reception and its status as Miley's lowest selling album to date. The sales were mostly affected by the Can't Be Tamed video, which I honestly think doesn't offend anyone and isn't controversial at all. The costumes were a bit provocative, but it's not like other artists haven't done worse, people overreacted to it because it was Miley Cyrus, a Disney star back then who was the protagonist of Hannah Montana. This was her last album for Hollywood Records, as she cancelled her contract in January 2013 to sign with RCA Records (she owed them an album). Miley said that she would take a break after the album, and she did, as there's a 3-year gap with this and her current album 'Bangerz'.<br /><br />The Deluxe edition comes with the DVD of the 2009 Wonder World Tour in London and it's currently the only way to get it, so if you're a Miley fan and/or are interested in getting the official DVD of the tour get this edition of the album, the DVD has all the performances as well as video recordings of her stay in London with her friends, family and tour crew. The tour itself was great, the costumes were a bit provocative as well as the dance routines, but I had no problema with that. She sings songs mostly from Breakout and The Time Of Our Lives, as well as songs from Meet Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana: The Movie.
B009LDD1X0|4.0|Every so often, a sitcom gets it right and becomes part of Americana, ie: I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, The Odd Couple, Happy Days, Cheers, Friends and The Big Bang Theory joins this roster. BBT: Season Six is what you expect, although it's a little light on the extras. There is a nice music Video from Bare Naked Ladies(We all Love the theme song). It's very well thought out and clever. My Only problem is, just like Season Five, they changed the color of the box from Frosted Clear to Black. What the hell? Most people who buy TV on DVD have collections and they show them off to people. This series looks nice and uniform until you get to Season Five. It then looks like another  show from afar. Will Season Eleven feature Pink Boxes? I bought some 3 disc frosted boxes so it looks fine. However, after I forked over the money for the discs, why should I have to correct this nonsense? Other than that, if you are a fan of the show, you have no reason not to buy Season Six . By the way, I phrased that sentence in such a way that if you imagined Sheldon's voice in your head, it sounds like something he would say.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Outstanding, thought provoking drama about choices one woman makes and the life she builds from it. Great acting, and realistic story lines. I loved it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Amazing show! The ending of each episode makes you watch the next episode; it's just that good. My wife and I watched the first two seasons within a week, I couldn't watch anything else.

B00BB8Q13A|5.0|As an English teacher I find this movie clever and very entertaining.  I even show small clips to my class to illustrate how popular plays were in England, the construction of the Globe theater, and the rules of society at that time.  The author wove many questions and rumors about Shakespeare in his script that were fascinating.  I would not show the complete movie to any class because of the sexual content but the final scene of the troupe performing &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; is excellent.

B00B22ASUM|4.0|this book was recommended to me by an animal lover and as such myself, i immediately  downloaded it to my kindle. no free sample first. a very touching story. not an example of particularly good literature, so if you are looking for high literature, this is not the book for you. but if you love animals and believe in their immeasurable enrichment of our lives - life without animals is very boring - then this book will warm your heart. well worth reading. and watch the clips on youtube ; amazing!

B00EL6AAEU|1.0|1st off, I have never been to Sea World; and I DO NOT approve of, nor condone, the capture of wild animals (or mammals) for entertainment purposes.<br /><br />That said, this is the most ridiculous and dishonest \\"documentary\\" I've seen in quite a while.<br /><br />\\"Sea World\\" is going to threat this the same as anyone, or any other 'entity' would, in an event where a WILD ANIMAL (in this case, Wild Mammal) attacks &/or kills someone... There's no \\"great conspiracy\\" here; and to suggest otherwise is obscene.  Using anyone's death, to promote your personal agenda, regardless of the facts, is obscene, no matter how you try to skew it.<br /><br />A woman is dead... it is what it is... it happens, in every conceivable \\"entity\\", PUBLIC & PRIVATE -- THEY'RE WILD ANIMALS/MAMMALS -- it's just way more common for the Public Entities (aka: Zoos)... but they all behave & blame, the same way, afterward: \\"Trainer error\\", or whatever... because, as these dummies have proven, yet again, some people just can't accept the truth, no matter how how simple that truth is, so they have to blame the deceased, to keep from being sued by an idiot, litigious society &/or family members, who want to place blame everywhere, except where belongs.<br /><br />Moreover, 99% of everyone interviewed in this \\"film\\" who talk about the \\"traumatized psychosis\\" of these KILLER whales -- are not qualified, nor schooled, in the psychology of ANY species... And none, have clearly conducted a formal or informal psychoanalytical study of a whale's behavior before, during, and after \\"capture\\" -- Therefore, 99% of everything presented in this \\"documentary\\" as \\"fact\\" by the FEW semi-qualified to speak on such a matter, is still pure speculation & conjecture.<br />-- And the people who SHOULD have been interviewed, weren't... or... those interviews didn't reflect the pre-determined \\"message\\" the Director wanted to put out, so they were discarded & left out of the, LOL, \\"documentary\\".<br /><br />That said, yes, common sense would dictate they (captured 'wilds') COULD & MAY VERY WELL BE \\"scarred\\" by the events... But there's NO evidence the Orcas ARE, nor, any other \\"captured\\" animal, mammal, reptile, etc.<br /><br />However, COMMON SENSE would also dictate, that these Trainers CHOSE A DANGEROUS PROFESSION, AND SOMETIMES, THAT DANGER BECOMES REALITY -- IT HAPPENS -- THEY KNOW THIS GOING IN & CHOOSE TO DO IT ANYWAY... JUST LIKE POLICE OFFICERS & FIRE FIGHTERS (only the former's is a million times more certain)!!<br /><br />Clearly, these people made their choice to work with these Dangerous Animals/Mammals... You don't blame the Animal/Mammal for the accident(s) because \\"they're just animals and don't know any better\\", or whatever... Well, you can't blame the \\"entity\\" either, because THEY DID NOT FORCE THE TRAINER TO BE A TRAINER, TO WORK THERE, etc.; and no matter how \\"humanely\\" a wild animal/mammal is captured, transported, and housed... it is, and will always be, (in this case, a LARGE), DANGEROUS, LETHAL THING... and no amount of \\"training\\" will remove that aspect of its nature!!<br />-- I swear, it's like all notions of PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY are as foreign as Orcas are to land!<br /><br />And the quote, \\"There's no record of any Orca being violent in the wild\\", was by far the most ludicrous of the countless, insane ramblings, offered up.  -- THEY'RE CARNIVOROUS (\\"KILLER\\") WHALES YOU IDIOT!!!<br />Plus, as if you can honestly compare the millions of hours of CONSTANT observation done in captivity, to A FEW HOURS of GLIMPSED \\"activity\\" out in the open ocean, as an actual comparison-argument... LOL; but they try, along with every other conceivable way, to mislead, and lie, rather than have an OPEN AND HONEST DEBATE about whether we should/shouldn't have captive 'wilds' at all (in 'Public' or 'Private' entities).<br />-- Personally, I would be 100% fine if every 'wild' was returned to the wild, set free, and all Zoos, etc., were closed entirely/permanently... but that will never happen... And these attacks, while extremely rare, will continue.<br /><br />Regardless, this is without question, the most insane, ideologically inept, maddening, and brain-numbing piece of crap, this year... possibly, of all time.

B001JIFYSA|4.0|Even years after the first time I saw this movie, it still moved me with those simple yet poignant threads of what drives, keeps, destroys, enhances, and cheapens love.  Tears welled again, and I remembered that place in my life where love still has magic.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The story line itself was great at every turn but there was no need for constant reminders about how each character is connected to Eva or Gideon.  It made the flow of the book appear as though it was wrote by an amateur author.  Hoping books 4 & 5 don't follow the same suit.

B00E3IZIM0|4.0|This review is for the 3D version Pacific Rim.<br /><br />The best thing about this (3D) movie is the graphics in my opinion, there's only one or two occasions throughout where you may notice some minor ghosting (depending on your TV you may not see any at all) but otherwise, the 3D image here is pristine. As far as the 3D graphics go, I put this one up there with Avatar and Tron Legacy which are my favorite 3D titles for 3D image quality and in my experience, the top 2 3D movies for the overall \\"pull you in\\" good time effect. Almost every scene exhibits an extremely clean and clear image with great black levels, punchy colors that burst off the screen and adequate brightness to be really engaging. You can easily see the texture of many of the clothes and uniforms of the characters as well as great delineation in many of the finer details within the image. The 3D effect is used very well to give a pretty good sense of depth to the movie as opposed to the more gimmicky, novel pop out of the screen type of stuff.<br /><br />The sound of the 5.1 mix that I listened to was pretty damn good if not quite up to the supremely high standard set by the 3D video. When the robotic fists fly and land smack dab on the chins of ugly aliens crunch, thud, whack, slap, crack is heard in crystal clarity. There's some really good LFE too. The main reason I'm a little less enthusiastic about the sound than I am about the picture is because of the slight lack of envelopment from the soundtrack. It's loud, brutal and clear almost all of the time but it doesn't always surround you with sound. The rear channels aren't used as effectively as they probably could have been. It isn't a deal breaker by any means as this is still an exciting, banging and crashing good time.<br /><br />The story is typical of movies of this genre and a few of the classic (cheesy) movie lines and scenes are there. The requisite Maverick/Iceman frienemies thing is there as well as the moment they gain a mutual respect and the adversarial posturing fades away. I was surprised that the acting wasn't terrible, sometimes movies like this which has mostly unknown actors (at least to me) and the story suffers because the actors can't sell the scenes. This movie was decently acted in spite of the mild cheesiness at times in the lines. All in all, not horrible but also not spectacular.<br /><br />3D video 5 (out of 5)<br />Audio 4.5 (out of 5)<br />Story  3.5 (out of 5)

B0047WJ12K|3.0|It's passable.  The problem is that one has to accept myriad of shaky premises as reasonable or possible in order to suspend disbelief and make it through this film.  Visually it's very impressive, and I'll admit that it's possible that had I seen this in a theater on a state of the art screen instead of watching it on my Kindle Fire on an airplane, I might have slobbered over it like the rest of the country.  But based upon plot and story alone, this just doesn't merit the accolades it has received.  It's a passable rental and worth renting, but that's it.
B00ECR7KX2|3.0|First of all, I love Joss Whedon's work.  I love Shakespeare as well, so this should have been a match made in heaven.  Alas, it was not.  While it was novel to see many Whedonverse actors in this production, many of them came across as though they were simply reciting lines and had little to no idea what they were saying.  Clark Gregg as Leonato was impressive, but too many of the others were flat and monotone.  I was excited to see Amy Acker cast as Beatrice only to be disappointed by a listless performance.  She came to life briefly during her \\"were I a man\\" speech, but was otherwise dull and lifeless.  I was surprised at the lack of chemistry between Acker and Denisof (seriously, how could Wesley and Fred have NO chemistry?), but there was nary a spark between the two.  Sean Maher (who I normally adore) does not seem to realize that playing a villain requires more than grimacing while reciting his lines.  Fillion, though amusing for the most part, seemed stiff and uncomfortable.  Too many members of the cast reminded me of my students reading their lines in class when we study Shakespeare.<br /><br /> I had no problem with the modern setting.  I recently viewed a production of Much Ado staged in a modern setting, using original Shakespearean text starring David Tennant and Catherine Tate as Benedick and Beatrice that was wildly entertaining.  This play could be performed on an empty stage with minimal props and be wonderful if the actors are comfortable with their roles and the dialog.  Unfortunately, that was not the case here.  The Whedon's have a lovely home, but it did not make up for the obvious discomfort of the cast with the text.<br /><br />I applaud Whedon for his love of Shakespeare and the fact that he gathers friends and family together to read and workshop various works of the Bard.  I would love to attend Nerd Camp at the Whedon's home, but this was not really a production that was ready for public consumption.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The plot and writing both pulled me in.  The author writes well, which elevates the book above where the somewhat tawdry plot could have taken it.
B006ELF6AI|5.0|I have four or five favorite shows, all cop shows, and this one is #1. Great character development and the interaction with the partners, G & Sam, Deeks & Kensi.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It looks and works great on the Kindle HD. However when someone send me extra moves,I can't find them to use them.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|I could never get this app to work. It wouldn't even load so I could never get my email of the server.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|the game wont download and I have tried over 5 times to make it work but it didn't so that's why its 1 star
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A little bit hard to figure out at the beginning, but almost one of the best Stephen King books I have ever read. EXCELLENT.
B003E6LC6I|4.0|Love this show! I particularly enjoy seeing actors we normally see as good guys being bad for a change. The last season is not as great though.
B00622B3MY|5.0|Great movie,  just like the first cars movie with most of the original voice cast and very good quality additional actors like Michael Caine.  Parents will love watching it with their kids.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Awesome story and characters! I love the parallels of today's society. I'm looking forward or reading more of Howey's writing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you should get it<br />it rocks<br />get it now it is worth it. nothing is better<br />get it now I mean now
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I didn't hear much about this film when I rented it, but I am very happy that I decided to have a look.<br /><br />The story is first rate, the characters are real and believable, and the movie was put together very nicely by first time director Dustin Hoffman.<br /><br />I decided to buy a copy because I enjoyed it so much.  I also enjoyed very much sitting through the commentary of Dustin Hoffman because I was able to hear how the film was put together.<br /><br />This film will give me much enjoyment for years to come.  You will not go wrong adding this film to your DVD library.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|On the surface this story is about the failed attempts to raise chimps with humans, but it has fairly deep implications for the nature of love and attachment. The characters are nicely realized, and it is easy to become involved with them. Their struggles even infiltrated my dreams.
0451205766|5.0|I wanted to read this book because I love the movie but I know there was more to the movie. So reading this book answered questions I had on things. The book explains things and has more going on then the movie does, but that's the way it is with movies. Loved reading this book. I recommend it highly. You'll find out where they got some idea's for Godfather II
B009AY04A8|4.0|Thought it keep you thinking. Love hidden objects. Characters are different . Comfareing pages is fun also. Kids like to play it all the time.
B001DM1VXE|5.0|If you are looking for a movie with lots of action and special effects this movie is not for you.  If you are into Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, and all the other fields that are be related to cognition, knowledge and the being; this movie is fascinating. Full of symbolism.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. I go for hours playing, now Amazon has it, I'll go for more  hours. Well that's the end of sleep......
B0058DDVXW|1.0|Do not get doesn't play on any of my dvd players and it took like a month to get to me...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive, I got so e,cited when I saw they finally made it  for kindle. Once you start, you can't stop.
B00DZPVS9O|5.0|The Bull God returns with a lavish feast for your ears.  From the Hawkwind channelling Last Patrol to the Ditko inspired Mindless Ones, every course is delicious.
B004G5VFOU|2.0|The \\"single\\" remastered version added 2 new songs to the original album [I just want you to know and Sittin' here thinking of my love]. This deluxe version added some other unrelated concert songs and a few demos, but, if the record company is charging extra for this edition [being called DELUXE], why not making it complete???
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It kept my interest.  It was hard to put down the book.  Now I'm waiting for his next one. John Grishman has never let me down.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The product works well.  It is always able to wake me even when I 'm quite tired.  I can set many different allarms at different times, and have different sounds or mp3s to sound the alarm.  The alarm starts quitely at first,  which is nice because it doesn't startle you.  Great product.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We weren't certain what to expect with this show but it grabbed us and we are hooked!  We definitely recommend it!
B000001GPX|5.0|This disc, compiled from recordings made in 1975 and 1976, brings together two recordings that previously dominated the available recordings at that time and now, coupled together, has become a reference point for considerable numbers of collectors. The recordings in their latest mastering are very good and no cause for concern.<br /><br />The performances are both high powered in concept with a powerful sense of forward motion maintained throughout. These are full sized modern orchestra versions but the VPO is of such a quality that they are able to deliver clarity at speed that is normally the preserve of period orchestras. General critical acclaim has been universal for these two recordings but there has always been a marginal preference for the fifth symphony performance. That is certainly delivered at white heat. The seventh though is not far behind with the dance element to the fore.<br /><br />This disc is practically self recommending and all I can do is to add my own support and the suggestion that it deserves a place on any collector's shelves.
B00993FEUK|4.0|really nice for the family even though my parents are not from here the understand and had a good time
B002361MLA|5.0|this is the second book I have read from Eckhart Tolle. I enjoy it very much. It is a relaxing book and helps you to help yourself.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Entering the world of Ender's Game is thrilling, but understanding and entering Ender's mind as he is trained to become a compassionate war machine is a unique journey that will leave you asking questions long after you have finished reading,
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|Awesome  love this show love Eric  I loved the books Best show on TV Can't wait to watch the other seasons
B00E6895M6|5.0|Great great great record, the best I've heard in a while in terms of consistency. It's the kind of record that you listen to over and over again because it's easy to get, it's deep and it's catchy. An overall very fun listening experience. Every song is good, this isn't mindless pop music as one or two reviewers suggest but if you think it is then I suggest that you actually listen to what she's saying. 5 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad it came available on my kindle, love it and was worth the wait. Looking forward to get and give lives to my fb friends.
B007EC27QM|2.0|The calculator that is comes installed on my phone has trigometric functions, parentheses, and squaring. This one has none of those.  What you are paying for is a history.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|One of the best dramatic series I've ever seen. Casting, costuming and acting make the beautiful storyline even more poignant. I laughed and cried.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun, I have played many of these games.  this was one of the best. i would highly recommend. puzzles are medium easy.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Our 4 and 6 year olds love this game and we do too - nice graphics, easy to manipulate, instant gratification!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so challenging as you work through it. Very awesome for anyone who doesn't have vertigo issues. So glad my husband found it :-)
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|For scholars, it is probably no surprise Jesus of Nazareth had a very specific context in the uprising  of Jewish nationalism against the Roman Empire. What Aslan does well is to popularize that history in clear, engaging prose, and to show how Jesus evolved from rabble-rouser to a depoliticized humanistic Messiah in the first 300 years of the Church. Before the church was Church, it was in the streets. Jesus was the original streetfighting man.
B00DHHWXYY|1.0|This is the most bizarre making of The Great Gatsby imaginable.  There is no magic, there is no sheer fun and exuberance.  The<br />whole feeling of the Jazz Age is missing.  For a really &#34;great&#34; Great Gatsby, buy the Robert Redford/MiaFarrow one (with a very<br />young Sam Waterston).  It has some years on it, but it is perfect.  The lavish party scenes are lavish but not ridiculous.  Robert<br />Redford is so natural in the role that one cannot imagine anyone else tackling it.  I am sorry to be so negative, but I cannot<br />think of one positive thing to say about this movie.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This novel by Stephen King follows the pattern of his other books: a supernatural presence, great character development, and suspense.  I really liked the book.  I just didn't care for the characters of &#34;The True&#34;.
B00679T1EO|5.0|wonderful series and great product that is fun to watch.<br /><br />I really like the images on the front of each series.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I'm still trying to figure it out.  I like the look of it and I'm still learning about it but it seems good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great to trian your brain....It is the best or should I say amazing!!!!!!!If anyone gets it they will love it!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Very enthralling book....but after about the first book and a half, it's like. \\"Oh, they are going at it again\\".  Really liked the heroics of Ana in this book, though.  Really good twist!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Better than I expected from a new writer.  Kept me glued to my kindle and looking forward to reading the sequel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I would love to see more levels of this game come very very soon it was very very<br />challenging and a lot of fun.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Its awesome! Always keeps me on the edge. It's better to own it no commercials and all. Recommended to all my fellow ladies.
B00D2ZF24O|1.0|Ok, so let's showcase your No-Talent Kid in a movie and sleep through it so<br />you HAVE TO WATCH THE KID!<br />This thing was a joke!
B006LSZECO|2.0|the rest of the story got a little crazy for my taste, seemed like the writer hurried to meet a deadline. cannot believe they are making a movie of this? Not a Ben Afleck fan so will probably skip it or rent it.
B00C2FFJFM|2.0|Other than a couple of songs this album has no substance. By far the worst Selena Gomez album! Not worth the money!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun fun fun. Love the powerups and variety. You can play by yourself or invite friends for6 more bonuses. Can play any time. Love the daily free rounds and slots.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My favorite game even when I am stuck on a level for several days.  The only way I stop playing is when I run out of lives.  This is the best free game in the app store.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I truly enjoyed this Limited Edition 3 of Walking Dead Complete Season. I watched it all and is was better than the last two seasons. The Limited edition is really cool with the Heads encased. The price was really good and arrived on time. Thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun and very addictive. You can play when everything around you is quiet or noisy!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I watched the entire Second season of Walking Dead and it was awesome. I really like the show as i was watching it on TV but nothing better on a Dvd of your own. The price was good and arrived as expected. Thanks.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Good story line, fast read, nothing like the movie thank goodness.  Nothing deep, but fun to read, moving on to next one in series
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|The Complete Season One of Walking Dead was truly amazing show. I watch the entire set several nights and i really liked it. The price was good and shipped as promised. Thanks.
1416914307|5.0|I have read the reviews of the next few books and don't plan on ruining my happiness I feel with the end of this original 3 books. It left everything just as I was hoping. Just great!
B008Y212PI|4.0|fun and challenging. I love playing! Became addicted right after<br />t<br /><br />I played it for the first time. Love all the puzzles.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I really enjoy the show, Lark Rise to Candleford for its content and the acting and general messages along with it.  It has good values and shows up even with the humor involved.  I would recommend this to families and adults as well.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Crystal clear picture, classic plots and breakthrough concepts - what could be better? Star Trek singlehandedly made science fiction mainstream.
0761172726|5.0|Lots of stickers and Emergency Contact List included. Contains five columns for each family members schedule. Excellent for the organized Mom.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|I love love love the Vampire Diaries.  If Vampires are your thing, then this series is for you.  If you a fan already this is a must have !!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was a really enjoyable book. I thought the author did a great job in the describing the living conditions in the silo. The characters and their situation was believable. I cringed through the section where Juliette went under water! I'm wondering when the movie will be out?
B006E4QCXU|4.0|THis is a really cool app.  I down loaded it b/c I was unsure of what it was.  It is a really great way to pass the time. Esp. for the kids.  To keep them entertained
B00985E3UG|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who wants to understand how processed food is produced to keep consumers eating more and more of it even when the food is not the healthiest,  Salt, sugar and fat each have their own sections in the book and it is pretty clear that the products in the food stores are engineered to such a degree that without being aware of the way these chemicals stimulate our brains to want more it is easy to for example get a bag of cookies and plan to just eat one or two each day then suddenly have eaten just about the whole bag,  If you are interested in food I highly recommend this book.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I love Mahjong so I down loaded this game.  It is ok, just a version of Mahjong. Nothing really special about it, it not aweful. Just ok, you have to try it to find out.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Very interesting reading, makes you want to find a time machine and go back to change habits you never knew you had.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|I am an avid Disney animated movie collector.  I am currently updating all of my movies from VHS to Blu -Ray.  If you collect these movies, you need this in your collection.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'm only half way through the book, so much has happened!! The whole series has been amazing so far. Can't wait to read them all!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|If you like You Tube and use it at home, then you need to get this app.  I love this app on my device.  It takes a little getting used to but it is great to look stuff up.
0385349947|5.0|As chair of a woman's network at my company, I too have heard single 23-year-olds fret about how they'll someday, hypothetically, balance work and family.  What's making us so scared?!  I loved Sandberg's frank analysis of the roadblocks keeping women from doing what they really want.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|I love love love the Vampire Diaries.  If Vampires are your thing, then this series is for you.  If you a fan already this is a must have !!!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I know these all by heart and I keep watching them anyway. I love this show. It's exciting. The people are interesting. The ship is cool.  The society is thought provoking. I wish there were 10 more seasons.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you are on FB at home then you need this app on your device. Comes in really handy to be able to communicate with family and friends thru FB.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|No matter the reason it is finally here and it's great! I did have some issues connecting to Facebook. Hopefully those will get fixed.
B003E48AYC|5.0|I love Johnny Depp.  He was the reason I got this movie.  He and the rest of the cast do an awesome job in this movie.  A must have for your movie collection.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I spent way too much time on this when I first got it, it was good clean fun. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|This is one of the first movies I bought on blu ray.  This is my all time favorite movie.  I would not ever be with out it.  The graphics on blu-ray are awesome !!!
B00DP8XSQ2|4.0|but i like the idea of having this on my tablet. i seen before and think one of better or more interesting apps to have..<br /> i hope to use when out camping on my world bicycle tour someday.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app on a daily basis.  It is really great to have around and look up local weather and plan things by.  I would tell anyone to get this app.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I really can't say much since u haven't read the book uet but yet to read, so please be patient
B00B22IJXK|2.0|I love Find it Games.  This one is okay.  You will only want to do each puzzle once and then delete the app.  Needs to be more challenging.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Love, Love, Love this! You can never go wrong with a Disney classic! Ariel is a favorite in our house!
B00881PTRC|5.0|This is a great App !!!  I don't normally care for hangman, but this app is awesome.  The animated graphics are so freaking funny, esp. when you lose the game !!!!  Get this app.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A wonderful twist of romance.  Easy to figure out what the ending would be but so enjoyed the story telling of this story.
B00846F1YW|3.0|I love Find it Games.  This one is okay.  You will only want to do each puzzle once and then delete the app.  Needs to be more challenging.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is an amazing read, several times over. It unlike any other and will draw you in and take you away to another time on a different earth!
B00683JK9K|3.0|I got this app. b/c I love puzzles.  It's not a bad app. It's not really that challenging for me.  Not bad if you want something to pass the time with.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you so much for finally getting this for the kindle fire love this game but is it only me that can't see the other players I can't see who I passed or who's catching up?
B004DM0UII|2.0|I down loaded this app when it was free.  I thought I would use it.  However, I did not.  Wasn't my thing and I couldn't figure it out.  I deleted it.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|What one would expect from a gifted Song writer and Talent like Sheryl Crow. Her voice and Lyrics make her work almost seem conversational and personal to you the listener.
B0064MT1QW|5.0|I love love love this movie.  I first seen it on tv but only partially. I had to buy it b/c I fell in love with the story. It is a must have and I still have yet to read this book. :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so glad that it was finally available for Kindle Fire.  And it is the real thing.  I am loving it.  I have had no problems at all with loading or freezing up, so far.  Hopefully, Candy Crush will continue to work perfectly on my Kindle.  Thank you, Amazon!!!
B00AHJL7BK|1.0|I down loaded this app b/c it was the free app of the day.  Turns out I really don't care for Sudoku.  If you like Sudoku you would probably like this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like  it so much  do u  I love=vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv=vBulletin so  do u like it u do  I do to I don't like rateing spppooppooo
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|I got this app when it was the free app of the day.  Wanted to see what it did.  Not a bad app. Would be really cute for kids.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|This is the follow up to ‘Operation Armada’ and the author has done a nice job of taking the characters further in what is a richer, more textured work. The plotting and pacing is great. This is one of those stories that sucks you in and keeps you up late at night wondering how it’s all going to end. One complaint is that I would have liked to have seen more references to other events that were happening in World War 2 at the time. But the ending - no spoilers – is truly brilliant and has left me anxiously awaiting the next book in the series.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|I love love this movie.  Natalie Portman does an excellent job in this movie.  She protrays the &#34;good vs. evil&#34; and her inner termoil just wonderfully.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I HAVE TO SAY I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THIS MOVIE WAS ABOUT. MY DAUGHTER LIKED IT, BUT I COULD HAVE GOT IT FROM RED BOX OR GOT IT ON A DISK FROM NETFLIX.
B00ANW33CM|2.0|I think I down loaded this app b/c it was the free app of the day.  I love Mahjong but I did not care for this app.  I deleted it.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THE PLOT. IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. I DON'T THINK I'LL BE PAYING TO SEE IT, I'LL WAIT UNTIL ITS FREE ON NETFLIX.
B00B19GKI0|4.0|Typical 80's movie with bad acting and thin plot, but had a lot of good action. Overall, I did like the movie.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I LAUGHED SO HARD WATCHING THIS MOVIE!!! I JUST HATED THAT I HAD TO BUY THE MOVIES TO WATCH IT. NOT THAT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE FREE BUT REALLY.....
B000000WFZ|1.0|I was very excited to receive this soundtrack based on the reviews it has gotten. What a huge disappointment.<br />The tracks are too short, disjointed and lack any consistency. Essentially, it is impossible to listen to and enjoy at the same time. Just when you think a piece is developing, it is cut short.<br /><br />I can only warn any perspective buyer: run. This is a waste of money.
B001KZG99A|3.0|FOR NOT BEING A FAN OF IRON MAN, IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE AND MY KIDS LOVED IT. MY SON RENTED IRON MAN 3, ON HIS XBOX BECAUSE IT WAS A LOT CHEAPER!
B001CISHU4|5.0|Well, there is absolutely nothing to complain about with this album, amon Amarth has remained consistent throughout their career but this album really defines their talent, killer vocals, amazing guitar tones and riffs, the drums are flawless. Not only that but the song writing Is stunning, I was captivated from the moment the album started to play with the title track \\"twilight of the thunder god\\". I can't say I have a favorite set of songs because I enjoy all of them equally, if you enjoy this band or death metal pick this up!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I LOVED HOW THE PARENTS HANDLED PARTS OF THIS MOVIES. OTHER THAN THAT I THINK I COULD HAVE WROTE THE ENDING MYSELF....
B00785P2QC|4.0|you can do lots of things on this game a little hard at first but then u catch on if u like to build city's it is good
B005UG542S|5.0|I LOVE ALL THE HARRY POTTER MOVIES, I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS ONE I HAD NOT SEEN YET BECAUSE I HAD TO RENT IT!
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|This is the first movie by Shyamalan that I have liked. I think that he finally found his genre. I have yet to watch a movie with Will Smith that I didn't enjoy and his son is fallowing in his fathers footsteps. It had action, drama, suspense, everything that we've come to expect from a Will Smith movie. I will definitely be adding this one to my collection.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE, I JUST DID NOT THINK THAT I WOULD HAVE TO BUY IT TO SEE IT.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|The special affects were great. It was action packed and had a great cast. There was even plenty of comedy, especially for an action movie. It was a new twist to a military/alien sci-fi. I will be adding this one to my DVD collection for sure.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Too much buffering on youtube app. Netflix and Google play dont work on Singapore. I am just stuck with device. I hv a good Internet connection. The video play at full resolution but it buffers too much so it should understand to lower the resolution but it keeps on playing at same.<br />I am not satisfied with product.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|This was a fun game. My kids and I sat and played together. It kept the family entertained on family game night. It's a winner with us!!
B005LAIHGI|1.0|this movie is very funny i like it a lot. unfortunately, when it came in all in perfect condition, it wasn't so perfect. put simply, i tried my two different DVD players in my living room. and my one DVD player/flat screen tv in my room. all said it was a bad disc and could not play it. now it just sits on my movies rack, as a movie that doesn't work. i guess it wasn't kidding when it said &#34;banned and unrated version&#34; hence the word &#34;BANNED&#34;.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is definitely the best first person shooter on the market for the Kindle Fires. I'm really excited to see the new changes in MC5 (Coming 2014 I believe)<br /><br />It's worth the $6 also, with no glitches or cons that I see, only positive things.<br />I would say I get 50-65 fps average with bad internet.<br /><br />Happy Shooting!
0765334798|2.0|An interesting idea, the characters never developed beyond defined role and the story seemed to impressed with tits own cleverness to develop in a natural way. The codas were superfluous as well.
1250030951|5.0|Gave this as a gift to a good friend of mine who goes to a different university than I do. It arrived two days prior than the expected delivery date and was, as far as I know, in great condition.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Could not get a complete picture from the kids as to why this one was a keeper. I heard the laughing going on but know that this one will be watched again in the future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally they have brought candy crush saga to the Kindle. Soo much fun and addictive. App works great to overall a great job by Amazon
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|Truly - are we the people that crazy to go wild and follow these horseman around- far fetched. Interesting story without the audience hipnotic craziness. I did not keep my eye on this movie the whole time because it did not provide enough to keep me watching. And knew who it was early on.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|You need real money to get most of the robots , upgrade suck .Reel steel hd is more better than this
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Like sci fi and watch what I can - I chose this over the bad reviews for After Earth. I liked the visuals for this. Kept me watching. Not sure if I understood the thing off of earth.And had several questions that left me hanging.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|LOOOOOOOOVE Bible!!! It has allowed me to grow within myself that u share and do outside of myself the things that God brings. It has also aloud me to share my thoughts with thousands of Followers, Seekers, The Lost and the hungry. God is amazing and so are those who have created this app, Thank you n &#34;GBWY †&#34;
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This provides some of the visuals for the books especially going forward. But books still provide more overall. Actors were well played. Looking forward to the next movie.
B004HO6I2E|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> 'The Change-Up' is an occasionally amusing farce involving two life-long friends who by sleight of hand, end up in one another's bodies. The big 'switch' occurs after a night of 'bromancing', where the two friends both find themselves urinating in front of a statue fountain, whose visage reminds one vaguely of the Statue of Liberty. The Statue appears to have some magical powers, which causes the transformation.<br /><br />Jason Bateman plays the 'straight' friend, Dave Lockwood, a workaholic attorney who is married with three kids in the suburbs. Ryan Reynolds plays Mitch Planko, his offbeat, somewhat vulgar friend, who provides the comic relief.<br /><br />Clearly the far more entertaining character is Mitch, who is continually pushing boundaries from the outset. So when Mitch becomes Dave, Dave has the much better part. We get to see how Mitch as Dave, upsets Dave's world. The humor comes from the fish out of water premise: Mitch simply doesn't fit into Dave's world--but somehow, in the end, he manages to improve it.<br /><br />For example, he eventually convinces the CEO of Dave's company to play hardball with a rival Japanese company, during a mediation, and Dave's company ends up making out like bandits. On the personal level, Mitch as David hilariously convinces Dave's daughter to meet 'violence with violence', so she retaliates after a school bully knocks her down during a ballet performance.<br /><br />Unfortunately when David pretends to be Mitch, there is no comic equivalence. The whole idea is that David needs to slow down and adopt Mitch's spontaneous lifestyle. There's nothing funny when he's forced to be aloof during Mitch's porno shoot, or the trip to the Aquarium or relaxing, watching a DVD of 'Animal House'. And there are also no laughs when he starts dating Sabrina, Dave's sexy colleague at work, where he finally learns to become more spontaneous.<br /><br />Mitch as Dave also falls into line, becoming more responsible as a good parent and eventually reconciling with his father, by attending his father's wedding. So by the end of the film, the best friends learn their valuable life lessons, but whatever humor was generated earlier, with the real Mitch doing his shtick and then Mitch as David doing his thing, is lost. Dave or Dave as Mitch, was never funny in the first place (regardless of the absurd 'poop attack' by Dave's infant, at the beginning of the film).<br /><br />A good part of 'The Change-Up' also relies on bathroom humor which has limited appeal. One particular scene that fails to fire is the big buildup for Dave's wife when she enters the bedroom, only to end up in the bathroom on the toilet, concentrating on a series of difficult bowel movements.<br /><br />In the end, this is a film that is mildly amusing in spots. Somehow if Dave also had some more significant idiosyncrasies like Mitch, this would have been a funnier film.ecoming more responsible as a good parent and eventually reconciling with his father, by attending his father's wedding.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|Battery HD Pro gives lots of information about battery life under many different conditions -- whether you're planning to listen to music or watch videos or any other of your favorite Kindle pleasures. Highly recommended.
1441870008|4.0|Although popular, I didn't think I would like this all that well.  Too hipster, too modern for my tastes.  It turned out to be one of the more entertaining audio books I've heard in the last couple of years.  The reader does a great job and there aren't any lulls.  Not a lot of character development compared to other titles in the genre, but the introduction of new characters keeps things moving along.  Ready for book 2.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Without a doubt this was the best show to be cancelled without a fair chance but I can't call it the best show ever with so few episodes.  I have no doubt it's poor ratings were due to the lousy job Fox did promoting it which is one reason I did not see the show when it originally aired.  In fact I saw Serenity first which I enjoyed far more after watching the series on DVD and becoming more familiar with the wonderful cast of characters.  Too bad the movie did not fare well enough for sequels.
B002KV4NTQ|5.0|This is by far my favorite Rolling Stones album. I wish Mick Taylor would have stayed with the band as some of their best music was made when he was with them. Sway, Moonlight Mile, and Dead flowers. Great stuff.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is a wonderful app.  I love that I could create a magazine that meets my every need.  Sort of a cross between Vanity Fair, Time, and Atlantic Monthly.  I can have current news from multiple sources which gives me a better look at what is going on in the world and I can read my favorite reporters.  LOVE THIS APP.  I only have one criticism it is not as user friendly as it could be when it comes to eliminating content.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I'm a big fan of Paul and will buy anything he puts out, but I'll admit you never know what you'll get with him, case in point, his prior album Kisses on the Bottom.  I know he's a living legend and can pretty much do no wrong, and this album probably classifies as an excellent something like jazz, but to most McCartney fans it was a snooze fest.  After listening to New it's apparent that Paul has recently tapped into a new vein of creativity that he's always capable of.  This is his best since Flaming Pie, which was his last awesome album from the 90's.  So if his last few albums haven't done anything for you, then pick this up and Paul will be redeemed.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I loved this ebook. It is simple, address every problem and give solution for everything following a plan.<br /><br />Some books get lost on details and sometimes gives you information that you don't want, or overcomplicate things... Not the case with this, it is direct.<br /><br />After just one week I made more progress than months before.
0992251656|5.0|12 years after airing the original series, and still several since the movie, this series is still churning out quality products.  While those who have not seen Firefly can still play and enjoy this game, this is definitely a game for the fans.  You pick a ship (all four of them fireflies) and a captain, then traipse around the 'verse, taking jobs (legal or otherwise), collecting crew and equipment, and eventually complete the story mission to win the game (among them, a scenario called \\"King of All Londinium\\" where you have to steal the 'shiny hat').  Before you ask, yes, it is technically possible (though difficult) to snag the Serenity and build its entire crew, including notable items, such as 'Vera.'<br /><br />Although the learning curve isn't exactly friendly to novices, one game should be able to teach you the rules, and there is a solo mode that helps with this.  Setup should take no longer than Monopoly, with a full game taking anywhere from 2 to 4 hours, depending on newness of the players, aggression, and the scenario chosen.  The excitement doesn't let up, as the rules allow for theft, smuggling, run-ins with the law (interesting with your variable legal status), reavers, plain ole' deliveries, and even a mechanic for doing odd jobs.  There are also (simple) mechanics for reputation, morality, and wanted crew members.  This is a great buy if you are a fan of board games or Firefly, and a must own if you are both.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Hopefully I can clear up some one star ratings concerning internet and precedence.<br />This is a good simple linear calculator. It does not need the internet to work. A linear calculator performs the operations as you enter the numbers and press the operand. They do not have internal logic. This calculator works the same as a simple hand held calculator from Walmart. The operator must enter the numbers in the order of precedence that he wants.<br /><br />This is a good calculator for doing taxes, checking grocery lists etc. It has a few advanced functions for pi, sq root and some others. It also has a nice clean interface, large visible buttons and all in all is a very nice calculator.  a very nice free app of the day. I would have given it 5 stars but I like Calculator Pal a little better.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I wasted my money.  In order to get it to work it required I down loaded apps. that were not accepted by my Kindle.  I have given it to my nephew and he also has had problems getting it to work on his television.

Loved to get the monthly free puzzle a day also. Really miss this app hope it gets fixed soon! if it gets fixed it will be 5 stars again.<br />OK i have now revised my review. The have fixed the force close bug and it runs great. Only wish the had more free puzzle packs to choose from- even tho the ones the do have for sale are not very expensive.

B00DP4M6FK|5.0|Their first album, simply entitled Yes, was released in that crucial year of the Moon and Woodstock: 1969. Rock was in ferment, a period of awesome creativity, experimentation and heightened expressiveness. Although it was a crowded field, there were a few artists who stood out as historically important from the first. 1969 lofted Led Zeppelin, Crosby Stills and Nash, Rod Stewart, the Allman Brothers Band, Black Sabbath, Neil Young and Crazy Horse, Hall and Oates as well as Yes, just to name a few. With the release of Yes, the band revealed itself as masters of complex, polyphonic Rock that featured brilliant instrumental work and stunning vocals. Yes were the first of the as yet unnamed \\"Progressive Rock\\" groups (Genesis and Emerson, Lake and Palmer weren't formed until the following year). With their first album a new genre and several sub-genres were created. The importance of the band cannot be overstated.<br /><br />Listening to all 13 albums released by Yes between 1969 and 1987 I am struck by how their career exhibited a striking arc initiated by their absolute peak of perfection between 1969 and 1972 and their first 5 albums. This was followed by a progressive decline in creativity that began in 1973 with their sixth album Tales of Topographic Oceans and the onset of a series of personnel changes that had a deep impact on the band. There was a secondary peak in the 1980s that featured a pop oriented sound which was phenomenally successful: their 1983 album 90125 was triple platinum in the U.S. Although I am a huge fan of early Yes, I can appreciate their later work, at least in parts.<br /><br />High Vibration is a limited edition 16 SACD box set, featuring the 13 albums released by Yes between 1969 and 1987 and including the live album \\"Yessongs\\" as well as a bonus disc. The collection also includes an informative 200 page book that offers a history of the band, background information about its members, photos, a discussion of each recording and pertinent discographic data. The remastered DSD sound for both the SACD and the standard redbook CD layers is stunning in its clarity. I can hear levels of detail in the complex instrumental and vocal arrangements that have never been revealed before. Vocal textures have an almost satiny smoothness and refinement that must be heard to be appreciated. The band's multi-layered instrumental work has a Classical music intricacy and sophistication coupled with a Jazzy rhythmic excitement and funkiness that sounds timeless. Both qualities are accentuated by the brilliance of the DSD remastered recordings. Every album sounds great, with the newer recordings obviously having a more modern urgency and presence. The set contains the following:<br /><br />1969 Yes<br />1970 Time And A Word<br />1971 Fragile<br />1971 The Yes Album<br />1972 Close To The Edge<br />1973 Tales From Topographic Oceans 2CD<br />1973 Yessongs 2CD<br />1974 Relayer<br />1977 Going For The One<br />1978 Tormato<br />1980 Drama<br />1983 90125<br />1987 Big Generator<br />2013 Bonus Disc of Rarities<br /><br />This is a very pricey box set, designed for those who really love the band and feel the need to hear them in the finest high-resolution sound. High Vibration delivers on that promise, so if you come under the heading of a Yes aficionado who is well-heeled enough to afford this collection, I promise you that you will not be disappointed.

B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|I love the sound of these cds. The music took me by surprise considering most songs were not Dylan songs and were not highly praised when first released over forty years ago. I really liked this bootleg! Dylan did a great job interpreting these songs.to his style.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|It was a really enjoyable read. Kinda like if Twilight took place at Hogwarts. If you're looking for some book candy I recommend it!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|As in his other books, Hosseini explores relationships through time, creating beautiful metaphors to capture the feelings of his characters - pain, loss, happiness, loneliness, grief, fear, regret. I greatly enjoy his use of language as well as the depth of his characters, and the movement of the story through other places as well as time. I recommend this novel and look forward to Housseini's next one.

B004X6PRO6|4.0|Whether or not it's historically true, a warning or a metaphor, this engrossing tale of life in North Korea can turn one's understanding of world events and human perception on its head. The cleverly constructed writing disorients, engages and enlightens; what a literary trip!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|At first I wasn't sure what to think of this book but the more I read the more I wanted to find out what was next.  Very well written and an interesting story overall.  Definitely recommend reading it.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|I didn't know Grisham wrote kids books- know I know.  For a kids book it was OK. The series appears to be a &#34;Nancy Drew&#34; knockoff.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|A welcome return to King's scary style.  Sure missed those faced- paced, page- turners.  Dr. Sleep was a great read and is highly recommended.  That coming from one who loved The Shining and his older stories but could not even finish &#34; Under the Dome.&#34;
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Enjoyed the ride. It was a funny film that was full of action. Of course I have always loved Bruce Willis.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. I read it at least three times a year, and every time it feels like new- the plot is always fresh, and there is always something new to notice. I would highly encourage anyone who enjoys reading light-hearted fantasy novels to read it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was good and i liked it good story line and quite thrilling i recomend this to everyone please read
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep was a great sequel to The Shinning. Just enough horror and gore, with a splash of heart and heartache, made for a great Stephen King novel. Would recommend to any King fans, old or new. If you hadn't read the Shinning, or at least watched the movie(s), you should still be able to follow along pretty well.
067031255X|5.0|I have purchased many different figure drawing books over the past decade and this one is by far the best.  Lots of valuable information that is broken down in a way that artists can easily digest.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|It takes me back to the movie which I loved.  I like the slow but steady pace of this movie.  I loved the anticipation, the scenery and the music takes me back there. Something so calming even though the story is dark, there is a realism in the emotions the characters go through and then in the end the movie ends on a good, hopeful note.
B00EQRPFGC|4.0|I think John legion had out some his self with this song it is so very sexy and romantic I love it
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|I wasn't impressed with the graphics. But, if you liked Lost City you'll like this. The help system is strange too but to each his own.
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|I'd honestly recommend this product to just about anyone. It's a great story and a fun watch. The second season was an ok one kind of boring but this one was great.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Very enlightening to read the perspective from a young girl. In many ways a typical girl of her age and at the same time mature and brave way beyond.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was not what I expected, meaning it was different from other books I've read. Would recommend it to my friends to read.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|this movie claims to be about magicians but it's just cgi and is focused on shocking you with nonsense without a good explanation. I find myself not caring about any of the characters, not the end goal, and the revelations are designed to confuse you and have no basis in reality. The Prestige is a far better version of this movie.
B004I744AS|5.0|Great app! I am learning new words, old history, daily horoscope and games every day! Highly Recommended for a smart future!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love this ladies writing. You just never know where its going. Loved it.  I have read the whole series and would recommend them to anyone.  Rhonda
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love love love this game!!!!! Takes awhile to load but worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get it know before it cost money!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved it so unbelievably much. Though I found that my heart aches a little more and tears fall, I can not help but love it all the same. This was not just some heartbreaking tragedy but rather a story where you learn. You make connections that deeply move the soul and you grow from everything in this. That is why I recommend this book. Not because it is an amazing story which it no doubt is, but rather, you grow and suddenly your world is just a little different, possibly clearer.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Kudos to author for such  brilliant ideas that are backed up with fun to do experiments , written in a easy to follow format .Highly recommended
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesomely Sweet game. I only wish I had come up with it!! Everyone I know indulge s in this game. It is truly addictive fun.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I started reading Stephen King, as a kid, back in the 70s. Ever since then, i've been chasing the original \\"fascination scare hit\\" I used to get reading his stories.  I think the last good book I read by him was \\"IT\\".  I've started other books, but never finished them -- the guy spends too much time going off on tangents and stories lose their pace.<br /><br />This book is different. I finished it in a couple of  nights; it wasn't overdone and was an exciting (but not really scary) read.  \\"Dr. Sleep\\" might not be his best book, but it is his best since the 80s (just my opinion).
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It wasn't too easy and had a great story line to keep you interested. I would highly recommend to anyone that likes story games. Great job g5!!  Looking forward to the sequel!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great sci-fi for the consumer.  I really enjoy the reality that they propel through space without any noise, after all it is a vacuum.<br />Great characters and good action plus the plot leads to the movie Serenity.<br />Everyone agrees it was a mistake to cancel this series.
0765367351|5.0|Not much to say, if you liked the game you will really like the book. It really helped me to understand much more what happened on Rapture.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I was so excited that my favorite author was putting out a new book.  The beginning was classic SK but the True Knot RV traveling ghoul thing was ridiculous & not even scary; big disappointment .
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was one of the best Percy Jackson books ever its thrilling, scary,and suspenseful. If you like Percy Jackson you'll love this book
B00FPH6M82|4.0|This movie has a decent story, great special effects.  Will Smith plays the role in such a dead pan way I'm really glad he is not the prime role.  His son, Jaden, does a decent job of acting, but no Oscars here for either.<br /><br />Good movie to kill an hour or so.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very helpful app.  You can not only check the weather where you are but wear you are travelling.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app! I usually keep a small calculator in my bag but having<br />access to one on my kindle has taken its place! Great for business, schoolwork, and when you just need to make  a quick calculation.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game! I have played for quite awhile and not had to purchase anything. Would highly recommend! I will be trying others from this developer.
B0039208CG|4.0|I have to admit that this is what a comic book version of Batman would be like in a movie.  But despite its flaws, I consider this to be a guilty pleasure for me.  I just can't help it.  This movie just has a place in my heart.<br /><br />Okay, to explain what I mean, lets go over how the movie is and I promise to keep my spoilers to a minimum.<br /><br />Before we go into this movie, lets review the first two movies that were presented.  The very first movie in the franchise was &#34;Batman&#34; (obviously), which was released in 1989 and was a directed by the legendary Tim Burton.  Thanks to the dark theme of the story and Michael Keaton's performance as Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, the movie was a huge hit.  The second movie. &#34;Batman Returns&#34;, was released in 1992, with both Burton and Keaton returning.  Like the first movie, it was dark and Keaton was praised once again as Bruce.  The only problem was that the movie was more for adults and was a little too dark.  Warner Bros. decided to do a third movie, this time with a new director, one who could present a more child-friendly movie for kids.  With Burton and Keaton not returning, Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer took their places as director and as Bruce Wayne.  Now with that said lets move into the third movie and see how well it does.<br /><br />To start off, this movie has a place in heart because it was the very first live-action Batman film I have ever seen.  It caught my attention and allowed me to enjoy Batman, along with the villains he faced.  This is more of a guilty pleasure, but hey, we all have those.<br /><br />The graphics are okay and not that bad, considering it could be worse.  The music was epic and it felt more like Batman, just without the dark atmosphere to it.  The action was great and provided the type of stuff that kids like.  The atmosphere of the storyline was more light, but it did have a little bit of dark to it as well.<br /><br />Val Kilmer may not be Michael Keaton, but he isn't that bad as Bruce Wayne.  However, it was hard to identity with him and to see the pain that he is in.  Sure, we can see it in his memories, but it is hard to actually see the pain in his performance.  Not to mention that sometimes it is hard to take him seriously in that costume.  The villains are done very nicely too.  Jim Carrey does an amazing job as the Riddler, bringing the character to life and actually bringing out the funny side to him as well, not to mention the killer side too.  I remember laughing at some of his jokes and stunts.  Tommy Lee Jones does an okay job as Two-Face (although Aaron Eckhart did better in &#34;The Dark Knight&#34;), but I had a hard time taking him seriously with that purple side of his face.  However, despite that, I still thought his &#34;crazy&#34; side was pretty entertaining and fun to see.  Seeing Robin enter the world of Batman was amazing addition to the series.  I love how he is a teenager, instead of the small kid from the comics.  Not to mention that he is badass in the movie as well.  Heck, even his costume is upgraded to look badass and awesome.  Nicole Kidman does a sexy job at playing Dr. Chase Meridian, the love interest for both Batman and Bruce Wayne.  Unlike other love interests from the other two movies, this one actually seemed to fit the bill for Bruce.  And as always, Michael Gough does very well as Alfred Pennyworth.<br /><br />Now, is this movie as good as the previous movies from before.  In a way, &#34;yes&#34;.  But when it comes right down to the actual story of Batman, the older ones and the Nolan versions do better.  But despite all of that, I say that this movie makes a great children's movie and is a good guilty pleasure to have.<br /><br />I say buy it.  But only do it for the family and for your kids (if you have any).
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I like this book but I didn't love it it didn't grab me like the shining did it was almost predictable almost there were a few twisted I didn't see coming but nonetheless Master Stephen King is just that the master will always love is work now let's get on to those Dark Tower movie Steve

B006LSZECO|3.0|I rated this book a three because I hated the ending.  I did like the writing style, the story line was good and drew you in, but at the end I was so disappointed. (Plus, I think the sexual contents where a bit over the top for me.  Ugh!)

B00003CX8Y|5.0|My daughter got a part in the school play at school which was Disney's Beauty and the Beast and we thought if she watched the movie it would help.  I could not find it any where and as usual Amazon saved me! We love everything Disney and was thrilled she got a small part in the play!
B0074QGGK6|3.0|This book is good to flip through and get your creative juices started. The concepts give you permission to look at the world differently. Take and it and start your own manifesto.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|This is a good book about the history & times of this era.  I have read other professor's books and research on the subject that differ.  It is important to read many books of this nature by several well versed authors to keep this in perspective.  However, it is a good book and should be read by most Christan's.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very much enjoyed this book. It was very hard to put it down. I would definitely recommend. Amazon says I need to use more words Iin my review. So there you have it.
B0055MBQOM|1.0|We tried to use this in our studio on about 9 different monitors, including some LCD, LED, Laptop, Retina, etc. I upgraded to the 1iDisplay pro. Do yourself a favor and get the pro, so much better.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|Enjoyed the previous four seasons and moving on to season five.  Really enjoy the storylines; these women can really get themselves in to precarious, yet humorous situations.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This will be one of my all time favorite books. Can't wait to read th rest of the series in awe
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I keep logging on for more. Very addictive. Challenges your mind.  Sometimes frustrating. But a good way to pass the time.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I would have really enjoyed this game, but I kept flipping over. Even after I did some upgrading. I got it for my friends son, he go frustrated and put it down.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|it was a great book, i enjoyed it more than the tv show. i was really interested and by each chapter I was hooked on ans couldn't stop reading.
B008JFUPZI|3.0|Based on a Dark Horse Entertainment comic book by Peter M. Lenkov, \\"R.I.P.D\\" looks like a \\"Men in Black\\" with a twist. One rookie cop teams up with his veteran partner, tracking down the \\"monsters\\" in the human's world. The difference is, all \\"R.I.P.D\\" officers are dead people.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds is a young Boston cop Nick Walker who gets killed during a raid on a warehouse. In the afterlife he is recruited by Mildred Proctor (Mary-Louise Parker), head of the Boston division of the Rest in Peace Department, and starts working with a former 19th century US marshal Roycephus Pulsipher (Jeff Bridges).<br /><br />So far the story is not bad. But the film suddenly loses momentum there. Capturing (or hunting down) CG-created \\"Deados \\"is not interesting enough. The main plot needs something more than Kevin Bacon's antagonist and the secrets of \\"gold.\\" The \\"Ghost\\"-like subplot about Nick's wife Julia (Stephanie Szostak) is weak.<br /><br />Actors all did great jobs. Bridges and Reynolds are just terrific. Watching deadpan Mary-Louise Parker is really fun. It is just that director Robert Schwentke (\\"Flightplan\\" \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" \\"Red\\") doesn't seem to know where the story should be going.<br /><br />The movie is good. Just good. But we know this could have been much more fun, and those characters deserve a much better story.
B000BGH22W|2.0|I know I'm a little late to the party on this one -- I only recently got around to buying this soundtrack.  Why?  Because there were very few moments in the movie that I realized there was a score underneath. Whereas Williams' music is often the selling point in any scene (and sometimes an entire movie, like E.T.), Doyle did nothing for me for most of the scenes.  Yeah, he managed to sneak in an Irish Jig during the Quidditch World Cup, and somewhere in the movie he almost used a tiny fraction of one of the themes that Williams established, but beyond that, his music had little, if nothing to do with the magic of Harry Potter.  This is why I never got around to wanting this album.  THIS is why my rating on this is so low.  The music had no &#34;magic&#34; to it, and failed to draw me in.<br /><br />If I were to listen to this soundtrack without knowing it was for Harry Potter, I would have loved it!  I'm a sucker for music that brings images of tall ships on the high seas, and that is exactly what nearly every track of this album is like.  It's beautiful, it's evocative, I can almost feel the spray of saltwater on my face.  And then I look at the playlist and see the title Harry Potter and I have to double-check that I'm listening to the same album.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is one of the loveliest DVDs ever.  I showed it every winter to my classes in NYC public schools and even the behavior problems sat still the entire time.  There are only a few minutes of narration at the start and then the rest is picture/music.  It is the story of a boy and his snowman and their adventures when the snowman comes alive at the stroke of midnight.  Beautiful illustrations and the music is wonderful (George Winston on piano).  My grandkids love it too.  We often dance together to the Scottish music at the snowman's party.  So much fun for them.  Highly recommend this DVD for the winter holidays.  Makes a terrific gift.
B008Y212PI|4.0|A couple of the puzzles towards the end get a bit difficult but nothing that can't be solved.  Four stars.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|It was an interesting continuation of the previous one.  I enjoyed the reintroduction of Kahn very much and am an admirer of Benedict Cumberbatch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally! Well, it it as about time. What took so long for Amazon to get with the program? Love/Hate Candy Crush (if you've been playing long enough, then you know what I mean). :)
B008220BP2|5.0|movie was recommended by second oldest daughter :)<br /><br />so we gave it a try on net flix<br /><br />its a fun watch<br /><br />how often do the walking dead become a good guy<br /><br />give it a try
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Before I rent a movie I read some of the &#34;See All Of My Reviews&#34; of the 1 star ratings. You might learn more about the movie than you think and whether you will like it or not judging by their likes and dislikes.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|***SPOILER ALERT!!!***<br /><br />Superman is arguably the most iconic comic book hero in the world, and he has been for many years.  People all over the world know who he is.  Superman may be the only superhero who is not thought of as an American hero, but as a world hero.  Why is that?<br /><br />I collected comic books for over 15 years.  I grew up watching \\"The Adventures of Superman\\" and the Superman movies in the 70s and 80s.  No other hero embodies what it means to be a hero more than Superman.  He embodies it so much that he has often been ridiculed over the years for being cheesy, a boy-scout, or just plain boring.  Superman embodies all that is good...so much so that over the last 35 years, the writers have even endowed him with a \\"Messiah-complex.\\"  We can always trust Superman to do the right thing when it comes to the safety and welfare of others.  These have been timeless qualities that make him who he is, as much as brooding and incredible deductive reasoning make Batman who he is.<br /><br />\\"Man of Steel\\" attempts to change much of Superman's character.  The writers are trying desperately to make Superman more realistic and gritty; more of what they feel the world wants Superman to be.  I am a Peace Corps volunteer in Macedonia.  I lost count of how many people here, in this small country, have seen the film and asked me, \\"why did they change him?  That isn't Superman.\\"  One thing that I liked about the film was that the \\"S\\" symbol is defined as \\"hope.\\"  And that is the one thing that Superman has always meant to so many people.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Man of Steel\\" gives us a Superman film that is practically all flash and very little substance.  Given the incredible cast that they had to work with, I was disappointed in how little time and development is given to Clark, Lois, Perry, and others.<br /><br />We get a fairly impressive scene on Krypton.  No longer is Krypton a crystallized world, but one of metal and technology.  The writers decide to take a page out of the \\"Matrix\\" playbook as people on Krypton are not born, but grown.  Kal-El (referred to laughably as Kal, which makes me think of Titanic), is the first naturally born Kryptonian in thousands of years.  As we know, Kal-El is sent to earth as the planet explodes, but not before Zod and his minions are banished and the explosion of Krypton frees them.<br /><br />The film opens with Clark wandering around in the north somewhere.  Yes, he leaves his mother behind on the farm.  We aren't given much of an explanation as to why.  Jonathan Kent has all but instilled a sense of paranoia within Clark; so much so that Jonathan sacrifices his life to preserve Clark's secret.  This is done is a very implausible manner.  Jonathan is about to be killed by a tornado (notice that his hair doesn't even move when he's within a few hundred feet of it!), and Clark stands by and watches, even though Jonathan does hold up his hand and shakes his head.  I haven't seen a version of Clark Kent, until now, who would stand idly by and watch his own father be killed.  In fact, I don't know many people who would do this, if they felt that they had the chance to save a loved one; secret be damned.  Not to mention that Clark has super-speed and could have saved Jonathan without anyone seeing him.<br /><br />Lois Lane is given an assignment in the north to cover a scientific-military operation.  She sees Clark in the distance and wanders out in -40 degree weather without a hat or facial protection.  I have been in temperatures that low before, and your ears would be frost-bitten within ten minutes, and Lois isn't even shivering.  Just like that, she happens upon a large alien craft where Clark is finally introduced to Jor-El.  Naturally, Clark ends up having to save her life when Kryptonian defenses see Lois as an intruder and attempt to kill her.  We have a couple of minutes of Lois & Clark time before we shift the story again.<br /><br />Virtually the entire second-half of the film is a CGI-action fest (which is okay at best).  Zod and his minions (easily over 20) come looking for Kal-El and decide to make Earth their new utopia.  Here is where things really get pushed over the edge.  Up until now, we have had little character development and suddenly Superman who has just mastered flying, is thrown into the frying pan as a large invasion force descends upon the Earth.  The amount of destruction and deaths are higher than in any other Superman feature film.  I also lost count of the number of times Superman would hit one Kryptonian fifty feet above the ground, sail for a few miles, and then back the other way we come.  Zod, a great military general, only allows two other Kryptonians to attack Superman, when he could send over a dozen of his people to different points on the globe and thus, incapacitate Superman's ability to save the planet.<br /><br />The action scenes, frankly, were not that impressive to me.  After a few times of people slamming into each other and through buildings, it became tedious.  Frankly, I wasn't emotionally invested in Superman.  There wasn't enough character development for me to care.  Lois, a reporter, is even given a military mission.  I guess there weren't any military personnel qualified to do it; to put a Kryptonian computerized device into a slot.<br /><br />I also wish the flying scenes were better.  Superman and Superman II still have the best flying sequences of any Superman film, and there was no CGI.  Christopher Reeve contorted and turned his body to mimic flying.  We see Henry Cavill straight on a few times and then these fast, distant fly-bys.<br /><br />I, like many others, also have a problem with Superman's \\"killing\\" scene.  Had there been no other options, I might have considered that Superman had no choice.  But that isn't the case here.  He could have turned Zod's head in a safer direction (if you're strong enough to break someone's neck, then you can turn their head), or he could have grabbed him and flown him out of the train station.  In other words, he had options.  And even though Superman is overcome with grief for his action, it simply doesn't work.<br /><br />If you're going to do a good Superman film, then you first have to know the character.  Zack Snyder and the writers clearly don't.  They tried to change and mold an iconic character to make him relevant (in their minds) to today's world.  For me, it didn't work.  We are given a transformers-type action fest that detracts from the story rather than enhance it.<br /><br />Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane, and Kevin Costner are given very little screen time. Cavill makes the most of what little time he does have.  Michael Shannon's Zod is the best and most developed character of the film along with Russell Crowe's Jor-El.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to seeing this film, based on what I saw in the trailers.  And again, I was disappointed that a movie that is nearly two and a half hours long, failed to give me a Superman and characters that I care about.  If you can't do some character development and go deeper within that amount of time, then as a writer, you might want to look into a new profession.<br /><br />I will say that the music in this film is pretty good, but it's hard to top the epic score of John Williams that exemplifies power, greatness, and hope.<br /><br />For now, I will stick with Superman I & II.  They may be older films, but they are still classic films that work today and give us the Superman that most of us know and love.  Perhaps someday, we'll get a film that does justice to the world's greatest superhero.f the film is a CGI-action fest (which is okay at best).

B00FMZ22CM|1.0|I bought this for my Kindle Fire HD.  Unfortunately, as with many other apps, it does not work on Kindle Fire HD.  This is yet another shortcoming of the Kindle Fire HD to be added to the fact that voice recognition apps and bar code reading apps are incompatible.  I am sorry to say that I regret buying the Kindle FireHD.  I bought it because of the Amazon name and service reputation.  I am a big fan of Amazon's quality service and products.  In this case, however, they let their customers down on the KIndle Fire HD primarily because of the incompatibility issues, but also due to the poor quality of the Silk browser.  To add insult to injury, the Kindle help representatives who are often unaware of these incompatibilities and send Kindle owners on a wild goose chase attempting to load apps that will simply not play on Kindle.  I am sorry to say that Amazon may have hurt their own reputation with the Kindle Fire HD.
