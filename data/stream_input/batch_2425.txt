B008220DIC|5.0|This is a masterpiece and I don't even like Paul Thomas Anderson that much. But his skills as a filmmaker cannot be ignored. He is brilliant and yes probably a genius. Doesn't mean you have to like his work, though. That said this film is critical of a certain, um, organization that has been jumping on a couch up and down in anger over this film if you get my drift. So the unusually massive amount of One Star Reviews should be taken with a grain of salt. If it wasn't for DDL Joaquin Phoenix would or should have cruised to an Oscar for one of the GREATEST performances in screen history.<br /><br />And pints for Johnny Greenwood of Radiohead's outstanding score.
0425252868|5.0|Very well written recount of an incredible encounter during the war. The before and after are truly heartwarming and provocative. Particularly meaningful to me as my dad was a B-17 pilot at Kimbolton in the same unit as Charles Brown. Dad was shot down and interned as a POW a month prior to Charles Brown's mission. Dad would never talk about his war experiences, but now I have a clearer picture of what he went through in his four missions. True patriots on both sides. Many thanks to the authors.
B00338QENI|5.0|Read for book club. Loved the history. Very interesting and thought provoking subject. Would highly recommend for high school readers on up
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|watched this movie several times and enjoyed each time I watched it. It is a must watch and must have in my personal collection. Lots of action, new take on the typical love story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are not enough words that can describe the journey this book takes you on.  It is an AMAZING story told perfectly - nothing out there compares.  I finished this book about a month ago and still find myself thinking of the characters and story.  Its hard to find another book that will fill me up like this one did.  This story made me laugh, smile, and cry (like a baby).  Its a love story with a twist that ends perfectly under the night sky!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Hilarious play on monsters that were scary when we were growing up. I watched it with my 9 year old about 5 times, and I laughed equally as much as she did :-) highly recommend!
B00A2FSXHK|5.0|Good sci fi movie. Action packed. Kept me interested.  Someone told me to rent this and it was worth te $3 to watch it
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|My daughter LOVES these &#34;Step Up&#34; movies, but she is 9 years old... My perspective is that the acting sucks...but the dancing is AWESOME!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Brandon Sanderson finished Robert Jordan's masterpiece with style. Not too long not too short. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has read the rest of this great series.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Love the main characters, and it was a decent movie. A good way to spend a lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoon but certainly glad I did not pay for it.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Love this movie can't wait for them to make another one. The animation is so nicely done in some parts you would think its a real actor.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's the Rising is a good album to listen to in wake of Boston― it's 9-11-01 response literature, like Foo Fighters' In Your Honor, like NAS' Stillmatic.  Released in 2002, this album is the Boss dealing with the damage done to his community.  He knows what New Jersians and New Yorkers want to hear, so he get's back with E street and makes a very tender, healing album.<br /><br />Into the Fire is a pretty obvious reference to firefighters and danger.  Empty Sky is a scary song to me.  Some of you youngsters won't remember, but I was in D.C. that September.  The most threatening part for me was not hearing planes in the sky.  It was a terrifying silence.  That's when they win, when we shut down.<br /><br />Mary's Place is the crux of the album, for me.  This is the Boss' answer to terror: have a party.  Not a celebration, but the kind of party were you go to the local watering hole, where you know everybody, and can be yourself.  You're Missing immediately follows, a vulnerable, tender eulogy to the fallen.  I think the Rising was a very powerful message for us to hear at that time.  They can strike us down, but we will always Rise.  That is the American spirit, to me, undefeatiblility.  Flags don't make a dang difference, sympathies don't, either.  What we got― that they can never take away from us― is our artists, telling us what we need to hear, egging us on, to stand back up on our feet.  And we will never stay down for long.<br /><br />[...]
B0050DIWFC|4.0|An all around good read, the reader thinks they have figured out the ending and are then thrown another twist.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence did not deserve Best Actress from the Academy for this role. She is a terrible actress. She was the weakest link of the whole film. The rest of the film was pretty good, aside from the superficial take on mental illness. It actually had a story, a plot and didn't take itself seriously. If a better actress had played Lawrence, this movie could have been knocked out of the park.
B001PL4HZW|4.0|I collect all types of music fits into my collection for when I'm driving its my alone time cannot be told to turn it off or have my car unpluged like a player
B00CCZ4BFQ|5.0|The triumph return of Tom Keifer (and possibly Cinderella somewhere down the road???) is nothing less than a great bluesy-rock album that any fan of good music will instantly connect with and love. From rockers like Solid Ground, Cold Day In Hell and Ain't That A Bitch to the more mellow feel of A Different Light and The Flower Song, Keifer's vocal performance does not miss a note. Definitely recommend this album to anyone who wants to just kick back and rock out to some great tunes!!!!
B007RCJNDE|5.0|I've been waiting many years for this book so that I could finally sit down and re-read the entire series in one go. It took me a few months, but what a ride! The middle books were a bit weak, but when Sanderson took over he really brought it back on track, and somehow managed to retain Jordan's tone while mitigating many of the annoying aspects.<br /><br />This book is all about the Last Battle. There isn't much in the way of character development; it's almost non-stop action the whole way through. Not every loose end is tied up, and there remain question marks about the future, but nonetheless it is a satisfying climax to a mammoth series.
0345525558|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and found it<br />believable that  through a series of disappointments in her life<br />the main character learned to cope by relying only on herself. I'm not sure<br />that in real life people would've kept trying with her but I would like to believe it<br />is so. I loved the theme of the language of flowers and found myself doing some of my own<br />investigation on different flowers and plants.
0143122916|4.0|I wanted to learn more about North Korea to better understand why they are the poorest and most  cruel country in the world. Very good read. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B008EKMB82|4.0|The two parallel stories are an excellent read. Some seems like an autobiography of the author and other parts are mystical. I had some difficulties with the metaphysical concepts, but didn't think that it was a negative while reading the book. I would recommend it.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Insightful and thought-provoking.  Enjoyed the development of the characters and the unlikely but amusing portrayal of pilgrim's progress.  Gave it as a hard-copy gift that was in turn well-received.
B007SGM084|5.0|I totally didn't know what to expect when I started this book, it is explicit but wonderfully written! Many parts made me blush but they who story sucked me in, I could not get enough. I read the whole series in a few days.
B007G92QGO|4.0|...but will do so now.  This was well-written in the genre of We Have to Talk About Kevin and diaplays some of the same concerning parenting issues of Lionel Shriver's book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a huge fan of dystopian fiction. This collection is now in my top 5. My biggest complaint is that this book caused my performance at work to suffer. After I started reading it, I couldn't put it down, I would stay up into the wee hours of the morning reading. After getting only a few hours of sleep I would go to work tired and distracted with thoughts of what would happen next in Wool. It is bittersweet that there is an end to this series. I am happy to be getting more sleep, but now I crave more Wool...
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Obvious what the ending will be from the outset but that was OK - the journey to the ending was entertaining and good fun.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm almost 30 and remember friends in high school recommending this book. I never did and regret it now. This was an amazing read.
158270208X|5.0|I really thought there was going to be more to it.. but it was a great journal.. unfortunately it was ruined when our home flooded.
1616550414|5.0|The book come with excellent paper and a very good cover. Many curiosities of skyward sword, but I expected more curiosities about other games than skyward sword.
1439181780|5.0|the book is great.. everyone needs positive thinking and positive being... adding this line of thought in with our Christian views and lifestyle has really worked for us. I think everyone needs a copy of this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fun read!  Great story to have on the Kindle for an airplane ride, or sitting in the car on a road trip,
B00CBKVMG8|5.0|This is one of the best gangster movies I've seen. Great action, good actors and great story line.<br />I loved the movie.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|This movie and the dancing always sync together in every way you will find yourself spellbound  this series of movies is a must see for anyone who loves dancing movies
0780626494|5.0|I was more than happy to get the Blast From The Past DVD.  This is one of my favorites ande had it on VHS so am happy with my purchase.
B000I9UA8U|5.0|I had heard about The Full Monty for years, but had never gotten around to seeing it.  I expected to be funny, but I had no idea how good it would be.  I did not realize that it was a winner of both a BAFTA and an Academy Award.  It was actually nominated for the 1997 Best Picture in the Academy Awards, but lost to Titanic.  It's great; I highly recommend it.
B0097PW7H8|4.0|If you are looking to extend the life of your battery on your kindle, this app surely will help with that.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|Tried to open rebate form on Kindle. Nothing happen. Tried twice n/g. Maybe I did something wrong. Don't think so. Useless otherwise.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Clean, but 'dirty', in the way all good dramas should be. The only thing is that the writers may be a bit excessively into shock value by some seemingly non-sensical deaths of key characters.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Normally I don't Write Reviews but I felt I needed to for This... I had this pre-ordered, the 3D blu-ray with a digital copy.  I didn't pay much attention to it, just assuming it would include a 2D blu-ray, and all the special features like all 3D releases have in the past.  But today I just happened to look at my pre-orders, and I saw this had low reviews, so I looked closer and was shocked to see how barebones of a release this is, for the money.  I want both 2D and 3D together in one package.  Disney a had a for sure sale with me, but now I cancelled my order, and I don't see myself buying it until they fix this issue, or I might just buy it used someday down the road so they don't make any money off of me.  We need to show them that we're not going to take this kind of treatment for future releases!
B00992CF6W|5.0|buy this app it is awesome you will know why it is stuped that it is 6 dollers but it is worth it.<br />p
B007J4T2G8|5.0|With all the controversy over this book, I had to read it and see for myself what all the fuss was about.  I have never cared for reading paperback romance novels, but I was intrigued by all the press the book was getting.  I have to admit that I loved this book as well as the other two in the trilogy.  It took me by surprise that I found the book so erotic.  I had read articles and seen on TV many people who were put off by this.  I took everything into context from the author's perspective and thoroughly enjoyed the story.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The graphics are great, the game is fun, addictive.  Makes you laugh and giggle when you fall off the edge.  Great for every age.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|This book had so many twist and turns it kept my attention.  The detail on police investigation was a real learning experience.  The story almost felt real.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I guess you have to be a fan of thought provoking comedy to appreciate it.[[ASIN:B00BMT9SQA Guilt Trip]]
B0094M2SCI|3.0|Kate is hot, but she looks very goth in this vamp flick.  It has a matrix style and story mixed with Interview with a vampire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have the Bible app on my iPhone , kindle and my lap top. It makes no difference where I am I always have Gods Word with me.what I like most about this app is it comes in several versions and languages. It is ideal for those who don't like to read for it has different version in audio.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! Have I mentioned that I love it? We miss you Opie! And Jjax its always nice to see you ;)
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I rate this Bible okay was unable to use it  in church Sunday due too locked  internet at church. So it didn't. Do me any justice being free. Will still have to purchase one that works off line.…
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the historical accuracy and the drama of both the wealthy and the servants. It makes you truly understand what it was like to be a woman at that time or even the side as a servant. Very intriguing and addicting.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I chose this rating because I am very interested in the NDE. The author was very thorough in his descriptions of both places he visited.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|I have always liked the concept of worm whole travel through the universe. I have not seen all episodes yet. However, Stargate SG-1 Season 2 has not disappointed so far.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Well... this is a good book but WAY to long. So yea that is my review... bye for more... I am done
B001992NW4|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movie memories started with waiting in line to see THE EXORCIST while folks in surrounding office buildings yelled encouragement out of their windows.  This blu-ray edition is the best copy I've seen, and I loved the booklet as well.  It was interesting to see the Director's Cut which adds approximately 15 minutes to the original.  It's nice to have, and the extras are great; but, all things considered, I still prefer the original Theatrical Version for the most part.  What a great movie this is...still!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love Bruce Willis.  I have all of his movies. (Unfortunately most are on VHS). But RED has got to be one of the best.  It  cracks me up.  I have intorduced my young (26) god-daughter to it and now she's going through my entire collection.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Excellent daily reminder of what is truly important.  I define the word \\"success\\" as personal not monetary.  I read a few pages each morning to begin a more grounded, peaceful day.  Applies to all beliefs.
B00846REIS|5.0|Fun, easy read.  Unrealistic but women like them because they love the idea of a man who will change every part of himself in order to win her love.  Already read the second one, waiting for the third.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the game & I am addicted. Only issue is sometimes the game has a schism. I've recommended it to friends as well & I play it every day!
B003PWJS9Y|5.0|DEVO came on the scene when I was in high school.  Oh, I date myself!  I have been to their concerts and have some old &#34;vinyl&#34; laying around plus some CD's.  This album really embodies the DEVO sound but is modern.  I thoroughly enjoy this entire work..They still have it and for that we all benefit.
B00ACBN9CI|2.0|This is tough to play. The system has very sensitive controls which make game play a challenge and a little frustrating.
B005BUZJ6O|5.0|I think somebody at work sent me a link to them.  I am an amateur cellist and involved in a variety of playing arrangements, but mostly the classics.  I think it is great when artists break the mold and do something like this.  After watching a few videos on YouTube I purchased the album.  Wow, making the cello cool.  You guys rock and so does your music!  I have seen some videos of them playing classical works and they are certainly world class musicians.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This is comparable to Temple Run--it's an okay play. The Temple Run games are doing just fine. I recommend Joy Pet Joy Ride, now that's a fun game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of my all time favorites.  The characters are so replete with wit, I found myself laughing loudly.  I couldn't put this one down.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|If you on the go,this is best  way to find out fast what is what is the weather that day.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|visually stunning, very touching story line, I throughly enjoyed the movie.  I found the ending a bit strange, but overall a must see.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I really enjoy playing Mahjong on my Kindle.  This is the first paid app I have.  There is a lot of choices for design and complexities and it keeps the best time you achieve.  But on at least two occasions playing this, it suddenly stops and freezes.  I have to close it out and start again.  This has not happened to the free app I selected to play Mahjong.  But other than that glitch, I enjoy it very much.
B004132HZS|5.0|Got the DVDs fast, I am really enjoying watching them. I even have my Husband watching them with me. Can't wait to watch Season Two
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing game! So addictive and you just want to complete all the mission  and see what you hAve to do next.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am so hooked on Vince Flynn's books, they are addictive.  Finish one and looking for another.  Should make a movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome I play it all the time! And you would be amazed at what you can make and see.
B00B671VYU|5.0|This album was quite interesting. Unlike some albums, where, after the first listen, you love it, this album sneaks up on you. On the first listen, I shrugged and shelved it as run-of-the-mill Lordi. Get Heavy has always been a big favorite in my lineup, but after about the third listen, I realized that this album was amazing. Lyrically, Lordi still tells fun stories, ranging from outrageous tales about a cannibal heading to the electric chair, to the Grim Reaper playing him a song, to writing a scathing letter to a narcissistic fellow, and so on. Songs such as We're Not Bad for the Kids (We're Worse) and Horrifiction really define the album, with Candy for the Cannibal and The Riff providing incredibly catchy songs. I always find myself singing along. Have to say that Sincerely With Love kind of took me by surprise, since Lordi doesn't usually swear much. That said, it's still a catchy enough song, if a bit out of character. Overall, amazing album, still my favorite of the year (Device's self-titled debut takes a close second)
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|I remember hearing this CD when it first came out and how moved I was by the music and the lyrics. The riffs on some of these songs are so strong and Layne's voice is as strong as ever, this Deluxe version is a must have for any fan of AIC, since Layne's voice and Lyrics were the main force behind their music and this album and the included DVD in superior 5.1 surround sound captures Layne at his creative peak no doubt, and he did nothing of any real significance after this musical foray. The video is not the best on the second half, but the first half the video is decent, but it is the sound that really shines on the DVD. Whoever mixed this DVD did an excellent job since all of the players can be heard and with a great deal of clarity too I might add. Overall this is an excellent buy, but it would have been so much better if it had been put out in high definition 1080 progressive video with DTS-MA 5.1 surround sound, and hopefully one day Steven Wilson will mix this CD in the 5.1 DVD-AUDIO surround sound format.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|This is the best zz top album in years,probably since eliminator...the vocals are strained to say the least and the mastering is horrid but the music is first rate and a return to the blues based boogie without the drum machine and synthesizers...I didnt think they had it in them...bravo!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|The Following surprised me.  I didn't think I'd like it at first,  there is a lot of blood and gore, but the story is well crafted and the twists and turns of the plot keep you guessing.  Although some element are predictable,  there is enough plot line to keep you off balance.  And Kevin Bacon ... need there be more said?
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The kinky sex was too much for me. The best parts of the book were the emails that passed between the two main characters. It was the only time they seemed real to me, like they were really a couple.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It was a fun movie to watch! My niece is still too young to watch it, but she will enjoy it when she is old enough!
0062082353|5.0|This was a gift for someone, they really loved it, and now that the person is deceased, it means more to the<br />person that received it. He said the book was excellent reading.
B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|I'll be positive at first. This release grew on me. After subsequent listening, I upgraded from a 1-star to 2-star review LOL. This album (CD or digital) is boring, tiring, non-inspired and stolen from earlier songs. Bowie is stealing from an earlier edition of himself. The last gasps of a dying artist. Regurgitating bars of music in a urine-stinking alley rotting from corpses once youthful too many years ago. This ain't Rock-n-Roll, this is fossilized crap. LOL. I am a true Bowie fan who loves his old music. I would love his more recent music if it warranted the honor. But it doesn't. The king has no clothes. It takes courage to confess and witness the death of artistic ability. He called in his paramedics of the past to play on this album, but the illness he caught after China Girl (and some say was laying dormant after Scary Monsters) still persists. He has not enough air from his diaphragm when he sings on these songs. Like a hot air balloon without the air, this album never leaves the ground while its riders yearn to see the horizon while their heads are cast downward looking at their shoes in disappointment. And with little time remaining, their hopes fade along with their memory of better music. These are truly the days in which the music has died and the music critics no soul.
B003YBUSMW|1.0|The wheel would power on, but would not sync. Followed the instructions multiple times and read a ton of tech support forums to try and get it to sync properly. Tech support was sadly lacking.<br /><br />A complete disappointment, as I was really looking forward to finally getting a wheel for Forza 4. Will be avoiding Mad Catz products in the future.
0783225903|4.0|A wierd movie but very entertaining.  Its would be a good movie to watch with friends with some beer and chips.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|I love this show.  After the first episode I was hooked.  It's more than the sum of its parts.  It can make you question your ideas about good and evil and right and wrong.  How far would you go to make the world a safer place while receiving no recognition or reward?
B0051XQI84|5.0|This is a great film for kids or adults. It is very funny and will put you in a great mood.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|I lived in London a while ago and reminded me of all the nice cafes filled with delicious food! Especially love the scrumptious pictures of food.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Diamond Dash is a lot of fun. Fast action. Wish you could get more free lives instead of having to wait.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|Loved loved loved this game on iPhone but got an android and hate hate hate it now, I wont even play it..Hate playing on Facebook, doesn't work good at all and android is slow motion and delayed reaction timing issue so I don't play anymore ...wish I had my iPhone because I want to play
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark once  again doesn't disappoint her fans! I always look forward eagerly to her next book Didn't put it down til I finished.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Brilliant! I can not wait for Season 4! It's going to be a long hot summer without Rick and company!
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Perfect balance between philosophy and practicality or lack there of in memorizing. Worth reading and thinking about. Glad I read it
B005IQZB14|5.0|I found so much enjoyment in this book. The early telling of cancer, drugs, sex and young divorce were difficult. It evoked personal memories. Most readers have had their own struggles with these or similar issues. However, very few deal with their disappointment and loss by making an 1100-mile trek for which they are poorly prepared. Reading of Cheryl' s growth and acceptance of herself and her life's experiences was pure pleasure.
B005LAIH54|3.0|the movie was decent,  not as good as the first one, some of the parts of the movie had pretty bad graphics. knowing its hard to make a second movie like this. good try but i would pass. with the title of the movie wrath, i would expect more.
B001XUIBNO|4.0|Jack Nicholson looks so young but then this is now an old movie.  No problems watching it streaming over my Panasonic player
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|this was ok, but the original one was better, there are some dark spots on the movie that made it hard to see, for a remake I thought it would be more like the original one,
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|It has been my high pleasure to know Adam Brown's father and work on several projects with him so to get to read the story directly was a blessing. It was very humbling to think men like this always have our back.
B005LAIGW8|2.0|the movie isn't what I had expected to be. it didn't follow the first one, and I think if a second one was made it should have followed the first movie. Some parts of the movie should have been deleted.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|A real tear--jerker.  Intellectually I know it's fiction, but I find myself looking at animals with a whole new respect.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|great fun and colorful there is plenty of different things to do without using real money and the movement and art style is crisp and clear
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love Angry Bids, I have retired now and it fills some of my day. Hard to put down and recommend it to everyone
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Missions are cool,should be some more power-ups, and maybe other kinds of coins. But I like the game a lot I tried it once and haven't stopped since.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|I gave the movie 4 stars because of it´s overall tone and atmosphere (and because of the performances of the two girls, who were amazing), but I have to say that it has two major flaws in it. So it is a mixed bag to review, because I could have given everything from one to five stars. First: I don´t understand (like I didn´t back in the day when \\"Don´t be afraid of the dark\\" came out)why a guy like del Toro as an exec. producer always let the directors give away the look of the monster or mosnters at the first possible moment. Especially in Mama it would have served the movie well, if you would have seen a lot less of the entity of it´s titel, which would have hightened the suspens and terror a lot. Second: What kind of ending was this??? There where two or three possible endnings hidden in the subplots, but neither was chosen to give the film a decent ending, but maybe that´s the problem if you have 5 guys writing a screenplay that at the end no one knows anymore how to bring the movie to a satisfying conclusion for the audience. This could have been a masterpiece but unfortunately the chance was wasted, because of the two little mishaps I mentioned above.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Skyfall was a wonderfully entertaining movie. It was a fast paced, action packed movie that really showed that Daniel Craig is 'Bond'.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|I like James Bond movies, good entertainment, well made, can be seen more than one time.good for your collection<br />Buy from amazon. Excellent service
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|At first i did not like it but know i do.I like Pharrell Williams, to me he's a good artist.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addicted!<br />This app makes it easier to access Pinterest from my device. I can view, pin, and access links much easier with the app from my Fire than I could just loading it from the web on the Fire.
B005GVF95O|5.0|My 2 year old likes this app. She is just getting the hang of it and how to put the pieces together. There are a couple of puzzles that is only 1 thing, but there are a lot of them in the same puzzle. For example, there is one puzzle that has 5 animals and you have to find which animal goes where. Those helped the most in teaching her how to do it. Lots of different puzzles to choose from!
B0055JPM6I|5.0|Thought this was really funny. As a huge Danny McBride fan, he does not disappoint in this spoof. If you enjoy vulgar, off color humor - indulge..you'll be entertained for sure. If you are expecting a Princess Bride type flick..move on.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Great movie! Love Tom Cruise in almost everything he does. There is so much action in this movie so it should appeal to all action junkies. The fact that Tom Cruise does most all his own stunts is amazing. I loved the location of this movie. There was so much great scenery. I'll more than likely never get to go to these locations so I found that all so interesting. You'll be on the edge of your seat and you  won't be bored. One of the best in the Mission Impossible series.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Clancy has become one of those people that folks &#34;love to hate&#34;. Nothing will ever be as good as the early books as far as they are concerned. There is no question that the &#34;collaborative&#34; books aren't quite as complex as some of his earlier works, but they are still a good read and it's fun seeing the characters continue on through life. I enjoyed this book and will buy the next one. That says what's important as far as the author and his work are concerned, at least in my not-so-humble opinion.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This show definitely lives up to it reputation of being one of the best dramatic shows on TV. I can't wait for each weeks episodes.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Deserved to win Best Picture. I've seen all of the nominees and thought this or Django were the two best flicks overall with Lincoln and very close third.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I wore out my old copy so I needed to buy another one, who doesn't love Stevie wonder one the greats
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|We bought the whole season and watched it from the big computer screen. Towards the end of the series, we were interrupted by it needing to buffer but it gave us a heads up before hand. It wasn't a giant deal but slightly annoying.<br /><br />The whole series is great, my husband and I are both hooked on it and are awaiting season four.  The ending to this season was a disappointment but its understandable because something had to happen so season four could have a good story line.<br /><br />I'm happy we used Amazon!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Great graphics. Interesting puzzles. Unfortunately a bit short. Prefer a game to take more than a couple sittings but quite entertaining.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|There is an interruption in the sound loop every 30 seconds or so.  It's an interruption that throws you off, if it weren't for that it would be a good app.
B00555X8OA|4.0|Kahneman does his best to make it easy on us non-statisticians (for this, read normal sloppy thinkers) to grasp the many insights gained in decades of psychological research.  I picked it up first, wondering what a psychologist who won a Nobel Prize in Economics, had to say after a lifetime spent studying decision making. I found his approach, challenging us as readers to participate in the experimental process, to be a great strategy to break down the propensity some of us have to think that applies to the other guy, but me, I'd never make that mistake! Sure enough, I did, even knowing it was likely to be a set up!<br /><br />Though Kahneman proclaims his ambition to be to enhance &#34;water cooler gossip&#34; with a better vocabulary, I don't think it's likely we'll be talking much about System 1 and System 2 on our coffee breaks.  But I did find, over the month spent chipping away at this book, that I introduced it into far more conversations that is my norm, pulling out examples of this or that propensity--whether to jump to conclusions on limited evidence, or substitute a simpler for a more difficult question--in daily life.  I especially enjoyed the chapter on regression to the mean, and shared the most humorous bits with friends.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very satisfying read, and one I highly recommend to anyone interested in how we think and why we humans make so many not quite logical judgments.  Great for folks who enjoyed &#34;The Invisible Gorilla&#34; by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|The show continues to be well acted and I enjoy watching it.  Sometimes I watch an episode again as the first time I was interrupted while watching it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Really enjoy playing it. This graphics are great, very colorful and easy to see. Fun for anyone who enjoys Mahjong.
B005PK57NU|4.0|I like watching THE GOOD WIFE.  Not having commercials is great.  Also it if nice to watch several episodes at a time of my choosing.

B005M5PENG|5.0|i did not start watching the show from the beginning and now i love the show so i am playing catch-up
B002722R64|4.0|I loved Goldeneye as a kid. But watching it again about 18 years after its initial release, I noticed that it hasn't held up was much as I'd hoped. It still has that nostalgic feel to it and has a borderline campiness.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app gets better and better. Ditch the stock keyboard and pick this up. They keep adding features that you cannot live without.
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|I knew it would be a good movie, but it was even better than I expected. I highly recommend it!
1594203334|4.0|The book makes a lot of sense. As someone who spends time in Paris, I have often marvelled at how mature, yet child-like the kids are. The book explains a lot. There are some good lessons to be learned by over-indulgent American parents on how to raise youngsters.
069111966X|2.0|...why no one wanted to publish this book, it was poorly written whose idea can be completed in a couple chapters. I'm not saying the ideas are not worth learning, they are, it's just that it's hard to read cover to cover, which I couldn't do. Life is too short to read a bad book.
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|Great movie, excellent actors,the plot was great and it was well worth the cost.I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone it was great
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Good movies are still being made! I see why Daniel won the Oscar!  We must know our history so that we can learn from our mistakes.
B003V4ASV8|5.0|I loved this book. I found it easy to read from start to finish. I found myself immersed in the personal stories of the people in the book. I can't believe how much I learnt about North Korea just from reading this cleverly put-together personal narrative. This book has sparked a huge personal interest in North Korea.
B009R659L8|5.0|If you are a Mary Higgins fan you will love this new book. I truly believe this was one of her best works.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The Splashtop Remote Desktop is worth the purchase. It works better overall. It also has more useful features than the competitors. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to control their pc media center from afar.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is one of those few that are easy to learn and play, but have a depth that can really challenge.  It's a lot of fun to search for the right combination of infectivity, severity, and resistance.  As of this review I've only played five games and still have not unlocked viruses (the next type of pandemic after bacteria), and I'm already finding myself thinking of new strategies to try while I'm at work.  If only more games generated this interest!<br /><br />Another thing I like is that the premium content is not shoved in your face.  It's there if you want it, but if you don't, there are no pop-ups or in-game prompts to buy.<br /><br />One caveat, though, this is not a visually stimulating game.  There's no dynamic art or music.  Each game you'll be looking at a world map or the menus, and listening to a looped track of foreboding music.  It could get dull if you play more than a couple games per session, but by no means detracts from the game's overall quality.  If you're capable of being interested in a chess match, Plague Inc. will be no trouble.
B004I744AS|4.0|This program has came in helpful many times I've been curious about what a particular word means. It has came in handy whenever I would have a debate with a friend or family member about what a word means. I cannot say it is superior to other, more established,  e.g. Webster dictionaries. However, one cannot beat the price with the product. I recommend it to my friends and family.
B00ALKPTFA|5.0|A must for every living human being. Not only for its contents but for the way the author explains the finer details of every thing he wants to bring over to the reader.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|I watched this with my teenage children.  All three of us really enjoyed it.  It also showcases all three leading actors talents because they don't play the &#34;normal&#34; type character.
B009YU62H2|5.0|It's rare enough these days that an entire album is worth buying. I mean who still buys ALBUMS? You buy the songs you like on itunes or whatnot, and move on. I know personally I tend to stay away because most of the time, on an album of 10 songs, I like maybe 4.<br /><br />Not so with this one. I think I loved all but 1 song on this album, and it was way worth it. Some of the songs are simply amazing.<br /><br />Soundgarden fans of old will love the sound of this one. It's awesome to have the band together again.

B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I must admit that for the longest time, i truly despised Paramore. For no particular reason (except maybe their fans, but that's a stupid reason to dislike something). Finally, I listened to Riot! and was hooked instantly (truly shocking because my fave bands are Marilyn Manson, NIN, Ministry, ect). Around that time I started reading all the articles about how Hayley Williams split with the original dudes and was making a dramatic return. I thought that Paramore was probably over before I could even fully get into them....<br /><br /> Skip forward a couple months to the release of the single \\"Now\\", and i downloaded it cuz...well, it's only a dollar right? I put it onto a random playlist and was blown away by how good it was--almost instantly! Later that night i ordered the album.<br /><br /> It was extra tantalizing waiting for the record to arrive, because it took weeks longer than the seller had informed me (that's what i get for going the cheaper route). It was gonna have to be a damn good record for how long i waited for it. Finally, i lost all interest in hearing it as I decided to listen to Riot! on my walk home one warm spring day. It was a semi-rough day, so it felt nice to chill out and listen to it all the way home at a nice, leisurely pace. I got home, and to my amazement, a small brown package laid waiting in my mailbox!<br /><br /> This particular album had become something of a ridiculous myth in my mind, so I was slightly hesitant to actually listen to it. I decided to eat some dinner first. The wait eventually became waaaaayyyy too brutal so i put it on while making dinner...WOW. I was astonished by how much i liked it upon first listen! I usually need to warm up to new CDs (even ones that are now my very favorites), so this came as quite a surprise. In fact, EVERY song was 10/10, even the \\"Interludes\\", which I usually don't like on most records.<br /><br /> In short, if you like Paramore, you'll LOVE this album. If you like solid, well-written rock music with infectious hooks, you'll LOVE this album. If you don't know how you feel about them, this is a great one to start with. Another prime example of why 2013 is shaping up to be one of the greatest years in music I've ever experienced. Not to be missed!music with infectious hooks, you'll LOVE this album.

B0041KVV8U|3.0|The track selection is great. BUT the digital remix SUCKS, when compared to the the original analog mixes.<br />But thats the story as far as All the digital remixes go that have been done since the late 80s and all there  variants.<br /> And a digital remix on vinyl....WELL THATS JUST WRONG!!! why couldn't they use the original master tapes.<br />  Instead they created a NEW VERSION of an old recording...THINKING they could do better then the Master engineers, George Martin and Geoffrey Emerick & crew. (they cant,they dont,and have never done)<br />As a collection,put together in this day, (and digital) age. It OK...and maybe great, to new ears that arent over 50 year of age<br />But if your over 50....your going to notice.....somethings missing!

B006RJTKYU|3.0|I watched this solely on the fact that it was directed by Roman Polanski.  I had never heard of any of the actors.  And it was mildly entertaining but still fairly predictable.  Its just that they main characters where neither &#34;fearless&#34; nor did they kill a single vampire.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|An Actor's Life is a superb and witty short story, with a great twist at its conclusion. Mr. Whitehead has a very wiining style of writing, that pulls you happily along to his completely surprising finish. It is a great read and a tantalising sample of Duncan Whitehead's unique and compelling skills, as a debutant author. I hope we see many more works from this very talented and clever entertainer, in addition to his first novel 'The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club;' which is even more engrossing.
B002722R64|3.0|These movies were so much more entertaining when they had just been released.  Now I watch them and find it impossible to suspend my disbelief.  Which means that I then notice all the details that would never work in real life.  =(

0812974611|4.0|I'm very interested in Pompeii, having visited the site twice, and found this perspective very compelling.  The Roman way of life is quite amazing and I so appreciate the opportunity to learn more about it, which is woven into this story.  It was very entertaining.  It, in my view, is not written especially well.  I thoroughly enjoyed it just the same.  I highly recommend it to anyone with a curiosity about the events surrounding that eruption of Vesuvius.<br /><br />Joyce Brown

Much to the contrary we found it absolutely hilarious. This is fun, simple, and can be used in MANY MANY ways!

B00A81NFAS|5.0|It's often said that most romantic comedies or even comedy-dramas are now more paint-by-number than actual story, and that may be true, but \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" manages more depth and heart than most, and, in making both halves of the prospective whole majorly messed up, also more \\"real\\".<br /><br />If you're reading this site, you likely have seen in other reviews just what the story involves, so this review won't bore you with repeating the synopsis. With that said, Pat Solitano and Tiffany Maxwell are two broken, messed up people, certainly not the usual people one would expect a romantic dramedy to focus upon, but that is actually what makes the movie different and special. With Pat's bipolar disease and struggle to get it under control and rebuild his life (and get his wife back, a running theme which leads to Tiffany and more than he bargained for), and Tiffany's propensity to use sex as a salve *and* an emotional shield (which even sort of plays into the guilt over her husband's death), these are not the usual people you would associate with a love story.<br /><br />And this movie is a love story, but not only for Pat and Tiffany. It is a love of family, a love of dance, a love (obsessively so) of football, and, oddly, if not love, a sort of respectful nod to mental illness without making fun of it *or* miring itself in misery. Mental instability is almost its own character in the film, working its way around from Pat to Tiffany to Pat's own OCD father (brilliantly acted by Robert DeNiro) whose football superstitions rival his son's own problems, and also to Pat's friend from the mental institution (where he was forcibly remanded to for eight months after a rage incident upon discovering his cheating wife and her lover), Danny, who is well played by Chris Tucker, who teaches Pat and Tiffany a thing or two about dancing, and the craziness of falling in love with someone just as crazy as the other person. But in combining that crazy, oddly, comes stability. All of the above - besides the aforementioned DeNiro and Tucker - are pitch perfect, including Jacki Weaver, whose role as what would be just the vanilla wife and mother in any other romance movie, is filled with an extra \\"something\\" that allows her not to fade into the shadows against Cooper, DeNiro, or Lawrence, the latter three who, admittedly, make this movie shine. Lawrence, for being so young, shows that she is no fluke, has acting chops, and deserved that Lead Actress Oscar for her effort. The fact that Weaver, Cooper and, I believe DeNiro, were also nominated is no accident, either. A stellar cast only elevates what is already a terrific screenplay, also rare for the usual rom-com.<br /><br />To be clear, Pat and Tiffany are not meant as \\"poster children\\" for the mentally ill, so those who may initially want to steer clear because of the subject matter can rest assured, just two people who, through circumstance, manage to merge their brand of insanity into their own form of happiness and calm and focus when together. As the message of the movie says, it's about \\"reading the signs\\" and, if read right, those signs can lead from dark to light, a true \\"silver lining\\".
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I am enjoying this full length soundtrack so much!  It is a great score and I love listening to it over and over!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Like the LoTR, this is a great Peter Jackson movie/story. It is not a J.R.R. Tolkien movie/story, but it is still a great piece of entertainment. It has similar gratuitous alterations to Mr. Tolkien's Hobbit as does Jackson's LoTR. It is, unfortunately, not as good as LoTR IMO as it spends more time on the special effects/warring/chasing. Still, I've watched it three times now (including in the IMAX 3D), and it is enjoyable.

0439023521|5.0|The movie did not do this book justice!  Engaging reading, through the eyes of teenaged Katniss, it is much more than the adventure which drew us to the story.  This insightful book takes us, via a fictional dystopic post apocalyptic world, to examine the impact of social and economic imbalance on individuals and cultures.  It provides a compassionate view into the thought processes and personal impacts of wider cultural issues which frame our mores and legal systems, for both the rich and poor, the persecuted and the powerful.  A must-read for everyone surviving in the world of ever-changing balances of power and economics.

Well, this book has some great recipes, great explanations with variations on the recipe.  Really helps figure out a well balanced lunch the only downfall to me was it didn't have cuteness factor it is very utilitarian style.  But great recipes so good, just slightly change it so it looks better in the boxes vs just looking like food.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|l love this trilogy!  It is such an incredible story of the determination of the human spirit to survive as well as a cleverly woven analogy of the ways that we destroy ourselves and others, how we use cruelty to punish cruelty or fight terrorists with just another form of terrorism...and how there is always the population of those untouched by the suffering that results from their greed who can watch the suffering of others played out before their eyes and view it as entertainment.
1475972350|4.0|I'm as guilty as the next person when it comes to wasting a little time. I can't say that I deliberately waste anyone else's time, but I'm sure that it's happened - from time to time. Time Killer, the mystery novel about a psychopathic serial killer who wreaks vengeance on people who have wasted his time, violently ending their lives before they can waste anyone else's time is a great, suspenseful read. Watching the psychopath unravel quickly, going on a spree is horrifying. Max, an experienced Homicide detective with an impressive solve rate is the point man in a desperate hunt to catch the killer before he kills again, and again. Unfortunately for his solve rate and for the city, Max is in the middle of training Jesse, a talented, and very attractive new partner and dealing with some pretty gruesome flashbacks pertinent to his case. Time Killer is a great way to kill a few hours...I mean, a great way to enjoy a suspenseful mystery. After reading this book, no one is going to accuse me of wasting time for a very long time!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much. The romance was very believable and the problems in the relationship made it even more interesting. I would have enjoyed a more complete ending rather than only the possibility of happiness forever.

When you explain to people what the book is about and how this couple starts communicating with the victorian definition of flowers they think it sounds strange.  But its actually very lovely and a great story.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved the first book and was excited about the second, but it was too much like the first. Now, because of the ending, I must read the third. Sneaky,  way to sell books by the author, but she has to make a living too.

B003LXSY60|5.0|This is an excellent album. The Black Keys are an example of a great band finally making it to the big time. I really cant pick a favorite song theyre all awesome and rich with lyrical genius. 10 stars :) (even though the max rating here is five)
B004VMEILU|5.0|The book was better than what I thought. It is a great read. I recommend this book for any Bruce Lee fan.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|it was a funny movie just took forever to get there. Great actors in the movie and the girls were hilarious
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|The Big dvd came in a timely manner and is in excellent condtion!!!  Very glad to have an upgrade from VHS to dvd......we didn't even realize how much better the quality of picture would be!!!  What a huge difference!!!!  The copy we had was a VERY used rental that we bought when a video store closed down.....LOL  It's amazing how much better it is to watch a favorite movie with better quality!!!
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|Interesting concept, but zero substance. I feel like this book could have been authored by any number of pretentious teen to twenties boys I've met.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Tootsie arrived in a timely manner and the dvd was in excellent shape.....this movie is a favorite of ours and we're glad to upgrade from VHS to dvd!  Thanks!

B00003CXTG|5.0|So very glad to have a dvd of Pearl Harbor......our OLD copy was from a VERY used set of VHS tapes that we bought from a video store that closed down so part of our movie was nonexistent from damage from other people not caring for it properly before.  This new dvd to replace our old copy is EXCELLENT!!!!  It's like being at the theatre instead of the other old version we had in which the quality was about as good as someone standing on the roof adjusting the antenna and getting a lot of fuzz in the picture!!!  LOL  ; )
B00APUQKDG|3.0|I rented this movie because I love Robert Pattinson.  But it was very hard for me to watch.  I guess I just didn't understand it.  Glad I didn't purchase it.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|We love Dirty Dancing and were very glad to upgrade our old VHS to DVD!!!!  MUCH better quality!!!!  VERY glad to finally be replacing some of our old favorites!!!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers wastes no time with back story & gets right to what you want. finally we get the hulk we've all been waiting for.
B00005V9IL|5.0|Spellbinding, captivating, on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense, great cinematograph and fx; it had me believing. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the best in entertainment.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|Streisand at her best, combining her  androgenous qualities, unusual voice and terrific acting. The theme around what women cannot do in religion still contemporary.
1401238580|5.0|Great comic book and fast shipping. Buy it. Get the mask too so you can scare people with it. Makes for a good time.
1577314808|5.0|An excellent introduction to the thought of Krishnamurti. If you can apply these lessons to your life, your life will take on new meaning and contentment.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is a beautiful finish to a wonderful series. Some parts are emotional, happy, packed with action, or sorrowful. I really wish there was a 4th book!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|If you're looking for a good &#34;gamer mouse&#34; this will likely do the trick for you. It has all the bells and whistles you might want from a &#34;gamer mouse.&#34; Picked it up as a replacement for my old MX518. Used it for a few months but recently got rid of it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great macro and button function mapping.<br />I like the on-mouse sensitivity indicator next to the left mouse button.<br />The weight system and braided cord are great. Seriously. This is what I miss most about my new mouse.<br />The light in the mouse has an impressive color range, and you can set it to different colors per profile for an easy way to tell which profile is active.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I do not like the feel of the plastic on the right side where my ring finger lays, it has no texture to it and as a result feels somehow wrong and your fingers may slip.<br />The thumb buttons feel like they are made out of extremely cheap plastic. It drew my attention to how bad they felt.<br />I didn't realize just how much I hated mouse acceleration until I got this mouse, because this mouse has it. It became more and more noticeable to me over time and was the deal breaker. I took that for granted with the mouse I replaced.
0876852630|4.0|Charles Bukowski is a literary genius and this book does not disappoint.  It is not my favorite of his books that I have read but as with all of his work, it is worth the read.
B00BYKIKJS|1.0|Expected it to be like the book and it was not.  I was very disappointed.  Not worth watching if u have read the book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't say much more than this book helps seal all unanswered questions, and most importantly left me with a smile.
B00992CF6W|1.0|But this app will not, under any circumstances, download. I paid for it-and yes, it charged- but not download... It's quite annoying.
B00985E3UG|5.0|This book is a real eye-opener about the food industry, and has re-energized my own commitment to eat more whole, unprocessed foods. The science behind the &#34;bliss point&#34; and &#34;craveability&#34; of foods is both fascinating and horrifying, given the effects it has on our collective weight. Michael Moss pulls all the puzzle pieces of sugar, salt, and fat together in a way that is compelling and educational.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|I've only listened to it once or twice but I think it will grow on me once I hear it again
B00005LC4B|2.0|A lavishly produced yet unnecessary rehash of the 1962 classic. When it comes to Robert Mitchum's chilling Max Cady, there simply is no substitute. Director Martin Scorsese (or was it Brian De Palma?) assembles a fine cast and allows them to wallow in the endless mire. Cameo appearances by Mitchum, Gregory Peck and Martin Balsam only emphasize the remake's inferiority. However, Elmer Bernstein creates an effective adaptation of Bernard Herrmann's original &#34;Cape Fear&#34; score.
B000068FWC|3.0|I remembered it being better when I first heard it but it's adequate. My mother (75!) seems to enjoy it
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I can't wait until the evening when I can watch another Dexter episode.  Going into season 5 now, should be caught up by the time the new season starts!  I'm a Dexter-addict!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I enjoyed the book, it's fun , keeps you're interest, not at all boring. I am glad I bought it.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I'm at the beach every chance I get, so this was a home run for me. The story was great and the scenery was amazing. Fun movie
B008XG1X18|5.0|ideas and inspiration, cute stuff, recipes, and I have been introduced to some fun blogs, websites and retailers  Fun way to kill time when on hold etc!!
B00B7FWWNA|1.0|I am a huge fan of Helen Hunt, but this movie was just too strange.  I thought it was going to be funny, but it wasn't at all. It was just a boring Helen and no content. I would not recommend this to anyone.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|Not the best but a good Sunday movie<br />If there is nothing on TV but reality shows and you want to see some action, this movie will keep you entertain
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|If your a movie buff then this one has to get added..  My sister loves it so it was here gift for her birthday..
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I absolutely LOVE the Outlander series...I bought the audio books in addition to my kindle editions.  Must say I prefer the audio version with the accents :)
B00066FBQG|5.0|My uncle lives not to far from where they filmed parts of the movie and he had not seen the movie in a long time.  So when the city was going to do movies in the park he was set.  Then he got really sick and missed date night.  So I got him this so he could still watch the movie and have date night..
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Like any Tarentino movie I was entertained and always expecting a twist. I was not disappointed. Language and content can be jaring to some, but overall a good watch
B00B0NDF26|5.0|These girls have come a long way.  Their style has changed dramatically but this album still feels like them, which few bands can pull off.  I can't help but bop my head when listening to this album.  It is actually my workout music haha.  Very pumped up and upbeat music, I wouldn't expect any less from Tegan and Sara.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I admittedly did not read the books that these movies are based from. But I can say that the movie was great. A surreal take, and refreshing spin. There are many political undertones, I couldnt help but think of the French Revolution when I watched this. The similarities within this trilogy are there. Looking forward to seeing Catching Fire this fall.
B00992CF6W|5.0|good worth the money to get game but when is the update come really good hi hi hi :) hi hi good. YOLO spam
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Great return to his real style of singing.  He is so smooth to listen to. Can't wait for a concert tour.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|This film follows a quirky German bounty hunter by the name of Dr. King Schultz (Christopher Waltz) traveling under the guise of a dentist amidst the back roads of The South  predating The Civil War, where Dr. King had helped to free a slave Django(Jaime Foxx) and rescue his wife from a torturous Southern plantation. Now available on the high quality Blu-Ray disc. With several awesome special features, my favorite being the costume design. There are some pretty outrageous costumes used in the film and seeing how seeing how much fun the actors had wearing them is extremely entertaining. Quentin Tarantino really captivates with audience with sensational scenes, and extremely realistic violence. The sequences left you on the edge of your seat the entire movie with each sequence followed up by an even more impressive one.  Tarantino snipes, and satirizes many controversial issues such as the Ku Klux Klan and Slavery but gives the audience a show that they would have never expected. Coming from the same director as Inglorious Basterds any fans of that film would be greatly pleased with this one as well. Although I thought this was a fantastic movie with equal directing, I did feel as if it dragged on quite a bit. Almost a three hour run time that is tough for any movie fan to sit through. I give this film 4/5 stars on this review because it did get hard to follow with such a long screen time. Find more info on this film at [...]    Graydon Frenzel
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got this game thinking I wasn't going to like it but I love it.  I get so caught up with it sometimes that I don't want to put it down.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|James Cameron is one of the most successful directors in the world a prime example of his expertise, Titantic one of the highest grossing movies of all time. He spent close to three hundred million dollars on the film and as I walked into the theater I did not know what to expect. Per usual he delivered a ground breaking film. This film takes place on an earth like planet named Pandora where a private military force hired by miners invade to acquire a valuable resource. This movie pure entertainment, it provides several Go Green and Anti-war/American insinuations  throughout the film as well as being a technological masterpiece. Cameron used many different lighting, 3D, and storytelling techniques never before seen. My favorite aspect was that he never sacrificed story for action. Each character was important even in the final battle and what happened to them was just as vital to which side won. It became the highest grossing film ever made. So I would say that Avatar appeals to just about any movie goer.  The acting was not spectacular but, the effects definitely make up for it. I originally saw it 3D in theaters but when recently watching it on Blu-Ray 3D I was just as satisfied as I was in the theater. Plus with over eight hours of bonus features it is a must have for any movie collector. The collectors cut offers a new intro to the film, that I thought was even better than the original. I give this film 5/5 stars. More info on Avatar 3D at [...]<br /><br />Graydon Frenzel
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|This game is uber addicting. We're talking... morning day and night type addicting. However, I'll do specific missions and not get rewarded until I do it about 3 times. Right now I'm expanding my park for the 3rd time hoping that this will finally fulfill my mission and give me the xp and $ it says i'll get. Also... All the good dinos are EXPENSIVE. I'll probably never have a megladon, or a t-rex. stupid.<br /><br />Update!!!<br />8/8/13 :<br />They've made an aquatic branch and a Glacier expansion. They released about 5 dinos on the Glacier expansion and now I'm not getting anymore missions or finding anymore samples. Also, I try to buy the dino bucks (4.99 for 55) and it says I have no credit card info on file and to update it. So I try and it takes me to Amazon to update my info... but my info is all there. When I contacted them about it, they asked me \\"have you talked to amazon about this?\\" I said no... because my info is all there with amazon... and I never heard anything back. They must not want my money! Oh well... the game lags like CRAZY now that I have more dinos and am doing more in the park... I've got to delete cache constantly or hard reboot my kindle. I don't have any other games or apps on my kindle so I can't see the kindle being the issue.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Christopher Nolan directs one of the most mind bending films I have ever seen, literally. It follows a skilled extractor Cobb(Leonardo DiCaprio) who infiltrates a wealthy, incipient heir's dreams to complete what is thought to be an impossible task. A harrowing ordeal, running around people's dreams,but he must do so to regain his ability to reenter the U.S. to get his old life back. The storyline of the movie is extremely complex and if I spoiled the ending it would have no meaning unless someone knew how the cast ended up there.  Nolan keeps the audience guessing by skewing what we understand to be a dream, reality, dreams without reality, and the perception of a dream and real time. He does so by using the idea that we never really know when or where a dream begins. Roger Ebert gave a great quote in his review for this film, explaining how the audience can relate to this film stating that \\"We are always in the Now. We have made some notes while getting here, but we are not quite sure where here is.\\" I have never seen anything like this film it is wholesomely original and those looking for something new will enjoy it. If the movie itself in theaters was not enough, now on DVD there is a load of interesting Special Features. The Extraction Mode: which goes through how Nolan, DiCaprio and, the crew designed the films setting and key moments. The feature I enjoyed the most was the one that everyone can relate to, Dreams: Cinema of the Subconscious. Everyone dreams, and the idea that our dreams can be a functioning parallel reality is extremely interesting. I give this film 4/5 stars. Looking for more information on the film?

B005COO1X6|5.0|I loved this story, it did not at all follow the path I thought it was taking, it kept me on my toes, scared, and unable to put my kindle down.
B008QP3ZYE|1.0|I am ashamed at what an impulse buy this was. But there just appeared to be so much integrity to the cover; all the titles of those excellent films, each with their own integrity to credit what I could only imagine to be the frontal lobe of all cinema knowledge, in convenient DVD format.<br /><br />Oh, Jesus was I wrong. The first few minutes were spent praying that the narration was a team effort, so that shortly I might hear from someone other than a lilting-in-all-the-wrong-ways, disenfranchised man whose voice was as lipid and lifeless as a used bus ticket.<br /><br />Turns out he wrote the bloody thing, and directed it- a fact which came to make more and more sense, the more images of trains and pointless street scenes I watched flash their way apathetically across the screen.<br />(And is it just me, but does absolutely nothing correlate?)<br />Not only do the street scenes look completely dated, but they detract from the- dare I call it- commentary.<br /><br />What a shambolic, Hodge-podge of cinematic garbage, and what a fool I felt for sitting through more than one episode. How on earth could this vapid voice, a voice itself designed for silent film, ever hope to capture the excitement of a single part of the movie experience?<br /><br />The answer is, I don't give a flying cahoot any more, and am now trying to pawn off this ludicrously expensive mistake any which way I can. Were I in the same country, I would drive to Mr. Cousin's home personally to fling it, corner-edge forward, at his temples. As it stands, I may actually make some money off it by using it as a sleeping aid, or perhaps a test-your-endurance game at carnivals. The only problem with the latter is that there's only one person on earth who wouldn't chew through his own knuckles to avoid more than an hour of this drivel. That person is Mr Cousins himself.<br /><br />What an insult to film lovers, and under such a ludicrously overstated title. I wish to goodness I could get my money back.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Probably the single most frustrating app that I've had to use. I was initially excited about the convenience that would be afforded by my being able to access books on my phone or PC, especially for class. Then I had to write papers on those books. Turns out that the kindle reader doesn't have page numbers, just several thousand \\"locations.\\" Good luck constructing acceptable footnotes with that. Perhaps even worse, there is no search function. Seriously. The Kindle reader for Android has a search function, but the one for PC doesn't? That's an absolute no-brainer. Just compounds the issues presented by a lack of page numbers if you are trying to find something.<br /><br />If you are reading for pleasure, then these things might be less than frustrating. If you are a student, then this is the absolute last medium through which you should want to access a text. Which is unfortunate, because this kind of application should facilitate academic use. It's digitized, so it should be easy to find things right? I guess not. I'm just going to have to stick with PDFs that I find online elsewhere that I can just open in adobe and have zero problems with.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small package, great little sharpener. Few passes gives good edge on all types of blades.<br />Would recommend this product to anybody.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is an easy read humorous book with unexpected twists and turns.  Much on the order of &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34;.
B000FC11A6|5.0|If you like crypto and perl programming and Linux, and if you like to think about 20th Century computer history in a tentative or speculative way, you might enjoy this book.  Quite a lot.<br /><br />If you have never even thought about any of the above subjects, reading this book might help you understand why some nerds (including myself) just absolutely LOVE it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Thought provoking, sometimes humorous. Educational and haunting.  I usually don't care to read dialogue written with an accent, but this was cute and often funny.  The orphanage chapters were difficult to bear.  I appreciate being informed of those horrors the poor children had to endure.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Couldn't put it down.  I love the story of Eva and Gideon. Can't wait for the next one!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|it wakes me up but, I wish you could do more with it.<br />like, make different locations for the weather, download alarm tunes,  and know more about the weather.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I was so intrigued by the first season, I had to order seasons 2 and 3 immediatly.  They did not disappoint.  I can only say, I am having a hard time waiting for the beginning of season 4.
1439181780|5.0|I can't endorse this book enough!<br /><br />If you've read &#34;The Secret&#34;, you know the secret is Law of Attraction. Spoiler alert--within the 1st few pages of &#34;The Power&#34;, you'll find that the power that attracts and magnetizes is...Love. But as is true in any aspect of life, knowledge alone will do nothing for you; you must apply that knowledge.<br /><br />That's what this book is really about--how to use love to attract to you all that you desire in life. If your life is already working for you--your job/career and relationships are all perfect and you have all the health, wealth, and happiness you could ever dream--then you've likely mastered the law of Love, and you don't need this book. However, if anything in your current life situation falls short of your dreams, this book may help you achieve your dreams. Just as any weight-loss eating plan will help a person lose weight, and any exercise program will help a person improve health and fitness--both plans work only when the plan is strictly adhered to. The outcome is directly proportional to the level of input/commitment. The same is true of the concepts in this book.<br /><br />When the student is ready, the master will appear (Buddhist proverb). When I ordered this book, I was a ready student. And my life continues to change, in unimaginable ways, now that I am applying the concepts in this book, using love to attract all good things into my life.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone desiring a fuller, richer life.
B008Y78M60|5.0|Good plot, good acting, good direction. Need I say more. The story is about a women who happened to be running a boarding house that John Wilkes Booth visited and as the story suggests conspired against Lincoln and the government of the north along with her son. When Lincoln was assassinated they came after her because they felt she had been party to the conspiracy. She was likely shielding her son's possible involvement but the story is about the court case that came about and the lawyer that was assigned to defend her. Interesting story. Movie is typical of Robert Redford directing...it keeps you interested throughout the entire movie.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Satisfying end to the series.  not the best ending but gave good closure.  I stopped reading the series around book 7 because I was tired of waiting for the end.  Do not get me wrong  - I love epic series but not endless traveling...  A friend convinced me to finish and I was not disappointed.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|I'd say this is Pearl Jam's best album.  The price for MP3 album download on Amazon was unbeatable.  Every song is a winner.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|This is really useful backpack.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Plenty of room<br />Multiple compartments<br />Useful top compartment for keeping MP3 players.<br />Flexible base pad which helps bag to balance on floor.<br />Great laptop compartment with small pouch for the charger.<br /><br />Cons:<br />i am not sure about the material used. I checked it has good reviews saying durable .. thus purchased. but the material is little cheap then my other Swiss gear backpack<br /><br />Over all i am enjoying it. it is good overall backpack. recommendd to anyone.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|I believe I was able to purchase this entire album dirt cheap during Amazon's MP3 album sales.  Definitely worth the money.  Album has at least three very good  songs on it, and the remainder are fairly decent--at least in my opinion.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|I have bought this filer for my new GP3 and it was a great investment.<br />the videos i took in 1080 format under water were superb and colors were so clear.<br /><br />the only draw back is that you have to seriously take care of it when entering the water. mine was broken on my boat dive. so better snap in when you are under the water or let someone handed over to you when you are in the water.<br />i would have given this product a 5* if is was a stronger. apart from that, i am buying two more to keep them handy with me.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Very smart writing; very in tune with current events.  This was a repeat viewing of the Season 1. Two words.
B004IPPINW|5.0|I loved the way the story was told, and the viewpoint from a foreign perspective.  Really makes you think about a lot of things.  I thought, as I was reading, however, that I was lisrening to a man of middle age or older, and was very surprised to find the storyteller was 25.  Could not stop reading!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really love this show!  I didn't start watching it until Season 3, so I was thrilled to be able to view the earlier seasons.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It was worth $6.99.When I first played I was very excited.I am a big minecraft fan.You should get this game if you read this revew.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This is a fun series, and makes you think about what science is doing for the future.<br />It is a great show!
B000IDEORY|5.0|One of my very favorite movies.  I can watch it over and over.  I will never get tired of watching it.  When it's on, I don't take my eyes off the screen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app! I works on my Kindle Fire HD, my brother's Samsung Tablet, and my mom's iPhone 4S. I recommend it to all of you Mincemeat fans out there! *thumbs up*
B00785P2QC|5.0|Entertaining game.  I play it a couple of times a day.  Definitely worth the while.  I highly recommend it.  You will not be disappointed.
B00B6OEDS4|2.0|When I read a description of this new music, I THOUGHT I was going to get something similar to music by Sade. I was wrong. Unfortunately, there is nothing memorable about the sound or the singing. I hear it but don't notice it. It seems more appropriate for a cocktail party or lounge; background music, unobtrusive and &#34;unengaging&#34; (Is that a word?)..
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Good movie, didn't know the story line until I watched it and I enjoyed it. I would recommend to friends and family.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'd been telling my honey to watch it for a while as I saw them all before. He spent the next few days watching them and loved the show. It's frustrating, but a great sow non the less.
B006LRUVUA|4.0|Sometimes, you really can be in two places at once... for those other times, when you need to, but can't, there's teamviewer...<br /><br />Make sure you setup any new Pc/Mac with the host version, and then, if need be you can re-connect to it later... not to worry though, it's not so stealthy that you won't know if someone has connected to your computer, it has a pop-up and shows who has connected, so you can see who's there (name of user- not pic).
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Good casting. Good movie to watch on Friday. Picture is Good quality and good price. Good speed and service. Good.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie. I can't wait to see the next one  Jennifer Lawrence is so good  You'll like it too,  I'm sure
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Appreciate to have this time killer on my phone..dont do games, but had to have this one..hilarious....thanks rovio.. I play  angry birds on my  android  HTC evo design 4g..it runs flawlessly..would highly recommend this free option to star wars fans everywhere...its free
B008Y768XO|5.0|Wonderful story!  You never be the same after watching it! Get a box of klennex because there won't be a dry eye in your entire house.
1416562605|1.0|I disliked the book from the first page.  It dealt with people I have nothing in common with, found I disliked the crude language used on every page, and couldn't wait to put it down and not finish it!  Shall I tell you what I REALLY think?
B000U6DU92|5.0|I just got hooked on this show late but I loved this start to the series. The complete opposite worlds manage to collide in this episode. It was genius to make the Sheriff who is used to an ordinary world have a car accident in Eureka. He is suddenly thrust into this new world and ultimately takes on the role of a sheriff who is in charge of trying to keep order in an unruly and crazy high tech world.<br /><br />It's the perfect combination of comedy and drama and has the just right number of things that get blown up.
B00932A4XE|4.0|I was hoping for more comedy because pregnancy and parenting can be quite comical. But, not bad. My husband never did what these guys did though!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I looked everywhere for this combo set and found it at a great price.  This is a really good movie with the only caveat being that there is alot more peril than I've ever seen in a &#34;kid movie&#34;. Especially so at the end. Other than that content note I feel confident in rating this up.
1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a book about an autistic 15 year old teenager named Christopher John Francis Boone who lives in Swindon, England. He loves to do math and knows all the prime numbers up to 7,057 which he uses as the chapter numbers in the book. Christopher has many behavioral problems such as detesting the color yellow and also hates being touched, cannot tell a lie, and does not understand metaphors and jokes or human emotions. He decides to start an investigation on who killed his neighbor's dog with a garden fork and will not stop until he does, taking him on a journey to places he never imagined, affecting him both mentally and physically.<br /> This book in my opinion is very confusing and at times boring. \\"...I start thinking about Coco Pops and lemonade and porridge and Dr Pepper and how I wasn't eating my breakfast in Egypt and there wasn't a rhinoceros...\\" This quote I believe represents how confusing this book really is because of the spontaneous  topic changes and run on sentences. I perceived the author's message to be that if you put your fears aside and are determined that you can do anything. This is a valuable book to read because it will inspire you and teach you that anything is possible and that you have the capability to do it. From reading this book I have gained the view that I am truly capable of doing anything I would like, and that people are both half good and half bad, but only show you one side of themselves at a time.<br /> \\"Mr. Jeavons said that I liked maths because it was safe. He said I liked maths because it meant solving problems, and these problems were difficult and interesting but there was always a straightforward answer at the end. And what he meant was that maths wasn't like life because in life there are no straightforward answers at the end.\\"
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Love this kind of show. Wish there was more of them. Not quite as good as 24 but still very good.
B004XUMMFE|3.0|Not sure what all the 5 stars are for, but I'm an avid sci-fi watcher and this series is only so-so in my opinion. Not a lot of computer graphics (CG), nothing terribly exciting, and my biggest complaint is that the series like many others has no defined storyline. no beginning and no end. just going week to week, season to season, and making stuff up as it goes along as long as the ratings are high.
0345803493|1.0|The book was bent in the packaging, so it looks like a second hand book. Terrible......The cover of the book was folded back causing numerous creases.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Because of its seemingly-weak preview, I didn't see this movie in the theatre; however, after renting, my family bought it. They watch it every night. I know, every night! Good music, minimal foul language, & just a drop of raunch. My choir & band students are really good at quoting it, too & I always know what movie they're talking about, good grief. A must-see!
B009WJ14FA|5.0|Saw these guys open for the Who. Been hooked ever since. They have a great sound, and an energetic performance!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Just started playing but seems fun so far. Not the biggest fan of posting everything to facebook, but I'll get over it.
B0098A1TEE|5.0|One of my tap teachers used her in class. Her music is so much fun!! I especially love her more 1960's tracks like Lipstick on His Collar.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|I watched this with my daughter when she was a little girl...we just saw it again last night.Very moving, positive and an inspiring.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|I bought this for my Goddaughter Sofia so it was a perfect gift. Everyone wants to share a name with a princess!
B001GH3KLW|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite studio produced Dead albums. I have lost and then re-bought this album about 3 times.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|An excellent fantasy that I couldn't put down I filled all my spare time burning through the pages and I was not disappointed!
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|My daughter is a huge Luke Bryan fan and has all his CD' s and loves this one just as much as all his other music
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a fun set of puzzles.  Very engaging. Not like anything I have played before.  Cannot wait for another installment.
B009MYARIK|3.0|This is not as good as the authors usual books. The heroine was a little annoying. Couldn't seem to make myself care about her.
B00BD07SGU|5.0|I happened to be in N.Y.C. when Amorphis was there with their then brand new frontman Tomi Jousten.  I caught the show and left as a big Amorphis fan.  I've liked all of their subsequent releases.  After listening to Circle about a dozen times, I've grown to really appreciate it.  The band really benefited from having and outside producer, Circle has a depth that only becomes apparent from repeated listening.  Circle, like Silent Waters, Eclipse and Skyforger will be played over and over again.
B000FC1PNE|3.0|Of all the 8 books, this was my least favorite, but it is still a good read.  The storyline was a little off to me and I think the h should have offered a bit more resistance, cause the H did state in front of others that he would not marry her.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|When does the next book come out? The  plot is Great. More Danareys and Arya. Don't spend enough time with them
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is verly good you have good graphics and daily challenges every week and you can put your Facebook account and challenge your friends
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I like QT films and this certainly is one.  Never really sure if I'm supposed to laugh or cry or just squirm in my seat during many parts of the movie.  Not saying that is a bad thing....<br />And not sure what my man QT is trying to get across with the gratuitous use of the &#34;n&#34; word?  I'm sure he's trying to say something....I'm just not sure what.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|Very fun game although I think it's a little too much like the game minecraft and feel as though it could use a more origanal idea. Controlling seems to be hard to get used to. Altogether though it is like a different version of minecraft-PE. Definitally worth getting though.
B003NRYMZQ|3.0|The whole idea of the show is good. Because of the sexual content and language it's not a good family show. The show would be better without it.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Really enjoyed it.  As an introvert, that's all I care to share with all you strangers.  Just read the book!
B00BESM14U|4.0|It was a good movie but not for children. Because of the sexual content and language I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 18.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|To much words do Not Read this book I do not like it is way to big to study with
B000V39KDO|4.0|I was going through a Gerard Butler phase and just needed to check this out once again.  Just what I needed.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great game! I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT ON A CONSOLE. It freezes. sometimes. But great all together.  Highly recommended for gamers
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Full of sex appeal (important), strategy, humor and whatever else you're looking for.  Makes me sometimes wish I worked in a law firm similar to this one...but only on tv.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Even if you're not a fan of history you will love Vikings, it's fun, engaging and well written. I can't wait for the second season to start!
B0063GORYU|4.0|i like this game...everything is great except the tricky ad u have to navigate through before you can start a new game
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I've been following the work of Chuck Lorre as far back as GRACE UNDER PRESSURE.  Also involve his trademark &#34;vanity cards.&#34;<br />BBTh. is the best of the lot.
B001GXNBJW|5.0|i love the black keys. i own most of their music and this was just one of the few albums missing in my collection.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in the last 12 months.  Acting was extraordinaire and effects were amazing.
B009VB97EY|5.0|it's one of the best comedies i've seen all year.  just couldn't take this movie seriously....at all. but the thing was the movie was taking itself seriously and it just made it funny to me. i don't know ... the storyline wasn't original it's one we've seen countless times the only difference is the movie is about male strippers. also the main girl in the film doesn't really change her facial expression through out the movie and that was sort of annoying.
0345803493|5.0|I haven't finished the last book in the trilogy yet, but this one definitely left me waiting more!!<br /><br />This book really digs deep into Christian's past, and we learn about his deepest secret and why he is the way that he is. From an outside perspective this man seems like it has everything figured out: he is handsome, rich, successful, and very charming. Yet, a glimpse into his past tells a heartbreaking story that really touched me and I felt like I was right there with Ana throughout her journey to get to know him.<br /><br />Like I said in my previous review of the first book, Christian Grey is a very complex and layered character which makes him very intriguing. You think you got him figured out, yet you realize that there is so much more that lies beneath. I apologize for being vague, but to say anymore would be to take away from the book.<br /><br />Also, like in the first book, Ana is still a strong and witty character and I admire the way she handles herself while dealing with Christian's pass...um, relationships so to speak. I know meeting people from your lover's past is anything but pleasant, but for Ana this is taking that unpleasantry up a whole notch.<br /><br />There is still a lot of...sexual activities going on between them, but don't let that fool you. If you think that this book is all about sex, then you are focusing on a single tree and not looking at the whole forest.<br /><br />I am definitely rooting for Christian and Ana, but there is so much that stands in their way: past relationships, dangerous enemies, and Christian and Ana's own insecurities.<br /><br />Can't wait to see how it all plays out in the final book!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I love Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. They are serious artists that usually talk about serious issues and it's nice to see them have fun and they definitely did both with The Heist. And I'm sure everyone is starting to see that too.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|This is an amazing story. I literally felt her struggles and her fear during the book as well as her sadness. I read this while take a Nazi Germany course because I wanted to be completely immersed in the class, as well as being able to understand what life was like for those who had to experience this first hand. Its more than just a story about a Jewish woman surviving, this is a story of what it's like for an intelligent woman to thrive in a society not meant for her to enjoy. As a woman I felt this so acutely. Ms. Beer is a woman who history should never forget. The world is richer for having heard her life.
B008393Q2O|1.0|I think other items are better to use..  The learning of this app and program is hard to use  and learn
B00BG4UWPC|2.0|I knew it would be difficult to top their last album, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, but with this album the band didn't really try to. They went overboard with the 80's synths, and dropped the catchy hooks that made most of their previous songs so enjoyable. There are still a few good songs on this album, but it's probably not worth getting the whole album. I'd recommend just downloading Entertainment and maybe one or two of the other strong tracks.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Unless you have studied a lot of history - - the Lincoln time period - - it should be watched.  Some of the things he did are being used by all presidents today.  See it and you will learn a lot.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Dissappointed with the ending.  Guess you can't always have the fairy tale ending. I was happy with the series overall.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Being true - - it was an excellent book.  The mention of shooting was part of the story and should not change anyone opinion that are opposed to killing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The evolution of all the characters in the show is so realistic that I could almost believe it is based in a real story.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|If you do not like to see blood on the screen,, this movie is not for you.  It is an excellent movie if you are willing to watch some blood scenes.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This app is amazing! I've never had anything like this before, and I was very skeptical about how well it would work, but it's buttery smooth. It works beautifully on my KFHD and it even works really very well on my poor old LG Optimus V which REALLY surprised me. It was so easy to set up; besides needing to enable/install framework 3.5 on my windows 8 computer, it went without a hiccup and took barely any time at all. I'm sure I will find new ways to utilize it the longer I have it, but for now it turns my phone and kindle into perfect remotes for playing music and videos on my computer from across the room. I can open different music players, browse YouTube, 'like' songs on Pandora, change my computer's volume, etc, all with this app, and all very easily. It even gives you the option the play the audio on either the android or the computer, how cool is that?<br /><br />The only thing I would like is the option to change where the audio plays (android or computer) while still connected to the computer. As of now you have to disconnect to change the setting. It barely takes any time at all to connect or disconnect so it's not that big of a deal, but maybe something for the next update! Also every now and then when trying to connect to my pc from android it tells me that my Google password isn't right or something and I have to press retry, then it prompts me to reenter my gmail and password, but all the info is already filled in and it's right, so I just hit connect and it lets me in just fine. Overall it's not a big issue, just kind of annoying.<br /><br />Hopefully these things will be changed/fixed in future updates, but it's still definitely a 5 star app by far!! I'm very very happy with it, and it's definitely the best FAOTD I've seen in a while!
B001BANK32|5.0|This book is excellent. And a highly recommended read.  It certainly paralleled Stephen King's miniseries in 1997 with minor detail differences.  For those who like psychological horror stories, this would be a highly recommended read.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Cannot login on my kindle fire hd, frustrated. Searched solution and found one: Delete data and cache, force stop, still freezing at login, not working.
B000YENUIQ|4.0|This film is the second successful colloboration of David Cronenberg and actor Viggo Mortneson following their &#34;A History of Violence&#34; and Mortenson also appear later as Carl Jung in &#34;a Dangerous Method&#34;.  A story about the Russian mob in London, Mortenson creates a mysterious Russian mobster who becomes involved with a nurse of Russian origin (Naomi Watts) who's trying to figure out the death of a teenage Russian girl who died from an supposed abortion. The excellent cast of Armin Mueller Stahler and Vincent Cassel add to the tension plus there's a bloody scene in a spa which outdoes their previous film. Highly recommended.
B000002ADT|5.0|&#34;KIND OF BLUE,&#34; is by far Miles Davis greatest performance.  I enjoy his playing the muted trumpet horn on all tracks on this cool jazz cd.  Even though I have several selections included on my Miles Davis &#34;Essentials&#34; 2-cd set; I still decided to order this quality cd remastered from his original LP album onto digital cd. This is a great jazz cd to listen to after a stressful day at work or otherwise.<br />There are only 6 selections on this cd, but that is alright in my book because they are all stellar performances of Miles Davis.  As an added enjoyment music accompanist on this stellar jazz cd include: John Coltrane , tenor saxophone; Cannonball Adderley, alto saxophone; Bill Evans, piano; Paul Chamberlain, bass; Jimmy Cobb, drums; Wynton Kelly, piano on selection #2. This great cd was remastered from analog tapes on Columbia's Legacy series of music.  I highly recommend this all-time great cd performance of Miles Davis and other great jazz legends performing of this laid back and relaxing cd.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|I never really cared a lot for the original being that it was very chessy but this sequel really floored me.  With Jeff Bridges playing 2 roles and a better director and story plus 3D and the lovely Olivia Wild, this one is a winner in 3D top boot.
B00000I14Z|2.0|Actually, I ordered this jazz cd rather quickly after reading reviews on the very best jazz recordings.  After listening to Charlie Mingus very loud and blaring jazz performances on Jazz on the Tube, I decided to return this cd back to seller for full credit on my Amex card.  When the cd arrived at my home, I merely wrote on package:  &#34;Customer refused Merchandise-Return to Sender.&#34;<br />I will check my newest bill to make certain that I did receive credit for this return cd.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I have just downloaded this App. and it is a useful tool for travel. Nice features and great look of clock.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is why I bought the kindle. So my mother in-law could play this game.  I guess she liked it ok.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I enjoyed this game and look forward to more. I wish it were longer because it was so much fun. The hints were helpful without telling you the answer.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Liked it. took a little time to figure it our but that was the fun of it too. kids laughed at it a lot
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a captivating story. I love all the characters and the multiple storylines. Very, very well done! I'm looking forward to more.
B00AKOB7CG|1.0|Hate the ads that pop up with this one. Just because I exercise does't mean I'm looking for a date:)
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this book, I felt it had a memorable plot and I couldn't wait for the sequel. I originally purchased this as a hard copy, lent it out and had to buy myself a kindle replacement as I missed being able to re read it.<br /><br />Can't wait for the third book.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Wish I had more time to play this one. makes your brain work and is great fun at the same time
B00355L2TU|5.0|This product is an excellent purchase for anyone looking for a home workout.  I would recommend this program to everyone.
B0067R0APK|3.0|I like the new look of the app except for the radar section. Once again the radar fails to open completely into full-screen. This has happened before in other versions. I was told it would be fixed in future updates. I'm waiting...
0843135697|5.0|My son loves these little books, thy are full of humour and help kids learn to read. Will buy some more from the collection
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|This is how all vinyls should be. High quality material with complete song lyrics on deluxe printed sleeves.  This album has become somewhat of a soundtrack to 2013 for me, along with Amok from Atoms for Peace and more recently Bankrupt! from Phoenix.  It's amazing to see Bowie come back so strongly after years of silence.  My one complaint about the set is the cheap generic sleeve for the included CD - but you can't always have it all and this release almost gets you there.
0843199601|5.0|My son still loves to receive these little books even though he is not a small kid anymore. He has most of these books from this collection
1250012570|4.0|Eleanor & Park, by Rainbow Rowell is the story of young love that blossoms out of desperation. Eleanor is a red-haired chubby 16-year-old with the wrong clothes and the wrong family. Park is a \\"weird Asian kid\\" who hangs out on the fringes of the in-crowd, though he isn't exactly one of \\"them.\\" The two bond over comic books, The Smiths, and a fervent need for one another.  Set in the 1980's, in some ways this book reads like a classic brat pack movie plot. I even pictured queen of the misfits, Molly Ringwald, as Eleanor.  I liked both Eleanor and Park and I was rooting for them to win out over the people that terrorized them, both in and out of school. Sometimes, though, love does not conquer all. Eleanor & Park may be filled with the angst of adolescence, but Rowell writes without melodrama. Her prose is spot on for age of the main characters and the time period, but she manages to write in a way that is simultaneously timeless, making her novel definitely worth reading.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|As someone operating in the development world, it was very nice to see the other side of the IT fence
0374214913|4.0|I am not sure how I first stumbled upon Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan. It happened while I was searching for books to propose for my book club's April pick.  I suggested it along with Eleanor & Park and Me Before You, which was ultimately chosen.  I decided to read all three, however, and Mr. Penumbra's was absolutely my favorite. The novel centers on Clay Jannon, a college grad who finds himself out of work when the company he does graphic design work falls victim to the recession.  An avid book lover, Clay takes a job at an independent bookstore whose clientele have strange interests. The bulk of the story chronicles Clay's quest to decode the mysteries held among the strange books that line Mr. Penumbra's shelves- a quest that is absolutely fantastical, yet ultra-modern in it search for the secret to eternal life. Sloan fills his pages with allusions the appeal to the nerdiest of us all; the video-gamers, techies, and potter-heads. He expertly exemplifies the dichotomy that exists for those of us who simultaneously love library stacks and kindles, who cherish both museums and Wikipedia,-those of us who love information acquisition in any form.  Although I cracked the code early on, I was still highly invested in seeing Clay's quest all the way through to completion, and when he finally fulfilled his mission, I found myself smiling.
B00742BVW8|5.0|The cinematography alone is breathtaking!<br />Jet Li's character is so different from other films he has been - it is like you are actually feeling the film through him<br />A must film to see!
0670026603|4.0|Jojo Moyes's Me Before You was this month's pick for my book club. It was my month to make three recommendations the group, and I nervously chose Me Before You as one of the options. When the majority of the group chose it, I could only hope that it wouldn't let us down. Although I thought the concept of the novel- the friendship that evolves between a caregiver and her quadriplegic client- seemed interesting, I wasn't exactly sure what to make of it, even as I read the first few chapters.  I quickly became totally engrossed in Will and Louisa's evolving relationship, however, and found myself staying up late into the night to find out their fate. Me Before You is a different kind of love story than anything I have read before; it is not epically romantic, but rather quietly normal. It is the kind of love that sneaks up on you, and before you know it everything your once knew has been shattered to pieces.  I loved this book.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|bought it for my friend who really loves it. I am slowly buying each previous season for her and her husband
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a nice story, with well-developed and interesting characters.  An easy and quick read, and a good book-club selection.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|bought it for my friend who really loves it. I am slowly buying each previous season for her and her husband
0345529057|5.0|I enjoyed reading these.  The only annoying thing is that George R. R. Martin isn't done with the series.  There will be at least a book 6 and 7 in the series and it, understandably, takes him a long time to write.  I expect book 6 to come out within a year but who knows how long it will be before we get a final book and find out the resolution of this series.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|First off, I LOOOOVE twitch. I watch it more than I watch real tv. Great streamers that are nice, funny, and entertaining. HOWEVER, this particular way is NO way to interface with them. First off, I only got the video to work like 2 times in the 20 or so that I tried loading a stream, most of the time only sound would come through, as if it were a radio show. Second, you cannot log into your twitch account and use your following list, or your paid account statuses to ANY result. Third, along side not being able to use your accounts, you cannot chat, and that is just sad.<br /><br />As I said, I love twitch enough to give this app a star, but that is it.
1615470158|5.0|Great resource for learning PowerPivot. Most importantly, real world examples are given, rather than contrived examples cooked up just to demonstrate. (I realize how difficult it is to provide real world examples, and I have been guilty myself of contrived examples in my podcast...). The book is well written and easy for those new to PowerPivot as well as those with more experience. I would also recommend visiting Rob's PowerPivot blog, [...] Great resource for further study after reading the book.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great examples<br />Easy to understand<br /><br />Cons:<br />None really... any further information not found in the book can be found at Rob's blog...
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I love the series and now I love this book....I can picture the people he is writing about, and it is just overall a great book so far!!
B004NOCCEG|4.0|This documentary provides its viewers with interesting, relevant, and important facts as to the collapse of the economy and it's slow recovery. It successfully points out conflicts of interest in the field of academic economics that lead to studies supporting disastrous policies, it detailed the specific causes of the financial collapse, and it called out dishonest practices within the baking industry.<br /><br />It isn't a perfect movie though. Matt Damon occasionally employes documentarian tricks that don't really constitute a good argument. Asking a lobbyist how he he would rate employee compensation in general and then pointing out specific counterexamples isn't really a fair tactic. Also, I think he fixated on executive compensation too much, when that really isn't relevant to the financial collapse itself.<br /><br />Still this movie is one more people should watch, if only so that we no longer remain ignorant of this important issue.
B004QSQML8|5.0|You can't beat Tim Curry's role as Darkness in this movie. He played the role flawlessly! No one has played a better devil.
B006ISJQ1W|1.0|Boring movie  I love Mr. Depps work but this movie was disappointing.  Not his acting but not his usual work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it but they should give you more items to pick up and collect and items should be a little cheaper or a little easier to get items
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Good story, good actors, fun to watch.  What more can I say?  Love all Johnny Depp movies. Don't have three more words.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Awesome- mind blowing- feel sorry for everyone who doesn't read even though they may be skeptical :) # read this or die
B004LROMQG|5.0|Once you start watching Merlin from season 1 your hooked.  You get absorbed in characters.  I have purchased all seasons & would recommend them all!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I was excited to read this novel because the film won so many awards and got such rave reviews.  However, the novel was pretty uneventful and definitely not a &#34;can't-put-it-down&#34; kind of read.  It wasn't terrible, but just not great like I was hoping.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|This is a great collection of new and old Boz Scaggs; his voice continues to be as good as ever.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Howey has done a fine job with this first novel. The characters, if somewhat cartoonish, are still compelling enough to make you care. The set up is interesting, and seems primed for more exploration.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I am very pleased with this watch. It is very well made, keeps time very accurately, and it didn't cost like a Breitling.<br /><br />My only concern, not enough to take away a star, is that Seiko provides no documentation on how to use the slide rule, either on paper with the watch, or online, at least that I have found. But slide rule watches are all pretty much the same, at least in concept, and so some Googling turns up well-written explanations. Here is one example:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Having gone to Stevens Tech in the early 1960s, I spent a lot of time with a slide rule in my hands. This watch brings back fond memories and appreciation of what a brilliantly simple device a slide rule is.
076115678X|4.0|The book gives the reader practical advice regarding how to manipulate your curlies.  The only problem I have with it is the &#34;trickle&#34; form of rinsing.  (Not sure it's actually called that, but if you read it you will see what I mean.) Rinsing your hair with splashes of water is just not efficient, and one ends up with more conditioner left than one would really want.  However, everything else in this book will help curly girls, including Bender's own way of typing your hair.  No &#34;3A&#34; or &#34;3B&#34; here. The book includes a short DVD in which the basic method is demonstrated and explained.  Don't think that the DVD is all you need.  The book itself is energetic and practical, and it got this curly girl to try new things.  I must admit that in conjunction with the book, I had my first Deva cut (fantastic), and I am now using Deva products, which are great.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|a slow and predictable storyline that does not do justice to the characters and wastes Harrison Ford.  This should have been fun
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Series has everything I look for in a science fiction series. Well written, good story lines, you never know what is going to happen.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|loved the books....fascinated with the visual spectacle! gave this four stars due to the fact that I am glad that I read the books as there are gaps in the show.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Each book is as great as the last.  Oliver's writing is beautiful, clean, and concise, and she has created characters that I genuinely cared about. Fabulous!
B006S08RLU|5.0|This is french comedy at it's very best.  Visually an absolute treat.  A little romance tossed with a lot of delightful characters and humour.  Highly recommended.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Game was fun, now I don't play it much. Time to go. It was fun while it lasted. Good for kids.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Disney already insulted us by announcing a sky-high price for a 3D-only package.  But it gets worse:  We now learn that the 3D-only package does not come with any extras at all.  At least, that's how I read their confusing press release.  Thus, Disney wants $$$$ for a package consisting of ONLY the 3D movie itself and a digital copy.  No 2D Blu-Ray, no DVD, no bonus content at all.<br /><br />The obvious conclusion is that Disney wants to position 3D as a high-priced specialty only for the rich and spoiled who will can afford to ALSO buy the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.
B009R659L8|4.0|Daddy's Gone A Hunting is another winner. Her books are exciting and keep you reading to the end. There are so many characters that I often have to go back and read it again.

B0064MGU98|5.0|The Good Wife is a well written lawyer drama that also has the side story of a political scandal.  Well acted and always interesting - it is some of the best tv on Anerican network tv.
0679721037|4.0|Hiroshima is an inspirational classic that displays the accounts given by survivors of the atomic bomb created by the United States. The reader is able to follow these victims through each crippled step during the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945. This novel specifically focuses upon the hardship of 6 people; two doctors, two women, and two religious men. The story starts hours before the bombing, includes personal accounts during the bombing, days after the bombing, and this edition includes tales of the survivors 40 years after the bombing in Hiroshima. The reading truly displays compassion and human connection. The atomic bomb killed 69,000 people and left 66,000 others slowly dying or severely injured. The reader has the privilege to learn how the characters were able to help and save the injured, whether those injured consisted of family, friends, or strangers. The characters must cope with conflicting morals when protecting themselves, and also attempting to help as many others as possible. I mainly enjoyed reading Hiroshima because it provided an impactful perspective on society. Although it can be easy to lose hope in a corrupt-seeming humanity, these tales display the compassion of real people, still alive today! The way this novel is put together is completely innovative effective. It seems to shed light on humble heroes who risked their already destroyed lives to help others. One, and possibly the only reason I disliked Hiroshima, was a sense of disorganization. It follows six characters, which is effective in showing different perspectives, although the shift between characters' viewpoints seemed scattered at times, and it became easy to confuse the characters with one another. Besides this minor fault, I strongly recommend others to read Hiroshima. As stated before, it enlightens the reader, displaying the unbelievable strength and compassion of human beings. Many barely know the truth, and the facts behind the event this book focuses on. Even those who do have more knowledge on the tragedy should read Hiroshima in order to obtain a new view, perhaps even a new opinion on the bombing. The book is moving to say the least, and should inspire everyone who reads it. I willingly give Hiroshima a rating of \\"four-out-of-five\\" stars. It is a wonderful collection of history and will positively, even educationally, impact everyone who experiences it..

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  Interesting characters that just get better as the book proceeds.  The book takes place in a post-apocalyptic<br />world where no one can survive outside a protected underground silo.  The silo is a world unto itself divided socially by skills.<br />Juliette and Lukas perform their duties within the silo until the all important ritual of &#34;cleaning&#34; goes terribly wrong.  What follows is exciting and interesting.  I cannot say that I was completely in the dark as to where the story was going, but there were enough surprises along the way to make the journey to the end of the book worth the effort.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|toatly worth your money  lots of suspense  it just feels likd i can see what the characters are seeing<br />great book
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Witty and addictive! If you have made it to this season two review then your more tham likely already hooked too. I just wish season four was prime!

0316044695|5.0|Nicely written and hard to put down...I highly recommend it to anyone who likes stories of determination and survival. I think this is going to make one of the best special forces movies ever made when it comes out later this year (assuming the director is able to capture what's described in the story sufficiently well). I can't recommend this book enough! 5 stars!

B009LMTDL0|4.0|This was a great read! Very empowering to women to encourage them to take on challenges and strive to get to the top. At the same time allowing for women to make that choice if being a working mother or stay at home mother.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I don't know why because every other app I've loaded has come seamlessly and quickly.  So I can't really say I hate it; I just don't have it!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Loved the play between Star Trek and the Intrepid. Wonderful ride. But of all the pieces in the book, I found the three codas to be the most touching. Best described as a smooth finish to a particularly bubbly glass of champaign.<br /><br />Well done

B006O6F932|3.0|Daughter saved up her money and bought this herself, me as the parent think it is over priced for you get.
B003ITZBVS|4.0|Batman Under the Red Hood is another film in the DC animated direct-to-DVD lineup. The last solo Batman film in this line-up was Batman Gotham Knight. I found that movie to be a disappointment, however, this film made up for it. I did not care for this film when I first watched it. However, when I viewed it again I loved it. This is definitely better than Gotham Knight. I even like this more than the Dark Knight Returns films. In fact this is probably the best film in the DC animated line-up so far.<br /><br />Under the Red Hood is based on the comic of the same name. Under the Red Hood begins with the death of Jason Todd at the hands of the Joker. Then it cuts to years later. This new villain called the Red Hood shows up in Gotham in an attempt to control crime in Gotham. Batman needs to confront this new villain and face up to his past with Jason.<br /><br />This film briefly covers Death in the Family and covers Under the Red Hood. The writer of the comic, Under the Red Hood is one of the people working on this film. I'm not familiar with the Red Hood comic. From what I hear it was not the best. Many people say that this is the definitive take on the Red Hood. From seeing this movie I can see why they think that. The writer of the original comic was involved because he wanted to make the story better, and many thought he succeeded. It is great to see someone get the opportunity to improve upon his work.<br /><br />The voice-acting took some getting used to. I'm so used to Kevin Conroy voicing Batman, that this new voice did not immediately sit right with me. However, seeing the film again I like the voice actor of Batman. Bruce Greenwood voiced Batman in this movie as well as Young Justice. He does a good job as Batman.<br /><br />Jensen Ackles, who voices Red Hood does a great job as well. I'm a fan of Jensen from the series Supernatural. The man has a wide range of acting talent. I wish he would get more work. Neil Patrick Harris does a decent job as Nightwing.Wade Williams as Black Mask was a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />However, John DiMaggio is probably one of my least favorite Jokers. He is definitely not up-to-par with Mark Hamill or Heath Ledger. I even like Jack Nicolson's Joker more. DiMaggio just did not sit right with me. I did not care for his voice, and I did not think he had any presence to him.<br /><br />The animation is great, besides a few CGI shots. The action is great and engaging. Although, one action scene with a certain villain, I felt, was out of place in this kind of movie.<br /><br />Overall this is a great Batman movie. If you are a fan of Batman and of the Red Hood comic, I highly recommend this.

B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Randomly stumbled upon some of her cover music on youtube, ended up buying this album of her originial songs the same day.  She's an excellent violinist and I love the combination of classical violin / hip hop / electronica / dance-pop / dubstep.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Once you embark on a so called spiritual journey, and start living with just a bit more awareness, you will start seeing some recurring themes. You will notice &#34;signs,&#34; hear stories that just rings true, and you will see more and more of the markers, all leading you to the same direction.<br />I'm quite analytical, but what Anita had to say slipped by my critical mind. Her words got past my brain's firewall, straight to my sole- my heart.<br />Anita is lucky, and so are the rest of us; for she was able to take a peak past our dimension, and bring us back the good news.<br />Thanks Anita. Thank you all.

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I really enjoyed this short tale from the world of Elantris. I recommend this book to all fantasy lovers whether you have read Brandon´s work before or not.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I love Sheryl Sandberg's mission in this book. Getting the discussion going about female leadership and visibility is the beginning of a long road ahead of us. I don't think my critiques of her book will be new but I think they should be repeated in order for this discussion to keep going. This is a woman who comes from a family of physicians, has had the best possible education and had mentors with big names (which she drops a lot so be prepared if you're not into that). Yes, if she didn't keep working hard she would never have made it to the top but I think where her path starts makes this book very unrelatable. She acknowledges this so I will give credit for this but I think few of these lessons are helpful for someone who isn't well educated, and in a place to choose how to sort the family/work dynamic.<br /><br />There is a LOT of discussion about children in this book. I think this perpetuates the idea that womens primary choices are between work and kids instead of moving away from that. Again, she is drawing from her own personal experiences but for someone who doesn't have children or doesn't want children this book will likely not be particularly helpful.<br /><br />I found the most helpful aspects were actually the research she points out throughout. Revealing the disparities exist outside her own experience. Her anecdotes, however, are cliche and come off as self-serving as opposed to inspiring (I would think the same if it came from a man mind you!). There are times that this book will infuriate you (not Sheryl but the things that happen to her and other women) and I think that's good. It's a nice step towards figuring out how to reverse the cultural problems we've had with gender equality. Your courage is appreciated, Sheryl!
0783230079|5.0|I love this movie and could not wait to watch it with my daughter. Happily I did not have long to wait.  The movie arrived in just a few days. The packaging was in perfect condition. The movie was also in perfect condition.
B006LSZECO|4.0|good I liked it. I was very entertaining and believable but I  would have like the ending better if she would have gotten her just dues.
B007Z9QP3K|4.0|Das Boot is a realistic portrayal of a U-boat and its crew in an extended WWII combat operation.<br />It vividly shows the terror of the sub crew under attack and also shows the horror of the allied cargo ships<br />being torpedoed and sunk. The movie is well done and does not give a glamorous picture of war.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|It was great.  I couldn't put the book down until I finished.  It was very entertaining.plus I learned alot about the masons.
B009K0P10K|5.0|i missed this episode so I was so glad to find out I could get it on my Kindle. I love this show and hate to miss anything and now I don't have to!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book! It was recommended to me by a friend. It's a little slower in the beginning, but totally gripping throughout the whole novel. If a book can move me to tears, it's a book you have to recommend! And I do so now!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I've been a Clancy fan for years, and this holds up to the test of his previous novels. Invariably, the premise of the novel is timely, accurate, and thought-provoking.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Excellent series with good plots and great acting. I recently began watching the current series on TV and wanted to see the 1st season.

B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Yet another great game from the folks at Zeptolab! Can't wait until they add more levels, I will keep playing for sure.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter who is a Hunger Games fan.  The detail on the doll is fantastic because it has all the features (accessories) of what the actress in the movie wore:  jacket with red lining, bow, arrows, arrow case and Mockingjay pin worn.<br /><br />My daughter enjoys playing with this doll and I will get the other character dolls to the movie that are out as well.  It is made with the good Barbie quality that other Barbie dolls are made with.  I think it was worth purchasing for my little Hunger Games fan.  ;)<br /><br />Warning though:  It does have small parts (the bow, arrows and I don't know if the pin would break off) so I wouldn't recommend this for a child that would still be curious about putting things in their mouth.
B000FC10MU|4.0|Gaiman' s attempt at writing a novel about America uses a unusual story to make solid observations about us. The basic story is that the Gods of old exist and our living amongst us. Once powerful, some of the older Gods lead desperate lives as their glory as faded since the people that worshipped them become ingrained in American life. Gaiman uses this entertaining story to offer a critical view of who we are and an encouraging statement of what we can become.

Allows my little MacBook 13&#34; to drive a 30&#34; cinema display, which breathed life back in to both. new use for two older pieces of hardware.

0345803485|1.0|I guess I feel pretty naïve after reading this book. I mean I had heard of this type of thing before but to read a whole book about that kind of life is too far from reality for me. I don't know what kind of people they are that gave this book high ratings!
B008WOULPK|4.0|Fun to read and learn about the fashion and magazine industry. It was fun to follow Grace through her experiences.
B00004WIDQ|5.0|This film is one of the top grossing movies of all time, and for good reason! It takes place on a small island off the coast of south America where a state of the art theme park is being constructed. However before it can open it's doors to the world it is to be inspected and approved by at least 3 specialists. After recruiting 2 archeologists and 1 chaos specialist, the overly confident owner and developer of the park gives the trio a grand tour in order to publicize his main attraction....live dinosaurs! However, awe turns to terror when a power shortage decapitates the central security system and allows the creatures to break free of their cages and threaten the lives of everyone in the park! Now the race is on to survive the outbreak and call for help before its too late!<br /> With amazing special effects and edge of your seat excitement, Jurassic Park is bound to amaze viewers for generations to come! Don't miss out!!!!!!

B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I love the game but it keeps notifying me at 3 am that there is a update, which amazon has not made available yet and there doesn't seem to be a way to turn this off.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you look at the reviews you we see over fourteen thousand reviews and about 3/4 of them are 5 star. This is an action packed book that I hope you like as much I do. But beware for you people who don't like blood or death make sure you have a flashlight when you read it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love having my Bible on the Kindle but you always have to be connected to wifi in order to read it. I hate that because there are times when I don't have a wifi connection and would like to read it but I can't.

B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My daughter loves this game, she can't get enough of it.<br />Great application for kids.  Will keep them very busy.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|It is a good family movie if your family like to watch movies. It does have a good story line and wraps up well at the end.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I would have to say that this is definitely on my top 3 list of games I've played on the kindle fire.
B004V9MU86|5.0|This book is written from death's viewpoint making it an interesting read, set in a volatile time period of World War two.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I am a huge fan of comedy, SNL, 30 Rock, and memoirs. This is a well written book that is funny and touching. The tone is like an old friend telling you about their day, it can make you laugh and aid you in reflecting on your own life. Tina Fey is an idol of mine, and reading her story gives me even more appreciation for her work as a comedian and writer. Bitch is the new black!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What loveable characters! And the plot twist...Devine (pun intended) While  working, I found myself thinking of the characters and wanting to ask them questions. I couldn't wait to get back to reading.<br />An enjoyable read that breaks your heart and lifts it up again!
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|I always order movies from amazon, via my Roku device.<br />mainly because of the sound and video clarity.<br />last night's viewing of Broken City the sound was great,but I found the video not to be as vibrant as usual.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Like most of the world, I loved this series.  I was lucky, I read the series one right after another as I came to the series after they were all done.  I loved them!
B000I5XOW8|4.0|This is a movie that I watched a bunch as I was growing up.  I recently bought it and watched it again for the first time in at least 10 years.  The movie is still great, the acting still looks great, only the weird 80s electronic music in the background dates it.  Definitely a must buy at this price, I picked it up for 3-4 bucks.  This would be a good gift for any HF fan!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|One of the better bands of today! Imagine Dragons has such a great sound!! This is the first CD that I have gotten from them, and I love it!! Each song is different and has great potential to be hits with every single. I would recommend this to those that are looking for music that is easy to listen to, with great catchy hooks!<br /><br />Christopher Berry
B009MYARIK|5.0|I am never disappointed when I read Sophie's books. This book was no different. The story was fast paced and a delightful read. The two main characters are strong enough to keep the story line interesting in the entire book. Read this if you are looking for a fun and entertaining read.
B001BC5HXG|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. It can be lovely, evocative, and honest, but also ham-fisted, redundant, and shallow.<br /><br />By and far, the best parts were Steinbeck's descriptions of the Salinas Valley. These were like little prose poems of moments and places, seasons and rhythms. I have read one of the author's missions while writing this book was to record the region for his children so they would know every sensory detail of the valley. I think he accomplished this.<br /><br />Beyond these love letters to a place, the book revolves around a couple families, torn apart and joined together by tragedies and triumphs of all kinds. Steinbeck cribs the plot devices of Cain and Abel--a jealous brother \\"kills\\" his sibling--and adds his own thoughts on free will versus inherited wickedness. And there is wickedness in this book. Some of the characters were so terrible, so despicable, so evil that it sometimes soured the book for me. On the other hand, there were characters who were quite fun to read about (especially Samuel Hamilton and Lee) and chapters about them helped me forget about the rotten ones.<br /><br />I know Steinbeck considered this his best book. I know many people deeply adore and respect it. However, I really felt like it got far too preachy and obvious. Steinbeck has us go through the saga of fraternal conflict twice, through two generations, and by the time the first conflict is over, I was tired of the book. The second generation story just felt redundant. Some of the characters and dialogue felt very real and truthful to human nature, while others edged too far into stereotype and unbelievability. This opinion goes for the plot points, too.<br /><br />As others have said, when Steinbeck is writing about the landscape of California and the family inspired by his own, he does lovely work. It's when he focuses on his (quite obvious and belabored) allegory that the book fails.
B009G41CG2|4.0|I love passing time with this game on my Kindle fire!  It has lots of puzzle combinations to choose from and adverts aren't intrusive while playing.

B000ICXQGK|5.0|Simply put, if you believe or Know of or Know in a Spiritual Reality, this movie will touch you deeply.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Delightful P.G Woedhouse comedy of the social classes.  Bertie Wooster is a clueless spoiled young man who is rescued from himself, time after time after the incredibly lucky act of hiring Jeeves, the perfect manservant who is brilliant, insightful and perfectly understated.  We soon find out who's really the boss, although Bertie never really does.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|The idea and premis was pretty spectacular, but something was missing.  Some parts of the movie seemed like a cop out, but others were visually fantastic.  The special effects and the make up to make the lead actors look alike was amazing.  All-in-all an almost great movie.
B009R659L8|5.0|mary higgins clark is my favorite author and again she has written another great mystery!can't wait for her next book.
B008476HBM|5.0|What's not to love about Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.  It was about time I read this book, and I enjoyed it as much as the generations before me.  Elizabeth Bennet is a modern woman-- a wonderful character to befriend.
B009R659L8|3.0|I found it easy to put down and reading other books and authors like James Patterson and Catherine Coulter always<br />have so much suspense it is hard to quit reading when I start their books
B005DI66N4|4.0|it might not be a true story (see wikipedia en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Walk‎). But the story is engrossing, and very well written.<br /><br />For me, it is too well writtent o be a true story. but who cares? is anybody going to run the 4,000 miles following the book?
B009K86D86|2.0|The movie has liberal tendencies.  It provides some good solutions to the issues.  It's informative in that it gives you some things to research on your own.  Would have given five stars if it was more balanced and was without an agenda.  Watched because I was required by a class.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Great writing makes a great movie.  Add that with a stunning visually pleasing movie and mix in some laughter, you got a hit.  All the leading men do a fantastic job transporting us to early America.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Got as free app of the day over a year ago and knew nothing about it.<br />I was instantly impressed. It has grown to be an even more powerful app as time progressed and updates were pushed.<br />I would buy it if I did not receive for free.

B0070DOHQS|5.0|Finally something USEFUL as a faotd!! I can't believe how easy this was to set up. It will come in incredibly handy when I need files from my home computer at work...no more calling up my husband to beg him to email me something!

B003NB8KE6|5.0|I recently did a comparison of recovery type tights.  I believe that a big part of it is how the tights fit you, and everyone fits differently, but here are my thoughts.<br /><br />Skins Men's RY400 - My winner.  They provide great compression - snug, but not uncomfortable.  They fit very well and are very comfortable, the best of all I've tried.  I like that they are thin so if I wear them under my pants, I won't sweat too much.  So, thin + good compression + good comfort = my favorite compression tights.<br /><br />CW-X Men's Perform X Tights - My runner up favorite.  They provide good compression and the compression seems to be in the right spots.  They fit nicely, though they are a little thick, I would be very happy with this one.<br /><br />Zoot Sports Men's Ultra 2.0 CRX Tights - I really liked these, they have the best compression and the compression seems to be the best targeted as well - tight where you need it and not tight where you don't (knees).  Having said that, they are not the most comfortable to wear walking around under your pants and they are very very thick, almost like medical type tights.  I think this would be a big problem in summer.  So if the thickness doesn't bother you and you don't really plan to use them under any pants to walk around, I think they are really great for sitting around the house for recovery.<br /><br />2XU Men's Compression Tights - ok, but a little hard to pull over my feet because of the small foot opening.  Nothing spectacular on the compression, but seemed to fit ok and although not my favorite, I believe they would work.<br /><br />Orca Men's Killa Kompression Tights - I really wanted to like these, because my tri suit is Orca, but they just were not so comfortable, not so great with compression, and really really hard to get on my legs because the foot opening is so small.<br /><br />UPDATE: Having worn the Skins tights for a few months now, I am very happy with them!  After a hard workout I wear them to sleep and the next morning I feel much better.  They really do work!

0307594009|5.0|I had not planned on writing a critique of this book but I had to.  I just read that a woman, a mother of a 7th grader was trying to have the \\"diary\\" banned from schools and libraries as she finds it pornographic.  Her daughter's class has been assigned to read the book and she says her daughter and herself find it offensive.  Frankly I doubt either of them have any idea of the books true content.  I have read the \\"Diary Of Anne Frank\\" numerous times since I was 14.  I am now 65.  Anne was without doubt an intelligent girl and forced to live in horrific times and under horrific circumstances.  From the age of 13 until they were discovered 2 1/2 years later, she and her family, another family and a dentist lived in cramped quarters in an attic.  Without the help of courageous friends they would never have made it as long as they did.  Sadly they were discovered and all but Anne's father survived the concentration camps. A tale of frank pain, some humor at times, telling the difficulties of a young teen during the worst time in history.  I never fail to cry at the end.  I never fail to recall Anne's words, of faith and hope, \\" I still believe that people are good at heart.\\"  Hopefully the mother and daughter I speak of will read the diary together, and talk about it.  But for the grace of God, it could have been them.  Anne's diary is the greatest story ever told in my opinion, along with all the other survivors of the Holocaust and their telling and heart breaking tales.  Let us hope it is never forgotten.  A book that is one of the best!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Rise of the Guardians has a timeless under-story with a modern twist and amazing animated delivery! The graphics are impeccable,  the dialogues are mature enough for an audience if any age, the jokes are hilarious and the characters are unique. This was the best version of Jack Frost I've ever seen!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|I love this movie.  The dvd I had became stuck in my dvd player.  I had to damage it to get it out.  The next day, I ordered another copy.

B00AYDC5HY|2.0|Tim Burton needs to relax and write. Frankenwinne a movie about a boy and his dog which dies and he brings it back to life, boring<br />It did not even keep my 5 year old entertained. I would recommend this move. Unless you are not sleeping well and need help getting to sleep
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I love the new show Vikings which is based on the legendary viking Ragnar Lodbrok. Costumes, makeup and props seem true to the time period. I would recommend this show to all persons who enjoy a good tale of adventure!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|What an enjoyable story.  I saw it on TV before purchasing the DVD so I can watch it anytime I want.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I always look for material by Blake. I watch him on the Voice and listen to how he coaches his team as well. This guy knows what he is doing.
B004I1K2NW|5.0|I know The Frighteners came out, what seems like eons ago. We all know the story on how it served as Peter Jackson's resume for his ambitiously grand visits to Middle-Earth. I will be focusing my review on those of you who may have never heard of this little piece of celluloid wonder. And, as you can probably deduce by mu previous sentences and star rating, I love 'The Frighteners'. I will admit to being a huge admirer of Peter Jackson. Having followed his work since 'Bad Taste' and 'Meet the Feebles'. I still consider this an unbiased review because there are couple of his films I am not that keen on ('Heavenly Creatures' and 'The Lovely Bones').<br /><br />What you want to know though, is, \\"Why does this motion picture work and how?\\". Let me tell you, it works on all fronts. Visually this film is stunning. Shot in his native New Zealand. The topography is as picturesque as you could imagine. Is it on par with LOTR? No. But it doesn't need to be because the locations in this film are not as sprawling as LOTR. The locales here are specifically constrained and contained to fit and drive the story deliberately. The sets have that dusty, lived in realness. Some minimalists, some 'regular every day Joe' type,  and some old Victorian/gothic-esque. And the mood isn't all coming from what you see. Danny Elfman did a tremendous job with the score for it helps control the tone of the film. Despite the horrors and peril that is contained within, this is a black comedy. This film will make you laugh. A lot of that is attributed to the intrinsically light hearted and wit-filled writing of the script; but the score does what a score does best...It paces the mood and compliments the words that are uttered, whether They're uttered or not. The acting is top notch. Jeffrey Combs was cast in a role he was meant to play. I met Mr. Combs at a horro convention just prior to shooting 'The Frighteners' and he had mentioned how much he loved his role and that we'd all be blown away by thisfilm. Herbert West was right on the money! Then you have Mr. Fox, who's consistently above par and lets not forget Mr. Ermey as Sgt. Hiles. Think 'Full Metal Jacket' and you know what to expect from The gunny. And I don't mean to leave out Jake Busey, John Astin, Trini Alvarado, Chi McBride...The performances are solid top to bottom.<br /><br />The visual effects are also amazing. Considering CG effects were still relatively young back then you will be impressed with the level of quality they display. I see CG today that is terrible compared to what Weta pulled off with 'The Frighteners'. Top notch indeed.<br /><br />So in conlusion...If you're not a prude. If you don't take life too seriously you will enjoy 'The Frighteners', it will make you laugh. You will find yourself smiling throughout the film. A couple of hours very well spent!<br /><br />-Orlando G Acosta
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good reading but maybe a little to bazaar.  It was entertaining.  The author has the makings of a great mystery writer.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I loved this one as much as my granddaughter did. the story line plot and the idea of a hotel for monsters was great.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book to read to help understand what we really want, and what we need to fulfill our emotional needs.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This book has helped me look at how to evaluate all of the interlocking pieces that make today's business environment so complex and difficult to manage.  The truth was spoken about how people, processes and technology can both hinder or bolster a business and did a good job of showing the ripple effects of any business action.  I found instant parallels to my work situation and see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and it doesn't have to be the train.  A very well written and compelling novel and worth a read for anyone in IT/InfoSec or even business folk who don't understand those IT/InfoSec folk.
B00B19DW0E|3.0|Not as good as I thought I remembered.  Special effects dated by today's standards.  Single story line.  Script weak and heroes and villains one-dimensional.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|I will not cover the plot or give away any spoilers here! If you want the plot you can read a full synopsis on IMDB or Wikipedia. I saw this film a few years back but never actually picked it up. Now, and of course, Vikings series on History Channel partly to blame, I've been on a mission to watch as many Norse-inspired films as possible.<br />There aren't that many good ones I'm afraid. There's the Kirk Douglas classic 'The Vikings', the almost passable '13th Warrior' and Pathfinder; which I actually quite enjoy. Then there's Beowulf & Grendel. Let me tell you, this film works! It has breathtaking locations (Iceland), quality acting by all but one or two actors (which is not bad<br />considering there are quite a few), a well placed score and well paced dramatic story arch. This film is easily worthy of better scores than given on IMDB or Metacritic. My one gripe with the film would be that the end sort of works itself out and never really reaches any type of climax or cathartic moment. Even as the tension within the<br />story arch swells. I wasn't expecting explosions or sinister plot twists or anything like that. Just a little more 'oomph'. But that's really a minor gripe because the rest of the film is so well done that it won't matter much to you once you reach the final destination and find yourself on the last reel.<br /><br />So, if you like period pieces that have authentic sets and wardrobes, mixed in with elements of the oldest piece of fantasy hero literature recorded. You will enjoy this little, under appreciated gem.<br /><br />-Orlando

You got right into the book in the first paragraph..............Excellent Reading.............Jo-Ann
B00BQ1D90A|5.0|Now despite me putting a 5 star as a review, that would be for the actual music its self. Im a big fan of Junip and have been for awhile now. I am disappointed and sad to say that the vinyl on amazon is black, i was expecting for the blue since that was the one there were releasing everywhere else. I wish amazon would let us know before buying. Anywho I will be returning my copy (never been played nor used the download code) to buy the blue one somewhere else.

Can't wait for the next season my only complaint is how long I have to wait to watch the newest episodes you all usually have them up by 1AM PST but sometime they wouldn't be up until way later in the day totally unfair I think we should get a little more off the episode when that happens
B005IQZB14|3.0|This book was a quick read and filled my hiking bug during the winter months. I would recommend this book.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|i really enjoyed this movie.  it's a lot more than a movie trying to bank on nerdy video game nostalgia (i probably would have seen it just for that but it was quality).  definitely a movie you can watch with children and not get nauseous.  that last bit doesn't sound like a glowing review, but it's awesome.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was my first game like this.  I found it to be fun and I wanted it to continue on.
B002RI9X8S|5.0|Without stories like this one, the terrible history of the Okies might not be remembered.  Between Steinbeck and Woody Guthrie, their stories are told in gritty, determined detail.<br /><br />I read this when I was a teenager a long time ago.  I remember being close to Rose of Sharon, the teenage mother-to-be in the book, distanced from Ma and Pa and watching Tom from a distance.<br /><br />Reading this again in my more 'golden years', having lived a transient life in the 1980s and 1990s, my recognition came from a different angle.  Understanding the stoicism of Ma as she collects her brood along the way, letting go of precious things because there was no choice, watching the dilemmas of her children ~ the book was no less moving but moreso.<br /><br />Their hope through hopelessness, making do and surviving with that fierce determination is as strong today (2013) as it was when I read it in the 1960s, and when he wrote it in the mid 1900s.  This book is history and it makes history come to life.

B002PEP4U0|5.0|There are two parts to this book. The hardships of African life is explained in a simple yet in a telling manner. It is shocking to see how a large section of people are struggling for their next meal while the other side of the world lavishes in luxury. The second part is the determination of a boy, despite of various setbacks used science to fulfil the basic needs of his village<br /><br />A truly inspirational read !!

0439023521|4.0|You can see my full review, as well as many others on my blog The Dancing Nerd Writes Again.<br /><br />*I was required to read this book for my Literature and War class.<br /><br />Initial Thoughts:<br /><br />This was my second time reading The Hunger Games and after seeing the movie multiple times. I was very familiar with the work, but when I read it this time, through the eyes of a critical reader, the experience was extremely different. As a novel to read for pleasure, I found that I enjoyed the story much more than I did when I was required to read it for class and dissect the literary aspects of the characters and plot.<br /><br />Spoilers!<br /><br />I'm assuming anyone who wanted to read this book already has or has seen the movie so this section isn't going to discuss spoilers as much it is going to discuss the differences in the way I interpreted the novel the second time around.<br /><br />One of the main things I disliked when reading the novel this time, was Katniss and Peeta's relationship. To be clear, I wasn't annoyed with how their relationship progresses in this novel, but having read the entire series I'm simply frustrated with the way I know their relationship will turn out. Throughout The Hunger Games Katniss repeatedly mentions that she doesn't want kids, doesn't want a relationship with Peeta or anyone, and yet it is forced upon her. I also think their relationship takes away from the overall message of the book, and depletes the integrity of the story. I felt like the relationship was only added to appease the targeted, young adult audience.<br /><br />We discussed this aspect of the novel many times in class, and even though a few students argued for the relationship, saying that it was an interesting challenge Katniss had to overcome and deal with in order to survive, it still doesn't sit well with me. Again, I'm not as upset by the relationship displayed in this novel as I am with the ones in the later novels, but I'll leave that for another review.<br /><br />Another thing that annoyed me while reading this time was realizing how much Collins `told' the reader instead of `showing' us. I felt like the book was dumbed down in some ways and that the author or publisher assumed the audience wouldn't be able to interpret or comprehend Katniss' actions, so she told us everything that was happening, instead of letting us come to our own conclusions.<br /><br />I didn't mean for this review to turn into a rant, so I'll try and turn it around. The things I really enjoyed about the novel is the fact that I hate that I enjoyed it. By liking this book, I'm playing right into Collins trap and becoming no better than a member of the Capitol. I think it's amazing that this book, while showing us the horrors of the Capitol and of the Hunger Games, pulls us in and reverses the situation, making us, the consumers and readers and everyone who saw the movie, observers and willing audience members of...well, the Hunger Games. It's such a brilliant and existential concept that I'm having a hard time adequately explaining it, but hopefully you get what I'm hinting at.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I'll openly admit that I enjoyed this book much more the first time, when I was 17 years old and reading it for fun. Picking it up again and reading it critically and analyzing every sentence, every plot twist or character motivation, has definitely given me a new and drastically different perspective.<br /><br />I think what Collins was able to accomplish with this novel, and through the movie, is an amazing feat that leaves audience members and readers alike examining the world we live in and contemplating what could happen. I'm excited to go and reread the second and third book in the series before the movies come out, and wondering what I'll like or dislike about those novels after I've read them more critically.<br /><br />Rating:4/5 stars
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|First Reacher novel and also  for me it is  first  from Lee Child.<br /><br />Good pace and  simple language keep you reading continuously.<br /><br />Overall a weekend  read !

B0027MJU00|4.0|This book starts off a bit slow, however, I love the main character and her dark secrets!<br />This is the third book I read of this author, and I'm afraid to say that &#34;Gone Girl&#34; is much better (a must-read, actually).<br />But this book is a great experience :)

1457514508|5.0|One of the great things about fiction is its ability to take you up and out of yourself for the briefest of time and transport you into a world that is so drama-filled that it makes you smile and excited to turn the next page. That is what Duncan Whitehead did for me with this book THE GORDONSTON LADIES DOG WALKING CLUB.<br /><br />We are given a cast of characters full of their own problems and human failings that are so familiar to us that we might see parts of ourselves in their happenings along the way. No matter what kind of novel you are used to reading I think you will find something in this one that suits your fancy. Whether it is the antics of the Gordonston ladies themselves or the men that find themselves in and around their lives. I think the old saying proves true here that you can't judge a book by its cover---no matter how much fun you might have in trying.<br /><br />There is love. There is hate. There is betrayal. There is passion. There's something that will make you laugh and want more.<br /><br />THE GORDONSTON LADIES DOG WALKING CLUB is a book that has all the makings of a great movie for its twists and turns and characters that are larger than life. Believe me when I say there is never a dull moment with the Gordonston Ladies, and that makes it a read you will not only enjoy but want to share with others.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|If you want a more completed version of the book, watch the Swedish and American versions. I think you will understand the story better.
0062119044|2.0|I used big words for my title because the author used big words to write this book.  The way that the author chose to tell the story was also tedious.  The author had her main character, Eva (Kevin's mother) tell the story by writing letters to her estranged husband.  The story was only told from her point of view.  The writing itself was awful.  There was big word usage for the sake of just using big words.  Eva is supposed to Armenian,  not born or raised in this country.  However, she used words that half of english born speaking americans have never come across.<br /><br />I can't imagine what would make the author write this kind of book.  Was her purpose to try and get me to sympathetic to the adolescents who go and shoot up their schools?  Was her purpose to get me to feel bad for their parents?  I mean after all the parents of these psycho kids are victims too.  She might have got me to feel sorry for Kevin's parents, but they themselves were horrid people.  I hated every character in this book, except for the little girl Celia.  She was too innocent to be able to hate.  As a parent, if I had a 6 year old child who was still in diapers due to his own choosing (meaning there is no medical reason the child would still need diapers- I understand that some children have physical disabilities that can cause this ) I would be concerned.  I would have been concerned around the age of 4 for that matter.  Kevin's parents just chose to let this go.  This is one of many warning signs that Kevin had the ability to control people by his actions.  Each warning sign was blaring red, yet all were ignored.<br /><br />The families of the victims that Kevin killed were made out to be the crazy nut people of the story.  How does that work?!  Kevin kills their children and they are the pretentious ones?  Eva sees herself as more of a victim than Laura Woolford's mom.  Are you kidding me?!<br /><br />If you can get past the horrible style that the way this book is written, it does have some surprises.  A few of the surprises may give me nightmares.  It is books and movies like this that make more adolescents want to do these horrible acts of killing.  The author herself is fully aware of this.  She mentions it in the book.  She talks about every school shooting that has happened between the years of 1997-2000.  Kevin keeps track of all of them in his head.  He is very upset that the Columbine shooters killed more people than he did.  WHAT?!<br /><br />My book club picked this book.  I must say that I am disappointed in the choice and this book.  I do not recommend it to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! It's very useful and I love the live notes connected with my church. What a blessing this app is!
1616550414|4.0|This book is pretty much an encyclopedia of Zelda lore and concept art. It is enriched with many drawings and notes made from every Zelda game up to Skyward.<br /><br />The notes written down in this book are detailed, allowing the readers to explore the Zelda lore by simply reading them and looking at the images. There are also statements written by the creators of Zelda, saying their thoughts and sharing their love for the franchise. Also including at the very end of this book, includes a non-canon manga prequel of Skyward Sword, featuring the first hero and the Goddess. It is a simple 1 chapter story, but also is an entertaining, good read. Unfortunately, there are some aspects to this book which happen to disappoint.<br /><br />Although there are notes and images for every Zelda game in this book, few games hardly have any information to show off to the readers. The Oracle series and DS games happen to have the fewest amounts of information, while Skyward Sword and Ocarina of Time each have over 20 pages of information. It is obvious that this book favors the more popular titles as it gives them the spotlights and pushes away the lesser known titles. Some amounts of information through out the book, happen to merely be speculation or rumors, not actual facts of the lore.<br /><br />Overall, this Historia packs a ton of great lore of the Zelda franchise into an Encyclopedia, with stunning images and artwork never seen before. For the price it is worth on Amazon, it is, of course, a great deal for any Zelda fan. I would recommend this book to any who are fans of collecting or of exploring lore.
B005KELQEU|5.0|Perfect. Just what he wanted.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|A fairly scholarly and well written look at what the author posits to be the turning point of modern secular thinking, an epic poem written in about 50 BCE, and how this poem was lost and then rediscovered and brought to light in the middle ages by several remarkable individuals, with one person in particular covered in depth. Very interesting from a  historical standpoint, with Kings, Popes, heroes and scoundrels  all involved.  But this is not a general over view of the origins of modern thought (which isn't all that new), only that this poem was the singular event.  Even if his premise is correct, which he doesn't  convincingly prove,  I would have hoped for a broader perspective.
B0031Q0XCA|2.0|Scatter and disarray is what I'd call this movie guess that why I've never heard of it.  The movie has nothing to keep u watching past the intro.
0802473156|3.0|Helps to understand what loves means so many different things to different people.  Should be used in a marriage prep class.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|In this movie you join the German u boat 'wolfpack system' at its decline. the older and more experienced commanders are few and far between as the Allies have come up with many successful tactics to destroy Germany's U-boat tactics. Most of the story is told form inside the German sub in very claustrophobic conditions. You can practically smell the harrowing B.O. coming off of the German crew (shared bunks,crabs, no bathing faciilities for weeks at a time) and the tension of being shelled underwater during an attack only adds to the cold sweat tension. I wish there were more movies like this told from the opposing side and that young americans would have the patience and wisdom to see them. There really is so much to be learned from knowing history.
1401235417|5.0|Scott Snyder managed to pull off a bang to this new story, with its new idea of a threat towards the Batman and Gotham.<br />The dialogue and script of this book was well written, but not the best. It's great, but there can be some issues that made me question, but it is all matter of opinion.<br />The artwork is extravagant. Greg Capullo is great for what he does and after reading this, I've began to love his work.<br /><br />Great story and great art, what else can I say about this book? I would recommend this to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ok. The appearance of this app will fool ya. Its waaaay better than it looks. It looks like some game an elementary schooler made. But no, its awesome.
B009IA9OLE|1.0|I read the first five reviews and then I made the purchase.  I now know what those reviews were for.<br />I am convinced they were not true players but simply shills to talk up the game.  It is horrible.<br />There is NO concept of trial.  Just boxes with numbers that you click on.  The game could have been called Two Rocks.<br />Amazon should refund for such trash.  They will lose mine.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I loved this tale. I read all four parts in less than two weeks. It is a great story that keeps the reader constantly engaged, with very few lulls.<br /><br />My critique would be that Rice tends to repeat herself a lot. She is constantly delving into the thoughts of her characters to explain things that have already been explained... to death.<br />The only other hiccup is the editing; there tends to be words missing here and there and bad punctuation in some parts. Also, once or twice, Rice accidentally confuses whether she is writing in past or present tense.<br /><br />However, despite these flaws, I truly did love the series. Enough to give it four stars.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I'm really pleased with how fast and smooth this program runs.  It lets  you add  multiple locations so you can see weather wherever you please.  Page display is great as is radar.
1844257797|4.0|The book is useful.  I had a battery charging issue.  The book says basically how to remove the alternator by the screws.  It does not say where the alternator on the 1150RT is.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the kind of book that you can not put down. So many nights I found myself wanting to keep reading all night. I cannot wait to read the other books Gillian Flynn has written.
B00633W614|5.0|Loved the continuing story.<br />I love reading books like this.<br />I will recommend it.  Just not happy that I can't share with my husband!  That's not right.<br />If it was a paperback I could share with anyone.  Not happy with that facet of Kindle books.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyway one esp people who like Mahjong. The games are challenging and go on and on. Very good game
0439023521|1.0|Perhaps it's just a preference, but I'm not really into the whole dystopian society kind of book. But I read The Hunger Games anyway because I'd heard good things.<br /><br />I started reading, and immediately was bored, but I continued because I assured myself it would get better-- or why else would so many people adore it?<br /><br />Well I soon found that just because it is a well known book doesn't make it a GOOD book. I love to read, and I'm open to different genres, but this book was complete rubbish for me.<br /><br />It was extremely boring and I didn't care much for any of the characters. I had to force myself to read at one point, but I eventually gave up.<br /><br />I'll admit-- the plot sounds promising at first glance, but the author just wasn't able to make it work. The book didn't pull me in, didn't make much sense, and frankly bored me to death.<br /><br />The Hungers Games was basically a really bad wannabe action movie, but far worse. What makes it worse is that the author went on to write another book, and created a trilogy. I'm fed up with hearing about this book and movie. I did see the movie, and it was equally as bad. It was a regrettable decision.<br /><br />Throughout the book I kept wondering why Katniss didn't just kill herself. I know that sounds harsh but she was so miserable and it reflected throughout, and she lived in a mindless dystopian society that didn't have any qualms about fighting children to the death for amusement. The whole idea seemed ridiculous and unlikely to me, too fictional but trying to be real-- and it just doesn't work.<br /><br />The book TRIES to catch your emotions but the only emotion I felt while reading was boredom. I literally had to force myself to finish at some points. I felt that the author could have made the book more interesting and make it not sound like a history textbook.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|I have not seen the original, yet certain reviews and some friends adviced me to go for the remake one and wow! I didn't regret my decision. After watching it, I hardly cared whether it was a remake or not. 'I spit on your grave' is one such film where you can't help but appreciate and applaud for excellent direction and good cast performances, infact the entire film moves on with a very genuinely spooky atmosphere throughout. Speaking of performances, Sarah Butler gives a brilliant one here, very real and very much into the shoes of the character she plays, her revenge scenes will surely blow you off, apart from that, it's her strong characterization that really grabs your entire attention. The rest of the cast does likewise well enough to give great support to Butler. Last but not the least person to mention is the director himself, Steven Monroe, the man responsible for such a brilliant horror treat witnessed by us. 'I spit on your grave' proves that horror films have taken a more advanced and explicit turn than the rather usual stereotype. Hats off to you Mr Monroe!
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This works well with our Wii. We have bought two of them. I love the longer cord. The cord is long enough so that it doesn't interfere when we play Double Dash.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Every great story must arrive at its ending, eventually. I like to think that RJ would be pleased with Brandon's work to complete the saga for those of us who continued to follow the Wheel of Time.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I attempted to test drive this app and nothing seemed to work.  The instructions are useless.  I could not get maps, radar, and other features that were advertized.  Would have liked to have down loaded, but if the real thing is this bad, why bother?
B007W8S2MG|5.0|The improvements made to the Vita version make this game even better than it previously was, which is saying something.
1416511946|5.0|I got this for my teenage son, and he was absolutely thrilled with it, couldn't put it down and finished it in about a week. For a kid that flat out wont read, I think that is wonderful! Im still trying to get him to let me borrow it, seemed like an interesting story.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It had it's funny moments, but mostly heart warming!! It is a movie I could watch again.
B007SGM084|5.0|The book started off slow for me but it soon had me on the edge of my seat. It provided everything I would want to read and I found myself totally smitten by Ana and Christian! I want more!
B000MGUZKM|5.0|Simply Magic. What a wonderful collection of tunes. Randy's heavenly voice and Joe's stellar playing a must have in one's library. Fun, romantic and memorable.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the intrigue in the book, the back and forth between the two main characters, BUT, I thought the ending was very weak. Surely the author could have come up with a better ending.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Works well with  my Kindle fire,  whereas the other top rated app didn't seem accurate.  It looks pretty cool too :)
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I'm not much of a 007 fan, overall the action was good. Just something about the movie didn't quite click with me. It was also a bit long. I kept thinking it was going to end, and it felt like it never did.
0891349553|5.0|Just like Katherine Dewey's book on sculpting the human figure, this book is a simple beak-down on creating animals.  I figured it would be fantastic, and I was not disappointed.  She breaks down the animals in a simple step-by-step instruction with beautiful illustrations and pictures so that anyone can create their own animal.  She is a true artist and a true teacher with a unique gift.  I highly recommend this book.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />-Annemarie Wright
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Season 2 moved but still dragged on in places. It made you want to scream at the characters at time which means that it's got that prime time TV draw.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching it and will continue watching more of the show.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|Good Story and Plot, however some of the character acting left much to be desired.  Tom Hank's character is horrible at european accents and muddles his word as if an american is doing a poor impersonation of a true european.
0307730697|5.0|This book is about a man that is not just a fine example of a warrior, but that of a father, husband, son and friend.<br />You will learn the meaning of what a true hero is, and most importantly you will hopefully learn some valuable life lessons<br />as to how to live life and what it means to be a human being and find strength to do so.<br />God Bless Adam Brown and his family, thank you!
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Typical and predictable Quentin Tarantino movie. Back story was lacking and failed to build a connection between the audience and the characters.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I like the style of blending the two different time frames of the same story line.  Pause for thought as to just how far we would go to in the love of our children.  Good Discussion material.

B0095VPBM2|5.0|this was my first build my old computer was super slow and outdated and it would boot unbuntu in 10 mins. i rebuild it with this cpu with 4 gb ram i can restart and reboot in 30 seconds. only one time i got the cpu usage to 92% and that was burning a dvd and watching youtube
B00CBBXOQ8|4.0|This is a great pop album with a nice retro vibe to it. Olly has a great voice and is demonstrated quite well. There are a few amazing tracks and plenty of good ones as well. The deluxe songs are on par with the rest of the album making it a great value. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the flow seems off and I keep catching myself picking and choosing the same 4 to 5 songs instead of playing from start to finish. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of pop especially those getting in to the current British invasion!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is really cool so far. Just getting started but so far really like it good graphics and easy to follow

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Slick, civilized, violent. No weakness. Cast first rate. The book is very well written. I liked it better than the Swedish original,<br />And then, I never get tired of looking at Robin Wright. Really enjoy Danial Craig,  Rooney Mara was dangerous. The rest of the cast were excellent.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|This thing is cool. If you like your tone crunchy, this is the one to get. I rarely play clean and when I'm walking around or practicing during a quiet time, I want it to be loud and heavy - and it is. Don't let the &#34;metal&#34; tag fool you, this one gets great classic rock tones too.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|What makes it even more fun for me and my grandkids was seeing the movie Rio.  You just can't find a more entertaining game series than Angry Birds.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This is my first attempt to use the new Prime free online viewing.  It was so much easier than my Xfinity..Just lay in bed late and night and indulged my appetite for scifi series I had missed some how. And without the commercials.<br />Now on to the review.<br />Noah Wylie is such a wonderful actor that he really disappears into the roles. And to see him without commercials.  Of course like all commercial TV productions, the action is timed to rise and fall with the commercials times, so  it is odd when the break you are dreading...doesn't come.<br />The aliens have landed and they find us very unwilling to host their infants(?), who attach to the spinal cord.  Wylie plays a widower with two surviving sons, and as we discover in this premiere episode, has a third that has apparently survived the invasion afterall.<br />I was very disappointed to discover that only the first part of this first episode is available.  So be prepared to either shell out money for the rest of the first season or haunt TNT or SyFy in hopes of finding this some late night, where all scifi series apparently gain a second life.  The second season IS available for free, and am looking forward to the character development.<br />With Noah Wylie one can't go wrong in that category.<br />The military action does fail in that thousands of rounds are fired and no one seems to find a shortage of ammo or some new way to kill the aliens, in the midst of survival. But this is the first episode so perhaps the answer is out there.<br />The secondary action that being teenage angst, is pretty lame and likely drawing all sorts of groans from the younger viewers. And what is with the hair on that blond.  We are talking survivalist action here, and as usual, her coiffure is straight out of Rodeo Drive.  I say that because it caused the same reaction in me when I watched Revolution.  I have long curly hair and it would be a real killer in any militaristic survival action...tangles in machinery, whips into the eyes.<br />It may seem as though I did not enjoy this one.  Loved the aliens and their scary stomp. These were worth the viewing, very imaginative.  But see it.  You'll like it.  And hopefully someone out there will get the message and chop off that hair. At least invest in some rubber bands. And where does that endless supply of ammo come from?e eyes.<br />It may seem as though I did not enjoy this one.  Loved the aliens and their scary stomp.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|Easy to understand with very useful information. Not only does it give you a workout & nutrition plan, it also explain the why behind the structure of the program. This way, if you don't want to follow the program given, you can just create your own plan because you now have an idea how.
B003F1WM2K|4.0|This book received glowing reviews, and it does not disappoint. This is a deep, transcendent love story. The memories of a New York, an art world, a rock'n'roll world that no longer exist - the stuff that brought you here - are great, but end up as backdrop. PS: Patti's got style...
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I am totally hooked on this website.  It's the first place I go to when i turn my kindle on.  Love it!
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I liked Temple Run 2, and decided to give this a try.  The scenery is a LOT different than 2, and took some getting used to.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the balloon ride is not as good as the Mine in 2, and I don't really like what I call the &#34;music box gamble&#34; but all in all it's a fun game.  Again, not for young children.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just so awsome and my children and i just feel in love with it once my friends tould me about it
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's just a wonderful experiance for children all ages; and it's great entertainment tool for long trips and it keeps children<br />busy.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|There is a lot of shooting/action. It is partly a true story about how organized crime tried to get into Los Angeles but was pushed out and never came back.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've enjoyed this game on my computer for years.  Now it's fun to have it in a portable version on my Kindle.

B009OYTAL8|5.0|Very well done, good characters, great actions scenes.  Just the right amount of darkness and comedy.  Great seeing John Barrowman as well. :)
0307279189|5.0|I love narrative nonfiction, and Christopher McDougall gives the reader a great experience here. It's amazing to read about El Caballo and the Tarahumara indians. If you are interested in adventure and/or barefoot running, check this one out!
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I have been a fan of Dickens ever since I was introduced to A Christmas Carol.  I am intrigued by the language and customs of England during the this period, and Dickens' work should be included in most English Life and Literature classes.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|Matrix is what humanity is real in life are going through right now.  This &#34;real world&#34; is all illusion and there are Controllers who do not have our best interests at heart who are creating this &#34;reality&#34;.  However, humanity is doing a fine job of busting them and finding their spiritual path out of this illusion created in hell by psychopaths.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It's just a wonderful reading and story learning experiance for children all ages that are eager to learn kids stories.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|I love the novel and the movie is just as wonderful.  What can you say about Robert Redford, other than he is a star in anything he is in.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|My wife and I laughed very hard at Ted.  This movie is for adults only!  Two thumbs up for the directors on Ted.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I installed this on my Kindle Fire HD and was a little disappointed in it.  The HD Fire doesn't handle the game quited as well as I think it should, but it's playable.  Would I purchase more levels or games of Slender Man?  I don't think so.
B00821OX98|3.0|Excellent cast, but story didn't really hold my attention. The show seems well made and the actors are great,  but the story didn't hold my interest beyond three episodes. Maybe I didn't give the show enough time.
B00BI745AA|5.0|We really enjoyed it would recommend this movie to anyone.  Some may find it boring if you are expecting an action movie.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I loved the Liam Neeson version of this movie and after much debate rented this movie. And I did not finish it. I agree with many who said the lead characters could not sing. I like Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman but listening to them sing for two hours was painful. I liked Anne Hathaway's Dream a Little Dream and Samantha Barks' On My Own and Do You Hear the People Sing (not on the soundtrack shame on them).<br />When I say someone help Hollywood I mean this. I am so tired of Hollywood trying to take something already done and decent and try to create something new and failing miserably. (Footloose, anyone?). Sometimes they suceed (The Dark Knight trilogy) but most of the time they fail. We need writers and producers in Tinseltown who will create new stories, not do the same thing over and over and over and over, or even worse never ending SEQUELS. Hollywood's thinking seems to be take a successful story, put a few big name actors in it and instant hit. We need to tell them not so.<br />On that note, we just need to wait a few years to see what unvisionary director does with his/her version of this story.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love everything about it the suspense, the romance, but I wish amanda could finally get her Jack at least let him know who she is and he could help them take down the Graysons.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This game works good on my Kindle Fire HD.  I would have given it 5 stars but I think it has levels that are really too difficult.  I say that because I'm stuck, so take it with a grain of salt.  The background sounds are unusual yet somewhat soothing and calming, which betrays the anxiety level produced when you work to keep from being absorbed while trying to navigate between great orbs of matter.  But it is fascinating, intriguing, compelling, and I believe worth the money.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I love this movie!  This IS the very best version of Star Trek The Motion Picture.  Cleaned up special effects, new scenes, remastered, and terrifically edited.  If you like this movie, then this is THE version of it to own.  This is also NOT the same as the blu-ray \\"Directors Cut\\", which does not have the new special effects.<br /><br />What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said.  To me, this IS what Star Trek is all about.  Some have called it boring and overly long.  Granted, it's not for everyone.  Some of the flyover scenes are bit too long at times.  It never bothered me, but some it will. If you are looking for explosions, Phaser battles, weak story and mindless dialogue, I would direct you to the J.J. Abrahms version of Star Trek.  This is a completely different animal.  Brilliant and intriguing story that will keep you guessing until the end.  It's also a total breakthrough for the Spock character.  The story ties in directly with his ongoing battles with his emotions.  Very well done.  The special effects, considered groundbreaking at the time, still hold up very well.  After all, this film was made in 1979.  The soundtrack is also groundbreaking.  The legendary Jerry Goldsmith created a magnificent score that ended up being used in Star Trek The Next Generation.<br /><br />The story seems simplistic at first.  An immense cloud, of awesome power, is headed toward Earth.  It can destroy everything in it's path.  Enterprise is the only ship that can intercept it in time.  There's a catch though.  This is a totally new and redesigned ship.  It's still under construction.  The crew has to battle a ship plagued with problems before they can take on the intruder.  James T. Kirk, now Admiral Kirk, is given temporary command of the ship for this mission.  This brings him into a direct conflict with its current captain, William Decker. Will they get the ship ready and intercept the intruder in time?  Even if they do, how can they defeat an invincible enemy like this?  You will have to watch it to find out.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Enjoyed this book, liked the characters.  Not excellent, but a very good read.  I will likely seek out other books by this author.

B0095P31L6|5.0|This is such a great movie. If you like westerns, cartoons, or comedies you'll love RANGO. My favorite line in the film is: &#34;One time I found a human spinal column in my fecal matter.&#34; Classic.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|This appeals to the tinker in me, and I find myself trying hard to remember which colors mix to make which color, and THEN I have to get the pipes all lined up so it will make the right colors at the right time!!  It's a blast!!  It's fun!!  It's frustrating!!  AARRGGGHHHH!!!  I can't remember if I purchased this (if I did, it was worth it) (I'm writing this review at work--don't tell the boss) or if it was a free download, but it is intriguing and entertaining.  May not be for younger children but it's still a great game and certainly encourages one to think!!  Just one little flaw I found:  sometimes a block will get &#34;stuck&#34; next to another one when you move it and drop it too early or a little off position.  Then you have to keep moving one or the other until you get them separated.  That's the reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  And if I could have given it another 1/2 star, I would have.

B00457WZEI|4.0|This was a great story, but I saw the movie before I read the book, so I felt like the movie was better.  That never happens, I know.  :)  The book helped clear up some questions I had after watching the movie.
B004OT2WKO|5.0|There aren't many LEGO sets that are officially licensed by automobile manufacturers, and while licensed sets do very well on the secondary market, these do exceptionally well.  This model should be no different.<br /><br />It's an iconic set of an iconic product.  Perhaps you've never heard of the Unimog, but it is well-known around the world and in military circles for being a versatile, unstoppable beast of a truck that can get in anywhere and do just about anything.  Even old beaten, stripped out 1960's Unimogs return tens of thousands of dollars on eBay.  This is also the first time a LEGO product has carried the Mercedes logo, which is large and iconic in and of itself.<br /><br />Speaking of the build, this is a very impressive kit.  It's large, with lots of pieces and lots of articulation and movement.  It's built well, in that it's not just meant to be displayed, but can actually be played with.  You'll find value in the challenge of building as well as the fun of manipulating it when you're done.  It's one of the few LEGO models I've had as much fun with as an adult after the build as I did actually building it.  Last, it makes a nice display.<br /><br />In fact, the only reason this isn't a slam dunk of a buy is that it's a Technic set with not a lot of unique pieces.  This will keep its value down over the long run, but expect it to go up in value dramatically in the first year after production ceases -- which should be some time this year.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Hey I loved this book, It's a feast so many twists along the way you never know where the characters are going to end up which is disconcerting, like the previous books but characters do continue so one must continue  to read on getting sucked into the story. There are story's that end satisfactory while others befudel us the reader. A great exotic world of fun.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I love the way this books reveals itself and plays outs. So amazing! It really catches you and doesn't let you go. Such great twist too.
B00479SVBU|4.0|First of all and most important, this FM transmitter is about the clearest I have tried...Virtually static-free. The sound volume is excellent and it plays my MP3's flawlessly. The folder hierarchy is easy to navigate to choose the music you wish to listen to although the display is bit small and truncates folder/file information. I think a &#34;scrolling&#34; display should be instilled. It will play from either SD card or USB drive or directly from an external MP3 player or CD player with a 3.5mm jack.<br /><br />There is a remote with a few more functions available than are directly available on the player...One in particular is you can only fast forward/reverse a track with the remote. This really only limits (making necessary) use with audio books where you might want to repeat a portion you may have missed.<br /><br />There are a few &#34;quirks&#34; I have encountered where saving FM frequencies is a bit cumbersome and the file/folder arrangement is by date rather than alpha-numeric. Also, the remote is not perfectly responsive even when directly/pointed in front of player...The player may not always  perform a command.<br /><br />I will say the company, Satechi, is very customer oriented since I had a few questions about my SoundFly AUX and they answered my e-mails very quickly with easy to understand information. I really feel confident with their product reliability and support. I also suggested they update their firmware with a few user-friendly controls including playlists, album and genre selections and easier folder navigation. These really are simple updates for firmware to read ID tags within files. Satechi acknowledged my suggestions and I look forward to them including these suggestions in future player models.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with my SoundFly AUX and expect to get many years of good sounding use from it. This SoundFly AUX is a very decent FM transmitter MP3 player.
B001NLL8LA|3.0|If you perservere past the first 8 or 10 chapters it becomes more interesting and more like his previous books.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|This book opened my eyes to building rapport with people and to understand the importance of removing your ego from the conversation. I would recommend it to anyone who who like to build better relationships and those who have a hard time connecting to other people.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was by hooked from season 1. I picked up season 1 after hearing others talk about the series. I then picked up seasons  2 and 3 on Prime. I rarely get hooked on a series built this was 1 that reeled me in. Six stars beyond a doubt. Do yourself a favor and start with season 1.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|The instructions aren't very clear as to what you are to do.  It works okay and I like it.  I guess the more I use it the more I'll figure it out.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This show really brings you in like your are part of the show! I love that it takes me away from reality and takes my kind off the real world.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hard to say which is the best book of the series, but this one does not disappoint.  Just wish it wasn't over....
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Couldn't stand either of the lead characters, especially him, BUT I did read the first two books -- you know how it is when you can't turn your eyes off a car wreck? Stopped reading 50 or so inches into the third book.<br /><br />Some of the reviews I read are way better than these books.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is a great twist on some of the original Sherlock Holmes stories.  By bringing the setting into the 21st century, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works are infused with current-day means of communication and research that Doyle, I believe, would have loved.
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|Poor acting, poor screenplay, poor music, poor directing, poor cinematography.  Very disappointing.  And I loved Lord of the Rings.  Don't know what book this movie was based on, as it only vaguely resembled \\"The Hobbit\\".
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This is the first book that I've read by Mr. Thiede, and based on this book, it definitely won't be the last.  The book very entertainingly chronicles the sudden murderous spree of (I can't tell you or it would ruin the mystery!), who decides that he is going to kill certain people that he feels has wasted his time.  What really spooked me was that this actually does happen in real life.  Not necessarily this specific scenario, but that there are certain people and types of people out there that can just decide that other human beings have done something to them that warrants taking their lives, even something trivial such as wasting their time.<br /><br />Hot on the trail of our killer is Detective Max Larson.  I found him to be a refreshing departure from the stereotypical hard-boiled detective character that is so often recycled over and over in book after book.  He, along with his rookie partner (veteran detective with rookie partner is always entertaining!) use the clues that they have to try and track down the offender.  The killer, like some of the more memorable ones in real like (Jack the Ripper, the Zodiac Killer) leaves taunting clues to law enforcement, written in his victims blood.  The clues let the Detective and his partner know why he was killing people, but it doesn't shed any light on why that would be an offense punishable by death.<br /><br />The killer in this story is nicely crafted, and his descent into murder and madness is well described.  I always enjoy trying to get into the head of such monsters, and Mr. Thiede does a good job of that.  I also like how even though Detective Larson is initially hesitant of his rookie partner, the investigation brings them closer together and ultimately prove to be an effective duo.<br /><br />This book was a quick read for me, and that's just how I like it.  Imagine a one hour crime procedural TV show such as Bones, Cold Case, Criminal Minds, etc. and then imagine an episode being put into book form - that's exactly what Time Killer is, and that is definitely a good thing!  The author does a great job at building suspense - in my opinion, the most important part of any murder mystery.  The book is very descriptive in its portrayals of the violence and goriness of the wake left by a serial psychopathic killer, but does not go over the top.  And while some other reviewers seemed to have not been satisfied with the ending, it left me ready for the next Detective Larson book, and hopefully many more to follow after that.<br /><br />This book is a steal at $1.99 for the Kindle edition, and is definitely worth it.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is a great feature packed bluray. It is a great movie. Completely recommend it. It is phenomenal. The commentary by Sam Mendes is amazing.

B00B7FXZQS|2.0|Lot more dragged out then last movie, not very suspenseful.  Lots of little &#34;shock&#34;, &#34;jump&#34; camera  moments, but not very scary at all. Ending was the best part, why couldn't that be thrown throughout the movie. Damn shame, hopefully the last in the series.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Good puzzles, great graphics, kept my interest. Different than the usual hidden object games I like to play. Would buy this type of game again.
1884822312|4.0|I had always heard really good thing about this book, so i decided to get it.  Let me start with the book is BIG! but is also well made, with good solid binding.  Once you get past the intro there is no verbiage.  It is page after page of diagrams (4 to a page)  Nice and big with each section labeled &#34;Mate in 1&#34; &#34;Mate in 2&#34; Mate in 3&#34; etc.<br />I know what you are thinking...I'm a USCF C player (or better) why would i waste my time and money on a book with mate in 1's???  Oh don't be so misguided fellow chess player.  It is always good practice going over things we all think we know.  And i think you will be surprised at how much you don't know :-)<br />Even the mate in 2's can be a real challenge, but the reward is well worth it.  This book is excellent for visual training, and pattern recognition.  If it good enough for the Polgar sisters, its good enough for me.  I have stared at some of these mate in 2's for 30+ minutes before finding the correct line, but what a rewarding/learning experience!<br />Lazlo Polgar knows his stuff!  I would highly recommend this book for all levels.<br />I give it 4 stars only because some will find the lack of verbiage, and the answers being only 1 move long not to there liking.  Life is not always easy, neither is this book...Enjoy!
B0083VIWSA|4.0|I could give this album 5 stars if the title track were the only song on the album. &#34;Maggot Brain&#34; is a beautiful psychedelic experience. The 11 minutes of guitar work are absolutely hypnotic. Tracks 2-6 are excellent as well. A few of them are kind of Sly and the Family Stone'ish. Very groovy, with really excellent musicianship and lyrics. &#34;Wars of Armageddon&#34;, on the other hand, is kind of like, but is actually a lot better than, &#34;Revolution #9&#34; from the White Album. Long and a little bit annoying. Too long. Too psychedelic. But overall, the album is great. Got a few nice bonus tracks, including a different version of &#34;Maggot Brain&#34;.<br /><br />If you dig funk/rock you'll dig this album.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great show that is highly addictive!!  We really enjoy this show and always look forward to each episode.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Awesome graphics, awesome fun, and an awesome game. Good RPG elements and fun multiplayer. Much better than the third dungeon hunter. I haven't played it a whole lot yet but from what I have played it is a fun and good looking game and I plan to keep playing it.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|This Tarantino flic reminds me of Pulp Fiction - on the one hand it is a comedy, but the subject matter is very dark and troubling - did some of these things really happen???  Too much gratuitous violence for me.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I really like this game a lot I am kicking but<br />and I am not getting killed at all<br />so u should realty play this game it is fun and awsome
B002VHI8FE|4.0|I enjoyed it. Not perfectly written, but what is. Excited to start next book. Here's hoping the next one is as good or better.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|It took a few minutes to understand what to do, but once I did, I was off like a race horse.  The best thing this game offers (that I haven't found in other games) is that at pivotal points, it takes notes for you.  This helps you when you need to crack the codes to get in different doors (especially in the second and third levels).  I enjoyed the second level the best.  This game lasted about 2 hours or so. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because some codes repeat in the exact same order on level 3 as they did in level 2. I would have liked different codes.
B002YMWPUA|4.0|Hunger (Steve McQueen, 2008)<br /><br />Even if Hunger were a ten-minute short--nothing but the central scene where Bobby Sands (Prometheus' Michael Fassbender) is outlining the plan for the hunger strike, and then defending that plan, to Dominic Moran (The Wind that Shakes the Barley's Liam Cunningham), it would be a brilliant piece of filmmaking. Steve McQueen (Twelve Years a Slave)'s directorial debut, an examination of the 1981 hunger strike that changed the face of Belfast-IRA relations, is a powerful piece of work indeed, and much of that is down to Fassbender.<br /><br />The plot, for those not up on your recent history: in the early eighties, Northern Ireland removed Special Category status from IRA prisoners, classifying them as common criminals rather than prisoners of war. (Special Category status had been granted in 1972, as part of the same negotiations that led to the release of folk hero Gerry Adams.) This led to a string of increasingly extreme protests, with the hunger strike organized by Sands being the last, and most extreme, of the lot, lasting seven months and resulting in the deaths of ten men before being called off. As I mentioned in the first paragraph, the second half of the film deals with the hunger strike; the first half sets the scene, showing graphically what life was like for the prisoners once Special Category status had been revoked, as well as the effects of some of the ongiong protests (the blanket protest and the dirty protest are specifically mentioned in the title cards; give wikipedia a look for information if the film doesn't give you enough).<br /><br />McQueen is a vastly talented director, and there is a lot of credit to be given to the ability to take what is essentially the story of seventy-five men sitting around doing nothing for seven months and making it into a film as tense as it is. But the real hero of the tale of the making of this film is Irish playwright Enda Walsh (Disco Pigs), who penned that pivotal central scene, as well as the rest of the dialogue here. That's just as important as McQueen's arresting steadicam shots (who knew a janitor sweeping a wet hallway could be so riveting?), and with actors of the caliber of Fassbender to deliver that dialogue, there's really no way this movie could be a loser. But I didn't expect it to be quite as brilliant as it is, and that's something. ****scene, as well as the rest of the dialogue here. That's just as important as McQueen's arresting steadicam shots (who knew a janitor sweeping a wet hallway could be so riveting?), and with actors of the caliber of Fassbender to deliver that dialogue, there's really no way this movie could be a loser.

B00000260F|2.0|for what it's worth, this jb album should have been a 3 song 12\\" ep. \\"people get ready\\" and the 2 instrumentals, \\"escape\\" and \\"you know we know\\". the rest of this album is loaded with vapid songs that are so completely buried in awful mega-overproduced 80's digital madonna grease, it's truly unbearable. jb didn't compose any of these songs -(thank god!), and it's still amazing till this day how he agreed to record and release this poop. definitely for jb completists only.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|What drew me to this movie was the interesting cast. Love 'em all. The story was a bit lame with Clint Eastwood playing yet, another crotchety old man with a secret. I couldn't help think Jenna Fisher, from the Office, every time  Amy had any lengthy dialogue. What's not to like about Justin Timberlake? I really hope he doesn't get pigeon holed as a good old boy in future films.<br /><br />All in all, the cast did well with this so-so piece.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series! Everyone is so believable, it just seems real. I gave it 5 stars because I WANT to watch the next show ASAP! Have to have my fix of Abbey!
B00BCV3HGU|1.0|A number of tracks are stolen from other EDM artists with out their consent. Most notably are two tracks from Arty & Mat Zo of Anjunabeats label. I don't know how you can give any stars to an album that has stolen music.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />enough said.

B004SCN2F6|5.0|I am going to start this off by saying that I love this game and the devs.<br /><br />If you are having any trouble with the game in any way visit the forums, there are many very skilled players there who are happy to help.<br /><br />Game play is challenging and rewarding. Higher difficulties are exactly that. You have to pay attention to EVERYTHING to have a chance of surviving on even the intermediate difficulties.<br /><br />The only two downsides are that certain menus are somewhat buried (faction conflicts specifically) and the learning curve is steep.<br /><br />Also it is difficult to find the time to play the game, you don't want to play for just 5 or 10 minutes. You if you at all enjoy turn based strategy or 4X games you will want to sink hours into this game in a heartbeat.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Good app does all the things i hope a downloading app would do and more with other features on it to personal item all my work.
1478219181|5.0|Ok, I never get tired of rereading Pride and Prejudice.  I chose this 200th Anniversary edition because of its beautiful cover art with the tulips and thorns [[ASIN:1478219181 Pride and Prejudice]]- it is nice to have a change from the same old tired covers.  It was an additional pleasure to see that my replacement copy came in done so well.  Nice paper, perfectly sized format and font.  This is a good edition to choose for those  of us who still like to have  books in our library.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|One of the most uplifting tales I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Rodriquez is a national treasure. Very worthy of your time.
B00932A4XE|4.0|I expected more from this film, but it is fun. Elizabeth Banks is as usual hysterical. Chris Rock hysterical. Teen appropriate, but more fun the young adult.
0812975219|1.0|I've twice tried to read this book--and have given up for a second time.  The author has some interesting, although suspect, ideas--but his unbearable arrogance makes it impossible to concentrate on them.  Furthermore, much of his own theories presented in this book are disproved by these same theories!  But even more than this, his arrogance is intolerable--but I've already said that, haven't I...<br /><br />If I could give this book and its author zero stars, I would.  (But of course, the author would love my rejection of him and his book.  After all, he brags how he loves \\"the idiots\\" who disagree with him, since those are the people he needs to make his methods work.)  I can't believe this book has received ANY positive reviews.
0739321617|4.0|[[ASIN:B006G85FBO The Google Story: For Google's 10th Birthday]]Reading the Google Story was a pleasure. It started out with describing the intimidating pedigrees of both Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Then it went on to describe the audacious actions the two co-founders maneuvered time after time, cutting deals while using their intuition and judgment. Finally, I came to find the book inspiring.

B00BSBT8M6|2.0|I'll probably get bashed for leaving this review by those who have read the book and who have a better understanding of the hidden meaning(s) in this movie. But I don't think a person's understanding of a film should be contingent on reading and completely grasping the novel prior.<br /><br />The special effects were dazzling in and of themselves but they were distracting to the overall story line. Jellyfish don't fluoresce to the point of creating a \\"glow stick\\" effect making everything visible in the middle of the night in the middle of the ocean. Meerkats don't live on some \\"bionic island\\" in the Pacific nor do they sleep in trees. They burrow in the ground and live in Africa. So many times the water was way too calm and it was obvious they were filming (several) segments in a pool and it was obviously synthetic.<br /><br />From other people's reviews it seems that the second story that involved real people was what really happened. But what felt so deflated was how so much attention and detail were devoted to the fantasy of story #1 that when the second story was told in a mere forty seconds - I felt so ripped off. Maybe a brief visual or some flashbacks capturing the violent/turbulent time with the human survivors might have made it more salvageable. It came off as poorly executed and something quickly tossed into the movie.<br /><br />For me this movie didn't make me ponder or embrace a higher power. This is what we're supposed to think simply because he survived a ship wreck? God spared him? What about the people in the supposed second story (what really happened) who didn't survive like his mother and the cook and sailor? If the story were told from their point of view we'd have a very depressing movie pondering that there is no god at all. Instead we are fed a sugar-coated, extravagant lie and now we're supposed to feel all warm and fuzzy inside. So much detail paid to fantasy and the animation and not nearly enough to details and to conveying a consistentand infallible message. Oh and that last scene with the Tiger slowly walking into the jungle as if to say, \\"See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya.\\" left me totally flat. I expected too much, I guess.
0440238609|3.0|I enjoyed the novels, but I had a few problems.<br /><br />1. The main character was not likable at all. I liked her daemon and the boy she was with AND the scientist far better then the main protagonist.<br /><br />2. Alot of plot items are never explained, or are random. This annoyed me a lot. I was reading through these books expecting a resolution for them and no resolution came.<br /><br />3. Some characters get completely and utterly abandoned, and then are swept up at the end. The scientist is a huge example. She was very interesting, but besides chill out with some AE aliens, she was stuck there to do nothing important beyond say the protagonist and their BF should go shag and fix the universe again. All that setup, just for that. Jeez.<br /><br />With all that said, some of the other characters and events that did have proper explanations were great. The polar bears and their society were awesome, the daemon concept and the afterlife were neat, as well as the witches. So there are some great aspects that make the series worth reading, but be prepared for important things to never be explained. [Did 'god' die and no one noticed or cared? What was that even?????????? if you have read it you know what i mean.]<br /><br />As a side note: This series isn't offensive to religion unless you are some sort of fundamentalist or extremist. I'm guessing the backlash is only due to the catholic church in the protagonist's world are considered 'evil' and woah dang cant have catholics be portrayed as evil now can we.<br /><br />The series itself left me both in awe and disappointment, and has a sense of being 'unfinished'. Still worth it though. Its all packed in this nice little boxed set though so id suggest getting all three like this.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|real life - awesome story.  the twists were great, it was so fun to see the characters over come the challenge.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is great it is easy to play and you don't have to spend any money to get upgrades you just race and can get them.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is great!  We had DS's for years and now have upgraded to Kindle Fire.  They loved this game on the DS and can now have all that fun again and for only 99 cents...that's great bargain! Thanks!
0439023521|4.0|Don't avoid this series just because of the hype. Its still worth reading, especially if you like dystopian worlds or liked Battle Royale. The emphasis on outfits, looks and dressing up is a little on the excessive side, and the protagonist isn't exactly a likable character. But if you can get past those things, this is a great novel. Probably the best of the series.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the game is similar as temple run 2 but it is farway better than templerun 2.I just loved the game.
B0058W74UY|5.0|My music plays in this file.  I love it. Sounds great.  Easy download.  Recommend it to everyone.  Thanks so much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game. It is really awesome and I like the fact that every once on awhile they change the place. For instance when I started playing we were in new York and then it took us to Brazil and then to Sydney and now we are in Tokyo. However my only problem is that sometimes it will glitch but other than that I have no problem with it.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Boy howdy, 2012 was a great year for movies. And this is one of the best of that fine crop, if perhaps the hardest to watch for anyone who's ever had to deal with these issues in their family and/or with friends. The first twenty minutes had me cringing in shared pain with Cooper's character, and I didn't know if I could take too much more. But then Russell evens out the plane and takes us on a gorgeous and touching ride through the clouds of sanity, and thereabouts.<br /><br />Cooper is so good it's kind of scary at points, and as good as Lawrence is it's Cooper's film. He holds his own with DeNiro, and Bob is as good as he's been in years, so that's a high bar. All the minor roles are done to perfection, and Russell keeps things moving towards a conclusion that could feel sappy but actually plays out quite well, if a little predictably Hollywoodish.<br /><br />Unsettling in many good ways, Silver Linings Playbook will go down as a classic not only for tackling a usually taboo subject, but for doing so in an oddly good-humored fashion that both delights and occasionally horrifies. And for anyone who's ever placed a crazy sports bet on a whim, the line after \\"I believe in you\\" will be one of the funniest things you'll ever hear.<br /><br />Point taken: none of us is really entirely sane.
B00C32R64G|3.0|I was drawn in initially by \\"Hangman's Body Count.\\" I got distracted by the sound of actual metal on the radio again. What I found though is a pop rock album with 3 rad metal songs inserted into it. \\"hangman's Body Count\\" , \\"Black Bart\\", and \\"Room 24\\" (which features horror metal legend King Diamond) are all really really fantastic metal tracks, and are truly worth buying. The rest of the album though is bouncy and light. Considering that, its kinda funny the legit hard stuff is what's getting radio play. In summary, download those 3 songs, and leave the weak sauce daytime music festival tracks alone.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is AMAZING!  Every year it gets better.  With the addition of the 2 girls it has just made it funnier.  Wish they would find someone for Raj though.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|From the first season through the eighth each season proved to be better than the next. I very much enjoyed the producer's use of their creative license. Although not entirely for the faint of heart, this series was very entertaining. If I could submit a loose quote: ...There are more things in heaven and earth Horacio than any of us can think of...<br />Mesa AZ JPG
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Ho hey is the most popular song on the album but the rest of the album is just as good. Hopefully they will produce similar quality work in the future. A new rising star of a band, can't wait to see what the future holds for them.

B00968THRE|5.0|So good, even better than album &#34;Lights&#34; which was great. So many levels of sound, very deep, so perfect.<br />What a lovely lady
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I shed tears evading this book. We, civilians, should thank God every night for those who defend our &#34;freedom&#34;.  And...thank those who pay the ultimate price.  Amen.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would suggest the reading the book first before watching the movie because you will understand the little background story when you watch the movie. It's an easy book book to read and it doesn't take long to finish.
B004Q3SGWG|4.0|Wonderful and brave film; Franco does an incredible job in this one man film!<br />I always love Franco's work. He's an incredible actor with a really fine mind.
B007OY5V86|4.0|I am glad to now own this blu-ray. I just wish all blu-rays were &#34;all regions.&#34; As long as I am wishing, I wish all blu-rays had English subtitles (; but probably all language groups wish this!).
B003J5UIRS|5.0|Having been introduced to the topic of past life research through the writings of Walter Semkiw, M.D. who first introduced me to the original research on the topic of past life recollections in young children conducted by Ian Stevenson, M.D. at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, I find this work by Jim Tucker, M.D. to be highly \\"consilientive\\" (see p. 195) in bringing together facts and theories from many perspectives to link and form a common foundation of knowledge and important questions on the topic of reincarnation. Dr. Tucker's research builds on the pioneering work of Dr. Stevenson (and others) from the 1960's and into the 21st century.<br /><br />Beyond the traditional boundaries and limitations of many religious doctrines, Dr. Tucker examines facts as they are found and presented. In Socratic fashion, Dr. Tucker asks important questions and provides answers to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas. The book stays within the research boundaries of examining childhood recollections, whereas Dr. Semkiw's inquiries and presentations delve into speculative possible adult cases of past life connections (see [...]<br /><br />A book which provides a good, supporting, in-depth case study is [[ASIN:0446509345 Soul Survivor: The Reincarnation of a World War II Fighter Pilot]] by Bruce and Andrea Leininger with Ken Gross. Reading these books together brings the discussion beyond taboo into a present, scientifically studied research topic.<br /><br />I found the book most interesting in its logical, and well presented topical organization of facts correlated with scientific research in medicine, physics and cultural traditions.
0374105235|4.0|Willow Mclane<br />Per. 7<br />5/1/13<br /><br />Violence is ravaging all over, leaving terrible and horrendous results in Sierra Leone. Ishmael Beah is eventually thrown into this turmoil like many others. A gentle twelve year old school boy is forced to flee or lose his life at the hands of rebel forces.<br /><br />It's either keep running or face \\"killers\\" in his young eyes. However, Ishmael wasn't able to run fast enough to escape the clutches of participating in the war that was tearing the country apart at the seams. He gives the shocking account of an innocent beginning to which nearly all hope and joy had been stripped away until there were not nearly any reachable remnants.<br /><br />A Long Way Gone was an eye opening story and written experience. It was raw. Raw enough to get the hearting pumping out of its comfort zone, but not even then half of Ishmael's during his experience. The simplicity in some of the details was not deep or sugarcoated and was written very straightforward. I really felt empathy for nearly every page of the book, due to the gruesome ordeals he had to bear through with.<br /><br />The honesty. Ishmael's portrayal of the events he committed and witnessed before even adulthood was heartbreaking; it really pulled many heartstrings. Truths spoken of are strong enough to be an anchor that holds the reader over to read another page and then another. Ishmael's story is stirring and compelling. A connection is easily palpable, if it's whether he's scared and alone or having a touching moment by just dancing to his precious simple rap cassettes.<br /><br />The author, Ishmael Beah, himself is already respectable for living through his chronicle, but even more striking for creating an impact with this propounding memoir. I feel that he was trying to present the message and lesson of even a child is capable of doing terrible things. The intense need to survive will change a person; nothing else is as important. A theme that is deeply rooted inthis thrilling is the act of revenge will become a never ending cycle or simply a double edged blade if acted upon. This was a tale or survival.<br /> \\"When I was a child, my grandmother told me that the sky speaks to those who look and listen to it. She said, `In the sky there are always answers and explanations for everything: every pain, every suffering, joy, and confusion.' That night I wanted the sky to talk to me.\\"
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of all the original Beatles studio recordings!  It is like listening to them for the first time, every time.
B00BIR381W|5.0|I absolutely love this show! I was bored one day so I decided to look on amazon for tv shows to buy & I came across this one. I read about it & it sounded like something I would really enjoy watching so I took a chance. I don't have cable/satellite so I can't watch it when it airs on tv. After watching the first season I was hooked! So I bought another season & I can't wait to buy the 3rd season when it comes out! I can't wait to see what happens! I hope this show lasts for many more seasons because it is one of my favorites.
B0020M99LC|4.0|Definitely a guy flick, but you chicks will find it pretty cool.  Lots of action and plenty of style.  I enjoyed it very much.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|a little more complicated than the 1st season but definitely pretty good! I would highly suggest everyone to watch this!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|It's a Johnny Depp movie!  I love to just watch him act!  He is amazing!  He is very talented.  Love him.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Great family movie if a little sad at times.  True story which adds to the enjoyment!  My young grandaughters loved it!
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|I liked this movie, it had an interesting plot, and I think Liam Neeson is such a good actor.  It will keep you guessing.
0823023494|5.0|This book helped me design some of the characters for my upcoming book series. I'm so glad I decided to buy it.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I did not buy my G13 through Amazon. I got it for my work. I am an AutoCAD designer. The flexibility of this item is great. I have used the G13 for creating shortcuts in AutoCAD and Navisworks. Now I can do 10 command at the press of a button. I like that it isn't designed so that you can only input your commands one way. The software allows you to input through \\"Keystroke\\", \\"Multikey\\", Textblock, \\"Mouse Function\\" and \\"Hotkeys\\". You can also set it up to play your media and open your computer desktop shortcuts. Like I said it is very flexible. I rate this very high, for several reasons. One it is not just for one thing gaming, almost any program can be setup to be used by this little gem. Two the fact that I have had it for 3+ years of regular use and not any mechanical or software problems. I have traversed from Windows XP to Windows 7 seamlessly. The profiles transferred very easily. All in all a great buy!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Far and away my favorite show, Elementary is far better than the average TV fare.  Clever, funny, thoughtful, smart.  The basic premise is a modern NYC-based take on the Arthur Canon Doyle formula.  The interplay between Sherlock Holmes (Jonny Miller) and Dr. Joan Watson (Lucy Liu) crackles with intelligence.  The characters, each with complex backstories and secrets, are far more than your standard detective stereotypes.  The writing is marvelous.  The plots are varied and clever serving as stage to the evolving relationship between Holmes and Watson. I like and care for the characters.  Every episode is a treat, to be relished.  A tremendous success, thankfully renewed for a second season.
B000255LIY|5.0|This is another one of my favorite movies.  Glenn Close plays Eleanore of the Aquitane and has a back-biting relationship with her husband the whole of the time.  She's exuberates strength.  The family is what we would call today DISFUNCTIONAL!!!
0385736002|5.0|Within just a few paragraphs it had me sucked in. I'm not going to nit pick whether or not Orjai had any civil war burial grounds or not because i have no idea..the scene he paints in the fights are so vivid and intense(to me) that I cant wait to complete the series.. Yes its a \\"Teen fiction\\" but I think that some teen fiction is better than adult..plus im only in my mid 20's :)<br />If you liked the Loren Legacies you will really enjoy this as well..it really reminds me of it
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and I'm glad I read it.  The book is an easy read that keeps you interested in finding out what happens next.  The characters are well thought out and easy to connect with.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|endless ways to solve an aventure. you can use your imagination to come up with the most wacky way to solve a puzzle.
B007MJT1K2|5.0|The story is typical Tintin with a lot of action in many international locations, the look of the film is great, and it was well voiced.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I loved this season of Dr Who! Katherine Tate did a marvelous job as Donna Noble and I think David Tennant did a superb job as The Doctor. The last episode almost brought tears to my eyes.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Have watched season 2 twice. I have difficulty deciding which is my second favorite character...Maggie Smith being my favorite. I could list them all, but you know the characters. And the characters we aren't supposed to like (Thomas, O'Brien, etc.) I detest, as it is intended.<br />Oh well, I'll list my choices for 2nd favorite:<br />Bates<br />Anna<br />Mary<br />Cora<br />Robert<br /><br />After watching several episodes I find myself talking like a British Aristocrat:)
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Great game and really enjoying playing.  Thanks to the designers.  And my grandsons love to play also.  I play a few of the games by the same designers.  Again thanks.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|This film was much more entertaining that I thought.  The story took twists and turns that kept the story interesting.  McConaughey's was quite interesting as the wheeling, dealing attorney who gets some business that gets him in trouble.  Good show.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Great board, but windows 8 oem will not install with revision A bios.  You must install updated bios before win 8 setup will run properly
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love the movie, almost as much as the stage play  - Hugh Jackman does a great job as Jean ValJean
B008Y73940|5.0|This is an excellent lawyer movie.  Of course, it's more than slightly unrelealistic to believe that a lawyer can spend the entire portion of the day that he is not in the courtroom, seemingly every day, driving around in a chauffeured limo.  There are such things as legal research, legal writing, computers, computer printers, copiers, legal files storage and access, document preparation, etc. that require a physical office for a lawyer.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Very useful and works amazing. I use it on all my devices. It's easy to set up and it's very stable
B0000VCZK2|4.0|I was generally pleased with this product. There were alot of extras, but in my opinion the different versions IE directors cut etc were simply repetitious and did not add all that much to the experience. But even the director thought it was not worth it! Liked this product and still glad I bought it.
B007SPN5MA|3.0|I started listening to Glen Hansard after seeing &#34;Once&#34; on Broadway. His new CD doesn't disappoint, he is still searching & singing. Stays true to himself and previous music.
0060531053|4.0|First time beer makers this book is a good place to start! Gives you all the information you need on equipment and ingredients.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love being able to access my favorite radio stations on the internet, I would totally recommend this app to anyone who still appreciates live radio.
B00486070K|5.0|I connect it and it works just at the moment.<br />It was some kind of magic for me because I've tried two \\"compatible with Mac\\" items. This \\"compatible\\" items don't work after all my attempts with many drivers for them.<br />This one is more expensive but in fact that's cheaper than buying cheap items that do not work or may be need a lot of work to find a right driver.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|You're gonna love it. It's sad, buy it makes you realize that even though sometimes really messed up things happen, there's always a silver lining.
B005EHQGTS|1.0|The app I paid for only crashes and the free one works.<br />Neither do what I wanted.  I wanted to make an extended display not a mirror.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|An immersive step back in time to the intrigues and class conflicts of World War One British life. Well acted and very enjoyable
B00821PCJS|4.0|Don't know how I missed this. But it was great to watch 2 seasons.  Looking forward to the next season. I have had Amazon Prime for 2 years and never used the streaming service. Good value.
B001I189MQ|5.0|For the first time in a blockbuster superhero move, Ledger's Joker gets it right. His supervillain is anything buy arch and manages be grotesque and concrete, disturbing and entertaining.  What a lost talent!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This ebook is absolutely essential reading for you if you're considering publishing an ebook on KDP. The book is concise and really moves you closer to selling your book without getting all wound up about formatting issues. The book saved me hours of frustration and I found it quite by accident. I highly recommend reading it and keeping it as a reference as you write and step through the self publishing process.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Had this on my desktop.  Spent many late hours playing it. Was glad to find it for free for my kindle. Don't understand the fuss about ads on some games. Come on people, grow up!! Is it really that annoying? Stop whining & find something else to do if it bugs you that much!
B00BVYU2P2|5.0|Hilarious show, well written and worth the time.  Wish is was still on demand via amazon prime.  Very similar to Arrested Development in my opinion.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Considering this is rated R I was surprised at how clean it was appart from violence.  The violence that was in it was not overkill, no pun intended.  It was a great date night movie.
B005COO1X6|5.0|KING ROCKS! This story was awesome, I really enjoyed it. I just wish it was longer but then it wouldn't be a short story. They'll probably make a movie of it.lol
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I have had The 20/20 Experience for a month or so now, and I can not get enough of it.  Every time I listen to it, I like it more.  Also, every time I listen, I have a different favorite song.  It is just a GREAT CD!!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I will listen to anything Michael sings, he is a one of a kind entertainer, and a true Crooner in this day and age, so refreshing

B005UDD1R6|5.0|reputable media player for the Kindle Fire and stumbled across this one. Great app on a little machine, found all video, photo and audio files for me to decide what I wanted to do next. Tapped &#34;Play&#34; and it scrolled through my photos just loaded on the K-Fire
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I bought the CD, because I liked 1 of the songs that I heard on the radio.  This CD was a great surprise!  I really like it!
B0063M22QO|5.0|For anyone that has just started playing Mahjong this is the perfect start to a great game. Enjoy! Have fun!
B008K8X0IS|5.0|With this set. You get digital, blu-ray and DVD. The show is great. I send my DVD to my friends so they get to watch it. They just now getting into it. There a ton of extra stuff. I hadn't even watch all if it.
B001MTENOC|5.0|i tremenendously enjoyed this book! certainly not a light read, but for those seeking insight tbe book is a true peatl....
B005PK57IK|5.0|The plot is interesting and love how the characters interface with each other.  Cannot wait to get season 4 on Amazon Prime.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This DVD was delivered quickly & I am enjoying it a lot!  I don't have any idea what the lyrics are saying, but I don't care!  Romantic!

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I got this on my kindle for my 3 yr old granddaughter to play when she comes to visit.  She loves it and can play all by herself.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|I use this movie to teach irony, archetypes and literary license to interpret a story alongside of the graphic novel version of The Odyssey.
B00881PTRC|1.0|I did not like the graphics as the hangman was being &#34;hung&#34;.  I had close family member complete suicide and it brought back vivid memories!!
B008O69SZ0|4.0|Ian latest.  For me it took a few listenings to get used to, but a must for Ian fans everywhere

B005K17RU0|5.0|No problems with this app. Love the way it shows on my phone and I can have more than one location. Droid Maxx HD.
0920668372|5.0|I had bought it to read to MY kids 45 yrs ago. They loved it then!  My daughter recently had her first child and I bought a copy for her to read to her child!
B008602KQI|5.0|Good, great, horrifying.  Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job portraying Katniss.  Everyone's character was credible, the emotions flowing from them was perfect.  It doesn't make you tear up but it does keep you at the edge of your seat.  I was amused for the duration of the entire movie.  I loved the slow brewing romance between Katniss and Peeta.  I look forward to sequel.

B00821OX98|5.0|My husband and I couldn't find any thing to watch on tv so we thought why not try using my prime account and see what could find. We both decided on this one and was a great choice, have already started on season two. If decide to watch enjoy, is not for younger children.
B000NVT0RU|5.0|not a history buff, but watching this movie, if true, says a lot about certain countries and not having the honorability of keeping promises to the people who liberated them and their backing up of American troops during the German take over. SAY if TRUE.
B004HYXW1O|5.0|These guys rock! Their music is vibrant, lyrics are excellent, vocals superb...  Just a class act...  One of the best new groups of the decade.
145210655X|5.0|The kids loved it, and read it over again from time to time. Worth one read even for adults. Artwork is nice.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I really liked this movie. There was so many levels of emotion that it struck a cord within me. Helen Hunt did an awesome job acting. I am not sure I could have pulled off the nude parts. I saw the behind the scenes making of the movie and was surprised at what lengths the actors went through to authenticate their roles.
B009R659L8|4.0|Keep the answers all questions until the end of the book....Keep the romance out and answers a surprise. Would have liked a climatic ending to the capture of the criminals but all in all a good mystery.
B001J9AQA0|5.0|These guys rock! Their music is vibrant, lyrics are excellent, vocals superb...  Just a class act...  One of the best new groups of the decade.  And this first album is just perfect.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I'm hooked on breaking bad and have been patiently waiting for the last of season 8 to start in August. To fill the void I looked for something similar to keep me from getting the dt's. I remebered seeing a couple episodes of the shield way back when and decided to try it on for size. MAN! if you like breaking bad you'll love this.It's another breaking bad, but with a hell of a lot more action.I'm seriously thinking about getting the whole dvd set to go along with my breaking bad set. It really is that addictive. ( just like crystal meth.)
B0019M06JS|4.0|If you are looking for an album to highlight Elias's piano virtuosity this may not be the album for you.  I think I prefer her work in small ensembles.  My mistake.  I bought this album before I heard much of her work.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love this.  This was my first Doctor Who.  I watch this over and over.  Doctor Who, I would recommend this to my friends
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|very entertaining.  good graphics.  levels become more challenging throughout the game.  would definitely recommend. this game.  fun for all ages.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I am sorry to say that Lincoln not load.  Amazon charged me twice for the same movie in the same time frame to view.  I could not find any customer service for a 1 movie refund.  You wanted a review and you have it.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I'm not really sure what to say other than this was well worth the dollar I spent on it. Really enjoyed it and I have recommended it to many friends.
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|I thought this game it'll be more entertainment, like those games where you go from one level to the next automatically, but no, if you win one game you have to go back to the main menu every time to play another game and choose another board. For the first couple of games was ok, but then I got bored
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|With the top headliners in this film I went in thinking I was going to see a good movie....then I remembered, oh yeah this is a Quentin Tarantino movie. Be prepared for plenty of blood and guts and flying gore in slow motion throughout the film. Also the directors and writers attempt at humor during the film fails horribly. The subject matter, although attempted to be portrayed in a enlightening manner, does not succeed. Jamie Foxx does as good a job as<br />possible. The actor that portrays the bonty hunter does the best job...Leo D fails miserably.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|What a great series!  The writer got me involved with the characters and story.  Didn't want to stop reading!  I gave the set to a friend who is laid up from a serious accident. She has gotten into them and can't put them down.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love the game. You get your money's worth for sure. Story and graphics are top notch. At the $2.99 price it's a steal. It has a great mix of hidden object and puzzles to keep anyone interested.
0142410322|2.0|I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews of this book. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a true classic of children's literature, but this sequel is a rare misfire from the great Roald Dahl. It is not nearly as amusing or well conceived as the original.<br /><br />Reading this, I got the sense that Dahl's publishers must have pressured him into writing a sequel. How else to explain the lack of a narrative or thematic center? It reads more like a \\"what if?\\" story than a true sequel. I have a hard time recommending it to anyone who loved the first book.
B008FYZIVY|2.0|I ordered this as a gift for my wife. I had no interest in this or anything like it -- boring!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed the whole series and couldn't wait to get to the end to see how all the characters finally resolved their situation.  Great read!
0691152640|5.0|For educators this book will do great service both for the data and the narrative.  We can only hope that our students will remember the cautionary lessons before they repeat the title's words.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My friend first introduced me to this app and I loved playing it on her iPhone so I looked it up on my kindle and I love it!!!! It's a must get app for any age.
B000068OCS|5.0|The movie was just as I remembered it when it first came out -- very provoking. It's a keeper, and better than the sequels.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love it. Each episode takes a twist. Each person more deceitful than the next. Somehow good is trying to win in the wrong way. No raunchy sex scenes so it leaves what romance there is to the imagination, great idea. Somehow it is clean wickedness. I can't wait to see what happens and I hope this show stays on the air.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game, I've played it for several years. Come try it, I think you,'ll love it too. lots of tiles, different levels, come on challenge me.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is so cool.<br />You get to race a clock and you can get more clocks or Time if you are fast:p I totally recommend this game.....it's great:ppp
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Really enjoyed this love story. Thought that Holder was just Devine wish there were actually men like him around in that age group!!!  So beautifully written and the characters so well developed. Highly recommend.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My grandson has been asking my son for this movie for some time but he refused to pay 20.00 for it so I purchased for under 10 bucks and the quality is fantastic.
1476735115|5.0|I can definitely see Ridley Scott turning this into a blockbuster sci-fi movie. Read the hype and agree with it 100%. Engaging story and very well written.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book has been wonderful. I've learned a lot. I love this book! ! ! <)<br />I can't wait to read the next book.
055358202X|5.0|Great series! Now please Mr Martin, finish writing the rest!! Avidly awaiting the rest of the books in this series.
B004LP10PO|5.0|The blu ray edition is nothing special, I can't tell any difference between the blu and my dvd edition.  I just wanted to convert from dvd to blu.
098555780X|5.0|My son has learned to make paracord many different braclets using this book. Before we got this he knew how to make 1 design.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Looked great - a great cast, wonderful photography, sets and costumes - just didn't have a strong enough script to make it entertaining.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I read this book to preview it for a book club. At first I didn't like Harold but eventually he began to fascinate me -- so give it some time. It offers a LOT to discuss with a friend, or to think about on your own. It demonstrates how a tragedy can cause a couple to fall into a bad habit and waste years of their lives but then turn things around.  I really learned a lot from this book, but if you've lost a child it could upset you -- or enlighten you. For this reason I'm not recommending it to my book club.
0060558121|5.0|I couldn't put this book down from the second I opened it. I love it, my friends love it, it's a great read that you can truly savor.
B0063IH60K|5.0|downloaded this and android and surley is a good game to have around. It is small but what do you expect on a 7&#34; screen?
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|What a bittersweet joy to finally come to the end of the Wheel of Time tale.  14 books ... Simply fabulous.  I do believe that I'll read 'em all again someday.

B009E9QOEO|5.0|They were excellent.. Good quality and good picture. Easy to listen to and I really liked them and so did my friends.
B009186JYI|5.0|This documentary bumps Don't Look Back down a notch, Charlie Is My Darling has the best looking rock concert footage of the era that precedes Monterey Pop.<br />The interviews with Stones members are refreshingly unaffected,  Jagger in particular comes across as insightful and self aware during his interviews in this context, something he hasn't managed since.  Even the notoriously taciturn Charlie Watts expounds for more than a grunt and a snarl, genuinely answering questions from an off camera interviewer.  Hard to imagine that the footage was gleaned from only 2 or 3 days during an Ireland tour in '65, this is a brilliantly edited slice of life within the Stones maelstrom at their very early peak.  The sound is big and full, the stage footage from the wings is electric, fantastic film making on every level, 5 stars for this recently remastered doc from 47 year old 35mm reels.
B004NSURT4|5.0|Artfully written, this book is fast paced and makes an interesting reading. The end is sad though. Wish the writer had made the couple escape and live happily ever after. Alas! It is not so. A good book to read if u like world war classics.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I've been using the free version (limits to one client) for quite a while. Liked it so much, came real close to buying it (I generally don't get paid apps). Got lucky to find it as free app of the day on amazon, God bless amazon!! Now I can finally remove all the other crappy ones that allowed more than one client. Been using many other RDP apps before, each had its own strengths but many weaknesses. Jump Desktop is the first that had all the strengths and features I need.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have been reading this series for years,  and with all of the great characters, I didn't know how it would ever get finished. This book wrapped it all up,  but not in a \\"hurry up and put an ending out\\"way. I really really enjoyed reading it. In one way I am sad that the series is done. But I am glad that it was welldone.
B001O03NCW|5.0|love the music and the movie! such inspirational songs, and the promise that there is hope for repentance and new life!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was an AWESOME book.  I couldn't put it down.  I lent it to a friend and she read it in one day because she couldn't put it down. It was intriguing from start to finish, well written with a very interesting story line.  Read it....you'll love it.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I'll never forget being at a friends house when they told me they wanted to watch Star Trek TNG before we head out to the bar . I was a huge fan of the original series and of the movies . I had seen about 8 episodes of TNG before this night and was unimpressed . We did not know that this nights episode was the season ending cliffhanger &#34;The Best Of Both Worlds&#34; pt 1 . Wow ! I was hooked and could not wait til the next season . Over the summer I watched the reruns of season 3 . At first I felt that some of the episodes were a little dull , but I found myself getting to like the characters , just like in the original series . Then I really began to like the show . After seeing the episode &#34;Yesterdays Enterprise&#34; I new this series could end up being as good as the original series . The creators found their mojo . Season 4 began the following season and it was one great episode after another until the series ended . Is TNG better that the original crew ? WHO CARES ! To be able to create two outstanding series based on the Enterprise is truely an amazing achievement . The bluray edition is wonderful . Since I already own season 3 on dvd I can tell you the picture quality is Improved . As with the dvd , picture quality varies and sometimes within the same episode . The new DTS Master Audio is fantastic . One thing I always like about the audio is the engine hum you hear whenever they are on the Enterprise . It's just one of those little things that make it seem more believable .The DTS mix is about the same as the dvd as far as channel seperation is concerned , but the audio has more impact on the bluray . Looking back I can't believe this show almost got past me . But then again , I was also a late-comer to &#34;Lost&#34; and &#34;Seinfeld&#34; . I would recommend this to a friend and would recommend upgrading to bluray if you are a fan .
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Take Robert Jordan's attention to detail and add Brandon Sanderson's humor and you have a great book.  A must read if you've gotten this far in the Wheel of Time.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|somewhat standard horror flick but well worth the spent spent viewing. Good performance put in by Ethan Hawke and supporting cast
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Was good game with interesting puzzles mixed in with hidden object scenes all set in a mystery-themed story.  Better than most.  Would recommend to anyone.  Also a bit longer than most games of this sort thankfully.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was just so gripping you just can't put it down.  One of the best series I have read in a long time.  I'll read it again and again.
B000HZGCEG|5.0|The portrayal of the trauma one would go through dealing with feudal England and France coming from the 20th century was enacted perfectly.  A lot of violence but they did land in the middle of a war...be forewarned.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Thought provoking as well as heartrending, Life of Pi moves you through a sea of emotions,  sometimes subtlely like a calm tide and at other times like an ocean storm. You'll laugh, cry, and self reflect as you move through this book,  and long after you finish it.  The author paints a vivid picture of a desperate time in a young man's life where he is forced through experiences that form and transform him, pushing the envelope of doubt and faith until, ultimately, true redemption is realized.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I am a runner and earbuds just dont work for me, they fall out of my ears and fill my ears with sweat etc etc.  These are old school and i have owned many.  Quality sony product with great sound.  Only warning would be if you are using these in strong winds they tend to make loud noise in your ears...some people tie small pieces of terry cloth to them just above speakers to absorb sweat and prevent the howling wind noise.

B006YTTVHO|5.0|There is so much to communication and this book definitely makes it easy. I especially liked the section on 10 interesting topics for conversations such as \\"who is the most interesting person you have ever met?\\"
B009AMANH4|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, but as expected, it was not totally historical correct; Producer takes lots of licences. But they never advertized it as such. Sit back and enjoy the show.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Huge RUSH fan and this is the best album hands down since Roll The Bones...it is Signals meets 2112 they are rocking out hard again but also throwing in some modern ballads.  The qualtiy of the product is first rate and you wont find this for any cheaper and you just walk out your front door and there it is...no trip to store.
B000P0J09W|3.0|I got this as a semi classic for our 4year old son. We all enjoyed watching it, but I forgot how much swearing there was in it, it was littered with it.<br /><br />Over all i would not buy this movie again. Its a kids movie and has entirely too much language.
B005LAIISU|5.0|my kids and me love to watch this movie, great addition to the ice age series.  not much more to say than that.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I never received this book. It showed me receiving it but it would not open up.  This was a free book, so I didn't complain
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this is pure quality,  shows like this come around once a decade and is pure enjoyment. I watched the first three seasons and went back and watched the first season again.
B0031RS44S|5.0|Most enjoyable, true to Jack Reacher form, loads of suspense as the intriguing plot unfolds and the characters are introduced
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game.  All the things you like about this game with no hassles.<br />Ads are no problem just click on skip and go to your new game.  It even has a hints button to help newbies when you get stuck.  You can't go wrong downloading this game.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I liked it because it never slowed or got boring. It was a little dark but not too depressing. Great movie for a Friday night at home.
B008Q08EV8|5.0|This made for a very entertaining evening for me. I enjoyed the movie very much and do recommend it to others.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|THIS is a great game for preteens and above .  Even the young ate heart.  It's great for raining days and those days that it's to cold to think about going outside for anything.  I really enjoyed it !!!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Picking up where The Selection left off, America is among the contestants vying for the role of Princess and to marry Prince Maxon. The Elite was an easier story to delve right into, as Cass has already set up the world building and initial story in The Selection. Having been months since reading the first book, the author did a fabulous job of recapping characters and scenes without making the story seem bogged down or slow.<br /><br />There were plenty of times I felt my heart race in anticipation, wondering if America would get caught with Aspen, her former childhood friend and boyfriend from back home. I felt my stomach knot at some intense emotional scenes (I don't want to spoil anyone) and even shed a few tears as secrets unfolded near the end of the novel.<br /><br />The Elite offered quite a few twists and turns within the castle walls that I hadn't seen coming. I found the characters Cass writes to be refreshing and complicated - definitely three-dimensional - just like how I like them. I would recommend The Elite to fans of The Selection, to those that love romance with a some Dystopian aspects thrown into the mix.
B0037UUZQY|5.0|I gave it to my friend's daughter for Christmas and she loved it! It was the guest of honor at her third birthday party! It was the perfect size for her little hands too.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I laughed a lot watching this. And I'm a grown up. That might be why I thought it was do funny. Or maybe I still think like a kid. Either way, funny show.
B00BESM14U|2.0|The strength of the movie was that it was taking place in Pittsburgh, I had to drink multiple bottles of Iron City beer to make it through this flick
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I must admit I watched the movie first.  Then I read how much Reacher fans hated Tom Cruise because of his stature.  So I expected to read about tough guy who was also smart.  However I found the Jack Reacher of this book simply to be a brute.  He showed very little insight except in the ways of combat.  I think the quick witted Tom Cruise character in the movie did him favor.  The character in the book seemed more like Steven Segall.  Reacher seemed to be a shoot first- ask questions last kind of guy. I may give it another try to see if the character gets more depth.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Great Movie, it wasn't boring at all, never got slow. Daniel Day-Lewis was great as Lincoln. I would recommend to anyone with an interest in Lincoln or the time period.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I listen to this CD every day.  I love it.  I even listen to it before bed.  I would suggest all music lovers to check it out.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Enjoyed it, mindless entertainment with standard Bruce Willis action.  Guns, explosions, romance and old flames reuniting.  Bruce gets the young woman and Helen Miran finds her old beau.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I have been listening to DM since 1984, &#34;People Are People&#34; was one of the first tapes I bought on my own when I was only 7 or 8 years old. I love how they have continuously made each album a unique evolution while retaining a distinctive DM sound across the different eras.<br /><br />This album is a characteristically superb effort. I'm still in the phase of hitting favorite tracks while taking more time to digest the others. Straight away the track &#34;Alone&#34; jumped out as fantastic. When it ends I simply want to play it again. I recommend the deluxe version of this album as it includes some great bonus tracks.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love Downton Abbey! The third season was just as great as the other two. I obsessed over the season finale for days and I can't wait for the fourth season! I would recommend to anyone with an interest in the time period and to anyone who loves Jane Austen novels!
1476734941|4.0|I've been on it for 3 weeks now and each week I've lost weight following the suggestions from this book!
006114665X|5.0|This is a magisterial work by an Australian-born history professor--666 pages of text and footnotes.  I have done a lot of reading on this tantalizing subject, including Sidney Fay's two volumes (read March 1968) and Albertini's three-volume work, read in the spring of 1986, and July 1914: The Long Debate, by John W. Langdon. (read 14 Nov 1992), as well as David Fromkin's Europe's Last Summer (read 7 Apr 2004)  This book may not tell you what you want to hear but the author is really persuasive in his careful account, even though when you finish the book you may not know who is mostly responsible for the Great War, but you will know that the people who blundered into that war did not know what evil they were to see come to the world by their actions and inactions.
1400069742|5.0|My friend in New Jersey called me to tell me I must read this.  I immediately ordered it, and it came within two days.  I am now enjoying reading it, especially since I lived through the time period about which it is written.
B0080M3OGW|5.0|I truly love this movie!!!!!!!!!!! I would buy it in a heart beat!!!!!!!!! If you like beautiful love stories I would recommend it. Thank you, A. Bradford
B000FC13UE|5.0|I loved this selection of short stories and, as with Good Omens, I wonder why I waited so long to read it! A little of everything from Mr. Gaiman (I'm a fan of Sandman and The Graveyard Book and American Gods ... well everything of his I've read so far). Some very dark material here, but also some funny stuff, and some darkly funny stuff, and some short things and some longer things. Read it, it's entirely worth the time and money. I may actually buy a hard copy now (I originally purchased it for my Kindle).
B00447L4KA|5.0|While there are certainly situations and actions in this movie that border on the slapstick, this movie doesn't  condescend to teens.  It's &#34;Taming of the Shrew,&#34; 21st century-style, and it's funny and serious and eye-rolling and big smiles - up and down, just like teens are wont to be.
1455869910|5.0|I've read this book three times in the last than 6 months. Each time I read it I find something else to love. You will laugh, you will cry, and every book you read after it will seem disappointing (the only downfall of this novel). I would review further but I don't think it's necessary. Buy the book and enjoy.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Must see from the beginning. Very suspenseful and action packed. My son loves it as well.<br /><br />5 stars for the cast!
B005ERIRZE|5.0|Not just a book about science, but a book that makes you do experiments on yourself, and ones that work.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton is so addicting. Great character development and depth. Always a surprise. It has you rooting for the same characters you started off disliking. It shows each character in a very human way with a mix of good and bad just like we all have.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like to hear the sound of rain at night when I am trying to sleep. Most of the apps I download for this have short loops and an audible break when the loop repeats. I find that irritating. This app didn't seem to have that and it has so many selections to choose from, plus you can mix them together. I really liked it. It's the first app I ever paid money for.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I had already purchased the c.d. of \\"Love\\" about a year ago. The more I listened, the more I liked. Sure, many of these recordings differ substantially from the originals, but so what. Those versions still exist in recent remasters. I don't understand the \\"purists\\" who object to any reworking of the familiar versions. First off, it should be clear that this is a soundtrack to a show. If it had been anyone but George Martin (and son Giles), who many consider the fifth Beatle, I, too, would have been skeptical, However, what these two have accomplished is nothing less than revelatory. The blending of sounds and elements of a substantial part of the catalog is creatively and respectfully accomplished. This collage is deliciously tantalizing. The mix, for the most part, sounds just right, even if, on paper, the choices might seem counterintuitive. Apart from the purists, I believe fans will get the biggest kick out of trying to identify the sources of all the foreground and background bits and pieces. Even on the regular c.d., the sound is terrific, presenting recordings made more than 40 years ago on predigital mono and basic stereo equipment, and making them sound as if they were recorded yesterday. From the opening a cappella version of \\"Because\\", the depth and presence is breathtaking. Those with decent 5.1 surround systems are in for a special treat. The surrounds are never gimmicky, but amplify the listening experience beyond measure. Unlike most 5.1. remixers, the Martins had a lot of time and a substantial budget to work their sonic magic. If you have DTS capability, that's the option to choose. It's not for nothing that this project was awarded the Grammy for best surround album of the year, Enjoy!

B008602KQI|3.0|The books were well written and certainly will capture your attention.  I read  all three but constantly in the back of my mind had concern with the concept of kids killing each other.  The brutally bothered me.  I did not and would not see the movie.

0920668372|1.0|My daughter brought this home as a reward from school. She picked it because of the baby on the cover. I had never heard of it. This book started out very sweet then it went to creepy and ended very sad. Not a fan of this book and it will not be in our collection.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoy romance books, and I was skeptical about this one at first. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put my kindle down! I would suggest this book to anyone! And even better...IT'S FREE!!

1611761565|5.0|In my opinion this is an excellent recounting of the events that led up to the Mission as well as the rigors of being a Navy Seal.  This book isn't a back slapping tale of how wonderful the author is. He is just a quick to point out his flaws or shortcomings as he is to highlight the best in others. I appreciated that author Mark Owen included a lengthy statement at the beginning indicating that no secrets were revealed and that hit had been vetted by military authorities.  Very much appreciate the sacrifices these soldiers make!  I only have a general knowledge of weaponry but could still &#34;get the jist&#34; of what was being described.  I definitely recommend.
0812982622|3.0|When I was a child, my mother would sometimes send me down into the cellar to retrieve something.  With each step down into the cool, dim and damp cellar, I would get an uneasy feeling of dread.  I got that very same feeling after reading only a few chapters.  The author has done a masterful job of creating a bizarre chilling tone throughout this almost impossible to describe book.<br /><br />That said, the plot of the book (if you could call it that), was at times for me almost impossible to follow.  At times I almost gave up, but after reading some reviews on Amazon, I plowed on through and must admit, I'm glad I did.  But it wasn't easy.  What is real?  What is imagined?  What is created by the state?<br /><br />There is humor (again, if you could call it that), but it isn't the least bit funny.  There is torture, bizarre scenes of deprivation, and disturbing scenes that come across as very believable in the midst of events that seem impossible.  Could this really be life in North Korea?  Is it possible to manipulate people to this extent?  I don't know, but do know the book provides plenty of things to think about.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|They tried to hard on this movie. The third one was well done, and they tried to just randomly add in some crappy storyline for this one, but it failed. Just did not have the nice jumpy scenes like the first three did.
B009AMANH4|5.0|A Beautiful Portrait of what a Great PRESIDENT had to deal with. A very close and true  epic of the Cival War as well.  The Director  took all the books on Lincoln  and made it into this,  it puts you right there like you are sitting in the rooms with HIM.  A must have for everyone

B005EVV5GI|5.0|Would-be Mahler complete-ists will want to add this attractive 6-disc box set of Klemperer's 60s-era recordings to their collection, alongside the recent Sony compilation of Bruno Walter's Mahler readings. These sets, from the composer's two most prominent younger associates and friends who lived into the age of stereo recording, offer, together, as complete and authentic a picture of Mahler's musical mind as we will ever be likely to obtain short of time travel.<br /><br />The Klemperer set was issued in 2011 by French EMI, and features recent 24-bit digital remasterings with overall excellent sonics. The 1961 reading of the 4th Symphony with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and the Philharmonia Orchestra still comes across as rather turgid and, in places, poorly defined, but elsewhere, the sound quality is greatly improved, revealing detail and color often missed in earlier transfers.<br /><br />Klemperer first met Mahler in 1907, when the young conductor led the off-stage brass in a performance of the Resurrection Symphony (#2), the work which opens this set. A very fine performance it is, too, recorded between November 1961 and March 1962 with the Philharmonia Orchestra and chorus, and soloists Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (soprano), and alto, Hilde Rössl-Majdan. The pacing is superb, the dramatic impact undeniable. It is interesting to compare this performance with Walter's 1958 Columbia Symphony outing; the conductors' two very different personalities are revealed in subtle variations of detail and emphasis, and in the end, who takes the laurel may come down to the chorus and soloists one prefers.<br /><br />Klemperer's reading of the 9th Symphony is one of the very greatest; again, equaled only by Walter's 1961 performance with the Columbia Symphony, though Klemperer benefits from EMI's superior sound quality. The tempi are typically deliberate, revealing rich detail in the score without loss of momentum or coherency. The slow valedictory outer movements have never been so beautiful or so poignant.<br /><br />But the heart of this set is the 7th Symphony  (\\"Nachtlied\\" or \\"Song of the Night\\"). This performance, from September 1968, shows Klemperer at his most uncompromisingly determined and stubbornly controversial; certainly, few others have ever plumbed the emotional depths of this music with such insight and empathy. The long funeral march of the first movement is utterly shattering in its kinetic force, all the more so because of Klemperer's theatrically lugubrious pacing. Yet, the finale, clocking in at a sprawling 24:15 briefly calls this approach into question. Markedly more deliberate than any other performance of the work, Klemperer is a full eight minutes slower than Solti's brisk 1971 performance for Decca, and nearly six to seven minutes  longer than James Levine (RCA, 1982) or Claudio Abbado (DG, 2002). At times, one fears the music may collapse under its own weight, the structure disintegrate altogether, or simply peter out. And yet, somehow, miraculously, Klemperer pulls it off; his 7th an enduring profile in artistic courage.<br /><br />Rounding out the set is a magnificent performance of \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\" (\\"Song of the Earth\\"); perhaps one of the finest ever recorded, notwithstanding fierce competition from a dozen or more top-tier versions. Where many renditions of the piece feature one outstanding soloist paired with another less inspired artist (Walter's two well-known readings come immediately to mind), Klemperer had the good fortune to work with a duo of equally brilliant singers, both at the height of their powers, a young Christa Ludwig near the beginning of her career, and the inimitable Fritz Wunderlich shortly before his untimely death. The piece was recorded in two sessions in February and November 1964. The sound is impeccable, sparkling and richly textured, capturing every colorful nuance of the score. Vocal characterizations are nigh on to sublime, and, for once, everything is equally memorable, fromthe virile horn calls of the opening bars to the deep sighs of \\"ewig, ewig\\" (\\"forever, forever\\") in a fading autumnal halo of strings that brings the piece at last to rest, and all the glorious humor, passion and elation in between.<br /><br />Filler on the set includes Ludwig's admirable performances of three songs from \\"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\\" and three of the five Rückert Lieder, recorded during the same 1964 sessions as \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\", and included in the original LP box-set issue of DLvdE from the following year.  Interestingly, EMI chose to record a more extensive album of songs from \\"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\\" in 1966, not with Ludwig, but with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau under Geroge Szell--a fine recording in its own right to be sure. Yet, Ludwig's readings are so wonderfully tantalizing as to leave us wishing for more. Her lovely voice and youthful passion simply make Schwarzkopf seem tired by comparison, and, most unflatteringly on occasion, past her prime.<br /><br />Klemperer's Mahler is historically significant and artistically compelling. This set is highly recommended.

B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Love this movie. Great for adults and children. My 2 year old loves it. Very funny and better than most other cartoon movies.
076115678X|5.0|I bought this book because my adorable 8yr old daughter has VERY curly hair(thank you Irish grandma), I do not have curly hair and so it proved difficult to figure out what to do with her hair. Most days it was frizzy and looked like she rolled out of bed and stuck her finger in a light socket. We ALWAYS told her though how lucky she was to have such beautiful curls(thankful we did that after reading this book). This book has brought sanity to my life, no more tears due to uncontrollable tangles and now I know how to do it. It's especially nice to read a book for curly girls that does not advocate for TONS of icky/chemical laden products, I've read plenty of those and just couldn't bring myself to put those types of product on her hair. We have always used organic shampoo/conditioner so it was nice to read this book and know that we were headed down the right path and now with a bit of change to our routine and an addition of a few home made NATURAL products(this book gives amazing recipes) things are going great. My daughter wakes up everyday so excited to have her sprayed with either conditioner or lavender spray. Please consider buying this book as a gift for someone who does not have curly hair but there child does.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I do not have the BBC channel so I was lost when I saw that this show had been nominated for and won so many awards. After watching seasons one and two I can see that this show is well worth all the accolades it has received. I was hesitant to become a prime member but being able to watch this show and many others as well as the free shipping has been well worth the price. I am only a few months in and the money I have saved has already paid for my membership.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Part of me wanted to drop the star rating because I did not want the story to end. I was left with some questions, and with an insatiable desire to see where the heroes lives would end up. What a great epic story!​
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed reading the series, and could not wait to find out what happened so I started reading this one immediately after finishing Catching Fire. Although I couldn't put it down, I was a little disappointed in it. The ending wrapped everything up and told me what I wanted to know, for the most part, but I felt like after devoting 3 books to these characters, I would've liked to know a little more. I don't want to spoil the middle of the book, but I felt like I could've lived with a little less of that part of the story, although I don't honestly know what I would remove, it just seemed that it started to drag on a bit. After all that the characters have been through, especially Peeta and Katniss, I wouldn't expect a fairytale ending (she mentions her psychological issues/nightmares from just the 1st hunger games even in the second book), but I would've liked to have a few questions answered and a little more development to the ending. There were some good twists to the story that I really enjoyed, some that shocked me, and some that made me cry. If you have read the other two, I would definitely finish it up with this one!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A book written in such a way that you go from really liking ans sympathizing with the main characters to really disliking them.  While I &#34;hated&#34; the ending, it certainly shows how real life can sometimes actually look.  A real page turner that draws you into these two peoples psyches.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Great app for my kids to play.  I need to get a new Kindle Fire - my old one has run out of memory and won't run the app, so they fight over my phone ... but they love it.
0316067598|5.0|By far one the greatest books I have read this year. Once I opened the book it was almost impossible to set down. The book bleeds patriotism, faith, service.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The story is so full of action, twists and turns that I found it hard to put down because I just had to know how it would end...and who would save who? Although the storyline had a lot of the same elements from the first book (the games), it was still a lot different. I enjoyed the new characters in this book.
0393327345|5.0|In life more often then npt you will be told that you are a unique indivual and there is no one else like you. Well in this story it is much different than that. Fight Club is an extremely different book. That is not told in chronological order, which adds to the effects on the reader. A lot of the common thoughts of being your own person and specialized to do your own tasks in life and always being great isn't the idea of Fight Club, it's just the opposite. The narrator is a man that has to deal with insomnia and to make matters worse; he has to travel around the country for his job. So he and his new best friend make a club, called Fight Club. Ohh wait, I just broke the first rule of Fight Club. Don't talk about Fight Club. This club quickly spreads and grows to hundreds of members which is a good thing until a simply private club turns into another club that makes a turn for the worse.<br />With many dramatic events and life altering decisions this book deserves a ten! This is a phenomenal book, but it's not for everyone. If you're the kind of person who always hears positive and imagine the thought of negativity, then don't read this book. It's by all means not a negative book; it's just a very different way to like at a population. This is a highly recommended book for anyone who is a philosophical type of person. Go read Fight Club and have a different view of the world, maybe it will even alter your thoughts.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love being able to watch (and re-watch) this series.  Even my husband, when he stops long enough, will watch it with me and enjoy.
B000FDECGA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Too bad I waited almost 30 years to watch it. Like the retro music that went along with it and the film is fast paced and action packed. I have the five disc series and I can't wait to watch the original ones called Lone Wolf and Cub.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is great, it is definitely better is some aspects that the movie because you get more information/history with the book than you do the movie.  The book is really well written!!

B000003CKH|5.0|When my daughter said she wanted Cake for her birthday, I said what flavor. The answer was it is band. She loves the music.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|WONDERFUL Movie.  I am very sad that the series was cancelled.  It would be nice if more Firefly movies could be made.  I don't know if I'd say I want the series back because I love Castle and Nathan Fillion is the star in that series.  Also Gina Torres is on the series Suits.  So there is 2 of the stars on two other popular TV series, so Movies would be a good thing!!!  :-D  A VERY GOOD THING!!!  But I want Alan Tudyk back as Wash along with all the original cast!!!!!!!
B005K17RU0|3.0|We live in very Rural California, And I only get Wi-Fi at our  Rural Free Library, I try to go every day, but I just do not get there.  Hoping it will be used more while we are on the road.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|I was interested to see what the life of Shirley MacLaine's daughter was like.  It was definitely a journey.  Many times a dark one.  This is a story of survival.  I could not put this book down.  Sachi Parker is to be admired!
B007WFR0QS|5.0|My teenage daughter wanted it for her birthday. She loves the band. I have never heard of it, but can say one of the songs does sound familiar.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is a wonderful Sci-Fi Series!  It is too bad that during it's initial run that it was cancelled 1/2 way through it's 1st season.  Only the true Browncoat followers know how great this series is!  If only the network would have given the series a chance and put it in a much better viewing slot, the would have seen how great of a series this could have been to them!!  But they lost their chance.  This series is terrific!!!  I enjoy viewing it over and over and over again!  It's addictive, in a good way!  Get the series and give it a chance!  If you like Star Wars and Star Trek it's kinda a mix of these plus a whole lot more!
B0013HYLT0|5.0|Wonderful music and great fun to sing along with.  We have had hours of fun together as a family over the witty humor and truth in this movie and these songs.  Can't go wrong with this.
B009R659L8|4.0|Mary Higgins Clark again does an exceptional job.  Love her books.<br />Only complaint I had was that I bought the e-book Kindle edition and throughout the entire book it either skips sentences or repeated sentences when going page by page and the font sytle would be in very small print or large print throughout the book.<br />I even reloaded the book to see if that fixed anything and it didn't.  Other than that I loved the story lines.
B00770KR7W|5.0|He is in my office at work keeping an eye on things while I'm not there. Little small but still very cool

B00AB7HESI|5.0|I chose this to encourage my son to have more initiative when it came to spelling. This is a great motivator and has really helped him sound things out.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It was hard to read this book knowing that the ending would not be at the end of the chapters. I am truly grateful for the service and sacrifice Chris Kyle and all of our men and women serving give for us. God bless our soldiers and God bless and watch over their families and loved ones.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I loved this book. My business produces occasional bursts of commission income so I have been looking for other revenue streams - preferably steady ones - for quite some time. This book and The 4-Hour Work Week have been great motivators to get me focused on making that happen.
0385366752|5.0|Not the book for everyone, some of our book club members really didn't like it.  I thought it was fun and funny

B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've ever read. IF YOU LOVE ROMANCE AND TEEN FICTION READ THIS.
0307477479|3.0|This is not the type of book I usually read, however it was interesting to read something different.  Don't know if I would recommend this to my friends
B003VANOFY|2.0|I loved the G930 headset when I received it. Although it was slightly heavy for my liking, the awesome sound quality from the headset with a great microphone quickly led me to ignore the issues I had with the weight of the headset. The closed ear cup design cut out ambient noise and allowed be to get completely immersed in the game, (sometimes to the displeasure of my family as they needed to come really close to me and shout to put their point across when I used the headset). The 7.1 Dolby surround worked great to provide positional audio in game. So for all you gamers in a noisy environment, this headset will prove pretty good to cut out the noise and provide awesome sounds.<br /><br />Although I liked the headset a lot, my usage of this one was extremely short lived. This headset broke with normal usage within 4 months of use. I looked up the forums and noticed most users have been complaining of the same. There is a small plastic piece that attaches the ear cups unit to the metal frame in the headband. This joint is extremely fragile and breaks off easily. That's what happened to me and to a lot of others who bought this headset as you can see in the Logitech forums.<br /><br />With a brand like Logitech I hoped the local service center would have been able to help, however I was mistaken as they refused to help mentioning they do not support this product in India. I am now stranded with a broken headset that plays the sound well but cant be used.<br />The low rating is because of a poorly constructed headset with inadequate support service but great sound quality at a decent price.<br /><br />Have any of you faced this issue or have figured out a way to repair / replace the headset? I am still looking for help and suggestions to resolve my problem with this headset.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It was an intense story that had me on the edge of my seat. Looking forward to purchasing this title.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This is another game that only allows you to play for 10 minutes or so a day. You start a project and then have to wait for it to finish.<br />Some projects ate 10 seconds some are 10 hours.<br />When I am in the mood to waste some time on a game, I would like to play it in more than 30 second spurts.

B008476HBM|4.0|This is a great read.  Love the period and the manner of life and times.  Sometimes you need a read over to get the jest of what they are saying.
0385349947|5.0|Lean In is about women stepping up for themselves.  Many women have forgotten how to speak up for themselves and they wait to be recognized for their achievements.  Unfortunately that doesn't get them where they want to go.  Some women were never schooled on how to speak up...verbally or in their actions.  This is a good book to get the conversations going and awareness levels up.<br />After 27 years as a financial advisor in a male dominated industry, I decided to step up and mentor and coach Female Financial Advisors how to reawaken their Moxie and put themselves out there to be seen.<br />It is such a fun process and sure beats the alternative.<br />Moxie is the courage to be audacious!<br />Judy Brosky<br />[...]

B004T2QZL8|3.0|I just bought this game today not even an hour ago. It force closes all the time, it does it when I first open the game up, if I get lucky it lets me get to almost the end of the intro then closes. Now I did try the free version before buying the game. I loved the game when i did first try it. Now I cant even play it, yea its a dollar but now im out an dollar. I would love it if you fixed this problem. If you do ill rate it a 5 star. It is a 5 star game but with the force closing issue its not worth 5 right now. it barely makes the 3 I gave it!
B004EF65QA|5.0|Anyone who loves Pride & Prejudice or Downton Abbey will love North and South.  Its a romance for a thinking person.  I loved the acting especially that of Richard Armitage.  Its not a very long series, only four episodes.  Don't expect the grandeur of Downton Abbey because this takes place in the industrial north and with the working class.  The sets and costumes are dark and dreary but they match the place and time.  The story is not dreary though, it centers around a young woman who has moved to another way of life and how she adjusts to it.  It gives you lots to reflect on in regards to class and gender issues from that time.  Overall, a must see for those that love this type of drama/romance.
B0082XJGRK|1.0|This was one of the worst free ebook &#34;purchases&#34;. I wanted some history AND to learn how to meditate... this book is not for beginers so it was all gibbersih to me. thumbs down.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved Downton Abbey Season 3 just as much as Season 1&2.  I can't wait for Season 4 to air!

1556438850|3.0|This text book is not very well organized.  In that I felt that things that should have been in the glossary were not.  There are no bold words for the ones that are.  He mentions the sanskrit word and no english one to follow.  The author is very opinionated and assumes that the reader already knows.  I got more info from yoga journal and online than I did from this textbook.
0446585041|5.0|I really wanted to read this book but did not want to pay full price. I bought this for about $8 which included shipping. You can't even tell it is used.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy playing hidden games but I find that at times this game will not load I get kicked out I don't know why
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|I don't think there's really anything more to add. If you're a Green Day fan, you'll want to add this to your collection.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|EXCELLENT 3D. THE MOVIE IS GREAT !!!!<br />I RECOMMEND THIS 3D BLU RAY MOVIE . YOU HAVE 2 VERSIONS ON THE DISC THE 3D AND THE 2D.
B004LOJPLQ|5.0|This was one of the worst marketed and poorly promoted films ever.  The title is misleading, the advertising was wrong, hell...even the DVD cover leads you astray.  Yes, the lead character is a boxer, but practically the last thing this film is about is \\"fighting.\\"  There's some boxing, and a lot of metaphorical fighting, but 'The Fighter' is far, far more than a film about a boxer.<br />This is a movie of struggle and triumph over PERSONAL battles, and it is definitely on my list of truly excellent films.  Christian Bale's performance is nothing short of breathtaking, Melissa Leo is spectacular...both won well deserved Oscars.  Add another strong performance by Amy Adams, and you have one helluva ensemble.<br />There are other reviews offering a plot summary...but I'm beggin' ya...buy/rent this film for the acting.
B0019IB0II|1.0|Bought this thinking it would help me help my mother. Laughable, nonsensical and convoluted was what it turned out to be. I could go on and on as the author did about why this was a waste of time but I can sum it up more succi
B00AEFVRB2|3.0|The cast is all good. There are enough twists and turns to the plot. We are supposed to care about some pretty awful people.And you know what? We do care about them, but I'd rather see something with a little more character development and a little less brutality.
B000AOA2G8|5.0|I received the item, but one of the the hex screw pin heads for the pin spanner was broken off. I was still able to use the tool to do the job I needed it to do in the time I needed it done by. I let Amazon know, and within hours I received a notification that a new item had already been shipped out.  I received a brand new one in two days time.  That is exactly why I will continue to shop on Amazon.  Best online shopping service that exists. Thanks
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was drawn in to the story almost immediately. Strong core characters. Interesting courtroom procedural. I read it during my commute to work and was often disappointed that the train had reached the station.  Stunning ending.

0062014536|4.0|With the freedom of free will and the ability to love comes the consequence of loss, grief and pain. But for many, the freedoms are worth the consequences. In Lauren Oliver's final installment of the Delirium  series, Requiem, we find out just how far the resistance will go to stop a world only interested in keeping its citizens numb and uncaring.<br /><br />Lena<br />Having saved Julian and reuniting with Alex, Lena now bears a heavy cross. Alex has been cured, which has left him a different person- closed off, reserved, and disconnected from everything he shared with Lena. With Alex so different, Lena is drawn closer to Julian, but even Julian knows she still loves the old Alex. Even if the old Alex is gone. But boys aside, the people in the Wilds are no longer safe. They used to be protected by the fact that the government didn't want to acknowledge their existence, but since their very public demonstrations, that is no longer possible. Now they are hunting down everyone in the Wilds with one purpose: total extinction for all uncured people. But the uncured must decide their path. Do they fight back, or do they run? The decision will change Lena's life forever.<br /><br />Hana<br />Hana was cured, but it didn't take. She is still haunted by dreams and emotions she shouldn't have to worry about. But her pair has been made and she is to marry the new mayor. She should be happy about the favorable match, but all she can think about is Lena. Where is she? What happened to her? When rumors of rebels get around, Hana begins to see Fred's true colors. Determined to stamp out all rebellion, Fred clearly aspires to be a true dictator. But with the population scared of the rebels, they look to Fred to protect them, even if it means they will lose more and more of their freedoms.<br /><br />Again, I loved having two different perspectives to the story. With Oliver's previous novels, we have seen this alternating perspective, which she does particularly well. It really allows you to see both sides of the wall (pun intended) and doesn't bias the story. When you watch the rebels doing what rebels do best- fighting back- you realize this isn't the best situation for everyone. But still, there is no doubt what a monster Fred is. I always like Hana, so I was really happy to see more of her in this story. But Fred was the prize for me in terms of characters. He was the kind of man you LOVE to hate, which kept me coming back to see where his storyline went.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this novel is that it is supposed to be a conclusion where everything is laid on the table. And it was certainly shaping up to be just that, but something got lost at the very end. Instead of a complete and satisfying conclusion, it felt rushed and empty. I wanted more. In fact, it ended like a typical chapter conclusion, not the end of a trilogy. I actually kept reading expected more only to realize that was the acknowledgments section. Where did the end of the book go? I am sad this didn't end in the best way for me because otherwise, I really loved this series. It was well written and read easily. But Oliver does like to put out those short stories, so maybe she will release something for after Requiem. It's just too bad she didn't put it all in the book.s you to see both sides of the wall (pun intended) and doesn't bias the story.

B00BVYNSLC|4.0|Orphan Black isn't a clone of another show on TV. It's as original as a show can be these days.<br />The acting is ok, the writing is ok, but the premise of the show is what got it 4 stars instead of 3.<br />Hopefully it'll be around long enough to see it grow and improve.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|From beginning to end this was one of the most enjoyable docs I've ever watched. I HIGHLY recommend this film!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved the movie like pace and feel of this book.  Also his note at the end that it is not based on any true event or anything that has happened.  It is just an entertaining story.  I am a huge John Grisham fan, and this book did not disappoint!!

B00821OX98|5.0|A very intense program with good plot and a factual historical narrative in that it has roots in our nation's birth. Many subtle and overt American Revolution references,  all with super cool and nasty Aliens. My wife and I both love it and can't wait for the next season.
1878424939|5.0|The book is beautiful to look at it just makes me feel good. The information is easy to read and understand and it sure explains why we have so many problems and why they header our lives. I will read this book again an again. I'm reading five levels of Attachments by his son : TOLTEC
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow. That was the most awesome and sad books in the whole world it was so good I loved it.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|I thought the movie was okay. I think most horror movies today are mostly alike. I don't think I would recommend to anyone else
B007GNMJYE|5.0|Most of my music collection is not pop music.  It's eclectic, but mostly indie.  That being said I think this is an absolute triumph of pop music artistry.  It's catchy, it's quirky, it's honest, and best-of-all the artist actually contributes to the songwriting.  I really have no respect for artists that simply sing (likely auto-tuned) and dance but have little if any creativity.<br /><br />In any case I first heard about Marina from hearing \\"Primadonna\\" on the radio.  I thought it was a very catchy and very clever pop song.  Furthermore I thought Marina had a very pleasant voice and good vocal range.  Obviously going with Dr. Luke as the producer of this song was a good choice as he really knew how to give the song that very infectious beat that makes you want to bob your head.<br /><br />I started looking for more of her songs and the next one I heard was \\"Power and Control\\".  I was arguably even more impressed with that song, not only because of the stark contrast to \\"Primadonna\\" but because it also emphasized the honesty of her songs, her great vocal range, and the overall dark subject matter of the album itself.  After hearing this song I knew she wasn't just a one-hit-wonder.<br /><br />I heard essentially the whole album before I bought it, but listening to the songs in bits and pieces just isn't the same as listening to the album all the way through.  There really is a good focus to the album.  Even if I didn't hear her explain it in an interview the album is obviously about the darker side of love and relationships.  \\"Primadonna\\" is probably the most out-of-place song on the album but it's such a pleasure on its own you really couldn't leave it out.  After owning the album for about 4 or 5 weeks I've probably listened to it 12 times in succession.  \\"Lies\\", \\"In The Valley of The Dolls\\", \\"Lonely Hearts Club\\", and \\"Buy the Stars\\" are the best songs on the album that don't have a single.  Of course the singles themselves are good too.<br /><br />I was a littledisappointed to discover that \\"How to be a Heartbreaker\\" is not on the Deluxe Edition of the album.  It isn't exactly one of my favorites, but it's just annoying that one CD doesn't have it all.  I definitely think I bought the better version though, since I'd be giving up \\"Lonely Hearts Club\\", \\"Radioactive\\", and \\"Buy The Stars\\".<br /><br />This isn't a Britney Spears album, Marina can actually write and sing, and this isn't a Katy Perry album, you can actually tell each song has a personal meaning for her.  She's not a fad, she's here to stay, love you Marina, every day!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you love the show, if you feel like you never can find a book that immerses your mind into the story, this is it. A Game of Thrones. More twists, side plots, love, death, and laughter that you can experience with others who are already reading it. The show is great, but if you want the details, buy it now!

B0098VXN2Y|5.0|This movie was cute, funny, and realistic. me and my Husband enjoyed watching this. So glad they had it on Prime!
0891419063|5.0|This book is a true, unexaggerated, first hand account of the Pacific Island Wars of World War II that Private E.B. Sledge was a part of. Mr. Sledge has an amazing way of communicating his story to us readers. He is brutally honest. I have read many books pertaining to military battles, but this one is one of, if not the, best I've ever read. Highly recommend this book.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, plus it gives you an opportunity to chat with and get to know the other players. I also love that it's available through just about every medium there is, so I can play anywhere!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Ridiculous additional scenes. Sooooo long. I love the books and have read them many times.  The movie drug on and on.
B00BOL126U|4.0|For me, the season started out very interesting. The cinematography was great, the acting was on par with any other major tv show and the storyline was, well interesting enough to keep me watching. The second half of the season I felt like they were really starting to lean on 'the gods' as if they were real and that was sort of a turn off for me personally. I understand that they believed that their gods were real but to dedicate an entire episode on the 'sacrifice' to their gods it felt a bit more like the writers were promoting an agenda rather than telling us a story about the 'vikings'. Overall I say it's worth 3-4 stars. Hopefully season two will pick up where the first half of season one left off.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Just like the book, I have enjoyed this portion of the film. I am looking forward to the sequels when they are released.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|A great app. Interface is simple, clean, intuitive and works perfectly. The mini icon on the browser is really useful and easy.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Being the die-hard nerdfighter that I am, I watched John write the book (and sign more pieces of paper than I ever thought possible).  Needless to say, I opened the book with overly high expectations... that were more than met.  First and foremost, The Fault in our Stars is about teenagers living with cancer, but is not a cancer book (because \\"cancer books suck\\").  Instead, its about enjoying life while it lasts.  John easily could have written a self-disparaging book about how life could end at any point in time and what is the point of goals (ok, being John Green and made fully of awesome, I doubt that), but instead its easy to forget that they have terminal cancer and have an expiration date on their lives.<br />Like all of John's books, when you leave Hazel and Augustus's world, it is incredibly hard to return to yours.  The characters grow and develop and are so personal that you feel as if you are leaving your best friend when its dinner time and you have to go eat.  Going into The Fault in our Stars, you know that you are going to cry, but don't realize why.  Instead of breaking down when expected (although I did that too), for me at least, it was a constant eyes-filling-but-never-falling-over type mode.  Quick disclaimer: this is not a sad book.  It is witty, quick, funny, full of life, fantastic, wonderful, and all things positive.  No, I cried because you are just sitting there watching your best friend suffer as everyone else has given up on her and can't do anything about it.  They are the strongest person you know and the bravest.  And all you can do is help them live the remainder of their life to the fullest and try to not miss a moment.<br />I could gush on for another thirty minutes or so, but there are another 3,000 reviews of other people doing that.  I could write a book synopsis, but that's in the book description.  The moral of this story is that I just have a need to share my love with the world and this is how it is happening.  On that note,enjoy, come fangirl with me, and DFTBA.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The cinematography is outstanding. I know about 65% was computer generated, but it is stunning what some computer language can produce in visual enjoyment.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|Ok so finally finished this...for a book I anticipated reading all yr it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The first part of the book was slow for me, about half way thru I felt it picked up speed and the characters didn't feel so bland, and Maxon finally had a back bone and wasn't so wishy washy. I do enjoy Cass' writing and by the end felt anxious to read more. I still don't understand the rebels and what they are trying to accomplish two books later..but I guess this bachelor style book is about the Selection not much else. I don't really see the reason for the aspen/america/maxon love triangle, especially after one of the girls learns the hard way why this isn't allowed, and America continues to sneak around seeing Aspen. Overall it was good with a slow start,  but wasn't as interesting as the first book to me.
0316228532|4.0|I'm still not sure if I liked this book or not. It talks about real life, which in my case isn't the type of book I'd love (and I bet it happens to a lot of Harry Potter fans, like me, who would prefer fantasy stories).<br />It presents MANY characters and at first you get a bit lost (at least in my case, I have a terrible memory).<br />What really surprised me is that after 150 pages or so, I don't know how Rowling did it, but I managed to remember all the characters she intended me to remember, and all the things they've done, their feelings, fears and thoughts. She's a very skillful writer.<br />I'd suggest to those who haven't read it yet, to give it a try.
0062059963|4.0|One of the things I love most about books is that like ice cream, they come in all different \\"flavours\\" ideal for whatever mood you're in. If I had to pair The Elite with a flavour of ice cream, it would definitely be double chocolate chip with fudge and caramel swirls. Sweet, fun and pure indulgence, this is the perfect book to curl up with and lose yourself in the cute and compelling plot.<br /><br />The Elite was one of my most anticipated reads of 2013 and gladly it did not disappoint. I devoured the book in a matter of hours after dancing around the kitchen in my pjs when the ARC landed in my inbox thoroughly frightening my dog and possibly the neighbours!<br /><br />When we last met America Singer, she had just been chosen as one of The Elite. The competition has been culled and the tension is at an all time high as the remaining six girls inch ever closer to the grand prize - Maxon and the throne of Ill&eacute;a. Now as her relationship with the prince deepens she also has to deal with her lingering feelings for Aspen, her first love who in The Selection broke her heart leading to her entering the competition and later showing up as a Palace guard throwing a spanner in the works.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the love triangle is focused on heavily which was equally my favourite and least favourite aspect in particular because of America. While in The Selection she is feisty, independent and truly her own person, in The Elite she unfortunately behaves maddeningly fickle at times. Throughout the book, her personality and behaviour changes depending on which boy she is spending time with and it only takes a smile or a cross word from either of them for her to flip flop between them which I wasn't a fan of. She plays with both boys' emotions which I think was unfair however I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt that her obvious youth plays a big part.  Despite this America never considers just how life changing her decision would be until close to the end and because of this never truly gives much thought to how the boys feel and what they're offering her as it is always too easy for her to switch between them knowing the other would be waiting.<br /><br />When Maxon appears to be playing hard to get and spends more time with the other girls (as is the nature of the competition) America immediately considers it a slight and never once contemplates the many layers of the game and her position in it.<br /><br />While her behaviour was foolish towards the boys, happily she was her regular kick-ass self when it came to the other characters. I loved her interaction with her maids; her friendship with them evolved to a sisterhood filled with emotion and loyalty and was one of my favourite parts of the book. Her defiance to toe the line and accept the status-quo also had me cheering for her and really helped build up the tension and pacing of the book towards the end as America risks all for what she believes in.<br /><br />Because of the smaller group of girls still in the running, we got to know the competition a bit better. In particular Kriss who came out from behind to position herself as a worthy opponent to America. It was interesting to see Maxon interact more with the girls in this book and his behaviour towards them did make me more sympathetic to America's feelings despite her actions at times.<br /><br />The idea of Maxon whispering sweet nothings and sharing stolen kisses and promises with six girls does seem baffling but considering that TV shows such as The Bachelor, Take Me Out and Paradise Island have all been ratings winners over the years the concept isn't as far out as one would think. It's not a position I personally could cope with very well but it does make for riveting reading and Cass holds your attention from start to finish.<br /><br />One of my favourite parts of the book was the development of Maxon and Aspen's characters. While in The Selection both seemed more like Ken dolls, in The Elite they are far more realised.<br /><br />Aspen's feelings for America as well as his reasons for leaving her in The Selection are definitely more understandable and his moments with her are sweet. While he does prove himself to be a worthy suitor for America, I'm afraid Maxon stole my heart in The Selection and The Elite confirmed it.<br /><br />In this book we see just how much pressure he's under to prove himself as both a potential ruler and husband. The idea that as a One he can't possibly know suffering or hardship is truly quashed in this book as some shocking revelations about his past and present come to light which really made my heart break for him as his solitude as a Royal, always having to put on a \\"calm face\\" meant he has had to deal with it on his own with no help from anyone.<br /><br />The world building is developed more in The Elite and we find out just how the state of Ill&eacute;a was born in some shocking revelations and with the rebels gaining more ground and support, the expectation of change particularly with America's influence on Maxon is highly anticipated in book three. The cruelty and injustice of the Caste system is also developed in this book with one stomach churning incident that proved saving face is considered more important than the lives and well being of the citizens of Ill&eacute;a.<br /><br />The position and state of mind America finds herself in at the end of the book is worth all the flip flopping and indecision as Cass leaves us panting for more in what should be an amazing conclusion.<br /><br />This book stirred up so many emotions in me while reading and made me laugh, brought me to tears and experience one dizzying swooning episode I don't think I'll forget for a long time! (Heads up girls! Chapter 8!)<br /><br />The Elite is definitely one of my favourite Spring reads.y are far more realised.<br /><br />Aspen's feelings for America as well as his reasons for leaving her in The Selection are definitely more understandable and his moments with her are sweet.
