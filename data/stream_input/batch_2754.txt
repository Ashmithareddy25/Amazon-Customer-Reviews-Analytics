0670023329|5.0|From the first page, this book had me hooked. You don't even have to be into non-fiction or international politics. It takes you into the cold, cruel, underfed dystopia of a prison camp holding its very own society and culture. This book has given me much insight into human nature. Much more than any fiction. &#34;Are we born good or bad?&#34; is answered by a young man raised from birth to parents suffering from Kim Il Sung's &#34;3 Generations of Punishment&#34; meaning that the children and grandchildren of prisoners are force to live a difficult life in the confines of a secret prison. At times I had to put the book down based on the pure evil the inhabitants faced. Underground torture chambers, capital punishment for otherwise minor offenses, even for children, and a people bred to hate and despise themselves. Truly sickening and eye-opening.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|For years I've tried to picture how &#34;the last battle&#34; could possibly be written...threads tied up, a grand battle instead of slow build up....and particularly in a single book. And now I know, and I think it was masterful. Sanderson did an amazing job. Sitting here on my couch, moments after finishing, I'm sure there are plot holes I missed, and ends left dangling. But I know I felt a gamut of satisfying emotions in the last few hours, and that's all I can ask of any book. Well done.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Had missed this movie. Thanks to prime, I could watch it from free. Loved it, absolutely. Will watch it again.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Very well done. Fun to watch and not over the top. Now one of my all time favorite movies .
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Awesome game for bronies everypony should play the graphics are good and you could justnimagine your self as a pony
B004UPANAI|3.0|The movie gives background on Wolverine and mutants. It is ok to watch but not as good as the X-Men movies.
0307352145|5.0|This book can be quite controversial.  Does this put people in a box?  People can be too much either way.  Some extroverts are so extroverted that they are always on stage.  Some introverts are are so introverted that they see little outside of themselves and their own world.  Some feel introverts are too selfish, too inward, not seeing or caring or having no interest outside of themselves.  Some people feel that extroverts are more fun, outgoing, always wanting to do things, to be involved with the world around them.<br /><br />I don't care about Al Gore, his politics, his philosopies.<br /><br />The chapter about cultures, Asians va American/Europeans is interesting.  Asians prefer people who are thoughtful, reserved, quiet and studious versus loud, outgoing, talkative people.  Asian students in U.S. are interested in school work, studies and getting good grades. A teacher's dream.  These kids have little interest in sports, so different from American kids.  Ms Cain was surprised in the difference between American and Canadian kids and Asian kids.  In Asian cultures Asian kids who are quiet and bookish are popular among their peers whil American kids prefer to have extroverted, outgoing kids as friends. These are considered much more fun.  Quiet kids are inclined to be looked down upon in American culture.  This thought and idea carry onto adult life.  Good students are encouraged by Asian parents.<br /><br />I firest heard of this book on Public Radio when Ms Cain was the speaker and talked about her book.  The book has an attractive cover, gray with Quiet in red and some words in white.  This book was a New York Times bestseller.<br /><br />Ms Cain writes about people in business, lawyers, those who need to be loud and aggressive.  However, she states soft spoken, quiet people can make their statements and be more competent at their jobs.  These are the deep thinkers who do not jump to conclusions.  They do as well or better that loud, boisterous folks.  Some introverts feel that extroverts talk too  much nonsense and like to hear the sound of their own voices.  Many extroverts feel that introverts are dull and boring.  Introverts tend to be interested in things that interest them, not everything in general.<br /><br />Surprisingly a very popular Harvard professor became an introvert.  Upon retiring from teaching he and his wife bought  aquietpiece of landin Canada where he tends to keep to himself or with very few people.<br /><br />There is much to think about, to argue about, to discuss.  And what is wrong with being either?  Some people are introverts at times, extrovert at others.  People change.  Nothing is set in stone.<br /><br />But I do get tired of people who talk, talk, talk about nothing.  Get this book and read it.  It has a lot of interesting facts.<br />Enjoyable and an easy read.
0062255657|5.0|One of Gaiman's best. Fantasy, mystery, real life and magic, all combined. I read it in one sitting... (Well, it is a bit short).
B000ZM7VVO|5.0|there is not a song that i dont like on the album i can put it in and play it over and over
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Dear Sir:<br /><br />Your work is astounding to me.  You speak simultaneously to the child and the grown man and the old, old man I might become some day.  I have just finished The Ocean at the End of the Lake and left it for a young lady who has just graduated from college and is going to become an artist.  Naturally I sent her (and offer it to the readers here) this youtube link of your address to a group of graduates from art school.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I started with American Gods.  Then the Sandman series.  Then the rest.  Now this work here.  Here's what you do for me in this current work - The Ocean at the End of the Lane:<br /><br />1.  You drop a pebble into a pond that radiates out and with each expanding ring the pond becomes larger - just like the ocean - larger even than an ocean.<br /><br />1a.  The pebble is the story, the pond is my small mind and the ocean is a larger sense of my existence, identity.<br /><br />2.  When I finished this book - as has happened in reading your other works - I realized that I was simultaneously smaller and larger than I was before.  Smaller in the sense of more humility and amazement at this large and vast world I am living  in; larger in the sense of my connection to and interdependence with the creative imagination.<br /><br />2a.  There is something about this work that roots me in the very real ground of reality and throws me out in the sea of inspiration.<br /><br />3.  I am still \\"taking you in\\" as I've just recently watched the link of your speech and it is very clear to me that the man speaking to those graduates is the very same man who wrote this book.  The story you have created and the YOU telling your own story about you are simultaneously different, similar and ultimately inseparable.<br /><br />3a.  You practice what you preach and you don't really preach but show through your example.  I think the commencement speech should be an added part of this particular work.<br /><br />I strongly, joyfully, and with a bit of a sad and tender heart recommend this work.<br /><br />Thank you, once again, Mr. Gaiman.

B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|I got my box set today and it's quality plus. Very extensive and better than my vinyl. Ed Santa Rosa, CA
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I downloaded the book from the list of free kindle books. Totally loved the first one. Very cute love story. I found out the book was the first book of the series. Ended up reading all the books of the series. I really loved the characters and got into the stories! def a nice lite summer read. I got caught up in the stories. Enjoy!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I've played other games from this publisher before, but this one was the best yet.  It kept me engaged for hours.
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|Loved reading about the experiences that shaped and molded one of the greatest authors of our time as well as learning about how he goes about the process.
B003IWRE3I|5.0|Want to know the definition and expectations of a real dad?  Watch this movie. He'd do anything for his kid...true paternal love.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|My only complaint about this DVD is that I wish it was longer. I could have watched two more hours of them talking about the music and playing together.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Kingdom Rush is an awesome game ,you'll be amazed by how fun it is. It works great<br />on my kindle fire
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|The transfer off all the films is top notch, but the 2nd and 4th installations have a sub par storyline and script.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|One of my favorite movies and songs.  I never get tired of listening to the songs. I love listening to the cast singing.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|One of the best movies ever! I can't stop watching it, it's so awesome. Deep & Del Toro are amazing!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Excellent, high quality, professional grade product. Does everything it claims to. Sleek, very well made product. I was/am VERY satisfied with this purchase.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This is one of my favorite series.  The story line is fast paced, interesting and it keeps you in anticipation for each episode.  You gotta love Vic and his team.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|I would recommend watching this with a younger child. It could be quite scary for younger children.  Good movie overall.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is somewhere i can be free it lets me be me which i love minecraft . I cant wait to get home from school and play the day away.
B0001MLMKY|4.0|Love the Swatch.  Simple, easy to read!  The day/date has a bit of a magnifier in the face of the watch so you can see the day/date better!  Which is very helpful.  It's a nice looking watch.  I just wish that Swatch would make a leather band (pass through) and an indigo night light , like the Timex Weekender series!  I have one of those too!  Highly recommend both the Swatch and the Timex Weekender!)
B007UR1OHO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie! It's funny too. I would have liked it better if they would have come to end in a different way (without a divorce).
B001PB3RU8|4.0|She has a beautiful voice which she takes in many directions. would love to hear her do a duet with Eddie Vedder
B00CE3IC74|5.0|I got these mostly on a whim to play around with but found them to be quite usefull. I initially set up the usual suspects (car mode, work mode, bedtime mode, etc) and then started pondering other uses. The ability to have the tag create a Calendar Event was probably the wildest suggestion as these would be great for a Wedding &#34;Save The Date&#34; card.<br /><br />As far as durability, so far they've worked perfect. The variety of colors makes them fun.<br /><br />I highly recommend these, especially paired with the free NFC Task Launcher (in the Google Play Store).
B00AYR2FQ6|3.0|Will have to check out other things by this artist. Reminds me of some other artists,maybe a combination of Dylan and....
B00CXG8Z1K|5.0|I love this collection of songs.  Enjoyable and relaxing to listen to.  Definitely had to add these songs to my MP3 player so I can listen anywhere.  Awesome!
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I have in the Past liked Kanye West's albums.<br />However, this album is terrible. It deserves ZERO stars.<br />I believe Mr. West owes me $11.50.<br /><br />Best lyrics ever?!? I think I missed it Mr West.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I had never played Mahjong because just from looking at someone else play it looked like a solitaire game because of the stacking tiles. I asked a friend and was told it was a basic 'matching game'.  I downloaded it and I've played it every day since.  Very relaxing..!
140006922X|5.0|Well, shucks. When I picked up this here book about the one true religion I was anxious to get started 'a reading. Then I read somewhere that the author is a fandangled Mooslem. Now he has a 'fancy degree' and 'commitment to the rigors of academic discipline' and 'exhaustive citations for his arguments', but he's a Mooslem, like I say.<br /><br />If you done be a patriot and a god fearin' man don't be fooled by people say you gotta think so hard about things n' valuate truth by the strength of the arguments being made. Thinkin hard's for if you don't know from your gut, and my gut's feelin' mighty sour, chief.<br /><br />The five star rating is it makes great kindling.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game is refreshingly different, easy to learn, and addictive!!! It really challenges your mind and requires visual reasoning skills along with a bit of trial and error. The goal is to paint your white ball to match the one on the box. It's tricky, but totally doable. I finished all 44 levels in a couple of hours. I wish it were longer but it's definitely worth downloading just for the unique brain workout! I'd love to play more games like this one where there is no timer and unlimited moves. Does anyone have suggestions for other games to try like this?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Its works prefectly!<br />Everything downloads very quickly!<br />Saves time and very fast to use!<br />Would recommend to everyone that don't have it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Is a great game for horse lovers, takes up a lot of money but very worth it ! Love this game!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I loved this book; totally creepy and dark but it sucks you in. I finished the book in two days.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B006LN8JJE The Last Moderate Muslim]], and a man who was born and raised in a multi-faith nation, Lebanon, I know  countless cultural nuances in applying the Christian and Islamic theologies.<br /><br />Zealot is purely academic and as fact-based as any scholar could produce. Having learned the theology and history of Islam, the biography of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, and read Zealot, some of my conclusions are reinforced, Jesus and Muhammad shared a holy calling to inject humanity in a region that was and continues to be paralyzed with strife.<br /><br />Incidentally and to a great extent, Zealot corroborates the understanding of Jesus by millions of moderate and rogue Muslims worldwide. I hope that those who read \\"rogue Muslims\\" internalize that to mean, 'Perhaps we have a lot in common to bridge the differences' in contrast to, 'If the rogue Muslims see it this way; therefore, we should condemn Zealot.'  Those whose reviews condemn the book, I trust match the latter for another more profound reason. Maybe they are jaundiced by Aslan saying and writing that Jesus was a man,not Lord, over and over.<br /><br />Drop your hearing weapons and give yourselves the privilege to learn more about Jesus Christ, whose story and actions made the world a better place.
0440246318|2.0|My husband is a big fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher  so gift giving is easy.  Just buy a new novel.
B008GJV2OA|5.0|A must see for anyone looking to relive the craziness of the cold war. I enjoyed it again as much as the first time I saw it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was chosen by someone in our Book Club.  There are a number of books selected by our group that do not keep my attention.  This one had me from the start,  I was interested in the main character and wanted her to succeed.  I was eager to experience her growth and was truly sad when it ended.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like the new look of the weather channel app. The only thing I miss is the swiping of the page to see the weather in my other saved places but do love the new look.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My hubby and I love to watch this show together! It reminds us a little of Boston Legal, which we also loved watching. Highly recommend!
0399226907|5.0|Great book!!!! Eric Carle is wonderful!!!! Great educational and science book for younger students.  My students and I enjoyed it.
0307352153|1.0|Too much of a research book. Not my kind of reading. The material is good. Didn't care for the book
B000024KZQ|5.0|I bought this item for a friend she loved it I chose this rating because it was everything I expected and more she really liked the cd  I would recommend this item to anyone who is a fan of Whitney Houston
B002DOSBMK|4.0|Amazing. Unlike any fantasy story of the Elvin world I have read. As soon as I turned the last page of Homeland, R.A. Salvatore's first installment in his Dark Elf series, I immediately rushed to my laptop to order the next books in the series!<br /><br />Check out the rest of my review: [...]
B00BQOC4X0|5.0|Stimulating, extremely informative, balanced and ultimately, frightening...<br />I recommend anyone to read it who wants a well thought out perspective on the current crises in human affairs.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|cute story with a positive ending. Maybe could still be good with less bathroom humor. Enjoyed watching with our grandchildren.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love the subway surfers game!  If you're a fan of temple run, you will love this game.  I like the fact that it is much simpler than temple run with no tilting you just have to swipe.  I do wish keys were easier to find.  It would be awesome if you could just buy keys and super mystery boxes.
B001X0ZKM4|5.0|I watched this movie with my ten year-old son and had a fun time.  It had some funny scenes along with action packed fun.  However, there are a few randy scenes that will need parental supervision and may I just suggest parents watch first then fast forward past those scenes.
034580404X|3.0|I am half-way the fence with the good reviews and bad reviews. Mostly, I prefer a well-written story when it comes to erotica.  As I've said in other reviews, reading GREY sent me back to the STORY OF O, the 1950s French novel that caused such a sensation.  And that led me to a new erotica book on kindle that I think is just sitting in cyberspace but it blew my mind. Now I'm on a one-woman mission to get it noticed by others.  It's so well-written, a real love story with images of vintage clothing (the protagonist owns a vintage clothing shop and dresses in vintage clothing for the sex scenes...there are colored photos of the clothes in the book...) [[ASIN:B00802VJS2 Life, Lust & Vintage Clothing]]I've been on a search to find out who REALLY wrote this since it's too polished to be \\"first-time novelist\\" as it says.  The photo of the novelist, Emmeline Jules, doesn't even look real, at least to MY eye. Is it real?? But my gosh, what a story!  I am still under 40 and appreciate erotica about women closer to my age, not a gangly, falling down college girl who bites her lip. No offense, please, to anyone who does love GREY.  But I just prfer a real woman, more grown and experienced, that's all, with solid writing.  So, while I'm waiting for \\"Emmeline Jules\\" to write a second erotica novel, I've been doing my best to find out who she (or HE??) might really be.  No luck so far but I'm on the case!  Enjoy the novel if you check it out.  Wear the clothing in your mind, as I did!
B00124PXW8|5.0|An enjoyable but still scary movie to watch after all these years.  I am from a generation that remembers this movie as one of the all time greatest scares, so it brought back a whole thriller feeling of being scared.  However, I would never recommend this movie to any parent to watch with a child or teen or even holding a bucket of popcorn in their lap.
B003YL4KS0|3.0|The info in this book is great, but Australian shops carry so few of the good hair products, and I can't find a stylist anywhere who can cut my hair.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Love Bonnie so cant go wrong with this great album. I recommend it. Cant say anymore words about it. ok
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|i liked it, and found it interesting and full of the sci fi thing. Good enough for me to watch.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I was hesitant to order another chimney starter after having purchased the weber standard size starter.  The standard starter is big and holds about 100 briquettes.  This is great if using a full size grill.  I however, travel with my 18\\" Weber and this compact starter is perfect and takes up much less room.  I also use it when I only need 10 or so briquettes for slow smoking.<br /><br />I haven't noticed the handle getting hot because I use gloves when handling these starters and I think everyone should to avoid burns.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />I added a photo so people can compare the size difference.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I thought this was very good, although somewhat disturbing, but not in a weird way. It is slightly predictable, though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Downloaded this for my kids and they cant have enough of it. I enjoyed it myself as well, we've watched the movies and that makes connection quite fantastic and exciting.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I don't generaly enjoy kids movies but this one was a hoot! It wasn't just a sloppy kiddy show, actually had a good story that kids and adults would like. The minions need more air time.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I am looking forward to Season 3!!! Many thanks to Amazon Prime for including season 1 & 2 in membership
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I've seen this film 4 or 5 times and each time I am brought to tears by what I see. You hear the phrase, mans inhumanity to man, and this gives a slight example. I don't think there is any way someone who did not actually live through this could understand but this movie helps a little.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|A hotdog has less artificial filler in it than this worthless novel.  I will not even bother with the next book and may not even bother reading another Sylvia Day novel.  Too bad I liked the first two books.  I don't like being tricked into buying a novel with no purpose, except to make money.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Now this was a neat twist on zombie flicks. I had no desire to see this but my wife convinced me to watch it with her and I gotta say it was much better than I thought it would be. Not often you see a romance/zombie flick.
B00C061I3K|3.0|The album is ok. It doesn't feel like the previous ones where I was floored by certain songs. Needs more robot voice!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I thought this was a pretty neat movie. Kind of saw a bit about Dorothy's future and things that lead up to when she actually went to Oz.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! I read it in 3 days. I could not put it down!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I've been a fan of Bruce Willis for along time and thought this was a great film for him as well as the others as they are not as young as they used to be. Good story, great action, and pretty funny.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Im 13 and i got this game bc it was free just for today. To tell the truth i would not pay for this game bc it doesnt have alot of levels and it goes by quickly. I do warn u though.. its VERY addictive. Its vert fun and gets you thinking. Its a very cute game. I would recommend it . It has no advertisements which is great bc they can be really annoying.<br /><br />***im really hoping they update it and make more levels it would be great***
B005OYKIJ0|5.0|Fast Five appears to be a very expensive action-packed Fast and Furious movie sequel.  There is practically<br />non-stop action with car chases and car wrecks in abundance. I liked it and am looking forward to Fast and Furious 6.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. In a way it's like Facebook. It's also great for young kids who like horses, because it teaches you how to take care of a horse and balance your money. It's really easy to figure out.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|The book swirled around me for more than 15 years. I would pick it up and get sidetracked with projects and work. I finally decided to give myself a treat this Summer and downloaded it using my KINDLE app. I found myself reading page after page, finished it ans then read Lois Lowry's Newberry Award speech afterwards. So, what was next? I read Gathering Blue, Messenger, and Son all within a week. At a ripe age of 51, The Giver helped me rediscover the joy in getting lost in a good story. Thank you Lois Lowry.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I heart heart heart heart this game! It's fantastic and a perfect sequel to Temple Run! And the best part is that it's free!
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|This was a wonderful book, well written and with an interesting theme, with a great mistery to be solved at the end. We keep reading and trying to guess what comes next all the time. But the thing that hooked me most was the brilliant description of love in all its forms. I cried a lot at the end, so prepare the tissues and read it far from your husband if he (like mine) gets scared with your tears. But don´t keep from reading this poignant story because of that, please, I promise it will be worth your tears. Good job, Ms. Morton!
1781162646|4.0|King is a master storyteller, and this little crime/ghost story is just plain fun. Anyone who has ever had a summer job at an amusement park will know that King sums it up perfectly. There is something magical about it that fades as soon as the seasons change.<br /><br />I recommend you take this book to the beach, the pool, or the patio with a cool drink on a warm summer night. It isn't a scary story, but it still has a thrill.
B00C5ZORES|3.0|This is the problem I've always personally had with listening to Fall Out Boy albums. I just don't like them, but I'll like a select few that happen to be EPIC.<br /><br />I liked how this album had a mix of pop elements. There was even dubstep in one song. Considering this, I don't know why the name of the album would be Save Rock and Roll (I think I'm missing something), but I'm not complaining. It didn't sound bad. I just didn't like most of the songs as a whole.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST FREE HORSE GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!  It is very realistic. The horse is very pretty it's name is Beauty. You can enter in competitions and train and take care of your horse.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|Now I have to see the second movie. Loved! The characters do a good job of being believable and lovable but also fierce. It's a movie, not real life and you feel that. It's neat.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|I love Sandra Bullock. This movie touches on reality, plus areas of funny and serious. I would recommend to all.
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|I was loving this series of tv shows and books until the tv series took the nudity/sex up to a whole new level! I mean, the book goes into some detail, however, it doesn't focus quite as intensely as the show does. This has become more a soft-porn than a tv series based on some very well written and intriguing books! It's a shame too, doesn't do the book any justice.
B00B5P37IG|2.0|Here's another one with hidden charges that you do not know about until you try to use it. I figured with the purchase of Prime there would be no hidden charges.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is a very good writer.  With his beautifully worded descriptions of the country and the characters, I felt wholly enmeshed in the story  as though I was among them following their paths.  I would definitely recommended this book and probably any book this man has written since this is the second one I read and truly enjoyed.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I really like the game. It challenges you but you feel you have a fair chance. Your not playing for 60 days without accomplishing a win, like some games.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|I am having a problem with the update, the games keeps telling me there's no update available while there is one,please help asap
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was a little hesitant on committing to watching this but I was talked into season 1 and started to like it. Season 3 is even better!!!
B000S1M9LY|5.0|I carried around, read & finished the big, huge trade-sized paperback version of IJ when it came out back in the 90's. Just downloaded the Kindle version of that & The Pale King. This book is indeed tough to slog thru initially with the dizzying number of characters & footnotes. The vast majority of novels I've read will never be revisited but IJ is a great book for re-reading, in small doses, just to savor DFW's writing style.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have been a fan of spider for quite some time. This version is well executed.<br />Very addictive and playable.
B00819ER0Q|4.0|Well written, well acted, provocative. Jim Carrey rarely does his wacky shtick, so it doesn't detract from the movie. Highly recommend. It was engaging the entire time.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I got this game for my child. when she first got it she had fun completing the missions. the she asked mommy it says stuff about need to be on facebook! this is a children's game and should not have to log on to facebook. do you realize how silly you would look having a children's movie turned into a game on facebook! there are no other ways to get friends either. my daughter still has fun with the game though...
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is awesome but it takes forever to have my kindle update it would be nice for it to update faster and better my friends all have the new stuff when they join my game it is so fun and I would play it all day if I could buy it or live in vain of never getting it this is a decision you will have to make do it the right way and download it. Who ever tells you it blows tell them u suck because this is the best game ever and let no one make fun of minecraft peace out<br /><br />Oh yeah minecraft rocks
B008GBCMHO|5.0|Who can't love the Aristocats? Disney always makes good movies. I would recommend this to anyone. My grandchildren pick it often as a bedtime movie.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I love despicable me exspesily the minions so when I saw this app I got it right away but it didn't work  big disappointment:(
B0060CXSR4|5.0|Can't get enough Disney; can always depend on a quality movie from Disney. Enjoyed the story line and the music.
B005LAIH2C|3.0|it was comical nice special effects, I love to see beautiful women fight, and the guy was cute too<br />would recommend
B007SGM084|5.0|A page turner that I couldn't put down.  The way the author writes draws you into the world of Mrs. Gray.  Looking forward to more from this author.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|For somw REASON when i become am admin on a new page it takes forever for it to pop up on my managers app idk why but usually it pops back up.
B006LSZECO|5.0|After I read the reviews I was like, \\"Okay yeah whatever...Could be good. Could be bad. I'll give it a try, nonetheless.  This book was WONDERFUL! I will confess, the beginning was kind of slow, but that's to be expected with many mystery novels.  I absolutely LOVED the format this book was written; that is, the various points of view.  If you enjoy a good mystery as much as I do, I think you'll enjoy this book.  Definitely different than anything I've picked up before.  I say, give it a shot!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is worth it. At first I was skeptical, but in the end I was glad I downloaded. Some people are stupid and just write the words though ...
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This authors novels are always very tense and once you start reading them you cant put them down.  This is the 7th I have read and each and every one of them has kept me totally spellbound until the end!
0486266885|4.0|Dr. Jekyll is a short, twisted look at the individual divided. It essentially examines human nature but provides no real answers. The good doctor is transformed into Mr. Hyde, who acts quite like the id uncontrolled. He is nasty, interested in himself and quite unlike his alter ego. Be careful which version you buy. I have the 306-page Penguin Classics version with Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde (which is only 75 pages or so), The Beach of Falesa (billed as uncensored) and The Ebb-Tide. Dr. Jekyll spawned over 123 film versions alone.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A hilarious review of the comedian's career development and then a look at the family! Her voice rings out throughout.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|I was kinda surprised at how much I liked this album.  It's amazing!  I love the sound of Selena's voice on it.  It has alot of dance music but who doesn't like some music with great energy
159463176X|1.0|What a stupid disjointed and disappointing book.<br />Too many characters that don't belong and no reason for them to be there .<br />Clearly wrote it for money and the fact he hasn't published for a while . Will not reading his novels again !
B009RH9FR6|2.0|It's very stiff to rotate and it stands up too upright instead of tilting back for better viewing. You have to leave it open while charging so dust gets all over the screen. When closing it, it will not stay closed even when laying on the lid so the Kindle stays on instead of shutting off. Did not realize this last part until I shut it this morning with the lights off and saw the glow of the screen. I wondered why the charge wasn't lasting as long as it should. Too late to return it or I would. I'm ordering the Amazon case for it. My husband has the 8.9\\" case and it's wonderful. Don't try to save a few bucks on Marware. I ended up wasting $20 in the long run.
159463176X|5.0|This book met my expectations!  Khaled Hosseini is a master at weaving a story together.  The story was beautifully written and kept me turning pages until the very end. He did a wonderful job showing how family ties really do bind us together - whether or not we realize it.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|If you like lots of different tile types in a Match 3 game, this one will please you.<br /><br />My only criticism is that some levels have so.many chained tiles that it takes<br />forever to finish the level.
B000ZJTPLG|5.0|What can I say? I can rock out to my heart's content now, without blasting my sweetie out of house and home! The sound is really awesome, and the convenience can't be beat! Now to see if they have one for my bass, too!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Excellent revenge flick with an over the top bloodbath, although the number of cameos were alittle too numerous. Enjoy the carnage!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I watched this knowing that I just wanted to see all these action stars in one movie with a lot of action and very little drama. That's exactly what I got. It was fun especially if you were looking out for each character's cliche line or move.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|When Enterprise was originally on, we couldn't access the channel (UPN). Now, thanks to Amazon Prime, we were able to watch the first season in it's entirety. I found the episodes in this season to focus on the characters and explore humanity through the eyes of sci-fi like the best of Star Trek does. Great series that comes recommended to any Star Trek fan.
B00DU74U74|1.0|I gave it one star because I do not know how to rate it 0 stars.  Do not waste your money!
B002VWOMN6|3.0|We lost our DVD copy so I replaced it with this Blu-ray version. I was shocked to find there were no chapters to jump to specific points in the movie. The extended director's cut is not a big win for me. Just the clarity of this remaster to bluray
B00C7LB20C|4.0|I was nice to see Aaron Eckhart again. he was believable in the roll. the only problem I had with it is...... are teenagers really that stupid? you will see what I mean if you watch it. a good solid thriller.
B005EHILV4|3.0|This is a nifty little item for quick PC hookup and a simple mic and/or line-level audio source. I don't think I'd try most condenser mics as the &#34;phantom power is a mere 12v--not 48v. After all, it is USB powered. So, take it for what it is.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I purchase Nemo's Reef game for my Kindle Fire.  It says it is downloaded, but when we go to play it says to go to the settings.  I don't see where the settings are.  If someone could help me I would be so grateful.  My two young grandsons were so excited and now are disappointed cause they can't play it.
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|I loved Ironman.<br />I loved Ironman 2.<br />I thought that I might like this too, but no.<br />I couldn't get through 30 minutes of this before I had to shut it off.<br />I felt like I started at the end of some long story, I couldn't tell you if there was even a plot to it. This movie couldn't hold my attention. And that's pretty bad because I sat through all of William Shatner's \\"The Captains\\" yesterday and didn't find it as boring as the first 30 minutes of this one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fantastic series, worth every minute of watching.  Started with Season 1 and watched all the way through the series and cannot wait for season 4.  Great characters, great writing and plotline that keeps you guessing.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|I loved the movie and the music. I listen to this album often. Cannot wait for the next movie and soundtrack.
B005V2S7FW|4.0|I would give this app 5 stars if it would only auto fill every web site. Some have to be entered manually.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I had never heard of Anker before I bought this USB hub, but am a fan now. The hub is well built, comes in a nicely designed package (no hard to cut plastic!) and worked great on my Macbook Air with 2 flash drives and an external hard drive all playing nicely. Worked great on my work Lenovo Thinkpad too!<br /><br />This should be a must for all Macbook Pro owners since there's tight space between the USB ports on the side. And for the price - you can't beat it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. My first Stephen King book and I was skeptical that I would like it. Fast read, despite the 800+ pages. Highly recommended.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I play it everyday. that is how much I like this game so much I have everything in the game
B002HFJ77S|4.0|I really enjoy reading Sophie Kinsella's books and this one was no exception. I had a bit of a hard time getting into this one at first, but I stuck it out a bit and was glad I did. Fun and sweet story with a happy ending.
B00007FOMP|5.0|If you read the lyrics to the songs of this album you will see ,the only thing that has changed is the date....great music from a true master....RIP ....BROTHER  MARVIN..
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|One of my husband's friends recommended this show to him so we decided to check it out. We were able to watch the first season on Netflix but the second season wasn't available yet, so I pre-ordered it on here. It came quickly once released and my husband and I also enjoyed this season as much as the first.
0545128285|5.0|This book is from the world of Harry Potter, but is a different collection of stories. There is commentary from series characters, and one story plays a part in the books, as does the entire book itself. It is fun to read stories that are the parallel in the wizarding world to the muggle Grimms' fairy tales.
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|I really enjoy Sophie Kinsella's fun and light style of writing, and this book was no exception. I enjoyed all of it and am glad to have read it. Fun read.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Non stop action with surprises in every scene showing good and bad choices made by the cops. Video quality was poor and it really shows on a 120 inch screen.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|I had never seen this movie and my husband mentioned wanting to watch it so I ordered it off of here because of the good price and quick shipping (Prime account). It was really good, but sad, and had some great acting. Love Tom and Denzel.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 continued the storyline and already has me eager for season 4!!!  The storyline is intriguing while keeping in line with the time period.  I cant wait!
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Awsome. paid for its self the first day I used. Cop hiding in the median shooting radar cruising at 85 warned with plenty of time to slow it down.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game because it really gets your mind kina thinking about where to drag the lines in the game.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|It's very fun, it has a good variety of dragons, but it would be more fun if a few dragons were a tiny bit easier to get,but still very fun!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|The game is good. Especially if you have friends online playing with u. So go add your friends and start having fun!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really like this Mahjong title, the star system gives an extra boost to playability, and trying to get three stars and really fast times on all the layouts is fun.
0689835604|5.0|Before naptime and bedtime, this is my daughter's go to book. As with any book with flaps, they can be ripped off; however, easily glued back in place for further enjoyment.<br />I've also given this book as a gift.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like the game, it's a pretty fun Temple Run type, but I have to keep resetting my Kindle Fire, because the graphics lag from time to time, making the game much less fun.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|There is nothing new or \\"researched\\" in this book. It is largely a selective rehashing of a variety of guesses made by other authors.
0395389496|5.0|We love reading this book during the holiday season. We love the illustrations because the pictures alone tell so much more about what is going on in the story. We have fun talking about what the other kids are thinking and the snow being so called and all of the elves, and the love of Santa Claus and the picture of the family under the Christmas tree. A great classic that we will never outgrow.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Awesome, awesome storyline, plots, characters, actors, and depictions. I love the Renaissance and studied it minutely throughout high school. When Anne Boleyn was given the Book by Cromwell, I almost cried. The music is absolutely gorgeous, there is one line that continually runs throughout the softer scenes that is beautiful. The only problem was the very racy levels the sexual scenes reached. Not wholesome for any person. I don't believe Anne was that lewd in leading King Henry on, either.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ive ever played...play it if you have not played it....U WILL LOVE IT spool.....PLAY IT
B002M9WW30|5.0|The first and last movies are the best, but they are all great. It is especially gratifying to see how many movies Stallone made, given that the first one was panned by the critics. Each movie has very touching moments and end with the fight. When you watch one each evening, like my husband and I did, it is interesting to see how Stallone ages, yet still in great shape.
145260617X|5.0|\\"...the basic Taoism that we are concerned with here is simply a particular way of appreciating, learning from, and working with whatever happens in everyday life. From the Taoist point of view, the natural result of this harmonious way of living is happiness.\\"<br /><br />There are some things that I've accepted that my brain is just not built to understand. Calculus and Economics are a couple of examples. But the one shining example is Philosophy. My freshman year of college I signed up for Philosophy 101 but I knew right from the start I was going to have difficulty. Most people would have stuck it out and studied super hard, but I? Timed it just right and booked it out of there when the teacher's back was turned to the class. Yes. I am a coward. So suffice it to say, Philosophy and I don't have a good track record. But if my Philosophy professor spoke of Philosophy (and maybe incorporated some Pooh-isms into his lecture) as Benjamin Hoff does in 'The Tao of Pooh' I think I would have lasted more than 10 minutes.<br /><br />'You'd be surprised how many people violate this simple principle every day of their lives and try to fit square pegs into round holes, ignoring the clear reality that Things Are As They Are.'<br /><br />The Tao of Pooh discusses many Taoist principals by relating them to the characters from Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh symbolizes the Taoist ideal of a still and calm mind and his ability to accomplish tasks \\"effortlessly\\" and is a true personification of the Taoist foundation. At heart 'The Tao of Pooh' manages to be a simplified and practical introduction into the ideals of Taoism and how to go about incorporating them into your daily lives in order to change things for the better.<br /><br />'You can't save time. You can only spend it, but you can spend it wisely or foolishly.'<br /><br />While I had already read this book years past, the narrator of this audiobook was perfection and truly made this book even more spectacular. I had the pleasure of listening to Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner on audio (narrated by Peter Dennis) and I must say that Simon Vance did an incredible job with the different voices of Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore and the rest of the gang from The Hundred Acre Wood. This production was nominated for an Audie in the Solo Narration--Male category and is in my opinion completely deserving of the nomination.<br /><br />'The wise know their limitations; the foolish do not.'<br /><br />While 'The Tao of Pooh' may not be the most profound study in Philosophy or Taoism, it makes it clear and concise and thoroughly enlightening.leasure of listening to Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner on audio (narrated by Peter Dennis) and I must say that Simon Vance did an incredible job with the different voices of Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore and the rest of the gang from The Hundred Acre Wood.

B000QFQE4U|5.0|Great film, great story. Something everyone needs to see in my opinion. Spike Lee and Denzel Washington are an awesome pair
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Awesome movie. Typical Tarantino, with sometime too much graphic blood. Greta story that keeps changing throughout until the end. Watched and then an hour later watched again.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Obviously an OCRed version of the original, but the typos aside, amazing reading.  I had never read the original stories, and I have found them as entertaining as Stephen King with quotable lines in every page.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This a money worth see several times, it is full of humor, life experience, and the reality of the end of life.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I find this serie to be more enjoyable than 50 Shades. The only reason I'm giving this book four stars, its because it was left very open ended. Didn't feel like it was concluded in any sense of the word. More like the end of a chapter, rather than a book ending. even if the author is continuing the series, it should not be left so inconclusive IMO. All in all, I love the story and can't wait for the next one. I say wait until the next book comes out, and read them together, maybe it won't feel as unfinished. As of right now I am still a fan though :)
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Grandkids love this as much as I enjoy do showing it to them. It does help them to know how to use app on phones too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Going to the local fair is not my favorite thing to do but playing the Coin Dozer game is... Now I don't have to wait!!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|So happy to find this great series; a more academic and humorous version of Tony Hillerman; also reminiscent of Lee Childs.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love this movie. It is perfect for children and for a family. It is cute, hilarious, & fun! I recommend it for all!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I can only say that this book was OK. The writing was good, but the story was a little ridiculous. Sorry.

B00AYBU7TE|5.0|This has the best version of Bridge over Troubled Water I've ever heard.  Cash tears your heart out.  Buy it.
630469878X|5.0|I like Susan Sarandon and that's why I purchased this movie. I enjoyed it and the price and quality were good.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Quick, interesting read. I enjoyed it, but wish there was a little more in depth on some of the aspects of the plot and characters. Overall very good. I would definitely recommend it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A poignant story of togetherness and absence, joy and heartache, hope and despair woven seamlessly through time, space and the agony of life's choices.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I enjoy family friendly movies...and this fits the bill. In today's society it is hard to find a movie where all ages can watch without fear of what people call &#34;normal&#34; today...
B005XLN97M|2.0|I think there were very little accessories in the package for the price paid. The look is good and it stays well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Outstanding series ... not a good ending though :-(<br /><br /> I am wondering what is to become of Mary and the baby ... cant wait for season 4 to find out :-))
B009KS4XRO|3.0|They keep changing things...it's supposed to be FUN but try make it too hard. After a while I just gave up with the tournament.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for season 4!  Watching Downton Abby is my late-night treat when everyone else is in bed.  Who would've guessed the ending?
B0093BUWGE|3.0|Saw Jose on Letterman awhile back and really liked him and his band playing \\"Trouble\\" from this recording. Sadly the rest of the material is forgettable and way too many \\"D'Angelo\\" slow grooves for my taste. The production is bass/ drum heavy to a fault. It sounds like the rhythm tracks for a hip-hop record not jazz. There is one extended solo from other band members and no liner notes other than featured artists. This guy is on Blue Note, but apparently the company is trying to distance themselves from their jazz tradition. I really wanted this CD to shine but it barely shimmers. Producer,Pino Palladino should know better especially with his long history is the music biz.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a great read because of the vast detail and a great storyline. The book has wonderful characters that you will get to know and love. I believe that this book had a lot of great moments. This made the book into a story that will be hard to forget. I couldn't put it down after I started! I hope the movie will be as good as the book!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love the Percy Jackson books and The Heroes of Olympus so I was really excited when they merged both of the series' into one book. I love the tragic relationship between Percy and Annabeth and the blooming love between Jason and Piper. If you do not know what I am talking about I suggest you read the other two series'. Buy this book after you are done reading those.<br />Note to Parents: This book contains kissing, mild violence and a few gory scenes.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|like all of Angry birds lots of fun to play. would suggest it to friends. I like Angry bird games
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Very entertaining; great retribution story; completely unbelievable. Had to shield my eyes when they unchained the dogs. Very much enjoyed this film.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Best weather app I have seen, I would give more stars if I could'. It works as it should and its also pleasing to the eyes
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is okay in the beginning with a few action moments here and there. It is mostly filled with romance and drama. But when they get into the arena it is action. I give applause to the author for being a genius when writing this. I have even more questions at the end of this book then I did when i read the first . This book leaves me wondering about the future of Katniss Everdeen (if they is one). I am sad there is only one book left because I don't want the series to end. I have not read many books but I know that this book is my favorite. Thank you Suzanne Collins for showing me world in the eye of Katniss Everdeen! XD
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is fun and lately has been taking up all of my time. The only problem is how hard it is to get more gems
0345803485|5.0|If you choose to read this book, please keep in mind that it's truly about \\"love\\". Ana Steele is a really sweet & INNOCENT young lady who tries desperately to SAVE the man she's fallen hopelessly in love with. Christian Grey isn't cruel but a tortured soul and damaged from his experiences in life. He needs saving and I think he's worth saving. Their relationship is a \\"first time experience\\" for BOTH of them. This is an extremely COMPLICATED journey where two people (who share an EXPLOSIVE attraction to each other) end up falling in love and attempt to co-exist romantically in two different sexually oriented lifestyle preferences. There is a good bit of emphasis on contracts and the main characters are quite analytical so my reader dictionary came in handy a few times. I knew nothing about bondage prior to reading this book but it was an interesting topic because this lifestyle exists and I believe this situation probably occurs often.<br /><br />E.L. James has said how much she liked how Stephenie Myers wrote the Twilight books from Bella's point of view so she decided to write a book the same way. James spent tons of hours on research and has taken a lot of abuse about her lusty novels but she stresses that in the end it's all about \\"love & romance\\" and after having read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", I completely agree with her. This book is nicely written and flows quickly & easily from one chapter to another without a bunch of unnecessary words clogging it up just to increase the page count. She didn't waste my time like a lot of other authors have in the past. I had to stop once while reading it and I couldn't wait to get back to it. I am about to begin reading the 2nd book in the series, \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" now.<br /><br />WARNING: If YOU are offended by explicit sex ----- DON'T READ THE BOOKS & DON'T WATCH THE MOVIES but leave James alone! If YOU have NOT experienced SERIOUS lust & attraction I doubt you'll be very sympathetic to Ana's heart wrenching delemma. I don't think you'll enjoy this book IF YOU DON'T \\"LIKE\\" SEX so choose a different book or movie.on't think you'll enjoy this book IF YOU DON'T \\"LIKE\\" SEX so choose a different book or movie.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|its a great game its just that the driver in the game is a little flimsy and they should fix that.

B000R4SMD6|5.0|Anthony Hopkins is my favorite actor, and he was great in this movie. Every actor in this movie was fantastic.
B000I0XBOY|5.0|A very delicate movie with a lot of going on between the lines of visible art and unvisible art.<br />Indeed, there is also a lot of an invisible art present.<br /><br />What is life?<br />What is reality?<br />What is the border between the real and unreal?<br /><br />Those are the main issues covered brilliantly and in a very slow manner by the true master of cinema- Michael Angelo Antonioni.
B0091REZMW|1.0|This product is boring and repetitive. Most hidden object games at least give you different objects to search for when entering the same room over and over. Do not want a game where it depends on Facebook and or Twitter. Overall really disappointed!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This is currently my favorite series on tv.  It needs more promotion as I just stumbled on it and hadn't seen any promotion on it.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Its great to see this book its super great for the first time I'm going to read it more often today and tomorrow morning and  night I love this book its super great for me thaks

B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Hey, peeps! I love this game. It is like the first free app of the day the I actually enjoyed. ( 2 stars ) Really, really, SUPER really fun. ( 2 stars ) Doesn't have enough levels. ( -1 star ) :) Please say I am helpful. Really fun app. You should totally get it.
2070360024|4.0|Haven't quite finished the book yet. I need to put more time into reading. Too many words I'm not sure of, no fault of the author.  A good read, a rather famous book.
B003K15IF8|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this. You feel sorry for Stoner while wanting to tell him to take decisive action. Could see Stoner's characteristics in people
B00DU73T08|2.0|It was fine until the best friend of the host human chick's boyfriend fell desperately in love with the extraterrestrial parasite within her. Should the extraterrestrial parasite use the body of the girl to consummate its lust for the best friend of the girl's boyfriend?, or should it keep it together and respect the girl's body?... What a predicament!!! Oh my Gosh!!! They ultimately solved the problem by finding a throw away body of another chick which they patched up and implanted with the parasite... The movie would have been ok without this cheesy mind bending twist.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|I hate movies that are filmed in such low light you can't get any idea of what's going on. The content was ok but it would be nice to not be looking at a black screen most of the time.
B009NQZVKG|2.0|\\"The Eye of God\\" is James Rollins' most recent entry in his fantastically successful and (mostly) enjoyable Sigma Force series, about a team of DARPA funded Black Ops characters that jet around the world saving it and us time and again from various \\"end of the world as we know it\\" disaster scenarios.  I have read all of these, describing one of them (The Judas Strain) in a review as \\"a guilty pleasure\\".  All of the novels are formulaic, with our intrepid heroes and heroines getting into and out of inescapably deadly situations. Most of the core characters, agent Gray Pierce, Director Painter Crow, oversized demolitions expert Kowalski, Monk and so on each have distinct voices and personalities. The writing is tight, the pacing is fast, and again, both are highly formulaic.<br /><br />But I think with The Eye of God Rollins may have finally reached the end of Sigma Force, at least for me. I found myself constantly distracted while reading this one rather than enthralled.  The main Macguffin is that there is a comet approaching Earth that for some unexplained (and highly impossible reason) is emitting vast amounts of \\"dark energy\\" that is causing a warping of the space-time continuum around itself, much like a black hole might do.  Sigma Force somehow receives a time traveling message from 4 days in the future showing the East Coast of the US in smoldering ruins.<br /><br />Then there is some more (actually quite a bit more) pseudo-science about quantum entanglement of the comet's dark energy with an ancient relic fashioned from a millenniums old meteorite and cancelling out of \\"opposing\\" dark energy fields attracting one to ah.., uh..??.... well this is around the time that I figured that Rollins had really jumped the shark with this one.  The science here was clearly beyond him and that completely ruined the story for me. Even before the very disturbing coda to the tale.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the previous Sigma Force novels, all of which (except The Doomsday Key I found pretty interesting), and you don't know (or care) too much about physics and cosmology, you might like this one too.

051755075X|5.0|This is a great book and a classic.  So is the cover, if it exists, and I am frustrated at Google and many listings of this book for not describing existence or condition of the dust cover so I can find a replacement for my original.<br />AND, there is no place to submit a question to the vendor (like eBay) to ask questions about features like that.
B008ODZEQ0|3.0|A good example of the Japanese work ethic embraced by older Japanese.  Not so sure that a whole movie needed to be made from this one example though.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered the Chromecast the day it was announced and received it yesterday.  I was fortunately enough to have a TV with an open HDMI port with a USB port nearby for power.  I was worried that it might block access to the second HDMI port, but there was just enough room.<br /><br />Setup was a breeze and I didn't have any hick-ups.  I used a Nexus 7 tablet to control the Chromecast and it was quite easy to watch Netflix with the Chromecast.  I also displayed a video from Comedy Central's website using Chrome on a desktop machine and it played very well over the Chromecast.<br /><br />My only complaint it that the power-on light on the device remained on when the TV was turned off, and was quite bright.  As this was in my bedroom, I had to unplug the USB power cord to get to sleep.  I'll probably just cover the light with some black tape.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|I felt the author employed sufficient science along with a good plot to keep me interested from front to back. Unfortunately I did not read the 2 previous books in the series which I would rate as EXCELLENT. Scalzi's development of aliens and their interactions with humans is a highlight of the novel.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This forced update has ruined what used to be an awesome app. It's gone from an informative go-to for weather info to a cumbersome pain to deal with. No longer is it a way to get a quick accurate weather update. Rather, it looks like a child designed the graphics, gone are the helpful hourly weather conditions (as are the easily identifiable severe weather warnings and allergy condition alerts), and the maps are useless. Definitely gonna delete and find another weather app!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game!  great graphics, very addictive!  would suggest this game for anyone.  and the best thing is it free!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show!<br /><br />Hoping it wins many Emmys this year and has many more seasons.<br /><br />It is quality tv, quality acting and quality filming.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2BM5ILLSPSKWR]]This is a beautiful product for anyone who travels or works long days. You can charge your smart phone while on the bus, train, and plane or in a meeting without looking for one of those hard to find wall plugs. This powerful battery pack can charge your smart phone multiple times or extend the use of your smart tablet. (Please see the details listed below in my test results)<br /><br />It is beautifully designed, extremely thin, small and portable. This is a Lithium Polymer battery cell and it uses a Grade A power cell which will provide years of recharging capability, up to 500 plus times. The battery pack has the power storage of 6000 mAh. It has a standard USB port and a built in Micro USB cable (3.2 inches long) that can both output 5VDC at 1 AMP each, simultaneously. It can charge two devices at the same time. My testing reveals that this battery pack is powerful and effective with the capability of outputting 4813.36 mAh of its charging capacity which is 80.2 percent of its rated capacity which is an excellent result.<br /><br />What I like is that the unit is priced well and it is so small and portable but can really carry a lot of power. It easily fits into your purse, briefcase or pocket. Since it is only 0.47 inches thick (12 mm) it can easily slip into a jacket pocket for easy access. You could recharge most smart phones over 3 times with this power cell. The battery pack is about the same size as an iPhone 4. It weighs in at 5 3/8 ounces and it has a matte finish that helps you to grip it and it does not show fingerprints. I have included a video of this review and I hope it is helpful to you.<br /><br />When I test a battery I do an extensive set of tests that fully charges the battery and then I use it to charge devices and make sure that it is fully depleted when my tests are done. I time each test and document the results as the test progresses. I then calculate the mAh of capacity that the battery supplied and I then calculate its charging efficiency. This process takes from 3 hours to, in very large batteries, about a day for testing. I don't take any short cuts or guess and every battery has these tests performed on it and documented. This is to assure that the battery is tested and it performs well. If a battery has performed poorly I then run the tests again to verify the results.<br /><br />What's in the box?<br />* The Anker 6000 mAh black battery pack<br />* The battery pack comes with an instruction manual<br />* The battery does not come with an AC wall charger.  Use the Micro USB charging cable that comes separate with the unit for charging the battery.  You can use a computer USB 2.0 port to charge the battery pack but it is 6000 mAh and it will take between 10 to 12 hours.  The manual states to use a 1 Amp USB wall charger and it will take 5 to 6 hours but I recommend using a 2.1 amp AC wall charger if you have one.<br />* One charging cable for the battery pack or your smart devices. It is 12.3 inches long.<br />* An Apple 30 pin connector adapter.<br /><br />Anker® Astro Slim3 6000mAh:<br />* Powerful 6000 mAh capacity<br />* The unit is compact and weighs in at 5 3/8 ounces.<br />* Very attractive design, which is thin, small and lightweight.<br />* It has 4 LED status lights located on the front that indicate the battery charge level.  When you unplug the stored micro USB cable the LEDs will come on.  One flashing LED means less than 25%.  One LED on and one flashing means 25 to 49%, two LEDs on and the third blinking means 50 to 74%, three LEDs on and the fourth blinking means 75 to 99% and all four on means 100%.<br />* When charging a device the LEDs stay lit showing the amount of power still stored in the battery pack.<br />* The battery pack has a nice matte surface that is attractive and does not show fingerprints.<br />* There are two power outputs and one is a USB port and it is rated at 5 VDC at 1.0 Amp and the other is a built-in Micro USB cable that is 3.2 inches long and rated at 5 VDC at 1 Amp.<br />* You can charge two devices at the same time.<br />* The battery pack has an automatic on feature to start the charging process for your device and it will automatically shut off when your device is fully charged.  It is ideal to unplug your device when done charging to protect the long term life of the battery pack and your device's battery.<br />* Uses Lithium-Polymer battery technology.<br />* The battery pack can be recharged 500+ times<br />* Warranty is 18 months<br />* The unit is powerful and it has an attractive price.<br />* It is thin enough to fit into a shirt pocket, purse or into a jacket pocket at .472 inches thick (12 mm)!

B008Y6WMEY|5.0|All the actors in this period piece relative to the Cold War are up to speed with face and body movements and the dialog is especially well done. Seeing Peter Sellers in three different roles was a pleasurable experience. If you want to see what scared the hell out of everybody in the mid-sixties then watch this film.
0679731725|4.0|The Remains of the Day is not for everyone.  It is a thoughtful and insightful study of personality, class and culture that could easily be dull and depressing if it were not for Mr. Ishiguro's masterful writing skills.  Its narrator, Stevens, runs the house of Lord Darlington, a member of England's aristocracy.  Mr. Stevens is an effective and dedicated butler who is unbelievably fastidious and reserved.  He is loyal to a fault.<br /><br />The story is set in England during the mid-1950s, although much of the book recounts the period leading up to the Second World War.  At the beginning of our story, Darlington Hall has been bought by an American who encourages Stevens to take a little vacation.  Stevens hopes to use the trip to recruit a former housekeeper, Miss Kenton, to return to her old position.  As he travels, Stevens recounts his years of service with Lord Darlington, his kind-hearted former master.  In his rather proper way, Stevens tells us of his role in the workings of this great house.  Told with the narrator's emotionless formality, the story is dryly funny and laced with ironic meaning. For example, Stevens proclaims the English countryside to be the most deeply satisfying in the world, rejecting \\"exciting\\" places in Africa and America as \\"inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness.''  Stevens spends much of his time traveling obsessing on what makes a great butler.  The key, he confidently asserts, is dignity.<br /><br />Hints at larger issues are strewn throughout, slowly and carefully woven together.  We are slowly shown the flaws in Lord Darlington.  Hindsight has made the butler begin to question some of his choices.  In a pattern of progressive and ironic revelations, the author masterfully tells the story of regret.  More and more we learn of the price Stevens has paid for his loyal service and his dream of serving a gentleman of international renown.  He is so caught up in his own dream that he keeps trying to cover up Lord Darlington's flaws.  We begin to sense that his relationship with Miss Kenton might have gone somewhere had it not been for his devotion to his job.  He has sublimated his own wants and desires to his responsibility.  He has been cut off from intimacy, companionship, and understanding.<br /><br />Uniquely original, the novel is powerful and haunting, and beautifully told.  Mr. Ishiguro's ability to carve characters from their flaws is amazing.  He carefully explores how Stevens comes to terms with his decisions.  On the one hand, he tries to be honest; on the other hand, he tries to preserve a sense of dignity and self-respect.  We are reminded of those muffled places in our hearts that we all try to ignore.ngton's flaws.

B00846REIS|5.0|When I first attempted to read Sylvia Day's book, Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel, I thought it was a take off of Fifty Shades of Gray--a novel I fell in love with and I could not stop reading, however, I soon learned that there was little similarities in the two books.<br /><br /> I bought  Day's books and I read a few chapters but could not bring myself to finish reading Bared to You. I wrote a few of my novellas in between, and then I picked up Bared to You again.<br /><br />I was amazed at how I was able to connect with the characters when I kept an open mind about the differences in the books.<br /><br />Bared to You is one of the most engrossing books I have read. I could not put it down once I got into it and realized that it was completely different from Fifty Shades of Gray. I felt that I did not give it a chance because I was so caught up in E. L. James characters that I did not want to invest my emotions in Sylvia Day's Gideon Cross and Ava. Nevertheless, these characters and story lines are completely different and Day's writing of dialogue is clear, emotional, and engrossing.<br /><br />There are so many plots and twist to the characters' story that I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what will happen next.<br /><br />The sex scenes are many but they are written as if you are experiencing them for the first time. Her use of sex and dialogue to express the feelings of the characters create a mind movie that no feature length move or sex tape can capture for this price. The first book maybe a tad slow, but Day's second book: Reflected in You is the best in the series. Read it first and you will go back and read the first and last book and look for more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm giving a review to complete a quest and get free stuff from the game. Good game to kill time. I recommend this game for anyone.
0446555002|5.0|Once more the storyline is excellent, keeps you in suspense, and sometimes you even have to gasp when someone or something unexpected happens.  Fans will love this one as usual.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Was well written and kept me captivated from page to page.  This is a must read.  Can't wait for the movie!!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|not really the best book I've read but it gets way better in the end. It is really good for summer reading.
140006922X|1.0|No footnotes so it's impossible to tell Aslan's opinion from what he's actually researched. Doesn't understand that linen was the cloth of the powerful and wool, which could be spun directly from sheep, was the clothing of the poor. Complete and utter crap.
B0030BOCKK|1.0|This is nothing like H.I.M.'s other albums, and I own all of them up to this one. I got this as a gift and was excited to hear the new album, but was disappointed that the style had dramatically changed. I gave it a couple of honest listens, but none of the songs stuck with me. It sounds like a rushed Pop album. The lyrics are shallow and the melodies aren't anywhere near the quality of any of the other music they've produced. Not satisfied at all with this album. The art is pretty strange as well.<br /><br />I've been a H.I.M. fan since 2005, and they are still my all-time favorite band out of any genre. There wasn't a H.I.M. song that I disliked before this. But this album will never be played by me again. It's a huge disappointment. I just don't like any part of it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I would recommend this movie and it very funny and cute.  It never gets old to watch again and again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really cool game my kids love it and so do I.You have to get this game. Five Stars!
1881273377|2.0|I was reading the book and its spot on! But my husband isn't a reader... So I ordered the cd for him to listen to because this can't be a one way thing...<br />I was going to get the cd's and convert them to mp3 and then my husband would listen...<br />The cd narrator has such a southern accent... I couldn't get past it- and I'm sure my husband isn't going to listen to it.

B0058SNI94|3.0|The quality is as usual, I am a fan of Cocs, but because they only sell in whole sizes the shoe was too big:(
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Funny that this movie created so many years ago still resonates.<br />I wanted this version to have both the directors cut as well as the theatrical release with the talk track in it.<br />My boys needed to watch that one first to &#34;get&#34; the movie better.<br />I myself watch the directors cut.<br />For the price you just can't go wrong!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I have read the three books of the Clifton Chronicles and many more (Kane and Abel, Prisoners of Birth, Sons of Fortune, Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, etc) and I enjoyed all of them. This is by far the best of all of them. Can't wait for the next installment of the Clifton Chronicles. Buy and read them by starting at the beginning and it will be worth your while. Kudos to my favorite author!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Good as an Ap of the Day.  Fun and cute.  THe levels progress pretty quickly and if I'm tired I can't figure these out.  Once I'm rested it goes much better.  Probably a little difficult for younger kids.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun!  The puzzles are challenging, but not overwhelming.  I like the mixture of colors numbers and the various locations of the clues.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great film from beginning to end. Loads of action with the battle of New York scene as the highlight of the film. By far one of the greatest super heroe films ever made and looking forward to the sequel.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|This starts where the first installment of the Clifton Chronicles left off. It was like becoming reaquinted with the characters we had come to know. The ending was certainly a cliff hanger and I am looking forward to the 3rd installment.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I can not figure out level 17 this game is really tricky but well worth it I love it and kids loveit to
B004HWT6DO|3.0|This movie is well made but definitely shows the worst side of human nature and portrays the founder of Facebook as someone you might not want to have on your friends list ! Overall it is well made and acted, but definitely not a feel-good movie.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|I enjoyed all the episodes. I like taking a break from all the real world problems by watching this show.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|This album is amazing!!! I can not stop listening to it, it's addicting! Best album ever made out of the three!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|While I thought Feast had a very slow middle, this book kept me on pins and needles the whole way through!

0446554995|5.0|I've been reading Preston and Child from the beginning and loved the history they've building with Agent Pendergast and company. This one reveals a few things, introduces new elements sure to appear in future volumes, and winds up the loose Helen trilogy.<br /><br />Some reviewers complain about the two subplots that have only tenuous connections to Pendergast while the main story line goes on. I see their point, but as a long time fan of the authors' work, I had no problems with it. New readers might be thrown though. I will admit that.<br /><br />Still it rates five stars with me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this all the time on my kindle fire HD and I love it I'm on 0.7.1  right now although there is no Redstone it is still awsome
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|Not my cup o tea.  I like nature shows and thrillers, but this one was clumsy. Muddled Message I think.<br /><br />IMHO, view if you have nothing else in the library.
B002P4JKFA|4.0|The video is really good quality. The one drawback is that the soundtrack for the tunes just blasts out at a volume well beyond that of the dialogue. But since the music is what this is about, I must say that the quality of those tunes in 5.1 surround is just extraordinary. I've never heard better versions of &#34;If I fell&#34; and &#34;And I love her.&#34;<br /><br />All in all, two thumbs up.
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|This season is the finale of the Merlin series so I would definitely recommend that fans of the series see it. I would, however, also warn them of this: this season is often convoluted, contradictory, and humorless. This season lost most of the classic humor that made the earlier Merlin seasons so enjoyable. Quite frankly, it was rare to find a decent joke spaced less than 10 minutes apart from the other.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br />The entire plot of this series was tossed aside. King Authur was supposed to unite the lands and allow magic in Camelot. He did neither of these things (he made uneasy alliances with the other kingdoms, but the alliances were very frail- and that's putting it nicely- so I hardly consider that uniting the land).<br />*SPOILER*<br /><br />So those are my main complaints with it. But it still does have many perks. It has phenomenal acting by most of its cast. Its music is excellent. And, well, it does complete the series (even if not as well as it could or should have).
157421327X|3.0|I bought this one, as i am learninf Zentangle. This one is good but a bit on the thin side. I was hoping for a bit more but for what there is in content it was quite good.<br /><br />Paige
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I highly recommend season 3 for Downton fans!  It is the best so far and is Full of intrigue and drama.
B004KPX4W2|2.0|I couldn't really get in to the storyline.  There were some cool action scenes, but even though I'm getting a bit older now, I couldn't get in to the idea of a bunch of bad-ass retirees.  This just didn't seem novel enough to me to carry the humor or storyline through.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cool game I miss my real horse this is some good entertainment! :) I will be telling all my friends about this totally fun game thank you for making it
B001UV4XIS|3.0|The sound effects, scenery and acting are great.  I just wish movie makers would stick more closely to the book.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Bruce Willis never disappoints! Once again the latest in the &#34;Die Hard&#34; tradition, &#34;A Good Day To Die&#34; is very exciting entertainment worth the time & money. Highly recommended to Bruce Willis/Die Hard fans.

B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I played this and it's sequel, in their entirety, on the pc and it was fantastic!<br /><br />At its core it is a basic resource management game, but it's soexcellently done with so much more depth than just that, it's most definitely well worth your time. And for free?  REALLY??<br /><br />Stop reading this and start downloading!  You'll be glad you did!

B007MB5OCE|4.0|Enjoyed the story, style of writing and the story pace. Good summer read with much humor. Hope there is more like this one
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game rocks 1st off great graphics 2nd the gameplay really great. There are two types of game multiplayer and campaign. Downsides are that there are little glitches and there is no jump button please add this in next update but besides that great game good job gameloft.
B00BX8PG4S|4.0|As far as I know, this was a straight-to-video movie.  I rented this and \\"Assault on Wall Street\\" at the same time.  The comparison was remarkable.  Phantom was a well-acted and directed video.  It drew me in and kept me involved.  I enjoyed the Actor's performances, the plot was believable, even though much of it was reminiscent of other movies that came before.<br /><br />I would have paid to see this at the theater and been fine with it.<br /><br />\\"Assault on Wall Street\\" was a waste of money.<br /><br />But I'm talking about Phantom.  Definitely not a high $$ production, but very good.
0547569653|5.0|I will never be an ultramarathon champion, but I am inspired by stories of people who overcome challenges. I loaned the book to a friend as soon as I finished it - a sign that I really liked it!  I've tried a couple of the recipes, which were tasty as well as good for me.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|I have watched, with interest, other folks play these sorts of games, so I thought maybe it was time for me to try one out. This was the wrong choice. Instructions are sketchy, and I was lost in the first room! I may try another one, just in the case this was an unusual experience. But, I may stick to other forms of entertainment.
B0027DHAR4|5.0|This is the classic CD that most people associate with classic greenday. A must to any music fan who loves 90s and early 2000s pop music.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The old version I would have given four stars.  The new version has more annoying ads and 'prizes' and isn't as nice to use.
1589944607|5.0|After reading the reviews I thought this game would be incredibly complex and take hours to play through the first time. I was wrong. The first play through only took about 3 hours. We had thought it would take far longer, but we all read the manual before we met to play. The description talks about how it's a game of suspicion and tension, and that could not be more right. On the very first turn we were screaming at each other and were 100% positive that one of us was a cylon ( none of us were.) Two of the three of us were in the brig by the end of the 10th round of play or so. The tension remained high the entire game, which ended up being very close for both the cylon side and the humans. I can see why this was listed as one of the top rated boardgames of all time.<br /><br />On a different note, I noticed that the box cover in the graphic for this game is in French. I was a bit worried we were going to get the French version. Let me 100% confirm that this is not the French version, but the English version. Amazon should probably update that.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|The entire franchise speaks for itself.  My second-favorite incarnation of the series.  Just wish Amazon had all seasons in HD.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|This book raises an important topic and provides great research to support it. In some cases, the writing is tangential and too reliant on anecdote and personal experiences. However, at the end of the day it is 100% better to have the discussion raised and promoted than to keep the status quo as is. Heartfelt thanks.

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|With a six year gap separating Queens Of The Stone Age's last album from their latest, it goes without saying that expectations have been set about as high as they can get. As one of the few true, blue rock n' roll outfits to emerge in the 2000s, Josh Homme and his gang of collaborators have made a name for themselves by steering their own course, avoiding any and all trends at whatever cost. That cost, it seems, has been that every album released since 2002's highly successful \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" has been met with apathy from the general public who made the mistake of expecting the band to record the same album over and over again. But as anyone who gave \\"Era Vulgaris\\" or \\"Lullabies To Paralyze\\" a fair chance can attest to, Queens never lost it, and true to form, \\"...Like Clockwork\\" finds the band slipping into the groove with considerable ease, sounding entirely refreshed and reinvigorated. It's almost like they never went away.<br /><br />Fans of the band's earlier work will find the album to be a homecoming of sorts. Not only does \\"...Like Clockwork\\" reunite Homme with \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" drummer and fellow Crooked Vulture Dave Grohl (who plays on the bulk of the album), but it also brings Nick Oliveri back into the fold. The troubled bassist who played on \\"Rated R\\" and the aforementioned \\"Songs\\" only to find himself booted from the band in 2004 when the water got too hot provides backing vocals on two tracks (\\"If I Had A Tail\\" and \\"Fairweather Friends\\") which incidentally feature contributions from on-and-off collaborator Mark Lanegan. What more could you want? Trent Reznor, you say? Sure. Elton John, maybe? Definitely! The sm&ouml;rgåsbord of \\"Fairweather Friends\\" crams all of the usual suspects and then some into a single track that nearly bursts at the seams and pays tribute to the band's storied past and present.<br /><br />Fans of \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" will find cuts such as \\"If I Had A Tail\\" and the surf-rocker \\"I Sat By The Ocean\\" to be familiar territory, but it's where Homme really steps out of the comfort zone that the album really comes to life. \\"The Vampyre Of Time And Memory\\" finds the frontman crooning amidst a psychedelic backdrop that sounds more like something from the '60s than it does '90s stoner-rock. Homme himself suffered a setback when a surgery-gone-wrong in 2010left him bedridden for months at a time. Documenting his experience on \\"Vampyre,\\" Homme sounds vulnerable and human in a way that he has never before expressed. Likewise, \\"I Appear Missing\\" and the closing title track are at times haunting and touching, only furthering the multi-faceted nature of the band. It's quite apparent that \\"...Like Clockwork\\" is as much about Queens regaining their footing as it is about Homme confronting his inner demons. Granted, the album probably isn't the supposed return-to-form some might have been expecting, but what it delivers instead is a peak behind the curtain of a modern-rock legend while offering the sort of heart and soul that is severely lacking in today's modern rock scene. Keep your ears peeled, your mind open and enjoy the show.ry, but it's where Homme really steps out of the comfort zone that the album really comes to life. \\"The Vampyre Of Time And Memory\\" finds the frontman crooning amidst a psychedelic backdrop that sounds more like something from the '60s than it does '90s stoner-rock.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Though they did change many things from the book. It was still a good movie and visually stunning. It will be interesting how they compensate for the many important things they changed in this movie from how they were in the book in the coming sequels.
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|Swimming is so boring that the idea of tunes while I stroke is an inviting possibility.  I can't read the screen while I'm swimming or figure out which button to push while I'm swimming to repeat or skip a song but it keeps the music going. I hope it lasts a long time.<br /><br />That's what I wrote upon purchase. I've had it 3 weeks or so. Now it doesn't work. I called for service today (8-16-13) and got a recording. I expect better. I don't know why it isn't working and have no one to process a return or refund or possible fix. I hope this isn't $130 down the drain.<br /><br />I'll check with Amazon next but be warned. No customer support.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a very fun game! the graphics are awesome! if you like Temple Run (and of course the movie Despicable Me), this game is for you.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I Bought a Power Gen battery pack for around $25 about a year ago and it had a 2500 mah battery ( Also only outputted 0.6 Amps ) and needed a bigger size and for the price this is a lot better then power gen and other types of Battery packs. This product came nicely packaged which came to a surprise ( thought it was just come in a huge box with a ton of plastic but came in a slim box that kept it snug with a slip cover). I also like the fact that it comes with a 18 month Warranty vs the typical 12 month warranty. It comes with an included USB to micro usb while it is great that it comes included I would just wish it  was a little bit longer and it was nice it came with a Apple 30 pin Iphone( Up to the Iphone 4s)/ipods. The size of it is about the size of the galaxy s3 which is a lot bigger then my old battery pack but is a lot more sturdy in you hand and doesn't have a glossy finish to it making it slippery in your hand unlike my old battery pack. All in all this device is one of the best battery packs for its battery size, and how slim it is and the value of it ( price for the Size of battery ).
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The book plays out in a series of interviews-- a bold move that pays off in the beginning by creating suspense in a way that a straightforward sequence of event plot couldn't, but after a while all of the characters seemed to have the same voice and some of the vignettes were much less interesting than others. It might have been a good TV series or collection of animated stories like The Animatrix, but the book tested my patience.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like this game, if you like Mahjong you'll like this one.  It gets addictive and you just want to win one more... you know how that goes!!
B00DW36G32|3.0|Reasonably entertaining with (obviously) a terrific cast. I am honestly surprised that Travolta & Deniro appeared in this film, as the story seemed very contrived, and it had the feel of an indie film to me.<br /><br />It's got some action and good performances... And the story is mildly interesting.<br /><br />I would not rush out to see it, but it is a worthy rental for an evening at home.
B000Q76K24|5.0|This was an intricate story and a well constructed one, with a terrific cast and masterful performance by Matt Damon.  His is one of the most underused talents today.  There were many truths to be gained from the picture, but you had to figure those out for yourself, which involves you in as high quality way with the telling of the story.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Had to watch it to be ready for Red 2. This one might have been better but both were really good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game to play when you just want have some fun. Any age group will find this easy to play
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written and thought provoking. Kept my attention all the way through. Don't want to spoil it by writing more.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|The story line for Oblivion is filled with mystery and suspense. The beauty of the visual landscape belies the tragic circumstances that preceeded the immediate story. The actors do a fine job creating believable characters and, although the last 15 minutes of the movie was a bit anticlimactic, there were plenty of surprises to keep the story interesting.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I am hooked on this game! Even if they temp you to pay for extra help it is worth it lol!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wish there was more. There. Was enough of a challenge to keep it interesting but not too much to drive you nuts.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|As a teacher, one of my main jobs is to motivate, motivate students, parents, and at times, other staff members. It is hard to do when there is a history of unsuccessful behavior for the sole reason that it is how it has always been done. This book shows how even a single person, with the right motivational tool, can change the course of large institutions for the betterment of all involved. It even gave examples of how truly objectionable people were moved to work with the system to get the job done.<br />Whether you need to motivate change in yourself, your family, your work environment, or your city, this is a must read.
B005K17RU0|4.0|though the satellite version is not like a full satellite it works for my needs nice to play back what the weather did in the past

B002KGEORM|5.0|My husband and I cannot get enough of this show! It is right up there with The Soprano's and The Tudors! I get up in the morning<br />after watching an episode and am still thinking about it. My husband and I will even discuss this show in bed after watching. We<br />cannot believe how really impressionable the characters are. If it wasn't for having to go to work the next day we would keep on<br />watching and watching!

B00DU74U74|3.0|Very slow movie.  Poor acting.  I compare it to the terrible, emotionless acting that we all saw in the 1st Twilight movie.  I couldn't bring myself to watch more than 30 minutes.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|This movie was terrible. The acting was awful, which was surprising given the large cast. The visuals were not as amazing as anticipated, perhaps this was due to the streaming.  We honestly considered turning it off because it was so flat, dull and predictable. So much potential wasted.

B00BD6RFFS|3.0|The whole book has, in my opinion, only one purpose: engrave in your mind the &#34;canvas&#34; approach. Whatever the business you consider, take the habit of describing and developing it on a canvas. Worth the price? No. Worth that many pages? No. But the core idea is good.
0765348780|4.0|I just finished the 10 books in the series.  I love the fantasy and many of the characters.  I dislike a lot of the writing style.<br />Erickson's portrayal of these otherworlds, magic, and wars are outstanding. In each book, the main characters and interactions are compelling. It was easy to love WhiskeyJack, Quick Ben, Kalam, Apsalar, the Parans, and Anomander. Following their challenges, twists and turns was engaging.  Sparks of \\"this seems real\\" come through which is good with fantasy.  There was plenty of subtle humor in Bug, Tehol, Pust, and a couple others.  in this, the story wasn't formula fantasy where good guys chopped up bad guys to get some magic sword.  A+ on the underlying story and key characters.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I found these books are slow reading, taking a month to read 1000 pages when it normally takes a week.  Erickson's writing seems aimed at \\"he who writes the most words wins\\".  Fully 20% or more of the pages are the same drivel over and over.  \\"Dead, horror, broken bones and blood. Dead, bitterness, futility, despair.  He walked forever in despair and nihilism. My philosophy of life's meaninglessness. Oh, and the trees were lifeless, the plains were empty and boring, the children starving and hopeless.\\"  That's 20-30% of the books and it does get tedious.  Skim this junk and jump to the story.<br /><br />He also has a bad habit of writing several paragraphs of a person talking or thinking but doesn't tell you who it is.  Argh.  Cute once or twice but annoying the 50th time.  Again, skim ahead to find the speaker but in most cases, you can skip the whole boring diatribe.  His endless blathering about the futility of religion and life tells me he is one miserable person to be around.  Another annoying thing is that every book has about 50 characters to keep track of, 2/3s of them new faces.  Sorry -- I couldn't remember half of them by book 5 and lost touch with the character's importance when he pops up 3 books later.  Even inthe last book he introduces two complete cultures, kings, etc. that you don't know their motivations or importance.  This guy needs better editors who can wrestle his writing into sensibility. He knows the story and how everything fits but by book 5, the reader is lost on many fronts. Comparing him to Tolkien or Donaldson is a laugh.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the books and they filled a gap in my voracious reading time on the plane, at breakfast, and slow weekend hours.  There were many parts that were exciting, imaginative, and fit together cohesively.  I suggest reading the first book.  If the writing is not too annoying, keep going but be prepared to skim a lot of pages.

Recommend to everyone, not only for those interested in Science and technology, but also for all as na important knowledge and culture.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|FYI - barely relates to the movie.  But it's great.  I'm not a huge zombie fan, but this has less to do with zombies, which really just provide an interesting backdrop, and more to do with people in our global society.  I don't even much like current events and politics, which this book utilizes, but somehow even that was made interesting to me!  So considering the genre and subject material is outside of my personal interests and preferred reading content, the fact that I loved it should speak volumes!
B007STXHTM|4.0|Ive had my Hero 2 for a long time, using it in and out of the water and pool, but never for diving.  Took it on a dive and..... wow the video sucked.  Had no idea you needed different case. The round lens does not focus underwater.<br /><br />But the good news is THIS IS IT!  Great video after I got this, and using the GoPro software to color correct for loss of red when deeper than 10'.<br /><br />It works ok for out of water, just looks different than the round lens.  works great on surfboard, just not as wide angle.

B005D4YOY6|5.0|I love Keens. I wear them so much that they get a little &#34;funky&#34; before they actually wear out, so this is my third pair in 6 years. Color combo was exact to the picture, and a great deal compared to local stores.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book on so many levels.  I genuinely enjoy reading a passage or sentence that is so thought provoking or emotive that I want to read and re-read it to soak it in and appreciate the brilliance of it.  This book has so many of them.  I loved the way that Rosamund Lupton created the characters in the story to seem so emotionally real that you could truly feel the confusion, loss, and range of emotions that they were feeling.  As someone who has lost her younger adult sister, some of the descriptions in the story really took me back.  Anyone with a close sister will appreciate the relationship that is shared by Bee and her sister.<br /><br />The narrative that the story is written in, a letter to her sister, was both different and refreshing.  In addition to the other pluses, the mystery of the plot adds to the enjoyment by leaving you wondering and guessing the outcome up to the very end of the story.  My only criticism is that I thought that maybe the story could have wrapped up a little sooner than it did.<br /><br />Overall this was a great read that left me with tons of Kindle highlights that I will enjoy reading again for the beauty of the prose.
140006922X|1.0|I had the misfortune of reading the first few parts of \\"no god but God\\" and I skimmed through this one at the books store.  A secular/Atheist academic who grew up a christian or a Jew doesn't toe the line when it comes to their religion like this man does with his own religion. I challenge you to find one that does. They simply don't exist.<br /><br />One does not simply write an Atheist/secular view of one religion and religious view of another and expect any sort of credibility as a secular academic. His book \\"No god but God\\" all but glorifies Islam in its fundamental form, almost a \\"how to\\" beginner's guide to his own religion.  He blames the west for how Muslims interpret Islam... are you kidding me?! How does this work? \\"Ghosts don't exist in the world but they do in my attic\\"? It does not make sense.  Its just another case of -My religion is the true one and the other ones are just made up and here is some \\"historical books\\"-.  This man is a hypocrite who would never dare to write in a similar fashion about his own religion despite the glaring issues. You want a true secular academic then read Hitchens, he tackles ALL religions (and also an incredible writer).<br /><br />Despite your creed your beliefs or even what your historical interests in religion are, don't give money to this Islamic charlatan, there are plenty of better writers.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A simple letter, but was it really that simple?  A letter written long ago.  A letter indicating it was not allowed to be opened.  A letter that made John Paul's wife, Cecelia, quite curious.<br /><br />What harm would be done by opening the letter?  Cecelia was dying to open it, but the message  John-Paul wrote on the front of the envelope said it could not be opened until his death.  When Cecilia asked her husband about it, he said he had been sentimental when he wrote it, and that she should just put it away.  Obediently Cecilia, the good wife, put it away without opening it.<br /><br />Hints about the contents of the letter will peak your curiosity as it did Cecelia's.  When she did open the letter and found out what John-Paul had written, she couldn't believe it. How could this be true? Cecelia the perfect wife and fixer of everything couldn't fix this.<br /><br />Cecelia was the perfect wife, mother, and town citizen.  She knew everyone in town, and she knew everything about the city residents.  She remembered Tess when she came back to her childhood town because her husband didn't love her any more.  Rachel was also part of Cecelia's circle.  Rachel had a few heartbreaking situations in the past.  But...what Cecelia found in that letter was going to be more than a heartbreak for Rachel.<br /><br />THE HUSBAND'S SECRET was focused on this letter, Tess, Rachel and Cecilia.  The letter's secret had to do with an unknown connection between Tess, Cecelia, and Rachel and something that happened in the past that linked them together and something in the present that caused more heartache and pain.<br /><br />When the book begins, you will think it is going to be a book about a husband's affair, but it is more sinister than that.  It actually is a tragic secret.<br /><br />THE HUSBAND'S SECRET is about more than keeping secrets,  though.  It deals with a parent's love for his/her child and about the lengths parents go to in order to protect their children. It deals with right and wrong, and it deals with the thought - do we really know our spouse or significant other?<br /><br />Don't be mislead into thinking it is simply a book about secrets between a husband and his wife.  It is far more than that.  It is a book about secrets whether they are large or small and about our decisions to reveal the secret or to not reveal the secret.<br /><br />THE HUSBAND'S SECRET is an excellent read that will keep you pondering life, pondering the decisions we make, and thinking about the secrets most of us have.  What is your secret?  5/5<br /><br />This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher and LibraryThing in exchange for an honest review.ith right and wrong, and it deals with the thought - do we really know our spouse or significant other?<br /><br />Don't be mislead into thinking it is simply a book about secrets between a husband and his wife.

What is your secret?  5/5<br /><br />This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher and LibraryThing in exchange for an honest review.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Not only is this a great album by a great artist, but it is also done without the backing of some greedy record label.
140006922X|1.0|This book was funded (in a round about way) by George Soros in a effort to re-educate Christians.  Stick to the Bible and avoid this book.
140006922X|1.0|This book is full of inaccuracies, and the author does not hold the credentials he perports to having.  I see this as a Muslim effort to deminish Christianity by statings inaccuracies which he feels others will not take time to research through.<br /><br />Care must be taken in reading this garbage because it is very misleading and totally inaccurate as to its factual information.  This seems to be typical though in how Islamic teachings are promoted.. even though they are definitely found false with no doubt.<br /><br />It makes me sad to see one religion demean another, but this seems to be the normal process for Islamic process.
B00D6SBOWG|2.0|I just got this game but it's only a very small  sample of the real version. Was disappointed when I got to the 2nd level and it was locked. I enjoyed the little bit that I had. Maybe the full version will be a FAOD soon.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Don't ever loan this DVD out, you will never get it back...I've watched a lot of music DVD,s but this is truly one of the best if not the best, enjoy

B00992CF6W|4.0|it to much money.if I could lower down the price I would to about 2.99 to 3.99. it just to pricey.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|Heidi, Cindy and Carla sit in the park adjacent to their little neighborhood in Savannah, Georgia every afternoon, drinking cocktails and walking their dogs. Oh, and the most important activity - dishing up gossip about all their neighbors.<br /><br />And what gossip there is - competition for a widower of one of their group; revolving bed partners; shenanigans in Paris while on a trip won in a contest; and more. Many of the neighbors aren't really who they've said they are and that just adds to the intrigue.<br /><br />Well defined characters, crisp dialogue, a well plotted though convoluted storyline all come together for a fun southern mystery.<br /><br />I loved the cover of the book, too. Very appropriate.<br /><br />Sweet tea, anyone?<br /><br />Note: I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|love listening to some of the &#34;deep tracks&#34; from the albums. Much better than a greatest hits package and the price is unbelievable.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A very compelling story.  High-quality documentary which would appeal to people who don't usually like documentaries. You may or may not love the songs of Rodriguez, but you would still love the movie.  I happen to love his songs and especially his very unique voice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great Game Gameloft I Love It Minions are the best and they bring the game to life we love minions Great
1926667131|5.0|The book was interesting and thought provoking.  I am glad I decided to purchase it and I have share the information with others.  It is also an easy read, but requires a reflective mind to understand the concepts
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I wanted to hate it. I really did. But for some unfathomable reason it had just enough to keep me reading... not an occasional page here and there but full on -ignore family work and friends kind of immersive reading. It just worked for me. Likeable characters, dystopian world, love triangles- what else could I want??
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoy his writing style and the ease of his descriptions.  I enjoyed his other 2 books more, but thought this was quite good, too.  I felt there were too many characters and story lines and parts were abruptly shortened. But, this is a good read and would recommend it.
B00847KFDS|4.0|Older classics are given a fresh touch and the new stuff is the strongest of the set. Love Mystic Highway. Not sure why he sounds stronger on the new stuff--a little tired sounding on the collaborations.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Not the best James Bond ever done but possibly one of the top three.<br /><br />It does a good job of reintroducing iconic Bond Film characters like &#34;Q&#34; without being hokey about it.<br /><br />The double surprise ending was kind of cool
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Lee Child is one of the best story tellers. This is another, you can't put it down, book. I wish there were many more Reacher books.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|It really was funny, clean, good storyline, and just overall fun with the family.  Very glad I purchased it :)
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|This album has been worth the wait! I have been a fan since 1995 and after all this time they still do not disappoint! :) They sound as if they are just started and this would be their first album! They have some of their original sound with new flavor! So glad the whole group is back together! 20 years later you guys are still awesome! Thank you for such a great album! Consider your hard work paid off! <3 my BSB!
0375842209|4.0|really not captivating at the very beginning but once you finish the first few pages, the book is practically hard to put down. Great for kids as a summer book.

1611134226|5.0|I've read other reviews and wish I had a new word for excellent.  The writers are true story tellers.  I've read their entire library of books and they just keep getting better.  Love Pendergast.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|My boys love to play with each other or with dad on the Kindle.  The visuals and audio are just right.

B00DC7N9NS|5.0|It's really very hard to compete with the original, but this was such a great spin on a classic!  Loved it
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Can't wait for season 4!  Don't want to give too much away but I hope there is some happiness for someone then.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|What can I say I love these guys. I went to both afternoon and evening concert in my area and still had to have both the CD and DVD.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Sorry, but I will always call Darius Rucker &#34;Hootie&#34;  LOL.  I absolutely love this new CD! Highly recommend! Great soul/country/rock sound.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|The History of the Eagles is well worth the price. I have been a fan of the music for so long but I never took the time to learn about the group members themselves. It is a very interesting tale from the beginning. If you like the Eagles music then you will really appreciate this documentary.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A beautiful story of entwined lives in a complicated country. Haunting characters that will linger long after the book has ended. Highly recommended.
B008YWY0HK|2.0|This product was rated like new.  I did not know it was from a video store and it's hard telling how many times it's been played.  And the price indicated it was better, too.  For just a couple dollars more, I could have bought a brand new DVD.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The perfect fit for my Downton Abbey withdrawals -- I missed this series when it was originally on air, but had a lot of fun watching it.  It's a shame that the 4th season only had 6 episodes!
B0048IH666|5.0|Saving on CDs! Love my Kid Rock and I always get a good deal when I buy my CDs from Amazon.com. This arrived quickly and exactly as described. Thanks for a great transaction!
B00CXQL828|5.0|The Winery Dogs - Self Titled<br />Written by The Rock Man<br /><br />There is a new supergroup in town and their name is The Winery Dogs. The band is a trio of super talent, Billy Sheehan (Mr. Big) on bass, Mike Portnoy (Ex-Dream Theatre/Adrenaline Mob) on drums and Ritchie Kotzen (Solo/Ex-Mr. Big/Ex-Poison) on vocals and guitar. I do like a good supergroup, Damn Yankees, Chickenfoot and Bad English come to mind, and then there was the Sebastian Bach led Damnocracy, pity nothing ever came of that. Anyway, when I first heard about this new collaboration I wasn't quite sure how this would work.<br /><br />My initial problem when I heard about this project was the lead vocal factor. See I've never been a huge wrap for Ritchie Kotzen, as a guitarist he is excellent, but as a vocalist he has never really done it for me. So it was with some hesitation that I put this CD on, and you know what, occasionally I'm glad to be wrong about something. This album has made me see Ritchie Kotzen's vocal approach in a whole new light, he suits the style of songs perfectly and has elevated his vocal status.<br /><br />As for Sheehan and Portnoy do I really need to comment? I've followed Billy Sheehan since his days playing bass for David Lee Roth after he left Van Halen, and then when Sheehan joined Mr. Big I was there from the word go, I hold him in the same regard as Steve Harris (Iron Maiden).  Mike Portnoy is just amazing, I don't care what band he is in I could listen to him play all day long. If he is not recognized as one of the worlds top 20 drummers of all time I'd be shocked. He is constantly pushing the boundaries, coming up with patterns and rhythms most people can't even imagine.<br /><br />So you throw all these elements together and what do you get? A combination of rock, blues, funk and metal in a polished, well executed 13 track self titled, debut album. The album is full of OMG moments and the first one hits you with Elevate, the opening track, this has an amazing chorus, which as I said earlier showcases Kotzen's voice like never before. Desire is very radio friendly while The Other Side, Six Feet Deeper and Not Hopeless are genuine rockers. You Saved Me and Damaged bring some smooth sophistication to the record, The Dying is a heavy-ish styled ballad and Regret rounds out the album with its bluesy bar room feel, you may want to have a scotch in you hand when listening to this track.<br /><br />If you have followed any of these gentlemen then you will have some sort of idea as to what to expect. If you haven't, then sit down, buckle up and enjoy the ride, for this is the perfect opportunity to explore some genuinely talented musicians at work. Let's hope there are more albums of this quality to come in the future.orus, which as I said earlier showcases Kotzen's voice like never before.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|The book was too long. Too much, too much. Became a chore to finish it. I would not recommended it
0062119044|5.0|This book had to be re-read and the movie version was no disappointment either!  Lionel Shriver knows how to sucker punch her audience!!1 She nearly lulls you to sleep with Eva's endless moronic description of her pre-Kevin life and her almost adolescent insistence their first born must take her Armenian surname.  But as soon as you get impatient with Eva and her vanities, here comes Kevin and the picture comes into sharp focus.  You kick yourself as you reflect upon how much you disliked her in the beginning and find yourself feeling sorry for her.  Lionel's insiduous commentary on America's vanity, consumption and status worship comes into play throughout the piece as she slow walks you to her tremendous ending bowls you completely over!!! Her symbolism is incomparable and subtle. The only thing I did not understand was Eva never once considering to leave Franklin and Kevin to their own devices.  Was that a commentary on the American woman and her need for all to look put together no matter what? Lionel Shriver, you had me with more questions than answers and the end of your story!  Just what I want a book to do to me! I know I will read this book again!  After my hearts stops pounding so hard!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Completely flawless. I find the YouTube playback quality superb, it doesn't have the framerate issues caused by Flash on the desktop. Completely butter smooth 1080p.  Even in an area of my home with poor WiFi.<br /><br />Tab casting is impressively good especially for a beta.<br />Love the Play Music interface too.<br /><br />Just amazing how elegant it is, just pop open an app on your phone/tablet, hit a button, and you're off.  I don't know when Google added the functionality to these apps but it was right there waiting as soon as I had the Chromecast up and running, which took less than 3 minutes.<br /><br />Buy, Buy, Buy!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can waste so much time happily looking through all the boards, learning new things, and admiring so many things.  I have improved my crocheting.  I have seen pictures of places I didn't even know existed.  I love this site!
B002BVQU5A|4.0|I thought this movie was a tender story of a brother and sister, and a sensitive view of mental illness. I actually wanted to watch it because it was filmed in my home town, but found a lot more there. Johnny Depp was quirky and fun.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|Wonderful, exciting, scary, too real. There are many more words I could use to describe this book but, I am so star struck I cannot think of them right now. This book makes a believer out of me that anything is possible.
B009WUBERW|5.0|I thought it took the first movie to a new level and really enjoyed it. I would recommend it to my friends.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|The Chronicles are a perfect marriage of historical fiction and vampire fantasy.  The expansive vocabulary used to perfectly describe every fantastical event is not for the faint of heart, but you will feel smarter and more clever when you close these books!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is very fun and somewhat challanging. makes you think a little but over all a very fun app. would recommend for anyone over ten.
B00006JDVV|5.0|Great movie! Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale are great in this movie! It's one of my all time favorites! Love it!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|As usual another excellent book by Kathy Reich's.  I love her books .  This was a sad one because it involved babies but it was handled in such a way that it wasn't too bad.  I love a good mystery and Ms Reich's always comes through with them.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all but the squeamish.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is a pretty good movie.  I don't understand why they are not continuing the series.  This movie is better than most of the junk they are making these days.
B0081336FO|5.0|I WANT MORE!!!!  The actors portraying Sherlock and Holmes in this modern day setting could not be better.  The only down side is there aren't nearly enough episodes.  Come on guys - let's get it in gear!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Good entertainment. Enjoyed the acting and the story line. Was worth the watch. Can't wait till the next season!! HURRY!
B00E0ZEDI6|5.0|I have to say this little album exceeded even my expectations (and I have many when it comes to Adam Young's music because I love it!). The acoustic versions of \\"Good Time,\\" \\"Shooting Star,\\" and \\"Gold\\" were beautiful. They had a lullaby sort of feel to them, very magical and dreamy. Usually, I do not like remakes of songs but this was an exception. The two new songs were lovely as well. Very upbeat and happy and they make me even more excited for whenever he releases his new album. Buy this-you won't be disappointed.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I liked the book because I was always interested in Greek mythology and the Greek language also Greek gods mostly poseidon
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|Most annoying game ever. I started to like the game but as a casual gamer I found it ridiculous that a timer countdown caused you to lose all progress and start the &quot;f&quot; over. How dumb can a deveoper be to think a customer would find that entertaining. UNINSTALLED!!!
0312323867|5.0|Please read after something borrowed..they r super books!  I now think I will be buying all her books.!  I am currently reading Love The One You're With and it's turning out to be great also!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|This is an adult only fairy tale.  Lots of blood and gore but good acting.  I would compare this movie to the same genre as &#34;Van Helsing&#34; with Hugh Jackman.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|my wife love curly girl , so the rating is excellent . if anyone would like to be their own hairdresser please follor the direction of curly girl
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Better than the movie. Touching and heart warming but suspenseful and exciting!! Great book! I definitely recommend this book to friends!
B00E193TM2|1.0|This is utter crap. Complete crap. I am embarrassed that I heard this music- and i'm by myself at home! LOL It's disgusting to see other reviews of people loving this. Absolutely disgusting.
B0009WFFS6|1.0|I have ordered this item 3 times this year:<br />1. could not be played in the US<br />2. could not be played in the US<br />3.non-functional (on any continent)<br /><br />I love the product, but the service here is<br />  lamentable.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|This was my first Arthur C Clark book other than the 2001 series. I really enjoyed it. Sometimes his books get a little confusing jumping between characters, but by the end of the book it all makes sense.
B0026QC0TA|3.0|Not as good as most of Grishams books.....but entertaining. The movie seems somewhat disjointed, the plot doesnt' seem to flow smoothly....
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|excellent , I would recommend others to read the book. it  is a book  that is good  to read  and to purchase. please buy the book
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Very useful.  When I am typing something and Im not sure of the spelling of a word all I have to do is look it up.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I served in South Korea early in my military career and actually got to tour the DMZ, but really had no idea of the depth of deprivation that the poor citizens of the north face on a daily basis. It is sad that more is not being done to actively overthrown this lawless regime. I found the book interesting in how it categorically documented the &#34;banality of evil&#34; in the pages of the well written tome. It is by far the most interesting of the different books I have read about the hermit kingdom. If you are interested in the plight of North Korea's innocent victims and would like to learn more, buy this book.
B00CXX8KTA|5.0|Came back in 2013; old fashioned kick ass rock and roll. Best album in years for a 'classic rock' guy...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent TV!  Rates with such great series' as Roots, Lonesome Dove, West Wing, etc.  The story is excellent, the cast is stellar and the acting is superb.  I wish that the majority of TV was like this rather than Duck Dynasty and Swamp People crap!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A friend randomly suggested this book over dinner and I gave it a shot. I was hooked from the beginning and I can honestly say this got me interested in making time to read again. Great author and I will read the rest of his works too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I totally am in love with Downton Abbey!  I can't wait for season 4. But then I will wait for it to be free on amazon prime. I don't want to pay for it. I guess you'd call me cheap. But this is a great saga. Love BBC
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest series that I have watched in a long time. Please keep it going.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's soooooooo fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />it's a little bit like temple run.<br />your going to love it<br />(have fun)
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Love the background relationship with Haller and Bosch and enjoy stories using both characters well as when they are individual stories.  Not 5 stars because ending a little disappointing
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great app. It is a very interesting game. This game has great graphics and is entertaining. I would highly recommend this app.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Holy Cow.... I never expected this game to be sooooo addictive!  Its frickin awesome!  Downloaded as the free app of the day, and its easily worth 3 dollars. Its simple yet tricky enuff to keep you going for a long time.  I was just gonna download, try a level or two and then get back to it some other day.... 24 levels later.... addicted!  Nice job dev!  Can I buy more levels when I'm done?
B0060CXN2O|5.0|Love this movie! And it is still enjoyable after all of these years! My grandchildren age 6 and 4 watched it and found it very entertaining as well!
140006922X|5.0|\\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" is a new bestseller by Reza Aslan (how fascinating it is that \\"Aslan\\" is the name of the great Lion who is a symbol of Jesus Christ our Lord in the C.S. Lewis \\"Narnia Chronicles\\"). Aslan is an Iranian born Los Angeles based scholar of religion., The man writes with interest of Jesus of Nazareth and the fascinating world of first century Israel. The book is strong on history and geographical details which help make the Bible come alive for readers. Aslan admires Jesus as a great teacher and zealous Jewish rabbi strongly opposed to the Temple aristocracy and the Romans who brutally ruled Palestine. Such horrible figures as Herod Antipas the Jewish tetrarch as well as Romans Pontius Pilate, Festus and Felix are discussed in some depth. The book also discusses the importance of James the brother of Jesus who was a leader of the Jerusalem Christian movement and also Paul. Aslan believes Paul transformed Christianity into a worship of Jesus as the divine Son of God instead of merely a man. \\"Zealot\\" reads like a novel making it easy for readers lacking biblical knowledge an entry into the subject.<br />  As a Presbyterian pastor who believes Jesus was both human and divine I disagree with the author's views but applaud him for his excellent research into source materials. Aslan respects Christians making the point that faith belief and history are two different areas. The book is a good resource for biblical students. It is rich in quotable material. Among them are the following:<br />\\"The Holy of Holies-...is where the glory of God physically dwells.\\"-p. 6<br />\\"Unlike their pagan neighbors, the Jews do not have multiplicity of temples scattered across the land.\\"-p. 7<br />\\"Jerusalem, at the time of the Roman invasion, was home to a settled population of about a hundred thousand people.\\"-p. 11<br />\\"Roman rule, coming as it did after a century of independence, was not warmly received by the Jews.\\"-p. 13<br />\\"Bandit\\" was the generic term for any rebel or insurrectionist who employed armed violence against Rome or the Jewish collaborators.\\"-p. 18<br />\\"Herod's was a profligate and tyrannical rule marked by farcical excess and bestial acts of cruelty.\\"-p. 20<br />\\"The hillside hamlet of Nazareth is so small, so obscure, that its name does not appear in any ancient Jewish source before the third century C.E.\\"-p. 26<br />\\"It is estimated than nearly 97 percent of the Jewish peasantry could neither read nor write...\\"-p. 34<br />\\"Zeal implied a strict adherence to the Torah and the Law, a refusal to serve any foreign master-to serve any human master at all-and an uncompromising devotion to the sovereignty of God.\\"-p. 40<br />\\"All of the gospels, including the noncanonized scripture, confirm Jesus's miraculous deeds...\\"-p. 105<br />\\"...the story of Jesus' arrest, trial and execution was written for one reason only; to prove that he was the promised Messiah.\\"-p. 154<br />\\"But the Jews of Jesus' time had no conception whatsoever of a messiah who suffers and dies. They were awaiting a messiah who triumphs and lives.\\"-p. 166<br />\\"...Paul had no idea who the living Jesus was, nor did he care.\\"-p. 187. How can Aslan be sure of this point?<br />\\"What historical records do exist about Peter's role in early Christianity are exclusively about his leadership in the assembly in Rome...\\"-p. 263<br />  The book has two excellent maps of Herod's Temple complex and first century Israe.

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I loved the books when they came out in the 80s. I'm hoping they do all the books. They have done a very good job in the making of this series. Please don't stop.
0517548232|5.0|I read this years ago and have read several texts on economics and free market capitalism since. This masterpiece remains as my favorite book ever read. Highly highly recommended for any thinking mind out there.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked it so very much. It was fun, and kepted me interested the whole time I just wish there was more
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|The writing, as is everything Neil Gaiman does was superb, but the story lacked the fabulous scope and characters that exist in Neverwhere and American Gods. A very well done book very much worth reading, but not his best.
B007MDB71O|4.0|This movie is a good mix of future, past, and great effects. I thought the plot was good and the story line was fun.  The characters were good and interesting.  It left you wanting more when it's over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|lots of action not enough romance a person that likes thrillers<br /> action adventure books and fiction books about groups with lots of epic moments
B007SXB498|5.0|While Pride and Prejudice will remain my personal Jane Austen book, Sense and Sensibility offers much of the same twists, the same satirical approach to personalities and customs of the time.  Well worth a read!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love historical fiction and this is  perfect entertainment for me.  I really enjoy getting a glimpse of what life was like in another time and place.
B00DU74U74|4.0|The aliens are called Souls and they have traveled from planet to planet taking over bodies and changing the said planets for the better. The story starts out when the entire planet has almost been concurred with only a few people not being controlled by  a soul. One of the souls (Wanderer) is placed into a body and starts to feel emotions it has never felt before from the young girls memories and starts to become empathetic to her plight. It finally helps the humans reverse some of what is happening but no complete solutions. The Souls are very delecate and really gullable. I don't know how they ever got started since they space travel in a little sliver footballs, which are not fast either, and need to be coaxed out and placed right next to a cut in the back of the neck. I'll have to read the book I guess to see how it all started.
0061743526|5.0|This is a classic. Wanted to get a copy before this is pulled from educational reading. This novel tells the truth about how people look at others without knowing the facts. It is just an awesome book that every American should read!
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|I am heartbroken. It's a sad day to say this, but it has to be said: \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" is a dud. The fifth instalment in the beloved \\"Die Hard\\" saga ends up as the worst of the series so far; it falters thanks to a weak characterization, even weaker screen writing, lack of worthy villains, absurd action sequences and incoherent direction. You can bet this movie will be mentioned in the same sentence with \\"Rocky V\\", \\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\\", \\"Speed 2: Cruise Control\\", \\"Die Another Day\\" and \\"Batman & Robin\\". Not even the R-rating and the return of the famous \\"Yippie ki yay\\" line in full can save this one.
B00005NTJM|5.0|\\"Jazz flute is not for Wimps.\\"<br />Was that Ian Anderson overdubbing Will Farrel playing flute in the jazz bar scene in the movie Anchorman: the Legend of Ron Burgundy? There's no credit given in the end credits.<br />Anyway, what a great album. It's the one Tull album I listen to the most next to \\"Living in the Past\\".<br />I'm a fan of the 'dated' recording styles of the 60s & 70s. The older recordings sound more like live performances to me. This remaster sounds like they've just cleaned the tracks up a bit. Good job!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such a cute, entertaining game. Having a blast taking care of my horse Copper. 30 years old and still enjoying it.
1608871452|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for my niece and wish I had ordered one for myself too. It's so much more than a book to read; it's just filled with surprises and momentos from our favorite episodes. The stories behind the scenes are really interesting and well written. The artwork is top notch, so many pictures, post cards, etc. There can be no reason to complain about this book. I know she will be thrilled to receive this. I am so excited  and proud to give this as a gift.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|This movie is a murder mystery, spy yarn and comedy all rolled into one. Very well done and a lot of good story tellers in it too.
1781162646|5.0|This book was awesome from start to finish. I couldn't put it down. I have always enjoyed theme parks, but hearing the jargon used and the precise descriptions Stephen King uses keeps you waiting to see what id going to happen in the next paragraph. Hopefully Joyland will be made into a movie/DVD and I will purchase it as soon as it is available.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This movie didn't disappoint me at all. Yes, it had some issues, but was a great view. Visually, the film is a delight. Sam Raimi turns Oz into its own wonderland without it ever seeming predictable or tired. Raimi gives audiences exactly what they're looking for. Gems, flowers, waterfalls, mountains, rock formations, sunsets, etc. that are completely breathtaking. Not only that, but the CGI is crisp and clean. A must watch, well worth the time effort to watch.
1881273156|5.0|Learn about others love language and learn better communication skills.  You can apply what you learn here with family, friends, and co-workers.  In fact, learn more about ones self along the way.  The text is written in an enjoyable way and I wanted to read it over and over.  Relationships are important and this book helps you improve the ones you are involved in.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|I am hooked on this album! Downloaded it here yesterday and it was the best thing I've done this summer!! I love every single song and there aren't many albums that I can say that about. Each album they have released is different enough from the last that they never bore me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|there were levels I had to leave and come back another day to figure out but finally got through all 10 levels. Waiting for the next rounds.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|works great on kindle fire. it was free but would have purchased it. what's not to love about the minions?!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Bought this product for my little girl's room.  She is 5 and in LOVE with Disney princesses.  She was so excited to see the beautiful images with vibrant colors and couldn't wait to have me put them up on the wall.  VERY easy to use, (sticker) &#34;jewels&#34; added perfect amount of sparkle--couldn't be happier with this product!!
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|Enjoyed this series,  horrible intro music....  the show had potential , too bad last season the writting was all over the<br />place and got the show cancelled<br /><br />Amazon Prime is not bad but this show streams with too many problems, pauses, jitter, etc
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is very handy when you need a quick light to find something you've dropped,or to set a romantic mood with the different colors you can choose from. I've used it for many different things, and its never let me down.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This famous icon works great on my kindle, letting me instantly click on it.  I recommend it highly for those of us who may need that!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I just liked the story line!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm drawn to mysterys . this one kept you guessing till the end what was going to happen to Jacob.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have never been so delighted and fascinated as I am with Pinterest.  It is amazing to see all the different ideas. and interests others pin. Whatever you want you can find it on Pinterest.  I have tried so many recipes! And so many paper crafting projects.  Best of all, though, are the humorous and inspiring pins --it makes one realize that our world is filled with good, kind, and intelligent people
B002GHIPYI|4.0|These headphones are pretty good, very good if you consider the price you paid for them. While they are good, they can be made better. There are audio communities that tout the greatness of these headphones, and they are not wrong. However, you will need to spend extra if you want to hear what they are talking about.<br /><br />For me, I bought another set of ear pads (the stock ones can make your ears a little sweaty) and I had it sent off to be recabled (I have not soldered and would rather spend extra money getting it done right than being frustrated at my efforts). The difference I experience has been substantial. I felt that the upgrades I made were worth it, but ymmv.<br /><br />In the end, these are good headphones and considerably less expensive than competing brands. Aside from the Monoprice headphones, I do not know of a better price/performance set.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very enjoyable app. Levels range in difficulty.  All are very do'able. Some levels require a bit more thought to them. I'd recommend this app to anyone.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|This movie has so many wonderful actors.  One of my favorites.  Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart and Katherine Hepburn.  Just wonderful.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|Maybe if I would have given this game a chance. Maybe I am sick of these type of games. I played it for 15 minutes and deleted it.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I like the story line,,, and I like King & Maxwell.  they make a good team.... I like the spin off TV program  with the same characters.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|This book is full of practical and VERY important information regarding nutrition. I Highly recommend this book to those wishing to become healthier!
B005544V6A|5.0|I love the fast pace, strong female as well as male characters in a predominantly male atmosphere and the chemistry between the two primary characters.  The people who I've recommended this to love the show as much as I do.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|You will really enjoy watching this movie... the situations Mark Wahlberg gets into with Ted, a talking Teddy Bear is outrageous. Ted, The Teddy Bear is so funny, it's almost unbelievable, he has a natural sense of humor, that's over the top! Incredible. A great movie for Mark Wahlberg, his absolute best. Seth MacFarlane is the director, the writer and the voice of Ted! The comedy world is definitely going to hear a lot more about Seth MacFarlane. What an excellent comedy! All the actors and actresses did very well.
B00CWVF2GC|4.0|Especially enjoyed this sequel to Jossi and Jagger - ten years later after the tragic death of Jagger (Lior) who's given himself the nickname after Mick Jagger.  Jossi, now looking older, remains as a most likeable man, and his quiet way of dealing with the death of Lior is touching.  Love this character - he's beautifully played.  And he fins his way indeed, the story ending on a happy note - not exactly a tear jerker, but making one feel all warm inside.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the story and most of the book. Couldn't put it down once I started reading it. as I was hoping for a different ending, was disappointed. But still enjoyed the book !
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have had this for only one day but I love it already.<br /><br />SET UP<br />In a word, easy. I had it setup in about 15 minutes from out of the box to watching YouTube on my TV. (I had an existing wifi network)<br /><br />Performance<br />I saw only minimal lag from the time of sending video to my TV and it showing up, after that I had no issues with stuttering or jerky video. I have about a 3 mb/s internet connection and a 42\\" TV and the quality was quite good.<br /><br />Applications<br />I would like to see more support for Chrome on Android, as of now you can only share a chrome browser tab if you are on a computer, not the tablet or phone as I understand it. I assume this is coming in the future along with other great apps, but for now Netflix, YouTube, Google Music and Movies and anything you can find on Chrome is enough to make me happy with this purchase.<br /><br />Price - You can't beat it.<br /><br />I am thinking about getting another one as well as buying one for the parents.
B008OOYALE|5.0|take care ur baby drags and lol Til ya pop. luv this app and reccomend it to any Sim fans
B001XVP9CY|3.0|Overall, this is still a great movie.<br /><br />However, the internal monologue for Deckard was removed in this 'cut' of the film which left this version feeling empty and disjointed.  In the theatrical release, Deckard explains a lot about the society and gives some extra information about what is going on in the film.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|tons of fun to play. combines luck and strategy. have always enjoyed this type of game since the bbs days. can't give it 5 stars because it does lock up the kindle at times which is frustrating.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Not sure why we can't get the &#34;real&#34; YouTube on this platform. Being an iPad/iPhone user, I'm really disappointed in the app market and the &#34;sorta&#34; apps that are out there.<br /><br />vTube crashes and freezes on occasion... really a shame.
B00821PCJS|3.0|Started watching Falling Skies, and while I like the show, it was hard to understand what was happening at first.  Going to continue watching, though.  Love Sci-Fi.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is a great history of some of the folks that shaped this country and made huge contributions to the planet. I highly recommend it
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|Great movie, excellent cast, plot and acting.  Excellent action and martial arts scenes.  Never saw it in the big screen, little jewel.  Certainly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read the whole series and I am reading this one again because it was so good a little risque but very good read
B003JA5NVE|4.0|Ah saying good bye to Star Hallows and the Gilmore girls!! But it ends on a good note with lotsa fun and good moments for all of us.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I am a closet Trekkie, and I give this a big thumbs-up.  The sound and picture graphics are outstanding, and I would recommend to anyone who is a Trek fan to buy this.
B00821OX98|5.0|Good show but sorry I watched it! Season 3 Amazon wants money for it! I guess Amazon prime aint that great.
B00009RGBS|5.0|One of the best movies in my collection! We need more movies like this for sure! Thank you so much!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|It was very fast and was in perfect condition! The product was exactly as described and I look forward to purchasing more in the future.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am amazed that the producers have kept the show so fresh. I love that they have the guts to kill off key characters. That's all I'm going to say. Enjoy.
B00AB2NYNC|4.0|I got this since I enjoyed listening to these guys on Pandora.<br />It is an excellent set with 2 audio CDs and a pretty awesome DVD.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|This is my absolute favorite of the Star Trek original series.  The humor and the suspense are wonderful and its always great to spend time with this crew.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love it  is a grate game it is very fun  just don't spend your money<br />Other wise it's a good game
B00992CF6W|5.0|Or is it impossible! I can't get a skin on minecraft pocket edition! It says: unauthorized request. I don't know why!
B009ANP4F4|5.0|It was very fast and was in perfect condition! The product was exactly as described and I look forward to purchasing more in the future.
B0055S348W|5.0|Great app works perfectly, exactly what I was looking for, definatly recommend. I have a Kodak printer a Samsung phone and tablet which only lets you print wirelessly to a Samsung printer which is a pain, and the Kodak print apps are a hassle only good for pictures and certain documents, and no good to print email, web, etc. So I got this app and it's great.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Haven't finished the book yet but so far it typical Reacher. If you have enjoyed the past books you should like this one too.
B003F46RVO|5.0|Young Keifer and hot Jason and hotter sax guy??  Love!  Way better than those Twilight vampires.  And it has both Corys
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app was very challenging..loved solving the rooms..some were frustrating but that's what made it fun..good job..can't wait for more!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm only 8 but I love this game. I bought it and I don't know why people only gave it 1 or 2 stars. It looks so real and I really like this game.
1401201911|5.0|This novel asks a great question: would Superman be the same had his escape pod landed on Russian sole as opposed to American? Would he still be the selfless defender of our planet? Or are all of Superman's values created by American ideals?<br /><br />Superman is THE American hero. He always has been. The 'S' on his chest is almost as American as the flag itself. That's what makes this novel so interesting. Seeing him grow up during the Cold War and adopt the communistic values of Russia really tests what Superman is really about.<br /><br />Luckily, other heroes get alternate treatments. Wonder Woman is mostly the same, though their relationship is slightly more strained. There is an interesting take on Batman and even the Green Lantern.<br /><br />The story is very long and detailed. Lots of talking, discussing, and even some political matters. Halfway through the story, however, it picks up into some very morally hectic situations that Superman must face. Will he commit himself to his country, or humanity itself?<br /><br />Even if you're not a fan of Superman, I would consider picking up this alternate take. It's an extremely interesting set up that makes this alternate reality very believable. This is easily one of my favorite graphic novels, and I'm not even a big Superman fan.<br /><br />This is one graphic novel that I would consider a true classic. Pick it up.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I gave Dracula 5 stars because it is the epitome of the vampire genre.  There were certainly legends and lore about them prior to this, but Bram Stoker wrote a story that still scares me at night.  I would recommend this book for anyone looking for the grown-up version of Twilight.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|There may be spoilers below.  I will try not to put them in.<br /><br />Ok, my mom and I went to see this.  We kept hearing how scary it was and I was interested to see what made it so.  That being said.  I did not think this movie was scary at all.  I believe that is because it was not a movie that was made with the purpose if scaring you.  It was in fact made to show you the story of what happened to these people.  A husband and wife with 5 kids move into a new house.  Things start to happen.  You will find out the thing that holds the evil and why it is doing what it is doing.  As far as blood and guys go, I do not believe there was much of either.  There was blood at points.  But nothing like horror movies now a days.  With blood flying out of people heads and what not.  Everything in this movie had a purpose.  That is because it was real life.  I was glued to the screen.  It is all very interesting to imagine something so unexplainable happens.  People believe in things they can see and touch.  This thing is something else.  Something pure evil.  It is basically a modern day exorcist.  But unlike The Exorcist, it really does not show you much of the person or persons who are possessed.  You may see them for a bit, but the movie is really about a GROWING evil within a location towards a group of people.  You find out who and why and see the outcome.  If you are interested in the unexplained or paranormal stuff, I believe you will enjoy this movie.  I have already pre ordered it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The upgraded version is not as user friendly.  I used to use it several times daily....not so anymore!  How can an upgrade be worse?
B00C6MYITO|5.0|I am not sure why I hadn't actually read the novels. Last week I once again saw the movie, and I just had to know what happened  to Pollyanna . First I had to read part one,as movies are never like the books, then on to book two.  I am disappointed only in the fact I waited so long to read the novels.  I am so very \\"glad\\"  I finally read them!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love this app for recipes and craft ideas. this app is also. good for other ideas like a baby's room.
1401225756|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She'd always been interested in the material so I picked it up and took a look at it. What I read was unlike anything I had seen before. The Sandman had some reputation, but I'd never looked into it myself. Let's just say I read the whole thing before even giving it to her.<br /><br />The story is all over the place. In the first few issues it covers an entire lifetime, following the magical capture of Dream, Death's brother. As a result, the dream realm is disrupted and people all over the world are falling into comas or can just never get to sleep. Eventually Dream is released, and he returns to his realm to find that it has been completely overturned. Forced to start his kingdom anew, Dream goes on a journey that is filled with fantastic imagery that blew my mind.<br /><br />The art is beautiful. The dream realm is fantastic and really draws you in. While the story got a little confusing and hard to follow at times, the art always brought my attention back. The Sandman has impressive visuals that make every page worth looking over for more than a minute.<br /><br />While I'm not sure if I'll continue the series, what I saw was a really great start to what is deemed as a \\"classic\\" comic book series. I know I enjoyed what I read of it, and I'm sure my girlfriend enjoyed it as well. Definitely a unique experience that's hard to find anymore.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book because it gives an insightful look at Jesus of Nazareth the person, not Jesus the Christ.  Additionally I loved the fact that all the authors sources were cited and conflicting opinions listed clearly.  This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in the history of the time in Judea and Palestine.
B003YUBXRM|4.0|I really enjoyed all the action. The story was fast paced, well written and yet sensitive. Alex is a great hero with his heart in the right place. The book stands alone but is still part of the series. A fun read for any young adults.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|This was really good like all of the previous Die Hard movies.  I would say the theatrical version and not the Extended version is the best to watch.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I love it.  I loved the movies, the musicals and the book.  Good characterization from the wretched and despicable, unfortunate and desperate, to the honorable and good.  And I think considering everything, it did end well.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Was so happy to see the series available on amazon.com -- I always liked the show when I could catch it...finally I could see the series from first episode to last. Love the show even more!
1401207529|5.0|I've only been into comics for a couple years now and \\"Batman: Year One\\" has been recommended to me many times. It's considered the classic Batman origin story and it's clear that it's influence has even made it to the silver screen with \\"Batman Begins\\". After reading \\"The Dark Knights Returns\\", I had to get my hands on more Batman.<br /><br />While the title is \\"Batman: Year One\\", this story is more about Gotham as a whole. Half of the story is told from Commissioner Gordon's perspective as he works his way up through all of the crooked cops of Gotham. His character is wonderful. While it is shown that he is essentially the goody two shoe's of Gotham's law enforcement, the corruption of the city catches up to him.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne is returning from years overseas where he has honed his skills in order to become a vigilante. He has his mind set on creating a persona that will strike fear into the criminal underworld so that he can make a difference in Gotham. The city ruined his life, so naturally he feels the need to deliver vengeance.<br /><br />The drawings are a little more mundane than most Batman stories. Lots of browns, grays, and blacks. It helps establish a very moody tone, as Gotham isn't a happy place. While Gordon is doing his best to keep crooked cops off his back, Batman is learning from many mistakes as he tries to overthrow the big whigs of Gotham city.<br /><br />It's a great story. The pacing is interesting as it switches perspectives a lot between Gordon and Bruce. It helps show two sides of the city. All in all, it was an entertaining read, though it was very short. Only four issues are contained, so it's easy to pick it up and read it in one sitting. While I didn't like it as much as \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", \\"Batman: Year One\\" is something that every Batman fan should read in order to understand the history of Batman's origins.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The book was the best thought provoking sad funny and unique all at the same time  a good book for young readers
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|My only disappointment is that this app cost:( However I use this app everyday to check my emails so I guess it was worth it
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Bought BAKERSFIELD cd because VINCE GILL is incredibly talented. His voice & how he masters the Guitar is pure pleasure. BAKERSFIELD takes us back to good country music, and the steel,guitar played by Paul FRANKLIN adds to this incredible CD. Every track on this CD IS totally AWESOME. Highly RECOMMEND Bakersfield.
B008Y76VW2|4.0|I like this movie and thought it could be a little more action in it. Not the worst movie I have seen
0062073192|5.0|My daughter has enjoyed it. She's a huge fan of the show! Good book It's an easy read. If you like the show get it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus Luttrell and the rest of the U.S. Navy SEALs are truly the best fighting force in the world.  Luttrell has memorialized his fallen comrades in a way that only he could because he was the lone survivor.  I think this book should be required reading for every member of Congress as well as the President as well as the U.S. media.  The Islmofacist don't honor the Geneva Convention and our troops shouldn't be hamstrung by it when fighting them.  The jihadists are unconventional and should be fought using unconventional methods especially where rules of engagement are concerned.  Luttrell makes this point very clear as well as the undaunted courage and fighting spirit shown by his fallen brothers and him.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
141694737X|5.0|Great book, fun flaps, and it does not break easily. Order was very timely and overall the story content is great.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I have never had Showtime but had heard about this series from friends. It is pretty accurate historically and truly takes you into the lives of the people in 16th century Great Britain and lands nearby.
B00AYB0YFQ|4.0|My grand kids watched this movie and watched the serious of scary movies one right after the other. V ery like able
B0014JIFWG|5.0|I purchased this shoe to use in a dietary aide position in an assisted living home.  My feet are a US13.5 wide, so I've always had problems finding shoes that fit and are comfortable.  Putting the shoes on for the first time, I found them to be the perfect width, however, I was concerned that there was a .5-.75 inches of extra space in the toe of the shoe.  I thought I had ordered the wrong size.  Still, I had them, so I went on to wear them to work.<br /><br />After wearing them for several weeks, I can say that I don't find any problem with the extra toe space.  The may, in fact, be designed like that.  I'm not sure, but these shoes are comfortable.  I would dare to say that they are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn.  My dogs would be barking after several hours on my feet.  Wearing these shoes, there is almost no soreness.  I'm shocked by this.  As stated above, I can almost never find a pair of those that fit and are comfortable.<br /><br />The rubbery construction is great because the entire shoe can be hosed off at the end of the day.  The slip-resistant soles are on par with other slip-resistant shoes I've owned in the past, and offer adequate, but not infallible, slip protection.<br /><br />I have been suggesting Crocs shoes to friends and family since receiving this pair.  I feel that at this price, these shoes are an amazing value, and are more comfortable as Birkenstocks I own costing three times as much.  I plan on looking into other crocs shoes in the future.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Lots of fun.  Have not played it that much, but the little bit I played it was swell.  Fun game.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|No matter how many of Jodi Picoult's books I read I keep coming back for more.  The Pact is a hard hitting book on several levels: how well do we really know our children, what is the effect of loss on those we love (particularly our spouses), how the justice system really works, and last but by no means least,  how can we avoid what Emily's and Chris's parents went through.  Picoult digs deeply into our own psyches to help us find the answers to these dilemmas.
1594203334|5.0|Delightful book that will convince new parents of the long-term pay-off of their efforts to raise children with a bedtime and mealtime routine, a healthy openness to all sort of food experiences, and a sensible approach to the adult/child control issue.
B00CKYIENY|5.0|I love Pride and Prejudice so much that I want to squeal like a little girl just thinking about it. It's a great book with well developed characters that I fell in love with quickly. I think everyone needs to experience the greatness of Jane Austen. Austen's writing is a perfect example of a timeless story. I feel like I can relate to the characters even though the characters were created about 200 years ago. I had trouble with understanding the language at first, but I found it's easier to understand if you read it out loud in a British accent. I know it sounds ridiculous, but the British accent made the language seem less strange. I recommend that everyone reads this book no matter what age you are.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love interest!!so much fun:)<br />Love to search ideas, you can get caught up in it for a while!  Great aT to share ideas.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Amazing show! So good, well written and funny. It NEVER gets old. A must watch show for any avid tv fans
B004NOH9LW|1.0|This is a ridiculous movie where nothing happens and very boring , don't waste your time and money on it!
B007VUA7VO|1.0|i got this app when i fist got my kindle and it worked perfectly. then a few weeis ago i updated the app and i put on the settings where  the kindle says &quot; The battery is at 50% &quot; but it doesnt say a word!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is for hopeless romantic. Those whom had ever had happy end with all sorts of relationships, good guys and bad guy ,all are the same. If u what to dream of what would be your life if this happen to you...read it ...won't disappoint you .you may find interesting how many times you lived something like that to tell but u never have the guts to sit a write a novel and make millions with a sad history.
B008MVPGHG|5.0|Works great to come forward before the first day of active wear and comfortable feet.<br />I do not go.<br />Feet walking feet.
B004LWZW8S|3.0|If you enjoyed &#34;300&#34; with it's dark, CGI atmosphere and exaggerated slow motion action scenes you will, probably, enjoy Immortals. I did not care for those aspects in either &#34;300&#34; or &#34;Immortals&#34;. This is a very violent movie with much gratuitous bloodletting. The CGI backdrops seemed a little over the top.<br /><br />Henry Cavill was the reason I purchased this film. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance in &#34;Man of Steel&#34; and wanted to see more from this fine actor. I was not disappointed with his efforts. Mickey Rourke's character seemed to be a retread of his &#34;Ironman II&#34; performance as Whiplash. The film, in general, is a bit depressing. As I said, you might like it. It just was not was I had hoped for.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|This was an enjoyable game. I got it as the free app of the day. So I didn't feel like I wasted any money. I would have felt let down if I had spent money on this. I finished this game in about 30 min. I would like to see more levels or more challenging levels.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|The case was in one piece but not exactly pretty. The cd was scratched but the movie works fine so.
B006BG1MPO|5.0|This was a very honest description ,mailed in a timely manor,and a fair price.the record arrived in great shape,I live we where it's 100 degrees and it sat by my cattle gate for 7 hours,it was fine!Would recommend to anyone that wishes to<br />Purchase vinyl records,HONEST SELLER
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I really love this game so much. and can't wait what there going to do next.<br /> You have to play this game it's so much fun!!!!!!
0345347951|5.0|I was given this book back when I was in elementary school.  I keep re-reading it.  Still love it in my 50's.  That's got to tell you something.<br /><br />Clarke starts us off in (his) modern-day America.  (This was written around 1953, so no cell-phones, no internet ... you'll need to remind yourself of that from time to time, but surprisingly seldom.)  Suddenly large spaceships hover over the major population centers of the world.  There is contact ... but nobody lays eyes on these visitors.  They're peaceful, beneficial, but who or what are they?<br /><br />Sure, it sounds like a schlockey episode of The Twilight Zone, but I assure you, it is NOT a cookbook.  (I apologize to those who didn't get that joke.)  This is a well-developed plot that intersects science, religion, and what it means to be human.  Clarke's talent for story-telling is unmatched here.  He creates a world that completely envelopes me, but I never feel like I'm reading page after page of exposition.  This is tight, exciting, page-turning ... even after decades of re-reading.

0345529057|5.0|In my opinion George R.R. Martin is one of the most exciting writers of the age. Complex societal architecture, complex characterisation and the human element combine to deliver an addictive storyline.

161655164X|5.0|The last of Us is one of the best games I've played in a long time, this book embraces the creative process and shows you how much passion was put into making this.
0525953590|5.0|The book was an excellent read.  The physics was distilled for a popular crowd and was broken down in basic terms.  But, as a philosopher, I did have trouble envisioning action at a distance and couldn't keep track of the particle gallery/zoo easily.  However, that's my problem.  The book was informative, and I especially liked the historical/biographical aspects of it.  Highly recommend it!!!
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|I like this number game and have played quite a bit on paper. This electronic version is well done and works well. I enjoy it! That is what matters when it comes to a game, right?
0765316994|5.0|A friend recommended this book, but I've been so crazy backed up in life lately that it feels like I never have time to read, so I didn't think I would get around to it. This book made me find the time. It has humor and action and is surprisingly profound in places.<br /><br />I did feel the &#34;codas&#34; were a little bit indulgent of the author, maybe a teensy bit unnecessary, but I still enjoyed them. It just seemed as if every time I thought the story was over it would start again, which in some ways was  nice because it let me experience/linger with the characters for a little longer, but it didn't really advance the plot in anyway. I still liked them.
B002R5QPRI|4.0|We are replacing the VHS copy that we already have of this movie and we obviously like it or we would not be replacing it
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|The media hype drew me to this film. My curiosity was piqued, and I entered the theater with exuberance and great expectation. I wanted to really like the film, but found myself merely liking it. The problem for me is too many parallels to other horror films of the past half century: The shrouded chair-bound body in the basement with a bare light bulb swinging overhead is classic Hitchcock, as are the scenes of birds flying pell mell into the side of the house, threatening the humans within. Electronic surveillance of supernatural activity in targeted rooms has been skillfully implemented in the recent films of Oren Peli. Loud, thundering pounding on doors and walls was the trademark of 1963's the Haunting. The theme of female demonic malevolence has most recently been well-realized by \\"The Woman in Black\\", portrayed by Liz White. And demonic possession itself, with a barfing, bruised, baleful female victim was filmed to chilling perfection forty years ago by Friedkin, based on Blatty's novel.<br /><br />Director Wan has created a well-crafted synthesis of many of the best elements of paranormal possession films of the past fifty years. He is skillful in the timing of classic \\"cardiac jump moments\\", when a monster pops out from behind a door, in a mirror, or leaps from overhead. His camera angles are interesting and inventive, with some dizzying inverted moments.<br /><br />The movie is worth seeing. Just don't be surprised if you have a nagging feeling you have seen much of this before, and don't yearn for too much creativity.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I like Falling Skies. I am a huge syfy fan and I find this story line very interesting.<br />They have some cool aliens in this series and the fight for mankind is awesome. It seems that<br />the writers are not afraid to kill off a character or two. Makes it seem more realistic.<br />Plus there are frequent things getting blown-up. Now it doesn't get any better then that.<br />It would even be better if my Apple TV would work with Amazon Prime!<br />I only get the sound but no picture, I should call tech support or something
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I love this game. I love the challenge of trying to make it to the next level. One of my favorite games to play.
B0049J0CTM|2.0|I rented this for my daughter for three days.  It took a while to download but once it did, all was fine, until she wanted to stop watching for a little while, so we turned it off.  She went back later to watch and you could only hear it, all that was showing on the screen was the loading cirlcle, constantly turning but never showing the movie, needless to say she was upset.

1885167776|5.0|The style of presentation of this self help book by Gary Keller with Jay Papasan is what makes the difference between this book of advice on how to achieve goals and the life we want and the myriad others is the simplicity of approach. The aspects of the book are presented in an order that draws the reader in, waiting for the payoff line, then surprising that reader with the simplicity of the process. The major theme of the book is FOCUS - whether that be in clearing your table of all things except that ONE thing that is foremost in your mind to accomplish, finding the real you inside the head that rules your body and working, on making that more authentic, discovering that many aspects of the belief system in which we function are lies, understanding and avoiding the thieves of productivity, and in the end - finding the ONE thing in every aspect of how we think, organize our day, work, relate to our business and our family and our spirituality and our citizenship on this planet that will keep us directed and lead the way to accomplish honest goals.<br /><br />The book is written in such a way that points are made, or misconceptions disturbed, that with the use of a few simple graphs and diagrams and examples from both the author and some well known successful people, a very savvy trick of underlining memorable or memorizable phrases, and ending each chapter's topic at hand with a set of Big Ideas.  It is basic learning technique we learned in grade school reiterated in the here and now as a very valuable tool of retaining all the copious information shared here.<br /><br />This book THE ONE THING -THE SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE TRUTH BEHIND EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS reads well and draws the reader back into certain sections as the aha! Moments become more frequent, sort of like increasing the amount of reps we do as exercise gradually strengthens us in workouts. There is sound knowledge to be gained by reading this book and it is likely to hit the bestseller list soon - it just that user friendly and sound. For more about the process, READ the book! Grady Harp, July 13st that user friendly and sound. For more about the process, READ the book! Grady Harp, July 13

B003G8Y4QO|5.0|The first episode drew me in. My heart broke for Amelia Pond. I needed to know what was going to happen to her and what that crack in her bedroom wall was all about.<br /><br />The season is well crafted, with an over-arching theme from start to finish. Individual episodes are creative and clever, providing puzzles that are not easily solved.<br /><br />once I saw the first episode, I had to see it through to the end. I was not disappointed!
B009KUWWW0|5.0|This is a very interesting book, true to Ken Follett's delightful style.  The book, although similar to &#34;Pillars&#34; demonstrates to the reader the difference in life in Kingsbridge taken a century later.

0812550706|5.0|Initially I had no desire to read Ender's Game. I'm not a very big fan of science fiction and the thought of pre-teens in space fighting aliens didn't really appeal to me. After the urgings of my law school friend, okay actual friend, Melissa (=P) I decided to give this novel a try and boy am I glad I did! I actually can't believe I put off reading this for so long.<br /><br />Ender's Game follows Ender Wiggins as he is plucked from his childhood home, loaded on to a space ship, and enters Battle School in case of an attack by the buggers, alien life forms that attacked Earth but were successfully repelled. At Battle School Ender is the youngest but he is constantly put in situations he doesn't appear equipped to handle. Ender has to overcome isolation, loneliness, fatigue, and other psychological endeavors in order to become the person society needs him to be.<br /><br />Does it make me a bad person if I say I enjoyed reading about Ender's struggles? Ender is so young and yet he has to deal with so much. His character goes through so many turning points that I felt like I was growing up right along with Ender, readying for battle and defending against the buggers. The novel was completely engrossing and action packed. Saying that it was all action though belittles the plot itself. The story is about so much more then action, it is also ripe with political commentary, personal fears about turning in to someone we don't want to be, and lessens on what it means to be a living being and a leader.<br /><br />The supporting cast was just as amazing as Ender himself I loved Ender's platoon and how those around him followed Ender and accepted him as their leader despite his age. Even if the other characters could not be his friends they still respected and admired Ender. This fact made me both happy and sad. I was happy to see Ender finding success but I was sad to see a very young boy without any friends to support and love him. This is something I feel a lot of career driven people have to deal with and I liked that parallel.<br /><br />I must also say that the technology described in Ender's Game was phenomenal. This novel was originally published in the 80's and yet there was something akin to the internet, tablets, all manner of futuristic devices that are still futuristic despite this novel being written almost 30 years ago! This impressed me because I think it shows the depth of Card's world building, he was truly immersed in this society.<br /><br />I understand that at present there is controversy surrounding Orson Scott Card, the author, and while I do not agree with his personal opinions I really enjoyed this novel. The originality, and intricacy of the plot surprised me and I'm so glad Melissa talked me in to reading this novel! I am now super excited for the movie which is coming out November 1, 2013iven people have to deal with and I liked that parallel.<br /><br />I must also say that the technology described in Ender's Game was phenomenal.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I HAVE NEVER READ 3 books in a week. But I couldn't put this series down. I love me some Christian Grey.
B000002J6H|5.0|I lost my original version and ordered the remastered CD and I'm glad that I lost the first one. I honestly don't remember hearing the music with this much clarity. Maybe my original vinyl was simply worn out from so many plays. This is one of my favorite albums from Stephen Stills. His voice doesn't sound this good anymore, sadly. Hendrix plays on Old Times Good Times (shortly before his death); Clapton on Go Back Home. Very happy with the remastered version.
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|It's hard to contemplate that Mavis Staples is approaching 75 and still performing. This album, produced by Jeff Tweedy is unbelievably good, one of those laid back CDs that has to be listened as a whole and which works as a whole. Mavis can wrap her voice anything - from the Staples Singers  on VeeJay and Stax through being a solo artist for the last 35 years. This one's a keeper.
B00BESCJII|5.0|Much better than I expected...great flick!  This film is not just for teenagers; my husband and I enjoyed it as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it  so fun great way to waste time!!!!!!!!!! But my app just disappeared and i had to redownload this app
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This is a great movie and there is nothing we would change. We have seen it many times and will probably watch a lot more.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is awesome and there is an underworld ,well that's what my brother and I call it . I have the inventory editor for minecraft so it makes it even easier to get stuff without mining. I love this game because it's cool . But I did have a problem that I had died . Except for that I would say it was a great game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Truly wonderful ending... Everything tied up and with a happy ever after :-) loved this series, witting, sexy, great story line and great characters.... Wish to read more point of view from christen
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I'm one if those people who like to read a book before I see the movie. I'm so glad I did this time too. Now I'm gonna go watch the movie.
0316247545|5.0|This is a solid and very complete book. At least all the way up to current season 3. I'd liked to have seen more background ponies listed, or better yet a more comprehensive list of ponies. They only dedicate 4 pages to Ponyville, 2 to Canterlot and 2 to Cloudsdale. They show Derpy, but she has no name or details. Not that I don't know who she is, but she should have been listed with a name. They cover a wide range of input from the creators and others involved in making the show. This to me was very interesting as I really enjoy the perspective of all the people involved in making it great. They have all the songs, even the short jingles, so you can sing along accurately now!<br /><br />One odd thing, to me, is that the book is actually quite small. I didn't think it would be as small as it is (the pictures make it look bigger for some reason). The construction is not bad really, and the front/back cover are decently made. The book feels solid and well bound. I've found a few pages where the ink has slightly so ever caught (leaving a small line of ink). But it is so miniscule its hardly worth noting.<br /><br />Get this book if your a fan, or a Brony or whatever. Its fun, interesting and should be on your shelf if you enjoy ponies that talk and have friendship adventures. :)
B002LLDTA4|5.0|I am thoroughly amazed that this video footage even exists.  It is uncanny that it is now available in Blu-ray.  If you enjoy Leonard Cohen this is essential and seeing him with the handsome good-looks of his youth makes me appreciate how well this gentleman has aged like a fine wine.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Anyone hear of the app called Tiny Monsters? Well this is almost a spitting image of that app except far more well done and with Dragons instead of cat-like monsters. A prime example of how the Tiny Monsters app should have been but failed to be. The people are Backflip Studios did a great job one-upping the creators of Tiny Monsters.<br /><br />It's the kind of app where it does take time to do things but you don't have to constant check in it. The money earned from your dragons piles up until you go to collect it. You do need to buy and collect food considering it only makes a specific amount until you buy more but I have no problem with that. It looks great, Game play is incredibly simply yet still fun, and it's cool to see how all the different dragons mix together. Also, unlike the Tiny Monsters game, you don't have to break the bank in order to remove items (rocks and trees) from the area you own (mind you it has to be clear in order to place the dragons/structures). Again, It takes all the bad things about the app that it's based on and fixes pretty much all of it.<br /><br />My only complaint is the lack of originality. Aside from the different graphics style, structures, and dragons instead of monsters, It's pretty much the same game. I'd like to see more originality come to the app through updates - Maybe add some unique structures and stuff like that. Sort of separate itself from the app it was based on.<br /><br />Overall, It's a fun app to play and the people who created Tiny Monsters would do well to use DragonVale as a guide for how their app should be. Well done Backflip Studios, Well done.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Wonderful movie with lots of excitement. Great storyline leading up to the Wizard of Oz. Something I know my grandchildren will enjoy.
B0070UFMOW|4.0|Firstly, I said FIRSTLY. Wait to buy this if you have high quality headphones coming. Listen to them first, and then decide.<br /><br />I got a pair of AKG K702's and they do sound excellent. BUT I don't know if this thing is worth the money. It does have some features that I do like. A bass setting, a treble setting, a balance setting and a gain setting. Useful if you like more bass out of reference headphones (like me). It also has a decent run life, but I tend to run it in one place consistently. I can see what others are saying about the screen never sleeping (unless you flick the HOLD button). It is annoying if your using the amp to control your volume (I use the devices volume button to dictate this, I've got the amp at full volume).<br /><br />I'd say the amplification is fine, and getting back to my original recommendation I can honestly say wait. Listen to your new cans and see if they get loud enough. I've found that while the bigger cans do need more power to really pump, they do run well with stock built in amps. HOWEVER, this is not a reason to want to amp your cans. There are hosts of sites saying 'You will not get the full spectrum of your headphones without a good amp'. I really think this plays into THAT persons personal preferences. There are so many people that don't know what good sound sounds like, that this is partially true. BUT again, listen to what you get, and then decide. Would I buy another amp? Yes. Would it be a fiio? No, simply because for what it does it seems way overpriced for its function.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a good and you should try it.It is very very very very fun game that's what I think of it.
B001FA0W5W|1.0|Just not my thing...<br /><br />I don't believe in luck and I'm not sure who gave me this book to read but I'll be honest - it's always going to gather dust sitting on the shelf. It goes against the grain of my Christian beliefs that nothing happens by luck or chance.
B00CFA222M|5.0|Great movie! I gave it to my 10 year old grandson and he thought it was fantastic. I will watch it again.
B008XG1X18|4.0|The Pinterest app. works great on.my Kindle Fire. I love the ease of use and it loads fast. It's a nice,portable way to look at my favorite things.
0345529057|5.0|These are great books, I picked them up after already watching the show and wow, they are almost exactly the same. Sometimes word for word with the show.  I like them, they are good addicting reads.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was a good book, but not my favorite. I guess I expected more from the #1 National Bestseller. It was suspenseful with an interesting plot, but it just didn't strike my fancy.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I got my Chromecast from amazon yesterday. I ordered it as soon as it became available on amazon as was not willing to pay $3.99 for shipping on Google Play :)<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Setup - its a simple setup. It took me longer (15 mins) since I have a Apple Airport Express router and had to update its firmware. \\"Airport Utility\\" app on ipad and iphone sucks and crashes them. For Windows users download here: [...]<br />  Once I updated chromecast connected immediately. Before that it was not connecting.<br />- Youtube, Netflix - \\"casting\\" from desktop and iOS (iPhone apps) works smoothly.<br />- Chrome Browser Casting: this also works great...was able to watch videos from various sites without any issues. Saves me a lot of time and effort when I had to hook up HDMI cable from TV to laptop.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Lack of apps but I am guessing Google is already working on this given the response from consumers.<br /><br />All in all a great, simple to use product that delivers what it is intended for. I am just waiting for my netflix code that will make this an even better deal :)
B00CP4RZIO|5.0|So new lineup, except for hunter, most people won't even hear the difference.  This is the most cohesive album since the black album.  When i say cohesive i mean every song has a very specific feel without sounding repetitive, not a common trait on chimaira albums, usually theyre songs are all ovr the place.Very dark, and heavy as hell this is like infection 2.0 new and improved.  I admit I wasn't a huge fan of infection but I always loved the tone of it, after aoh I wasn't sure they would revisit that sound, apparently they read my mind.  Absolute must have album don't waste time grabbing this!!!
0743289692|3.0|Started reading it, got half way through after taking a lot of breaks. Interesting, but slow reading. I still want to finish it though. Are there cliff notes for it out there?
B000VZYPB4|5.0|My brother recommended me to watch this show and I'm glad I did! It's very funny!!  I bought the 1st season on amazon prime and I'm looking forward on watching season 2.

B0097EWK3A|3.0|Was fun better than their other games but too short. I also don't like how they all say free but then make you pay if you want to continue. It's definitely fun while it lasts though.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in a while. Great action and scenes. I love, love, loved it!
0792165020|4.0|If you have watched the original version from France (Plein soleil aka Purple Noon, 1960, with Alain Delon as Ripley and Maurice Ronet as Dickie Greenleaf) first, then you might not be as thrilled with this remake. Actually it's the 2nd remake (Dennis Hopper played Tom Ripley in Wim Wenders'\\"The American Friend\\", ca.1977), but I like it a lot better than the Wim Wenders remake from 1977.<br />Matt Damon's Tom Ripley is more watchable than Wim Wenders' Ripley.<br />Also it's longer than the first French version and contains more scenes from the novel.<br />But there was no character called  Meredith in the novel. I wonder why she was invented by the screen writer for the second remake?
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Funny, clever, touching. Steve Carrell is great as villain Gru. But it's the minions who steal the show, and 3 young orphans who steal your heart in this instant classic.
0547848412|5.0|After I saw this movie, I knew I had to read the book, and I was so right.  There is much more in the book than the movie could ever include.  It is a fascinating read written with the silky and smooth poetical language that only this author could have written.  I can't wait to read more of his stories
0307460444|4.0|Yes, is Martha Stewart's. what can I say?<br />She is the best in this art and make it see so easy. is a complete book with all kind of techniques and great photos and a lot of useful advices. from the most basic until the the most elaborate. is a book that makes you want to get cooking now!
B003UYV08E|5.0|Great great movie, and product. I received it in 2 days and it was perfectly new. Overall I can't complain, and I recommend this movie a lot.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Says I need an update to continue playing. Tried everything even just starting all over and it still won't let me play
B00DHNJCKQ|3.0|The movie was OK, definitely glad I rented it before buying it. Action scenes were lacking with the exception of the last. Movie was gray and dull. None of the characters were memorable. Storyline is non-existent. Mans family is killed man seeks revenge.

B00821OX98|5.0|Realistic?  Maybe...  Civilians doing better than the military?  Probably not.  But it is interesting and well written.  It's fun to see the character development.  Even my wife likes it - and she doesn't do sci-fi.
B006YC74E8|5.0|really enjoyed working with this app.  easy to understand. several great finishing options and edits for photos and easy to learn
B0011ZNAIC|1.0|We just opened this and watched it. It is so funny. While I would defiantly not quote some of the information in the movie as scientifically factual this is a great movie that explores some great topics. Super fun and a great movie.<br />After watching this movie for a few months this DVD will no longer play in the DVD player and I can not return it. :( Would not purchase again. Full of digital artifact.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This is a fictional tale that bares the weight of man's actions on his own soul. Sin always finds you out.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I enjoyed this game. It is similar to Temple Run. I don't like that you have to be connected to Facebook in order to advance though.. I had to replace my Kindle because it wouldn't charge. Now I cannot reconnect to Facebook because I have already given this app &quot;permission.&quot; This means goal wise I am stick because they are all related to friends.... This game has been uninstalled.

B00DU74U74|5.0|I read the book and although there are some changes most of the story was transferred. It was a feel good movie with a happy ending. I enjoyed it.
013168728X|3.0|This book starts with the assumption that you know virtually no math and then builds from background tutorials into the depths of image processing.  Slow going if you've got a stronger background, but it gets there eventually.  Exceptionally clear and approachable.

B006LSZECO|5.0|An easy read that grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the book!  The alternating chapter &#34;point of view&#34; maintained the story line and moved me easily through the complex plot!  A must read!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great blend of soapy drama and procedural drama.  Great ensemble of actors who get to play complicated, multi-dimensional characters.  Watch it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|its cool I love it really a challenging game make more levels that's all I have to say otherwise this is a great game
B000P0J09M|1.0|i ordered the goodfellas dvd for the purpose of watching the movie now being a movie fan and dvd collecter this was a big deal. sadly the dvd just stopped in the middle of it i thought the first one i got was was just a mistake so i ordered a new one. the same thing happened. the movie itself is great but the dvd was disapointing
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Who doesn't like the Breaking Bad series, it's edgy, sinister and sucks you into the story. But remember you need to start form the beginning of this story to get the true feeling of what happens and why. Having lived through the 60's I have seen people that easily fit into the characters of this story. It is scary that such people exist but life is full of viciousness and men that don't care about anything but their own version of how to live and treat other people. This is a story about people who teeter on the edge of both worlds and how they manage to slip off one side or the other and back again. You learn to hate them and to have sympathy for them but then realize it was their choice that lead them down the rabbit hole. Like dominoes, one thing leads to another and before you know it you are plugging yourself into the story line, good luck with your out come.
0316224588|5.0|I've read a number of Ian Rankin books and this is my favorite so far.  Lively, interesting characters.  Hard to put this book down.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|My daughter recommended it. I enjoyed the movie good mix no sex, violence and not a horror movie. Great movie.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|Before I Go To Sleep had a cool premise, a woman has a rare kind of amnesia where she forgets everything every morning when she wakes up. She keeps a journal to keep track of her day to day activities.<br /><br />Sadly its the aforementioned diary that makes the book a chore to finish. Christine has the personality of a dead fish. She is supposedly a published author but her diary is the same from day to day:<br /><br />Wake up<br />Wonder who she is in bed with.<br />Go the the bathroom or look down and become shocked she isn't young.<br />Her husband explains what is wrong with her.<br />He goes to work.<br />Her shrink calls and tells her where her diary is hidden.<br />Read the journal.<br />Meet with her doctor.<br />Eat dinner with her husband.<br />Goes to bed early and writes in her diary.<br />Hides journal<br />Goes to sleep.<br />And so on..<br /><br />The journal is 60% of the book and it slows the \\"mystery\\" to a crawl. The first 20% and last 20% is far more interesting than the bulk (journal) of the book. As for the \\"mystery\\" its projected early and the hints are so heavy handed any reader shouldn't be shocked by the ended.<br /><br />I also had major issues with the author's \\"female voice\\". He doesn't have one. All of the female characters don't ring true. You can tell the author is male. No woman describes sex and the naked body as the main character does..<br /><br />If you must read it I suggest reading the first and last 20% but skim through the journal. You won't miss much.

B000IU3XTW|5.0|Great performance from the Foo. Nice to look back and see them in a mellow setting. These guys can rock stadiums and festivals like no other as well as keep it intimate. One of the great bands of the last 20 years and Dave Grohl could be the greatest rock 'n roller ever.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Lots of action, Special effects I woudl give a C but otherwise a good plot. It is fairly new so the picture was very good.

B000TGJ8AS|5.0|This is a season of on-going story lines<br />Gibbs could not be allowed to retire and the first couple of shows bring him back to active duty.<br />This season has several strong individual episodes.<br />Witch Hunt has the famous Abby as Marylyn Monroe at Halloween.<br />The episodes Once a Hero, Driven, Dead Man Walking and Smoked are excellent stand-alone stories.<br />Twisted Sister and Friends & Loves present a McGee in a new light and are major steps in this characters development.<br />Their are a number of story lines, some major and some just fun, in this season.<br />Special Agent Lee and Jimmy have several encounters in less than appropriate places lending some comic relief.<br />The publication of McGee's first book has some team members upset with how their portrayal.<br />The decision to retire creates problems for Gibbs; Tony became team leader and is involved in special projects for the director.  These are ongoing stories during the season as problems are \\"resolved\\".<br />Tony falls in love.<br />Director Sheppard establishes her authority and hate for an arms dealer known as \\"La Grenouille\\".<br />The producers call this the \\"season of secrets\\" and season five the \\"season of answers\\".
140006922X|5.0|An amazing historical journey to early Jerusalem with all the turbulence, chaos and politics that led to the creation of the Christian religion. For the open minded it is a truly wonderful education into the people and times of Jesus of Nazareth. Extremely well written and compelling. A must read!
B00785P2QC|4.0|its fun but hard to tap things but over all really fun and the trucks sometimes glitches out so I have to buy a new one
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Sigh No More sort of turned me off to Mum&Sons...They have such a great sound, but I just couldn't get into their debut album. However, Babel has changed my opinion of them greatly.<br /><br />Lyrics are great. Melodies are great. Obviously &#34;I Will Wait&#34; speaks to my heart and reminds me of the love I have for my wife.<br /><br />All in all, a great album that I will enjoy over and over again!
B00908DDZM|5.0|I fell in love with this album after hearing several songs on the radio. Macklemore made me want to know more about his journey. I initially thought Ryan Lewis was just another producer like so many others, but after listening to the music I saw that his name is deserving of its place in the title. There are some very well orchestrated hip hop beats on this album, but there are also some surprisingly delicate and mood setting melodies. They are both two of the best that I have heard in a long time. Beautifully done.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is very addictive and challenging but not to challenging it's a very fun game to play.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Nonbelievers and believers should read this book. Belief based on ignorance or prejudice is not faith&#34;. Denying evolution and Darwin in this age is pitiful.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it! I feel like I'm there.. I don't want to put it down! Great trilogy! Can't wait to start on more of her work.
140006922X|1.0|This is an area in which I am very interested and so, based upon some of the positive reviews, I approached the book with an open mind as I am more interested in knowing the truth than in blindly following dogma. However, on the first page of the introduction, I found an assertion that was very troubling. The author quotes the Greek philosopher Celsus as an authority on Jewish figures who \\"farcically\\" claimed to be messiahs at the time of Jesus of Nazareth. Left unmentioned is the fact that Celsus wrote a century and a half after Jesus' death and was primarily known as an anti-Christian polemicist. His writings were, in fact, refuted by various contemporaries for their baseless claims without any historical evidence. Given that the author quotes such a polemicist as an authority on the first page of his introduction means that many of his other claims must be met with suspicion.<br /><br />This is not the careful, historical balance that was promised in those positive reviews!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Really fun variation on the classic game - not just for golf fans!<br />Very interesting way to score the game
1401307450|5.0|This was a really good read. It took a little time to finish it, but it was worth it. I am a huge fan of RHCP and I definitely recommend to anyone else that is as well.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Now this is the way to do &#34;superhero&#34; movies! Nolan's entire trilogy is a masterpiece. I've seen this movie multiple times, but owning the Blu-ray makes it that much more pleasurable. From the acting, to the story, to the action, to the soundtrack, to the cinematography--a feast for the senses. And I'm a sucker for Liam Neeson.
B000IMKDPC|5.0|If you are into the wolverine then you will love this movie. I went and watched them all before i went to see the new one.
B003N7ORNI|5.0|This book had me reading constantly it was so good that I then went on to read the rest of the series!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|this book was very nice to read, even though it was made in 1900. i highly recommend it. very nice.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Thoughtful exposure of one,s past.  Language flowed on with depth of feeling. I do recommend this book to anyone looking for adventure thru the eyes of a real person
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Wow, Google, you keep amazing me in so many ways! Actually, as I'm writing this review I'm watching Breaking Bad through Netflix! Luckily I beat the cut and scored the 3 months free of it. Anywho, this thing is a cinch to set up, however, make sure that you have a strong network (internet) connection and you're not far from your router. Nice clear picture, I can't wait to see what the future brings with this device.
B008JFUREC|3.0|Smurfette is taken by Gargamel to Paris where he is now a popular illusionist \\"with the help from his magic wand.\\" He wants her to tell him how Papa Smurf made her blue, so he can make the pale Smurfs he made, blue. Then he can use their essence for even more powerful magic.<br />  Papa, Vanity, Grumpy and Clumsy come to the rescue and recruit Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) to help, for no good reason. Unfortunate to Patrick, his step-dad Victor (Brendan Gleason) wants to tag along. Victor means well but always messes up. While Smurfette starts thinking of Gargamel and his 2 creations as family, thinking the Smurf's don't want her since she thinks the Smurfs forgot her Birthday.<br />  Just like the first, the movie is mildly amusing. But despite Neil Patrick Harris and Brendan Gleason having good scenes together their characters weren't necessary.  The movie taking place in Paris was pretty pointless too. The movie was okay I think, but the show is still much much much much better. Since the show show was a fantasy/adventure. Not a goofy comedy/fantasy with the Smurfs constantly in the real world site seeing in NY and Paris.<br />  If a part 3 is made, they need to just stay in the Smurf land, have new villains and friends from the show, like Big Mouth and Hagatha and have Yo Han and Pee Wee instead of Neil Patrick Harris and Gargamel. We don't need Smurfs 3 in Japan or Iraq.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. I Can't wait for the next season.  I stayed up all night watching the entire season!
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Love it! Really got the set for a very good price. I wish there were bloopers & interview (like they've got in the Blu-Ray releases) yet alas, will have to wait for those prices to go down!  Great for any STNG fan who watches the episodes over, and over, and over, and over again. like me!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think this game is a lot of fun, although it does remind me of Subway Surfers.  I like the fights the most.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I would recommend this show.  Each episode is well written and acted.  The stories made you laugh and cry.  The story lines draw you into each character and their lives.  I look forward to watch the next seasons.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love this show.  It is good drama and always different.  It's pretty clean with only a few issues but they seem to feel badly when they do immoral things, gotta like that.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Great CD! With your great time machine brain you can go back to camping on the beaches in California and hear the  records playing the Beach Boy songs, seems like yesterday. Great way to remember some of the best times of your life.
B005N09L5C|2.0|I know it's a clich&eacute;, but the book is MUCH better.  The movie is slow, sad, and tedious.  Skip this if you value your time.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I'm not even sure how many times I've read this book. An total classic in the SF genre, and the best of the series; if you stop after reading this, you are safe (Children of Dune and Dune Messiah are worth reading as well, but you can definitely stop after that). Epic space opera storyline.
B00407PNWO|3.0|When reviewing old movies like 1938's \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\", the reviewer must decide whether to critique the movie based on the era in which it was released or solely upon one's modern viewing experience. I'm going to largely review this classic version of Robin Hood according to the latter.<br /><br />I do like Errol Flynn in the title roll. He exudes such a joie de vivre (\\"joy of living\\") in contrast to Costner's dour performance and Crowe's dead serious approach. Flynn's rendition comes across as a Medieval superhero with superhuman nonchalance and bravery, not to mention fighting skills. One sequence shows Robin Hood taking on a whole castle of armed foes and easily escaping. I have no problem with this -- superheroes are great -- but it does mark the film as more of a Medieval fantasy rather than a quasi-realistic historical picture.<br /><br />Olivia de Havilland is also great as Maid Marion. She has a lovely face and such a winsome spirit. The pompous villains are excellent as well. As for Robin's merry men, they're serviceable.<br /><br />The film is very colorful and energetic, but sometimes the dialogue comes across so rehearsed. The characters speak so quickly and without inflection that it often doesn't even register what they said until a few seconds after they speak. Maybe it's just the way actors delivered their lines back then but, regardless, this'll strike modern viewers as bad filmmaking and acting.<br /><br />One scene is very eye-rolling -- when Marion comes into Robin's camp in Sherwood forest and his merry men start dancing hand-in-hand. Alrighty then.<br /><br />As far as the score goes, I'm sure it was fine for 1938, but for modern listeners it's verging on atrocious.<br /><br />Still, it's surprising how much \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" holds up and remains entertaining. It's a great film when you want a pleasant flash from the past. But it doesn't hold a candle to more modern Medieval films, like \\"Tristan & Isolde\\" and \\"Black Death\\". And Costner and Crowe's more realistic versions are all-around better, even while they're less vibrant. But, again, the 1938 version is great when you're in the mood for a more energetic and colorful viewing experience.<br /><br />The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in California (they do a pretty good job of trying to make Southern California look like England).<br /><br />GRADE: C+ or B-Death\\". And Costner and Crowe's more realistic versions are all-around better, even while they're less vibrant. But, again, the 1938 version is great when you're in the mood for a more energetic and colorful viewing experience.<br /><br />The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in California (they do a pretty good job of trying to make Southern California look like England).<br /><br />GRADE: C+ or B-
B008FPZQRO|3.0|Most surround sound mixes have about 80% of the mix in front and 40% in the rear with a 20% overlap. This mix seems to be more spread out which is fine, but the reverb is usually more effective in the rear channels. In this mix, the reverb is kind of heavy in the front channels, more than I would prefer. Perhaps the reverb is married to the vocal tracks and there was nothing that could change their placement. What's more there are sections where the organ is effected with reverb and then suddenly the reverb is diminished (i.e. \\"Manticore\\"). Maybe that's how it is on the original master and it's just more noticeable in the high resolution mix.<br /><br />There is an extra chord at the end of the progression leading up to the organ solo in \\"Stones of Years\\". Usually in 5.1 remixes, the changes are more subtle, but  there were compromises that had to be made in the process of mixing everything from scratch, much like the ending of \\"Knife Edge\\" from the self titled album.<br /><br />It's not what I would have expected from a surround remix, but I am impressed with the clarity of the high resolution. I was hoping that the new mixes would give us the definitive version of Tarkus, but I still feel that the original Atlantic/Victory/Rhino releases remain so.<br /><br />With this edition you get two tracks that were left off the original album, one of which I like titled \\"Oh My Father\\".
B000FC130E|4.0|perfect beach book, not so engrossing you read for hours at a time but it does compel you to read when at hand.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season one was great but season two was fantastic. I loved every episode. Without a doubt you must get all three seasons and watch it before Jan. 5th 2014 when the next season starts.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read the third one and for the movie to hit the theaters.  I'll be in line to see it.

0062255657|5.0|I recommended this book to a friend with particular tastes, and was delighted to find out The Ocean at the End of the Lane satisfied those tastes very well. My reading is a bit more eclectic, and I continue to recommend the book highly! Magical without being syrupy, childlike observations that ring true, and adult themes to ponder after reading is finished make for a very satisfying summer read. Gaoman's observations about vegetables are one example of truthful observation to continue to ponder. Delightful and thought provoking.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I love quentin tarintino movies, so i just has to have this in my collection. Very good for it being used.

B005LAII08|3.0|THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE BLU-RAY ITSELF AND NOT OF THE MOVIE, BRAVE (which deserves 5/5 stars)<br /><br />This was one of the first Blu-Rays we purchased to go with our new player. So far, it is the only one that doesn't work. The disc appears to be in fine condition (no scratches or blemishes), but skips and freezes whenever we try to play it. The DVDs in the collection work fine, but we wanted the Blu-Ray. Since we purchased this as a Christmas gift, by the time it was opened, and discovered to not be working, the return window had expired. Too Bad.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|My assessment: THE best album from the Legend himself. For the production qualities, the songs and of course his vocals and guitar work, this is an inspiration. If you buy one Buddy Guy recording, this one should be it. The Blues are still alive and well! Congratulations Buddy!

B004H1V5RU|4.0|This is the second Perplexus ball I have purchased for my son. It is one of the very few things besides video games that holds his interest. This particular ball, though, has proven to be frustrating for him at times as the level of difficulty is quite high (as described). Still, after cooling off for a while, he keeps going back to it. I am very pleased with this purchase.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Like many others, I was a fan of the last version and hats the current version.  In an attempt to look unique they lost their main purpose: to deliver the weather quickly and clearly.  Many problems including the inability to reload even with the reload button added back in.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I really enjoy this mahjong series but hadn't played for a few weeks so I was very surprised when I found they had changed it. I was able to play only a limited amount of layouts as compared to prior and I have played this for two years. Now they have \\"treasure chests\\" and the layouts are available in the first two but from then on you have to purchase each treasure chest for 99¢. This is just so wrong for so many reasons!!<br /><br />Still a great series but WHAT THE HECK!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got hooked on Downton Abbey when it was on channel Thirteen. It's great for someone who enjoys drama and global history!
B000YDOOUK|3.0|Great group with strong rock roots.  Music does not hold up well long-term, like a VH or AC/DC song, but still can be cranked up to 20 and rock the HOUSE!
B00AZMFO9U|4.0|This is a humorous, warmhearted film that ends well for all concerned.  I greatly enjoyed seeing actors and musicians from my younger years still active.  And it's too bad we all can't end our days in such luxury.  But the adding machine in my head suggests that you'd have to shell out a few hundred thousand up front and come up with at least five thousand a month thereafter, if you could even find such a place.  My experience is that in America, retirement homes are wedged into the cityscape and offer little green space outside and only modest elbow room inside.  They're built to maximize income per square foot.  The chair-lift on Beecham House's grand staircase offered a hint of reality, however.
B00563M11M|5.0|Pratchett always delivers, excitement, fun and lots of laughs.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this as well as any of his Diskworld books

B00BXVKKPA|3.0|AIRBOURN is my new guilty pleasure.  They remind me of QUIET RIOT or MOTLEY CREW in that I didn't take them seriously as rockers, but they have some good riffs and some songs that stick with you.  I like it turned up to 20!
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|There are no really interesting villains to inspire audience antipathy, and the film has almost no plot to take up screen time.  So the car chases have time to develop their full richness and subtlety.  But, alas, we lead off with a long sequence in which a giant military truck roars down the street, using its size to destroy any vehicles in its way.  This occurs early in the film, and seems almost wasted without some setup time to develop our interest in the participants.  Anyway, there's no fun in seeing a heavyweight beat up on a flyweight.  Later, I recall someone driving an SUV down a crowded street on top of the other cars, which is a much more amusing take on car chases.  Or that may be in a Jason Bourne film I saw at about the same time.  Anyway, lots of cars were sacrificed in making this film.  Diehard fans should find the whole thing okay but not as good as the other flicks in the series.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this app/game its really addicting because of how fun it is. I mean i had this app/game for a yea and a half and it never gets old new dragons here and there and habbitats. you also get to rase your dragons and feed them and mate them to create new dragons without paying for one. Like i said i LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.
B008XBASVY|4.0|Loved this book. Colfer did well!! Wish it were longer. I hope the movie version of this book is as good as this is!
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|All my friends are reading Nesbo this year.  They loved Stieg Larsson so much I think it may have dulled their senses.  I just couldn't get into this book.  A girl has been killed - wow, hardly ever see THAT in a thriller - it's taking FOREVER to get clues about her death.  Meanwhile Harry has a little dalliance with the first, or maybe only Nordic girl he's met in Austrailia (or is it South Africa? I can't even remember).  By now I'm snoring....  Where is the fast paced, page-turning excitement of Larsson?  Or the sensitive insight of T. Jeff Parker?  Or the wild ride Lee Childs gives you?  They're wherever the clues are to this boring murder mystery.<br />I may, just MAY, mind you, give this guy another chance.  Maybe in this first Harry Hole book (and how do you pronounce that?<br />HOLE?  HOU-LAY?) he hadn't yet hit his stride.  But this one, in the end, I just couldn't read.  Sorry.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Great Cd!! If you love JT you'll love this new album. I have it on repeat my husband isnt to happy but im pleased!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is like so fun and it is almost as popular as minecraft!!!! ^_^  &hearts;&hearts;★  i am so random!
0812982622|4.0|Knowing Korean culture since 1980, Johnson weaves outrageous violence to the point of turning other than Koreans away, soured by the vulgar stupidity & double minded ness allowing such gruesome actions to occur. Although the writing challenges the reader to piece the characterization together, as characters are left timeless in the discussion, very impressed how Dr. Song is remembered by Wanda in closing. The dog Brando is cleverly used to depict the ambiguous nature of human choices. The ORPHAN MASTERS SON takes its place in rightfully explaining the wrong.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Did not like the subject matter.  Only read it because it was recommended.<br />This is a matter of taste.  But I finished it, which says something good about the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy escape the room games. This one is fun. Pretty easy but some challenges. Worth the download! thank you
B0054VVRBQ|1.0|The card worked on earlier versions of OSX, but locks everything up on my MacBook pro now that it's running 10.8.4:  I have to hard reboot in order to get the computer functional again.  The company's website only provides drivers for \\"MacOS 10.7.4 or before\\".
B007RE0SCW|5.0|I ordered this as a present for my daughter for her birthday.  The shipping was fast and there was no damage to the box the doll came in.  The only thing is that the box the order was shipped in could have been a bit more sturdy and taped a bit better.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|An easy read, fun, and enlightening! Kept me on my toes and gave me a lot to think about! Recommended!
B0072QPV6I|5.0|The Chemical Brothers are in the top league with their big beats, and this concert captures the frantic pace and excitement perfectly.<br /><br />Electronic dance music doesn't come better than this - a great concert with great sound and great visuals.<br /><br />It's amusing to see members of the crowd react to the trippy visuals.<br /><br />This concert DVD / bluray disc gets a big bonus point for keeping that shaky-cam nonsense to a minimum.  Camera effects and video post-production effects are kept to a relative minimum so they never intrude.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|It was a lot of fun watching the old MacGyver episodes from so long ago. Clean innocent tv with good morals that's still entertaining.
0670026638|4.0|Quite an engaging piece of metafiction, that examines the concept of time through the use of the author as a character in her own story interfacing with the narrative of a Japanese girl Nao. The lines between autobiography and fiction becomes blurred when Ruth (the character) finds Nao's diary cleverly concealed beneath the covers of Proust's \\"In Search of Lost Time\\", along with some letters and a broken watch encased in a Hello Kitty lunchbox. The contents are protected by a barnacle-encrusted freezer bag that gets washed up on the shores off an remote island in British Columbia, aptly called Desolation Sound. The timing of Ruth's find falls ominously right after the 2011 tsunami.<br /><br />As Ruth becomes more involved in Nao's diary, the entries also become interwoven with Ruth's narrative as we come to learn more about the circumstances that led to the former Manhattanite's move to Desolation Sound with her partner, Oliver. Nao anticipates a future reader of her diary, and Ruth takes on this persona up to a point where Nao appears to be writing Ruth into being. On the other hand, Ruth feels like she could and should act to prevent certain tragedy from happening to Nao and her suicidal father, amidst Nao's entries on her miserable school and home life. Past and present, fiction and reality, they all become conflated as the relationship between two people who never meet takes on an urgency that the reader inexplicably shares and believes.<br /><br />It's all rather complicated, but Ozeki (the author) ensures the interaction across time and space works through the rather clear distinction between Nao's voice and the narrator's own. The author's background as a Zen Buddhist priest also helps when she expounds on 13th century Zen master Dogen's ideas about always being present and engaged, moment by moment.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I read this under the haze of drowse-inducing meds during a upper-respiratory tract infection that saw me alternating between the dreamlike sequences of the novel and my own; which may or may not be a good thing.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a good app, perfect for relaxing or using its large assortment of sounds to go to sleep.  I use it all the time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Entertaining - great characters - top of the line actors - good plot twists - outstanding location.  Can't wait for next season
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My husband purchased this kindle for my birthday.  I had previously bought a cheaper tablet that is not as easy to use.  I love my Kindle!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I was expecting a bit more description of his experience in the afterlife, but most of the book dealt with the more technical aspects of his coma.  It was interesting but not what I normally would purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I loved minecraft ever since I first played it on the xbox360. Although it doesn't have all the features as the xbox360 or the PC, it is cool. Mainly because it has the adventure of finding Herobrine, unlike the xbox360. IT IS WELL WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie as follows -<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />good addition to your collection of sci-fi movie.<br />storyline needed just that little topping to push it<br />up to 5 stars.<br />great video and audio throughout.<br />recommended.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|The most obvious question that burst through me at the end of viewing this movie is about why (on Earth!) such terrifically well made and played motion pictures slide under the US public's radar screen (?). 'Tis a pity because this is one of the better films made in the 21st century. It might even be Rene Zellweger's finest dramatic performance on screen. That it's based upon the true history of Beatrix Potter's life and writing career, during a period when younger women were considered property of parents (while unwed), and Zellweger most definitely plays Miss Potter as a shyly rebellious self-sufficient woman with extraordinary gifts of imagination and artistic skill, makes me question, I wonder how many other women, who were more everyday and less well celebrated during their lives, tip-toed on that tight rope between being property and being very independent.<br /><br />That's what watching this movie did for me. Thus, I would definitely have no problems with recommending it for any child, teen or adult. If they watch it and do not learn very significant historical and socially relevant truths from it, I'd be quite surprised.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Every human emotion is drawn out of you with the words in this book. You will love harder after reading it.
B00CVDM8QS|5.0|I truly love Dr Dawkins' work. I purchased three of these books, two to gift. Two out of the three readers recommend others read it. The book explains some of the most difficult questions about life in an easy to read way, that makes the reading not only fun but fulfilling. I wish I could find this book translated to Spanish so that I can send to my non-English reading family members.<br /><br />ALS
B0087YYHZU|5.0|I've been waiting to upgrade my VHS version to a Blu-ray version. This movie is just wonderful. I watch it at least once a year during the rainy season. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Conner are simply amazing dancers!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I am a sucker for these super hero comic crossover to movies, so my review might be a little biased.  This was an interesting collection of characters as far as the movie went.  When reading the comics, there is quite a bit more your imagination is used to fill in the blanks viruses the movie, which is more in your face with character to style of talking to personality all up to the actor and direction.  The comic version of the Avengers had more continuity due to my brain's concept of the characters.  Back to the movie, the the contrast of the characters was quite entertaining with SGT Fury and Iron Man's  charismatic and positive, with the more stiff and almost non-charismatic Thor and Captain America, in comparison.  The Hulk and Black Widow showed a more neutral character which blended better Iron Man and SGT Fury. As far as the story line goes it went well.  The kink in the story, as far as I am concerned, was the vehicle of choice, really??!?!  Nuff said.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|This game was awesome!-- for about a week. I opened it one day and it said an update was needed to log in. I even reinstalled it and it still didn't work. I would like this game 100 times better if they would fix this problem.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I like the way everyone's lives intersect in this book, and the way it makes you think about actions and consequences and the things you do for the people you love.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I am slowly updating my DVDs to Blu-ray. I really loved both the Harry Potter books and movies. The books are always better, but the collection of Harry Potter films are wonderful. Each movie has done a wonderful job at capturing the essence of the books. I will never get tired of watching these movies....and now in Blu-ray! Yippee!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome it reminds me of the movie it is so fun  when<br />You get to defeat the villains
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is so great that I am downloading it to my other devices. Fun and fast, reminds me of temple run but better. I feel this game hands down is a must own.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|I haven't even finished reading this book yet, but I absolutely love it.  the characters are colourful and the story interesting, and even if Allan's life story isn't exactly true, it does make you look at senior citizens in a different way!
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|I am slowly updating my DVDs to Blu-ray. I really loved both the Harry Potter books and movies. The books are always better, but the collection of Harry Potter films are wonderful.

B000G6R7B8|5.0|Bought one months ago (about a year, I think), as a gift for my husband, and he loves it. It's simple, with some military appeal, very light and the matte finish gives it a modern touch. My husband doesn't use it every day so, yes, he has to set date and time every time he takes it, but that's part of the charming of automatic watches, and this one works very well, retaining movement for up to almost two days without using it. Is not bulky, so if you are looking for big and prominent watches this one is not for you.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a must have game if you love WW2  or guns  this game is awesome and amazing if you have the first game you will love this game get this game now!
B002RI9A4U|5.0|Love it, typical Nick Hornby flowing story. He is always good where music and musicians are concerned, and I reckon he has relationships just right too.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Excellent acting, visual and story.  Didn't catch this originally and it is nice to know the background of the current season.
B006CHML4I|5.0|The first was in beige, for my husband and he loves it. So, when I thought about a gift for my brother, it seemed a good idea to look for a similar watch, and I found the same watch, but in blue, and it is perfect! Looks nicer than the photos, simple yet attractive, and works just fine. If it were a smaller version I'd buy one for me!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Another app for children of all ages, especially especially  those who are into car's or trucks . My grandkids all like this both boy's & girl's.  It takes practice as speed is a  factors  &  makes a difference how  you do on the course. They  get upset in the beginning but once it's mastered  watch out !!  They will want to play more often.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun game! Play it all the time I just love thoes minions. They are just tooo cute. Run minions run.
006178480X|5.0|The theories in this book are so excellent...a lot of what I actually believe of the universe and our existence.  It is an excellent Rollins book that keeps you wanting more.
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Killing Season was entertaining.Travolta and DNiro make good bad/good guy movie.started out a little slow but improved as the movie .A+
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is very addicting, in the same arena  as CANDY  CRUSH OR PET RESCUE.  Very full of fun, frustration,demanding skills & you still go back for more !!  You play alone but need support friends to get through the mazes .  Hardest part is finding who else play's so you get extra lives, moves or coins.  If you like the above mentioned app's you should like this one too. Just be prepared to waste what little free time you had , and that's a promise.
B002NY731U|3.0|I have to say I was kind of disappointed with this one too. I haven't really liked very much of their stuff since Countdown and Youthanasia. Rust in Peace was definitely their masterpiece so I guess where else did they have to go but down after that. It's not horrible, just not something I will listen to a whole lot but at least it was on sale when I got it.
B00CXG8Z1K|5.0|Wow...what an excellent compilation of Mr. Benson's portrayal of the great Mr. Nat King Cole.  Over the years, it seems like George's voice has developed some of the same \\"smokiness\\" as Nat's signature sound, making his renditions of Mr. Cole's tunes on this compilation appear eerily like a part of him has come back to revisit us here on earth.  How awesome is that?<br /><br />I've been a lifelong fan of the \\"King Cole\\", and have followed and enjoyed George Benson's career as well.  What a joyous combination of talent this cd possesses: Nat King Cole's music done in the inimitable Benson style, that only George can do best!
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|This movie was alright but it definitely wasn't Cruise's best by far or for that matter Freeman's either.Worth watching,it was entertaining.I would have given it a 3.5 if it was a choice but I'll let the 3 rating stand.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It's a good app except for all the ads and it's kinda slow. Add an inbox tab and actual channels, then it will be perfect.
B00BAB6CNC|3.0|I was really excited about this album's release but I have to say, I am kind of disappointed in it. It does not even compare to House of Gold and Bones part 1 in my opinion. It has some good songs but not like part 1. I liked the whole album of part 1 but this one probably won't get a whole lot of playing time in my rotation.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|It was hysterical! She is one of my favorite authors. I recommend all of her books! It's a great story I think everyone can relate to.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|My husband loves this movie...he wathed it many times... I would like to buy him more of the same type.. Thank you..
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I enjoyed the book until the last chapter. For the end of a trilogy there just wasn't  a completion on a story. I felt like I was left hanging.
B003VDZK8K|5.0|This was my first A7X album. I know a lot of people would probably give me shit over this but hearing their song Not Ready to Die was what introduced me to them in the first place while playing Black Ops. After I heard it I started looking them up because I had heard of them but hadn't really gotten in to any of the metal bands that came out around the time they did. Since getting this album though, I have since aquired all of their albums and am a huge A7X fan. I don't like all of their stuff but I do like the majority of it. The only song I don't really care for on this album is Danger Line. I don't know what it is but I can't make myself listen all the way through the song. Other than that though, the album is very good especially the songs like Nightmare, God Hates Us , Tonight the World Dies and Buried Alive.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|As a producer and composer I'm used to very high-end audio gear, but when it came to audio for live video, I was un-equipped. I bought this little rig, and was pleasantly surprised. Good sound quality, reasonable SNR, ergonomically well-thought out. In short, I can't imagine a better mic at this price point. The long cable is no big deal -- just coil and pocket it. No, it's not Sennheiser wireless or Countryman, but for the light-duty live video work I was doing, it was more than adequate.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|When I saw despicable me as a game on the kfhd, I turned to my wife to tell her that her favorite minion now had a game. Download was a breeze and we started playing. The facebook prompt came up, as it does with nearly every game nowadays, but we logged in and started playing. If you liked temple run/subway surfers, you should feel at home. Same controls as both, just new scenery. One of the main problems I ran into was the constant facebook-oriented missions. These became quite annoying almost to the point where I felt like deleting it. The only other gripe I have is with despicable me 2 out in theaters, why have they not updated the game to include the mall as a playable level? Two stages gets boring, which was the main reason I deleted the iron man game; that and outrageous iap's and grinding times. So if an update enables you to play the mall it gets 5 stars. Sure, you have powerups like in subway surfers and the ability to challenge friends on facebook, two stages just doesn't cut it. You decide.
0316228583|5.0|With nearly 4,000 reviews of the book, it is hard to say something new. I agree with the two \\"most helpful review\\" authors of the 4* and 5* reviews. The book is excellently crafted, and the characters are compelling. JK Rowling is a masterful writer. She takes a toxic brew of plus/minus 20 important characters, puts them in the pressure cooker of a small town in England's southwest (money and conservative politics), and turns up the heat. It's not a happy book, and pretty much all the characters are flawed. The heat and pressure bring out the worst.<br /><br />Some will fault the book on its elaborate physical descriptions of the characters and feel that the book could be shorter than 500 pages, but Rowling is painting a tightly focused and detailed picture with words. She needs the space to develop the photo.<br /><br />Others may find the characters too numerous and become frustrates because sometimes characters are called by their \\"familiar\\" names in addition to their first or last names. I found it useful to draw a character map to keep people straight until I got to know them better.<br /><br />There is lots of detail under the detail. For example, a less important character is Jolly (who isn't jolly). It's a mocking name that the family calls the daughter Suhkvinder, the rather slow and physically awkward daughter. Her mother berates her as lazy, and her father writes her off as someone not going to college. Jolly is dyslexic, and certainly bright enough (the reader will see she's no slouch), but neither her parents (physicians) nor the school's deputy headmaster or his guidance counselor wife do anything to assist her educational handicap. Jolly's parents are also oblivious as to how Jolly is ridiculed because of her facial hair which, according to reliable sources, is not uncommon in people of Indian descent.<br /><br />Clearly, the book is not for everyone, and you can see that by its numerical review scale.
B002361MLA|4.0|This is a great book to read especially if you feel that your mind needs assistance! It is a bit intellectual, but I enjoyed it for that reason as well as the spiritual discussions.
B000B8L6LI|4.0|Purchased this along with the sapphire stone as a present for my brother's birthday. I've been sharpening his knives for close to 20 years now. Although this system takes most of guess work out of sharpening, it's not idiot proof. Just remember that you are trying to create a burr on one side of the edge before moving on and you will get good results using this kit.
140006922X|5.0|I'd encourage skeptics to give it a try- approach it as history, not scripture, and appreciate what the book has to offer. I personally found the account of Jesus in Zealot much more identifiable than the way he's portrayed in all traditional Christian texts.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome u should totally get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /> Th e graphics are amazing! My horse is such a fun and easy-to-use game!!!!!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|i thought that this was an exceleent movie my daughter and i truely enjoyed this movie twoo thumbs up for sure
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. There were more grammatical errors than I would have liked, but not enough to really bother me. Can't wait for the next one.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I think Tina Fey is very funny on 30Rock, I was disappointed reading this book. Some parts gave me a good chuckle but overall it wasn't as funny as I was expecting
B000RLFJQ2|3.0|The plot and most of the car action was pretty unbelievable.  But we do have to remember that this movie was made in 1998 and doesn't have nearly the sophistication of today's technology.
B000XWJQF0|5.0|Simple but fun. If you're a tmnt fan you'll absolutely love it. The animation is great, the action is awesome, it's funny. It's the perfect mixture of dark and light hearted and it's a little less corny than the old movies.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great beginning that instantly draws the reader in...the middle gets a bit bogged down in battle description...but picks back up rapidly with Valentine being brought in to keep this girl's interest in tact. It has a good balance of technical and emotional tales throughout.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just purchase this game and I can put it down.For a free download this is one of the best purchases I made. I recommend this game,very fun to play.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I am a sucker for happy endings. So I was worried that this book was going to let me down. It may have not had the ending I had wished for. But the book would not have been the same with a different ending. It was exactly how it was meant to be. Definitely read this book. It will not disappoint you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldnt stop watching it. I watched all seasons within a weeks time.<br />I cannot wait for the next season to come out
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Tom Cruise did a credible job ...I like these books.  Both my husband and I liked this movie.  It was a good action flick.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot.  The directions are very clear and it plays the way I wanted it to.
B005HEDI3K|4.0|Vivid colors and added extra visual details makes it worth watching.  Even if you can't suspend disbelief and tend to guffaw at to neatly tied up lose ends it still is one of the better adventure episodes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun.! You just can't stop. The little minions are so cute.! :) And whole family enjoys it.!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis is charming and convincing as Abraham Lincoln.  Wonderful movie. Sally Field is a great actresss.  It was one of the best films I've seen in awhile
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I used this to connect a FireWire device to my new iMac that doesn't have a FireWire port. It worked.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This was the best book ever<br /> It might even be better then the hunger games mmmm········ Not quite but still AWESOMELY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this book when I was younger, and I still love it. It's a classic for me, and I've read more times then I can count. Love it!
B000OSC3GM|5.0|Love this film and the book.  This film had good performances with Kirk Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Ava Gardner, Frederic March, Edmond O'brien.  I loved the book when it was first published and couldn't put it down and the movie was good too.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Good app for keeping up with the weather - radar needs some calibration of ground map as it is off by several miles in some cases. Otherwise a good weather tool.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|I love all the big fish games and this looks really good. But it just wont install and I'm dying 2 get this game
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Got a lil bored with it . It's  OK ! May try again later ? For now deleted. But hey it's Free ! So why not at least try it you may like this app !
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|It was interesting knowing about Hitchcock. His wife really held it together and was the hero in this movie.  She was a real pro.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|The drama is contained in this music unlike many films. I highly recommend Hans Zimmer's MAN OF STEEL to anyone!
B0046H95QS|5.0|If you haven't read any of the Hercule Poirot books by Agatha Christie, this is the one I recommend to start with. If you have already read other Poirot books, don't miss this one.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great App fun, entertaining, challenging, make u think about how to get the candy to these cute lil guy I call sweets. Not disappointed in this app at all. U won't either. Got to download this a try ! Great App to play!!!
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Liam Neeson is one of my favs.  This is a nice mystery and is entertaining.  My husband and I like it...probably not loved it but it's an okay movie for a Friday nite at home!
B0094MFITS|5.0|This is not a new movie and it was made for TV, but it really holds your attention.  If you like Tom Selleck, you will enjoy this movie.
B0000DYKET|3.0|I bought these for a Colorado river trip. On the raft, they were comfortable and secure. The materials and stitching are good quality. Water drains out quickly. Your feet do get a bit sweaty, but not too bad. With socks, these can be good walking and hiking footwear. The fast-lace system works well, and the straps are comfy and secure around your ankle.<br /><br />Now here's the problem -- and it may be a FATAL FLAW. When you walk on any kind of sand (dry or wet), the shoe fills with sand immediately. This clogs up in the front toe section and under your foot. On a river, little pebbles also get stuck in the shoe. Likewise, on muddy ground the Keens clog up immediately (within a few steps). I noticed that not a single one of the 8 guides on our 3-boat Colorado River trip had shoes like this. They all wore open-toed sandles or regular full-coverage trail-runner shoes. The gaps let the sand in but the toe prevents the sand/mud/pebbles from escaping. I do like these shoes -- for dry land use and yachting. They are comfortable for mountain biking and great for sailing. But the sand issue is a very big problem that makes these a BAD CHOICE for a beach adventure or a river trip where the banks are sandy or have small pebbles.
B004H3WWU2|3.0|I bought this bag three months ago and have tried very hard to love it.  But unfortunately one aspect of the bag has made it a love/hate proposition...  the shape of the bag does not not allow it to stand on it's own.  While this is not a fatal flaw, it is REALLY annoying.  The only way to put this bag down is to either lean it against something or lay it down flat.  Neither method is very convenient.  I really underestimated how often I 'plop' my bag down.  I use the bag on my daily train commute and struggle to put it on an empty seat next to me without it falling onto another passenger.  Putting it on the floor by feet is even more awkward.  At work, I have to lean it against my desk.<br /><br />With that said, it is still a good bag (just not great).  The quality is top notch and the material feels more like luggage than a backpack.  The storage areas are very good and keep all of my stuff organized.  It is comfortable and not too big.  It is the perfect size for carrying several items plus a laptop or Ipad.
B00AX6KNOY|2.0|This movie is a true B movie...a B horror movie.  Reminds one of the 1950's flicks however not like one I'm going to repeat seeing again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This has proven to be a very popular game with the kids.  They just have to be careful not to buy the extras, which are not necessary for playing and having fun.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Fun read that keeps you in suspense and wondering what will happen and who is who.<br /><br />These types of books require suspending reality.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|5 stars<br />It had very strong emotions<br />I liked how it was written from do many different perspectives<br />I would suggest this book for 5th or 4th graders
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is one of the great classics from the 1930s. And to realize that Olivia de Havilland starred in eight movies with Errol Flynn is amazing. This is a movie that I will play when I am lost some evening wondering what to watch... like &#34;To Catch a Thief.&#34;
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Qt love it! Read Percy Jackson. Rick Riordan is the Awesome author of mythology! 5 stars totally, luv the book!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is phenomenal. It loses a star because it requires Facebook to advance. Even still, you'll lose nights of sleep to this game.
1490313370|4.0|I loved the book a lot and found it inspirational but I tweeted Mr. Altucher and asked for a reply on a idea I had but never got a reply.  By the way he wrote the book, it sounded like he would be more open to some communication, but maybe not.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Five Stars... and all my friends and family know it. Superb movie... a keeper... Like when I buy the DVD, it's a keeper...
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I would have given the game five stars but the recent changes made are reducing the score. I used to play because the game was fun but now is more like work. It is too hard to win game pieces on your own so you have to trade. Trading isn't safe because people scam you. Power ups cost more and are less effective. And daily tournament scores are so low 95% of players will never be able to complete. My advice is to find a group you can trust and trade that way.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|So I will start by saying I was hesitant to read this bc of a few reviews claiming it was too much like Harry potter. I'm glad I overlooked those reviews for the better ones bc I really enjoyed it.<br />Clary is a very likeable character. She's another one of those characters that is dull and doesn't realize she's beautiful but is. But it's not overplayed or pointed out every other paragraph like a lot of books. Thank goodness. It was a pretty easy read. Of course I like Jace. There wasn't a whole lot of build up between the two before they become very close but it flowed decently. I found myself questioning some of the events in the book but ultimately it was pretty fun and a page turner. Especially the huge twist at the end. Whew.... I recommend this book to all who enjoy stories with humans who are supernatural that protect the human race, werewolves, vampires, faeries, demons, and all sorts of other mystical creatures.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Around 2000, when the teen pop backlash was beginning and Backstreet was at the height of their fame, I can remember music critics getting frustrated with the group when Black and Blue came out. Why were they still sticking to that safe pop sound? Why were they of pushing the envelope a bit more like Britney and Christina or NSync before they broke up? Even as a big fan, I questioned this also. Flash forward to thirteen years and a handful of albums later and not much has changed. Critics still shake their heads...Rolling Stone was less than complimentary on this album claiming that since they were out of the spotlight, they could have done anything, yet they stayed in the same, typical pop box. Yet for me, after all of this time, they just earn more respect for this. In an age when pop music continues to compete for shock value, is laden with explicit sex content, and four letter words, these men have maintained class and values. Hats off to them.<br />&#34;In a World Like this&#34;is strong, catchy dance pop at its best...reminiscent of Straight Through My Heart from &#34;This is Us&#34; which was an extremely underrated piece of dance pop. &#34;Breathe&#34; is another standout...the vocals are gorgeous and production is strong. &#34;Madeline&#34; and &#34;Make Believe&#34; are two other tracks that jump out at first listen. &#34;Try&#34; is a pleasant surprise and the R&B flavor is a nice change-up. &#34;Feels Like Home&#34; is my personal favorite...love the mesh of genres...perfect summer song. Also, I love &#34;Soldier&#34; as the closer.<br /><br />In conclusion, do not expect too many of the old school love ballads. This album is more electro-pop inspired with a few acoustic tracks thrown in relying on acoustic guitar. Thanks, guys, for 20 great years. Thanks for staying true to yourselves, each other, us fans, your musical values and personal values...not too easy &#34;In a Word Like This!!&#34;
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The product was poor quality.  The case began to warp and fall apart after 3 months (without even getting wet).  I recommend against.  Unfortunately Amazon warranty will not cover.
0399157565|2.0|I have read many of Ms. Cornwell's books and like the basic characters, but I think this will be the last Scarpetta book I will read. The title of the book is misleading, as most of the information about the paleontology dig is contained in the prologue of slightly more than one page. Some clues are given and discussed regarding the paleontologist's murder, which takes up a few pages. Most of the first 3/4 of the book then diverges to cover another main murder and a peripheral murder (and also a missing persons case trial she is subpoenaed to testify in). I think there was entirely too much detail about the second murder. I think the book could have been much more interesting if there was a bit more information about just what a \\"bone bed\\" is - i.e. give some background about digs so maybe the reader can learn something, and develop the character of the paleontologist a bit so we have some idea who she is and maybe that will make us care about her. The idea of a bone bed seems to be an afterthought here, although the author states in the credits section that going on an actual dig gave her the idea for this book.  And I was disappointed in the ending. I won't give anything away, but I thought it was all wrapped up too quickly at the very end. It seems perhaps the author couldn't figure out how to end the book or who the killer would be, and just came up with something very farfetched.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I grew up in a small rural town.  Most of what I know about city crime and criminal behavior is from movies and books.  The Lincoln Lawyer himself, Matthew McConaughey, is the epitome of city smarts.  He can handle the scumbags, the tough bikers, and on to the rich sophisticates.  He pushes the legal envelop and with the help of his great chauffeur Earl, played perfectly by Laurence Mason he is able to ride the edge in style.  The bad boy Louis Roulet will make you mad as he tries to manipulate Mick Haller, the lawyer.  Though I wouldn't call the movie a thriller, it is a great mystery story and is as much fun as was the book.<br /><br />I read the book a long time ago and enjoyed it as much or more than the movie.  Like all of Michael Connelly's stories this one kept you turning the pages and hating it when you got to the last one.  The movie will keep you glued the same way.
B009RX85N0|5.0|This series also just keeps getting better and better!! I love the way they tell the story of Past and present! Can hardly wait for the<br />new  season to start!
140006922X|5.0|Very well written account of Jesus and his place within the Roman Empire.  It is very detailed and the author does a great job giving opposing views whenever there is a point of debate.  I am really tired of hearing from people who oppose his position when they haven't even read it.  So sad we have such an illiterate society.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|After the first few chapters I couldn't seem to put the book down.  Story of overcoming abuse and finding love.
B002SPQASQ|5.0|If you enjoy a good Western.  I first saw it in black and white.  It's now streaming on Amazon Prime in full color!<br />Brando plays the ultimate happy go lucky rascal and thief.  His scene with the young lady and his  &#60;mother's&#62; ring is great.<br />Then the evil begins when Dad runs out on him and he winds up in prison.<br /><br />The times Dad betrays Brando and shows his truly slimy character are numerous.  Of course in the end, a little good triumphs over a lot of bad.<br />I have it on DVD and watch it on TV or stream it on Prime on my Mac.<br />A great, fun movie.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This has to be the best series ever!! I go into withdrawels whenever the season ends and count the days until it starts up again!!<br />Every season gets better!!!  I dont know if my heart can take any more surprizes!!
1118109791|2.0|I thought it was a good book until I started noticing how many errors there are in this book. The answers to the questions are explained poorly as well. Use it to prepare for the exam but also have another study package as the core.
0679759328|5.0|Interesting story and amazing characters.  Hard tto get into but a great read.  We read it for our Book Club.  Enjoyed the characters and the setting and the surprise ending!
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Im going to make this short cause I agree with everyone on the pros of this device. The only thing that I found flawed with the G13 was that the joystick on this keypad in a really awkward position no matter how I placed my hand. So I have not used it once in the month I have had it. Wish it was a little higher.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I think I will have to watch this movie again on a slow day.  The movie barely gets across the story as told in the book.  The special effects were good.  To get the full effects of the story it would be better if you read the book.
140006922X|1.0|Reza Aslan, author of the new book, Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth, was interviewed on a host of media outlets in the last week. Riding a publicity wave, the book surged to #2 on Amazon's list. Some media reports have introduced Aslan as a \\"religion scholar\\" but have failed to mention that he is a devout Muslim.<br />  His book is not a historian's report on Jesus. It is an educated Muslim's opinion about Jesus, yet the book is being peddled as objective history on national TV and radio. \\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years.<br />  Aslan is not a trained historian. Like tens of thousands of us he has been formally educated in theology and New Testament Greek. He is a bright man with every right to hold his own opinion about Jesus, and to proselytize his opinion.<br />  As a sincere man, Aslan's Muslim beliefs affect his entire life, including his conclusions about Jesus. But this is not being widely disclosed. \\"Zealot\\" is being presented as objective and scholarly history, not as it actually is-an educated Muslim's opinions about Jesus and the ancient Near East.<br />  \\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years. Its conclusions are long-held Islamic claims, namely, that Jesus was a zealous prophet type who didn't claim to be God, that Christians have misunderstood him, and that the Christian Gospels are not the actual words or life of Jesus but \\"myth.\\"<br />  These claims are not new or unique. They are hundreds of years old among Muslims. Sadly, readers who have listened to interviews on NPR, \\"The Daily Show,\\" Huffington Post or MSNBC may pick up the book expecting an unbiased and historic report on Jesus and first century Jewish culture (I will let my Jewish friends address Aslan's statement on MSNBC that, \\"there were certainly a lot of Jewish terrorists in first century Palestine\\").<br />  As a journalist and author who is Christian I cannot imagine penning a so-called objective biography of Muhammad and then concealing my conflict of interest in national media interviews.<br />  In world history there are no religions more violently and anciently opposed than the crusading, fighting, at times blood-shedding rivals of historic Islam and historic Christianity. Even non-violent Muslims and Christians, like Aslan and myself, understand that we hold aggressively oppositional views, particularly about Jesus. National news coverage of \\"Zealot\\" has ignored this conflict of interest.<br />  \\"Zealot\\" is written with the self-assumed authority of groundbreaking revelation from a historian. In reality, it is a religious person's opinion about Jesus-from an adherent to the religion that has been in violent opposition to Christ for 1,400 years.<br />  Aslan informs us that we cannot trust the Gospel of Mark because it was written 40 years after Jesus' death. He then chides us to trust his new book, written almost 2,000 years later.<br />  I believe in Aslan's right to hold and propagate any opinion. It's a right that, ironically, Christians do not have in many Muslim countries.<br />  My concern is that national media coverage be smart and forthright about this conflict of interest, just as it would be if I, a Christian author and pastor, wrote a book about Muhammad.<br />  Pouring praise onto \\"Zealot\\" as new information about Jesus, without explaining its author's devotion to a combatting religion, is blatant bias. This same bias would be unthinkable if the Christian and Muslim roles were reversed.<br />  With its riveting demolition of Jesus, \\"Zealot\\" will continue to attract interviews, some from reporters who want to see Jesus deconstructed. Many more interviews will come from reporters who simply don't understand that Reza Aslan has a horse in this race. He is not an objective observer, but, to use his own word, a zealot, with religious motivation to destroy what Westernculture has believed about its central figure for hundreds of years. In many ways, this conflict is larger than Christianity and Islam. It is a conflict of Western and Middle Eastern foundations. These are great and important debates that we should welcome, but let's be honest about our motivations, positions and conflicts of interest as we dialogue.<br />  Let's hope reporters in future interviews will, being informed, mention the glaring conflict of interest in this Islamic opinion of Jesus. It is no more objective than my educated views about Muhammad, as a Christian.<br />  \\"Zealot\\" is not new work from a historian. It is a sophisticated presentation of views that Muslims have held about Jesus for more than 1,000 years.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Never learned so many things about flowers and people.  I kept the book because I wanted to  have access to the meaning of the flowers! Would recommend it highly
B0015T6G2G|5.0|An amazing and compelling story about an amazing man.  I read it on a trip to South Africa where I saw all the places Mandela refers to.
B00B10ENBA|5.0|A wonderful movie that exceeded the hype that I had heard before I bought it.  I have now seen it twice, watching again for tidbits I might have missed, and enjoyed it even more.  If you lived through the Iran hostage crisis you will certainly enjoy the perspective and excitement of this story.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|A wonderful rendering of four of the most iconic films of the last 40 years.  This Blu-Ray collection takes our adventurer to a new level of appreciation, beginning with a wonderful backstory on the 5th disc.  Sometimes it is almost as fascinating as the film it is describing!  I sure hope there is no arguing about this version and that version and so on, because all seems to be nicely intact and theatrically correct -- if that's a big point.  I myself just revel in seeing things again for the first time!  I can take the dark with the light, the comedy with the drama, and most of all the homage to the great films of a bygone era...  If you have been out of this country for the past almost half a century, then you might not be familiar with these films; in which case I suggest this very nice set of up-to-date technological discs to get you in the mood for fun and adventure.  It's what we got to the movies for!  And if you are lucky enough to have a 4-foot or wider flat screen TV at home, all you need is some popcorn and someone to share the fun with!
B00D7JGL36|4.0|This is a great record that I'm sure I will like even more as I hear more of it. I would have given it five stars, except that Vince, in fact, does try too hard to sound like Merle and, particularly, Buck. He also pronounces some words exactly like Buck did rather than how Vince does. While I love this album, it would have been even better if Vince had sounded like Vince.
B000SZK41M|5.0|One of the best action film of the last 25 years. One of Bruce Willis best films I have seen.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I watched Voyager many years ago but never saw the final season.<br />It's excellent - their storytelling just got better every season and the season finale is a great wrap-up with some interesting twists!
B001TH16DI|4.0|I rate this a 4 because I seriously was expecting a remastered blu-ray like the ones Walmart sells at the same price.
B00AK77WPE|5.0|Great production and quality. But I have to ask again: Where is the Bluray Disc?!. Am I the only one latino that buys blueray discs?. JLG one of the little group of great arrangers and songwriters of the Salsa genre, and a DVD is the best thing we can buy?. It is just sad.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Really, this thing is super cool.  Unfortunately, it has yet to arrive!  But its the absolute best!  Go product of mystery!
B005EHQGTS|3.0|Funny I had last version and worked perfect but this version crashes randomly. Tried everything and still crashes about 2 to 5 min after connectin to pc. O well at least it was free so I cant really complain
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|I rate this a 4 because for some reason I was expecting a remastered blu-ray like Wal-mart. otherwise i have what i ordered
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loved it and burned through the entire series in a day and a half!  Glad that we purchased it and can't wait for Season 3 to start.
B00BK3MSME|1.0|Another disappointing cd from Madeleine.  I am still a fan but this, just like Standing on a Rooftop, just makes me miss the older cds even more.<br /><br />Gene
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is fun and very addicting!!! But it could use more towers that's my only downside. But otherwise it's FUN
B0027MJU00|3.0|Enjoyed the author's previous books, Gone Girl and Sharp Objects, quite a bit  more than this one. They seemed to have the ability to keep my interest peaked more than this one. It wasn't terrible....just didn't have the same intensity that the others did.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have always been a 'standard' mouse user. I've had corded and wireless, track ball and laser. I've never had a 'gaming' mouse though and I'm blown away at how much better this is than anything I've used before. I love the button on top that allows you to adjust the mouse speed on the fly. The scroll wheel is smooth and accurate. The mouse comes with weights you can add to the internals so that it feels right for you. The light at the anchor can be changed to just about any color also.<br /><br />The only Con I would come up with is getting used to the extra buttons on the thumb. I hit them accidentally even after a few months of use.<br /><br />I would buy this again and I would highly recommend it.
B008LV8TSU|3.0|Enjoyable enough but I am just not a fantasy lover--no matter how I try.  I realize this is not a very helpful review.  If you enjoy the fantasy genre, then go for it. I can see where it would be a really fun read.
B005HEQ864|5.0|This show was top notch; still better than almost anything on TV these days.  I guess this is when science was a cool thing, rather than silenced and &#34;evil&#34;, and it was a nerd's dream.  Nothing was dumbed-down for the audience.  The plot lines were great, and the characters were very well rounded-out; Data's character–a unique android who became more human as the series evolved (and he learned more about how humans think)–was a philosophical story unto itself.  Wharf, a half-Klingon, added yet another avenue for unique perspectives and plot lines into the Star Trek universe.  And the actors as a whole, starting with Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard, were stellar, many having been classically trained.  No expense was spared on sets and special effects, which still hold up today against high-budget hollywood films.  The late 80s/early 90s was a great time for TV audiences; I guess the network execs saw worth in spending money on producing quality series such as this one.<br /><br />Now, even the &#34;educational&#34; channels (History Channel, Discovery, etc) are mostly reality TV programs which cost nothing to produce.  I'm very thankful Star Trek:TNG is not only available for streaming, but was fully restored in HD (all the special effects were redone by hand to hold up to the Blu-Ray HD conversion–noted as one of the most comprehensive film restoration projects ever attempted).
B000059T00|3.0|Packing was less than expected. But the cd is original release, only the case was damaged upon receipt. You can get replacement cases in ten packs pretty cheap.  Cannot beat these prices either.  Good deals, I recommend them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As with the previous seasons, this one is gripping, interesting, and despite being somewhat predictable in the last episode, utterly wonderful.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Grate show do not know why I did not see this sooner. I love this show. good for any one.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Just in cases, you might want to know, there are lovely actors spanning all walks of life who are intimately intertwined in each others lives. Comedy, Romantic, Drama, wonderful music and story line. Enjoy (the tiny insignificant details).
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love suits...the music &#34;greenback boogie&#34;  is the perfect expression of what motivates these guys..great show, great acting..Louis is soo funny!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book goes so much more in depth into the actual historical era that Jesus lived in. Whether you're a Christian or not, it's an illuminating look at historical fact.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Another great point and click adventure. These guys have pulled out all the stops in creating this one. It was well worth waiting for.  I am already dreading the end because there are only a handful of games that are as fun and detailed.  UPDATE:  I finished the game with only 1 hint.  I won't say where or what, but I just never thought to shake my device!  Well Done.
6305132984|5.0|..when there is West Side Story. Wonderful story, following a 'modern day' romeo and juliet story. Make it a musical and there you have perfection. Bernstein was a genius.
1591845556|3.0|I expected there to be more to this book. Granted, the author is very upfront and open about the book from the beginning. However, you have to be reading the book to know he's giving you nothing really new, and it's all in the first 30 pages of the book. I would have rather paid $5 for the first 3 chapters as an ebook.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent.  Everything by Hosseini is outstanding.  The language is beautiful and the story unfolds in a delightful manner.  I look forward to his next novel.
B00AIBZJS4|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE Cirque fan, but for some reason this production just fell flat with me.  I've seen TV specials with Cirque performers and was mesmerized by the way it was produced (and have seen the live shows several times), but this particular movie just didn't move me at all.  I might even give it away..............
B0082XJGRK|5.0|I listen to/ read this every few weeks. Powerful reminders on how to be a human being, meditating on these ideas often has made me a harder, more ambitious, worker. You'd be doing yourself a great favor to give this a read.
B005544V6A|5.0|Loved every second of this show. Watched the first two seasons in a matter of days. Can't wait for season 3!

B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is good/ok it's nice game and get this game. It's nice. I like the sound effects on the coaster once you move it and it has nice. But 1 thing I wish you can build the coasters cuz that would be awsome.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|The movie is funny, action-packed, and exactly what you expect for Bruce Willis shoot them up.<br />My rental was exactly what I was looking for, and so I give this movie five stars.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so awesome it has great graphics and it is a lot better than that lame game made by pocket gems called tap pet hotel keep up the good games  gameloft
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was at Goodwill and I picked this book up without looking at it so I could see the book that was next to it. Then I looked at what I was holding and squealed. I was so shocked to find this book. I've been dying to read this book for over a year. Now that I have...<br /><br /> Let me catch my breathe... I haven't been able to breathe the entire time I was reading this book. I was holding my breathe, on the edge of my bed, shocked, confused, sad, happy, soooo many emotions.<br /><br />I cried. Not just tearing up. I actually was crying. I don't envy Travis and Abby's relationship at all. It's violent, unhealthy, dependent and way too intense for my blood. But the story was amazing and I found myself in love with all of the characters. It also shows that, although Travis didn't change ALL of his lifestyle, love can change people for the better.<br /><br />America was an amazing best friend. Shep was a good boyfriend. AND what story would be complete without the gay guy best friend? Finch was awesome and such a good friend to Abby.<br /><br />Parker... Hmmm. I'm not entirely sure what to say about him. I think he really was just trying to get in Abby's pants so maybe he could say that he \\"bagged\\"  her when Travis couldn't. I'm not sure of his exact motives but I don't think they were good.<br /><br /> I honestly can't say anything bad about this book. It kept me guessing and I was happy with the ending.<br /><br />I was, however, unhappy that this was the first book that I have ever owned that I got wet... Why this book? Seriously? Why not get Twilight wet? UGH!<br /><br />Overall, I gave the book 5/5 stars.
B0053O89KG|5.0|There is definitely good chemistry between Castle and his muse, Kate Beckett.  And he is great with his daughter - the pride he shows in her accomplishments makes one wonder if there isn't already a relationship in place with them.  And I have to admit to being dazzled when the Mystery Writers Poker Club meets - Mike Connelly, James Patterson...a mystery reader's dream.  Total entertainment!
B000059T00|5.0|If you haven't experienced this album and consider yourself a music aficionado, you aren't!!!! This is Winwood and Clapton as virgins.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I purchased this case for a Canon Rebel T3i.  The camera with the kit 18-55 lens fits easily in the case.  While other reviews noted little storage space, this case can accommodate an extra battery, SD cards, lens brush and lens cloth with room to spare.  It's perfect for carrying the essentials for a day of shooting.  The case is well made and the strap is quite comfortable.
0446547638|5.0|My daughter read this book and she thouroughly enjoyed it! I would recommend this book to all!  Nicholas Sparks has many more books to read, so check them out!
B004UID2LC|2.0|Sometimes the song only downloads a few seconds of it. Also, the first several downloads were clear and hq but the next and recent downloads are very fuzzy. Uninstalling also because of malware reviews.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|In this book all happened within two weeks but she added some new characters with more room for story lines.  Now I understand why it ended went nowhere so she can add two more books.  I really want to see a happy ending with all they have gone through.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|A classic that I grew up with now my son can enjoy on the go! It is one of his favs.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The author of THE KITE RUNNER and A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS delivers a third novel based on Pakistani culture during a time when he accents desperate poverty as the backdrop and rationale for a father's dreadful choice. He prepares his two young children with a mythic parable about a mountain monster. The story following his choice portrays how the main characters handle the change. Both lament and understanding live side by side in the echoing consequences of that fateful decision. Instead of telling of Taliban violence or abuse of women qua women, Hosseini writes of family dynamics and family history until some resolution emerges.<br />This is a Mid-Eastern variation of SOPHIA'S CHOICE except that more life than death comes out of it.<br />Struggling characters, engaging style, always hints of more to come under the surface -- or is it up on the next mountain that each character must climb?
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  The whole family can watch it.  It has a great Christian theme and is a good reminder of what is really important in life.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|For the young gal that &#34;America's Got Talent&#34; overlooked, she's done a whopping job putting this album together.  Love the music, style and tempo of her work.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Good story line and you fall in love with the characters!  I want Carson to be my butler at my house!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It seems like the app struggles to upload all the weather content in a timely manner because of all the way-too-busy advertisements that are loaded first. I like how the new version updates the map more frequently however I don't like how zoomed in the initial map view is then I have to tap it again to load the interactive map then tap again to reload a wider zoom. All while waiting for ads.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a story about many things. Lincoln for sure. But also about several other key people of the time. It's almost a mini-biography of Lincoln's peers.  It's also a story about the times. The social forces, the vast geography, the hard weather.<br />Mostly, it's about courage, creativity, and connection. Doris Kearns Goodwin shows us how Abraham Lincoln found his center and had the courage to advocate for it at all times. It also showed how his brilliant mind was able to find ways to position powerful issues like slavery in the most understandable and human terms. It is also a story about how Lincoln was able to connect with people in ways that made others want to be around him, follow him, vote for him, and go out on a limb for him.<br /><br />I didn't like history in school. I love it now with this kind of fascinating writing.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I was looking for an inexpensive watch I could wear to work. They get banged up as I work in construction.  When it arrived I was surprised at the quality.  This watch is too nice to wear to work! Looks great, has a spot in the back where you can see the movement, keeps good time.  What more can you ask for.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Received this from Amazon today and setup was very easy. Took about five minutes. Compared to Roku the picture quality is terrible. A lot of buffering. When I click the icon on my PC it takes me directly to a porn site that blinks on and off. Cannot go to anything else. Eh, no thank you!
B00992CF6W|3.0|It rocks but it makes no sense that this version on kindle is behind minecraft pe for iPhone. But in other words it ROCKS!!!!

1593975635|2.0|It is fortunate that Dan Brown met with enough success in his early novels to have his mega-successful The Da Vinci Code published and made into a major motion picture.  Had his early works, of which this novel is included, been the measure of his talent, he would have justifiably been delivered to the ranks of \\"I-had-too-much-time-so-I-wrote-a-novel-and-miraculously-got-it-published.\\"  To highlight all that is wrong with this novel would take a dissertation-length review, to mention what is good about it will take decidedly less time.<br /> Dan Brown does have a flair for writing fiction that begins in a dead run and does not slow until the final pages.  Typically, all the action takes place in less than 24 hours (in this case, the crisis is over in 8 hours), there are henchmen trying to keep secrets or steal secrets or keep others from doing either, a hero that overcomes huge odds to achieve the near impossible, the vulnerable love interest that is powerless to help until the last possible moment in spite of being the smartest person in the room.  All these elements are present in this dreadful \\"chase them around the world\\" novel.  The \\"secret\\" is an unbreakable code (Digital Fortress) that has the NSA's ultra-secret code breaking processor, named Translator, running beyond capacity.  The henchman is a deaf assassin sent to retrieve the \\"pass key\\" of the code in order for the code to be sold on the black market.  The hero is a college professor who has been sent by the Asst. Director of the NSA's Cryptology Division to find it before \\"anyone else gets their hands on it\\" even though he has no experience in espionage. The vulnerable genius is the head cryptographer of the division. How all the parts arrive at a semblance of resolution may be the single indicator of Mr. Brown's talent in this book.<br /> There were moments, while I was listening to this book, when I groaned at the stupidity of the plot.  When the author has to have a character act in ways that make no sense and those actions are not in line with the behavior presented previously in the work solely in an attempt to create tension, said author needs to return to his \\"Creative Writing 101\\" class notes.  Repeatedly, there are errors, missteps, inconsistencies and dangling plot lines.  The ending may be the apex of inanity.  The \\"world\\" two of the main characters have helped build is in flames, the department who is to manage \\"the largest secrets of the U.S. Government\\" is in shambles and they have both witnessed unbearable violence in the last 24 hours yet they are having a jolly weekend in a remote cabin, having slept soundly the night through.  Give me a break!<br /> The body count in the book is large.  The language is atrocious.  There is only implied sex, but I would consider any writing meant to generate a prescribed emotional response without the benefit of believable plot, characters of depth or plausible resolution to be smut.  I may read another of Dan Brown's books, as The Da Vinci Code and The Lost Symbol were good books for the genre, but it will take me awhile for my eyes to heal from the train wreck that is Digital Fortress.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Never disappointed with Chalaine Harris! You just can't go wrong with her. Sorry to see the southern vampire novels come to an end
B008JFUQZ2|1.0|Didn't care for this FX festival of big monsters wrecking havoc on unknown cities. The story had holes bigger than the Grand Canyon and characters thinner than the paper they were printed on. If you like \\"2001\\", \\"Blade Runner\\" \\"On the Beach\\" or Rod Serling's \\"Twilight Zone\\" this probably isn't the film for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy \\"Jackass\\" and \\"Transformers\\" you will probably really enjoy this movie since it doesn't bother with story and keeps the FX destruction and explosions coming every few minutes so as not to burden the audience with having to think.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Absolutely loved this album. And the second cd from the delux was amazing too. I play it all the time in my car.
B008FWHGYS|3.0|I watched the movie about a week ago, and I cant tell you who the characters were or what the story was about. I dont remember a thing about it
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|I think the picture and sound quality of this Blu-ray are of the best I've seen.  I saw this movie in the theater and loved it.  Watching it again, at home, late at night, all alone in my house was perfect.  With my Samsung LED TV and awesome surround sound system, it was like being there.  The flies were buzzing right past my ears. Jane Levy was terrific in the role as Mia. She looked terrifying sitting on the bunk beds talking to her brother. And Elizabeth Blackmore was scary as hell as she went after them with a nail gun. It's a great horror movie and a beautiful Blu-ray. Surely not for everyone, but definitely a case of the remake being better than the original...and I love the original.
140006922X|1.0|This book is authored by a Muslim that converted to Christianity and back to Islam. Keep that in the back of your mind if you choose to read this. Taqiyya and Kitman. Look the words up if you don't already know them. Quran (2:191-193) - \\"And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out.\\" Quran (8:12) - \\"I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them\\"<br /><br />Those are quotes from the book he follows as his life practice, as he writes about Christ.

0141345659|4.0|The Fault in Our Stars is the fifth novel by American author, John Green. Hazel Grace Lancaster is a quirky sixteen-year-old with terminal lung cancer. In a Support Group she deems of doubtful value, she meets one-legged seventeen-year-old Augustus Waters, survivor of osteosarcoma. Gus and Hazel click almost immediately, sharing music and books, movies and jokes. Hazel's need for closure about the characters of her favourite book leads them both down an unexpected path. The characters are appealing and most of the banter is funny, if occasionally having the saccharine sweetness of My Sister's Keeper (the terrible movie, not the brilliant book), but ultimately, there is plenty of humour (some of it quite black), lots of wisdom and moments that will have tears welling in the eye of the most cynical reader. The plot has a twist that will hit hard. The best quote is by Peter van Houten (and as a cloggie I have a perfect right to laugh out loud at this one!): \\"Dutch is not so much a language as an ailment of the throat.\\" This book is a look into the truly unique world of the cancer patient, dipping into the cancer patient's lexicon, touching on subjects as diverse as cancer perks, relationships with terminal patients and fear of being a grenade: a ticking time bomb that wounds everyone close to you when it explodes. Whether this is a realistic portrayal can only be judged by someone with a terminal diagnosis, but Green certainly presents an interesting perspective. Funny and moving.

B00CZAYNOC|5.0|This is a masterpiece just like American Capitalist, which is my favourite FFDP's album.<br />The melodies are great and the lyrics too. Can't wait for the volume 2 to come out.<br />FFDP never let us down!
0307946711|5.0|One Day is the third novel by British author, screenwriter, and actor, David Nicholls. The day referred to in the title is St. Swithin's Day, July 15th, and the narration describes what is happening in the lives of two people, Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley, each year on that day as well as referring to significant events of the preceding year. Emma and Dexter are first encountered on the day after their graduation and are followed through twenty years of life: relationships, career highs and lows, personal crises, addictions, weddings, marriages, divorces, extramarital affairs, parenthood, resounding successes and abysmal failures, loss of significant family members, loneliness, cohabitation and physical ageing all feature. Apart from straight narration, Nicholls uses letters (sent and unsent), poems, phone messages and newspaper articles to tell the story, and he cleverly creates the feel of the period with songs, books, movies, TV shows, world affairs, politics and sports. It all feels very real. Dexter and Emma have lots of depth and appeal; the supporting characters are likewise interesting. Nicholls manages to evoke plenty of laughter, but also tears (occasionally at the same time!) as well as groans and sighs. He also packs a punch that will leave the reader gasping. This is a marvellous novel that will have readers searching out other works by David Nicholls.
B006GLVGDC|4.0|I enjoyed it, of course, but it just wasn't as good as the original, which I loved. I'm still glad I bought it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved access to the movie; ran smooth, able to pause and also appreciate the closed caption so you don't have to up the volume for the low conversations!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I just finished the series for a second time and I am so in love with all of Suzanne's books! The Hunger Games gives a sense of sisterly love and protection, which is then extremely heartfelt in the arena with Katniss and Peeta. I cant wait to see the movies and decide which I like best!!!!!!!
B005NQ94KS|5.0|One Day is the movie based on the novel of the same title by British author, David Nicholls. The day referred to in the title is St. Swithin's Day, July 15th, and the movie shows what is happening in the lives of two people, Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley, each year on that day as well as referring to significant events of the preceding year. Emma and Dexter are first encountered on the day after their graduation and are followed through twenty years of life: relationships, career highs and lows, personal crises, addictions, weddings, marriages, divorces, extramarital affairs, parenthood, resounding successes and abysmal failures, loss of significant family members, loneliness, cohabitation and physical ageing all feature. Emma is well portrayed by Anne Hathaway; Jim Sturgess is excellent as Dexter; Rafe Spall, Patricia Clarkson and Ken Stott deserve special mentions as Ian,  Dexter's mother Alison Mayhew and Dexter's father Steven. Young Eden and Kayla Mendelgrein play Jasmine Mayhew very well. The scenery and atmosphere come across well, and the screenplay is remarkably (and refreshingly) faithful to the book, perhaps because it was also written by David Nicholls. The locations are often sumptuous (Edinburgh, Paris, London) and the extras (deleted scenes, interviews, commentary) are also well worth watching. A very watchable movie of a marvellous novel.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|great item action pack great acting in my opinion one of denzel best preformances joh goodman don cheto excelent roles
B0083EM24C|5.0|I'll admit I didn't like Passion Pit for the longest time, and they are now in my top 5. Their music has just vastly improved over time. They have a lot of fun catchy songs on this cd but also some more serious songs - mostly dealing with his bipolar disorder.<br /><br />While Manners is a great CD, this one is just better.<br /><br />Live, they play a lot of the songs off of Gossamer now. I can't stop listening.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The hunger games series was phenomenal in that it had a genre for every reader. Horror, romance, adventure, sci-fi, fantasy etc. Mockingjay was harder to follow then the rest but when pushed through and read more than once, multiple things aren't questioned anymore and you can get the full concept of the series.
B00425S1H8|5.0|No issues to report, works great with 64 bit drivers, tested with both Windows 8 and Windows 7, no driver install needed.
1451695195|5.0|I believe in an afterlife, and there are more and more people (adults and children) providing their idea of that time after we &#34;die&#34;, but this is one of the best.  All hate to come back and are no longer afraid to die.  These kinds of books give me hope, and peace.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the next Jack Reacher. Awesome...I really love the whole Jack Reacher series!
B003O86FMW|4.0|So far this series has been incredibly written. I feel that many characters are extremely relative to real life situations. Personally I relate to Katniss. I thought the movie of the first book was excellent and took me on an emotion roller coaster so to speak. And I cant wait for Catching Fire to come out in the theater!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004C3DLJ8|2.0|My son LOVES Toy Story 1 and 2, so I was looking forward to renting this movie, but I was sadly let down. I love most of Disney Pixar movies so I am sad to say this one disappointed me. I think the storyline was too &#34;grown up&#34; and not near as intriguing as the first 2 movies. Will not be renting this one again nor buying it for our home library.
B008NMT684|5.0|Trenton enjoyed the applause for correct completion of a puzzle.  Teaching concepts of front, middle, top,bottom and so on.  We didnt know about popping balloons.  Now we have to let some &quot;get away&quot; and pretend to see them floating out our window.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is so awesome! It is really easy to reach goals but half of them give you a do able challenge!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Loved the movie as a kid, and still love it now. The DVD version is the same one you remember, the blu ray has an added scene or two. Definitely worth it.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|You have to love when old guys like these get together just to have Fun.  The only problem is I can't do 1/4 of what they do!!
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Really fun date night movie. Left me wishing for MORE MINIONS!!! (On the screen and in my real life...) Two thumbs up!
B001XULSG6|5.0|I've seen every star trek movie and so has almost everyone else....but I enjoyed the HD version of this movie. Can't tell if it's&#34; Blue Ray&#34; quality but it looks very good . There was a little what I call streaming artifact...you know when the quality fades a little but correct's itself very quickley it  happen only once. Well worth a look.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love having the app on my kindle and phone and love the reminders on watched or outbid items. very helpful
B009FZHYKU|3.0|It's ok in a pinch for entertainment.  Acting is mediocre.  Horror is good.  Plot is ok.<br />Sometimes you get tired of the zombie bashing.
B007N31ZKQ|5.0|A must own movie!  This movie is a classic movie that uses a lot of dark humor, but is an awesome flick.  The dude abides.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|I like Great Falls, in fact i llived near there for about 3 years.  The dismal folks in this story<br />do not attracft - from my point of view.
B0054NQZ9S|5.0|I enjoyed it, good acting, good story.  I would recommend it anyone. Tommy Lee Jones is very good in this movie.
1439153663|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Hope Kathleen Grissom writes another book. I learned something I didn't know about indentured servitude.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It was ok. Basically just the same story made in the style of the lord of the rings. It's watchable but didn't hold my interest.
0470913029|5.0|This book is excellent to use as a guideline if anyone wants to truly change their eating habits.  It is not easy to follow but once you get on the right track you will feel different.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Both the story and the writing were exceptional in this novel. The voice of the central character was believable and evenly strong throughout. I will recommend this to my book club.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie grabs your attention from the beginning and holds it until the very end.  Can't wait to see the rest of the series.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I can fall asleep to white noise and wake up to a variety of different noises. It's great, especially because the Alarm Clock is free; great purchase from my point of view.
B000004286|4.0|I really liked the movie. So I knew the soundtract would be great also. If you enjoy Scottish music, I would recommend this album.
0525425772|5.0|my grandchildren enjoyed reading it. There were no ugly words. My ten year old grandson will start reading the first Theodore book and grow all the books.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|Ok movie, great to see something different from a zombie movie. I would not mind having this a part of the zombie/horror collection.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This is SUCH a great book. It has mystery, a bit of romance, and just that hard core teenage umph to it that makes it great. The book is told so truthfully and it's so easy to relate to! LOVE IT.
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|My son told me the cd was not as good as the last one. I made the purhase anyway, everyone has his/her own opinion.<br />I love the cd. It is J. Cole but a little different from the first. It is a cd I can put in and let it run. Of course there are tracks that I favor more than others but nothing that I really dislike. I think this is a solid purchase.
B006R4H5FG|5.0|This book really changed my perspective on presenting and I have been presenting for 25 years and gave 588 presentations last year in 9 countries
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Like the concept of the game. I wish it would have some rules or direction. I'm glad it was free to experiment the ideal of the game.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I love everything about this book; it's the perfect read for any teenager. I recommend reading this and any other John Green book as well... He really is a great author! I haven't read a book this good in a long time.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The novel is very well written.  It definitely gives a good idea of life in afghanistan, a diificult life. The story is bleak, and disturbing tale of the repercussions of a father who gives his child to someone else to raise because of his destitute situation.<br />  The reader follows the effects of this decision on the family members as well as on the next generation. It is riveting.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a great game.  I love games that make you think and use your logic skills.  Cant wait to start playing all the new updates that hopefully will be coming soon.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Great action movie keeps you on the edge of your seat! The lessons taught in this movie remind me very slightly of Marvel's earlier Spiderman flicks teaching good values not just senseless violence for entertainment purposes. With that said I gave it  four stars instead of five because of the small amount of language and violence that is in it though handled appropriately the violence is heavy at times. Overall a good fun movie that I enjoyed very much!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is pretty cool I like slender and I love my kindle fire HD this works great on it if you like the snowboarding legend this is the games for you it's awesome
B008CX2A2I|5.0|After I bought an Onkyo receiver said &#34;Bluetooth ready&#34;, I had to buy this little USB key for Onkyo. The setup is as simple as plugging it to the front USB port, pressing the button on USB key for pairing with a phone or tablet. And voila! It works.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|As a long-time ST fan, the original series in particular, I thought this movie was horrible. Rebooting for a new generation is not helpful when one avoids social commentary. Yes, there were 2 or 3 sentences alluding to the drone issue of our own time, but the rest of the movie was nothing more than an action thriller with bits plagiarized from the Wrath of Khan. Simply alluding to events from the old ST might stimulate a few smiles, but the social commentary that was left out in this case was the very foundation of Roddenberry's approach. That's why the social commentary was the very basis of the plots on many of the original episodes (as well as Next Generation episodes) and some of the movies. Many of them bothered certain politicians, corporations, and leaders of organized religion. ST IV is an example of this, and after it came out more people were aware that Humpback whales were in danger and this had a positive effect on treaties regarding that issue. Try removing the social commentary in many of those stories and you have no movie at all. Brushing that aside and using characters and events from the old movie as an excuse to display new special effects is not bringing Roddenberry's \\"philosophy\\" to younger viewers.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|In Islam to believe God has a Son is a major sin, thus Jesus Christ, though looked upon as divine in Islam, cannot be the Son of God which Christians of course believe.<br /><br />This book written by a Muslim is consistent with the fact that Islam does not believe God/Allah can have a son and thus is truly biased
0374533555|5.0|Since a lot of reviews here are long, I'll keep mine short:<br /><br />You get an entire Malcolm Gladwell book's worth of useful content about every three pages.  Buy this book.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this game is pretty cool, I enjoy the defence part and how you can not die either. Especially when you're ronan. :)
140006922X|2.0|Just keep in mind that the author has said, \\"I realize millions of Christians believe Jesus was God incarnate, but they also believe he was a man.\\" And so, the author proposes who Jesus was based on if he were ONLY a man at that time in history. If Jesus WERE God as well as a man, then the same conclusions the author makes cannot be drawn. As God, he would have conducted himself differently than what just a plain man would have done. Therefore, there doesn't seem to be any reason for the writing of this book. If Jesus were just a man and not God, then his life would bear little of interest. The reason millions of people are so interested in Jesus is because of, either his true divinity, or wanting to deny his divinity. I'm not saying the author is in the latter group, but if he isn't, then he wrote a very boring, irrelevant book.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I wanted the real candy crush game and kindle wont let you download it. I just don't understand why that is.

B001P1MZNI|5.0|Count Basie, Quincy Jones (yes, that Quincy), & Frank in his prime.  I've listened to this on vinyl, cassette, CD, & iTunes since its release.

B00C1BUYX4|1.0|I think it's a piece of crap with a completely erroneous message.  Rent it for orientation of minds full of mush, and indoctrination of the new American wallowing, groveling, submissive pieces of SSSSSS.

B0066W1AZK|1.0|This was my first chess game for the Kindle Fire and it does play a good game.  But then I noticed that the Queen is starting on the wrong square.  Has anyone noticed this?  The Queen must be on the square of her own color. Am I missing something here?  I hope someone comments on this.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I haven't seen the show at all. The writing is superb and constantly keeps you in its grip. The author goes to great lengths to connect you and make you like each character. The only downside is that some of those characters don't get the happy ending other stories would give them. Thats what makes it excellent.
B008PNBU30|5.0|I love this band and the new album is as good as the last. Their music has gotten me through some tough times and appreciate what they stand for. They also rock live!!!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|The title I gave to this little review is by no means something I take lightly: don't get me wrong, I loved Man of Steel to bits, but it is safe to say that it wouldn't have been as great with different music. Mr. Zimmer has crafted one of the greatest soundtracks of the last ten years, and it's worth every penny to own it in this special format. Very beautiful packaging and a cool booklet are a couple of things you'll find here: don't miss it!

B002MCJZHS|4.0|The album was an excellent continuous smooth melody that flowed from track to track almost seamlessly. The over all tone is great for anyway who wants to be accompanied by low breathy modern alternative while they relax or go about their quaint daily tasks.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|It has been a while since I caught Macgyver so this was like old home week.  Some of these shows I'm sure I missed, but it does bring back memories!
140006922X|4.0|If you really want to know if this book is good or not, Just read the reviews from those who have \\" Amazon Verified Purchase\\" stamps. Apparently those who hate  history of Jesus written by NON-CHRISTIAN author  start flooding it  with fake reviews.
B00C5ZORES|3.0|This album is more punk alt rock than anything. The title is a bit misleading and for that reason alone I gave it three stars. When someone says rock and roll the mind inexplicably gravitates toward the thought of The Beatles while my guitar gently weeps, to AC/DC Back in Black or Robert Plant bellowing out at the end of Whole Lotta Love, hell even 30 Seconds to Mars with Jared Leto letting out his rock star beast of a voice. But this attempt at saving rock and roll seems more like a rehashing of old fall out boy lyrics and chords, an over abundance use of a background teen choir and/or mob that sang in unison not in key, and a tempo so repetitive in nature that most songs sound like they could have come from either of the previous two albums. And the title song on the album was the least rock and roll thing about it. Sir Elton John is still an idle, his voice amazing, the timing with Patrick Stump impeccable but that song is not Rock and Roll. Its nowhere close that song is more in the genre of James Blunt, Piano Man by Billy Joel, or xylo myloto by Coldplay but it is anything but rock and roll. Don't get me wrong those are all great artists but they don't epitomize rock and roll and neither does this album.

B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game was way too short. I tore through it on my lunch break.  But, I got it for free and at that price I can't complain.  Even at $1 it's a good deal. I paid more for the soda I drank during aforementioned lunch break and this app was more refreshing.
0399245030|5.0|I have two other books by Oliver Jeffers - &#34;How To Catch A Star&#34; and &#34;The Way Back Home&#34; and this is just as good as the others. His style is simple, but the story is always nice and sweet. I love that the books are about a boy since so many center on girl characters. My son loves this book, as well as the others, since he is also able to read it himself. Great book for early readers.

B004U8VWLE|5.0|This is an amazing film and Natalie Portman delivers both a believable and an amazing performance. This is a film about spiritual ability that transcends the natural realm...that which takes one from being really great at something and makes them absolutely fascinating....watch it...you will love it!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Its ok good book for people who like a lil romance and action really good book its worth the money spent
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The writers are amazing! The story line is always changing and transitioning into a new twist you didn't see coming. Its smart and slightly comedic at the same time. Im just sad that I've watched all the episodes and am caught up because it was so much fun to watch back to back episodes and not wait a week to find out what happens next.
B001DB0HG2|5.0|I love Harry Potter and couldn't resist this book. A great read for any potter fan! Enjoy reading it everyone!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|There's magic in this story. One little boy finds allies and comfort in his bewitching neighbors who help him during a bewildering and frightening situation. This story will captivate the reader at the very first page.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I always enjoy AB, even though I am not good at it.<br />I think it's a de-stresser for me. Plus the grandkids love it.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game. I have it on my computer and I have beat it many times and I still just LOVE IT! I can play for hours and hours and not get bored once. When I saw that I could get it on my phone I instantly bought it. I am still just giddy with the fact that I can now play my favorite game anywhere. This is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I could give this game (and all the other Azada games too) I would give it an infinite amount of stars. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
0765325950|5.0|I really liked the wheel of time series and I think Brandon Sanderson did a good job finishing it up.  He wrapped up everything I wanted to be wrapped up and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room is an exquisite experience for those who love puzzles. It's a 3D jigsaw, maze, and hide-and-seek game all rolled into one. Examine, twist, turn, push, pull, rotate, and  repeat. Take your sweet time. Savor it. Use the hints only when you get stuck.<br /><br />I cannot wait to experience the next room!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it wish another one would come out. There could be a lot more to this story!!! Great series everyone should read.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I enjoyed John Corey's sense of humor. When in doubt, say something smart.  At the beginning of the story line seemed too long and drawn out before getting to meat of the story.  If you like the John Corey character, you would likely find The Lion and The Lion's Game a good read.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Game provides an increasingly more difficult puzzles to slove but I would say theres very little challenge untill the last 5 levels im on level 44 the final puzzle and it took me about an hour to get here. A very well enjoyed hour but leaves you wanting more.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|A fun, original fantasy story with a unique &#34;magic&#34; system. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|She is a good actress, I think that she did a good job. I do hope she does some  stage work. She plays the roll of an intelligent women very well. I don't think that she has done much in comedy,  She always comes off as a serious person in all of the rolls that I have seen her in. Is that possible.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Wow! Magical and mystical a world of its own. A unique circus setting from the late 1800 to early 1900. A touch of romance and imagery will keep you enthralled. I was captured  and could not put it down. I will be dreaming in black in white for many nights to come
B007USWCXS|5.0|Aki Kaurismäki just keeps getting it right! A beautiful story, a gorgeous movie, great acting. Have watched a few times already and will watch again.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a great series and I am happy to see it on Prime.  Wish season three were available now.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I'm a Professor of Modern European history. I found this book to be well researched and very captivating. It has its faults, of course, and may seem at times trite to a trained historian, but for the average reader is gives wonderful insights into the circumstance and experiences surrounding WWI.
B006PAV1XO|4.0|Compare this to royal tennanbaum.<br />Funny comedy, college and graduate students will love this, great movie characters. Entertaining for all.
1608871827|5.0|This artbook will satisfy all your PacRim world-building and backstory needs. The details included along with the high res pics will have me going over this with a magnifying glass to not miss any details! Besides the amazing sketches, kaiju anatomy, info from the cast and crew -  what really sells this book for me is the extras  - the detachable Jaeger blueprints, cards, stickers and it included 2 full size posters! Amazing art, details, stories with great add ins for fans! If you never get another artbook - get this! (Also, if out of stock here - can also get at The Book Depository - another book site which is also owned by Amazon)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really enjoy this series. Can't wait to see season two!!!!!! I like how the Alicia is strong and determined... 5 stars

B000FA5SMK|1.0|I can't believe the raves about this book.  It is awful !!  I read his really good books...\\"Mayday\\", \\"The Lion Gate\\" and the best.. \\"The Lion\\",  and this book is not worth 2 cents.  It is way too long, too boring, too little story line, I mean who cares that he stooped by a convenience store for some crackers ??  What happened to you DeMille...did your brain go limp ?  This should be a giveaway book for 4th graders except for the sex and profanity !  Pass this book by people !!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|i love this cd...memories and i listen to it over and over again. Really great price too.<br />Ellen Torre RN
0345529057|2.0|VERY disappointed with this edition.<br />Obviously the books/story are incredible, this review is specifically for the boxed bundle.<br /><br />At 800+ pages each, the books require quite a bit of page turning to read.<br />From just normal wear and tear of reading they fall apart at the seam. I have about 80 pages left on book two and 3 different clumps of pages have fallen out so I must juggle to keep them stationary as I read. Same thing happened with the first book.<br /><br />I would purchase a different edition of these if I were to do it again.<br />Very poor binding quality.

B007WPM7SO|3.0|I generally find Masterpiece Classics to be well worth my time.  This one was just so so.  I liked so parts of this movie, while other parts were just OK.  That's the reason for my average rating.  Didn't rise to the occasion of Masterpiece Classics that I'm used to.<br />Definitely not for the younger set...Adults only.  Too graphic in nature...
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|I got this for free. I am sure glad I did not have to pay for this. No clue how to play. I even asked a young, smart computer savvy person how to play. She said it was dumb.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is fun. But needs a better way of getting more diamonds. I can not wait and see how far I will get in the game.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I can see it and use it, but my games are separate apps.  Gotta have facebook dont you know, kids?
B0054R6BFM|2.0|I won't feel the need to comment on the unrealistic characters or the message of this book (that if someone you know commits suicide, it's your fault). However, I must warn any and all teenagers who are experiencing depression to steer clear of this book. It is EXTREMELY triggering; I read it whilst I was struggling with some pretty intense clinical depression, and it helped me to develop suicidal ideation that, once strong enough, landed me on a psych ward. Please be careful with this book.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|This movie was a good sequel to the first GI Joe. Lots of fun continuing the GI Joe story. The idea of a global nuclear threat has been with us for a long time and will continue. A good reminder.<br />However, unfortunately Amazon still continues its increasing problem of reloading the movie at least nine times making the viewing of it disruptive and tedious at best.
1451695195|5.0|Very inspiring story.  Well written, so it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Can't stop at the end of a chapter, need to read another.  Loved it!

B0063IH60K|5.0|I absolutely love this game!  It is particularly encouraging to be able to select the type of dealing you wish.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I really enjoyed Captain America. I would give it 5 stars, were it not for the unnecessary profanity. captain America is a real breath of fresh air compared to most recent hero stories. any more. The heroes are all portrayed as so broken, so dysfunctional, so self-absorbed, so entirely unimpressive, it is hard to believe they are capable of getting themselves out of bed in the morning, much less saving the day. Captain America on the other hand, is the kind of humble, honest, selfless hero that you can really look up to and say, &#34;I want to be like him&#34;.

B004H83IG4|5.0|I had seen this movie previously and loved it so I wanted to share it with other<br />people I know.  The only place I could find it was on Amazon and it was very quick<br />to arrive which was another plus for Amazon.<br /><br />This move in my opinion and those whowatched it was dramatic, intriguing, full of<br />twists and turns and just an all around good move.  Of course, Ryan Gosline is my<br />fav. actor also.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It starts out as a basic party in Vegas where the heroine meets the main guy, and then chemistry starts building between them and they wake up married. There's a tug of war between the couple as the heroine and the guy take turns rethinking the decision to stay married or to get a divorce. At the end it left me wanting more about their relationship and the guy protecting the heroine against her cousins' thoughtless words that were hurting her. When he defended her it made me fall in love with the main guy, because that's a real hero.
B008602KQI|5.0|I am not one to normally  read  a series of books, however, I actually got into the Hunger Games and had to make mysef read it before the actual movie came out.  I was already expecting to be disappointed because the movie never goes along with the book,, and WOW it actually followed the story line .  I have already finished the second book and I am anxiously awaiting the movie release to see how that compares, and i just started the third book. so HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY...
B005HEQ4XQ|4.0|Really enjoyed watching this season after so many years.  I remembered bits and pieces of some episodes, while others were like I had never seen them before.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Having been a \\"fan\\" of Reza Aslan since reading his first book, \\"No god but God\\", I downloaded \\"Zealot\\" on the day it was released.  As I live outside the United States, I was somewhat taken aback by the \\"controversy\\" surrounding it. After all, Aslan is a recognized scholar and I have always found his writing to be well balanced and imminently fair. This book is no exception. Rather than write an extensive review, I will limit myself to simply quoting the last two sentences in it, as they pretty well sum up both why I like the book and what I think of it:<br /><br /> \\"... the one thing any comprehensive study of the historical Jesus should hopefully reveal is that Jesus of Nazareth - Jesus the man - is every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy as Jesus the Christ. He is, in short, someone worth believing in.\\"<br /><br />I cannot imagine saying it any better than Reza Aslan did.
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|I didn't expect much from this movie because I saw the first G.I. Joe. Unfortunately, I'm still wondering why... how...? Nothing in this movie makes sense. From the very beginning, nothing made sense. Nothing was evenly remotely believable - I mean the plot, don't even think about the action and fight scenes. If nothing else, the final scene with the Rock shooting a pistol in the air at the end of a military award ceremony is enough to leave anyone scratching their head and wondering, \\"What the hell was that?\\" Anyway, if you're a 13 or 14 year old boy (I mean a normal 13 or 14 year old boy back from when I was a kid) you'll love this movie. If you've ever read the G.I. Joe comics or watched  the cartoon after school you might want to check it out. If for no other reason than to wonder why you used to think it was so cool for Snake Eyes to go around completely covered, head to toe, when it really just looks stupid now that you're old enough to think about it. If you want a good action movie or anything remotely considered a plot then this will be a big disappointment.

B00DC3DGSK|5.0|To say the electric blues is a passion of mine is to put it mildly. I listen to it constantly... watch videos of the legends... I attend concerts... and I research and read about it... and recently I'm very proud to say I've actually started an electric blues historical mentoring program through word of mouth. So when I state unequivocally that Buddy Guy is the greatest living electric bluesman... I don't do it lightly. The fact that Buddy is my favorite living artist will not affect my giving a completely honest review.<br /><br />I received Buddy's latest release \\"Rhythm & Blues\\" yesterday... coincidentally on his SEVENTY-SEVENTH-BIRTHDAY. If anyone on this planet has found the fountain of youth... at least when it comes to a singing voice... and the strength and dexterity of the fingers that bend the oh-so-heavenly-strings-of-an-ELECTRIC-BLUES-guitar... Buddy Guy has not only found it... he has jumped in head first and immersed himself with this magical electric blues elixir... and thank the Lord... it seems to be indelible in every molecule of his body and soul.<br /><br />This double CD is testimony to the fact that hardly any man alive has such a powerful voice that was simply pre-ordained to sing and feel the blues. If someone were to say his voice is that of a man half his age... I would challenge someone to produce a few of these blessed individuals. When it comes to guitar sound... if you are a real... real... student and lover of the blues... you also know that only a select rarefied few in history... such as **ALBERT KING**... *STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN**... have a guitar sound that you cannot only identify immediately after just a few string bending notes... but those same few notes... make the hair stand up on the back of your neck... and goose bumps rise to attention on your arms. Well, Buddy has attained that status while still walking on the face of this earth. This entire CD has Buddy's telltale... \\"HEAVY-STRING-BENDING-REVERBERATING*... call to arms... and he wields his powerful axe... as if he's bringing a flame thrower to the place.<br /><br />A few examples of Buddy's perfect melding of blues... his life... and his aspirations... can be felt in the following ways: mentioning Muddy Waters... and B.B. King... getting after women... regardless of his age... whiskey... love for his Mother... defining... and redefining the blues... and...<br /><br />A song entitled \\"I Came Up Hard\\"... that I personally identify with... and if you know Buddy's real life story... you'll know why he does too.<br /><br />And how can you not absolutely love a song that has all the following references in it... Windy City... Chicago... Halstead Street...  Comiskey Park... Wrigley Field... Soldier Field... Al Capone... T-Bone Steak... and the blues! (\\"Meet Me In Chicago\\")<br /><br />And now a few personal comments that doesn't change the FIVE-STAR rating... but just cleanses my electric-blues-soul.<br /><br />The song \\"Messing With The Kid\\"... is way... way too short. It's as short as a 45 RPM record from fifty years ago. Kid Rock and Buddy just start cooking and it's over. By the way... what a great duo that would be for a whole album! The last song on the first CD \\"Rhythm Inner Groove\\"... is 34 seconds long and shouldn't have even been put on there in the first place. On the song \\"What You Gonna Do About Me\\"... Beth Hart takes up where she left off with Joe Bonamassa... and rockets even higher! \\"Evil Twin\\"... with Steven Tyler and ?friends?... is a double barreled growling blues masterpiece.<br /><br />I have been to numerous Buddy Guy concerts and am getting tickets to the one he has coming up in the bay area in a few weeks. I'm taking my son... to keep the true electric blues passed on to the next generation... and I'm taking my electric blues\\" mentoree\\".<br /><br />Buddy Guy is a once in a lifetime or two electric blues legend. Listen to him... see him... if you had a chance to go back and see Babe Ruth in baseball I'm sure you would!nd he wields his powerful axe... as if he's bringing a flame thrower to the place.<br /><br />A few examples of Buddy's perfect melding of blues... his life... and his aspirations... can be felt in the following ways: mentioning Muddy Waters... and B.B.

B004OEMRGI|5.0|Bombino is an amazing guitar player and one of the best live performers I've ever seen.<br />I initially bought Nomad, after reading about it in Rolling Stone, then went back and bought Agadez, which is his first CD. I love it. It sounds like the desert, open and clear--the first song, in particular. It doesn't matter that you can't understand the words; you can feel what he's saying.

Later it was learned that Ben was teasing and picking on Jacob, because he did not like him, Jacob was \\"not cool\\", Jacob is indicted, Jacob's parents face the worst nightmare, but his father is determined to defend him no matter how, a trial ensues with Court action and emotional drama as the Prosecution team members in charge happen to be Jacob's father former job peers.<br />The plot is solid and rational and the story well written, the author merges his professional experience as a District Attorney with his passion for writing, keeps the same level of tension every step of the way, up to the ending chapters where the book takes an unexpected turn leading to its striking closure
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Cinematography was well done, cgi effects blended well.  Storyline has been used before but as usual skillful acting and thoroughly twisted plot will keep you guessing as to what has gone on and how it leads up for the climax.  Couple of scenes drag part of the plot down bu still overall good intertainment

B00498YZH8|5.0|I had watched Hunger Games, just because, as it's not typically a genre I would watch but Jennifer performance keep me watching. Few days later I came across another film titled &#34;House at the end of the street&#34;, and while viewing it, the young actress seemed familiar to me and I realized it was Jennifer Lawrence, what a different look than in the Hunger Games. That was a good film too and then I search to see what other movies she had done and stumbled upon &#34;Winter's Bone&#34;. Again a great performance and love the story. Would recommend the film especially if your a fan of Jennifer's.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Phenomenal. I am a huge James Bond fan and a student of World War 2. Some reviews have pointed out anachronisms but I didn't find any. I think these reviewers don't really know the subject. One reviewer said this was a `rip off' of early James Bond movies. Which Bond movie is set in World War Two and centers on the negotiation of France's navy?? There isn't anything ripped off here. I found this book to be beautifully written and utterly original. Author Stevenson's one-liners sound like something Bond might say but they are all original jokes (I laughed out loud at several, especially the scene at the `Ministry of Supply' chapter which was a wicked parody of the `Q' scenes) and every line is fresh and clever. I think some reviewers didn't really get it - this is a sly, tongue in cheek parody of Bond while also being a historical novel that holds up on its own. I loved the Nazi characterizations. It's so easy to fall into cartoon or stereotype but General Bock and Captain Speer read like fully dimensional individuals. The descriptions of the scenery and characters are outstanding. The prose is eminently readable - smart and evocative, without the use of flower language or obvious metaphors. Here's a typical example from the memorable chapter one sortie seeking the French fleet's hiding place:<br /><br />\\"Cotton was in his element, hotdogging around the towering funnels of the epic Strasbourg, careful to avoid the swivel guns of her deck and water line as he bobbed and weaved, windmilling and snapping outrageous half turns before rotating 360 degrees and ascending skyward with a barnstorming flourish. Gunners scrambled to man the skyscraper's 3.5 inch howitzers and its four barrel heavy machine-guns. But Cotton was too fast and gnat-like and by the time the brigadiers and bombardiers were assembled he was gone.\\"<br /><br />Simple, effective, moves the story forward.<br /><br />I wish more books were written like this. There is a lot of detail here, which is great if you like historical novels that showcase time and place. I think this is the whole point of a historical novel and so I loved every word. Needless to say, this writer is an expert at crafting action. The ski chase, the bomb attack on London and the boat chase are as good as if not better than anything by Ian Fleming. It's clear this author cut his chops in Hollywood.<br />I can't wait for the next book by this incredibly talented writer.you like historical novels that showcase time and place.

B00005UWUL|5.0|This is a wonderful movie with wonderful acting.  Sad that there are so many people who have never seen it.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|It took a while to pick up steam, but once it got going, the movie was good.  Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis were well casted, but the other characters could have been played by any generic actor.<br /><br />A few exciting action scenes made by jaw drop open as I wondered, \\"how did they do that?\\"  The wire scenes on the mountain particularly stand out.<br /><br />Without spoilers, I can say that the story was exactly like every episode of the cartoon of long ago. Cobra has an evil plot and only the Joes can stop them.  Surprise!  They do exactly that.

B00594M53M|2.0|Really slow and boring.  I rented it on a whim, since I am travelling to Paris next month.  The story line is quite predictable and uninteresting, and sadly the scenery is not done justice to either.
