B000VPNGEQ|5|Easy install. Works great.
B001O0CI3M|3|Looks good at first but they chipped after a month
B00STXFOK6|5|good item
B009LZSYZS|4|Works as advertised. A little brittle (this is my second one). Made of plastic so go easy on the excessive door opening force.
B006C1NBMA|3|Didn't work.
B00KMB6G1E|3|So far they've held up. However, they seem a little flimsy to me which I don't like. Also the 120xp mechanism seems inconsistent in the sense that some feel very smooth and others feel &#34;crunchy&#34;. Also I haven't found much need for the spline style head but I guess it's a nice touch. I have reversable ratchet wrenches also made by gearwrench that I greatly prefer over these.
B0012TRO70|5|This is quality stuff never disappointed
B00HS1HOFI|5|No issues at all.  Does require removing the steering wheel, though, all you do-it-yourselfers.
B002IQ8VMI|5|Amazing!!!!
B00EC0Z874|5|Perfect fit, and easy installation!
B0012TT8OM|5|Just what was ordered, a bit ordoriforous!
B007TZ9C08|5|Just as described
B000GTUM9O|4|nice looking, could be a little more rugged, but did the job for the price
B007KCZ3TY|5|Everything looked good and installed easily<br />Works great
B00CO853RG|5|Nice ....would buy again
B00HTOB0NG|5|Worked great
B0064FXRWI|5|Been only 3 weeks but they are bright yellow and are visibly yellow from the car. Looks great in my '10 Si
B00MQEIRTO|3|Received bulb quickly and installed them. The fit isn't quite right. Had to pull off the O ring to get it into the light housing and then I had to work with it to get the retaining clips to lock in. I'm not completely sure that both clips are locked in or not. Its holding in place. The wire connector didn't clip in very well either. I had to work with it also for it to lock into place. I guess that's what you get with Chinese tolerances. The bulbs are installed and working for now.
B00HQZ9PVM|4|Installed on our boat, we have to disable it if we leave the boat closed up for several days as it seems to detect the battery charging gases as CO.<br /><br />Easy setup and install.
B000C57U88|5|Great coil spring.  my old Volvo loves it.
B003ZJ19EY|5|Looks great on the truck!
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I have really enjoyed this shade.  It fits in my windshield much better than the old &#34;accordion&#34; type blocker, and covers the entire thing.  It also folds down smaller, making storage extremely convenient.
B00B25JZJO|5|Fit nicely!
B00503L2ZE|5|Great replacement part, fit as expected and comes with replacement top nuts. I will order this again when the other side needs it.
B005HH62BC|3|good
B001B71EXI|5|Exact fit on a 1997 Aston Martin DB7 i6 at a fraction of the price the dealer charges.
B003AS99DI|3|it's ok for now.
B007G03NP6|5|Very pleased
B008VPUC6I|5|Does what it's supposed to.
B00032K32A|5|just what i expected ..
B000C7Y3QI|5|worked great and came with clips for the rail !!
B00K9BFRSK|5|perfect item a must have for all disabled vech.
B001DKPOKW|5|Great for high temperature applications or where thick paint is necessary. I have used this in the past for calipers on several cars, it beats the color rust. This is a fairly thick paint that is resistant to damage and cleansers when allowed to cure. I used this purchase on a couple of old industrial compressors that were rusting, worked perfectly.
B0066QTXPU|2|Good
B005DUKGNI|5|Much better than my oem dome light thats for sure. Light is very bright which I like and also installation is very easy. Thank you.
B00T5G53ZM|1|Pairs fine with S4, S5 and TAB-S but can not connect at all to the unit using Torque on either a 2001 Altima or 2003 GMC. I have another older OBD unit that works fine on both vehicles. Want the second unit so that I would have one in each vehicle. Did not return it.
B00514ABY0|5|Purchased this for my 2015 H-D Switchback.  Very easy to install (no tools required) and really cuts down (almost eliminates) on the amount of engine generated heat that reaches the rider.  This is a great add-on to my bike.
B0002JMV06|5|help my truck run better
B00CSVCNW2|3|Although I ordered the listed Victorinox screwdriver, I am not sure that what I received is a genuine article.  The one I received arrived without any marked packaging, and it is the commonly seen angular screwdriver, unlike the round one pictured here.  Since it is not a really critical tool, I thought that I would just keep what I received.
B00DOS0PXC|5|Great price and fast shipping.
B000AME4VE|5|IT'S THE BEST BAG EVER!!!  ONLY found on Amazon!!!
B008ESJX58|5|Great product, just like the original part. Installed in no more than 10 minutes.
B004BC4K72|4|Just what I needed. It works.
B00JLASS4A|4|I would give 5 stars but I had to use my old buttons because the new ones would get stuck every time I tryed to use them. I love the pink though.
B001TNFFBG|5|My f250 is a work horse but towing a gooseneck or hauling anything over 2000 pounds in the bed it would sag and feel unstable. This is the fix! Rock solid towing gooseneck without an rocking or hitting bump stops on rough roads. I put 5600 pounds of concrete  in the bed and it sat close to level and took it great!  My limitation is only how much the tires are rated for now.
B00GDGF0DC|5|Nice!  Good value compared to BMW luggage.
B00NBN1C78|5|A very useful complete tire changing kit that includes everything you need to get the job done, the components are strong and sturdy and will stand up to use very well.
B000NOBIFO|1|its not sheep skin
B00P2VW9LK|5|Saved me a ton of money.  Fit perfectly.
B001DCC6YM|1|I ordered this kit for my truck, it came with two Drivers side front mounting brackets...returned it for another set, and the same thing occurred. After getting a rude response when I directly contacted the manufacturer, I ended up returning the kit for my money back.
B00FAICI7K|5|It was what the descriptions said it was and I'm pleased with it.
B00009PGNS|5|I got a refurbished. Solid little cooler. Glad I bought it.
B00AQFE4PQ|5|Awesome set!  What every Jeeper needs in his glove box/center console.
B000BGJX88|5|It was brand-new still in the package. It works perfect. It installed in minutes and it save my vacation trip made it wonderful time in Yosemite. My having a workable sink. Thanks again
B0002SRCK6|5|I haven't had the occasion to use any of the tools but they all look good.  I don't anticipate any problems.
B001C6NC7O|5|I am a contractor, I use this hose in 0 degree weather and it's still flexible, I use it on hot roofs and it works great, it's lighter than my fully rubber hoses, I am buying these any time I have to change out a old hose...
B00R53P2ZS|5|Fit and works great
B000C2YCH8|5|Perfect fit!
B000IYZLPM|5|good price
B006WPQNB2|5|Worked well out of the box. Putting the batteries in was a bit difficult.  We've not used it enough to evaluate function.
B009EA9BZM|5|Great looking mirrors, very good quality, exceptional customer service. Unfortunately they were ordered for a 89 Ford ranger and didn't fit. The company was exceptional in how they handled the problem. Would recomend this company and their product.
B00FVZE1RC|5|great they stand by there products  I'm having fun  on my boat thanks
B000JQQQKS|2|Ripped apart fairly easily, I'd avoid using these for anything weighing something a toddler can't carry.
B00BB6LN9O|5|very nice grips
B008MQ38EY|5|Excellent product runs great and was easy to install . Got to keep the Grandchildren happy , so I rely on Amazon and their Affiliates to keep me Happy . Greatest place to shop . Thanks Amazon ....1 Happy Customer
B001KQF6CK|1|Don't line up but looks exact.
B0013JVYY8|5|Works great
B00IUWM59O|5|good
B00JA3BMDW|5|For the price, this temp gun really does a good job!  It gives a great approximate reading to 1/10th of a degree, and even has settings for different surfaces.
B002UX7I9G|3|Replacement of OEM bulbs with these was simple, however I did not notice any benifit. Did not notice an increase to emitted light to improve distance visibility.
B010H0QV7S|5|This is a good and valuable emergency tool to have in your car, and it comes at a very reasonable price. The tire pressure gauge shows the pressure reading in digital format, no more worries about having to read the correct pressure on the old fashioned gauge dial. The gauge measures tire pressure in 4 types of units: PSI,BAR,KPA and KGF/CM2, accurate to +/- 1 PSI. The tool also have an emergency glass-breaking hammer and a seat belt cutter, two tools that I think are extremely important to have with ready access in your car, you never know when you might need it and in that situation, you'll be thankful for having this tool handy. Of course, I hope you never have to use it for these purposes. The incorporated flashlight is a bonus. The device requires 2 AAA batteries (not included).
B000CLMCC6|5|good performance
B00XULVDHK|5|These shades have stayed on my windows.  I had another brand and had no luck at all keeping them on the window.  When I first got these, I thought they could have been a bit taller but, after having used them a while, am convinced that they are a good, versatile size.  And, if I do need to move them, I don't have to worry about them never going back on.  They do!  They included suction cups for additional stability, but I haven't used them because I haven't needed them so far.  I appreciate the reliable product and I know my son would say that he appreciates the break from the intense Texas sun!
B00T6JDUVC|5|Makes a very good addition to your high beams, they have a sort of X shaped light pattern with a flat bottom. Now if you turn them over you will find a good cut off beam that you can use with your low (dipped ) beam, much better than a fog that has a thin spread of light, this gives a block of light that fills in between the cut off, back to the vehicle. On my motorbike it is almost as good as a JW Speaker low beam headlight. They make OSRAM Night Breaker Unlimited H4 Halogen Bulbs look brown.
B0002SR4Q8|3|received in a timely manner. After using it once I realized that it work great for filter removal but NOT for installation!<br />I know that you are supposed to only hand tighten the filter but I prefer to give it an extra quarter turn and i had to use my old pipe wrench to do that!<br />I am considering returning it.
B007Q0K4OY|5|I have a Polaris predator 500. So far so good. The chain hasn't stretched.
B006B2YZ9I|4|Have gotten this before for different vehicles, very good!
B007VHBGIU|1|i only got the package the emblem was missing .. empty bag only
B003Z9WMWC|4|Good cover for the price!! A little noisier than would like but for the cost worth it!!
B005GAH1XI|1|On one of the strips, only 3 LEDs actually emitted light.  If you purchase, know that it may be a gamble and a waste of your time.
B001AWFR8W|5|Everything arrived well<br /> I am a customer and I will continue buying amazon in Mexico and the United States<br /> thank you
B000CF6RXM|5|I've had them for a month now and no issues.  They stay in place and work great.
B00316K61S|5|Works good :)
B000CMJ2QE|5|These are as advertised. Great material that will last forever and make me feel confident that they will add another level of protection for my wheels.
B00PXW3Z5C|5|Excellent quality
B00IVOU87C|1|The sizing on this is ALL WRONG! I ordered a 3x because I normally wear 2x shirts. The tag on the vest says 3x BUT it looks like a 1x. This is a HUGE disappointment.
B003VWNB6Y|5|Exactly what I needed.  These work great in 2013 Fiat 500 Turbo/Abarth to replace the white DRL/Park bulbs with Amber for a more unified look.  They match the factory turn signal color perfectly!  Thank you!
B00R3OEQ60|5|hoping that it will outlast the normal stock filter
B00IH1QKT4|4|really cute but hard to get on the antenna
B001YJ5RL8|5|works great
B00ATZFD12|5|Ok
B00ZGVSIOI|2|Doesnt fit properly,sit above roof about a quarter inch
B00062YUUS|5|This Meter is required for restoring British Racing Cars from the 50 to the 70.  The Actron get the jop done right the first time around and every time.
B0048DP2IA|5|This is perfect for AZ hot.
B0009IQZH0|5|Work great!
B0012BJW6O|5|i love it...as expected
B0023V99N8|4|Easy to install but did NOT come with the screw extensions so that was a problem.
B005FYJ5B6|4|look long to arrive but like the product well worth the wait
B00JHOHBNY|5|Fit my son's truck well. Easy installation and came quickly.
B009B0YAK6|5|All items just what I wanted!
B00LF7TPQM|1|I was putting on my car left it for three min and followed the instructions but I'm just wiping off the paint that I just coated on. I love my car that's why I bought something expensive just to take the dings off but I feel like I just got ripped off. I am not sure if they sent me a defective product cuz it does happen. But I wish they would give me a better product that is not defective like this.
B003E3QG8U|5|Marvelous, looks like a new vehicle, will buy again.
B00CSHYHH0|5|Great Air Filter.. been using it on my bike for more then a year. cleaned it once and put it right back.
B00LK4XTKS|5|i love it...as expected
B00480N0SC|5|Bouggt as replacement bulbs and are excellent. They are super bright
B00V4049K2|5|Very pleased with this product.
B009DK202O|5|It fit perfectly on my brothers 94 K1500, it's a bit lighter then the original and in some areas it might require clip, great price.
B0031ZDU62|5|Great product.  My 2002 F-150 runs like new again.
B00062ZMSC|5|Fit perfectly and horsepower picked up as well.
B0016ITCVS|4|The part is exactly as described very happy with product and Amazon fast shipping
B000CNGTZU|1|http://www.summitracing.com/parts/exp-55590b<br /><br />THIS KIT ONLY CONTAINS LOWER CONTROL ARMS AND BUSHINGS.. THAT IS IT.!
B006X8BZ1G|1|Piece of junk, return and had to pay the freight.<br />Ripoff!!!!
B000BO4WU4|5|good deal and fast shipping.
B000COBLG6|5|Just what I expected
B000CO9QBI|4|back to squealing tires!
B00OXPXUAK|5|It works great
B000CO9OTM|4|Better ride than factory strut.
B002X55TRE|5|Easy to apply
B00B49YMXC|5|Great quality product and great service
B0002U2V1Y|5|Amazing price, amazing product
B000U3TTN6|5|Just what the doctor ordered.
B0092P19T0|1|The packaging was broken at the creace & the items are scratched up. My new 2015 car would not look very nice with this item as it is. I guess you get what you pay for.
B0080DLA9E|4|They are the same bulbs as the OEM bulbs just with a different name. Buy these if you want the same bulbs for 1/3 of the price the dealership is trying to charge.  Brightness is better than the old bulbs in the vehicle.
B00480J4UK|2|As yellow as any other halogen. My car has 4300k HID headlights, but halogen fogs.  I hate the color mismatch.  HID fogs would melt the lenses, I tried LED which matched OK, but did not throw much light down the road and didn't last long.  I got these hoping the &#34;up to&#34; 4000k looked like my 4300k headlights.  Nowhere close, and they look as yellow as the OEM bulbs.
B0031ZDU62|5|ha ha finnaly fixed.
B00C3AIOTY|5|Have these on my 2013 Sonic rs. Fits great and easy to install by using the existing fender screws and poking some holes in the flaps. I have seen a reduction in the amount of dirt on the side of the car, so they work great as well.
B00K4Q3WE6|1|Didnt fit my H11 fog lights.  Threw them away. Waste
B00996KZFG|5|Love the sticker! It was everything I expected. It took me back to the days of being in a Air Defense unit.
B00DTDCCMO|5|Easy installation, looks great! Sounds so much better than the stock muffler...but still very quiet with the baffle inside it.
B00KTJ0LRE|3|This is kinda out there...but you need to know that if you own a 2011 or later GMC/Chevy you're going to be making a trip to the dealer or locksmith to have your key fob programmed.  Also the keys I got were too long to be cut and fit my GMC.  I own a 2012 GMC Sierra.  Amazon was great and gave me half my money back because of the keys...I couldn't do a full replacement because I paid for the fobs to be programmed.  So you might want to start with the keys first if you want all your money back...I will just get the keys somewhere else.
B0002F9YIC|5|this cleaner is amazing use it on my leather chairs and couch
B001AY2WLU|4|lots of really good functions, but is really small... it fits on a keychain
B0006SH4PA|5|Great stuff. ..
B000VJSQ5Q|5|works great
B00SZADFD6|5|loved it
B0039752R2|5|I used this product to reseal my headlights on my car.  After taking apart my headlights a few times it was recommended that I add some sealer to the lights.  I applied this product around the sealing portion of my headlights, heated the headlights up and pressed the two parts together.  3 years later my headlights are moisture free.
B000TYVL5U|5|Replaces old cap
B001J5WXDC|1|Should have listened to the other reviews. Same here, fuel sending unit defective. The truck runs fine but the gas gauge doesn't work correctly.
B00DT7UF60|3|did not tell me the number of wires changed so it did not work
B00PV37ZEA|5|It arrived quickly, just as advertised.  Thanks.
B004HII1G6|5|These are great!  Look nice and easy to install.
B00P0Q62NS|5|As advertised, fit perfectly on my 2015 CRV
B002IVCTDK|2|Although this holds a wine glass well, it requires you to remove your existing can holder to use the raw opening. I thought the product would insert into a can holder. That is not the case, it would not fit in standard can holders. The spring tabs that lock it in are very stiff and would make it impossible to remove if you can not access the underside (which is the case in our pontoon boat arm rests). Maybe it would fit directly into a wider container holder.
B007TYA55K|5|Bolted right in! Then I wrecked my car:-(  But this was a fine replacement part!
B00IKSRTBM|5|These fit perfectly into the space I already had when I was rewiring my trailer.  The old lights were old and failing.  This is nice and works well.  Plugged it in and worked great!
B00SZK1420|5|Bulbs are good match the headlights perfect
B00HCMMAUW|5|The right part thank you
B00LEUQSLK|5|Great product
B00069QLVC|4|Works like advertised.
B0097YH972|5|Installed this in my boat to replace an old plastic holder.  It is heavy duty and real quality.  Works great for regular cans, bottles and travel cups.  No it WON'T hold a big gulp but who drinks those anymore?
B00C5CQYY2|4|Quality Product! Fits 2015 Ram 1500 well. The screw holes were slightly off.<br />Comes with tailgate cover! Fit great!<br />The port hole covers are tough to put on but over all great product for a great price!
B000JYWY38|5|The seller had many choices to choose from.<br />The part itself is very well made and was a exact fit. Would recommend this seller<br />To those looking for a quality<br />Water pump.
B00PJPHEBO|4|I had the chance to try this out and once you get it working it's pretty nifty. But I find that in my Ridgeline I have to attempt to plug it in several times before my phone will connect to the bluetooth signal. Once I DO get a connection it works very well, but if I don't get that connection I have to remove it and reconnect it several times. Eventually it always works but it isn't a sure thing each time I connect it.<br /><br />The data it returns is interesting and real-time using the free apps in the apple and android app stores. If you need diagnostic info, I would recommend this, for the price it works well. I wish it would always work the first time when I plug it in.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would write a review about it. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.”
B000VBGZEI|5|Fit perfect.nice and high
B00AEUQEAQ|5|Definitely a great product
B00ABW68OE|4|It's a little hard for plastic of this size to maintain its shape, so don't expect crazy rigidity. It's not exactly floppy, but it isn't what I'd call rigid. The rear lip is molded upwards which was a surprise to me but upon reflection it makes sense -- that's how you keep spills from falling out the back. Makes sense. I'd buy it again.
B00DSA1CK6|4|This is a much safer way to carry my oxygen tanks in the car.  My main concern is that  the clasps attached to the bag are plastic.  If I'm in an accident will the tanks  break loose and come flying at me?  I would love to see them change to metal clasps.
B000ZIZHKK|5|This set was a life saver, after reading several review on the other sets and not wanting to take a chance on the cheaper sets I settled on these. I installed them around 3 months ago and have not had any issues. I bought these to do a 175K mile tune up on my F150. After installation of these and new plugs my truck is running great. I would usually go OEM, but the price on these are half of the price on the Motorcraft ( online, dealer prices you might get 2 for this price) And I felt confident that MSD would deliver and was not disappointed.
B001O0X9JO|5|very pleased fits well in my suv
B00KVVBEWQ|3|So basically this is a crippled tablet that only does GPS and comes with a car mounting kit.  The screen is great very easy to read.  However the interface is confusing.  Battery life is too short.  It's hard to know why there are still dedicated units like this one.  Magellan is clearly struggling to come up with a purpose by incorporating RV features.  I plan to use this on an RV trip next week and will update this review.  So far it is ho-hum.
B0043E3BOQ|5|Works great! I used it on 2 1/8&#34; inch exhaust pipes. I did seal all around it with exhaust cement. Holding together just fine so far.
B00HQUFH7S|5|If you're looking for a factory size decal this is the one... I've bought several decals from undergrounddesigns before and they have exceeded my expectations yet again... Very proud to have this on my Jeep. Used to be the lame silver and now gloss white and looks like it was meant to be there.
B00AQFED70|5|Great bumper. Solid and sturdy. Super fast shipping. Awesome service!
B00MHYCCYE|5|I put this on my jeep and haven't taken it off since I got it.
B000E2CVT2|5|Fits for my 2011 Kawasaki ninja 250 R. Works as expected.
B00H36XX6C|5|Best flashlights I've ever owned!  I loved the one I originally had so much that I ended up ordering three more.  The batteries seem to last &#34;forever&#34;. It seems like you can use them (light usage) off and on for about a year without needing to recharge.  Battery life is measured in years, not days or months!  The light is bright and effective.  The square shape actually works extremely well (fits your hand beautifully and stays where you put it when you put it down).
B00D8BFJP4|5|I would like to order more
B00BB15BK6|5|I have owned over 60 cars and these are the best liners that I have ever purchased. The fit and the quality are excellent !
B00QNRIN0I|4|I needed the cut outs for the tags on the liscence plate to be on the bottom, so I can't use these.  But they are great frames and I would love to be able to
B0049EP3NM|5|the right product at a great price to help keep my 2005 Grand Caravan moving down the road.<br />Just remember to torque the pan bolts correctly with a new gasket in place.
B004HO4MT0|5|Exactly like original.  Perfect fit. Easy to install
B00H7JEQAM|1|Could have purchased it from Solid Signal for $ 38.49
B008FZB5CO|5|Exceeded my expectations!
B00VPJ81LK|5|The key fob really accents the Tesla key and stands out . I just wish they had designed the key fob so that the front goes first and the rear was where the keys are attached.
B00TY3BCH4|5|Fits 2004 Nissan Sentra 1.8 like a glove. Comes with silencer already installed and sounds great.
B00BJBNKJM|5|Great looking lights. Even came with bulbs!
B001G6PU0M|5|installed on a 81 rabbit pickup 1.6 liter non turbo diesel. great price and great fit. drops right it
B004YMU9KG|3|These are pretty thin plastic detailing items, I wouldn't say that they are anything fantastic, and I am not sure how long they will hold up. However, I do like the way they look on my tail lights. I would prefer they be made of a different material, and they definately needed to come with instructions and better material with which to secure them to the tail lights. I bought 3m mounting strips on a roll, and have used about have the roll filling in the spaces which have plastic to adhere them to my tail lights.
B00QFIIDI2|5|Very nice. Keeps coffe hot!
B001DKRF2M|5|All good. I read the comments and was very worried to read that the product did not come with instructions. I also looked the internet for instructions on installation, and it's true, they are not anywhere to be found. But the I got the product and it DOES have an instruction manual. It explains everything. How to connect the alternator, the two batteries, which wires are to be replaced, what circuit breakers and fuses to be used, and it also contains an easy understandable how-to-install step by step guide. The guide also has an installation test section, to check that everything is working fine. The product is mounted on my vehicle and working fine on a 80 Amp Toyota alternator with two identical 1100 amp batteries.  - November 2015 update -  Still no problems. Made a 3000 Kmts trip and both batteries are still good and charging. Tried the isolator with only one battery simulating an emergency procedure, and no problems at all. Mounted two LCD voltage displays in the inside of my vehicle and I can see when the isolator kicks in (battery voltages go from aprox. 12.7 to 13.5-14 volts.) and I can monitor when one battery is close to discharge when I use it with my engine off (Ideal for camping). Isolatro effectively does what it is supposed to do. When one battery is draining out the other one will hold the charge. Then in the morning I am able to turn on the car even if the auxiliary battery was drained.  Make sure you use the right cable gauge, or go to a professional for correct installation.
B008JPV6ME|4|Although I did not install this myself, my dad said it was good, so I'm kinda reviewing this on his behalf, so to speak. He did say he had a slight problem fitting it in, so I asked him, and he said four stars out of five.<br /><br />As far as the car, it's been several months, so I guess it did the trick.
B00Q34AJ0S|5|came earlier van expected like a dream went on simple
B001O7I7FS|2|Man, This stuff left my headlights really cloudy. I used the sanding pads (which hardly did anything after an hour of wet sanding) and then buffed with plastix and the buffer for another 30 minutes. Mind you this was only on one headlight.
B00YMVQVLK|2|There are no mounting brackets. only nuts and bolts it looks like you have to drill thru the the PEDALS? NO WAY !
B002M4GF38|5|Fit perfect. Works great, now we can see at night again.
B000JFJLP6|5|Outstanding. Hard to believe
B000XBBISO|5|my toilet would continue running and overflowed a few times not knowing. I was going to take it to the dealer to repair, then decided to just look up the toilet brand and looked up the valve assembly.  Very easy to change out 15-20 min and now good as new! So glad i did it myself!!
B00028FB8G|5|LOW price and very FAST delivery,just what I wanted AND needed!! Thank you!
B00OA66KKO|4|Works like a champ!
B004RNOVTM|5|New hose for me, love it!!
B006ULI1QI|5|Great looking decal. My wife loves it
B002J7VX4Y|5|Smells like a new car spray & fast delivery!  Thx
B004GFTC0E|5|This restored the headlights on my 2007 Prius to brand new.  It's a bit disconcerting to take sandpaper to headlights; but the instructions are well written and tell you what to look for at each step.  The final polishing is where it all came together.  Super shiny, even slippery headlights.  It does wonders for the overall look of the car.  It took me about 45 minutes total.  Highly recommended.
B00ESBOL3E|4|Good light bar. Built well, no sign of condensation yet,but it is a $70 light bar so we will see. DOES NOT come with all the wiring you need. Not even sure why they would say that, but pick up a $15 relay harness and you're golden. Very bright.
B007JWDWCA|5|Felt great for shifting gears. Looked even better. Cant really say anything bad about it at all it was great.
B0057PFJW2|5|They came before the date it looks great
B005OQYCKE|3|It's not a bad kit, I had to add a few things to it to make me feel better. It's great for like a &#34;my first car&#34; gift but meh
B00936PB60|5|Look great!<br />Excellent value
B003SZ75JS|5|Its look great
B000C5FL84|1|Also have an 04 Ranger and this cap will not work. Go to ford part web site enter your vin. number make and model and part 9030 FC 987 pops up Had to return because of someone mistake and I  am paying a return fee. Will not purchase auto parts again. Update according to Ford Dealer number has changed about 7 times. New parts number is FC 1079 for 04 Ranger with click type fuel cap.
B00166ZN90|5|Fit perfect first try. Took 20 minutes to install. Looks great. Shipping was very fast.
B00BISRU7O|1|Says it fits my 2001 Audi TT Quattro, but it doesn't. Pretty disappointed.
B001DX9YSW|5|ok
B006CSSKCO|5|works just as it's supposed to and was TOO easy to set up!
B00YVR8FFA|5|I mistakenly ordered the pan that didn't come with a pump & pickup & I am sorry if my previous review was off-base.
B00KDRXDFO|5|I got one of these for my wife's previous car & she loved it.  This one is just as good.  She loves dragonflies so it was perfect, looks really nice on the tinted windows.  Great decal.  It's nice that they include some smaller practice ones too so you're sure to apply it correctly.
B00280BL08|5|Very nice quality. Can't comment on their longevity yet, but these are much nicer than most lug nuts I've used in the past.
B007Y55KIG|5|This shade is a little more expensive than some but it actually fits and is made of nice sturdy material. I park in my driveway and we have many hot days in my neighborhood. Am truly amazed how well it works.
B00ANZHG4U|5|Good product :)
B001W8RS4A|5|Perfect fit and looks great on my girlfriends little Honda Rebel
B00L2PJNU0|5|Great OEM gas cap for my 2008 Kia Sorrento . Way cheaper than the dealer and its a Kia part .
B000JFL7ZS|5|Works great for removal of Oil filter cap and water separator filter cap.
B004MF95AA|5|Received this one time and it works great.
B00498OJ9W|5|Belt works great with my supercharged mustang. It's a very quiet belt.
B00BNIOH84|5|This fits my Illinois Tollway IPass perfectly.  This makes moving the IPass between two cars significantly more convenient.  As a bonus, you don't have adhesive backed fastener stuck to your windshield.
B00COOSF98|5|Works perfectly on my 2013 KIA Sorento EX. Just need to make sure to use the relay or it will kill your ECM.
B00IO4MDOU|5|Excellent quality and feel
B00413CNWA|5|Excellent bumper - not to heavy but built well. Looks great on the Chevy 2500HD with a 12k winch and a couple of large shackles attached.
B004ZF43Y0|4|They work great and are brighter then factory bulbs
B004RIOTGC|5|Heavy duty so it won't break. Nice.
B000YYTNCI|5|After much hesitation, I purchased and installed. Faster accelaration and pick up was noticed, especially at higher revs.Definitely a good buy to the daily driver.
B0015PK3AG|5|works great
B0049Z2WMQ|4|Quality parts!!
B0031GWMLU|1|don't work
B00CFALFXY|5|Nothing cleans dust like microfiber cloths, yet there are varying degrees of quality in the microfiber cloths I've purchased.  These by VibraWipe are the best I've found.  Will be buying more.
B000C30J1U|3|Decent but a little shorter than factory.
B00RMHUXHY|5|Perfect for rituals
B001EK912I|5|Ok
B002OP367I|5|Good fit
B0068FYF6Q|5|Great product, delivered as promised on time & in good condition
B00DPFIQBC|5|I thought it would be real nice but this is heavy duty and I am very pleased.
B001OMPJGS|5|Good replacement for stock jeep tj headlights.nice buy!!!
B00CHT5H28|5|just as listed
B001V8U12M|5|Well made. Way better than using the hand crank.
B005NLQAHS|5|Able to diagnose trouble codes on my vehicle (02-Isuzu Rodeo V6 3.2) and others on the fly.  It is being used with an Samsung S3 with the paid for version of Torque app.  I don't use it all the time, just when there are trouble codes on my vehicle and others.  This devise has not caused me any issues and works like advertised.
B00WZMMUSQ|3|probably should be included in the waste of maney catagory. fit well enough doesnt really improve a thing looks good under the hood
B004DRVVMW|5|Fit Like glove
B005CLMYOW|5|Went right in where the old handle came out, works perfectly!
B00DCF24W2|2|Feel great and look great but already wearing on finger tips after just a couple rides.
B000Q71N8K|2|This cooler does not perform as advertised.  It went along on a 3-day trip and the results were less than stellar. I thought that was because it was in a car with sunny windows in the summer.<br /><br />It is claimed that it will cool 40 degrees below ambient. After returning, as a test, it has been sitting in a 75 degree environment running empty for a couple of days and the inside only reaches 48 degrees. That's a 27 degree difference not a 40 degree difference. If it were used in an environment much warmer, it is doubtful it would cool noticeably at all. It was ought to replace a 12-year old Coleman that, until it suddenly died, actually did cool with a 40 degree+ difference. I will return this to Amazon and buy the Coleman again.
B00DKB2KCC|5|2001 Mitsubishi Montero sport xls fits like a glove,thank you.
B00U2CDJV8|4|This item appears to be well made and very compact. I gave it four stars because they advise only a four minute cranking time to avoid over heating the cables. Heavier duty cables would be a low cost solution. I purchased this for my wife but I will keep it in my car. I cannot comment on it's starting capabilities because our car batteries are in good shape. I bought my wife a Schumacher SL1. which does not have that 4 min. limitation.
B00IO95MY8|5|Happy with parts, only issue is the drivers side set screw was on wron side of lug to be able to use it, but minor issue.
B002LGF7C2|4|Really cool design but applying the individual letters was really tough. Its just a hard design for this type of sticker. Took almost an hour to get everything on but once I did it looks great and stayed on.
B000CPZT1S|5|solid material
B000C0YR1G|5|Perfect fit!
B004RNSO2M|5|quality
B00BYNJAVW|5|I have a 2004 chev. silveroto 1500 4 wheel drive fit great. I would bye them again
B000IHQLQW|5|well made. works excellent.
B007GRGUY0|5|Everything I expected, great looking easy install, easy adjusting when needed and a great ride.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Love it!  Works great as promised. Love JACO as they reach out to you to make sure that you are happy with their product.
B00UNTU3VO|5|I am a show car detailer and when it comes to detailing products, you have to pick the best ones. Working on very expensive cars you cannot make ANY mistakes. I have been looking at car dusters and so far I have been very discouraged about their performance in &#34;Dusting&#34;. The California Duster (probably the most well known duster today) has been OK overall. The problem is; if you do not know how to use that duster you will actually damage the paint on your car. You have to know how to use it.<br /><br />I decided to give this duster a try as it appeared to be sturdily built and the fact that it has a thick and long pile of Micro Fibers (MF) as the main source for &#34;dusting&#34;. I used another brand &#34;Carrand Microfiber Duster&#34; and their MF were very short and not &#34;thick&#34;. So I tried it this morning and compared it to my California Duster and the Carrand. My conclusion: GET THIS DUSTER and do not get any other duster....PERIOD!!! I actually threw the Carrand away. This duster pick up most of the loose dust and does not leave &#34;streaks&#34; like the California Duster does. The Carrand wasn't even in the ballpark and was worth the trash can. This duster is softer than the California Duster and wipes away dust significantly better and it does not leave that &#34;waxy&#34; film behind like the California Duster. Additionally, the build quality of this duster in better than both dusters I compared. It is now my &#34;go to&#34; duster. If you were ever hesitant to dust a Lambo or a Bentley or Rolls Royce; FEAR NOT with this duster. This duster will take off dust and will not scratch (if used like all dusters properly) and will not leave a &#34;waxy&#34; film when done. All I can say is BUY IT!!! BTW, I have been looking for another duster for quite a while. The ones that I have used were either trashed or I stopped looking as I would just use the CA Duster. It is so good to see that there is a SUPERIOR alternative to the California Duster. The California Duster has now been relegated as being my &#34;spare or emergency use&#34; duster.California Duster has now been relegated as being my &#34;spare or emergency use&#34; duster.
B00GSG6UZ4|5|Item fitted perfectly, and easy installment. Many of my friends have complimented how funny it is that I have it on my car.
B00TABU92O|5|Great Production
B00G9SB45M|5|I LIKE
B0012INQG4|5|So far so good, very loud.
B00HVV60HI|4|Works as expected...  I did not use the CD that came with the product, I just downloaded an app on my phone and worked perfectly...
B000CNLEBY|5|Perfect fit in my Kubota B8200DT tractor.
B00KFHZDQO|5|Looks great on my Bike. Been using them for more then a year now on my bike with no issue.
B0025OYEII|5|Perfect fit in Camry and inexpensive price.
B00LL6PK2K|5|Excellent tire pressure gauge..I like the illumination it has for dark nights when you can't see anything..very pleased
B00LBETGY0|4|Got this for a 2015 Silverado and it fit no problems, looks good and does not have the logo as shown in the photo.  The horizontal bars are prone to bending, so extra care is needed to keep from goofing them up.
B00496MAWC|5|A great product at an excellent price
B00KMJGDBE|3|Some of the crystals have already fallen out.
B001KSGJHE|5|Thanks perfect!
B0002HRBSU|5|Works perfect to mount on a tailgate cb mount. Needed this to get it running on my jeep.
B002Y20KWA|1|Light wieght, not substantial or the quality expected for the price.
B0002T8GK0|5|love it
B00E9W2PPS|5|perfect, thank you
B000VDX170|5|These animal print car mats are a good buy.  They arrived and looked exactly as they are pictured.  The are a heavy material and are well made.  I have been using mine for a while and they have held up greatly.  The colors have stayed true. I have been surprised that even though parts of these are white, even after every day use they have stayed looking good.  They seem to be a standard size and fit my car well.
B00Y5FBUWI|5|These came in and were a very red-ish purple, not like the color in the picture. The quality was good, and they actually came in SOONER than they said they would. Great price too. I will purchase from this company again soon.
B004KK553I|4|Great deal! I had a few jewels fall off but other than that I'm really satisfied with how they look on my car!
B0006IX87S|5|I purchased these for our camper since we have very high levels of iron in our outdoor water at home. This filter works wonders! We leave it on the hose that we use for our camper so we can use it at campgrounds for extra protection as you never can be sure of the water quality. I am definitely going to try it out with our pool next year.
B0002L682Q|5|Not sure what the negative reviews are about this, but this fits my '08 TL perfectly. Almost too perfectly. Provides shade on a day to day basis.<br /><br />The only minor issue I can think of is that since it's such a great fit, I have to sorta bend it at the top (bends against the natural folds of the shade) I could see in moving it multiple times against the natural folds, it might get worn out. Until that happens, this product stands at a 5 star!<br /><br />Too late for me, my dashboard already cracked at the passenger airbag. Highly recommended if you think your dash is about to crack. I'm willing to bet that this will save it from cracking if you order in time.
B0084H3O8Q|5|Very minimal, it doesn't look like the cheesy bumper stickers
B0046J3JHW|3|This is definitely a nice product, and for the money, I am totally satisfied, however, contrary to quad boss's website, this does not fit on the 2003 Kodiak 400 without modification. It is to wide. I had to cut about two inches off the inside to get it to mate up with the stock rack. Other than that, very satisfied.
B000WZ4KBS|3|Don't try to fit a 20' strap on this.
B00BQA3VD6|5|Worked great used with chemical guys cutting pad and swirls are gone!
B00BDEP5ZM|3|Doesn't control odor
B00IS94R8G|4|Easy install...fit is ok on my 2013 Nissan Armada.  Due to the fit over my mirror...I can swing the mirrors inward but they no linger swing outward because of the chrome cover.  They look good ...I like them.
B000C7S0TO|5|Received on time took out of box put in fit perfectly. I would recommend this to everyone.
B00301CF18|4|Durable. Had it for about a year and some months
B000TCCWS2|5|I used scissors to cut this down to fit in the small rear door window on our truck camper, and it provides a nice view of what's following us down the road via the windshield-mounted rearview mirror (or to make sure everything is secure if we're pulling our utility trailer).  The one thing to remember is that vehicles that look like they are 20' behind us in the lens, are actually only about 5' behind, so I check my other mirrors before switching lanes.<br /><br />This is an inexpensive fix for a limited view.
B0103FIHW4|5|These are very nice. Thick and very soft. They do a great job
B00M3F6PWM|5|A gift for my husband that he put on his work laptop.  He loves it!
B00559SAIU|3|BEWARE! If you are ordering this part for a G6 you NEED the plug adapter! We ordered this and the plug was the wrong one.
B000CMJ3JU|4|I was expecting a 100% stainless steel product, but this is steel covered in stainless.
B000WEMH4G|5|i love it...as expected
B00CASDZKC|5|Life changing especially when you have 3 kids and want to keep your car somewhat decent!
B0046BLGZW|5|fast service and a great product
B00TEA5PZC|5|I've been on the hunt to find a new license plate frame to replace the ugly ones that came from my dealer.  These ones are simple yet classy and match the rest of my car's stainless steel accents perfectly.  I love how it all blends in together - it's like it was made for my car!  The kit has everything you need to install.  The installation was extremely easy and my 12 year old son put this on my car all by himself.
B003YHMNP6|4|Better than I'd expect it!!!, this is a very good hvlp gun for that price. I might gonna order a couple more
B00GV84JIY|2|The color was light gray, nothing like the picture or description when I purchased. The color of the interior I have is much darker. The seller should be more detailed describing the color and use a more representative picture.
B0065UNPS8|5|Great product.  My 2002 F-150 runs like new again.
B001NHCFVQ|5|Great piece of equipment.  Several mounting options and functions well.  Need to waterproof if you are going to use in rain.
B000AL8VD2|5|great product
B0041C8XQG|4|These work well. I like that my hands don’t hurt anymore after riding for a few hours like they did with my old stock grips.
B00D3E1DA6|5|Very good filter and great price compared to other name brand filters out there. Easy to install, most cabin air filters are behind glovebox. Check out YouTube for videos for your car model on how to install. A lot cheaper to do it yourself vs car dealership. Will buy again.
B000GU0B5I|4|nothing spectacular. but works as intended.
B000C3XD90|1|I bought two, neither would screw all the way on.  K&n customer service and tech support is worthless....all I got was the runaround... I'll never purchase any more kn products.
B00GR6N4T0|5|I bought it to cover my rust, they fairly quickly. They weren't too hard to install, I had clauked the sides. And they look amazing. Definitely worth it.
B001NYFOSA|5|Although it's not pictured it DOES come with the water pump gasket. It's under the black plastic packing container. The timing belt tensioner has a key-pin in it to make the installation of the belt much easier than stock (you don't need the 1/8&#34; drill bit like you do on the stock Motorcraft tensioner) that looks like the key to a SPAM can. The timing belt tensioner also comes with a new bolt.
B00C9T3U0C|1|I hate to write this but this product was a piece of junk.  I bought this item to replace my pump in my 2005 Chevy Cobalt.  When I received my tracking number and looked it up I saw it was coming from China.  When i finally got the pump and installed it, it worked decently at first start up.  I filled the tank and started on a short drive to test the pump.  Ten miles later the car is sputtering and stalling resulting in a tow truck ride home.  Bear in mind I replaced the pump, fuel filter, and cleaned the tank prior to putting it all back together.  When I got the car home, we checked the connections and the seal to ensure that I put everything back together properly.  All good to go.  I then tried to start the car but all I got was a funny noise from the pump and barely any fuel at the rail.  Long story short, I ended going to the Chevy dealer and getting an OEM pump that cost me $672 but has not disappointed me yet.
B00TUKXRWO|4|Love it! Really really hard to put on though, almost sprained a finger lol
B00BITHNTI|5|This was the second time I bought this item. It didn't disappoint. I was able to install it even faster and by myself. The color match was also very good.
B009NMLLL8|5|Has been running great for a few months now
B00KY0ADFS|1|Finnaly my repair shop finnished my vehilce, As it turns out this alternator caused a surge in my electrical system and blew out my PCM now it is past the 30 days and i am stuck with a usless unreturnable alternator lucky me. Thank you so much for the short return time and no warrantee on a automotive part.
B000GU5IH4|5|I have a Yamaha YZ-1 and this cover has been great! It fits like a glove and has never blown off or failed to keep my bike dry. It has faded a little but for a whole year's worth of weathering, it's in pretty good condition! Definitely would buy again!
B00SDQQ26O|5|Perfect prank item!
B00IJO3R7C|4|Replaced an old unit with this. Nice newer upgrade even without instructions. Wire picture as instructions a little confusing but with a little common sense and powering up prior to install made simpler.
B0002TDUW4|5|It's pretty nice
B0009IQXAE|5|This product is great! I have to park my vehicles outside and between rain drops, bird drops, and various particles of bugs/dirt, this stuff keeps my car looking great in between washes. I use it pretty frequently and it is painless and efficient - just spray on, wipe once, flip towel, then wipe it off.
B006CCWC4W|5|It's motor oil that's very reasonably priced for amazon, and if you subscribe it's a great deal! I've done lot's of research about different oils and this one comes out on top. I have a 1986 Mercury Grand Marquis and it's very happy with this oil. The bottle is really easy to use as well, because it has two handles.
B0019LV3GO|5|Best on the market.
B0006305G0|4|Worked well. Little difficult to shorten. Great service and delivery.
B00NX1B8RM|5|As advertised, they look great...  just love them
B00BQN5SUW|5|Excellent!! Now I don't have to worry about my trunk taking my head off.
B004C20ZRK|1|These pipes look good, but the heat shields are only painted black.  If you get them wet and the pipes are hot they shields will rust.  The pipes themselves also get rusty, especially the flanges that hold them to the engine.  The rust is not covered by warranty.  I installed mine in February and started riding in May, and I have already had to repaint them.  I used the VHT brand of paint.  It is ceramic based.  Save your money and but the Vance and Hines if you want the black pipes.  The Freedom brand are also good.  I have not had any probles with the Cobra air filter or the fuel modulator but the pipes are not worth the money.
B002FT5NHY|3|Didn't fit my car.  Description said it was a match but it wasn't.  Not bothering to send back due to the cost of return shipping and then shipping again to get another (that might or might not fit). I drive a Chrysler 200, 2010 year. Ordered a cabin filter at the same time and it fit.
B00LZW6EDE|5|This product is rated as one of the best diesel additives based on independent studies.  It is affordable because a little goes a long way
B00A9WOS7A|5|Works great and was exactly what I needed.
B0016LG0CY|5|I hooked my cb no need of running wires any where.if you need to power some and dont wanna run any wires get this. it works great
B00JA3BMDW|4|It does it's job, but I didn't get the little black deal. Just a battery
B006DX18RC|5|What a difference a new exhaust system made on my 2005 Grand Caravan.  I needed a new catalytic converter, and opted to replace the whole system in one move (especially since I am in New England and the components all rot out from the winter salt).  I added a new rear Oxygen Sensor as well, given the 10 years on the original.<br /><br />I highly recommend having a local shop do the installation, as it is well worth the $$ to have the job done in an hour, and you still come out WAY ahead from having the local muffler shop sell you the material and labor.
B001KSE0Y8|5|Matches the original and easy to install.
B00LEBLI82|5|these are for RV interior light change blubs. these will draw very low power.
B00CODHTCI|5|Love them
B00EC1QUX4|1|Product came  with scratches .not a good fit had to tweak it to fit on my ruckus. But now that it's on it works as expected
B007GFNAEK|5|nice and comfortable, easy to get in and out of and easily adjustable.  Use this in my Jeep when on the trails and it's very easy to get in and out all day, easy to slip on and off, much simpler than a traditional 4 or 5 point with 4 or 5 pieces to put together.  Once set I can put it on easily and I'm secure again.  Padding helps it stay comfortable all weekend.
B001O7PNNM|5|Works great!
B00F55DLTW|5|Exactly what I have been looking for.
B00NHBYOA6|3|I use the cooler for on the job construction, about 3 months now.  Good idea, not thrilled with the perfomance.  I don't think the temperature gets below 50 degrees even running 24/7.  It keeps it cool enough so drinks are not lukewarm.  I guess I had higher expectations.  Feel free to send me an improved version for testing, Wagan.  Haven't used the heated setting, so no comment.
B0000AY50X|5|Goes on and comes off great.  beautiful shine
B000EDUUFS|4|For me and what I needed it for, It's just okay, I cannot fit any of my large knives into this so I'll gift it to someone. The product is fine, the size just isn't good for my particular set. Guess I should have tried to find more information before buying.
B00838808A|5|GOOD ITEM TO PROTECT YOUR WINCH CABLE
B00BP5CZ2U|4|Got this today actually. I was worried it wouldn't fit with my aftermarket 2brothers exhaust, but it did. Very snug too. Definitely a good buy in my opinion.
B0053O9EUA|5|#1 prefered brand.
B00XFS3OU2|5|Got this one because the last one I had from a different company vibrated out. Using the rubberized washer really makes a difference. Not only does it look good, but it's holding up very well too.
B00652G4TS|5|I've only used it a few times with my iPad but this was well worth the money. Current version (7/2015) worked great for me. Helped me diagnose a air bag system code. Gives realtime data and shows any code. Even ones stored in memory my other obdii didn't. I used it on a 2005 and a 2008 gm pickups both diesel. Gave more realtime data gauges on the 2008 model. I'm very pleased with this product and the app worked good as well. It didn't try to charge for anything extra and offered solutions on most of the trouble codes. I'm glad I picked this one.  shipped fast came in a nice box and had it diagnosing my truck in just a few minutes after it arrived. I would definitely buy again
B00F0M1AC0|5|The kit installed quickly on my 2008 ram 1500 4X4 and looks great...
B008G26UBM|5|Makes the 13 year old Trailblazer look new again.
B001DKQ0PK|5|Perfect fit for my 1995 D21 Nissan Hardbody V6.  The CV joints that have exposed metal will rust really quick, so I ended up wiping the oil off and spraying it with black Rustoleum paint.<br /><br />We'll see how long these will last me.
B000WJ64O0|5|Well, my Jeep needed a facelift when it came to the steering wheel.  This did the job.  EXPECT IT TO BE DIFFICULT trying to get it on.  It's tight and needs to fit snug.  I had to have my husband do it and we ended up double teaming it. :)
B00C6REQGO|5|It required a bit of trimming on my BRZ. I'd rather have a little excess material than too little!
B00846HT38|5|I don't really feel as though my reception has been compromised and it really looks good on my MX5. Nice aluminum construction.
B00332GOF2|1|I ordered a set for my 2003 Honda Element. When I tried to install them they did not even come close to fitting, the shape was wrong and they were at least 5 inches too long. The part numbers on the product corresponded to the numbers on the website although I did receive an additional set for the rear windows which I did not order.
B00DX879K0|5|Well worth every dime, and then some!!!
B00FFV10CQ|5|Perfect. Just what I needed, fit great and good price.
B00CS7T0IQ|4|fairly easy to mount. working great,
B004TMHZWG|5|It was what we were looking for with beach theme. Gave as a gift. Very sturdy metal.
B000GRMG2C|1|The cover already is getting holes in it!  I will be returning it as soon as I get a different cover.
B00PYFVWAI|4|(EDIT:  The product I purchased (FH-FBO65115 Classic Khaki Car Seat Covers) is not the product now at this link. Not sure what happened, Amazon!)  Just purchased this set for our latest car, and they're great. Installation is easy in front seats (I did mine start to finish in about 15 minutes, including taking the old ones off); back seats are fiddly, but once they're installed they look fine.  The grey tones very nicely with my 15 Forester.   Do they fit like a custom-cut or OEM cover? Of course not - they're a universal-fit stretch cover, but at this +/- $50 price point  for a full front/back set you aren't going to do any better. I'm baffled by the poor reviews people give this product because it isn't the same quality/materials/fit as the ones costing 5x the price (or more). If you want that kind of custom workmanship, you'll have to pay more; for quick, easy, snug-fitting (in the good way), relatively classic and unobtrusive seat covers to keep your car clean or hide worn/stained upholstery, these are ideal  and excellent value for money.
B00B0C1AYC|5|Very smooth stopping since installing these brake pads and rotors
B00ARVO6HA|5|Great product. Nice rumble when you give her hell and at start up. Improved fuel mileage about 3mpg.
B00A9T28S4|5|Works well. High value for low cost.
B001P2JO54|5|Arrived on time, these clamps put the finishing touch to fuel and oil lines and they come in many sizes.Peter C.
B00V9AUSNY|5|Was a easy install. Parts came early. Was short one nut and washer. But they sent me one super fast so overall it's a great product with great customer service. My truck looks great and still rides like factory.
B0081K3RAQ|5|Fast, undamaged delivery.  Nice &#34;heavy&#34; sticker with clean graphics.
B00F47YV3Q|5|Great kit and really easy to install.  Hardest part is to reach the fog light itself.
B007FHSB20|5|Arrived on time, nice flush fit and finish my second set  love them. Peter C.
B001EOV3JS|5|Fit my friends 2007 Toyota Tacoma like a glove.
B00SBZRR8O|5|I love this product. I transfer gas from five gallon containers to my boat and prior to purchasing the TERAPUMP it was an incredibly difficult experience trying to hold  the gas cans over the intake valve and trying not to spill gas.  This is no longer a problem now that I have the TEAPUMP. No spilled gas.  Very quick and easy. Love the automatic shut off..  Great product.
B0040MI9H0|5|Great cutting pad worked well!
B00KSUA6HY|3|My bulb went out on my fan speed switch and my automatic shifter. These LEDs made a huge difference. Now swapping out all the interior lights with these LEDs.<br /><br />Update: I've had these for three months now and starting to notice the flickering. They work great in the beginning but overtime they start to wear.
B001KQF6OI|5|If you have a Chevy with a 6.5 turbodiesel you need an extra one of theses. It's lasted longer than the 3 factory replacements I've bought.
B008LUVZDW|5|I'm very happy with this product THANK YOU !!
B000KITSMI|5|makes it so much easier to change the core wish I had one a long time ago.
B003ITFAJG|5|Does what it's supposed to Probably increase of 2-4Mpg
B008FCD8DG|5|Fits perfect. Use it more than I thought I would
B009SUJTY6|4|Good gloves.
B00YI3IGA6|4|Fits well on the back windows. Blocks sunlight really well. It covers that triangle gap on sedans that other sunshades can't. Which is perfect for long road trips with my infant. Keeps the sun off the baby. However, it also blocks visibility. Makes checking the blindspot a little tricky. Overall good product and customer service.
B000GU1TJA|5|I've owned three of these covers for various bikes over the past 15 years and they have always served me very well for indoor storage.  I recently added a bike that needed a cover and decided to try the Nelson-Rigg MC904-04 Deluxe All Season cover because it was a few dollars less and Nelson Rigg has a good reputation.<br /><br />Though the quality of the materials was similar to the Dowco Ultra Light covers I had used in the past the Nelson Rigg version did feel a bit cheaper.  It also had metal hooks at the bottom of the cover I was not comfortable with and the XL would not fit a Honda VFR with side bags and a top box where the Dowco XL fits a wider range of bikes.  There are sizing guides on Amazon to help with fitting of these covers but more often than not the indicate no cover will fit most motorcycles so you end up making your best guess using the manufacturers sizing charts.  XL in Dowco fits the VFR with or without luggage very well.  Nelson Rigg XL fit okay with no luggage but would not fit with the side bags and top box.<br /><br />I returned the Nelson Rigg cover, got another trusty Dowco Ultra Light and could not be happier at this price point.
B007ISW28U|5|Love these shocks and a great price!
B0029XK48O|5|Great tool for a mechanic, thank you.
B00DBNF756|5|Gave my 2003 TrailBlazer a fresh new look!!
B000LNUIUI|5|I bought these on sale for a steal. They work great and were a third of the price than at the local stores.
B0022XC1WS|5|I'm CUSTOMER AMAZON<br />EXCELLENT SERVICE AMAZON<br />very good product<br />I RECOMMEND IT
B00KTIUG5C|5|These worked perfectly, were easy to program for my 2001 F-150, and were unbelievably low cost. If I have any durability issues, I will post a follow up.
B000RXKR6M|5|Makes hand-washing your car even better. I use it weekly and it has held up very well so far
B009408LLC|5|I purchased this item for our 1 week vacation.  There was me, two teenagers, and a 5yr old.  This organizer was perfect for everyone!  The morning we left, we placed ice packs in it along with our drinks.  Seated in the back was one teenager with a cell phone, and the 5yr old with a tablet, crayons, paper, and a couple of toys.  The best part, every item had a place for storage, and it was very easy for my 5yr old to get what she needed without having any trouble, or losing anything.  Also, there is a loop on the back that you can insert the seatbelt through so it doesn't slide all over the place.  It's very easy attach or detach.<br />The first part of our journey was 4 hours on the road.  The drinks stayed cold and none of the condensation leaked through.  At the point of our first destination, the temperature was over 100 degrees.  Add to that the car was sitting for about 4 hours while we were enjoying the first part of our vacation.  When we returned to the car, the temperature was overwhelmingly hot, but guess what was still cold?  The drinks in the cooler.  They weren't ice cold as they were before because by that time the ice packs and thawed out, but they were cool enough that we were able to enjoy the drinks on our drive to our next destination.<br /><br />We continued to use the organizer as a cooler in the car for the next couple of days, and I gotta say, with the temperatures over 100 each day, I was really shocked that it worked so well.  And the best part was because every thing had a place, nothing was scattered about in the car.  All you had to do was check a pocket and the item you were looking for was right there.<br /><br />At the second part of our vacation, we went to one of the beaches in South Carolina, again the temperatures were over 100 degrees.  I decided that I was going to see just how good this cooler was.  I filled up the cooler with ice and put our drinks in them.  While we were on the beach, the only shade the cooler has was under an umbrella.  The ice lasted for about 2 hours or more and the drinks remained cold.  Once their was a good amount of melted ice, I checked the cooler for leakage.  There was none.  None of the water leaked out from the melted ice, and there was no condensation build up on the outside as well.<br /><br />On our journey home (which was an 8 hour drive), I decided I would do what I did on the beach and add ice to the cooler instead of using the ice packs.  I really wanted to give this organizer one more final test.  Also keep in mind that the temperature outside stayed between 95-100 degrees up until about 2 hours before we reached home.  I did place a towel underneath...just in case.  About halfway through the trip, half of the ice was melted, but the towel was dry and the outside of the organizer was as well.  Once we reached home, the ice had completely melted and although there was plenty of water in the cooler, that's where it stayed.  The outside was completely dry, and the towel underneath was dry as well.<br /><br />So, all in all, I would very highly recommend this organizer.  Whether you are by yourself, a couple, or family with young kids, teenage kids or both, this is the best organizer to buy and use whether you are going on a 1 hour trip, or a long vacation like we did.  I have this organizer in my car as a permanent fixture since my now 6yr old is always seated in the back.  And my back seat never looked better thanks to this product ;)n umbrella.

B00696Y74O|5|haven't actually used it but it does fit in the fuel tank opening so im sure it will work.
B00TGB9RTO|5|Awesome addition to bike.  Pain in the a$$ to put on, but worth every curse word after you finish
B001JQCCFK|5|Just what I was looking for.
B00S9S8LTC|4|Small good quality I m looking to add remote
B00E4QHN0Q|1|The outer clear, plastic cover bubbles up and looks horrible. Don't buy this one. Get a regular vinyl bumper sticker
B001LQLTPM|3|As other reviews have said, not real eye catching once you get the item on. I expected a little more than what I got.  Basically two stickers on a chrome plate.
B005UGUH4S|5|Works great. Only complaint is that I have to move it every time I take my seat belt off because it blocks the belt from going back into the car. But that's not really anything they can fix. They look great and are comfy. Not super high end quality, but you get what you pay for, and they were worth every penny.
B0031HEIDY|5|works great, fits like it should
B00GDF3I5U|3|Was what I expected for  vinyl decal. Did not fit as stated but was easy to apply and worked fine after some trimming. Seems to be holding up.
B00PAMUACQ|5|Bought these for my husband for Father's day and they are awesome! Very comfortable and look great!
B000EUFRYK|2|Didn't fit correctly, the outside rubber piece was larger then the Airbus would allow.. Corrctly
B00247DI3I|2|Left a high shine that i dont care for but it smells great. Zaino is far supioror to clean with and smells more realistic
B00B8EU45S|5|This spoiler is as advertised.<br />* Excellent Fit, Form & Function<br />* Paint color is an exact OEM match of Vehicle in this case; Nighthawk Black<br />* Simple, clear and easy to follow installation instructions.<br />* Install took 45 Minutes and that included taking time to rust proof the (3) holes that are drilled.<br />Final result is that the spoiler appears as a factory install at 1/2 the cost!<br />Installed 4 weeks ago with no issues. Great deal, no disappointments.
B000GTT88A|5|i am going to order another one for the other 4-wheeler
B009LQ75AW|5|Fast shipping good quality<br />I  install in 5 min
B009LMW96G|5|I think its working. I've treated every couple tank fuls after plugging everything from algea growing in the tank. Also required 2 sets of filters.<br />GREAT LOW SULFUR FUEL is the reason we are all having issues.
B00T9U5408|5|Excellent
B00FX40B16|5|I've used Bosch wiper blades before and always find them dependable. I keep a spare blade in the trunk for when I travel by car, in case a wiper - especially on the driver's side - starts acting funky, as sometimes happen when the wipers get worn from have to deal with a lot of ice and snow.<br /><br />Easy to install and works beautifully.
B00DNEHUEO|2|Numbers are very small and really hard to read
B00BRHM8FA|4|Works well for adjusting tires but most of the other features were useless to me as they are for the newer Gen of jeep Jk not the early jks. But for tires works like a charm.
B00RJND71K|5|Works as advertised and much more economical than the dealer price.
B00D6XLQ92|5|Looks so cool on my car. All my friends are so jealous.
B00WL8X3HQ|5|Holy cow, these are awesome! Was not sure if i would like these, but i really do. They have dot and sae markings on them, so I'm guessing they are approved? Saw some people saying no, But mine have the markings. Instructions are pos. Still have not figured out the halo wires, but it has rained every day, so maybe tonight i can map out how to make em work on my 07 jk.    Edit: so, the instructions I guess are fine, problem was finding an acc for my jeep jk that wasn't the cigarette lighter, or behind the steering column. They also flickered like crazy until i contacted customer support. They are great and fast at getting back to you. Sent me the fix for the flicker. Really love the lights. I get positive comments all the time now.
B001PNIJM2|5|Work great
B00DNJPWSA|5|Nicer than expected. Fit 2002 Kawasaki Mean Streak. Only time will tell on longevity.
B004AGBFH2|5|Fits our ml500, matched with akebono pads, flushed and bled the brakes with Super DOT4. Firmer pedal, seems to stop quicker, and wheels stay cleaner longer....
B0043063JU|5|Very nice, just as described.
B00P30VHSQ|5|This part is a great value! Nothing will fit perfectly like the original part but this handle came close.
B00GBVHPNW|5|Fits a size small I wear mediums but ordered large. And they fit like mediums , very nice gloves fast shipping
B008N202IM|5|Nice sticker to have! A good buy!
B009AJMXI4|4|Loved it and they really make a difference on my car. They look awesome and it's good quality. I also like that it was easy to install.
B00O5MVFZI|5|Great product
B00IRWFQUW|5|Still holding up after a few months. My love has the heart and I have the arrow. Cute idea to buy it and so cheap.
B001EYYRDW|5|Just rigjt.
B00HQYTUYA|5|Bought for my Dad whom had a heart operation and the seatbelt was bothering the area where he has a scar. He is very happy with this product and said it helps a lot.
B0013RLL2U|1|didn't last 2 months-  ripped
B001UFK9NM|5|Larger and more plush towels and I use these for cleaning, etc.  Hold water well, picks up rubbish and dust well, washes easily.  That's what I needed from these towels.
B002K5WXXU|5|This decal is adorable - exactly as depicted in the photo.  Installing it on my vehicle window as easy, and my daughter was thrilled that she can see it every time we get in our vehicle to go somewhere.
B0000AZ7ZI|4|Looks nice in Bayliner
B005CLMRE4|5|Great product ,it is as described thank you
B00936MR1W|4|Good product. Worked really well as a rust cover up on my Dodge Ram truck.
B0089KNGNQ|5|My fiancee lost the key a couple of weeks ago, luckily we had two.  I had set up an appointment at Toyota to replace the lost key, but Sharon did some research and found this key on Amazon for almost $50 less than the dealership was going to charge us.  Then she told me about the chicken dance, which if it worked would save another $110.<br /><br />I was nervous to try it at first because it seemed very detailed yet there were minute variations between the procedures as described by different people.  Also, I wondered if there were any consequences to boffing it.  Anyways, find below, pasted, the procedure that worked for me.  And I did boff it once, in the middle of procedure B, but no big deal, just started from the top and it worked fine.  All told I think it took around five minutes, including the boff and re-do.<br /><br />So, Hurrah! Daytona Toyota, and Hurrah! Sharon!<br /><br />PROCEDURE A<br />This procedure (steps 1. through 5.) is to be used for both the black and chrome logo key fob. This will program the fob to Start/stop engine while it is inserted into the key port. All new fobs should be programmed for this regardless of logo or SKS functionality<br />-------------------<br />1. Get into the car, close and unlock all doors and ensure the car is off<br />2. Insert old fob (your fob that currently works) into slot and remove it 4 times in a row, and insert it a fifth time but leave it in there!<br />2. Open and close driver door 6 times.<br />3. Remove old fob from slot. Car is in fob programming mode at this point. Red anti-theft light remains on.<br />4. Insert new fob and leave in the slot for a full minute. Watch the blinking red anti-theft light on the dashboard. When it stops flashing and goes dark, your new fob is all set.<br />5. Remove the new fob and you're done with the START/STOP portion of programming ( if you have SKS, proceed to PROCEDURE B don't have SKS, proceed to PROCEDURE C).<br /><br />PROCEDURE B<br />This procedure (steps 1. through 10.) is for chrome logo key fobs and vehicles with SKS functionality<br /><br />Lock/unlock doors remotely + SMART KEY functionality<br />--------------------<br />1. Open the driver door and leave it open with no fob in slot (ensure the driver door is unlocked). Other doors can be locked or unlocked, it doesn't matter.<br />Complete step 2 within 5 seconds<br />2. Insert old fob into slot and remove it twice.<br />Complete steps 3. and 4. within 40 seconds of completing step 2.<br /><br />3. Close and open driver door twice.<br />4. Insert and remove old fob once.<br />Complete steps 5., 6., 7. and 8. within 40 seconds of completing step 4.<br />5. Close and open driver door twice again.<br />6. Insert old fob in slot and close door.<br />7. Without pressing the brake, press power button, wait a second, press it again, wait a second, press it a third time to turn car back off.<br />8. Remove old fob from slot. You'll be in &#34;add mode&#34; at this point. Within 3 seconds, the car should lock and unlock doors to verify it is in add mode. (the precise number of times the car locks/unlocks the door is model specific - but it should do it at least once). If it does not cycle the locks, return to step 1. otherwise proceed to step 9.<br /><br />Steps 9.a. and 9.b. should be started within 40 seconds of completing step 8.<br />9a: Press and hold the Lock and Unlock key (simultaneously) on the OLD/MASTER fob. (a couple of seconds should pass and the locks will cycle once. If you do not get this cycle, it is likely due to a weak CR 2032 battery in your fob. Replace the battery in your old fob and try again).<br />9b: Press both the Lock and Unlock key (simultaneously) on the NEW fob. Hold for about 1.5 seconds (several users have reported it being necessary to execute this step twice, if your first go around does not indicate success, try it again and execute this step twice. Please post what worked in the comments below).<br />9c: Within three seconds, press the lockkey on the NEW fob. If successful the lock/unlock will cycle once indicating success (It may take a while for the lock/unlock cycle. I've seen it happen just as I was ready to say, &#34;well, it didn't work&#34;. If you wait for a long time (a long time being more than a minute) and get no cycle at all, complete step 10. and test to see if the SKS functions of your new fob work. If they do, pls report that on this thread).<br />9d. - If you need or want to program another &#34;new&#34; fob, repeat steps 9. a. 9.b. and 9.c. for the next new fob. If done programming fobs, proceed to step 10.<br />10. To end this programming, open then close the driver's door or put the fob in the slot.key on the NEW fob.

B005LDBU0U|1|I've been riding for over thirty years and this is &#34;Not&#34; what I expected. In order for it to work correctly you have to let almost all the air out of it and when it's that flat you don't get any air movement through the mesh which makes for a hot miserable ride. If you put too much air in it - it feels like your riding on a balloon and it just doesn't feel safe.  The reason I bought it was based on all of the positive reviews......my opinion is don't waste your money on it, if you need more cushion you need to change your seat and stay in tune with your ride.
B004C444KM|4|Arived on time. Well put together gloves.
B000J46PTW|5|I love it! It is big but the window is big too. I use it everyday!
B00OX1WIT8|3|This product is great just what I was looking for.
B0041TTVCE|5|Was as described and cheaper than buying one at Walmart
B0029XHOK0|4|It looks great on a tinted window. Instructions make it far harder than it needs to be. Just clean the window, spritz with some liquid, and press on REAL hard with a kitchen mixing spatula or a califorinia water blade of you have one.
B003T0A6KW|4|Everything went together just like it should. Biggest issue was getting the old light out, new fell into place.
B0007TR4CQ|5|just great very light but strong
B007WLWAD0|5|Its exactly what i needed and got it super fast
B000C2G5ZA|3|Product was fine, I just didn't realize that it was a little more paper than rubber
B004LELY6K|5|I returned home from a camping trip and realized I had lost the cover for my fridge vent. This cover is a perfect match for the original cover.
B00M9WUBBA|4|Easy to install, in my helmet anyway, easy to use. Works like it is supposed to. We went on a 4 hour bike ride and these worked well the whole time.<br />Does not work well on an open face helmet. The speakers take up a little room so if your helmet is already tight to your ears than keep that in mind. I had to switch to foam earplugs instead of the reusable ones that stick out a little.
B0010DNA1M|1|This the second one I change in less than a year. Moving to Moog.
B000UE1VCM|5|Good tap, did the job.
B00Q3WWEMG|3|works ok
B009TA59W6|5|They look and fit great. However, the holes where the carpet hooks go is exposed. I plan to fill it with a rubber grommet and use some sealant to keep the water from dripping down there. Normally, this wouldn't be a concern, but if they are anywhere near as good as the Husky Liners I had in the past, water will actually pool up into a puddle during the winter and will for sure drop down into those holes and onto the carpet.
B006XV9GQY|5|It's a K&N, of course it's excellent!
B008G35TB8|2|The assembly fit well and installed easily. However. the outside weather stripping did not adhere to the plastic on the assembly. Also, the weather stripping did not sit on the assembly like the original assembly.
B00RUE0ULI|5|These highway pegs look great. Seem like quality product
B003ZOLCEQ|5|worked perfectly, much cheaper than buying it from the local RV shop.
B003COTFS4|5|Works perfectly on my rzr
B00F3J2FW4|5|Mopar Mats at a fraction of the cost.  Fit perfectly 2015 JKU Sahara
B001GJ3EJS|3|functionable
B0012ZITJQ|4|I received but not tried yet but it looks like it will work out fine..
B003TQ3JQ4|5|It's the only oil that I would use in my 2015 Harley
B002669TU8|5|Works perfectly
B001C066BE|5|Thx
B00X7FE2WW|5|Easy to install. Work well and no more fear of having my hands chopped off by my trunk.
B001FOBPU4|5|Love it!  Very good quality material, vibrant colors!!!  I cant wait to put it on my camper!!!
B004NO3LKA|5|Work well.
B006EGAIII|5|So far so good. Went with these because of the price. Ive used them twice now, first time change the oil on my mothers 2013 Toyota RAV4 . Second time was went i replaced my stock 04 Acura RSX type S rear sway bar. No complaints at all. I thought these things would be a bit difficult to use , but very easy. Just align the wheels well, dont use these on gravel or any kind of crackly/uneven surfaces. Also, when you move your car on, do it patiently carefully and slowly. I will write an update later on in the future once these these things have seen more work. But so far very happy.
B00UZP1HVQ|4|It fits fine. Good seller. Shame after droping 60 K on a new truck Dodge  couldn't include a simple gas cap.
B00JSVRDNO|3|the band is pretty nice and the leather is soft.  the issue that I had was with the watch strap (the small band that holds the watch).  it was NOT NEARLY long enough.  I had to punch extra holes in it to work and that Barely worked.  If you buy this make sure the watch is small.
B00O2AP6L2|1|These ARE not as good a product as bushwackers! They're flimsy, cheap imitations, I'm missing 2 bolts, push pins suck and extremly cheap, they absolutely don't fit gaps everywhere. the rubber seal is jacked from shippment. I ordered bushwackers brand to replace these cheap one's still trying to get my money back for these. Don't waste the time (time spent building them up) or the money, very disappointed.
B00HQU9O90|5|If you're looking for a factory size decal this is the one... I've bought several decals from undergrounddesigns before and they have exceeded my expectations yet again... Very proud to have this on my Jeep. Used to be the lame silver and now gloss white and looks like it was meant to be there. If you're doing this at home here's a tip... Use masking tape to make an outline of the original so you know how to line up the new decal. ( see pic )
B001DBVPY0|5|Looks great easy install.
B004NBJM5G|5|Great replacement for my exterior camper shower that froze. Installed it the day before camping, and it was used extensively as we were camping at a beach.
B007F0RJ3O|5|Great quality and super thing and strong. definitely looks durable in any terrain and if anything spilled, im safe! Definitely recommend buying here than at Toyota! Saved a few more bucks for same great quality!
B002N5W8Q4|4|Works well.
B00CLX3D3U|1|precio alto
B00WJJHDCI|5|Good
B000C1Z2VE|5|quiet and happy, all yay
B00GT2FUB2|5|Backup for my BMW GS motorcycle, works great!
B007SPVKEA|5|Exellente
B00PM5VNAY|4|Works great.  Make sure you read the description carefully if you only have one key.  In that case you are going to have to take it to a locksmith or dealership to get the key programmed.  Try as I might, I couldn't fool the security system with my one key so I had to go to a pro.  The local locksmith here charges $40 to hook up a machine to the vehicle and program the key.  So overall to get another key made for my 2004 Escape, I ended up spending @ $53 but well worth it in the long run.
B00FALVU8A|5|Simply great!  The smell of this product is just fantastic!  It's quite simple to use and work with.  Like the name, it really does go on smooth as butter!  Easy to buff off and leaves a very nice glossy reflective shine!
B000GU5IH4|5|cover is light but protects well and fits my cbr600rr like a glove.
B00W92PA7U|5|Plug and play ! Literally installed and was riding my 1970 Honda ct90 in minutes . Gained about 5 mph also .
B001PYL1VM|5|very nice and simple to work. the only thing about would be that the internal fuse is not removable.
B00VRGM9RI|1|Sucks...I install it correctly and it worked for a second and then turn off....won't even turn on anymore...took me 3 hour for this crap....
B00NJ9MZH0|5|Used on my '03 Club Car gof cart, work great.
B00KTHZR7K|5|Great price.
B00WKS7PPS|2|Not as described. ..way to big had to pay $10 to have it cut down and then had to grind down the edges...my 1989 f-250 is all stock so the mirror's should have fit...not satisfied.
B005JPGTNI|5|Great variety pack of grit sizes.  I use these for plastic models
B00BO9JN4K|4|No problems
B001FNG7BM|5|Great starter for great price,  2002 ford expy eddie Bauer.
B00HTV2E0C|5|Makes oil changes a breeze
B003Y323NC|3|I would like to note I would give the Seller a 5 Star for quick shipping and it was packaged great.<br />The reason I gave it a 3 star is Edge's fault. I bought the Edge CTS Insight to replace a Glow Shift guage that quit working. Although it quit working the Pyrometer and Boost readings were correct before it stopped.<br />The Pyrometer on the Edge is accurate, but the Boost readings are incorrect from 22-24 psi and up. I'm not sure it will even read above 24 psi. Seeing I bought this to be able to monitor my Boost and EGTs for tuning purposes I am not able to log Turbo Boost accurately. There is no mention on their website of it not measuring Boost correctly. I believe the reason is the Boost is measured using the Map sensor which is limited in range.<br />However there is a fix. You can add there Accurate 0-100 psi sensor with their expandable kit which is around $165. The problem with that is if your ordered their non-expandable EGT probe kit(Which I did).<br /> I would have to buy another EGT probe for $125. So I would have to spend another $290 just to get an accurate Boost reading.<br />This is the LAST time I will ever buy an EDGE product as I believe EDGE is out to nickel and dime you on their Products.
B00CCXE77U|5|Very small but cute.
B000M8SY0I|3|One draw back to this package..as you see in the picture it shows what appears to be a hard case for it but what I got instead was a case that was made out some kind of see through plastic much like you would get from a blanket bundle you would buy from wall mart.. The pump works great and I bought this mostly for what appears to be waterproof case for my 4 wheeler but instead got that..other than that everything else is awesome
B00J0ZPAHO|5|LOVE THIS. I CUT THEM OUT AND PUT THEM ON MY CHEVY EMBLEM FOR MY CHEVY CAMARO. JUST ENOUGH PINK THAT ITS LOUD AND CLEAR THAT A WOMAN DRIVES THE CAR. LOVE IT AND GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME. HAS BEEN GOOD IN ALL TYPES OF WEATHER. WOULD BUY AGAIN.
B005H12SZ2|5|Extremely fast shipping  all the way to Alaska thank you they look awesome and work really well these had everything you Ned down to the the atachment wire clips to Mont on the inside door panel looks great on my 2012 denali  hd duramax
B00HXJ8MBK|1|did not fit as described. front set fit somewhat. the back set did not fit at all
B004GCZ4FY|5|Zero issues!
B000CE9OY2|5|Works great sound quality in phenomenal 2003 g35 coupe with bose system.
B000CP2IEO|4|The instructions included in the box were not for the simulators that were sent! It didn't take me long to figure-out how to install them. I placed a phone call to the company and complained about this not for my sake, but for other people. My answer was that I had received the latest version of these simulators (the new ones are over the lug nut mounting, the old style are under the lug nut mounting, hence the &#34;e-clip mounting fixtures go on the front wheels and the lug extensions go on the rear wheels). I am very happy with the simulators as they cover up the ugly white wheels that come stock on these vehicles. No matter how clean you try to keep the wheels, when the tires are rotated to even the wear on the them, the flat surfaces of the wheels (which have rust and are scared from mounting and de-mounting the wheels stick-out like a sore thumb). These solve all of that and make the overall appearance of the truck much better.
B007MUXQVG|5|Did exactly it was supposed to do.
B00HWPYU6Q|1|It fell off while driving
B003X1J79S|5|Excellent product!! Just what was advertised. Fit and finish is perfect.
B00JXI9Q6E|5|It was easy to install just needed a drill because they include the drillbit and the quality is good for the price
B007TY06JA|1|Great price, easy to install, louder than OEM and rattles when door closes (yes everything was installed correctly and secured). Each (passenger and drivers side) lasted 1 tenth of the OEM!!! If you are looking for a repayment part that will last keep looking.
B007RY2BKE|5|Excelent
B00IOUJ72U|5|This head light is truly worth the money.  I have ridden in the dark twice and it is an amazing difference.  If I never ride another mile at night it was worth the money.  That's how much of a difference it makes.  I put this on a 1997 classic.
B010178RTC|5|Looks GREAT....Thank you
B002R4U7G4|5|Used it to wrap the front pipe on my Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 6.  15 feet was more than enough to do the job.
B008MCABKM|5|So far so good, it's holding up strong. Just a little loud with the power of the fans. I would seriously recommend this item. I'm on the road again! Came packed beautifully. Thank you
B001KQAAFS|5|Bought for my mustang and dont have to use my key anymore. Now unlocks/locks with my remote
B00XULVDHK|4|They fit my Passat window just fine and keep out a decent amount of sun. They just cling on and this seems to work fine so far for me- however they do come with suction cups. I have not used the suction cups yet but stuck them on the window for a day to see if there would be any problems and they worked fine.  The company was nice enough to send a card with a quick solution for anyone that gets a suction cup that is not working right away.<br />The customer service is awesome with a personal email asking for your thoughts on your purchase. That right there really makes the company stand out.<br /><br />One thing you may want to think about is you have to remove and fold them up each time you need to roll down the window. Usually not big deal if you are needing a shade but just something to consider. Some like the one that hooks on window better b/c you just release the suction cup and roll the shade up .<br />I like others ,sometimes use it on drivers window to keep the sun off me for long highway drives. Around the neighborhood I usually take t down b/c can be little hard to see cars when trying to turn onto a road etc. . You can see through it but could be little challenging for driver.<br />Overall very happy with my purchase.
B004MDW32E|5|Did the job.
B0091OE6K6|5|This is the best one. I bought one in the store it broke after a few uses. I have this about 6 mos now and it works fine. It came on time easy to put on. I had this brand a long time ago and it last .
B00XD6QHJ6|4|Good for what it is.
B001URQUN8|2|finger holes are too small
B00A4F4ML4|5|Loved this.  Order received on time and item as described.  Recommend to all N. O. Saints fans!
B00KGGTF9U|5|Easy to store and use
B006EH9WUC|5|i love it...as expected
B003EOU0UO|4|Easy to set up off the back of my Jeep's spare and gave us a decent amount of shade on the beach. Held up well in strong breezes. NOTE, the shade is 6' wide at the end of the shade but only about 3' wide where it attaches to the spare, so your shade area becomes much smaller as you get closer to the vehicle. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I still highly recommend this product.
B008CL49P6|5|Awesome! It arrived quickly, and I had it cut and programmed themed day. No problems.
B00JJZ1SLM|5|Worked well. Easy to install.
B00068GEJM|3|It's ok, not as good as Simichrome Polish
B0009V1WSE|3|The reason I rated it only 3 stars was because neither of the 2 latches included fit my hitch properly.  One was too big and did not fit at all.  The other was a bit too small, therefore my bike rack wobbles.
B00D2ZUM3K|4|Great little product! Very lightweight but still sturdy. I have Brutus (I named mine ramses after a German Shepherd dog I had) & paracord monkey fist, and I am extremely satisfied with both.
B00BCRMBGQ|1|These seat covers were a terrible mistake for me to order when I got them they had this terrible odor I had to wash them 2 or 3 times before I could even get it off enough to be able to stand it in my car! After about a week though I just took them off the smell was awful and they just all around are terrible. They come with little hook so you can hook everything (which I didn't no or I wouldn't have bought them in the first place) so after nearly a hour of hooking them they either would come unhooked, fall off, or the hooks would break and then the covers wouldn't stay on. I do not recommend these covers what so ever, don't go for this cheap junk, I wish I would have spent a little extra cash on some in the first place.
B00ERXG4TM|5|works great . adjustable and made from aluminum not hard plastic
B009PAK75E|3|Not a split rear seat. Read all the details completely as it states this fits my car and it does not. The quality and color were great, I was disappointed they didn't fit.
B004ETK0AI|3|its much smaller in person than in the photo...
B00B7M1MAW|5|Fits my 2012 Passat perfectly.  Mats are a bit more slippery than the carpet they replace - takes a bit of getting used to.
B00E0NSL54|1|Let me begin by saying that ordinarily I love Chemical Guys products! This is the only one I've come across that hasn't wowed me.<br />Leaves streaks & doesn't wipe off nicely; microfiber, pressed cloth, paper towels... all a mess. Very disappointed.<br />Needed a good ammonia-free product to use on tinted windows and unfortunately, this wasn't it.
B000EDOSKG|1|Junk..what's the purpose of this if it only pops off every time you put it on? I had it on my sink's lowest pressure and it won't stay on..my wife has to hold it on while I wash the car
B004SEVRZQ|1|inaccurate description of part, don't know what vehicle this fits but its not for the Suzuki Sidekick, mounts for the door and window are completely different then what came out of door. Just irritated that my project got delayed AMAZON very easy to work with and returned was smoother then I thought could be.
B00SSX5ILW|4|Very helpful. It might be nice to have a couple of diagrams to assist in the rebuild (I'm a beginner) but everything arrived in good shape.
B00QMKYYYK|5|Great.
B002H8S80C|5|Nice quality
B00N2LKX2Y|4|It good
B002MF0O5C|5|These headlights were very easy to install with the help of a video I googled. They REALLY updated the look of my 2005 Santa Fe.
B00BFDFQIC|5|Good color match
B00MXTGIY8|4|Cute but broken easy
B004W97JZY|5|My wife loves it thanks...
B0043063JU|5|Arrived on time, is the size we wanted, and the colors match our needs.  We haven't used it yet but it is safely stored in the carrying case.
B00AUX44JK|5|Happy nice magnetic.
B000BQW5LK|5|works great and fits the honda dual pump ii bottles! i wish it can pump more in one shot since i was in an awkward position w/o a lift trying to hold the hose as high as possible into the fill hole. this is to make sure the hose is not tilting up where one may think it's full because fluid might drip back down the hose. but i managed to get it done w/o a lift though a few pumps. you'll probalby have a hard time getting the last 100-200 ml or so but i tossed that into the 2nd bottle.
B00OL134R0|2|it worked 2 times and quit
B00S5O3DIY|5|Easy to use. Excellent.
B00IAZXN2Y|5|Ordered this & in a couple days it arrived. Opened up the box, & literally in 5 minutes it was installed. Love the look! Durable plastic, could probably take a hit by a bird & not break. Haven't had any problems so far with the aftercooler getting HOT? It's still able to suck plenty of airflow, highly recommended by me!
B008G3KG70|5|Fit my 1998 Ford Expedition perfectly.  Easy to install.
B0010GG7YG|5|Absolutely perfect!
B00FAMAFXK|5|Exactly that I need for a very good price.
B00D5O5KYE|5|Great product. Fits my SLK 350 perfectly. It comes with straps and a cable with lock for added security. Also comes with a convenient storage case. If you love your car and don't have the luxury of having a secured storage garage (or for added protection) you need this car cover.
B00C7Y8LGW|5|Works great & alot cheaper! .
B000BZXS5I|5|Warehouse deal was just $12 and they are new. they do rust after the rain, but overall ok
B00UXAC3WK|5|Nice
B008EWPHZE|4|I bought these replacement lights for my son's truck......his were years past due for being replaced. These looked good, and appear to be identical to the ones that came out, but I did have some slight issues getting them installed. As noted by some other reviewers, the holes did not line up properly........in my case it was the outer most hole on both sides. My son has a monster brush guard Ranch Hand type grill protector that would have had to be removed in order to remove the grill assembly so that was not an option.  I chose to remove these lamps from the backing plate as shown in several videos since the lights were only dull from age and not damaged. This allowed the existing backing plate to be used.  The inward most bolt on both lights was exact but the outer most bolt hole must have been a good 1/8\\" out of alignment.  To get mine to work I had to leave the inner most bolt out, have the lamp angled out slightly from the grill, get the \\"bad\\" bolt started and then push the lamp in and get the second bolt in place.  Took some doing and got it in place, but without exercising care it would be easy to crack the light and have to start over.<br /><br />While this was a nuisance it in no way detracts from the fact that these lights are a bargain. At $50 bucks for the pair when dealer was 3 - 4 times that PER LIGHT makes these lights a no brainer.  Even if they only last a few years and eventually crack from stress and need replacing again.........it would still be a good deal.<br /><br />And changing only the lights and not the mounting plate makes this literally a ten minute job for both lights together. Just a few minutes and the truck looks like a different animal.  Now........to get a set of the parking lights and get them changed out...........<br /><br />I would highly recommend these lights if yours are dimmed and yellowed from age. I tried it all.......toothpaste, the fancy rubbing compound lens cleaning kits......all were jokes.  Just spent the $50 bucks and enjoy being able to see with your headlights again.
B00SS3L8AW|5|Really nice, good quality.
B00BLPQ0IE|3|Helmet was fine, but didn't have 10 cent snap for excess strap after it was pulled thru buckle. Very important that excess strap can be secured to not fly around and beat your face or damage your eye. Unforgivable oversight!!............
B00K7935KQ|5|Very lightweight, looks fine with my black bumper.
B00449S5UK|5|Verigood tanks
B0000AY69V|3|soaks up lots of water.  HOwever, it leaves some streaks.  Works in one direction only unlike a chamois. Remids me of the things you see at Fairs that one itme soaks ou a whole bottle of cola.  Only works in one direction.
B00ZPMVKD4|5|I wanted to get some replacement LED bulbs and was tired of spending so much money on one single bulb at the repair shop. These are perfect! These LED replacement light bulbs fit perfectly in my husband's truck and the trailer! I saved myself so much money! These are a high quality bulb, cold white and VERY bright, perfectly manufactured bulbs. I love the fact that there is over 50,000 plus hours lifespan. That is amazing! I received these free in exchange for a honest review and I couldn't be more pleased with this product.
B000O51VJ0|5|Very cool item with all the fire restrictions in California due to the drought this bad boy came to the rescue, safe and easy to set up and put back in the box when done.
B0010E3JW6|5|Fit my 2001 Toyota Highlander with no issues.  Easy and fast replacement.
B00XAX4B9A|4|great
B000BUQOFO|5|These leveled worked great with my motorhome. Lifted the front end up just enough. Was nice not having to look for the right size piece of wood. A definate must for any rv
B00JXZ41RQ|5|received this item as described
B00H9KI9BQ|2|didn't work right for us
B001T2HCQI|5|Installed switch in 2002 Jetta station wagon with 190,000 miles.  Switch functioning properly.  I first tried a cheaper replacement switch that never operated as expected and soon failed completely.  Meyle switch seems to be equal to OEM quality.
B000CFHDNU|5|Much cheaper cheaper than paying parts store prices, fit like it should have and is much more quiet than the old one. Overall, very happy
B00WQ33QL4|2|Product was not cut properly I had to cut it to make it into a proper circle... Ordered it because a friend told me about it... not to happy
B006WQSCNI|5|Works good!
B0014GDGPU|5|Looks awesome on my car!
B00IGIN8L6|1|This product is not of good Quality and is very poor. I don't advise anyone purchasing this product.
B0048A0KP8|5|Great price. Bulbs work great so far.
B00HUW8LWK|5|Nice detail in the graphics, protects the tank well!
B00ZUZXJOO|1|Just bought this battery, ive been turning on my motorcycle every day. Its only been less than 2 weeks and the battery died. I had the bike running, turned it off for like 2 seconds and it wouldnt start back up
B005HR2H0W|4|Works very well .
B004ADYEGO|5|fit well
B000C39C6I|5|Just right would recommend to all
B009IK9RXO|2|It seams to make cars look farther away or it may be me. Does not work for me.
B008D30WCC|1|Serious safety concerns here. These bars are not strong enough to offer protection in a spill. It is very likely they would fold back, trapping the leg or foot causing unnecessary and possibly serious injury to the rider.
B00EJFH6YA|5|This is a great light bar with a lot of light output. I mounted mine on top of my tractor ROPS facing forward. I get a really good spread of light from left to right and front to back for loader work.
B00KLPVXXW|4|It was missing one wheel. Other then that it was cute. They did refund my money.
B00AOO73ES|5|great, strong, easy to assemble.
B00D3298A0|3|Good quality, but heavy smell
B0067UG5L0|1|Perfect fit on my 2002 Lexus ES300 and at 1/10th the cost of other options<br /><br />Update... failed a year after install. Bushing is completely torn, rattles, worse than the one I took out a year ago.
B007NQMNUY|5|Perfect!
B000C7QHNU|5|works perfect
B00GSHLSQ4|5|excellent product
B007O5GXSW|5|it went in very quick seems to be working good and it was shipped very fast
B00ZVJ32QE|1|This looks nice and it said it would fit my cr-v. The instructions made absolutely no sense for my car, showing hooks that dont exist. The front seat covers tore by the velcro strap for the arm rest. Thr velcro itself gets caught in the armrest which is sn idiotic design. Best part is the backseat covers didnt fit at all.<br /><br />Keep your cheap universal crap for walmart.!
B00PP6ORAS|5|Recently decided to order these for my Camaro. They look great, easy peel off and stick on application, they've lasted through several thunder storms and rain showers. No problem with these yet. Would recommend. And they came really quickly.
B005UQQARG|1|cheap looking
B001GC2LVM|5|Just as expected
B000LNWUPE|5|Valspar implement paint is the very best paint that you can buy. I am using the paint on my 68 Firebird parts,and I have no better paint anywhere. So if you want a durable,and long lasting finish use Valspar implement paint.
B000KOKJTS|5|perfect
B002CN0GFM|5|Just like the ones Ford put it!  And it comes with a light bulb!
B00J7ETU8S|5|Love it in every way!!
B005J1UADM|5|My car is driving a lot better
B0083WWXEI|5|I bought my car in a State that requires front plates but it's registered in a State that does not.  I don't like plates in the front but if your car has the mount you have to do something.  I looked into plugging the holes but didn't like others that I saw.  So a front plate was what I needed for my new Infiniti Q60 convertible!!  (Can you believe the dealership didn't have any in stock??)  This was quick and a good price.  Beautiful plate.  Infiniti logo sticks out (3D) as well as the letters of INFINITI.  Dealership did throw in a stainless steel frame which matches this plate.  Looks pretty good!!
B0037UVQEE|5|We installed it a month ago & it works great so far.
B007NNJGQQ|5|Great fast shipping. Put this on my wr400f for onroad use and works great super easy to install took me about 20 minutes to hook up. All the features are easy to use.
B0000AY3X0|5|love this for cleaning my stamps when I craft - very absorbent and nice to the touch
B00UAR11ME|5|Gave my Dyson new life.  Works just like new again!
B00LFL8MJO|5|For the price you can't go wrong. You will need to press the bearing to the hub, use the new retaining ring then press the shaft to the bearing.  I used harbor freight bearing press it was easy.
B000CQPUAC|5|Perfect fit for my 2006 Dodge ram 1500 quad cab.
B003T7XUE4|2|after getting it decided not to use it, slow drain times and requires complete removal to get the last of the used oil out of the duramax pan
B000PLV8TG|5|I broke this when I was replacing the carb (see my other review) and this was a perfect replacement.
B000C59NC4|5|Easy to install, shipping was very quick and very good quality product!!
B00027H0WM|5|Perfect fit. Very impressed when I got her in the lake.
B000CMJ0Q6|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B000C808SE|5|Bought this cap to go on a Isuzu Rodeo 3.2 V6 radiator.  Works great to keep the coolant where it supposed to be.  The cap I was replacing was a bit too tall and the hood of the car was pressing against the old one that I mistakenly purchased.  This is a low cap and works great.  I don't have to worry about it because it isn't being 'pressured' by the hood of the car.
B000HTNPLU|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B000CEO7GM|5|Worked well
B000IYQFW0|5|It fit perfect, been working with truck for a week and a/c works great.
B00JXNK1Z4|1|Kinda cheep
B00NFA8MQG|1|Worst product I've had lights flickered and poor connectors. Ballast burnt up 2nd day of having them
B003VLBPJA|4|Works fine
B000CRGV54|1|This item does not fit the 1973 Cougar XR-7 351 Cleveland motor as advertised. The company contends that their information shows it is the correct part but we have the original motor mounts currently on the car & top holes are too wide to mount to the engine. Also width is too wide for the saddle.
B00TEFJLZ2|5|very good item
B00MOKMTLW|4|Installed in 1 hour start to finish by myself. Use a 16mm socket and wrench. Emergency brake line gets in the way of rear driver bracket install, but it is no problem to work around. Many pictures in the install guide are flipped the wrong way but they get the point across well enough. Packaging is top notch. Kind of an awkward bar length - long enough that it kind of should have a middle support, but short enough that it doesn't. Overall considering the price, this is an excellent buy with straightforward install.
B00TR7WYB0|5|Great looking
B010RTGIQI|5|Work great
B000TQ6P40|4|Tool worked as supposed to, but is a little flimsy.  I would not expect tool to last if used on a regular basis. Good value for a shade tree mechanic.
B00KQXYSR2|2|This comes as described in the commentary but not as depicted in the picture.  The picture depicts the smaller box as being similar to the larger with adivider.  However, there is no divider, it is insulated, a drawstring and handles.  It's my fault for not reading but I am ticked that the picture depicts something very different and the small box as depicted was a major selling point for the reason we wanted it.
B00KTHZJ1O|5|As desribed and works well so far
B002LF7CI0|5|Fit great and looks super
B00IEYDZTC|5|Arrived quick and item is what I expected.
B00CPYAPFO|5|Thought is was too cheap too be good .But it was quality parts.
B002UNAUVO|4|2000 jeep Cherokee classic 4.0l<br />Fit perfectly, securing screw is much bulkier than the factory and I don't expect it to ever break, no leaking from sides or screw head,<br />Easy installation<br />4 starts because I have no way of testing if it actually functions well... I'm in a very warm climate<br />Only reason I needed this piece is because my factory block heater fell off. The securing screw was a thin piece of metal that was bent into place when screwed down... Terrible engineering, corroded and snapped in half<br /><br />Happy with it, if you need it buy it,
B004180TDA|5|Worked excellent on the bottom of the side skirts on my '06 chevy malibu maxx.
B00G2T6O30|4|Product is very good as described. It stays firm and looks good.
B009VI5TDU|5|Good complete kit. Works exactly as expected.
B00H7LPKKU|5|Coupler works great, makes the job clean and easy!
B001AMCAAA|5|These all are great.
B002XOXSI2|4|This buffer works very well.  I would rate it higher except  that the metric fasteners were too short to attach the handle.  I called Meguiar's and the mailed me two screws the same as I had.  I installed longer screws and all is well.  If I recall the screws were about 15 mm long and needed to be 20 mm.
B000M5NNQ6|5|After spending extra money for a fuel additive, my mpg's went up significantly. Now I save $5 per tank even accounting for the cost of this stuff. Truck runs smoother too.
B000IVPYHA|5|Seem to be as good as the orig. cables
B00TPV6EUK|3|I had the chance to try this windshield out and I found that it was too short for the ATV that I installed it on. There was about a foot of space between the top and bottom that was not covered and it was a little too long on both sides. That being said, the material and construction is good for the price. If the dimensions of this match your ride then I recommend it, but it is not as universal as it seems, in my case it didn't fit.
B000N9MQNW|1|doesn't not work properly the o-ring seal leaks and the fitting didn&#34;t match my 75 hp 1982 evinrude i have to replace with factory fuel pump
B002ZBPXGS|5|Looks great when done especially vinyl dash
B00BGEO7DK|5|good quality item.  arrived quickly
B0073MNC5S|1|Do not buy this.  It is a piece of junk.  It worked for a while and then suddenly fell apart, dumping my keys in the process.  Thankfully, it was in my pocket when it happened, or I would have lost a bunch of keys.  This is a piece of trash.
B00G6KGPFM|5|This product is easy to apply, levels and seals very well. I have had very good results. You must clean the surface where applied with mineral spirits. A must!!!!!
B0016NBBQW|1|samething doesnt  work but to tired to take back off. check eng light still on code reader says its not working guess it was bad as well
B00074QUDU|5|The product was the exact replacement and works as it should. Very pleased.
B007VRELY6|5|Excellent product, it works perfectly.
B004ZOCEFG|5|nice jacket heavy....
B00AN79HNQ|2|Looks nice, but the silver end pieces unscrew easily, I've lost them all after just a couple weeks of light use. Cycled through the pieces on he spare cord too, so I can't use it anymore.
B004QC8A82|4|The unit had a defective control box in it.  It wouldn't draw up the boat on the trailer without cutting in-out in-out every half second.  I called Trac and they were very helpful in troubleshooting and sending out the new control box.  It's working fine now.
B00EMLYQYY|5|Not as heavy as I thought, but very good quality.
B00192MU2Y|5|I bought this to convert my original RV cord to an extension cord since, the end was what went bad.  It was easy to do and the product seems durable.
B000I04Z7Q|5|when I got these I was so exited to set them up I jumped right into it... 2 hours later, they are set up and just need to get a power source. Doesn't come with anything to hook them up to so I had to go to Walmart and get a $3 cigarette lighter adapter. So here is the conclusion<br />PROS:<br />Very Bright at Night - not to bright and not to dim<br />A lot of Modes - 7+ modes make it so customizable<br />Music Mode - flashes to music<br />CONS:<br />For $35 I shouldn't complain but the music mode is of about .5 seconds when the bass hits the lights flash faster and it's just a bit off, but I can deal with it (:
B001LHVOVK|5|works as advertised. Not full of features, but reads the codes as needed. Excellent value for the price.
B001J7CO02|5|Loud and big. Had to rearrange the horns to fit, and purchase a few more things, but definitely worth it. Putting a piece of plexi glass to shield from mud and rocks. We'll see how it holds up. Mounted underneath bed, will most likely put a piece of plexiglass to protect from rocks and mud
B00GBBCUNC|5|Delivered as promised. Fit perfect for our 2013 Sienna XLE
B002P8KPL4|5|Great and arrived quickly
B004QMBHQ4|2|I ordered it after reading good reviews but returned it. Could be lighter, and it pressured my head at some spots. Ended up buying a slightly more expensive shoei helmet and I am very happy with it.
B00PXZ919I|5|What a great product!! After not being completely satisfied with the outcome of my work using a PC 7424 I decided to so a little research and look into the newer DO, let me tell you that I took the plunge and bought this piece of equipment and I couldn't be happier. Not only does it not vibrate at all as opposed to my 7424 but it distributes product a lot more efficiently. It makes working on vehicles at least 33% faster with much better results and with almost half the product used. I'm not sure if my PC was on its way out, but at speed six it would vibrate too much scattering product all over the place. I redid some areas where the PC was unable to correct scratches and the Torq cleared them very easily with minimal product remaning on the pad. Not only that but it's also a lot quieter which makes the job that more enjoyable. For the price I don't think the Torq can be beat!! Highly recommend!!
B001DCEX6G|5|Fits great and on Amazon at a great price.
B00FS84PHS|5|I am not using this strobe in the typical way these were manufactured for (these were manufactured for semi trucks and trailers).<br /><br />I plan to use it with my car alarm to give off a strobe if the alarm detects an intrusion.  Varad sells an equivalent strobe (for car alarms) but that unit draws a lot more current than this one.  And this Maxxima unit has much better construction than the Varad counter part.  Besides, the Varad unit didn't see much sells as you can barely find information on the internet.
B005QZJQRC|5|We have an 08 armada with air ride. Like so many of the armadas the air lines leak. I tried to repair them with no luck. So I removed the air ride springs and replaced them with these. It rides great now. The only other thing you need is new shocks for a non air ride truck.
B000QRTF4Y|5|Great fun game in excellent condition. Happy with purchase.
B0055FFMGM|5|Good price, would buy from seller again.
B002EBQX72|5|It's an oil filter.
B0040CWUY8|4|Not the best quality but they do the job
B000AS3D3S|5|Love Motocraft filters! I have always used FRAM oil filters and some others that were well over $10 a piece and they all worked pretty much the same....fair.  The Motocraft filter was noticeably heavy when I removed it because it was full of contaminants which it removed from the oil while filtering! The oil was practically crystal clear in the drain pan which has NEVER happened with any other filter. I am so impressed and will NEVER use any other filter! Can't believe how well this filters and the price is arguably the best!
B005UK33F4|5|NIce item works as it should so far.  I havent used it but a few times and so far so good.  It was shipped fast and packed well.
B00SQXGRJQ|1|The product looks good but does not fit a standard garden hose bib. It comes with no instructions and parts that one is not sure of where they go. I will be returning this product shortly!!!
B0034LRETW|5|Good quality, came with mounting clips but not emblem.
B003OAES8I|4|Gave headlights a nice look. I have a white jeep and I like the black and white contrast.
B00BFDHBYY|5|exact replacement, works fine
B00EJON5Z0|5|This product is very nice. Made with real leather and appears to be very durable. I would recommend this product.
B00062YBSO|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B007VX4DMA|5|Signal performance did a great job with this package. Fast shipping, got the tank in separate box at same delivery as all the other parts. Everything as listed!
B00U6NUNL2|5|great product
B003CG9PIC|5|Great product, Thank you.
B009K4H42Y|5|Does NOT come with the crush washer. If your Honda model requires replacing the crush washer every oil change, you will need to source these separately.
B000CQQKGU|5|Does what its supposed to do
B003IOKPLO|5|Worked great on my codes. Screen display and clear function.
B00E3OM7L4|5|great product and service,
B00NLJ02ZA|4|A tad small for my 2015 highlander. It does its job just wish it was a little longer in height.
B000BOKN8Y|4|worked
B00VNBDWPK|5|Very good quality better than others I've bought. Comes with all the nessary plugs for reversing polarity and ones with resistors to correct error lights. The bulbs give off a nice light that is more useful and less blotchy than other led bulbs. Very happy with my purchase.
B007HRHZ7U|5|Good product
B004JBXJEK|3|Faded quickly
B000SKYL9I|5|Its oil, works as expected
B004GDSS6U|5|Perfect fit
B000NOUQRA|5|small, perfect, sturdy and easy to use. THANK YOU.
B00C0YQXYQ|5|Item as described & worked perfectly. All fittings are quality brass & the gauge is liquid filled. The item was shipped extremely fast & packaged well.<br />Highly recommend product & seller.
B005N6XHAG|5|Nice looking shirt, as described
B00R6RQ5PY|3|Is this for the right side mirror
B00BTL7GI8|5|very good part
B002R0R3D8|1|Had to order two of these. The first one had a leak that was impossible to find. The second one was water tight.
B002C7DSIK|5|Works great in my 2005 Chevy Impala!
B00199BO4C|5|Works like it should.
B003KU68MQ|2|Quality of the connectors were pretty poor. Had to bend a few to get them to fit into distributor cap. Would not recomend.
B004M0D04C|5|Exactly what I wanted these dice are huge
B00JT5310S|3|So far so good but I'm concerned that it may fall of if I hit a pothole. The original caps have a wire ring that keeps the cap tightly in place. These did not have them nor did they have the grooves to accept a ring
B009FU6TP6|5|Great shocks, have these on a 06' Silverado and a worlds of difference. Even better when on dirt roads, no complaints.
B00TK1G374|2|The package come with three big light and 4 small to dodge journey 2013 required six big light and two small light disappointments
B003EOZLEO|5|Sturdy, looks great and very easy to install.  I was a little apprehensive give the past issues with the passenger side fit, but I am happy to report as others have that the issue has been fixed.  The most difficult part was removing the factory side steps.  All total takes maybe 30 min with the right tools and install instructions aren't even needed.
B003BHR0MK|1|It wasn't the right one for my vehicle
B00K87WD8C|1|Bolts that came with the intake were too long. After less than 5 hours of noncontinuous riding the rubber seal has come loose from the metal causing an air leak which inturn causes my four wheeler to backfire and not run right. Definitely would not buy again.
B009PC9PMS|5|Looks amazing on my 96 Kawasaki 1500 classic. My girlfriend ordered this for me as a gift...easy to install had no issues what so ever, rides great. I am extremely satisfied with this product...I'll have to kiss her twice for this awesome gift
B00DCF251C|5|Love these gloves. A little expensive but you get what you pay for. Very comfortable and durable so far. Only 4000 miles on them so far, many to go.
B006UKN5LA|5|Very good Product ¡¡
B007TY2G9I|5|Great product, fit my 1999 Toyota Corolla perfectly
B00FBKJ2BW|5|Perfect.  Thx
B00AIFZ2Q4|5|Was perfect for the job I needed to do. Made a great wire for my woofers as well. Also it was very flexible.
B0027G2U0I|5|great and light
B00E1L72RS|5|6 buck ...AWESOME!
B00PJPHEBO|5|Works great! Takes a while to figure out the pairing.<br /><br />Make sure you BUY Torque Pro. It's an essential tool for Android O/S.<br /><br />It can help you know when your car is ready to be smogged by viewing the &#34;Emissions Readiness s/DTC&#34;
B00HHIWTCU|4|Needed a little reinforcement, but overall works great!
B00HTV2EMA|5|Makes oil changes a breeze
B001JT98HM|5|I know that title sounds odd, but neither my husband nor I smoke. However, my MIL does. I bought this ashtray for her to use outside when she smokes. I know it's made for cars, but I liked the size of it and figured she could use the handle to hook it on our deck railing. A friend who also has the same situation with her MIL had recommended a self extinguishing ashtray since it helps with the odor. She never did that but did like holding it when she smoked. It captured the stench for the butts much better than our regular ashtray did and I didn't have to worry about the them not being put out properly, which had been an issue in the past, or the kids or dog getting into it.
B00AAGDEB6|5|Makes your bike look brand new
B000COBLKW|5|Great value
B00374OASE|5|Great gift for your money
B007V2CCNI|4|I love this thing. It fits and covers my whole front window. It really makes the van cooler on these 100+ degree days. It also appears to be well made. The only thing I don't like is that it's big and bulky and takes up too much room. There's really not a convenient place to store it inside my van.
B0071FS90U|5|Excellent product and it works for my road bike too.
B005ASY23I|5|works great so far only time will tell how it does in the long term but looks like it will last. build quality was really good for the price.
B007L97AAQ|5|Perfect fit.
B00BLPW8R6|2|The bracket (which is different than the image shown) worked well for the first 9 months. A small light is provided, as is required by law in many states. The plastic snapped in half (possibly mid-ride) after 9 months for unknown reason (bike is in a garage when parked, weather is mild so should not be an issue). I would recommend getting a metal license bracket for a more long term solution.
B00DX8CDYM|2|Not as describe
B0028CJGAI|5|Quick shipper...good product
B001P2BYXY|5|These are the best by far, they protect your floors and keep the carpet dry, they don't leak, heavy and sturdy especially in our climate with lot of snowy boots that get full of sand and salt. And they come in and out easily to drain off the melt or to wash them. Well worth the price, we keep our vehicles a long time, had them before for the other truck and have yet to wear them out.
B000BVRZ74|5|Incredible!!! I was shocked how well this makes the rain &#34;bead&#34; on the windshield. I was about to change wiper blades but after applying this, I was able to wait another several weeks before replacing.
B000C2SQOS|5|A much better design than the oem
B008G32VGO|5|It was just like the oem ones but for half the cost and no loss in quality. Awesome deal!
B001G8FXJS|5|I bought this to charge an electric bike and an electric wheelchair, and it is working perfectly, some 4 months or so later.  It has two LED indicators, so I know when it's charging and when it's done.
B004YWPELA|5|ok
B00O7ZX19G|5|Nice vinyl decal. I put it on the back window of my 4 runner a month ago and it hasn't come off even though I regularly roll the window up and down.
B004UR1B7K|3|its to heavy to transport
B00598SLI6|5|she loves it.
B004O80QP8|5|great product
B004INAQN6|4|Very nice looking, and they work.
B0002SR4Q8|1|Absolutely does not work at all, no grip, not deep enough to reach, etc. Waste of money.
B004GCRB9G|5|Worked great, my wife actually installed it herself with a U tube video as assistance
B00151AAB2|3|This belt has issue between the photo and description. The photos make it look smooth, but it has a serrated interior loop. Just make sure you get what you think you're getting
B000IYT158|5|works great!!!
B00PG2QA1K|3|This product is okay a little side table that's inexpensive, however the dimensions said the height was 21&#34;.  I found this to be incorrect.  The actual height is about 15 1/2 &#34; when in use.  When the table is folded up the height is 21&#34;.  Other than the misconception of the height the table is just fine for light use.
B000A8J97C|5|They fit great, easy to install!
B0074FQKDA|4|It works.
B00CIMAXEG|5|Nice part installs perfect fit etc
B00DW0I1HE|3|Received my order very fast--glad because it is a gift for my grandson.  However, when I opened it, something had leaked all over and I had to wash everything off.  The tire cleaner is NOTICEABLY lighter than the quick wax, and they are both supposed to be 16 oz.  Disappointed, especially since this is a gift.
B002IV8I80|5|Very nice spare tire holder for the money - also ingenious.  Used on a Kendon fold-up motorcycle trailer (attached to front tongue).  Attached very nicely - put padlock through top to secure - works like a charm.  Had some concerns about the simplicity of this unit - but really like how it works and find the simplicity a real positive in this case.  Seems sturdy.
B009DK0NIM|5|Super easy to install, spruced up my 2001 Camry for it's 200,000 mile birthday;<br /><br />She's smiling pretty now =) Just two screws to uninstal/reinstal<br /><br />Fit like a glove
B001COB2DC|5|Cleared up my check engine light.  Easy enough to put into my 2003 c230
B0034Y2V3I|5|Its an oil filter, works as expected
B005NLQAHS|5|I love this thing.  It does so much more than auto store scanners that cost quite a bit more!
B0051SO7JQ|1|The first time I used it, almost exactly 42 hours after beginning the initial charge (minimum of 40 hours per the instructions) the inverter fried. Haven't tried the other outputs as my tires and battery on my auto are working fine. I would not recommend purchasing this item and it will costs too much to send it to the Return Merchandise Center.
B00099DW6G|5|Love it I get lots of troling hours on one charge
B000EEU0IO|4|I've always dreaded the day I become that middle-aged guy who has a bead cover on his seat - I've never even understood what they do, just that they look ridiculous.<br /><br />Well, now I have a 70 minute commute, and even though my AC works great, the seats are fabric, and I can easily work up a sweat on my back and butt, so I relented.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about the beads is that they dont feel like beads when I sit on it, it feels like a more or less even surface, not bumpy. It raises me off and forward on the seat a bit, so the seat needed some adjusting, but I can't argue with the fact that it solves the back sweat issue.<br /><br />As for massage or back pain effects, I really didn't suffer from that, so I don't have any opinion of its effectiveness there.
B00K6DLP7I|2|its a pretty cheap switch. shipping is slow.
B005MZXZ3C|1|I ordered this one or so I thought but did not get it
B008KWNCOQ|5|OEM Replacement works as should
B00LTH42HU|5|Love these little guy's they make taking off and putting on my motorcycle helmets easy and quick. Thanks
B000QV0JQ8|5|Good item
B00JPJYCII|5|Good quality and best price around.  These have the standard ratios needed to mix most paints. They are a simple way to premix your paint prior to application. They are even useful afterwards to hold things. You may consider the smaller size also for small jobs.
B0000AXCSP|3|Works well But you must have a bed liner so That the tarp can slide. Could not crank out mulch on the bed alone.
B009OBW29S|5|This was is very easy to put on, smells like cologne (not offensive), but great, but you will need a couple of towels to remove.  I have a VW GTI and let the wax dry for 40 minutes and it still requires a lot of effort to remove. 3 towels would remove the residue completely.  Not complaining, it just shows that the product stays on the car very well but requires much effort to buff off.  It really does get rid of the swirls and light stone chips from the hood of the car.  Would definitely purchase again!
B007T7TPE4|5|Excellent working well
B001ULS4KG|5|Work great
B00TFZO8UY|4|They fit very well and i am now able to leave the windows slightly open without having to worry about a wet seat after it has rained. Provides good air circulation when the car is parked for extended periods.
B00BFE0P6E|5|Fits perfect!
B00029XD62|5|Used this on some straight window trim. Looks great and has held up to washes and rain for a month so far.
B00NO4JH9Y|5|Couldn't be better. Great price and fast delivery. Awesome!
B0011FJXOM|5|Good product. Exactly what I needed.
B005JIQJYE|5|Super easy installation except for starting the screw into the pillar. Also the Distance Since Last Regen doesn't display due to Last FCA update but eventually they said they would get a new version release to fix the issue
B0058FETMM|3|chrome has some rust spots after a few months. Go with the painted version
B0093XLGVM|1|Missing SMD on one bulb.  Neither bulb worked.  Resister burnt on both bulbs when I plugged them in.  Being kinda a techie type, I disassembled them to look.  Both bulbs had a resister meant for a 6volt system instead of a 12 volt system.  The internal wiring was backwards on one of the bulbs, the other bulb didn't even have one of the connectors soldered.  Basically these bulbs are a writhing mass of nasal sludge and should be pulled from Amazon altogether, as they destroy the quality perception of the brand.
B00JXM47SC|5|Absolutely exactly what I wanted.  They look amazing. Just need to clean my rims REALLY well now lol
B002HVKJU6|3|I like it.  Easy to install and works fine. UPDATE: came off the post several times. Retainer tab is not a good design. Had to make a retainer that connects with a screw to make it work. Required drilling and tapping the mount and then making a new retainer for a custom fit. Original design isn't good.
B0000AZ7WJ|3|Looks to be average quality lock. The diameter is actually 9/32 and not 1/4.
B001A6T9OQ|5|Great
B001DKQXXO|1|This bulb didn't fit my car as stated .
B00JL803RC|5|Fast shipping. Fit and look great. Easy to install.
B00P9HE05U|5|Handy, handy, handy for camping!
B000C5WCUE|5|Nice
B008G3BBCO|5|These look great and fit and work better than the original mirrors.Half the price of local parts stores.Put them on my 94 Dodge ram 2500.
B00I1KMLSK|4|Easy to charge; Easy to install.  Fits my Jetski perfectly.  I would have given a 5-star rating had all the acid containers emptied properly, but it did not take much effort to complete the acid fill.
B000GTMIYG|5|A must have tool for a body man! This is a quality USA made product and the shipping was very fast!
B00HZB4R1A|1|Total scam, should have read better.  I think that's the idea.  Hopefully you won't read that your getting a sticker that looks like a paw print.
B004NMWSS8|5|Thx
B000P70R1U|5|Just as pictured, a quality product.
B0012APN3Q|5|Good product
B000BZ93HK|5|Fast shipping and arrived as promise! Thank You!
B004EIDD2Q|5|I bought this when we ran outta juice at Walmart and there was no way to put the car in neutral to roll it back to be jumpstarted (hybrid). It cranked over a dead battery and the 4cyl fired up. Well I figured it wouldn't hurt to move my v6 explorer today and grabbed the pack just in case. No chime or lights when I opened the door so the battery was completely drained. It turned the ford over and started the engine. Super impressed so far with it. I know it isn't a do all pack but it works on v6 engines and 4cyl for sure.
B0027XEGOO|5|Great invention.  Makes operating the fan in the RV easy and quick without needing a stepstool.
B0014TQLP4|5|Great Look
B00WUN5492|1|If I could give this 0 stars I would. It was ordered as a birthday present for my nephew, and he used it for about .0007 seconds and it quit working. The buttons don't work, the songs might randomly start to play and then good luck trying to stop them again. You can't navigate the menu at all either.<br /><br />It also cannot be returned because it was ordered in advance so by the time he opened it the return policy had expired. Don't waste your money on this pile of junk!
B00OVBTKKU|4|They work, but I doubt they are 800 lumens, seriously doubt, like no way in hades doubt. But what the heck, they work ok.
B007JMOY22|4|Great sturdy mount for the money, bought it for my steel floor trailer. The holes were perfect for the Smittybuilt winch. Finish was nice and thick, I bolted and welded it down. The less than perfect reviews are only because it was not specific for the application, this is a universal mount great for a flat surface on a bumper or trailer bed. I usually make my own but for the price this is cheap and easy. The mounting hardware is decent but expect to buy better, that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. I would not hesitate to buy it again.
B00D9C2CDO|5|12 hours in some heavy rain, Florida to Texas in the heat of the summer, did GREAT!
B00NY7JM64|5|I read the reviews before purchasing this, and I was kinda nervous due to the mixed reviews. But mine came really nice and good quality... The gold chain and key ring was nice and shiny...
B00BFXJGAQ|5|Bought this for my buddies 2007 ZX6R. His turn signals were flashing like crazy decided to give this a go and bam! 2 second install and the signals started to work like normal!! Thanks
B00IAGN4UY|5|Spark plugs. Good quality.
B00QSNZJGI|5|Great product and can't be beat for the price. Look exactly like the picture and even arrived a day earlier than expected. Pins screw in and out with no issues.
B010NA8MT2|5|great price
B005K7W5HE|5|Bought this to lock the spare on my truck. Works great and I don't need an extra key.
B0040HCK8O|5|I use these professionally, full time in a shop on a daily basis and they work great. Realistically, they should be used in combination with a torque wrench any way, but they will get you fairly close to how tight you need a vehicle's lug nuts to be. I've used them on every car I've taken wheels off of over the past 1 1/2 years, and they still are holding up great. They aren't magic and don't expect them to be dead on accurate (even high end one's from snap on and matco aren't). They are more of a safe guard to keep you from over torquing a nut or bold when using an impact gun, and for that reason they are immensely valuable.
B00E8TAEZU|5|Great guages and very reasonable
B00COTMMOC|2|I have had this cover on my 2015 GMC Denali for over eight months now and it definitely has some issues. When folding twice if you're not careful in the spring holders come out of the track then will put a dent in the first section closest to the cab. The track that the spring holders are supposed to stay in must be too wide. I have attached a picture and it's hard to see but I probably have six marks on each side where the spring holder has dented that first section. Not real pleased.
B00B71M9V4|5|Great decal to throw on our new Subaru! Showed up quickly and looks pretty cool on our Outback.
B004W96UFE|1|Crappy fit and finish. Broken in the shipping process. I am highly disappointed
B00T68UETE|5|Great product. Works as advertised. Thanks
B000VEMIB4|5|Great product! Fits great and looks amazing. The seller shipped it amazingly fast and I am so happy with my order.
B004RDVU3C|5|Perfect all around
B00VB2OE9O|5|Cover fit car perfectly. First rate seller and fast delivery.
B00W8LR17Y|4|The window vents fit good, the fronts on both sides fitted kinda tight but worked out well plus made the car look nicer.
B004RCSKB8|4|Beware - if you are a do-it-yourselfer like me, you need a router to spin-weld the fittings onto this tank.  I don't have a router and took this down to the local RV shop to have the fittings spin-welded, and the cost was nearly as much as the tank!<br /><br />Like may products sold on Amazon, this one is lacking many of the details and photos you would expect from responsible retailers, and one of the details not mentioned in the ad, but which shows up on the manufacturer's web site is that if the tank is larger than (I think it was 35 gal) you need to build a frame around the tank to support it.
B00495UQT2|5|Worked like a charm in my LR3. Put on steel bumpers and used this instead of factory washer bottle.
B000EDST1U|3|Too thin for the price paid. This looks like it will end up bending and scratching up pretty soon.
B0002UNON8|3|Unfortunately, it did not do much for scratches, but it certainly helped restore my headlights as they look good as new!
B00NTOJU28|5|Beautifully bright. Their add is right. I bought the cheap ones and they are not anything near to these in brightness. In my 03 BMW. Put one in the trunk and one near the rearview mirror. Changed the whole look of the car. I also used the 1.5&#34; in my doors.
9830032795|4|High Quality, I really liked it, but the only issue with it was that the colors do not match the picture above. The mustang side is more of a purple and the ford side is more of a neon pink. They do not match together but other than that it was a overall good product!
B00TACQD0U|5|Well made, I have not installed mine just yet but during mock up they appear to be fine. I might use screws instead of the rivets but I'll decide that later. Appears to be a good product and the price was good as well. Quick shipping too. I will probably buy another set soon for my son's Jeep.  As soon as he saw these he wanted to steal them from me....
B00G0P0I60|5|Fits my 2007 Tundra perfectly, literally just push the cracked rubber out the way slides down between the wheel well. The new piece slides right over, looks perfect and a clean seal. I'll have to figure out how to get the debris out the bottom but for now its fine.
B00BFDG4QU|5|Replaced the original manufactured part and works just fine!
B00620SJPK|5|Loved them!!!
B0002JMUV6|5|Perfect fit....much  better than the Fram filter I used previously.<br />Seller delivered very fast and now I am going to purchase another of these for my sister.
B000EFOZEI|5|I spent a lot of time looking for replacement hubcaps, and most of the ones I saw were cheap and flimsy.  I took a chance on this product and am glad I did.  They are very solidly made, and easy to install.  Just make sure you install them so that the kink in the wire goes around the tire valve stem.  You'll need a bit of force to pop them in, but a few taps with my fist worked.  They've been on now for two months without any issues.  Please note that these are CLIP-ON hubcaps - not the kind that are attached via the lug nuts.
B00NVW772S|1|The ones I got are not the same as the picture, the front ones fit but the back ones don't,  very disappointed.
B005I575FK|2|This did not fit the bolts on my license plate which are 10mm standard car bolts.  Were way too big.  Would have been great if they did as they are just plastic caps to cover the bolts.
B00MGPUP70|5|👍👍👍
B00FSC3U52|5|I had to replace the Abs sensor while doing a wheel bearing (old sensor rusted in place). I researched prices and found Amazon to be the cheapest. After ordering I held my breath and was pleasantly surprised when my sensor showed up sooner than expected. It was a perfect fit, just as the oem, after reassembling the car the sensor performed as should. Very happy with my purchase from AIP electronics!
B001FCAXLS|5|just what i wanted
B000C9O3WU|5|Quality OEM part
B001HY5NX2|5|Great!!! On time. Excelent product.
B000C6IW6Q|5|Does the job @ a great price
B00CJ5DZE2|4|Good price..
B00DCYOAKM|5|Excellent quality.
B000CIFN02|5|Great long last material.
B00K6BGVMO|5|Very happy with purchase. Have bought other items for my JD-RSX 800 I sxs from STV Motorsports through amazon. Highly recommend. Always a 5 star rating seller.
B000KKENBM|5|Quick delivery, product as described. Heavy duty, looks well constructed
B004SRC6GM|5|Fit my 1997 Acura RL perfectly! Quiet, works great.
B005J5D062|1|Bought one and it failed in one month. Bought a second one that did not fit in spite of Amazon saying it would. These are the old design which is prone to break. Spend another $25 and buy a high quality one that works. Last I checked 2 x $50 is still more than buying a high quality one for $75. Further, the old design is a lot harder to install. Any design with the &#34;rat tail&#34; is the old design and this was of exceptionally poor quality. Deserves a zero. After one month, I should get my money back. Search online for the newer high quality design unless you want to deal with this nonsense over and over again. This one is a P.O.S.!
B00UW0HFXS|4|Ordered Hitch lock 2 inch ball and recived the 1-7/8 by mistake. Contacted seller, who immediately apologized and shipped the 2 inch model. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the devices have very small holes for padlock shackles. The 1.-7/8 has very small lock holes only very small shackled padlock (provided) is able to fit through the hole. While the 2 in ball size unit has a larger opening, it is still smaller than I would have liked. Again, a padlock that fits the device was included in the box. A big plus. I would recommend to the seller to increase the size of the overlapping locking tabs on his devices so that larger hammer proof locks can be used to lock the trailer. Overall a great idea with a better locking mechanism than most.
4678615343|5|Worked very well ,  not a cleaner,  did not expect to remove anything,  but it seems to make the vinyl much more receptive to paint.  That is what it is supposed to do.
B0041CBSN6|3|received it very fast. Product description says it is chrome. If it is chrome it is a very poor quality chrome. It looks more like a polished billet aluminum and even at that its not a very well polished piece. The piece also has quit a few pits in the &#34;chrome&#34; right next to the ignition hole and the speedo hole. Aside from the finish I will say I am impressed with the fit which is why i gave it three stars instead of two.
B00KI6M1G2|3|These are good lights but be aware that the double contacts on the bottom are plus/minus AND the base is grounded ALSO to the minus. The light I was hoping to replace (GE TS90) the base is shielded - i.e. electricity can (and ONLY) come through the two bottom contacts. This is easily tested/confirmed with an Ohmmeter.<br /><br />So turns out the interior lights on my (old - 1972) vehicle are controlled by turning the minus (ground) on/off. This is arguably a mistake, but not an issue with the original TS90 lights ... but it IS with these since the ground is always hot on the car so these lights will just stay on. Related to that is if you put them in the wrong way, you'll get a spark because the plus/minus will be shorted.<br /><br />Not worth it to return ... and they are good lights ... but knocking them down a few stars because the description should mention that.
B003RVMJIA|4|Reasonably priced, half the price from the dealer.  Not as sturdy as the original by good quality.
B000YC42RG|5|This system powers my train horns and I've used it to put air in my 35&#34; Nitto tires!
B00IQWP42I|5|Outstanding quality with 3M adhesive. Looks great on my Jeep Wrangler. Very impressed. Exceeds my expectations.
B00O3QB67S|5|It's amazing how much more you can see with this thing. Easy to install and gets rid of blind spots from either side. Normally I have problems with blind spots on the right side so I have it positioned like that.
B00EE3414K|3|No
B00VOB2CPK|5|Don't wait.... best upgrade I have made to my 4X4 Suburban smooth ride and never needs balancing again.
B000GZCU3O|5|Works will on my volvo xc 60
B0026PGN3A|1|This tire cover did not well at all.  It should probably state more clearly the actual model year Rav 4 that it actually is made for.  It did not fit a 2011 Rav 4.  Be sure you measure carefully.  Also, the only way to cinch it is to tie the cord in a knot so once you put it on its not coming off.
B00LCDMB0Q|5|Not the easiest to install but with a little patience you can get it done. Installed them with the wheels still mounted. For my 17&#34; wheels, I overlapped the tips of the tape and it looks amazing.
B003YIRHP6|4|The handling improved alot abd the look is noticeable to a real car guy or gal. But i was hoping for more. A 2 inch drop will do it but not this if your going stance. But this is kool if u want something cheap compared to coilovers. It does inprove the cars dynamics but if u want something serious  do coilvers but if ur budget is tight these will so just fine
B00N3446NC|3|The cross bars fit well, but I worry about the durability.  The ends are plastic and all of the weight on the metal cross bars are distributed on the plastic clamps and a single screw.  My car has a moon roof and I watched as the plastic bent under the weight of the load and the force of the wind as I drove down the road.<br /><br />Nothing has broken so far and they fit well, I may have to get different ones that don't flex so much.
B008KWF31Q|4|The only way these could be better is if they were painted with red to match the Umbrella Corp logo. I hand-painted the logo to remedy that.
B005EYSH3O|3|The product itself worked, it was 1/4 the cost of any others out there but was a pain in the ass to install and I'm not a amature mechanic. But once again, it did do the job so I would buy it again.
B00DIPSA8I|5|Perfect size
B000BVRZ74|5|The real benefit is during the day, whether you use your wipers or not, Rain-X will increase your visibility substantially.  You feel safer and more secure in rainy conditions than without it.<br /><br />During a torrential downpour travelling I-5 from Seattle to Portland, I never had to move my wipers up to full speed.  In normal rain going 45 or faster I don't even have to use my wipers; the rain just slides off.  At night, in almost any rain condition I never have to use my wipers.<br /><br />The original Rain-X is significantly better than the spray on cleaners or the stuff you find at the car wash.  Yes you have to spray, wipe, let dry, then buff off, but it'll be good for a month or more depending on use.  I live in the Northwest and I don't know why more people don't use this.
B00383SFBW|5|Perfect fit. Really catches your attention.  Hopefully product holds up to time.  Half the price of custom truck shops.
B001DCN1OG|5|Perfect replacement for my 2003 Honda Accord V6 Coupe hood stabalizers.  I really love the sturdiness of the strong arms.  Perfect replacement next to the OEM factory ones.
B00HUBXBBM|3|The  cushion is  ok but  the  covering  is  already  getting  thread  bare . have  only used  it  a few  times  and  the  covering  is very thin . not  good  at  all .  if  i had  known the  covering  was  so  thin i would  not  have  ordered  it  , thanks  what can be  done  about  the  covering  ?
B004PILLZG|5|Used to enclose factory sub location. Good value. No noticable smell.
B002OUMVWY|5|This is the second set we've purchased. The last one went to my brother's camper. This is the best sewer hose setup I've come across so far. Easy to use, easy to store, easy to route whether for temp drain or long term stay, Good quality stuff!
B0084NULYK|5|Received correct products ahead of schedule, always a bonus.
B00FFGZZ5Y|4|The printed ink will come off if it is rubbed up against firmly, but otherwise I like it and it is just what I was looking for.
B00FJW4QFO|5|Exact Fit, no problems. Much easier than trying to replace the bushings and ball joint seperately. Costs slightly more but saves much time, busted knuckles, and &#34;machine language&#34;!
B00HS5PB36|4|solid product
B0007VBUAQ|5|Great. Great. Cheap. And very usefull.
B00PXC5PNC|3|Lower quality gas cap. Plastic pin breaks off easily. Metal cover fades.  Better stick to Mopar original parts if you are looking for quality
B007WR25ES|4|Love all the space this gives but the straps are very confusing and hard to secure.....
B00XZ9PHYM|1|this is a very cheap key it looks like i should have a label on it saying &#34;made in china&#34; super cheap this is so not worth $40 i still have to get it cut to the original key which is another $40 plus the programing of the alarm my local lock smith gave me an estimate of $100 with the original key the cut and the programing!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!
B000IG3JJA|4|The drivers seat hole for the seat belt was way off but the seat covers are very nice.
B00757G9TW|5|perfect fit, helped out the handling
B000CB94IG|5|MANN filters are first choice for my German cars.  Great quality, fitment, performance at a reasonable price.
B0086RQ5BM|5|I made and installation video for this product if anyone is looking for guidance! https://youtu.be/r8dzHJLvMR0<br /><br />Love this product and it's great for the price! Arrived on time, if not sooner. Lights up perfectly and looks good day and night. Had close to no problems installing it. Other than I found out the black and red or positive and negative wires were switched on my emblems. The 3M tape is super sticky! Came a little scratched, not a big deal and it's not that noticeable. This item makes my car look great and I get tons of comments on it. People love seeing it at night. If you have a flashy personality and love transformers. I suggest this product. What's the hurt? 10/10 would get again. (I did buy 2)
B0012TZ1WK|5|Great product and service.
B002WPXVC0|5|Great
B00MPOU7CA|1|Weatherstripping is horrid. Terrible time installing weatherstripping. Window is good tho.
B00KCBPFHA|5|It looks nice and good.
B00VR6ZXR6|5|Very nice quality license plate frame at a very modest price!  The black finish was a great match for my 2015 Audi Q5 with the black trim/blackout grille option.  The frame is very solid and there are tabs at the bottom edge of the frame to hold the license plate securely.  If you have a 4-screw license plate holder, this may be a better choice - it solidly holds the license plate and obscures it a little less than the 4-screw model
B000S2UFXC|5|fit perfect
B00HYHX8EM|5|Fit perfectly.Easy to clean.
B000WP7JFM|1|This showed up on Amazon as being the right part for my 1989 Kawasaki Ninja 250, but they are not.  They are a well made spring and if they were right for my bike I would rate them 5 stars.  Just do some research before you order and make sure you get the right part for your bike.
B00IOAHRW2|1|Only one star because it would not fit on my quadra drive wj. I'm sure it would work fine on any other jgc. But they shoulda known that. So therefore, one star for wasting my time.
B009SHJH00|5|cool
B003VAXCWO|5|I use this to secure the tailgate of my truck. I have a locking tailgate already, this is just a added insurance for times that I forget to lock the tailgate.
B004U9B8O4|2|Locks got stolen within a month.
B00GBVHPV4|4|runs small
B000M8SY0I|4|Excellent product, works fine !!!
B004JO9FGI|5|Looks good, fits nice
B00KGICIJM|5|Hi ; the starter worked great and was a great price .
B00UBTQRXO|5|the item was as described and the time received was timely
B00VQTLN3C|4|Easy to install and has a variety of ways to position the plate
B000IYN5Q4|1|Terrible product. Bearings froze up on me in just 6-months.
B007CLM0M6|5|The light are great. I looks forward to driving at night every day. I will do future business with them.
B0009I2OIE|5|Easy Install and worked just as described.  My Jeep Liberty was given a trailer hitch by the manufacturer as part of some recall.  However, they didn't want to wire it. So, I got this kit and within 20 minutes, I was pulling a trailer with working lights.
B006EHXT92|5|Quiet. 1000 miles later, no issues!
B001C6OYVM|3|The auto down feature has already stopped working, and I've only had the switch installed since January 2015. Other than that, it operates fine.  UPDATE: One month later, the button for the driver's side window came off and I can't get it back on. The original lasted 16 yrs, so this wasn't from rough usage. Very disappointed in Dorman. Thought their parts were dependable. Will think twice before I order another Dorman replacement part.
B00BV6ERME|5|Fixed air bag service light on my 2005 Chevy 2500hd no problems easy fix
B00HZOD5C4|2|Not really fit, rather buy from Husky or Weather tech
B00W2XE0PO|1|This product originally stated that it fit a 2012 Honda CR-V, otherwise I would not have bought it.  It does not and never will.  BTW, this is one of those double sided tape ons.  Not the kind that fits inside the window slot.<br /><br />Yes, these will work just fine!
B000C9JQVS|5|Original. Recomendado
B00JK8DJH4|5|Husband and Father both love it. Easy to apply
B000EBKG5E|3|Not very comfortable for a pregnant lady.  Maybe after I am not pregnant, this cushion will feel better. Cheaply made.
B00NXRXXBU|5|Work and fit fantastic!
B007D7QMX2|5|Product was exactly what I needed
B00144I5KS|3|It's an OK product but it's kind of a pain to clean. A little overpriced too if you ask me.
B0002JMDAY|5|Excellent , lasts a long time shining
B0009YDQBM|3|Just average mats lasted 2 years and turned yellow.
B0026MCR4M|5|Arrived promptly, high quality and excellent fit, I recommend.
B00AXE635O|3|Works as expected, though difficult to separate layers.  A trick is to place scotch tape tabs on the outer layers to aide in separation.  Purchased this to protect my hood from the clamps of the bug deflector, seems like it is doing a great job so far for over a month.
B00YML13OU|5|great item for that new driver in your family that is trying to get use to the road  with their permit....
B000AM8BLI|5|I got exactly what I ordered when it said it would come.  No problems! I used it for my 1999 Toyota Corolla with no problems.
B00718W0Y8|4|Easy install, took maybe 20 minutes. I wouldn't say there is a noticeable difference in shift firmness, accuracy or tranny noise but compared to the stock bushing this one is far superior in quality, fit and function. Maybe it did something? Worth it for piece of mind for a couple bucks.
B00WSIEMGU|5|Great product... exceptionally bright!
B004QBNA8I|4|Just what i needed to fix the wife's car. Item came quickly.
B00KTJ0A0C|5|I recommend it. Very easy to instill.
B002W1OXW6|5|Love it will definitely purchase more hell look at the results
B00JHP92SA|5|Came on time, box was slightly damaged but the antenna worked great
B00X5FJS78|5|Excellent product
B009BNGAOM|3|They look good but a PITA since the bolt is not permanently fixed to the body.  And, no nuts included to secure the bolts.  I had to use loctite and buy lock nuts after one fell off my motorcycle. But very cool looking for my Triumph bike.
B00INVF6P2|5|i love it...as expected
B000IYHXO4|5|Originally mechanic infomed that my ABS sensor was shot so went with it but it turned out it was Axle Bearing. Shopped around and prices were pretty high and most weren't a familiar brand. Timken was familiar and I haven't had a problem yet. Not an easy install if your not experienced but any good mechanic can do it. I now know that if my passenger side goes that I can get this part on Amazon pretty quick through my Prime account and it works perfectly.
B000JFO1K6|3|Received this product today and was really disappointed that the entire thing was made of plastic! It states in the description that it is made of die cast chrome. It looks good but you need to know how misleading the description is. I hope it holds up good, my husband has been wanting this for a long time. The shipping time was good. Got it in 4 business days so I liked that.
B00EPPZQD2|3|Does not fit as expected....hat to beat on it.
B000E4B8C6|5|i love it...as expected
B000CBLX4E|4|Come on, it's an air filter. If it fits, then that makes it fine in my book. It fit.
B00BLCUFJW|1|Do not work!!!!'
B00G9C30SC|4|Good jeans for riding my bike, provide good protection.  I like them.
B001AY2WLU|2|great for emergencies out in the woods but falling off my keychain already and its only been a month or two
B007GR4VXC|5|Works great
B001QK1X5O|1|This lock is made in four pieces, and the fit is VERY loose.  I would not trust any asset to this lock as it would apparently disintegrate if struck with a hammer.  I expect better from Master Lock.  It is assembled in Mexico.
B007OWAKR0|5|Fast shipping easy to install and looks great. Installed on my 2009 Lexus is250.
B00JC7NS9C|1|I received white paint. Not red. Obviously was unable to use. The clear filler didn't work either.
B009DQHN0W|5|Awesome piece proudly displayed in my Firehawk.
B0023VBGPC|5|It fit perfectly!
B00REJX5BQ|4|Fits perfect as described. My only complaint the lock down handles the adjustment screw appears to be soft metal it bent on me while latching on the first attempt after install. I corrected the issue but you must be careful or it can make the latch handle unusable.
B000EDST6K|5|I had a Pop-a-Bowl in my camper.  We used it frequently.  A camper does not have much storage space, but this mounts to the bottom of a cabinet or wherever and takes very little space.  However, the bowls are very accessible. I loved it so much, I bought one for home.  It is made of plastic and has been very sturdy so far.  It comes with the items needed to mount it.  They only tool you will need is a screw driver.
B005BNZGCS|5|Product was an exact fit, performs as it should and at a great price.  Will buy from this company again.
B00DSVMCRC|5|Great quality, thought it would be cheap and fake leather. It's real and very great quality. Highly recommended
B0057DEKBK|5|Gamecocks show your pride.
B000GRY6BQ|5|Fits well,,looks good
B001KSE0CU|5|It quieted the thunk at a great price.
B002XUXUTS|1|Beeps  when there's nothing there and doesn't beep when there is. Adjusted in different angles  Still not consistent
B00BITKCPA|5|Worked fine, came when it was expected.
B00TQHHCTK|3|This gage is nice to handle, reading about 3 psi low to all my other gauges, but it is consistently low, so not a big deal as long as you check it against other gages when you buy it.
B004CTI5XO|5|Perfect fit on the 2012 BMW 528i RWD
B000KL1EJ0|5|It need to be trimmed to fit, other than that, the product work great.
B00W328UCS|5|I'm glad these are still available.  The campaign has moved on to a different slogan.  This is still drives the point home.
B006RXPV4Y|3|I guess it's OK.  I haven't used it because I decided to get screw-on lids.
B0023VBHA6|1|It was defective,was able to repair it. but took 1.5hrs to assemble the reflector inside the headlight assy.
B00B8YN7J8|5|factory brand name perfect!
B001HLIMD8|3|A little too warm for this time of year
B00ONH1NQ6|5|Very good
B00IAARHTO|5|They're so pretty! I loved then so much
B000GX7FLI|5|Installed four plugs on 2.0 liter engine in 2002 Jetta station wagon with 190,000 miles.  Engine functioning properly.
B000B69V7Q|5|Quality replacement
B000DZDHU2|5|Using this as a cheap alternative for a 1958 Evinrude 18hp Fasten I rebuilt recently. The hole in the metal insert is tad smaller than the called-for 7/32&#34; rope but can be easily drilled out to size. It's a tight fit but works well, considering a genuine replacement is hard to find and at least $30. Works well so far.
B00BT1GWGK|5|excellent fit worked great
B009SQBNGC|5|I was having issues with finding this kit.  This kit worked like a charm.  No issues, no worries, just bliss and ease of mind.<br />I would buy it again and would recommend it to anyone!!
B0028JW4PU|5|For the price i was delighted with the operation of this jack. I use it to jack up my truck and my riding lawn mower. The jack is heavy and should be used on a hard surface. I really like it.
B004AG9H5Y|5|Fits our ml500, matched with akebono pads, flushed and bled the brakes with Super DOT4. Firmer pedal, seems to stop quicker, and wheels stay cleaner longer....
B0027YWZY6|1|WARNING:  DANGER!<br /><br />THIS item has a DEFECT in it's LOCKING mechanisms which, I believe, Could cause SERIOUS INJURY to those working with heavy objects!<br /><br />ABSOLUTE GARBAGE....<br /><br />Several Times during USE the CABLE became ENTAGLED within the SPOOL causing it to LOCK-UP right-in-the Middle of Moving a very Large Item.  It was a TOTAL DISASTER trying to RELEASE the TENSION.  I could have really been HURT.<br /><br />THIS ITEM IS NOT SAFE.
B006K8WFYU|5|Works great!
B00CUNVHEI|5|worked awesome!
B0009IQZFM|5|Really does a nice job of drying a vehicle.  easy on the surfaces.
B00SDMJLQ6|1|I have a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee, and the extenders don't fit.
B00IGZQT38|5|Fast shipping Perfect fitment
B000BPLNXC|4|A good product for the price.
B00SR1QEAY|5|Works great in my Chinese GY6 scooter. Even came with new tubing, fuel filter and electronic choke. All bonuses I didn't expect.
B009FREAGO|4|it does the thing, but its a bit small imo
B00ZSUVZD8|5|very useful
B001QVF7IM|5|Very good product
B00LMRE326|5|It's exactly what I expected.
B00A0D93L4|5|My fuel pump in my 2010 ford ranger quit on me this morning at 8:00 am. I ordered a new one at 11:30 with same day shipment it arrived at 5:30 just as i was removing old one. Dropped in new one turned key and away i go half the price of local auto parts store thank you AMAZON YOU ROCK!<br />and the spectra fuel pump fit like a glove plug and play easy easy easy ! I would give 10 stars if i could. taking off the bed of the truck was the hardest part but worth it. local shop wanted $900.00 to do the job. No thanks ill keep my $$$
B00G1Y51R6|2|I installed these on my 2011 Suzuki GSXR 600, and eventually had to remove the clutch side. The levers look great, but the clutch lever does not want to seat properly on the clutch switch. I first tried to uninstall, re-grease the barrel, and reinstall the lever, but this was to no avail. The improper seating causes the bike to throw an Fi light and eventually will cause a stall when returning to neutral from a higher RPM range. I would not recommend these levers for this reason.
B000JZY6O2|5|Worked well not too hard to install.
B00UG3R8EW|5|Nice quality
B003YI421I|4|Good product, produces reliable bonds on difficult materials like motorcycle fairings. I gave it only 4 stars because the glue is a bit thin and drips easily. The powder filler provided doesn't apply well and can make an ugly repair if the cyanoacrilate (super glue) drips from a vertical repair location. Super glues can lose their bond over time, so I will have to wait to see if the cracks reappear.
B000P6US1U|5|Good price.  Works.
B003COTFS4|5|BARELY FITS A 2016 Honda foreman 4x4 power steering.<br />It fits by a hair. Very awsome winch
B000BNH0WW|4|No snaps, easy to install, fit perfectly. Only concern is back tailgate area - opens fine, but you have to make sure you're under the lip before closing. Rubbing there may cause premature wear, time will tell.
B001C6OZ48|5|Easy install. Correct fit. should have gotten these 60000 miles ago.
B0045YSI56|1|website wrong....not my shade of paint
B001DSWB46|5|Very easy install. The pedal feel improved greatly. This is a must have upgrade for any LBZ.
B005JV6VTE|5|Great hood very pleased
B0084L0YR6|4|It was easy to install and did a great job
B00NCK08IY|2|The water pump was Aisin, the belt was no-name.  I was expecting it to include the hydraulic tensioner, it did not.  I read back through the description of what items were included.  On the &#34;included list&#34; was Hydraulic tensioner....... (not included).  I feel duped.  It arrived on time, it was packaged well.<br /><br />make sure you compare apples to apples.
B00SZK26T0|2|i bought these because it says that they are 5000k, they are not even near the 5K, they are around 6K to 6.5K. they are not bright, the halogen stock bulbs was brighter than these, very disappointed with this purchase.
B00JK322MW|5|Sending our daughter off to college, we wanted not only her dorm room, but her car to be equipped also. These booster cables fit so neatly in their case, , no jumbled mess int he trunk. A must have for any car!
B008R5LI56|2|The stock speaker on my galaxy dx959 is louder than this little speaker.  Audio quality is pretty tinny.
B00D7HZ6FC|5|I bought this to restore the battery on our portable generator.  The battery had deteriorated from sporadic use. I followed the instructions, attached the battery minder and within a day the battery was useful again. I presume the desulfactor function was at least partially responsible for restoring the battery.  Regardless, we will leave this attached to the battery so that it is ready to go the next time we need the generator.
B00DHVEXIE|5|Looks and feels great in my 1992 Honda Prelude.
B000EDQR4Q|5|These were a food saver! While traveling, one could not open our RV refrigerator without something falling out. Now using these refrigerator bars keeps everything in place. I am glad that I bought them.
B008PO635Y|4|First of all, if you spray the proper way while using this product it will do as its meant for.  People complaining that it doesn't spray like a $900 Sata Professional Paint Gun are just people who put little thought in to the logics of life.  LOGIC 101 Folk - Brand Name is key, Plastic Coat, now does that sound like it will spray like then automotive thinner mixed HLV paint? Especially since your buying in a spray can which has a needle size pin hole.  Ok to get the best results,(1) read the directions and shake that dang can for how ever many minutes it ask you to plus some because its no such thing as over shaking but there is such thing as under shaking. (2) spray exactly the distance it says to spray from (3) ALWAYS keep the can level straight up and down most splatter happens when its not sucking pure paint and you get intermittent spray with aerosol cause splatter (4) NEVER EVER stop spraying for more then 3-5 Minutes without cleaning the tip out by simply flipping can upside down and spraying until the paint stops, usually 1-2 seconds is long as it takes to clear it out.  (Tips) the best painters arnt just the steady hand artist but they are master body/paint prep workers as well.  Always sand smooth but textured enough to bond to.  On anything metal, you must use a paint prep cleaner or wipes to remove all the oils off the surface of the metal or it wont stick just gets tacky and or fisheyes.  Be smart people.  Would be a five star rating but the price is a tad bit to high and no one ever has full line of products in stock.  Color shouldn't change price either.  Other then that I give it 4 stars awesome product

B000C3ZDSO|2|1998 Ford Expedition.  These are what all sites suggest on the part number but they are a bit short compared to originals.  When the front end is jacked up all the spring tension rests on this shock.  Also the bottom tabs did not match up correctly and I had to modify slightly.  I have KYB's on 2 of my other vehicles.  Seem to be holding up on my 1 ton truck.  But a front one is leaking on my Impala after 1 1 /2 years.  Lifetime warranty from KYB but still have the labor
B003VAV7XK|3|Hose not long enough to reach wall. Other parts ok.
B004GCEM6Q|5|very good part
B00U3N0KTA|5|works great
B003KKFBVA|3|Try silicone gaskets instead. Perfect seal, no replacement needed.
