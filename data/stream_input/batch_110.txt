B001UQ6RK0|5|bought the same suit at nordstroms in the winter for full price - wore it out.  great replacement at great price
B00M8ZR64S|4|Not as soft as expected.
B00DUFXRAM|5|Belt and slider buckle are packaged nice enough for gift giving and arrive quick.  I like the many adjusting sizes  and does not use holes in leather to wear and go bad quickly.  Second step, learn how the buckle  unlatches, in case you are in a hurry to unlatch<br />as another reviewer commented in his review.  What he said can be very true.  Know your equipment and don't assume it comes natural to operate.  It  is simple, but might not come natural, the motion to unfasten the buckle.  I recommend the  slider buckle.<br />Larry
B00192TJ5K|1|I thought I had bought these many times before, but when they arrived they were way too small. I had also gotten the Kirkland brand size 38 and they were fine.  I would have returned these if my son were not able to wear them, being a size 35-36.
B00AX6QXYS|5|Was such a hit for mardi gras got so much attention wearing it. Held enough liquor for a couple of hours.
B008LY4CWO|5|Excelente marca
B00C01MIPC|5|Love fits the booty
B0021WK8SO|3|A bit baggy in a medium for 5'9 and 137 lbs.  Also a bit short.  The waistband is bunchy elastic - not too sleek.  A little old-ladyish.
B007LPLO0W|2|I loved it when I took out of box. and tried it on and fit nicely.  I bought this for a reunion . so the night I put it on it was very hot so I waited last minute. So I put it on and im waiting for my ride and AS im walking out the door the front elastic part starts coming apart! NO TIME for me to do anything but grab a sweater so at least i can cover myself up . it looked horrible  and i was disapointed because its a beautiful dress I LOVED the colors and the way it was cut. Too bad it fell apart. i prob wont buy from this seller again. They did promptly refund my money  and I really did like the dress until it fell apart.  thats  why i gave this two  stars.
B00SF73ZCK|2|It runs small, I can fit it though.
B005GE6JOG|4|My nearly three year old really wanted to be an alligator for Halloween. I found this costume and it looked cute and was about what I wanted to spend. I read the reviews that said the costume ran small. I ordered a child's small, which I thought was a 4 - 6, for my nearly three year old son who is on the small side. (He wears clothes in size 24 months.) The costume will get him through Halloween but that is it. The length (height) of the costume is tight on him and his neck shows. But he still looks cute. So, I recommend the costume - but make sure you order it plenty big.
B00OY8ODZW|5|Love
B00Q8OXEXW|5|SUPER FAST SHIPPING.  Beautiful gown....we'll see if it's the &#34;one&#34;
B004UUK056|4|Great for a halloween costume.
B008XQRU2E|5|Excellent product.
B00J1HFR9M|1|Horrible, cheap quality
B00498CQBA|5|This is the cutest little black dress!!! Very good bargain for the price!!!! Versatile!!! Can be worn to a formal event or to a concert...for the grown and sexy!!! I love it!!! Very flattering!!! I definitely recommend!!!
B008Q0E61U|5|ty :)
B00SWJVDES|5|Beautiful dress, a bit too big but overall very pleased. Arrived before promised, a very smooth transaction. I will definitely order from Avenue again.
B000W8ZQTK|5|I sent this to my grand nephew for Christmas. My sister told me that he immediately began to wear it as soon as he opened it! Pretty cool, huh?
B009K1QQKS|3|its okay, i like hello kitty alot, but i wish it didnt have symbols on the back that i cant read
B000C31AG8|5|very comfortable.  I usually wear a 34dd/ddd and this fit fine
B0002TORBM|5|Took a long time for delivery but very satisfied.
B00IWRGF2K|1|Cheaply made.
B00AFCOSE2|4|pretty and comfortable
B00AINQCKG|5|They fit very well, the feeling is great. They are not too thick and not too thin.  They go very well with my beige pants.
B010SDW0E2|5|great belt for casual use
B0064Y4GRE|4|I love these type of pants.  I usually wear an XL and these fit as I expected them to.  They do stretch out a bit, so be prepared for that, but great value and would definitely order again.
B00H8OWAJ0|4|could be a little bigger  ,but its ok.
B005WUIQP4|5|The material is very high quality and it's not see through. The color is gorgeous. It does run on the small side so like other reviewers said, size up if you are unsure.
B00167VSVQ|5|I was impressed by the quality of the material. Light weight fabric which is very comfortable for me. I wear that through the summer season and it's so comfortable that I sometimes forget I'm wearing a high suit.
B007FZIMQC|5|goods match the description. fast delivery.
B0009VCBQQ|5|Love this skirt, fits well, just as advertised. I would recommend this dress to al the ladies out there! It is beatiful.
B00FPIBXBM|1|to to small one wash it dumd......
B00NMQDA06|5|Gorgeous dress, really comfy, true to size. Wrap dresses are the way to go :) I'm size 4, 5'9&#34; and the dress is perfeclty knee length and the sleeves are actually long enough!  Super happy.
B00DR6GQ2K|3|Other than my 7 year old son being obsessed with Sonic right now, a reason we bought this one was because it said it had a zipper pocket. My son hoards loose change. However, I can't find a zip up pocket anywhere in it. Son still loves it though.
B00LAIH4I2|5|Very cute and spacious which is nice and fits with design.
B00BSQM7AG|3|Had some bleeding of the colours.
B00P90GKNW|3|Way small. Bit decent quality
B00DCN2WPS|4|They're long, so it fits any size you need it to. I got exactly what I ordered, all the colors and everything. There's a bendy wire inside the fabric, which lets you tie it and bend it any way, any style. It may not have been worth ten dollars, but it's still a good buy.
B00R8M1Z0C|3|Gloves to small for my four year old.
B00KYLVBMQ|5|Very comfortable, washable, and size-flexible.  These slippers have skid-resistant bottoms, lots of room and stretch,<br />and are cute enough.  They also come in a variety of colors.  They'd make a good gift, too, due to the fact that the fit is so<br />forgiving.
B000FAHIW8|5|My son was very happy with these pants and found them very comfortable and fit well. He also liked the color.
B00ARDD6OC|5|the clothes are beautiful and good quality, I agree, get the required size, in perfect condition and well packaged, thank you very much, is a responsible seller, would recommend 100%
B008L4BP9W|2|size was not accurately represented compared to other brands
B003WE9J76|5|Super versatile, warm and durable vest. I was never a \\"vest person\\" until purchasing this vest. Since I've expanded my collection but the goust vest sees the most wear time!
B007HJFCRS|5|I was looking for a front close bra that was simple and easy to hook. I found it. This is my new favorite bra.
B00O194N90|3|Nice shirt but it is a little small.
B00AQTYSLW|5|just as you would expect  adds another inch or so  I am wider around amd I hate tight bras!  this really helps so much!
B00QKXBEVK|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE
B006IIWJ6Q|5|it's not so thick, but the quality is good.... so soft and very good for spring or autumn^^<br />small is so fit for me~~
B004XYIZO2|4|Socks are nice, but since the sizing is a bit confusing, here is some help...<br /><br />These socks are sized in inches, the numbers will be about the length of the child's feet.<br /><br />Here are some rough guidelines to help you choose the size:<br /><br />Size 5-6 socks = Size 3 to 7-1/2 shoes = 1 to 2 years<br /><br />Size 6-7 socks = Size 6 to 11-1/2 shoes = 1-1/2 to 4 years<br /><br />Size 7-8 socks = Size 9 to 1-1/2 shoes = 3 to 7 years<br /><br />Size 8-9 socks = Size 12 to 6-1/2 shoes = 5 to 10 years
B00IJ2VIFW|5|I ordered a few different suits from injoy. Loved them both!:) this one looked very cute on. Its made from really good quality material and will last! Hot item!!
B000ZX8SU6|5|The person who received this t-shirt loved it....of course, he is the DRUMMER in two bands!!  Would recommend this brand!
B00E5AE890|5|I bought this for my fourteen year old son for Christmas, along with two other hoodies.  This is the only one he'll wear!  I wish I would have just bought three of these in different colors.<br /><br />It's really soft, is a fitted style and looks great on him.
B000E3BRM8|5|This belt serves as a perfectly normal belt, plus a great place to hold money.  Would recommend to any man.
B00AUDWWC6|5|LOVE this bra, very comfortable and the design of the bra is pretty and soft for a larger bust size.
B006SRT0WI|5|I need something keep me warm when I have lake fishing in winter. This is what I want.<br />Some reviewers complained about the smell, but I could not smell. I love this Duofold.<br />Midsize is perfect for me. I am 6 and skinny.
B0037YRT14|3|I was looking for a nighty which is not see through. It does not look like on the net,but this one is. But I would not say that this is a minus point of this product.  The quality is not so good.  The good thing about it is that it feels very soft.
B00P2O9Y7E|5|Love this coat!
B00PQOTL5A|1|Too small and there no invoice enclosed at time. Therefore no way to return product for a refund.
B00ICTENB8|5|I love these socks!  Picked up a pair as a stocking stuffer this Christmas (argyle mustaches) and they are great!  I had to get many more!  The planets are cool.  They fit well and the pattern isn't stretched out or anything.  They stay up and look awesome!
B00CIA3WDM|5|Perfect
B00KXGH9X2|5|Very good quality. Fit perfect and received very quickly.
B00CESFX76|5|Really cute dress. Fits perfectly. The heart belt is cute too. My daughter really likes this dress a lot. She matches other contrasting belts with it too.
B002QECK60|4|it's very pretty, i wish i was a bit larger, also you have to iron it after you wash it. I love scarves from MIR
B00V9Q1NGY|5|I love it
B0070TOPUU|5|Very comfortable, perfect fit, high quality night shirt.
B008XFATEG|3|Everyone seemed to have problems with the sizing of this item and the item posting was vague, so I went with a size large for my 8 year old daughter.  It is very slim in the middle but was way too long.  She ended up wearing it like a dress with leggings to a concert so it was really cute, but she will wear it as a nightgown in the future.
B00K4TJR6K|5|Great jeans, fits well and looks stylish on me. Absolutely love it!
B00DBJ73UC|4|I love the feel and color of this tank.  Its a little thinner than I expected but I do like it.
B0088VTZAO|1|I bought a hoody for men and i got womens hoody instead. It's not really the same to wear. I'm not happy
B00LAQLNYU|1|This necklace arrived ahead of schedule which was very nice. I was excited to open the box and try it on, but the product is very low quality. The clasp is large and I've never seen one like it before. The top flower on each side looks unfinished (I do see that now in the picture, but did not notice before). Do not buy!
B00GLQAJN0|5|So pretty!
B007PZQHLY|5|COMPRE ESTOS PANTALONES CORTOS PARA LA PLAYA EN LAS BACACIONES, ME GUSTARON MUCHO ME QUEDADN BIEN, LATALLA PRECISA, EL COLORES EL MISMO QUE EXIBEN, LA TELA BUENA Y LA CONTRUCCION IGUAL. YO RECOMIENDO ESTOS PANTALONES CORTOS.
B00KMGJNU0|5|They stay on my butt.  And are very comfortable.
B005ZZB0OA|5|I searched everywhere for a girly elmo shirt and then found this one. It is a HUGE winner with my daughter, she LOVES it!! Great quality for a great price.
B00TZDGYD0|1|The shirts run small. I normally. Were a medum and i got a large and it waspritty tight
B0097B8CQ2|5|only downside i can find would be that the pockets aren't real, but hey thats not very big. This thing is cozy like a sweater and has a very well put together-ness about it. Do note that if you are a small person, get the small; i got the medium after reading reviews about how it was smaller than expected, but i should have really gotten the small.
B0020ML3DE|5|Love these socks.  They are higher than some that I have which are just below the ankle bone and feel as though they cut circulation or slip down into my shoes.  These are perfect, soft and comfortable.  Highly recommend.
B00XQG5BHC|5|I recently tried out the SHARKK case and the Radix slim wallet after deciding to replace my magic wallet. I wanted something a little thinner and smaller than the magic wallet. I typically carry only my ID, a credit card or two, and some (paper) insurance cards, so I had no need for anything bulky. This one also blocks RFID scanners, so it was an extra plus (though I haven't tested it out yet). No complaints. The SHARKK case and Radix slim wallet required some getting used to (e.g., opening and closing a case or pulling a card out between the elastic band), but this one was an easy transition. I'd recommend this one for anyone who wants a traditional wallet but in a slim profile.
B00DJBQA6K|5|This scarf is very nice looking.  I was worried but the person I gave it to loves it.
B00QUGNWJO|3|Never bought this brand before so since I've had sizing issues I took an xl. A large would have been a better fit and maybe a medium if I wanted a tight fit. Lots of stretch and nice material. Very black and nice length, just above the knee . I'm a US14 with minor adjustments and 5'1.
B003XVYBMG|3|It fit almost as expected although it was an XL child's rather than an XS women's.  The problem was it was too wide, and not long enough.  It was also very see through.  It worked for the first show, but I had to run to Kohl's and replace it with a camisole white top.
B00SUCZ9BU|3|Does not fit true to size.  Nice suit, but the arm length is way too short.  It is the same as the size smaller.  Frustrated because the pants fit but the jacket is too small.
B00LEXY3UK|5|great shirt moves with you and pleanty warm
B008B803J6|4|Fits great and love the cape.
B00KXAOA6C|5|Very comfortable. Purchased as a replacement band because I very seldom remove my bands. Why buy from any other merchant but Susan G. Komen.
B0085TGGVU|5|My husband loves his shirt. He has worn it at least twice and has commented on it more than once. It has a great texture, pockets he loves to use, and is true to his size. We will get more of these shirts!:)
B00IRLBGS4|5|awesome
B008EXX67Y|5|A+
B005VU1LQ6|3|I'm 5 ft. tall, and a 32-36 inch crinoline would fall around my knees. This one barely came down to my lower thigh. It was like it was a petticoat for a small child - not for an adult.
B0001YRBWK|3|these run a size smaller than they really are.....
B003OB63LM|4|Great shirt, very comfortable. Nice and airy.
B004U4OJQS|3|My daughter is a bit taller than average for a 10 year old, so I decided to order a size 12.  When the \\"dress\\" arrived, I was fearful that it was going to be too big because it was actually a size 12/14.  When my daughter tried it on, there was not much moving room in the chest and arms (it fit perfectly, tho not for long) BUT the length didn't even go halfway to her knees!  My daughter really likes the style, especially the cowl neck, but there is no way on earth I would allow her out of the house wearing it as a dress.  It is a belted shirt, and she will need to wear black pants.  (The fabric is also very thin.)
B0002OEVYU|5|The second I saw these I knew I had to get some for my woman, Bell, cause I like metal, you know, guns and steel and workin on my swamp boat, and I Looooove womans underwear, not like weird stuff, just on her, most of the time, cause I have an open mind and all, and not that its any of yer business anyway, but this is HOT HOT HOT metal and she aint too impressed, but I notice she always puts them on when she comes over to my moms trailer to watch me play on my playstation and sometimes I cant even see straight when she wears her denim skirt and the sun reflects off them and I end up dyin a lot, but thats ok.
B00T4AVT98|5|So cute.
B002SW3EUG|5|They're cute and exactly what I wanted! Just wished our kiddo kept them on his head! I would recommend these to other parents.
B00BWTG7OG|5|We have two of these now. My 2 & 4 year old boys love them. Perry is a hit and they are great for keeping the sun off the boys!.
B004MVHJWU|4|Very cute outfit and arrived in timely manor. Material really thin and must be ironed after washed or will be really wrinkled but overall very cute outfit! I have bought many mudpie outfits, this is not one of my favs.
B00PMBIAQ8|5|The fabric is soft, the design cute, the fit very comfortable.
B00FS70K0U|5|This was a present and besides the baby girl wearing the had at all times, everyone gives complements and ask about where to buy one
B001EIT7U6|5|ecxelent
B00EMG3WIA|5|highly recommended
B00M7AB5CI|5|Love this shirt.  We went to a big 1970's Classic disco party where some of the outfits were amazing. That being so, our outfits with the orange disco shirt were a huge hit.  Everyone was taking our pictures like paparazzi.  The fit is good, if not a little large around the waist.  I think that we will have them tapered/fitted for the next wearing, but the product is excellent.  Very high quality!
B0087JBS7K|5|same as shown in the picture I love it, and its perfect for winter time
B001AIWSYW|4|i love these bras.  I had three already and ordered more on Amazon because I live overseas and cant find them here.  I highly recommend for large busted women.  they are comfortable for ALL DAY wear.  Very supportive and flattering!
B00EDIMN0A|5|I purchased to go with the matching Dearfoams Women's Flip Gloved with Sherpa Lining which I also purchased. I purchased this for a relative for her birthday. She likes to go on walks and is an older person. She loved it. This is nice material and well made. Worth the price.
B00KTHY7B2|2|I'm a size 12 - the arm holes in this top were very tight and the length was barely below my waist.  Not as pictured.  Unusually because I bought a similar stle dress from Sakkas and it fits great!
B00BPFXZ8I|5|We bought this dress as a costume for Oktober Fest and find it is more than a costume !<br /><br />The quality is outstanding. This is beautifully made and is an exact duplicate of the dress you would find in Bavaria.<br /><br />It really is a quality dress and will last a life time !
B00DR1EZ8M|5|I like the slide option.  The ability to customize the length is a real plus.
B003HQI4F2|3|This dress is a good value.  It fits well and looks nice.  The only problem was I ordered it in gold and hot pink arrived instead.  Also, the feather had already come off the headband, so I never got to wear that piece.  Still, not a bad deal for the price, since the dress was the main thing I was interested in.
B00H8VXIEY|5|Excellent buy, warm and soft
B00I1LM55S|3|Needs another pocket, otherwise just OK
B00NL8P4R2|3|Good quality but sizes run small
B00BOHKF9Y|4|This is a sweet shirt. Kind of see through. Wish it were a little longer and a little bigger. But it will do
B00EE0ZNB8|5|I'm short (5ft) 130lbs and chesty (34DD for now...) and this bra gives me the lift without cutting into my shoulders, my armpits, my ribs, or anything else like a full coverage bra normally does... and I don't have to worry about it choking me all the way to my collar bones. Just because I have curves, does not mean I want to dress up in my grandma's bra. These bras also last forever. I've been buying them for the past 3 years and they are the only ones I'll wear, even through a pregnancy, breast feeding, and major weight gain. Ugh. They stood the test of gravity. I have five different colors, one for each mood I might be in. They are smooth under any kind of shirt, low cut enough that they are incapable of being seen peaking out from the tops of my clothes, and they give you subtle curves with the very light padding, that is so light you can barely call it padding. With how picky I am, I don't care what kind of chest you have, this bra will put you in your place... and make you pretty at the same time.
B00NVO1BWI|5|Really nice!
B00CFHAD8A|4|Just what my daughter needed to have a coat like daddy's sleeves were a tad long but not a big deal at all
B00I93AUNW|5|I bought this dress for My daughter. Its beautiful and the back of the dress is perfect in case you need to loose it a little.<br />It took around 3 weeks to get here!
B0091GWJ8A|5|Fits beautifully. Comfortable, good support, good &#34;lift&#34; and minimizes that unfortunate bra line in sides and back. Great price and the best bra I've found in years.
B00TKPE3L8|5|Great shirt. Great price. I'm happy with my purchase
B000JIH8WQ|1|This is a really cheap product. But I'm not sure i even got what I paid for. Wouldn't recommend it. Try Lamaze.
B00E9TDYAG|5|I bought this dress for a performance but sadly it was not appropriate.  That weekend, I wore it to a party and I could not stop getting compliments.  For one, the lace in front is very eye catching.  The open back is also great part of the dress.  The bottom part is made out of a silky material which feels nice against your legs but tends to ride up when walking/ dancing.  Also, it comes with a thong!  Which i thought was adorable.  Overall, lovely lovely dress, great price and you will not be disappointed!
B00AG3XPJ4|4|Its really cute and flares nicely. It is a bit short though. I'm 5'6&#34; 110lbs and the small fits perfectly. Would not wear it on a windy day though, it falls only a few inches past my bottom.
B0059UYCGE|5|Beautiful blue thick and cozy.  My girl loves it.
B00JU2KFYA|5|My little ballerina loves this shirt.
B00E7Z7RSM|5|See I cant find a hat that fits my head right and looks cute but this hat did the trick. It fits perfectly and is super comfy. I would defiantly recommend it for any Doctor Who fans out there.
B0002BH5KA|5|Cannot beat the quality for the price. Very comfortable from day 1, do not really need to be broken in.
B008DJ2616|5|I LOVE THIS SHIRT! I was so excited when I got this in the mail! I recently started watching Dr. Who for the very first time, and I fell in love! I am so happy to have this shirt in my wardrobe and show my love for such an amazing show!
B00RB3JHYE|3|Product runs VERY small
B0064POTNO|5|This shirt is fantastic - great quality.  The shirt stands up to repeated washing and drying wihtout losing shape or size, the color is mainained through repeated wear and washing. My teenage son wears this shirt very often and it really stand up against wear and tear.
B00NTM6AQO|5|Exactly what I was looking for to wear at my Goddaughter's bday party. I'm 5'2&#34; and had to get it hemmed as it was 10 inches too long but for this price, even with the $12 it cost to get hemmed it was still a bargain compared to other dresses out there. Arrived promptly and made alot of little girls very happy :)
B00G4FFDA2|5|perfect fit got size 2-4 my daughter is 3. very warm and cozy fleece throughout not like some hats that don't fleece the inside top of that hat. great quality. i will be purchasing another set for my younger daughter.
B000RMI16G|1|How can Amazon allow this sort of thing? It's absolutely disgusting and wrong, and, as a graphic designer, let me add how ugly it is. Kick this seller off the network already, Amazon! How hard is that?
B00O6DZSE0|3|Quality us good.I just have a big head .
B00GS7F9FK|3|The helmet is nice and fits good but the nose piece was not attached. Trying to figure how to fix it
B00BNV2YBS|4|These are shorter than they appear on model but they are the most comfy shorts. Colour is great I purchased the neon coral and I lovely with pinks and reds on top
B006Q1A0Y8|5|The first of these hats ordered was too large entirely due to a mistake on my part - I must have clicked on the wrong size.  I like the had enough that I was able to visit the &#34;home office&#34; here in MN last summer and buy a lighter weight one.  Very friendly folks who seemed committed to meet customer expectations.  I have recommended Barmah hats to some friends and am planning to get another light weight one with a chin strap this summer.
B00FMMV4GU|5|My nephew loved these!
B000PUFIRA|1|I purchased six of the same hats eight years ago in my size and used one a year until they were gone. Then I put in an order for another bunch. In the meantime they changed the product and left the lot number the same and removed the size feature. Now they don't fit at all. One size fits all whether you are a chimpanzee or an elephant. I couldn't even find a way to reduce the size by putting material in the inside band. There wasn't any. I returned them all as unusable. In the future I will just pick up one at a store as I need them so I can try them on.
B00BMJ0WKG|5|i just got this product today and i like it a lot,it was a cute color combination,and i like the way it looks!!
B004RLJB58|2|Expecting so much from Spanx, and it just kind of smooths if you want to look thinner this is not your product, kind of smooths the body but creates a very ugly looking line on the waist where everyone will notice you are using spanx, I am not even super sized I'm a size 8-10 and ended up giving it to my super skinny cousin after trying it on, awful, and expensive, not recommended at all. The two stars because the quality is good.
B00T4JE9OG|5|Can't believe this jumpsuit was so inexpensive. Looks and fit as if it should cost a lot more. The &#34;caplet&#34; really covers flaws such as a bigger belly and the shape of the neckline make the bust quite attractive. Instead of using cheaper lightweight material, it is constructed with a great mid-weight poly/spandex material which makes it fantastic for traveling. Very comfortable.<br /><br />You can dress it up or down. It will work either way. At 5&#34;2 I expected to have to hem it by about 4 1/2 inches. If you're handy with the needle, due to the way it drapes, it is an easy job. Really wish it came in more colors. I would buy them all!
B006OPIH50|5|I got these on sale and they are really cool. Great for anyone looking to acquire zettai ryouiki-- It's stretchy, so you can make them over the knee for Grade B or all the way to your thigh for Grades A and S. They are really comfortable and soft, too. They aren't really see through, but when they stretch around your knee they kind of shimmer, like in the picture.
B00DGM5202|5|Fits my son very comfortably.  Product is true to size.  We put it on our boy when we are watching the Giants play because the colors are very similar.
B00D7NIA54|5|I had some hesitation with the thought that my order would have to cross the ocean, but those fears were put to rest when my pants came a week earlier than expected. It was a pleasant surprise to see the little \\"we missed you\\" note left by the post office. A quick trip to my local USPS building and boom new pants straight from Thailand. Shipping gets an A+<br /><br />The pants themselves did not disappoint either. The discription matches perfectly with the final product. And as an added bonus the pants came with a little string bag for easy storage. If I had one complaint about the pants at all it's that the seams seem to be lacking in the strength area, but that's not to say they arnt worth it. I've only had these pants for two days and that is my initial observation. But hey if they end up failing the seams are simple enough that an unskilled yahoo like me can fix it with thread and needle. Product gets an A<br /><br />I highly recommend these pants and this company. My experience with them has been excellent! Thank you so much.
B00CDLDUJ2|5|nice shirt again the medium is too small
B00Q7GA01K|4|They fit great. Although I'm a true size 2, I ordered the 3 to be safe and they fit well. I ordered a size 1 in another pair similar and I could fit them but these are a better fit. They seem to be fairly true to size as a 2 would have fit me tighter and perhaps a little neuter but these are not far from the mark. love the dark denim. They are very flattering.
B00OM2P0IE|2|I ordered a youth 6/7 thinking it would be roomy for my 5 year old son who traditionally wears 5T in most major brands, the shirt was ridiculously small (too bad it's so cute!).  I matched it up exactly in size with a 4T Gap tshirt.  Extremely disappointed that it will not fit my son but at least I can save it for my daughter.
B00F4AW6HG|5|This is really soft and a beautiful vibrant color. My daughter loves the pockets and the hood. The tie is attached so it can't get lost.
B00K61CVDM|4|Great shirt.  I wear it more for the message since I had a newborn son.  The material is okay, but not as comfortable as other t-shirts I've worn.
B00NLNY3OM|5|Such comfortable, easy to wear pants...love them! I'm 5'3&#34; and 125 lbs, and the small fit perfectly. They have a hem so they can't be cut to fit, but that's OK because I can adjust the length at the waist to wear with either low or high wedges. Nice, flowy material that washes great, and I just hang them to dry to keep them looking good.
B00FJ4ROYC|5|It's. ah cool T shirt. I like it alot thanks Amazon&#34;.&#34;
B00K62V560|5|My girl is 5,3 and this fit her perfect. She really liked it which made me happy. She has worn it 3 times and its still going strong. No tear or rip. For the price it is a good buy.
B00CEPXD0I|5|Fit well... Nice looking shirt
B004UNZMVK|2|This product has a very limited use as the method of attaching it to your upper lip is inadequate and works only once or twice.  It was not expensive, but it was a waste of money.
B00E0IYG5I|3|They were not tight and baggy feeling. They are very warm though but I would recommended buying 1 to 2 sizes smaller then size
B00KYSGE9O|3|Super comfy for lounging around house or wearing while pregnant. Not for working out. Absolutely no support.
B00BXRMHIM|5|Got the dress on time and was very pleased with it . My daughter loved it , thank u
B00A17AAAC|3|Style is cute, and the fit of the skirt was good, ordered small and I normally wear a size 4.  I am disappointed in the shorts compression and the stated length.  The shorts will hold the tennis balls, it feels like they hold the balls just barely and sometimes they do fall out if you play aggressively.  I had this same skirt several years ago in a beautiful Jade color but ultimately gave them away because of the shorts.  Was hoping this has been corrected over the past few years but the shorts are still the same.<br /><br />Additionally, there is no clear statement of the length of this skirt although it is mentioned in the Q&A section and is INACCURATE.  It states size small is 14 inches in length.  It is 12 inches.  Sadly returning this skirt because it has a lot going for it but won't work for me for tennis.<br /><br />If you want a 12 inch skirt and are willing to do some modifications to the shorts, this is a beautiful tennis skirt.
B002NHE2DO|5|Spent several months and much money with the chiropractor for plantar fasciitis. Would feel better for a while but then come back. Tried custom orthotics, same issue.     One night with these silly socks and all PF pain was gone!  I have to wear them a few nights a week right now, but I wake up feeling great and it costs a lot less than an office visit.      Highly recommended.
B004OKFESK|5|one the best shirts i have seen!! i love the color! great gift for the dog lovers!! thank you !
B008P0EACQ|5|Very
B0018OHQSG|1|I got to wear jeans once . Seemed small when other levis of same style and size are loose . After 1 wash they are too tight and losing length . Ive wore the same size at the same weight for over 20 years . No substitute for trying on before you buy
B00VIU271Q|4|The quality seems very good. The color is vibrant, it is very comfortable and it stretch perfectly. The skinny pant is a perfect to wear during cold season because the fabric is thick and feels warm. It has a skinny pants look but have a comfort of a legging. However, the skinny pants emphasizes lower body fats when you wear it so better to use long top with it. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange of my honest review!
B00ADIQOK4|1|Key case broke apart with 48 hours. Gromets that held the key station to the case separated.
B002HJ377A|5|This shirt is the reason i don't complain about having to wear clothing. With this, i can love what i wear. Its a total chick magnet, and it fits the soul like a glove. So i am a little on the fat side...and i got a medium on accident... but when i put the shirt on, perfectly shining through the shirt was a 8 pack of abs...Girls were mistaking me for Taylor Laughtner left and right... Get this shirt... its hot.
B00PVL26XW|5|I loved it, but it was too small for me.
B00NI55D74|4|Beautiful color
B004J1M3LU|5|It was way sturdier and heavier than I expected so it is a very nice crown.
B00M78NB2M|5|Excellent hat/cap ,fits great and engraving/ monogram is quality work --- I recommend this cap !!
B00KGCULYW|5|Perfect size.  Cute color and the case feels sturdy
B003TL6K60|5|My favourite jacket.  So warm and the shearling is a delight to feel against your skin.  It's great down to zero celsius with layers and the neck straps make a scarf unnecessary.  I've wanted a bomber jacket for years and I'm so glad I saved up to get a good quality one like this.
B00AZNHZHS|4|Received my package in good shape as promised and the hat was exactly what I was expecting. Fur on it does a little shedding but nothing to be concerned over.
B00GU30MAO|5|I love my new jacket. This is so comfortable and fits just right and looks stylish. It does a decent job at keeping me warm and the leather is acceptional.
B0009MZW2A|5|These have to be the best in socks overall. Definitely worth the investment in your feet. These fit your feet like a warm hug.
B00FCFTJCI|5|I wear it all the time and I love it, I put all my hair up in it and pull it over my ears and it stays where I put it. Keeps me warm too.
B00EJCRLO8|4|nice gloves!
B00DSY5VLI|5|Newest fav cord shirt. This piece is a hardcore, rugged shirt. I use it for my camping and off-roading outings. The fit is a bit generous as it is intended to be a jack-shirt type of gear. I love it!
B00NI4A0M8|4|My daughter is 5'5 and 97 pounds. These are snug on her. But, they are very soft on the inside and the length is good.
B00W64ABIO|5|love it...
B0013F153W|1|This actually hurt my armpit and left red marks.  The thing is, I've ordered this bra before and my other ones don't do this. The cut and the material has changed!!!  That's unfortunate, because I used to love this bra, and just thought that it would be the same as my other ones.
B00L0IPIJE|5|If you don't have a booty you will with these jeans on love it
B004UUKRKO|1|Cheaply made and runs way too small!
B00MBVT7P0|1|Not worth the money!!! Broke 2nd time I used it.
B00DX6VJ4Y|5|Awesome nursing bra, gives shape AND support.
B00CFT0AP4|5|Getting compliments already!
B00I7QMMNM|5|I Love this Dress!!! The workmanship is amazing! The fit was perfect, fits true to size stated. I will buy again. Thank you!😊
B004VQ9CPI|4|I've got this pant, in this size, in 4 different colors now.  So versatile.  Dress 'em up.  Dress 'em casual.  SLIM fit is perfect....which is way different (and for this 33 year old) than &#34;skinny&#34; fit.  Casual, comfortable, practical, stylish pants for ADULTS, haha.
B00JUW0H3O|5|I love it! Great fit and quality material.
B00NQQFP1Y|5|yes they do go up OVER your knees... neat look and feel,<br />a new fashion flair
B008UA2VN6|5|This hoodie is great, soft and comfortable.  The sherpa lining is pretty awesome, although it does not line the sleeves, just the hood and body.  Too bad that only the 2XL was on sale for the cheap price since I usually wear a xl, but $14 for a Puma hoodie, even if it is a little baggy, is a great deal.  I like the full zipper for easy-on/easy-off.  I've been lounging around the house in it since I got it and it's been perfectly comfy and I've loved it.
B00CI143GQ|4|Very Good Product!<br /><br />Fit Size,<br />Match color,<br />Good quality,<br />I like this Sesame Street Boys Shirt<br />because with good special prices!
B00JGT2KB8|5|What more can I say about this beautiful dress that others have not said already.  This dress is FANTASTIC!!! I really love these vintage dresses from Lindy Bop.  I also think that their excellent service makes this company a keeper, it's great and the delivery is super fast especially all the way from England.  Thanks Lindy Bop for refining my closet.
B008MU49YS|5|Nice shirt, it is on the thin side, so great for hot weather.
B00774HCMG|5|Everything as advertised
B00P3O3TG0|5|Super quick shipping, quality product
B0080DL1UC|3|this pretty dress in the photo is not as pretty in real life. Also, it was too small for my breasts (im a E cup) and it made my arms look fat. i alway wear size 0 because i have a skinny waist. but this time, the dress just doesnt fit me.
B00251O6TS|5|Item as expected. Prompt shipping. Very pleased overall.
B00LJMV836|4|Arrived quicker than expected ( was scheduled to arrive the next month but arrived within two weeks).<br />Light weight very cute.  Washed well with no print deterioration.  Very cute shirt.
B00559OBQA|5|It fits great, looks just like the picture, and arrived within 3 days of purchasing. I ordered the XXL (I wear about a size 18-20 dress) and it fits perfect. I was worried the belt might be tight or uncomfortable if it was a stiff material, but it's made of cloth and has extra long ties so it definitely fits without a doubt, and it looks great. And the coins on the vest jingle!!!
B0074DMPCM|5|Muy buen producto, estoy muy contenta con lo que he recibido, excelente calidad y ha llegado muy rapido. Estoy satisfecha.
B0009JO8QE|5|Good quality. Nice material. Fits as expected. Would definitely buy more from this company. Great price.
B0017WO5L0|2|Not as soft as my old tee Shirt. Not the same quality. I will not buy these tee shirts again.
B00J2SRNBU|5|These are the only Jeans that fit me like a glove.  I wish I could get them in Grey and Black!
B00DM21DEU|4|I liked this.  The yellow is very bright, and washed out my fair haired daughter, but otherwise it is lovely.
B00KHTOP2S|4|The scarf is cute, silky and nice for what I needed it for.
B00JKG1P8G|3|Ok
B002NR1YG2|5|The colors are beautiful and do not run, except if you wash it. It is fitted and looks beautiful! The arm bands may be too large or small, but you can easily sew them to fit your arm. Overall, I love it!
B00CFQIS24|2|I am 5'1&#34; Fit as expected at first, but then it shrinks drastically!<br />Upon washing it in cold water, then drying it on cool setting it shrunk up at lease minimum 3 sizes. It went from mid thighs to my hip bone.  4&#34; to 5&#34; it shrunk in length, that is a bit too much to accept. The armpits and neck too shrunk so bad, that it was difficult to get on. I loved it so much, so very pretty, but I will be sending it back. Thanks to Amazon Prime!
B00NF2VI88|5|Item just as described.
B00TAV8FPM|5|AMAZING!!!
B00NMWXD48|5|As a large woman it is hard for me to find clothing that is both fashionable and affordable. I have found it on lafashionid. I love how this top fits, and how the material isn't stiff. And of course the back is to die for. I bought it in the grey, and now it's one of my favorite tops. Kuddo's lafashionid for your More 2 Love line. I certainly will be a return customer.
B009FSVS8G|5|This fit great on my daughter and it washes well. The only thing is that my daughter requires assistance with putting the dress on because of the buttons that go down the back, but I love it, and we will be adding a cardigan or a little jean jacket to the dress as the weather grows cooler. I can't wait to buy more!
B00368CLFU|5|i had  shock  absorbers before, they always  the  BEST!<br />perfect  for  running ,zumba and  horsbackriding!
B005RDX5BG|4|This bra is so comfortable and is the first that actually stays put on my shoulders. I was also thrilled to find a 34F or DDD, which apparently most bras aren't available in (I guess they think that our breasts do not grow when they fill with milk!) I do wish I could find a bra with a molded cup for this great a price, but I'll take what I can get.
B005G2DAO0|4|If your looking for a good money clip then buy this one. I used it several times and it worked like it says it does.
B00CKZWGY6|5|This is a great helmet, too big for my head because I'm a teenager. It is covered in oil When you take it out, Which is good for care.
B00C70SL3E|5|I purchased this and still wondering about the size because it says 2-7 yrs old.<br />Still, I purchased small size. My son is turning 6 yrs old and this is VERY BIG.<br />Feels like kids who are 7 or 8 yrs old might fit.
B000JHCZUC|5|This is the ONLY place we were able to find jeans that fit the boy ~ & he LOVES them!! Thank you!
B005M4DSK8|4|True to size, and it looks really nice! It doesn't seem like it would shrink (I've only washed it once though). It seems to be made of good quality but the shirt is a bit thin, which I like!
B001WAL2IG|2|The shirt was made of cheap fabric and it shrank after a couple of wash and dries.  Only got a few wears out of it.
B00I130RB0|3|Not as soft as I expected
B00AO6UKTG|1|Once the wig shipped it came in two days but that's the ONLY good thing about it. This wig looks NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING like it does in the picture, matter of fact I don't even think they sent me the same one. I got some gray looking mess with a nasty color mixed in & a few strands of one of the purples in the picture. When I took it out my sister said you got a gray wig? I didn't order a nasty gray wig! On top of that it was shedding as soon as I unwrapped it from its PLASTIC BAGGIE! Yup they shipped this mess in a box wrapped in a plastic baggie with the wig's info on a label. A plastic baggie...really?! Yeah it was soft & had a lot of hair but it was falling out, the wig was super heavy, & the color was disgusting. It looked SUPER fake too. The wig cap is not only not adjustable, but it's SO big it slid back almost falling when I put it on.  It didn't fit, it won't fit anyone unless you wear another wig underneath, & the color... I've been wearing wigs for fives years & this was by far he nastiest one.This product is falsely advertised, poorly stored, & damaged on arrival. I don't know what they sent me but this was NOT it. I returned this mess & will NEVER get anything form anyone selling it again b/c all their products are probably the same falsely advertised, in a baggie, & falling apart. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!1
B00S9WXAXA|5|I love them, nice quality, not too thick to make your feet sweat and not to thin to give off that cheap look, I will absolutely purchase more from the designer &#34;James Fiallo&#34;
B00GK6X8BG|5|Very plush and high quality. I would buy it again most definitely. Makes a great gift and they'll love you for giving it to them.
B00AKOYEUI|5|its so so so cute for my girl.anna so like it.But,so small for 1 years old.now anna 7M 7.8KG 69CM ...
B00BMN49KG|5|excelente
B0009MGYTU|4|Gave these as a gift.  Guess my brother in law liked. Good price.  I hope they lasted a while.
B003N63ETM|2|I bought these shorts for hot yoga.  These are tight shorts, obviously.  So when they roll up, I am willing to blame it on my power thighs.  If I had straighter legs, they might stay in place.  They do stay in place most of the time.  I think they'd probably be fine for a strenuous trip to the gym.  But after 60-90 minutes at 100+ degrees, they roll up a bit.  If that were my only problem with these shorts, I'd give them a 4.<br /><br />However, they get a two for poor fabrication.  They appear to be well made, with multiple thread lines along the seams.  However, at the crotch, they began to unravel after one wash.  I trimmed the thread and will keep my fingers crossed it doesn't get too much worse.
B003UO85DM|5|Perfect for my cosplay! Fits very well--it's just a tad bit big. Though, I wish that it wouldn't refer to this as a &#34;bra,&#34; since it provides no support whatsoever, and would definitely require a strapless bra underneath it.
B00MY7R7BW|5|SO COMFY
B00DIV62XW|4|I bought this for a superhero 5k and received many compliments..it was so much fun to wear and not bulky.  I highly recommend for this type of activity  or a costume just wear compression shorts underneath as it is not a modest length
B001FOR4SQ|5|The quality of the belt was really good.  I received the item in the specified time.  The sizing was on point for me.  I really liked everything about this item.
B007RBV3X8|5|100% se lo recomiendo, de muy buena calidad el producto, y muy feliz con la inversión realizada y muy buen precio.
B00WH2RJQ2|5|This is my 2nd time ordering this skort, the other one was so cute & comfy I had to get another color
B00DMQ39IO|5|I love everything that I have ordered.
B000U8EXPU|5|Arrived on time , and it looks even better in person . I love the feel and weight of pewter and have looked for a while to find something like this . Beautiful design :)
B00B77NARK|4|its cool.<br />just a shirt<br />the guy in the picture looks weird tho
B0048UDPLE|5|Excellent quality and wears well, although the pant legs are a bit long for me, probably just a function of having short legs.
B002DMTHEI|5|Buy.  Worth the low price.
B00CA6X54A|5|Purchased this dress for my 20 year old daughter. She is 5'4\\" and 113 lbs. i ordered a size small, It arrived promptly but was huge on her. Called right away to arrange for a return/exchange. UPS was there the very next day to pick it up and on the following day the XXS dress arrived. Right in time for her event. Couldn't be more pleased with the service and of course if my daughter is happy, life is good lol!
B002XAAD02|5|Great looking shirt! But it is on the large side. I wear mediums and larges. A lot of people said these run small. So i got the large just to be safe and i feel like im wearing an XL. But its okay im giving it to my friend and im ordering another but a medium this time.
B0101A8V04|5|This shirt is pretty great! I was worried it wouldn't fit, however, it fits perfectly, and without any issues at all.<br />It's super light weight material, and is very breathable!<br />I wore this as a boatneck for my wedding. I can wear it off one shoulder, however, I am a bigger girl, and my shoulders are too broad to be able to wear it off both shoulders as displayed. Someone much smaller than me would be able to.<br />The length on this is fantastic as well. It's not too short nor too long.<br />Overall it's a beautiful shirt and I recommend it! I will be purchasing other colors!<br />I received this at a discount for the purpose of an honest review. My opinion is my own and is not influenced in any way.
B00HH5V9TW|4|This runs big but I'm not unhappy, I really like this funky shirt, I'm tall and it fits good the back has holes cutout so it's even more fun to wear.
B000RN44BQ|5|I still love it! I just probably need to go up a cup size
B00BJOTQQ0|5|Great fit, fast service, would recommened
B00LAVYZ90|4|good
B007DJ2P04|5|A lot like the one I had in the early 80s.<br />Decent tshirt.<br />Iron Maiden Rules.
B00B2UZTV2|4|It is pretty and fits as expected.
B00G9APAW8|2|The buckle broke after 2 weeks!
B002JQ7KDI|5|I've been wearing Carharts for years. They are durable and long lasting. Local store doesn't always have my size,  not a problem when buying on Amazon.
B000QAS2SG|5|Love, love, love! Attractive and strong hardware. Good quality for the low price. I think I will buy several more to set aside for great gifts for guys and gals. Nice side zipper and hand grip on the end. Unisex item.
B00FQJG48C|5|I still have my Navy peacoat but no longer have my Navy issued watch cap. I bought two. They're great. The people at Army Universe are great. I dropped them a note and they promptly got back. I definitely recommend Army Universe (and the watch caps)!
B00F94NO32|5|I loved these pants and I feel great with them on. I purchased two of the same type. Never know when they will stop making them right?
B001JQLPGM|1|I did a lot of research before deciding on an underwire bra after years of not wearing an underwire and it did not pay off.  I have bruises on my breast bone between my breasts from the wires and my skin is rubbed raw in the same place.  I bought a 2 inch bigger size than I normally wear to be sure that it wouldn't be too tight but it didn't make any difference.  The cups are scratchy and the straps are not comfortable.  What a waste of money!!!
B003X26S5S|4|Makes husband happy.
B00K5T7O1E|5|Item as described.
B00RD4R3XS|5|Super cute and great shorts!
B00ATGZG6I|5|good wind protection
B00C6XQXBE|4|acceptable
B00GOK9QAK|5|This cap was received promptly and arrived exactly as described. The fabric and construction are of good quality. I think it will serve my husband for many years to come.
B00BFWFP5W|2|I really liked the look of this bra, which is mostly why I got it. I'm a 30E, and this bra was both tight in the band and small in the cups but in the weirdest way. The cup size probably has to do with how heavily padded this bra is, much like a heavily padded Victoria's Secret bra. For me, the padding decreased the overall cup size by about one, but because the cups go so high up, there was a large gap at the top of the cup that would only be filled if my breasts were ridiculously full.    Don't expect cleavage from this bra either. The gore goes very high on the chest and creates a lift and separate effect. It does create uncomfortable armpit cleavage, so beware of that.  Short anecdote: I ran out of clean bras the other day and decided to give this bra a try just for one day's wear. After 30 minutes I fully regretted my decision since I was so uncomfortable/tight/pinched and instead took joy in wearing an old ratty, yet comfortable, bra I was getting ready to retire.  Long story short, don't remove the tags until you've worn it a little while.
B00DXM229E|5|My wife is very happy with the way it fits. She is 5'4&#34;, and the length is perfect (a few inches from the ground) and the elastic waist is just snug enough, but not too tight as to be uncomfortable,
B00J0VCU26|5|Met specs
B001PU52YI|5|These yoga pants are constructed very well. I like the material but the small (which is usually my size in other brands) was too small. I want another pair but don't know which size to order.
B008QW7VF6|5|Comfortable, nice cotton, not too tight on the neck. Glad I bought a size large to be somewhat lose. Want more.
B00091UNX4|3|a bit baggier than I expected.  could be my physique, or just the jean cut.
B00ANQDW8S|5|Perfect fit and as advertised! Fast shipping too!
B000M4ZNUG|4|This was shipped fast and it looked nice but I got extra small and it was still too big on me. However the item looked nice and clean and maybe with a wash it will shrink to size.
B003V4ALCO|5|GOOD
B000H3G1XU|5|I ordered this black ski mask from Amazon, and it when it arrived, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />It was, in fact, a ski mask, and it was, in fact, black.<br /><br />Incredible.
B0064X6LT6|3|It was a nicely made dress.  Per all the reviews and recommendations I ordered a larger size than normal, but it was still too small.  This style of dress is not flattering to larger crested women, it has a tendency to flatten you out.
B00JVBDSUS|4|Great hat. Lightweight. Covers my face and chin. Flexible.
B00CQBMGYY|5|These are the cutest bow ties for my toddler. They are super adjustable to fit a baby through a toddler through a boy to even an adult.  And the colors are so much fun!
B007HJLU92|5|I'm highly satisfied with this  hoodie. I bought it for my daughter, and she wears it to school almost everyday. It's soft, comfy, warm and colors doesn't fade. True to size too.
B00K5LPAEA|5|I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. It arrived quickly and it is very warm as well as classy looking. I would most definitely recommend this one over the plain grey one which I bought for my son.
B000VV7Q00|1|Buyer beware--this shirt is cut extremely small. I wear a medium in every other kind of shirt (including a terrific Jerzees tagless, which I can't find anywhere now), so I ordered this brand based on other buyer reviews.    Big mistake. These shirts run extremely small and the tails are very short, so they already look like they've shrunk before you wear them the first time. The fabric is also fairly lightweight, so no doubt they don't hold up to many washings.     Based on my own experience, I can't recommend this shirt for anyone except very small teens. I've sent mine back for a refund.
B00K8LZOGQ|3|good quality. I ordered a 12 month size and washed it before taking it as a gift as my daughter has to use a laundry mat - Glad I did as it shrunk a little and was smaller sized to begin with - wearing it now and he is 5 months old. Long from head to toe. I'd say it fits like a 9 month size.
B00GZRMF5K|5|My Daughter and I love these light weight scarves.  They are very comfortable and fit nicely with a plain sweater. This scarf is well made.  Looks just as shown in picture.
B00UTWCCBE|5|Im 5'2 140 I ordered a large.These are great! Very comfy and fits perfect! I will be ordering all the colors!!!!
B004NWC4IW|5|We found these when our baby was 9 months old.  It looked like a good concept and I am so glad we bought them.  Since finding them, these are the only shoes we use for our child. They are easy to pull on and they stay on.  No more struggling with getting shoes on and tying laces etc only for the shoe to fall off later!  Plus, they are quite flexible, the sole is not hard which allows the baby to walk naturally.  Babies who are wearing those really flat soled shoes walk funny and it is because they have to adjust their gait since the shoe does not \\"give\\". I can't say enough about these shoes.  They are a decent price too when you see baby shoes priced at $50 or more!  So far we are on to size 2 year old and I wonder if the next bigger sizes will still be as comfortable when our baby's foot grows?  I have seen knock off designs of this sock shoe but they weren't as well designed, they were too narrow.  These are wide enough to accommodate our son's wide feet. I only wish that they would make a warmer material for the winter or something water-proof. We needed to find snow boots for our 1 year old and you wouldn't believe how difficult that was.<br /><br />The other reviewer mentioned that they shrunk.  I had no problems with that but I didn't dry them in the dryer either. Watch out with throwing them in the washing machine because the little spikes on the bottom could pull the fabric of the other shoe.
B00K5ZIH6Y|5|just perfect for around the house and for sleeping!
B00EWASFQA|4|I have been wanting a cute high-waisted swimsuit for the LONGEST time and it never occurred to me to look on Amazon for an affordable one and I'm so glad that I did! I got the classic black and white stripes/polka dots with a red accent and it looks absolutely great! It's the same quality as any other bathing suit I own and it gets me compliments everywhere I go.<br /><br />Pros: cute, fits well, good quality, adjustable (with or without straps)<br />Cons: shipping takes about 3 weeks to arrive, the buttons were slightly loose (not the end of the world), and even though it worked out in my favor, I actually received two different sizes (a large top and medium bottom) so hopefully that won't happen to you.<br /><br />I would recommend this suit to anyone looking to wear this style, just order in advanced!
B008CE653M|4|It was missing a button on the sleeve. No it didn't fall off, it just wasn't there, not even any thread. But it's cool. I had an extra, and learned how to sew it on. Thanks though, it's a nice fit.
B000L6EZRC|5|I have received multiple comments on this coat. I love it. It fits but also gives me room to wear more layers if I feel the need to.
B000M13B3A|1|I purchased a bag from this vendor, thinking that by being affiliated with Amazon that they were legit. <br />I got the bag and thought it looked fake.  The vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique. <br />The boutique confirmed that it was NOT authentic, so I am returning the bag I got from Moda Party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney, unauthentic bag.
B00CZ7TZBG|5|I love this bra! It is so comfortable! No wires and I still have support.
B00377WSDU|3|Although I followed the sizing guide, the fit is larger than expected. This means that there is no shaping help to be had.
B00LCS081A|3|I purchased two different styles of Hanes briefs and these were a little tighter than the classics, same size but the classics fit perfect.
B004R7YSTG|5|Shirt fits as expected and graphic holds well under washes. The detail in the graphic is done well and characters are clearly distinguishable.
B002C8CB9G|4|I'm cute
B00GV2JGQK|3|To me, natural fit is to your belly button. These go quite a bit above. While I can sometimes stand natural fit with the right shirt, I cannot stand when they reach my ribs. If mom jeans are your things, you'll love these.<br /><br />Very nice fabric, adorable print, longer inseam without being Bermuda. I really wish these would have been a lower rise.
B0072DESOM|3|i had a perry ellis wallet before, but in that one the leather felt soft and expensive..<br />In this one the leather feels hard and cheap and fake.. but its a good wallet
B00EF6LTR8|5|I love, love love this hat.  It looks much better in person and it is the weight is substantial and not a lite as I assumed it would be.  I plan to order another!
B00D8403AC|2|Based on my personal preferences, this was a bit too sheer for my liking so I returned.
B00FOSEULI|5|Perfection!  great fit!  just ordered two more sets !
B00L3EU9AI|5|After reading the reviews I decided to add this coat to my Christmas wish list. I'm short and curvy, (44-32-44) and the XL was perfect. I usually have to struggle to get anything that fits in the bust but isn't way too huge in the middle. The sleeves are a little long for me but I'm ok with that. They were the perfect length on an office mate who is 6' so if you are tall with long arms this will fit. The red is a true, deep red and just bright enough to stand out without being garish. It's a very soft feel with good weight to it and I was worried the wool content would make it itchy but not at all. So far, I love it. Warm without being too heavy and great for layers as it give plenty of room in the sleeves. I'll update as to durability once I have had it a while.
B008D3COB4|5|I got this as a gift for my nephew and will be giving it to him soon. It's a very cute set and I loved the price and that it came with socks.
B000TNDGXQ|5|I just received this dress today, and I am very impressed!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered my dress two sizes larger than I would normally wear, and it fits perfectly.  The fabric has a little stretch to it, just enough to make the fit very flattering.  I bought it for a formal dinner for a cruise I am taking next month, and I will definitely be ordering from Pacificplex again.  5 stars all the way!
B00JLB5BFI|5|Beautiful. Great for casual or dressy.
B00IAUYKUI|4|Super cute, lighter weight little jacket. Perhaps runs a wee bit on the tight size. From what I've seen in baby sizes, 12-18 month and 18 month are used interchangeably. Surprised more people don't seem to realize this!
B009T3Q5EY|5|Very happy with these shorts, I love the fit. I was worried the color would be too bright but it's more subtle than pictured and wears well with a white tank top.
B006FKPHKC|5|These r awesome. They are so stretchy it is never too tight.  Sooo much better than a typical sports bra!
B00NB6NEDU|5|Will buy again, I can see my boys wanting more.
B008ARIW6O|4|Good product and it fits well.
B00CVS9B7W|4|Nice fabric. Fits well. Wish it was a little bit longer but very nice cover up.
B00HVWFBB8|5|this is so adorable...and flattering. just enough coverage, but doesn't feel weighted down by excessive material! perfectly matches any tankini top!
B00DH9HULI|4|The quality of the jacket was much more than I expected.  Very well constructed.  Even the buttons were handsome. Unfortunately, the size I ordered was too small.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good looking blazer for a young to teenage boy.
B007JX7OHI|1|Too small and looks cheap
B006PI0IUI|4|This is a very nice-looking wallet/card holder. In addition to the good looks, it fits nicely into my front pocket and isn't so bulgy as to completely destroy the line of my shorts or pants.<br /><br />The interior is divided into a number of pockets, just the right size for holding credit, debit, gift or ID cards. If you carry cash, though, you've got to do a little maneuvering to fit it in there, but it's not that difficult.<br /><br />I purchased this card holder not for the looks, though, but for the expectation that it would block RFID signals. These Radio-Frequency IDentification protocols allow readers to get the information stored on your credit/debit cards. Which is great when you're actually trying to pay for something. Not so great when you're standing next to someone with a rogue RFID reader who scoops up your information and then goes on a charging spree.<br /><br />The SHARKK wallet is designed to block RFID signals, making your cards safe from being surreptitiously captured. I've not managed to test it, but, should that feature do as well as the design and looks of it, I think we've got a winner here.
B00E2SVIKM|3|I picked this one bc my husband liked this one over the other 4 I had chosen. I love the color, it makes my tan glow. I love the fun island pattern, will go great on our cruise. I got a XL and it fits pretty snug. I usually wear L in womens shirts. But I do like the lining, its like a smoother, not as tight as a girdle but enough support to keep your tummy sucked in. I don't like that the smoother wasnt sewn to the top layer though. I hope when I swim in it the top layer doesn't rise from the bottom layer. Kinda dumb they didn't sew it together. I might have someone sew it. I have no boobs, so they fit good in this top and the top makes me look like I actually have something. Was the top worth $90, I don't think so. I feel the quality is not worth $90.
B005JX3T5G|5|They are great
B001659O78|3|These bra straps are pretty adorable, and look like they'll hold up. Unfortunately, after a short period of regular wear, they snapped! I was pretty bummed, because they were comfy and I liked the appearance.
B005GV446Y|4|I've been wearing this belt for almost 5 months everyday and it's showing very little signs of wear.  some of the other reviews of different belts were saying that after wearing for one month lesser quality belts were falling apart.  not true for this beast.  my only complaint is that it doesn't slide through the belt holes very smoothly and has to be constantly fed through as opposed to pulled like other belts i've owned. really not a big deal though and is improving a bit from when it was new.  I'd definitely recommend this belt!
B00M5943XY|5|Love this hoodie!  So comfortable and got here quick!
B00KL3Y3S6|4|We picked this up for a “nerd” bow tie party and it served the job – hitching up the suspenders worked fine and the bow tie matched and complimented the outfit.  If you’re looking for a suspender / bow tie kit for a party I would recommend this one; if you’re looking for something for everyday use, I would recommend something else.  Then again, for pricing less than $9 here on Amazon this served its purpose with flying colors!
B008Y0RU7O|4|I like it
B002LN0D5Q|4|Good for the money!
B00IOSBHZM|5|So soft and comfortable!  Fits great!
B00K3165EQ|3|I have to wear this as a top.
B00ZN6F65A|5|LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED .... HAVE I SAID THAT I LOVED IT!?
B0083H3QSK|5|Good quality material, well made, fit well -- just an all around good product.  I would buy again and probably will soon.
B00R92H906|4|looks just like advertised!
B0025UX460|2|I ordered a pair of Blue collar 514 and the black ones, both the same size.  The black ones were smaller and were not black but looked like new dark blue jeans.
B009T3MF48|5|My 5 year old son just loves Sonic , wish I could get more things in his size .... he loves the shirt and wears it so proudly !
B00NV6FA32|3|The pants and top is two different colors
B007S4QOV0|5|I bought these for myself , LOVED them so bought them as a gift as well!
B005ZLNU9W|4|I bought this just before giving birth to my first baby so I would have something besides a hospital gown to wear. I wore it in the hospital and once we were home. It was comfortable, warm, and good for nursing.
B00M55028S|3|Nice color and nicely made but the skirt was too tight for me.
B00AEDIRTY|5|I ordered it on Feb 06 and received it on Feb 09. Very fast shipping. The winter jacket was awesome, made with quality materials and it has a nice color combination. It perfectly fits my son who is six year old, I got the size 5-6. I was happy that the sleeves length was just perfect. Not too long for him.
B00MUKK2VK|2|The design was misleading. When you wear this jacket, the arms are completely gray. Very ugly. Also, I wear a large and ordered an extra large and that just barely fit, so beware of that too.
B00LX60UVE|3|Do not have my size..
B00IQD4PKE|4|First off, Shipped by next day... Excellent! 5 stars.  Slightly big in the waist (for me) 4 star.  I THOUGHT is was a full suit... (my bad) 4 star.<br />The jacket was very crisp, I need to press in before use 4 star.  There! I am happy with it overall. will buy from customer again in the future
B00LGSIBBU|2|It's not big, not as absorbent as I wish. Will not get it.
B00DETJ9RE|4|These are a little tighter on me than they should be - so they don't look well - will always wear a very long blouse, shirt or sweater with them.  A bit too expensive - can get these same type of leggings for half of what these cost.  Because of the higher price I expected something a bit nicer with a better fit.
B006W9SVWM|5|I was looking all over for a doctor who shirt and I came across this one. The image on the shirt is AWESOME and it's true to the size.  One of my best buys on Amazon.
B00P20DZ9G|5|Nice and long which is hard for me to find. I look a lot like the models and most clothing really doesn't fit me all that well. So happy to have found Patty Boutik. I own 10+/- Patty shirts and have only had one Patty shirt that I didn't like which I returned.
B00CP6S8Q0|3|They are much taller (like top to bottom) then I expected them to be.  Even in my size they tend to slide down, I wish the elastic was stronger.
B00D6G7VUC|5|I love it!!
B004JQZBGY|5|Great shorts, fits well and I liked the design.
B00SUNZNEW|4|I bought the CWOJA0141-KHAKI small - I normally wear a xs/s, and this jacket is a little loose - I thought it would be more figure flattering like the picture. It's definitely a light weight jacket - great for spring and early fall. It's lined and the stitching seems well done. I'm happy with my purchase. :-)
B0033NU326|5|I waited for the price to go down some before I ordered this top because I did not want to pay almost $30 just for the top. But I am 5'8 135lbs normally wear a S and M in tops (34DD bust size) and I ordered the small just because I don't like my scrubs all loose and baggy on me and the small fit great! It is a little snug on the armpit area but not uncomfortable at all. If you have large arms I would order a size up. The material is good quality and there are \\"baby phat\\" logos around the top keep in mind, you can't see that in the photo. I could have done without that -__-. Great buy I would recommend!
B00J6SJV70|1|Cute and comfy but poorly made. Literally as soon as I put it on one of the straps flung back, it came detached from the front. I sew it and literally, the minute I put it on, the other strap snapped. I sew that strap back on and figured.. look at the two that haven't come detached yet so you can sew them if needed while I had the thread out. I look and they're both only held together with four stitches. In the end I had to sew the straps on front and back.<br />Size M is accurate.
B00KC9H55M|1|This dress is cheaply made. My daughter wore it for less than 5 minutes before the tulle ripped. I was able to fix that piece, but the next day it ripped again! I ended up tearing all of the tulle off.
B00JEJQUCK|5|Hubby wanted some soft, comfortable and yet fun boxers to lounge around in. Done deal. Will be looking for more. Fast shipping and arrived in great condition.
B003EEMBD8|4|Got this for my sons Halloween costume they were a little on the small side he was only 12 months old & I had to get him an 18 month so they fit.
B00AF4CN7O|1|Fit terribly, very cheaply made, thong non existant
B006O8A4F8|5|It keeps you warm, eventhough, sleeves allow you to move, you can remove the fur, in case you´re allergic or you don´t want to wear it. Only the belt, although elegant, opens easily.
B00IRWC236|5|Smell is strong but quickly goes away. I love this!
B00D3V2ICG|5|I NEVER do reviews... But I'm always that person checking them! Lol so this is my first time buying on Amazon and I found these for my bestie wedding in August. I ordered yesterday and it arrived this morning! Anyhow I'm 5'3 155lbs and my bra size is NOW a 34DD (just had my first baby 3months ago) #BreastfeedingIsAwesome so I ordered a 10 to be on the safe side and it fit perfectly!! The Bust, length, fit it great! Hope this was helpful for you :)
B008KPPSZE|5|Ordered my hat in Khaki color. Love it!
B00840RSJ4|5|I bought this with hesitation because the sizing was for 9 - 12 months. At 22 pounds and almost 30 inches it fit her fine.  It's hard to find anything &#34;first christmas&#34; larger than 12 months, but with my daughter having been born in January I risked it.  Very soft cotton and even after washing it she was able to wear it a few times before she truly outgrew it.
B001FF9B1S|4|This is a versatile and comfortable skirt. It fits well and would get a 5 star, except the inner shorts are so stretchy, the tennis ball sometimes falls out. Nice color that goes with several of my tennis tops!
B007FCF4OI|5|fix perfect and i love it
B004FYY4VS|5|I love these pants... I am tall and have trouble finding pants that are long enough. They are comfortable and great to work in...
B008C5MQ7U|5|It arrived just in time for the birth of his 3 Grand Child...just day's before.  He is thrilled with the gift.
B001CCQX38|5|Excellent product; however, zipper is made from the left side, as though we were in a foreign country (or maybe that's the woman's style).  In general the zipper is too fragile for a sweater of this type; but the overall product is excellent and very well priced.
B00BR9W8JO|5|Secure pin an locks them in place very well
B00H69OTIM|5|Nice and thick<br />These are not the flimsy ones<br />Excellent quality
B0095C144U|3|First noticed when I cut the tag off it left a hole in the brim.  Fun hat but only costume quality.
B002EC3UE0|1|I received the costume on time but the quality was horrible.  There were several holes/rips and the costume itseslf was just cheap!
B007GB5W3Q|4|I like the quality! It's soft for my child. Did not wash yet but I expect it to be in good condition. Length is good but I feel it's slim. Since it is from safety point of view better to have tight rather than wide (not to catch fire) accepted.<br />Thanks
B002V72BM0|5|I suffer from cold calves due to neuropathy. Nothing seems to really conquer the cold, but I have found these leggings to \\"hang in there\\" and stay in place without causing any circulation restrictions. I can't dance anymore and these would look kinda dumb if I wore them on the outside of my pants, but I am old enough to not care.
B00E3VIR9S|1|The collar has a large area with a ball of stitching. This is a main focal point of the shirt and makes it unwearable. Can't return the shirt since I ordered it just before vacation. Just money out the window!
B000VZKCU2|5|Love it but very skin tight. Great for winter times.
B000F4XJDQ|5|Comfy, sturdy, and hold their color well through multiple washes.  Sizes may be a little on the large size - I bought a large and am swimming in it.  The drawstrings do help with that issue.  I'd highly recommend them as sleeping shorts, and will definitely buy another pair should my first pair ever wear out.
B00LLIVQNU|2|Did not like it
B00OXN6UBS|3|They are very small but seem to be well made and are very soft.
B00G1N6NW4|4|Affordable cute leotard.
B001AQM5W4|5|Its a good cape for what I paid. I bought it to go with a Darth Maul costume and it turned out great.
B0018OMIMK|1|My husband has worn 505 jeans for his whole life but that is about to change. I bought him 3 pairs, removed the tags, he wore them and we noticed there was a big gap at the waist, on the back-side. We discovered Levis has removed 2 loops \\"in a cust-cutting move\\". Well, their cost-cutting has lost this customer. It is SO annoying! Levis, wake up and put the loops back or you've lost this customer for good.
B00MGJAWVK|1|Sucks its way small and i got a 6x when in normally a large in womens -.- did not like it its a waste of money
B00GYTHHS4|1|Should've checke, too small but a nice print
B007T5M6H4|5|SEXY!!!!
B007FP3GG8|5|Looks Beautiful
B008MJI77Y|5|In a world filled with designer clothing lines that offer a rock star look with nothing but massive overkills of tribal twirls, engorged fleur-de-flys and classless menacing skulls, leave it to Robert Graham to know exactly how to incorporate an edge with sophistocation and style! The \\"Tyrion\\" sport shirt is a limited edition of only 770 units (which includes all sizes) which has a very soft feel and features an all-over print of little crowned skulls on a ground of rich grayish blue. The shirt goes on to add solid matte black three-dimensional skull buttons on the front placket and cuffs and an apexing collar button which is oversized and has an artistic gypsy moon face design. A decadent dark purple crushed velvet is found on the interior of the collar and each cuff, where it is also adorned with glorious embroidered silver coronets. Slices of diagonally striped green and black fabric trimming the entire inner part of the bottom hem and each gaunlet provide a subtle and unique contrast, as does the large half-chevron stitched in crimson thread found centered on the shirt's back yoke. I'm so thankful we live in a world with Robert Graham shirts! They make every day and absolutely any occasion a celebration to be alive and feel great about who you are :-)
B001FB521A|5|great bra
B0068IO2VG|5|use them for work. as an electrician they are comfy. baggy in the right spots, which is practical in winter(long johns/thermal underwear) back pockets dont rip as easy, as opposed to other brands. my smartphone with otterbox fits snug on side pocket and also fits in front pocket with my xl hands these are for work thats why i have 8 pairs of them. try em on at sears first to make sure the fit is good. average about 40 bucks a pair. so use your discounts when you can
B004ARZKJA|5|Strange how hard it was to find men's handkerchiefs in department stores where we live. So ordered these through Amazon and this brand was exactly what quality we were wanting. They wash up nicely, cloth is very strong but soft. Could not be happier.
B00PER7X9K|4|Was smaller than expected but I still give 4 stars for their customer service.
B00EV88P54|1|I didnt That The tie is small and for boy.<br />I can not use the product
B00LIYCWLM|5|So pretty…I want one in every color! Fits perfect!
B004EHNX8G|5|I saw this adorable UGG Bucket hat on display at the mall and it was the last one for sale. I didn't want one that everyone had tried on so I went online to my trusty AMAZON and bought it there. It looks so cute and perfect with my new black UGG high boots!
B00XLVMEJA|4|For this price, although the prints doesn't look to be made with a good material, it didn't bleed after wash.  And it looks really pretty.
B003IXVFLO|5|Works great for my skinny little guy!
B008XCNUKY|4|I like the looks and feel of my new gloves.  The lining is a bit thin but I think it is nice and warm and good looking
B00Y271GAK|5|Super kawaii<br />:)
B006O60WVG|4|My daughter said wheb she first tried it on that the dress is a bit itchy and pinches under the arms... when I turned it insideout I found a few of the sequins got sewed in to the inside... once I remloved them the dress was fine
B0009KKQKA|5|This christianity dress is beautiful and it's very cheap. You will not find one like it anywhere!
B007X4CYN2|3|Sweater is just ok.  Nice enough looking but not as thick as I would have liked.  Bought for my mother who is in assisted living and would have preferred something a little warmer.
B0013FHN3S|1|Smelled of mildew
B00FAXKFJ8|4|a little large but very comfy
B000CEB3OG|5|French cuffs aren't for everyone, but if you want a little formal style, this is a very nice shirt.
B003IF61O8|2|The material doesn't seem like fleece.  It seems like a cross between cotton and polyester (maybe that's what fleece is like) - in any case, it's not high quality fleece and the build is for a short, fat toddler. Too big around my son's waste now (and he is not thin - he's solid), and by the time they fit properly, they will probably be too short on him.
B009WC2FEQ|5|My daughter wore this a flower girl dress and it was PERFECT!  She will also wear it for Christmas with some Red jewelry. Great material great price!
B0064IPUC0|5|excellent product
B00JI7V820|5|Great Socks
B00LGZF724|5|great value and fast shipping
B00MHHYAW8|5|Took awhile to show up, but for the price, worth the wait. A little big on my 10 month old, but there is room to grow into it. So far I like it -- it looks really cute on my daughter. I haven't tried washing it yet so not sure how durable it is.
B001H0F3TK|5|Very comfortable and fairly light for a long athletic short. Shipped quickly and was exactly as described. Very happy. Kudos.
B001SGL0DG|5|this was just what I was looking for and the fit is great.  I had to return a different one which prooved too small, and there was no problem.
B00AEDRV0K|5|Thes3 are nice looking links.  Good price.
B00I2U1UW2|1|I GOT AN EXTRA SMALL BUT IT FOT LIKE AN EXTRA LARGE! IT IS HUGE!!!! DO NOT GET IT!!! NOT GOOD MATERIAL!!!!
B00FFC1OSK|5|I purchased a cheaper leather case for half the cost and it was half the quality of this case.  The leather on this case is quality, feels good to the touch but most importantly for an eye glass case is that the interior is lined and you don't have to worry about the lenses of your glasses getting scratched. I also like the magnetic button closure.  I don't like snap closures as you have to apply pressure to close them and no one wants to do that with expensive prescription glasses.  Velcro closures are a hassle and inevitably peel off.  Zippered cases are way too much hassle.  My glasses slide in and out of this case very easily.  The interior is very soft and the magnetic closure takes care of itself.  I like that the style is classic and not trendy, construction and stitching are nice and this style can be used by men or women. You'll find cases a lot cheaper but this one really is worth the price.  I can see it'll last a lifetime. My only complaint is that not all the colors are available anymore and if anything, they should put out more colors.
B0091CSP96|5|bad  quality, wrong size i follow the chart, look ugly, totally different what it shows in pic, don't waist your MONEY
B00075ZWVA|3|Get a size bigger than you need, cause these shirts shrink right out of the washer.  Will not purchase again.
B00FMMV906|4|It is relatively short to my taste, but it does not look bad either. I liked my American Eagle swimming short better, but it has been discontinued. So far it is the only affordable option that does not look bad on me and is comfortable. I prefer it to my Hurley and Rip Curl board shorts which are exaggeratedly long.
B00528CT4A|4|This slip is excellent quality, but I must admit that I was slightly disappointed with the fit. I ordered a size 6 for my six-year-old daughter and the slip was a lot smaller than what I was expecting. Although my daughter wears a size 6 in other clothing, it may have been better to order the slip in a size 10 and cinch the waist if needed to get the fit pictured. The slip we received Is more body hugging than free-flowing. It will work for now, but it would have been nicer to have one that could be of use for a longer period of time. If I had thought it through better, I would have remembered that most slips have a straighter cut and are less A-line.
B002QIK1BC|5|I was reluctant at first to buy a tie from Amazon, but I went ahead and bought it anyways. I must say, I don't regret it! For $11, the tie and material are way better than expected. This tie is very very similar to my more expensive ties, Calvin Klein, Donald Trump, Gucci. The material is very soft and the tie is just as shown in the picture.<br />Pros:<br />Arrived earlier than expected.<br />Great material.<br />Material is 100% silk.<br />For $11, this is way too good.<br />The color and pattern is just as shown in the photos.<br />Came neatly folded in a Y&G gift box.<br />Tie was clean.<br /><br />Cons:<br />There is no cons. Well worth the buy.
B001AHDYB4|4|I bought this shirt at kohl's, its really cute and, im not sure if this one dose but, mine has wings on the back. its pretty cute but i think it kinnda looks like tinkerbells smoking so my friends and i call it the tinkerbell crack whore shirt.
B00APYBCP8|5|I saw this in a major department store but they didn't have my size.  So I searched and found it on Amazon for less money.  It is so much better than the picture.  I love the material and the fit is very flattering.  I just think it runs a little small.  I've had other London Times dresses that run large and I size down 2 sizes.  I ordered my size on this and it was a little snug.  This dress is worth the money and I love it.
B009IUGQVA|5|These are sooooooo cute and nice! I just love them. They look very sweet, and rather warm. I can't test them in very cold climate, but I think that they will be good for warm climate winters or warmer mid seasons in colder places. I personally use them in the office, cause our AC is evil, and my hands freeze constantly. With these gloves I am safe!
B005Q6E644|5|Product was as described and arrived early - in time for Christmas! This provider deserves the most excellent marks for their quick service.
B00EUYJPSU|5|Absolutely love them!
B00WDHYY0K|2|This dress is gorgeous, but I ordered a small and it is GIGANTIC. Very disappointed.
B00I0QFZOC|5|Love love love
B00LKW2S3E|5|loveeee
B000MP1F2A|5|all is good
B00092ZT82|5|This is a good quality product and I would definately recommend it! I was surprised and how lovely it was considering the cost! Good buy!
B00944F1ZM|4|Don't have to wear a bra.  I wish it were seamless...the seam bothers me.
B00NB8JL6M|5|Fit perfectly for my daughter and came exactly as advertised. Thank you!
B00A8EPJA4|5|Great shorts, just as pictured and fit perfectly.
B00IIF73AE|5|Love this top, ok for me. 32 rib but D cup and 188 lbs, the small fit, but as. I have I think small ribs or the straight cut, the small fixture perfect almost boxy..got the extra small as love it so an one left..that is a spot on fit, but really a toss up, you will love it, all season stand alone summer or with a moto jacket and boots! Buy it!
B00N21DH5Y|5|Cute snuggie and great price
B00R4003HE|2|(This is my husband's account name, but my review). I bought these in a size 8p based on the sizing info in the product description. I took my measurements: with a 37in hip and 28in waist, they should have been a comfortable fit. They're still at least one size too small.
B00DTIMN00|2|My husband purchased me an XXL, since I usually wear an XL, just to be on the safe side... Well, its basically the size of a MEDIUM, if that.... I can't wear it, but I love the thought my husband had...
B00H3G0MJS|5|love 'em. only wish i had sized down as the material is very stretchy and while nice and fitted when you first put them on, they do stretch out very quickly.(not so much at the knees as the waist/hip/thigh area). fault is entirely mine - wasn't sure about the stretch fabric content so played it safe and went up a size.
B00GXDMPW4|5|This works great and is a wonderful bathing suit for little kids. I am happy about this don't hesitate to buy this
B0065Q5WFG|3|This bra is very comfortable but does seem to be a little large but I think the medium would be too small, but may try one in the future.
B000NOQG4C|5|good item thanks, you are good seller
B0013F150K|4|Very pretty bra.  I really like it but I like their other styles just a little bit better.  Great color.
B004U7X51A|5|got this for my cousin and he was very happy with how it fit and the color was just as red as in the picture
B00I042CKE|4|I'm happy I got this.  I like the pencil shape and the fabric is pretty good given the reasonable price.  I'm also really happy that I sized up based on a suggestion from another reviewer (I'm a pre-preg 10 and got a 12 in this).  When it arrived I noticed that the pricetag listed a price in pounds instead of dollars and had a UK website.  So my guess is this is a UK 12 which is usually equivalent to a US 8.  I do like the fit for now so I'm keeping it, although I'm not sure how much stretch it'll have for further down the road in my pregnancy (currently 19 weeks).
B00B3QMET0|5|I'm a 34D, sometimes a C depending on when I cut weight to fight. This bra supports throughout my weight roller coaster. I can run, do muay thai kickboxing, and the straps are detachable in the back so you can cross them and rehook them if you need it tighter. Great bra for cheap.
B004WPHWF0|4|Nicely done for an inexpensive costume.  Just be aware that it runs very small.  Typically I wear an 8/10.  I just returned the Large 10/12 and ordered the XL 12/14. - hopefully that will fit a bit better.
B00OH0555O|5|Love love love
B000UK1R6Q|5|This has become my standard T-shirt.  There may be better, I haven't tried them all, but these sure do the job for me.
B00DKN4PNW|4|I've only tried it on so far and I love it. I was a little worried about the sizing, but it fits just about perfect. I'm 6'1&#34; and around 195 lbs, I measured my waist and it came out about 35&#34; so I ended up with the S/M. It sits a little higher on my waist than I usually wear shorts/jeans, but I suppose I'll get over it. It's how kilts are &#34;supposed&#34; to be worn. The sizing mentioned something about letting the kilt sag to be worn lower on the hips, but with how it's made I'm not sure that would work out well.<br /><br />I am looking forward to wearing it out for the first time. The weekend can't get here fast enough.
B00DQW57JS|5|Fits just great - very fast service and good quality - thanks
B007KFZFO4|5|I have always had an issue finding a sports bra that fits. This bra keeps my boobs in place and gives me the support that I need! The price was not bad! Will definitely purchase another!
B00EF42EO2|5|Great product. Awesome gift for my father on his 80th birthday!
B00MBGC3TM|5|This sweater was just warm enough to wear inside, while not being too hot. I loved the Santa embroidery on the front, and it was so soft! The puff ball was absolutely adorable. I'm glad I took a chance and ordered this for Christmas.
B00HQ8ZVQ2|3|They feel nice however as other reviewers have stated, if you are large down there they will be a little snug.
B003OM30LC|3|I listened to the reviews and bought 2 sizes up and it does fit perfectly however I have two issues with this top. First it is more like a beach cover-up, the v-neck comes almost to my navel and I'm 5'8&#34;!  A cami under is a must. Second I bought this in black but the color looks sort of faded. Let me also say I still have no idea what the design on it is supposed to be. I'm keeping it but it is not as expected.
B00A8EFTKE|5|I was in need of Hawiian themed clothes for a business party. As this party was held in Fall and most stores had stopped selling their summer wear and I was forced to shop online. As far as swimwear I am very apprehensive with buying without seeing given that most swimwear runs small for me. These shorts we a great wear and extremely comfortable. They fit better than expected and are high quality. I was fooled a bit because in low light the shorts look dark brown but in bright lighting it is black. This was definitely a great buy.
B00CB8OEME|5|They are purple and black with a rainbow-pooping Unicorn...C'mon
B00K5ZRUDK|5|Just a fantastic shirt.  Quick shipping. High quality and great product.
B00CJJUQVS|5|T-shirt quality is better than average; has held up to numerous washes and the material still feels strong and thick. The design has held up fairly well, too. The shirt was a bit tighter fit than others of the same size.
B00DY1EW6A|1|The tights themselves are fine. However, was upset that I only received one pair of tights. Not three pairs like it stated.
B00EOM5EPQ|4|The strangest thing. I ordered a few of the same model 514 jeans, same size, but in different colors.  For whatever reason, the VIP model was about an inch longer than the other two. I exchanged thinking it may have been a quality control issue on that one pair, but the next VIP pair had the same issue. I suppose it could just be an issue with a batch of them.  Other than this, I do like the 514 model.  Nice look and pretty comfortable; not too slim, not too baggy.
B004IWP5TM|4|I ordered this dress for my sorority recruitment, which meant that it had to be a very specific color red so the most important thing to me was that color in person is very true to what is pictured. I am typically XS/S and ordered an S and the dress fits pretty well. The material is a bit stretchy so it will give a little which in my opinion is great just in case you miss a day of work or or something. I was concerned about the front ruching/pleating near the stomach because it doesn't quite flatter the model but the dress is actually not that pleated so it doesn't look like your dress is bunching up in the wrong places. I'm pretty short (5'2'') and I was satisfied with the length, not short at all but not too long either. The only issue with this dress that I have is the straps. I am fairly small chested so the straps are a bit long and tend to fall down. I guess they did that for more \\"bustier\\" women like the model. But it was nothing that a needle and some thread couldn't fix. So if you have a bigger chest, no fear, this dress will fit because again its got a bit of give to it. Overall, great dress for an unbeatable price!!
B0093DPE9C|5|I was a little skeptical when purchasing this item because of all the knock-off merchandise that surrounds a successful franchise.  That said, this hat is amazingly cute on my girlfriend..err companion, and has a wonderful appearance.  The technical stuff: the hat is made of quality material from Bangalar IV and is meticulously sewn together in Cybermen knitting camps on Terestria VII  . The tassels also add to the overall presentation and are sturdily attached. The little ball on top does not make a 'dinging' sound no matter how many times I bop it, and is most likely firmly attached to the rest of the cap. She wears it all the time now...Like, all the time.  I can't say that I have a problem with that as we are both die hard fans of the show which is totally not real, just cool.
B00AEVIZB6|1|This swim suit is extremely small for the sizes.  I ordered a 14 and it looks like an 8.  The material is very thin.  Thinking about returning it.
B00M1KCK28|5|Bought this for a friend but i'm sure she love's it.
B009VZR96S|4|They fit well but stretch out very quickly, unforgivingly.
B00AFQFHF2|5|They were great. It was just i was thought. Excellent purchase!
B00PN4HCGS|4|Super cute
B00COUSKRO|5|Loved my hat was what I expected
B005Z6HEVC|5|A good choice of colors. These are a thinner weight sock, but perfect for dress shoes. These are also an alternative for those die hard flip flop folks who are transitioning into colder weather. No bulging corners or sloppy fit. Quality seems like they will last.
B00FG3GCQM|5|My 4 year old loves dogs.  She wears these all the time, they are very soft and only get softer with each wash. The colors remain vibrant.  I asked her if she thought the applique was scratchy and she said it wasn't at all, so this was not an issue for us.
B004WI2EPU|4|Great fit, very slimming and comfortable.  I am glad that mid-rise jeans are back and having my old Levi brand is great.  The only negative is that the fabric is a bit scratchy, but I hope this gets better with washings and fabric softener!
B004FNHJUM|2|This was a real bummer, the shipping was fast but the card pockets are way too small so you can't fit anything in them. This was supposed to be a little stocking stuffer but I'll have to return it since it's basically useless.
B008ZYCSTE|5|I ordered this corset less than a week ago and it arrived in the mail this afternoon. I listened to the other reviewers and ordered a size up from my normal top size, and it fits perfectly. I could probably go a size smaller if I wanted the back open a bit more, but it works perfectly as is.<br /><br />The color in the photo seems a bit lighter than it actually, and I like the fact that it's a darker shade of grey than it seemed. The material is thick and sturdy, and the boning is just sturdy enough to keep everything in shape without being uncomfortable. I'm a tall woman, and the length was just perfect (I'm also high waisted). I can't wait to wear this out of the house.<br /><br />The front clasps are a bit tricky but I had no issues getting it buttoned.<br /><br />I will be ordering more from this company.
B00BQX4A1K|2|The dress is a size 10 which I am accustom buying but this 10 is cut larger the waist is loose and the length is to long
B0090O5MZA|5|I love diesel breifs in general for its comfort and wide innerly cushioned elastic that makes it comfort even if you gain few pounds. I do bodybuilding and when I am on off season I can still wear them and fits nicely.<br /><br />Thanks for reading
B002TDG9T2|5|I have tried everywhere to find these. Even at the Hanes site. So very happy I found them on amazon. I love these bras. They are the only ones I buy. When I find them in the size I need I buy in bulk. They last long and are comfortable.
B00AXITXAM|5|This hat was PERFECT.  I bought 2 to fit my 5 yr. old grandson & me (small female).  He wanted a BFF for both of us & these caps were the perfect thing.  I'll probably have BFF embroidered on each of them.
B00JGHMXK8|4|Baby loved it.  Peppa is the best!
B005GMZ9W6|3|You get what you pay for. They're attractive, but they're very cheaply made--they will fall apart after a few wears and you'll have to re-sew them--and they're pretty small for a men's tie. I guess they're about what you'd expect for the price.
B0047N0CM2|4|Though Elmo is Orange and not red, my 18 month old recognized him right away!  This item is well made.  My only problem is that she wanted to wear it for days in a row, we compromised and let her wear the cute skull cap that also has an Elmo icon on it.
B00M21STI0|5|Amazing shipping time! So cool
B00DJ5Z5T4|3|I bought this in a small as the medium champion tees are too loose. The small fit fine around the waist but it was a little short in the sleeves and tight in the shoulder. I'm tall with long arms and legs so it's not a big surprise to find myself wishing for another inch of fabric in the sleeves but I was disappointed that the shoulders were cut so narrow-that's not usually an issue for me.<br /><br />I'll wear it around the house but probably not to work out in since the cut is a little funny I think it would end up being annoying when I'm trying to move.
B0084B79H4|2|The usual price of this item is $129.99 but I received it for $88.50 through a Black Friday, Amazon lightning deal.  However, I'd like to share why I was disappointed with the Small size received.<br /><br />I'm 5'7\\" and 145.  Though my style isn't at all as trendy as GQ, I do like my clothes to be well-fitted, maybe even tapered.  However, this jacket was significantly too baggy and an X Small is not made.<br /><br />I recommend instead getting the Kenneth Cole Reaction Men's Melton Peacoat With Bib, Black, Small (ASIN: B004S0KRVA) which can be obtained for approximately the same price.  I wish even that item was a tad smaller, but at least the Kenneth Cole gives a V silloutte for the torso... while this was pretty rectangular.<br /><br />Additionally, the bib of this Calvin Klein item is polyester-ish and I wouldn't want to have my jacket open for the world to see that.  Sorta looks cheap.  The bib for the Kenneth Cole is a black knit that looks like a stylish sweater.<br /><br />(Lastly, in case you decide to neither go for this Calvin Klein nor the Kenneth Cole, the London Fog Men's Bartlett Button Front Bibby Car Coat is an okay option. It does not have a bib.  The London Fog is more fitted than the Calvin Klein but less slim than the Kenneth Cole... at least in my experience.<br /><br />Also the Levi's Men's Wool Melton Peacoat gives a boxy silloutte and is even worse than Calvin Klein.)<br /><br />So to review, I'd rank the four \\"Small\\" coats from best to worst as: Kenneth Cole, London Fog, Calvin Klein and then Levi's. X-Small is not available for any of them. Hope this saves you some winter-coat shopping time.
B00EA7DNQW|4|Nice top--once I cut out the padding.  Will add my own bra.  When will they learn that us D-cup gals do not need padding???
B00EN73KVC|3|This is a nice skirt and the price was great, otherwise I would return it.  It was mashed into a tiny bag is badly wrinkled.  Washing and ironing will not remove the wrinkles.  So this is really a 5 for the skirt and a 1 for the mailing.
B002BWP19A|5|I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. It's small enough to fit in his pocket, but has enough slots to carry the essentials.
B000M9O4FG|4|Good price, good product.  I wear these for work (in lieu of scrub pants) and love the feel.  They move well and don't look like I am wearing sweatpants at all!
B00C7MIKUG|1|Fabric is really low quality, it looks old after only a couple of times my daughter wore it. Button fell off within two months of wearing it. Guess that's the quality you get for such a low price but really, I've bought super inexpensive clothes for her and never saw this low quality before.
B00724KBF6|3|large is really medium. especially around the neck.
B00F8MFDDY|2|Smells weird
B00ATIA4MM|4|It a good value for your money, and they have a good return policy.  If it does not fit, there are no problems in returning them, and getting another one that fits.
B00KCXI9SK|5|I actually bought this outfit for my babygirl. It looks great on her. Just because its mickey instead of minnie does NOT mean its for a boy only. This outfit is totally unisex. The material was better than I thought. Its thick like a jogging suit perfect for cold days. The size fits just right. My daughter is 4 months old I bought size 3-6 months.
B004OVCZC2|5|Once again, Amazon proves its metal. I ordered a Navy Blue Blazer from Amazon and I received one that seemed tailor made for me. Amazon included a proper hanger with the Blazer. Bravo! I realize I have been bullish with my reviews of merchandise I ordered from Amazon. But, I have had no choice. They continue to impress me with their truly amazing ability to deliver more than you expected or hoped for.
B00ZT3WSGC|5|I love this Embroidered Kurti tunic,It's a little bit too big for me but i can still wear it.I like that it's long and it can cover my butt.lol..The quality is great and i will recommend this to you.<br />I received this in return of my honest and unbiased review.
B00GYSFL38|1|it says one size fits all not true it is one size fits petites
B00A821QNU|5|really great, quality is good
B0018Q8OEE|5|I finally found a pair of pants which fit my husband!  These are nice quality lightweight trousers.  I wish there were more available and in different colors.
B009CCRK8C|5|Absolutely the most perfect and comfortable socks I have ever worn! Soft and cushioned for serious comfort. I work outside in the cold Northeast alon with a lot of snow removal, and these socks kept my feet warm in dry for two days. No other socks have even this great. Buy them now you will be thrilled! Buying more for myself now and for my wife and teens.
B004H3X7N8|3|I do like these socks a lot but I wish the color selections were a bit better thought out.  I get a decent amount of use out of the pink, purple and black pair but the blue and green color do not match a thing in my baby girls closet.  Given that it is nearly impossible to find clothes (especially newborn sizes) that aren't pink or purple, I wish I could get a pack that was mostly pinks and purples.  When you factor in that I can't use half the socks in the pack, 20 bucks for 3 pairs of socks is a bit much for me.
B00GN6J13C|4|I am 5'7, 130 lbs.  I typically wear a size 6-8; however, this suit is a little small in boob area.  I purchased a Medium because Large wasn't an option, so it will have to do, but I would have preferred a Large.  The suit is cute, but my husband is not crazy about the cutout under the boobs.  I am hoping that it will grow on him, but I doubt it will :)  I don't think that I can wear it without the attached straps, but that's okay!
B00CMR1KXK|1|Item was not as shown.  Instead received a bright shiny green corset that looked more like a halloween costume.
B00J9B7DFG|5|EL conjunto es fiel a la fotografia! Hermoso conjunto, hermosa combinacion de colores!
B00XHLKJSW|1|More like boys large, not women's!
B00FRG7WPI|4|Smaller than I thought but still nice, arrived quickly.
B00A76I8BU|5|My husband loves Deadliest Catch, with deep respect and admiration for Phil Harris.  This T came right at the time of his birthday.  The quality is super and it's a great tribute to the salty dog.  Thank you
B00IZA6ZEW|1|I ordered these as a gift for some and they are not even close to the size listed.  I just kept them for myself and wear them around the house.
B00N3FW2U0|5|Very well made of heavy grade, durable materials. The buckle is not just stamped tin, but thick, machined, metal. The cotton belt is thick enough to make it a tight fit in some belt loops. This is not just a one-summer-and-throw-it-away belt. Worth the money
B00ISRCO9C|5|My nephew loved it.
B00BSDYN8I|4|My one and only complaint about this hat is that it is quite deep for a toddler. My son has a large head and it fits his circumference well, but sits very tall on his head.
B0081LDS1S|5|Just loved  these items , I give them to kids who visit me form the UK and they like them also ,
B00IANH6OM|5|The zipper on the side is a bit unusual and requires a bit of getting used to. It still has a nice look, though.
B00ALZ24Y4|4|This wallet has just the right size! Good quality, good design and good real leather!!! XD The only problem was the color... I asked for a grey wallet, the box of the wallet says &#34;gray&#34; but when i unpacked the wallet, it was a brow wallet! Man! What a disappointment... Besides that, the wallet is the best! =)
B00FW7WQ0S|1|Package came with one pair of the wrong size underwear, and the underwear that was sized wrong had an obvious hole in the seam where it had been tried on and returned. I am not as thrilled with the idea of paying for the 12 pack, getting two pairs of the wrong size, and on top of that had been sneaked in with a defect. I don't feel like going to the trouble of returning.
B00TSPYL3K|5|The color is represented accurately.  I have two Costa hats and love them both.
B003F4UD8W|5|Hard to find decent shorts at this time of year but Amazon came through with a high quality short. Product arrived on time and as described. Washes great. No ironing necessary. Fits great.
B0078Z0TAQ|5|This is THE PERFECT PETTICOAT.  The perfect fit.  The perfect weight.  The perfect length. The perfect amount of poof.  Utter perfection.  I would have paid twice as much for it.  Perhaps I shouldn't admit that, but shows how thrilled I am with it.  It goes - you guessed it, perfectly - under all three of my 50s fit and flare dresses - and provides that authentic look.  I am ready for the next sock hop!
B000VVZTJU|5|Very beautiful dress, with excellent quality. I like it very much. It fit me very well. It is much much more than worthy around 7 bucks!!
B002Y1JXXS|3|This hoodie sizing seems off. It fits smaller than my others that are the same size.  The design and colors on the one I purchased are very different than depicted. Later, I was informed that each hoodie is designed, uniquely. That information and/or pics of variation samples would have been helpful prior to purchasing it. I still like it, and I plan to keep it.
B00J9RAJ2Y|5|Good quality very pleased.
B0038MNYNW|5|I usually wear a size large so thats what I ordered and they were way to tight in the package area. Through out the day they became more and more uncomfortable, to the point I had to take them off. I really liked the look and the material so I ordered the x large and they fit way better.
B00KHP80QE|4|I ordered this for my grandson for Christmas. When he opened it, he was so excited...  Will be ordering 2 more for my other grandson's.
B00BYEOIYA|4|This is a nice summer sweater with very cute designs.  However, it does run large and is not fitted.  I usually wear a medium and it was very boxy on me.
B005CW064G|5|Buen material, la talla encajo perfectamente
B000W9K5VI|3|The waist fit about as expected as my other pair of Carhartts.  But, the legs were much wider.  They looked clownish and I returned them.
B00E9ZMYP6|4|I'm finding that it's working for me, but it may work different for everyone.  It does make your breasts sit really high, but it sort of retrains them to sit higher even when you take the vest off.  I have been wearing my vest at least 4-5 times a week now up to 8 hours each time.  I've had this vest for about 3 weeks now.<br /><br />If you are a curvy girl, this will accentuate your curviness.  Men do notice, which I didn't realize how much it accentuates your waist to hip ratio, along with pushing your breasts up, but the men will notice.  If you have backfat, this is your friend.  It helps to smooth that backfat out and holds you.  Overtime and with consistency you will lose inches, it's not an overnight process.  I have used steel-boned corsets, this is much more comfortable.  The quality is very good, it is quite durable.<br /><br />It did take me a minute to get into it.  I timed it and it took me 17 minutes.  I bought a 36 and a 34 for as I get smaller.  I can tell once you wear the vest some it is much more comfortable compared to when you first get it on.  Try it, be consistent, and realistic.
B005MYBDKK|5|I love the Lotus  Traders Batik Dresses. They are so elegant, sexy, dressy and yet not. The best dresses I've ever purchased.<br /><br />I love them so much that I now have 6 of them and will buy more each and every year.<br /><br />I literally live in these dresses!!
B00BTVFC0C|5|excelente producto
B00207HTGE|5|I am a hard to fit size bra woman, and I must say after years of looking for the right fit I have found it. This bra is great, a true fit and comfortable. I will buy another, and another.
B00O2GFGZC|5|Soft, stretchy, flattering. I'm 5'5&#34; 120 lbs, and the 2 is perfect.
B008ZEJS6A|5|Fit good, feel good.
B007F358B6|5|loved them
B00GHV3K58|4|Great price, love the style, and very warm in the winter cold. And I love the color of white, stlyelish
B00LSRU1QW|5|Just what I expected.
B00Q5W0TM6|4|High quality material except for the big buttons - as meanwhile quite usual on material like this, they stick them on only with a thin twine so we had to take them down to not loosen them and used a better material to stick it on again. Thats why I deduct one star, except of that it is highly recommended for deep winter freezes.
B00QMIZCKC|5|My little guy loves this belt. It is very easy to adjust and super easy for small fingers to fasten and unfasten thanks to the magnet. Highly recommend if you have a young child who wears a belt or if your child hasn't quite developed his fine motor skills.
B007G102ZO|5|Very cute and sexy. Not too short. The purple is just like the pic and so is the dress. Really worth what I paid for it.
B001D164G4|2|no
B00EDRYXTA|4|Love this!  I saw it in Lord and Taylor first.  It's a little cheaper on Amazon.  Fits great...looking forward to wearing it this summer! This was delivered quickly and looks exactly like the picture online!
B009PXKJQ8|4|This sweater is very nice and warm.  The color is great and with the large calvin klein logo on the sleeve, there is no doubt people will know what your wearing.  But this sweater is not for fat people, or for those with protruding belly like me.  This is for slim or fit people as the fit is straight; without allowance for the bulge.
B003A73REG|5|Order large and you will be satisfied.  I ordered the 12-18 month size for our 4 month, 17 lbs twin boys and they will be great for the summer.  Just slightly loose, so I think we will get a good 3 month season out of them.  Great style for diaper changing - zipper for ease over head, and snaps for diapers.
B00D7BTLFE|2|My husband wears size 36 waist in Dockers.  These were way to small and did not come within four inches of being able to fasten.
B0066SJPS8|5|I got this for my daughter who is a great fan of Downton Abbey.  It is a beautiful hat and she LOVES it!  It is perfect with her vintage costume.  Design and materials are lovely and price is surprising for a high quality looking item.  No disappointment here.
B00HHBPYC4|4|I love the color and quality, it was just slightly tight across the chest area. I wear a scarf to cover.
B00M90VQK2|5|Love the gloves.  The are light weight but very warm.  It is nice to be able to use my IPhone without taking my gloves off.
B00I04WFCY|4|Very cute dress, fits well, and is good quality.  Wrinkles easily, but that it to be expected with this fabric.
B009SIPDRK|4|This  top is lovely and the material is quality. I find that I need to wear a cami-type bra under it, or too much clevage shows. I am a size large bordering on an XL, and the large fit great. I am a 40E
B00J7YU06O|5|I cannot wait for my husband to see it on Christmas!  Shirt is thick and durable from the feel.  So much better than many shirts of this type.
B00MT5O3I4|5|It's beautiful. Just as I expected. I'm excited to wear it in my vacation.
B00D73AMOQ|1|I had read all the reviews and purchased MUCH larger than my size so had some hope that I had come close to my size. What I got was nothing even close. I could tell this product had already been sent to someone else and resent to me and no wonder!!<br /><br />Don't waste your time!!
B00CNNE1JI|1|It does not fit and hang like it shows in the picture. It's more like shower curtains hanging off of a body.
B00JGWJS2Y|2|Already has a hole
B009MS0N4E|3|Its cute and just as described, however the ears do not stand up and aren't as fully stuffed as I'd like them to be, and a bit big for my head, so sadly I had to return.
B00JMBM8GC|1|These jeans cost a lot of money.  You would think they would be made correctly.  The yoke on the back of th jeans was not sewn  correctly therefore creating wrinkles in the yoke. The yoke was not trimed properly. The seams of the yoke created a big pointy protrusion that would not lay flat, therefore the fit was horrible. I am beginning to wonder if they are knock-offs.  I have other miss me jeans and they are quality made. These were horrible.
B00ET7U0RI|4|Beautiful piece but I gotta tell you you will need help to get into it...not so much out of it.
B000VYQJRS|2|A lot of the glitter has fallen off of the shirt even before I wore it for the first time. The glue that supposed to be holding on the glitter is showing on most of the design. One of the shoulders is off set, which isn't in the description.
B000C1OW06|5|The shirt is really nice. You can't see it in the photo, but it has a smoky, faint, horizontal pattern of soft subtle shades of grey. Not stripes though. It's a plain shirt. This look that I am describing is very common in plain grey adult shirts. I really like the style. Fit's my two year old just right.
B004A7YLPY|5|very happy with it, handles a lot of bills, but feels like it stays small.  leather quality is very good and holds many cards.  probably best wallet i've had in a while.
B007PBERBU|2|The waist was too low; the pants too tight and the boot cut too narrow.  I don't wear them that often.
B00JQDCLCM|4|Good
B00VGTWHVE|3|This is really good I like it I'm enjoying it.
B00AIHRJL8|3|one size is a good idea for manufacture but not real a good idea for customer ; make money yes, but make money with every body is really happy is better. One day... may be....
B00DXZT76C|5|I like the coat
B00MYFVBKC|3|Cute sweatshirt, it was just shorter than I expected.
B00C9XMUBI|2|Nice outfit. Came with a very noticeable stain on the hoodie. It was like I bought something that someone else returned.
B0089CPHAY|3|Shorts were too small from waist to crotch.  I wear Petite size 8 or 10 so small and medium should have fit better.  Not enough description of that feature.  I do not have a tummy, so that wasn't the problem.  If shorts are for a teen-age body, description should have said so.  Quality was Okay, so I gave it 3 Stars for that.
B00LI6MFM6|3|Just okay.  Comes out very wrinkled from wash.  Good for gym use not for wearing out.  Other hurley t-shirts are much better quality.
B00553XM84|1|the sizing on this bra is terrible- the two top reviews must be fake. I ordered 2 different sizes- and the cups are HUGE, with all this extra fabric, and the band, too small though I ordered a size up in the band and a size down in the cup.<br /><br />even with the straps as tight as possible, there was still bounce.<br /><br />Complete waste, and I had really high hopes.
B00CP3B8PG|5|Love this dress on my daughter; especially with her cowgirl boots! With the length being above the knee, she does have to wear shorts under.
B007HRYSQ6|5|These pants are PERFECT. I'm 5' 10&#34; and I wear a TXS in urbane, landau, med couture, etc. The reviews said to order a size up from what you normally wear, and the TS was great. Good length and the material is really nice, too. Plus, the color is so pretty.
B00G9BLGW0|1|This skirt is super cute, and I LOVE the fabric.  It is easy to pack in a bag, or wash and wear.  These sizes, however, run SMALL.  I would order at least a size larger, maybe two.
B0083IAKD8|5|I do love med couture. They are so soft and comfortable. I generally buy larges so my scrubs do not &#34;fit&#34; Me. I want them baggy. But I ordered a medium in these because a friend said go down a size on med couture. Sge was riGht. They do run large and my mediums fit very well. They do not hug me, instead they hang loosely which I love. They last forever too. Great buy and great prIce.
B00P68KTW0|5|Exceptionally comfortable and well designed.  Colors are deep and rich.  Elasticity seems quite good
B00DFLG51Y|4|after reading reviews I understood that the top ran small.  I ordered a medium and it is cut small under my arms.  I hope the funny smell goes away after a few washes. Febreez helped.
B00HYU08ZQ|5|It looks very pretty! I like the combination and the material. It is hard to buy by internet as you cannot touch the material but I really like it!
B00ZTDJUCW|5|good material, 120 pounds and 5'5 very good for me
B00RCHX4I4|2|This is a shapeless, pajama-looking, lounging, too large, blah-garment. There is so much fabric and it looks so strange on me. The asymmetric design is unique and thickness of.the fabric is decent tho. But I wont be keeping this.
B006AN5CEA|5|Love them :)
B0114GDTLU|5|Love it
B00DRVFPPO|5|Very cute
B00CMVQLL2|1|I take pity on the soul that wastes money to buy and wear this shirt. Seriously, how could anyone think this is a good message. Plus the colors are terrible. Pink and Green. Why does this shirt exist? Who's idea was this? To be honest i just feel like giving something a hard time. It's still pretty bad though, like really? This is a shirt.
B00E01QZOU|5|The hat came 2 days after I ordered; they estimated a week. Also great quality and fits as close to perfect as it can. Quality material, and everything looks terrific
B0053THG2I|3|I bought this and some other pumpkin lights. I did not care for the strobe light effect but looked really cool in the pumpkins. But this one was not very bright and was hard to see.
B00NBEJHWY|4|Got it for my almost 3month old as a x-mas present.. Still got to see. Got it a size 6m since 3m are nowhere near fitting anymore. It arrived a week after ordering. Looks good and warm
B00P5Q4M12|5|I love the dress, the top fits kinda small though
B00BY3KUH0|5|I was very pleased with the way the jacket fit & the color. I couldn't find anything like it in the stores.
B00AQK4ALE|5|This outfit looks amazing on my son and fits well. Did not shrink in the wash and dryer which was a nice surprise. The outfit color does not fade in the wash either which is nice and I have washed the outfit a lot
B00K7YL6BG|3|The hoodie is smaller than expected. It may be a five, but definitely shouldn't be considered a size six. Comparing it with other size five hoodie shows it small. Hopefully it doesn't shrink or it won't fit.
B0079ETFME|5|My husband loves this tie.  It is very shiny and stands out compared to other ties people are wearing out.
B00GRDC372|5|On and off, over the past year, I have been looking for a suitable replacement to my current wallet which always is left &#34;somewhere&#34; other than my pants pocket because it's too large and heavy.  Filled with about nearly two dozen different cards, it has become enormously thick and unattractive.<br /><br />A simple Google search for &#34;best thinnest mens wallet&#34; brought me to an article that compared many of the best rated wallets.  The Allet Classic Leather Wallet was among those in that group.  First thing I did was come to Amazon and read the many, many positive reviews.  Of course, you can sit here and read dozens of praises and still come away not believing you are going to get a wallet that truly satisfies you.<br /><br />So, I took a chance and ordered this wallet.  What the heck.  It costs under $40 and I figured if I didn't like it, I could return it.<br /><br />The wallet arrived last evening.  Taking it out of the package it seemed quite nice.  It's made of pliable leather and rip-stop nylon.  This morning, I began loading my credit, bank and reward cards into the 4 compartments that align both sides of the wallet.  I put a wad of bills into the cash compartment and then folded everything up.<br /><br />Amazing!  Absolutely Amazing!  You really have to see it for yourself to believe it.<br /><br />That bulky mess of a wallet I used to own was streamlined into something neat and compact.  I was actually easily able to slide it into the front of my pants with no resulting bulge.  I mean, for the first time in memory, I actually want to put my wallet in my pants pocket.<br /><br />This wallet totally redefines everything we used to know about our wallet.  We don't need long, horizontal wallets with center flaps that encourage us to stuff as much crap as we can inside of it.  Allet has created a more vertical design, keeping it simple, keeping it thin.<br /><br />You really need to experience this wallet for yourself.  I think you will be as amazed as I was.ed as I was.
B00EMPJI8E|5|Only complaint no pockets
B00PIAPRX2|5|Was nervous about purchasing a bra like this online not knowing how it was going to fit or the quality of the sticky. I couldn't be happier. It fit perfect and it stuck on very well. The case it comes in is something all sticky bras should come in, makes throwing it in my suitcase worry free of it sticking to everything. Once this one is all worn out I will be purchasing it again from the same place.
B00J6CZSSW|2|Very short ,fabric OK but not flowing enough and when on is just a strange mix of not short but not long
B000VK2KVG|5|Glamorise is one of my favorite bras.  I have lots of them in this style.
B000FXW50K|5|I like Carhartt products - well made and good looking.  It has just enough metal snaps to look really different!
B0007CKN3U|5|Priced just right and shipped very quickly.
B00J5UNJNQ|5|My daughter loves them
B002WDMUEW|5|We bought two sets of these so we'd have matching socks. Our 5 year old loves them. They go all the way up to mid-thigh and she wears them with skirts or under her pants. She loves boots so these are perfect to keep her ankles from rubbing. They are well made and are holding up nicely to our crazed tomboy of a little girl.
B007TIR8Z6|5|Excellent fit (32x32), nice material. Nice pair of pants without breaking the buck. I bought the dark grey and a very pleased with the color.
B00CBLT5RK|5|Although I didn't get the colors shown, but it was good.
B00T8Y0L94|5|I was very pleased with my order
B00N9UDUIW|3|This is a very cute shirt, but runs VERY small. Order a size or 2 larger than what you usually wear. It is a thin t-shirt material, but is not see-through.
B00YP0FCT0|5|Perfect! Soft n comfy.. you dont feel the grippies like on normal socks. And these definetly help you from slipping on the yoga mat!
B00E754Y9W|5|These are my favorite tights! Lord of the Rings map!  MY name is even on the map/tights. Cool and warm so they will be great as long underwear as well.
B004QYINQO|5|For a long time, I have looked for netting for my sandals.  Unfortunately, most of it would make me look like a complete floozy, rather than just the slight jazzing-up i've been looking for.  That is, until I found this product.  This is exactly what I needed.  It makes my sandals look good without making me look like a slut.  Once I started using it, i've had to start beating off the women with a stick.  As an extra plus, it also seems to be irresistible to dogs.
B000WN0RG2|5|PERFECT for my simple wedding day that I wanted to add a pinch of &#34;fancy&#34; to. Added a curly edge veil and its perfect.<br />Very pretty very shiny, not too over the top.
B00LF9KTDI|4|This is Adorable!!!!! A great buy for such a cute outfit.
B009T5M2N0|4|The fabric seems sturdy enough, decent quality for the price.  I'm 6' 1&#34;, 195 lbs and ordered the XXL.  The sleeves are the perfect length and shoulders are a good fit.  Since it's double-breasted, it's not going to look like the photo when it's unbuttoned.  When buttoned up, it figs slightly snug, but comfortable.
B00DLK1K0K|3|WASN'T THRILLED WITH THE MATERIAL
B009O8GFMQ|4|I got this as a Christmas gift, and love the feel of the material. The look...well, that neckline is super plunging, but nothing a little cami or coverup won't fix. It is very clingy, so loving all the curves you have is definitely something you need to wear this!
B008H2ETBE|5|As a woman, how do I use these? I cut the toes off and after applying Bag Balm to my knees... slip them over my legs to keep my sheets cleaner longer. Who wants to wash sheets daily?... not me!!!
B002GHC2QK|3|I must say the fit on this seems shorter than I wanted.. especially for being listed as a big and tall item. Its also thinner than i pictured most Carhartt jackets but i suppose it works.<br /><br />I'll be buying a different style (obviously) but you can't mess with Carhartt's overall quality (hence the 3 stars)
B000I164DI|5|We love you them at our coffee shop
B009OGH18K|5|My Granddaughter Lved the Robe and it Fit Perfect. Made better<br />Than I expected with quality material. Very Pleased with quick service,<br />As well as packaging of product.
B00UKRTY8W|5|Cute!!
B00C3VX4RA|5|Bought this as a nightgown. The cotton is very high quality and it fits beautifully. Very flattering and can dress up or down
B00CMSSTQK|1|My son likes the picture but the zipper broke the 1st day my son used it.  So, poor quality construction.
B00R7QHOZ4|4|It very cute and comfy. Great for summer and on the go over a swim suit or not.
B00NP8IVVY|5|ok
B003HIFOXK|4|My weight and heighth are right in the center of the B size chart. I found them to be a bit too snug for comfort. It was very tight getting the waist band over the hips.
B0091IJWLK|2|I just bought the 'honey mustard' and the 'chocolate' at BCO direct;  they arrived today.  Think Dijon mustard and flat grayish chocolate, for the true colors.<br /><br />These are truly thin shirts, far from what I'd call 'perfect'.  They seem to be made by the same folk as 'Dreams & Co.' or 'American Apparel', both sourced in Pakistan, but here travelling under the Woman Within label.  That's a bad omen.  I've not had good luck with those brands.<br /><br />They are sized smaller than the size names, so order one size bigger, unless you want them to fit you tightly.  Also order a size bigger if you plan to just toss the shirt in your regular wash, because they will shrink, even when tumble dried low.  100% cotton, says the label.  They are well sewn.<br /><br />The material is extremely thin, like tee shirts from Mexico or other very hot country.  Better to get Hanes or Gildan.  Finally, these shirts are overpriced, compared to the former two.  I wish I'd not bought them, but I was expecting these to be like the other shirts I'd bought from BCO, via Amazon.  The Amazon-sold versions were far better.  But these are the same as advertised here (same pictures as at BCO), so these shirts are NOT what I got, before.<br /><br />Good news is, though they were shipped in those rumpled bags the plus-sized companies are so fond of using, the shirts weren't much wrinkled.<br /><br />If you want a better turtleneck, then, shop for something else.
B00ZHXU4UG|5|My 20-something daughter wore this dress for an alumni gala soiree. She received many compliments and inquiries as to where she found such a beautiful dress. The fit was exact and the style simply gorgeous.<br />But the &#34;acid test&#34; is how well was it made? This was for my (amateur seamstress) wife to find out. Her report was that the cut, seams and sawing material was very good. Particulerly impressed with the fully lined and built-in bra structure, and flowing drape. Her main objection was that the fabric was not natural, but polyester chiffon.<br />Both my wife and daughter were pleased with dress, which matches others in elegance and quality, that cost several multiples of its price.<br /><br />A complimentary sample was provided for testing & evaluation, but with no obligation to write a review. This is not a barter deal. I have no financial or personal connection with the manufacturer, seller or their employees.
B00BM9VK0M|5|Nice shirt - well made.
B00EEIKPF4|5|The colors are deep and rich and it fits so nice. Very nice summer weight.<br />The product was as pictured. Worth the price.<br />It arrived quickly and in good shape.
B0007A2Q6O|5|I've alway's liked longer type wallet's, they hold more and don't stack up creating a huge bulge in my pocket, and fit a suit/sport coat more comfortable, plus I've never really liked having a thick wallet in my back pocket. The credit card leather straps in my present wallet got stretched out, and my cards were falling out. After losing a couple of credit cards and debit card, I was on the hunt for a ZIPPERED long wallet. After checking the web and finding prices of between $50-$300! I hit Amazon, and found this wallet. Amazing price, zippered, with lots of interior space and SECURE.<br />This wallet holds my credit cards, ID, cash, business cards,and assorted small bits of paperwork, all without creating a huge bulge. I love it. Its long enough that currency fits in without a struggle, and if I want to carry of couple of checks I dont have to fold them.<br />I thought for the price it would be cheap, and poor grade leather and zipper, but read some of the reviews and thought at this price if I dint like it it wasnt a big loss. Turns out its made very well, good grade leather, well made zipper. Gem Aveneue shipped fast, packaged well, not a problem. As another reviewr said I liked it so much I bought 2 so if this one ever does wear out I have a replacement, but its well made, as normal its a bit stiff, but will soften up with use, and the zipper will prevent any loss. Great wallet.
B004XH4ZDE|2|I need some top to use under cartigans and blazers for work. To be honest was looking for a cheap top. I thought that this would work but material is very cheap threading around the neck looks very poorly done. But you get what you pay for.
B006002804|5|The present was just what he wanted
B0089N5MKS|5|Great quality hat, didn't have fraying in the rim like other hats Ive ordered. Fit perfectly adjusted<br />Well to my head, and color as promised.
B003XO49VQ|5|Arrived on time. Product was as described
B00AKWBILS|3|It got here really quick especially coming from china. I was expecting another month or two but I received it probably 2 weeks after I ordered it.<br /><br />The tights quality itself are kind of weird. I mean they look nice but they look like they have been spray painted on or paint with a brush and theres this shiny look to them at a certain angle (Lycra in them). Reminds me of those cheap artsy entry floormats from home depot. I havent worn them yet but they look and feel comfortable.<br /><br />It looks like its one size fits all but I doubt that more of a small to medium which is fine for me but if you wear large leggings I wouldn't buy it.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Okay so I finally wore them and they sort of suck. They make a wishing noise when you walk and mind you I am not a big girl. I'm 5'1 115lbs and it makes noise like crazy. It feels really uncomfortable on and you can tell its a fake print when it stretches over your skin.
B008P4U6G6|2|Stretch out while you're wearing them, still cute and comfortable but the material is cheap. I wouldn't buy another pair
B000N8RWHI|5|i thought these pants i bought for my son were well made and i particularly like the heavy duty zipper front
B00CQGJ9IK|5|I am a huge fan of Nicole Miller for Girls, so I knew when I bought these to size up.  My girls are just about four and I got these in size 5.  They fit perfect and they are adorable!  Very pleased, as always, with her clothing line!
B000VK7UXE|5|A great product. I am very pleased. Wide straps are not putting pressure on his shoulders. Good holds chest. I will buy another color.
B00DNT98YE|5|Very nice quality tie. Easier to match with turquoise rather than mint if it matters.
B000JVWN5K|5|What ever size you are PLEASE GO.....UP !!
B00KD0DXQK|3|When I took this product out of the bag it looked like someone just put an iron over the whole dress which made marks from the embroderity. I will order another to see if the samething happens
B00G9QQAGW|5|Cute suit. Good material quality.
B004HHNV12|5|This boardshort is very confortable. MY son adores it. It is flexible, slims and Great uv protection. Runs TRUE to size.
B00SXB9FP4|5|I love this shirt.  Very soft and breathable.
B00K235BCM|5|The colors used in this shirt are great and the actual shirt is made in India so nice pastels are indeed special.....I love this shirt
B00MY7INX8|1|Not real Ralph Lauren, the black color was already faded upon arrival. Will return asap.
B00PLUYJ4C|4|excellent
B00C3VF4FK|3|I usually wear a large or x-large, as I am a size 16. I ended up having to buy a medium petite to get these pants to fit which are required for my nursing school.
B002ZEFCXE|5|This is a great buy for the Burberry look that I desired. Warm elegant and stylish
B000H6DKNG|4|The length is fine and after a couple of wash and wear cycles they've stretched to fit. I will buy another pair at some time in future...
B001E95JYI|5|Totally perfect in every way!
B00C54FEG4|2|Usually I buy cheaper made in Canada or made in the USA socks, but I thought I'd try some higher price made in China Timberlands. I had too much trust, and bought 8 pairs or these and 8 pairs of the full trail socks. These have no breathability compared to other cheaper socks. They are very comfortable and look really cool, but after wearing for a week at work, the insides of my toes are beginning to peal a lot of skin due to always being wet. I am very disappointed, considering I thought these big name socks would be better. Do yourself a favour and get Stanfields, a lower cost made in North America alternative. I don't know why we shell out big bucks for this made in China stuff, just so Timberland can make millions on subpar products.
B00CJQHUUG|5|Love the dress that I got although it's a lil bit long to me of course I'm a petite girl but still love it.
B00KGDEZL6|1|A FLIMSY LITTLE PIECE OF FABRIC.EXPENSIVE.I THOUGHT IT WOULD AT LEAST BE PLASTIC.
B0059A7478|5|The top fits just as expected.
B00JAC0XNS|5|Great fit. Best bali I have found in a while.
B0077UGEME|1|I wear a medium in almost all mens clothing (and don't mind a tight fit) but this was ridiculous, like kids medium. plus product label claims to be &#34;extra soft&#34; but it's about as soft as a burlap sack.
B007VUKH9G|5|I am pleased with this robe. It's soft and thick, but not too heavy. The quality of terry cloth is very good and it washes beautifully. I use it every day.
B00HWFBE8I|5|This top fits perfectly, makes me look slimmer, and the purple color has brought many compliments.great bargain top.  Buy it!!
B005GV377G|1|really cool! on time! nice quality! but the damn thing was way too small  wont fit any thing but the smallest of heads. boo
B00KUB8H6S|1|Extremely large & very stiff & heavy.  I had to return it.
B00FF9VCYO|4|These are relatively comfortable and very cute. I have been wearing them all summer and they still look like new.
B0002TOZ1E|5|Hubby loved it!
B00PW4LNKK|5|I love these little finger puppets for my little niece.
B003XF2V4M|1|I do not have any comment cause after one month  I am still waiting on this item ...so what can I say !!!   when or let say if  I get this jacket at all I will be more than happy to review this Item.
B0056DU3RG|2|I bought them last year because I thought they were cute and then I would let my baby wear them after he was 1 year old. When my baby was 13 months old, I opened and just found they were too small. The size information was not right.
B00337JXSM|4|For a price like this one should not expect a high quality product, which it isn't (the leather looks a bit flimsy, is unevenly sewn and has mismatching finish).  That may be okay, though, if looks and durability are not of primary concern, you need a coin pouch and don't want to spend too much $$.  Bought it for my 13-year old and he's perfectly happy.
B00GH9UZUS|5|Great quality, great fit, great dress!!  The size guide provided is spot on.  The dress is adorable and very flattering.
B002HJ3G0S|5|This is exactly what I was looking for; very difficult to find.  These are what used to be known as peds, I simply can't live without them in warm weather.  For some reason they aren't available in retail stores any longer.  I was concerned these would come up too high on the top of the foot and show in some shoes, but I just pull them down a bit on the underside of the foot to solve this issue.  I'm very pleased and highly recommend this product.
B00U13BIX4|5|Best dress.  It makes me look skinnier good shape
B00NY59LCG|5|I got this for a friend who got her nursing degree...she loves it!
B009AFGYDI|1|To small!
B00FFI5Z02|5|Excellent
B000QURHUU|2|they work they were just too big and didn't really help me with support alone. they stick well but they got destroyed from it accidentally getting in contact with ocean water and sand.
B00GI6IVJC|5|Comfortable and flattering!  Love this. I ordered 2!!!  I ordered a large and I'm a size 10-12.
B00DGM7CPA|5|excellent
B001CVCMPW|5|Very cute and for a girl who always finds the small sizes to still be a bit big I was pleasantly surprised that this fit perfectly. That being said it may be wise to go up a size larger than you normally do for that tight but not too tight look. It glows in the dark great,it does show panty lines so plan your undergarments accordingly. I got lots of compliments and will wear this quite a few more times.
B00O4YU0YY|5|Love Penguin Clothes!!!
B003KW7O0E|2|Order three belts like this from three different places.  The other two were almost double price.  You get what you pay for.  This one is cheaper, not leather.
B0086L1FK4|5|One word describes these pants-Excellent!
B007SWZAMQ|5|I like the shirt, it is convenient for nursing. The color is very different from the picture though, more of a dark turquoise than green.
B00NLXTBEE|5|Love this blue velvet dress. Fits well. made well. Perfect for winter in cali
B00TA51Q6I|5|very nice,fits well and does not look cheap!
B007GB5W3Q|5|Sweet little PJs with nice embroidery.  Shipped on time and seem like great quality... haven't washed them yet as they will be a Christmas gift, but so far very pleased.
B00OQYQEGA|5|Love the shirt!
B00BL9G2SI|5|Good fit and Good material.
B00375PNR0|3|the small was a bit too tight and had to return it. Should have gone with the Medium. Quality was good though.
B00E1L9PKU|4|This top is made of very comfortable fabric! I like the fit, although it is not as expected. It is not as long as it appears in the photo,  or is it as shapely.
B00OMMYQD4|1|Ok
B000GHO5TO|4|Does what it's supposed to do. Keeps rain off your upper body. Super thick material makes it a bit warm indoors though. I ordered the green and it's a very strange color green. Kind of between hunter and sage green, but overall I'm pleased with my purchase.
B002KR8IJQ|2|when i get this dress i discovered that al this price is for just a hat and a small skirt or cut i didnt exactly know what it was so its so expensive ... the fabric is not that much but it was really a great hat
B00GXJG6CI|5|the product is what I expected beautiful perfect
B0000DZJL4|5|Just what I was looking for ;-)
B00ECU47E4|3|Its a little tight and looks cheap and it smells like moth balls pretty bad.. it looks sexy if your really skinny tho.
B005HYU1V2|4|This item shipped way before expected which waa really nice! The gloves are prolly a M/L and so were a pittle big on me but still super cute so I kept them.
B00GPZIWFE|4|A bit small for son, but he is still wearing it so he must like ti
B002RTSN6U|2|I don't like it because it says &#34;big girls&#34; which led me to assume juniors. Perhaps it's my fault; but I thought this would fit my teen. She wears a 6 no matter what the brand! this size 6 is for  a child; not a &#34;big girl.&#34;
B00F9RJLTU|1|Didn't like it is a coat for a little girl and the store want you to return it back to China and states they are not respondable for lot item and it cost so must to return the jacket I just gave it away Very Poor Business I say fault on both party not directly with the owner of the store
B00GZ0308S|5|Excellent quality and craftsmanship, highly recommend.
B006GV971K|4|It is a good, basic FR work shirt. Roomy fit unlike a lot of imported stuff that.<br />Like most treated cotton FR clothing it does not breathe well, but I have not found any that does.
B00L5HP8K4|1|send me a different color and a smaller size. I'm so disappointed
B008H4JN36|3|Color is great, style is attractive, but the quality leaves much to be desired - drawstring broke on first wear, every time I squat or bend I can hear threads pop and snap, don't expect to get more than a couple of wears out of these before they come apart at the seams.
B000P55R6W|5|Great, need more.
B00U9S1YHG|4|Cute, just a little on the small side.
B002ATCWR8|5|I have been looking for a leotard to replace my old favorite that is now worn out. This leotard is now my favorite!I'm happy with the way that it fits me. It might not flatter everyone, but I'm happy with the cut and style; even the fabric type.
B00QFSK1HS|4|Good fit, but cotton quality could be better!
B00IMTY5H0|4|I wish I had ordered a size large, but I hope in a few months it will fit great. I'm 37 weeks, 5'4&#34;, 140 lbs (120 lbs pre-preg). Otherwise, the dress/night-shirt is wonderful. It is very comfortable to sleep in and I'm even thinking of wearing it to my baby showers. Very versatile!  Update: still love it. Do wish I had ordered the large- even 4 months post baby (130 lbs). The nursing slit is vertical which (in my opinion) requires a cover to nurse in public as skin can be seen up to my shoulder. As pjs though, no one cares and I love the support.
B008B424TC|3|la chaqueta me vino manchada en a parte interna, parecia orina de algun animal, como ratas , era una gran mancha amarilla, por lo que debi lavarla
B00LHN8CYA|2|SO UPSET, LOOKS NICE BUT RUNS WAY TO SMALL.  RETURNED
B00K1940H4|3|Super cute style. WAY TOO SMALL! Trust the reviews order a couple sizes up, maybe 3 sizes bigger. DO NOT buy the burnt orange color, it is sherbet orange, not even close to the right color.
B00H95R4E4|5|One of the most adorable maternity dresses I've found. The dusty pink is beautiful. The quality is great as well as the fit.
B00PUSZ016|4|Awesome deff recommend, would of given 5 stars if one sock didn't come with small hole.
B00B9L462C|5|A very well made, handsome cap!
B00M2J07KU|5|I ordered this for my tall 5 year old son. My son is probably about the height of the average 6 year old (45 inches) and he is 45 pounds (he can fit 5T clothes but I order him size 6 shirts just for the length in the arms because he is tall). I ordered this costume in size 4-6 and was worried because often this size is too short on him. But it fit him perfectly. If you have a short 4 year old you may want to order the smaller size because the head piece and body piece may be too long.<br /><br />There is a one piece body suit which you put on first, then you put on the snowman piece and finally the head piece. It is a bit of a pain for your kid to go to the bathroom as you have to take the snowman part off and then undo the bodysuit and pull it all the way down and hold it so it doesn't fall on the floor. Ie, your child will need assistance going to the bathroom with this costume on.<br /><br />The head piece is a tad big, It did fall in my son's face a bit, but he has a big head (again probably a size 6 year old head) so it mostly stayed put. Again, a smaller child, especially a four year old, may have a hard time keeping the head piece from falling in their eyes. The quality of the material is really nice and the costume looks well made and not cheap. Overall, it is really cute and I would buy it again.<br /><br />I attached a photo so you can see how it fits a child with the measurements I described above. Note, the white dots on the sleeves are from fake snow at an event we attended. The costume did not have any white spots on it.
B00KR4X1LY|5|Love the quality of this shirt!
B000KGMHBO|5|Bought this shirt for my husband to wear to work..He works oil field and he refuses to get it dirty..Its that nice of a shirt. Very well made and fits excellent. I plan on buying a few more.
B009DZ6M8C|5|I like it
B00CANXILI|4|These are perfect for 5'7&#34;. Waist rides a little high. Not a wash & dry material - wrinkles sets when washing & drying
B00LH5NJPA|5|Good quality,
B00D2XJ7IS|3|Awesome shirt with a great prayer.  Fits as expected. Would have give 4 or 5 stars if the text was on the back rather than  the front.
B004QJQHF8|5|My wife had some of these socks since the late 1990's and she finally wore them out. She had been looking for replacements, but couldn't find them until we searched Amazon. She likes wearing them with hiking shoes or her Keen's. She would recommend them highly.
B003FN3KKQ|4|Good fit, but these are not bright white if that is what you are looking for. They can look a little \\"eggshell\\" depending on the light.
B00N4GDKIG|3|its ok
B00FG3SE54|5|Badass silkscreen on a great zippered Hoody to satiate my Breaking Bad fixation.I can't collect enough BB paraphernalia to satisfy my soul.
B00307S3KY|5|They seem well made and are very comfortable. Its an \\"athletic\\" short so there is a lining inside like underwear in swimming trunks. Cute and comfortable.
B001H0F2B4|3|The shirt is a good for using as an under shirt but it you are a tall buy then this is not the shirt for you. It works really nice as a workout shirt.
B00AAXYDTG|5|Fits right, feels good, oorah!
B001GG4CGU|4|My son is 20 months old, 24lbs and fits him very well. A little snug from crotch to shoulders but will do just fine. Soft, warm and cozy. Great price. This is the size he normally wears.
B00M2OEY40|3|It's a really cute bra it makes my cleavage look AMAZING but it's definetly small. I fill out a US size 36C perfectly but this 36c size feels more like a 36 or 38b so I would order a size or two up depending on how big your chest is, also be aware the shipping does take awhile so be patient
B009S2HIL0|5|Great product and design. Quality is good although likely won't be worn much. Another great addition to the Daryl collection!
B00HX9B0QY|3|Nice fabric, cute design.  My only gripe is the waist band is rather thick.  I don't need that much elastic for when I'm sleeping.
B00BPUK9FA|5|Great shirt & great material.  Fits a little big but not to the point of needing the next size up.
B008436YQ4|5|Fits well and isn't too thick or thin.
B0014SCXSE|4|Shirt fits as expected.  Quality is good.  Has buttons.  Is blue.  Has sleeves.  Has arm Holes.  Has a place to stick your neck through.
B00DZFRMBM|5|I never travel without this !  Holds passport , global entry, credit cards and cash!
B00IZ50OZS|5|Seriously, the price of this suit is such a steal. So cute and cheap! It's so hard to find a cute bikini type of bathing suit for my toddler, and this is perfect.
B008714M9E|3|Very nice dress but was too tight..didn't make any sense sending back so had to give it away. So whatever you wear buy it one size bigger
B003FSSP0Q|2|It took a long time to get shipped and it does not look like at all to what the picture shows. Colors are poor to the point that it does not look like the logo of thr action hero it is intended too. Not satisfied ...
B00NAWUO88|5|I love Dickies brand pants for school uniforms.  They are extremely durable, the color does not fade and the fit is excellent because of the adjustable waist.  My child is on the slender side, so the slim plus he adjustable waist is a perfect fit.  I highly recommend these.
B00KHG85W2|5|Very well made hat! Not as easily crush-able like other hats we have had. Made in Seattle USA! No ragged edges, and stays on head well. Made a great gift and was well received. Would recommend, as this is a good hat for the money, and doesn't look cheap.
B00JM9QZG8|5|I have had a full winter coat from free country for over 3 years now and i still use it every winter.<br /><br />This jacket is of the same quality, but is obviously not for the same weather. The interior is soft, the outer blocks wind amazingly. The zippers always work perfectly and seem very tough. the little details like the zipper cover at the top of the jacket are nice. (it holds it in place, and protects it from rubbing your chin).<br /><br />I would recommend this jacket to anyone and everyone. (as well as their winter coats)
B001NXDI6G|5|This is the perfect bra for me.  Most support bras come with \\"contour\\" padding, which I don't like.  It has 3 back hooks and very comfortable straps that don't slide off your shoulder.
B008NCYFAI|5|Not too hot, good coverage, and doesn't ride up.  I'm 5'9&#34; and 165 lbs.
B005JSYX8I|5|Perfect prop for tin man Halloween or stage production. My daughter was in the play and it was just the thing
B0038OLVI0|5|Size was true. Quality of the pants is excellent for the price. The waist band has a bit of play in it , which helps if you are in between sizes, or even if you eat a really big meal. They are lined. The only difference that I see between these and trousers that I have that are 3x the price is the thickness of the material.
B00R6X0FRM|3|There nice but they feel like dress socks
B00LFWNAPE|1|Too short and too big in bust area.
B00A3G977S|5|Great brand...different than the others...I think this one is made as real 501 materials!!! hope you have more 501 made from this material
B00OCKZZUY|2|After washing jacket for the first time the head of the teddy bear fell off. Apparently it was glued to the jacket!!! Had to sew it up. Sleeves of the jacket also too long!
B00GWUT00I|5|LOVED IT FOR A &#34;GO TO&#34; DRESS.
B00EF42334|5|My mom says that she loves the shirt and this seems like a cool company.
B00EVAXKMU|5|Awesome vans shirt.. Original price is $23.99, definitely worth getting!
B00KBB93YM|4|These are tank tops.  They shrink.  I don't think there is a perfect tank out there.
B00FMMVS4I|5|Nice!
B00JL6XUKG|5|Bought this for my grandaughter who loves Hello Kitty anything and when she was given this dress for school she loved it! Dress is alittle big but only in length. Very nice! Thank you
B00FS8PJEQ|5|always good
B00PC06X7C|5|much nicer than expected nice and soft material very happy with this product
B0068EDHBQ|5|This belt is so very cute.  It is a bit darker than is shown in the picture but I am still very happy with it.  all the cuteness of a corset without the uncomfort.
B00G28G8U0|5|I purchase god one of the gift for my daughter's baby shower. The owl on items is what's on style now.
B00L62UJ20|3|For an XXL I am a tall guy and its to short, will have to return or give to my brother
B00AZIGM1I|5|This is very pretty outfit. It has some bling to it. Top can be worn by itself or with pants.
B013J9RCYA|5|I got this shirt for my husband and he loves it. No I am not just saying that because I am his wife...lol.<br /><br />He loves how he shirt fits and how soft it is. We have noticed that the more we wash it the softer it gets, which is great. There has been very little shrinkage and bleeding. The shirt still looks as if it is brand new!<br /><br />**I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. All opinion are my own and were not influenced by getting the product for free.**
B004RBXBYK|5|Nice product.  really makes my tool stand out and be noticed, even when soft. Both colors are very nice.  Even my women friends think they look so hot , on
B006ZIG2P8|5|Definitely the best shorts I have purchased for a long time.  Length is perfect for more mature adults and the material is very comfortable.  I have had many positive comments about these shorts.
B00J30IFL4|5|My son is CPD. He loved it.
B008FMS78C|5|When it arrived I thought it was going to be way too big, but it was perfect.  It's sad that at this age they'll never be able to fit into these seasonal things again, but it will be a great hand me down!
B009EQVIMK|4|Good quality, fits well, price was right,service was quick and easy. What more can you say about a pair of jeans
B004SO74SA|5|This backpack/luggage is cuter than the picture.  Well constructed.  Just perfect for the two year   old I purchased it for.  In fact it is just the right   size for children up to at least four/five years old.  It was one of the cuter items I bought this year for  the kids. Mother and daughter love it. Received this item within  a few days of ordering it, fast delivery.
B00EG4BDR0|5|I gave this wallet as a gift but will definitely buy one for myself. The leather is so shiny and textured that it seems like sequins. Plus it arrived before expected.
B00HWOBT7K|1|Dear Guys,<br /><br />please don`t buy these pants because instead of TH, you will get worn Elvin  Park boxers. This is big FAKE, and people who makes this are not honest ones. Please save your nerves and money don`t play this game.
B00GOMDKBO|1|Steer clear if you're size 9 and above. They say fits sizes 9 to 11, but I couldn't stand to wear these more than an hour. They are ungodly tight in the ankle and the most uncomfortable thing I've ever had on my feet (including 5 inch heels). If you value blood flow to your appendages don't buy these.
B00VF0RBVK|5|Pleased with merchandise. Product as described.
B001GN61US|5|I would buy many if you had in my size 2X: CAV-O Women's V-neck Crop top Camisole. Mary Slingerland mslinger2@gmail.com
B00AW39GIW|4|I purchased this jacket in 18 month size for my not quite 9 month old as he fits into 12 month clothes now. It's definitely a bit big in the sleeves,  I think it's an appropriate fit for the size.  It seems like it will be a good  jacket for fall into early winter and I hope will still fit him in early Spring! Love the color and after two washings the fleece is still soft and hasn't pilled.
B0008EOEW8|1|collects dust and changes colour - had to throw it !!
B008Q0E61U|5|I didn't want to spend a lot on tie bars since I don't wear ties very often (and I don't want to pay engagement-ring prices for essentially a metal clothespin), and these fit the bill nicely. They look great in person (check out my uploaded photos), definitely recommend.
B007OSK2YA|4|Good quality, sturdy fabric.
B003JH8STQ|4|This is for a Disco themed party.  Looks good and fits well.
B003Z6PDZI|4|I bought one just like this at Belk's and had the same issue with the money edges protruding above the top edge of wallet.  I tried to pull the money clip down just a bit as there was room, but it was GLUED in place.<br />Such a shame that just a tiny adjustment before the manufacturer gluing it would make such a difference in the usefulness.<br />Inside pockets hold max 2 cards each.  Overall design is great.
B003TA3398|5|Adorable, Good quality costume!
B0056X51F0|5|They do run big like others have said. I took their advice and ordered one size smaller. They fit perfect. Super comfy. I ordered another pair in a different color. Glad I found these jeans, and at a great price too.
B0000WL5HA|5|Son very happy. Color desired and fit is perfect. Ability to move and function is a plus when working outside during winter months.
B004P87ZPQ|5|Love it! Super comfy and great support in the bust. Smooth and gives enough control to give you a smooth silhouette.
B00LV6QZU6|5|Exactly what was needed.
B00800AG9C|1|I would have ordered this belt but I want one 2\\" wide and this belt does not give the width at all.<br />How can one hope to sell a product when you leave half of the description out?<br />The Danbury Work Wear Men's double Prong Belt.[[ASIN:B00800AG9C Danbury Work Wear Men's Big Double Prong Belt]]
B00UGK4IY8|5|I loved this dress!  Fits great!  The material is very comfortable too!  Great buy!  I will definitely purchase more Ever Pretty dresses!
B00KS15VSM|4|Maiden form bodybriefer is a great addition to my wardrobe. You can wear your own matching bra and it does not feel a difference it is seperate. It was nice and flexible except that I could have chosen a large size. It felt thin and wear your shirt or top. It completely smooth in the tummy area and was able to wear my pants. This is my first time buying a shapewear and it was good. Try to read through the size carefully before ordering for one.
B007QYZUUS|5|It's a really good shirt, just as described, if the fabric would've been a little bit thicker just to fit the design, it'd have been so much better, however, it didn't give me any reason for not giving 5 stars.<br />I'll definitely be buying more clothes from this line.
B00J3NKHOE|5|Just received my bra today and can already tell its exactly what i needed!! Its true to color and style and the large fits my 36AA chest just perfect. Doesn't smush them but still holds them in place while allowing some cleavage to be seen:) Also like the fact i can change it into a racer bra!! This is my 5th very stylish sports bra from them,, haven't needed to take any of them back. I also LOVE their pants for my Circuit Training. LOVE IT so far!!
B008FHUOXI|4|The color and shape of dress are very nice.<br />But this type of sleeve dosen't go well with my arms.
B00OTRVVVW|5|ok excelente producto
B000O9VH8G|5|I love the shirt, fit is good, could be a little larger if you like a really loose fit though.  I suggest if you want as a layering shirt and you wear a medium size to get an extra large!  But, it's soft and comfy, and it really like it anyway, not so small that I need to return it.
B002IRIHRG|4|Great style, but way to big.  Size states it fits size 14-18.<br />Otherwise it is a nice costume, not cheaply made.
B00EV2LO1M|3|I love this dress, But, but it's way to long., and it's , thin, but I do like. I got two! But I send one back!;)
B00FAX6DAS|5|My granddaughter was thrilled with the dress I couldn't get her out of it! She will get her use out of it.
B006ZUO5PK|3|The picture is much prettier than the image. You will need a VERY good strapless bra and you may need to line the top as it's very sheer. You can actually see the elastic through the fabric. With all that said, the price is a really good. If you're willing to do a little work, you may have something really great. Take time to measure yourself and compare with the size chart.
B003U2TD5I|4|For reference: I am 5'6, 170, measurements are 40-35-38. This costume is amazing, & exceeds my expectations! The length was a few inches too long to show off my cute witchy boots, so I hemmed it up 3 inches. The belt is attached at the sides of the dress & does not go around the back, so it looks kinda strange - wish it was just separate. The hat is also super floppy, not sure what I'm going to do about that! But overall, its an awesome costume - pretty, fun, flattering & sexy without being skanky!<br /><br />[edit] I wore this costume to work & taking my son trick or treating & received sooo many compliments! Awesome costume, it held up great & was quite comfy.
B0089GJ3Z0|4|The fit is great except the sleeves are a full 2inches too long for me. Currently cuffed, I may hem. A spring/ fall weight versatile item and the styling is more &#34;stylish&#34; than most. I usually wear an 8 and got the medium as the size chart suggested. The Zing color is cheerful and wakes up my neutrals.
B00IWJBKSC|3|Top was a little too small for me the bottoms fix  tho
B00OH6MGO6|5|Great conversation starter.
B0018PC252|5|Ty
B0032AMW0G|1|Very stiff large and poor quality! Returning
B00KOGNUN4|4|It's one of my favorite shirts
B00GGECVH4|5|This is a perfect fitting dress, is made with good material feels soft and it made with good quality material will be a long lasting dress will wash good hangs good
B00062NPDG|4|I lost a beloved identical jacket in a different color that is no longer available in my size, so I went with this blue. It is exactly like my other jacket (nice slim fit, warm but not hot, etc.) except the color is a much brighter blue than I expected from the screen image. Almost too bright for my taste. I'll have to get used to standing out in a crowd, I guess.
B00GWEQ3MW|1|II bought a Fire Dragon  and received a raccoon. To bad because is for my daughter she has 11 years old.
B006W1UVSW|5|Love this summer dress, the colors are great and the fit is perfect.  Can't wait to wear it Saturday for my backyard BBQ!!!
B00K1F3UQA|3|My Daughter loved it
B00HSCYTDW|4|Fit like a glove !!! I loved it.
B00EEZOPLM|5|This skirt is great. I love it and know I will wear it often. I am 5'3&#34; and about 120 and the small is perfect.
B001A3VWNU|3|I have mixed feelings about this product.  Like why are products for women often less qualitative than what they make for men?  It is good leather, the design is as pictured, BUT...if you load up the picture sleeve, put 4 credit cards in the cc holder, put a few bills in the billfold area you are more likely to survive being an Ice Cube in hell than having any success making the snaps meet up so you can properly close the wallet.  Best I can do is put a thick, pink rubber band around it.<br /><br />The chain is good, but the leather belt loop is not optional and not all women wear wide belts.  The quality of the chain is very good, but the clip at the end that attaches it to the wallet is thin wimpy metal that I have to keep bending back into shape to keep it from falling off the wallet eyelet AND the chain is too short.  You pull the wallet out of your pocket and barely have enough length of chain to handle the wallet without fumbling it.<br /><br />Based on quality issues, I should have sent it back.  I also should give it fewer stars, but I like the look and feel of it.  I keep a tight rubber band around it and I am hoping the leather will relax with time like shoes do and I can make the snaps meet.  I also plan to pick up a sturdy chain clip at the hardware store. If you are looking for \\"as depicted\\" ready to use perfection  you might want to pass on this item
B00CMEDCF2|4|Now, the N7 leather jacket was a bit too good to be true when I first laid eyes upon the product, but after receiving and wearing for a couple of hours, all doubts were laid to rest.<br />This jacket is not only good for cosplay, but great to wear around anywhere, I have already have 5 compliments on the new jacket.<br />GREAT BUY FOR ANYONE
B00551OP0A|4|This is a beautiful bra but I thought it was a bra with extra padding which I could use, and though it was nicely lined, it did not have the padding, so I was not sure if I should keep it because of this, or if I should seek some kind of extra padding to insert.  In the write up it was unclear to me, and I mistook what they said.  So, picking up something from a picture, and not having it in your hand to see, I think is not for me to do as it is too much of a risk and trouble to return etc. Can one return undergarments like this?  Are you given credit w/Amazon or refunded the money?
B00D8Z8HE0|1|I returned it, but to refund me my money was a problem
B0097DHHPW|5|The dress fits perfectly and really was beautiful!  It was a tad expensive but compared to others that were cheaper, it was superior.
B00GLW6KY6|5|They feel great and look great I love these jeans. The size is exact and the fit is great. Awesome jeans
B00EDHVV6I|5|I've had the shirt for a year. I wear it a lot, it washes well, and looks as crisp as if had been washed only once. If you have a somewhat large waist for your size, order a size up. Otherwise, sleeve length is perfect for my lanky arms. The shirt garners lots of compliments when I wear it.
B006TAEBDC|1|This was skin tight.
B00FMKHJ6G|3|This belt is smaller than the size indicates and it looks like it will crack after just a little use.
B00TUTXGMG|5|Great product.
B00NVMSET8|5|Nice colors, it was a gift and she loved it.  Quality as expected and happy with purchase
B006FDFJDO|5|Excelente calidad y entrega en tiempo y forma lo acordado. Muchas gracias por todo. Esperamos volver a comprar muy pronto.lo recomendamos
B005SHWSF0|5|sexy and hot<br />very good feel and fit<br />makes you feel good<br />good price and worth buying<br />what else is there to say
B00W2TG09W|5|Gave it 4 stars since haven't tried it on yet.  Looks different from what you can get locally and planning to wear it for our granddaughter 's Florida graduation.now have worn it and give 5 stars. Sooo comfortable
B00D7VQBUC|1|I wish we had read the reviews before purchasing.  This are a Joke!!!!  I wouldn't even give it a 1 star but that is the lowest I can go.
B00946JU6G|5|My son picked this out for himself. Great quality,colors true to picture and fits great!
B00DQZ5CLI|3|Frankly, I was slightly disappointed on how light it was. Not that light is bad but I was expecting something more substantial.
B003TL5TYY|5|Just order 1 size smaller as a friendly suggestion.  Kindof sized a bit large.
B0051D4SYA|5|I ordered these jeans because I love the fit and quality of the Lee relaxed fit jeans.  I ordered a larger size then I normally wear, so they would be comfortable while working in my garden, yard and around the house!  I am not disappointed, they are great and have just enough stretch in them.  I would have liked to order a darker color, not available at the time.  I have found that they are a lighter weight denim, so they are cool in warmer weather and heavier work!  They arrived in just a few days and have no complaints about the customer service!  They come out of the laundry great!
B00O5ATLFG|4|Nice shirt , good price.
B00IBILO62|5|Like these a lot.  Fabric has an odd odor but not overpowering.
B00LA3KD8A|5|Amazing design, fits to waist, no muffin top.
B00WB1RM52|5|Love the fit, like the material.
B00IKCMPPI|5|Good
B00JO2UP8W|5|Perfect fit, love it! I am 5'6&#34;, and 175 pounds, i wear a size 12 and this fit very well. It is very stretchy and will fit the body well. It would be great for cold nights.
B00BF2YEKY|5|I ordered this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! He gets compliments on it all the time!
B00CAI71H0|5|Very satisfied with the color and texture of the material + sizing fits totally !<br />I love this cutting and hope CK can have more shorts of this type !
B00MLWBXH4|2|The skirt is beautiful and looks just like the picture. What I specifically like about it, is the fact that it is NOT see through which is something that I was searching day and night on amazon. The material is of great quality! It is NOT lightweight yet not exactly heavy either. Its actually comfortable  and alright for summer use. However, I HATE how the skirt is EXTREMELY Long to the point that it drags against the floor. I tried to fold it and it still was too long! Even when I tried to fold it, I did not like the bulge that it would leave as it became a problem when I would wear a shirt. I tried to wear it with a crop top but it still looked weird because of the folding as it is too wide. I payed a bit extra for this &#34;X-Small&#34; size and it was still TOO LONG. Truly left Me devastated. I Am 5'3 and 118lbs. I would have to wear really high shoes for this skirt to look half decent which sucks as I wanted to wear this with comfy flats for everyday school use. It honestly looks a bit better as a maxi dress on Me. Due to all this I have mixed reviews and yet am devastated as mentioned before. I guess if you're on the shorter size don't buy it. If you're a very tall woman 5'7 or taller, then I'd say maybe this skirt is for you.
B00PWTJ6ZO|5|Pretty dress.  Nice bright sunshiney yellow.  Came right away.
B003HC8RVC|5|Gold toe socks are more expensive but  I've never had a bad sock or one that has come apart. The multi pack is a good deal with enough color differences to suit nearly anything worn.
B00LRWJJHK|5|Really like the light nature of the fabric and the bright colors
B00D2TSZ12|5|Beautiful pants!  BUT, the pair I got labelled size 4 was at least a size 12.  Just plain mis-marked.  I returned them.  I would have gladly exchanged them for a true size 4, but I was not offered that option and I couldn't figure out how to find someone to ask.
B001BRC5HM|5|Love these undies; they are the least panty-line underwear I've ever liked wearing. The model's pic in the add is scary but they fit us usual people!
B00HVHKWEE|5|It's a good quality hat, wanted the slouchy look for my daughter, that's what she got. Would order from this retailer again!
B0038ASLA0|5|The material is soft, print is authentic. Bought the small; the fit is excellent, however the shoulder width was just a tad too small [bought to fit a semi-muscular guy though]. Jersey was fitted, but not tight. The length was just right. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase =). Hope this helps!
B00AINQCKG|3|The page says one size fits all. This isn't true. I wear a size 10 men's shoe, and while the sock is usuable, it is just barely so. It is too big.  It is nice looking, however, and it is very thin, which might be good or bad according to your preferences.
B000KZLMM0|5|This is the absolutely best hat ever!  It looks good on everyone.  I do not even own the hat.  It is my sister's which she got from someone in Honduras.  I really want to buy one because she is making me give it back.
B0059H39U2|5|These socks are as thin as a liner sock but don't require the second sock.  I swear by these now I use them for back country, day hikes, and front country.  Once you hike in these you won't want to go back to traditional socks again.
B00PA7V8NG|5|Lovely colors and the alligator clip stays put in fine hair.
B00GTW0XAA|5|Desigual coats are tastefully fun & full OD style - I have 7 Desigual coats & none of them look anything like each other & the fit is always perfect!!
B00D31BRNM|5|Very happy with this purchase. Nice classic design--holds up as well as anything off the rack at a worlds-more expensive store. Comfortable in the summer.
B00JEXL4BI|3|Good colored socks, soft to wear.  They aren't standing up to washing real well.  There is already some pilling.
B00OGOR0KE|5|COMFY!!!!!!!!! That's all you need to know :) o..... And really long I'm 5'7 and these are a good 2 inches longer than my legs, but I don't care, why? COMFY!!!!
B00EZMCEGC|5|Great jacket ... A classic that I will wear for years!
B00FYEW26C|3|The top was alright but the<br />Pants a<br />Little tight in the waste.  I kept them and they stretch out through out the day.  All in all a good deal.  Thank you...
B00KGGE4BY|5|Wife loves them, and will be ordering more when color selection is replenished.
B00JQ1OXZW|5|A very well made, good product at a great price.  Arrived quickly and the gift recipient was very happy with it.  Would definitely purchase from this sell again.
B00C7X99XM|5|I get amazing compliments! Beautiful, fits well, and very flattering on my size 14-16 figure!
B0018T2B40|1|My size is 5L. This is my second time to order this type pants.  The pants label indicates 5L, however, it is 4cm shorter than what I ordered previous one.
B002R0FH04|2|The Large size is smaller than other leotards I've ordered for my daughter.
B001CQ04QQ|5|My husband had given me a frog ring years ago and I always felt bad because it slipped off my finger and was gone forever.  I always looked for one that was similar but never found one.  I saw this ring and fell in love with it.  I showed it to my husband and ordered it that very night.  It was even better looking in person than pictured.  I showed it to my co-workers and some thought it was much more expensive than what I had paid. If you are looking for an expensive looking ring without paying the high price, this is the one for you.<br />It came on time and exactly as I had ordered.  Would recommend this item and seller to anyone.
B00F3IDC36|3|I bought these leggings and loved them at first, but they fell apart in two washes. I hadn't been using them for exercise or strenuous activity.
B00EPBURQW|3|I usually love the pj's from Carol Hochman.  However, this pair runs quite large and began fading the first time I washed them.  Normally Carol Hochman pajamas run true to size and wash very well.  I think  these have a different fabric content.  They are very soft and comfortable.
B00485BE8K|4|I like how the inside of the material gribs you so it does not slide down easy.  No wires; thank God. And, I like how it goes all the way up under my breast for full body support.<br /><br />Thanks Dr. Shapewear.
B00KMKWQN2|1|Not sure what's going on in that pic but I received a dress that only goes down to my knees
B00AYYGDEY|5|IF YOU WEAR A MED GO TO A LARGE..THEY ARE NOT TRUE TO SIZE..VERY SOFT AND COMFORTABLE LOVE IT .
B0051D8K80|4|The jeans were exactly as described.  Good quality: durable and well made.  Good, comfortable fit.  Will most likely buy again.
B001JBF7UM|5|Perfect fit. Good quality. Will buy again.
B005GQ4XDI|4|They fit all over except they are too full just below the waist around the tummy area.  This makes them stick out too much around the pockets.I'm 5'4&#34; and I like the length just as picture shows.
B00DT2AATW|5|thank you
B00IJU97P2|5|Perfect fit, comfortable material, I love it
B0081CVZ5I|5|Amazon rocks as far as delivery goes, I ordered it on a Sunday and it was here by Tuesday!.  The reviews on this item were really helpful as I bought a large and it fits comfortably. I haven't actually worn it yet so that will have to be on a later comment, but I tried it on and love it.
B001BOJWWQ|5|Very good fabric.
B0063OP74Q|4|Well-made bathing suit - adorable in person. The colors are slightly muted compared to what you see online, but it doesn't distract in any way from the cuteness of it. Only complaint I have is that it runs about 1-2 sizes too big. My daughter wears a 4 sometimes a 5. I bought a 5 first. It was way too big, but it fit her 7 year old friend perfectly. So I ordered a size 4. While that size fits slightly better - it's still just too big. I think the 3T would've been a better fit, but I'm not ordering another one!
B00I84EPZG|5|This product was exactly what I was looking for, a well constructed, compact wallet to last me for years.
B001GK0EZY|4|Nice hat.  Wider than expected brim, not quite sombrero but definitely not teenage hipster skinny brim. Hat band... well, my experience of anything advertised as &#34;genuine&#34; leather on Amazon generally means genuine synthetic polyurethane (PU) leather, and sure enough, the band is indeed synthetic.  Not a deal breaker.  Size, as warned, is also inaccurate, my extra large head fit the Large size hat I ordered perfectly.  Be forewarned and you will be happy with it.
B008LKH3IS|3|Sizing was very small. Ordered a 4xl and it fit like a 2xl.  Gave them a 3 star as it was nice and the return went smooth.
B00FC1ASDG|5|Love them! Don't fall (work) down with jeans on.
B0071MEO9I|3|Somewhat uncomfortable
B00DY0ZZ44|2|I had to give it away to my daughter as it didn't fit. I bought a medium but it smashed my breasts and I couldn't wear it.
B00H9584WU|5|Great fit, attractive price, nice colors, materials are great
B00EFQKKVE|2|i knew they would run small but this is crazy small. I really like the shorts but I wish they would post their actually sizes for this brand. Gave them to a friend and she loved them.
B00QF6BHT6|5|This thing is awesome. Not only does it look totally bad ass but its so easy to use. I'm forever digging in my purse for my cards and wallet. Now I just pull this out and all of my cards are right there and I can put it right back in the slot.
B000BKET1K|5|I am an airline pilot so this has been getting very regular use for about 2 years. All I can say is it's great. A much preferable alternative to using the coffee pot in hotel rooms to make tea. Also great for heating water for soup. I highly recommend it to frequent travellers. You need to clean it with a bit of vinegar every so often to dissolve scale build up, other than that no problems.
B009BRJSII|1|This wig was very poor quality!  I payed for 2 day shipping to get it on time for Halloween and the quality was so cheap I had to go to my local Halloween store to get a different wig.
B00J7KUXY2|3|Pretty but too small and not that good quality
B00DYFEA40|4|It's ok
B00J59U45S|5|One was sent back . Different fabric than what was listed . The navy was a nice fit . Wear 12-14 . A medium fit well
B00KQFKTQY|5|Love these shirts and wear them all the time--around the house on a daily basis, working outside, etc.  I wear the long-sleeve style as an undershirt during the winter to help keep me warm.
B00B70GLAK|3|Seems to work as expected.  ..
B007R0PGT6|5|These pants are really nice. Not only are they incredibly comfortable, but they fit very well. It looks very fashionable too, I will definitely be buying some more of these for work. I bought a medium and regularly wear 32x32 jeans (which can vary a lot from store to store), and they fit perfect.
B007PSE402|5|These PJ's are very soft and comfortable.  They are heavy weight and I expect them to last a long time.  I am in between petite and regular leg length so I have a hard time finding PJ's that aren't too long.  These are perfect.  I would highly recommend these.
B003C3ZNGI|5|Husband wore this to a 70's themed dance. It was LOUD and memorable (the costume that is). He added a large gold chain with a large medallion on it, along with some white platform shoes, and it looked complete. The material was thicker than expected (a bonus) and has held up to a night of groovy disco dancing and the trip through the washing machine and dryer.
B00EOY7F74|5|These gloves make me feel like a total bad ass whenever i smoke cigarettes in public. They're like warm and functional too i guess.
B002DZIJHG|4|this is one of my favorite hats in my collection. and for the price you can't beat the deal. Made of quality materials.
B006EKJECK|4|I really like the look of this shirt, but I washed it one time and the design faded. Maybe I didn't wash it correctly.
B0018T8IGA|5|The most comfy jeans I have ever bought and for a reasonable price. I bought a 3-short because I am not tall and the length fits perfectly to my short legs. I would definitely recommend those jeans
B00IUTGGG0|4|The finger loop on one of the gloves had to be sewn but a nice product overall
B00N2FYMDQ|5|I have been looking for a waist cincher for awhile. I have received recommendations from friends and family, however, I wasn't too keen on the prices as I didn't want to pay a lot for something I was unsure that I would even like. I went searching on Amazon, and came across the Shymay Women's Workout Waist Cincher. It fit perfect. It did not bunch up when I would move which was a main concern. It was very comfortable and the fabric was durable and well made.    I love how it fit with my body. The waist cincher formed with my body which is nice instead of something making you look larger than you really are. It highlighted the good and hid from the bad. The pattern is very feminine. I like that it is easy to put on and take off. Very easy to keep clean. Wear it at home or out for gatherings. This will have you feeling great about your body.    Perfect for a wife, girlfriend, or bridal gift. I would even recommend it as a just because gift. Or order for yourself. It is worth it.
B00GNWZM2A|5|I found this after being dissatisfied with other popular brands. It has a little foam but not heavily padded with memory foam so it's not hot in the summer. I was very happy as the straps don't constantly fall down. They for the most part stay up. The fit is perfect.
B0082IOWYW|5|I bought this item for my Lady Bane cosplay costume, and it turned out to be perfect for the outfit. It looks perfect and it was quick/efficient service.
B001O9TIH2|2|Hi,  I bought this cover for my daughter.  She loved it BUT some of the diamonds came out within a couple of days.    I also paid for express shipping and it took over a week to get here.
B00FDQBV40|5|My son loves this
B00H1NMU20|3|Color not quite Charcoal, more Taupe.  I do have clothes that match so it is fine - was just looking for a dark grey.
B000V9ZV90|4|nice color but returned for a shirt with a longer hemline
B00DHD7N3Y|5|I get so many compliments on this shirt ! Definitely worth the buy
B008VPS5VM|5|My husband loves them. Soft and comfortable and keeps him warm without holding in sweat. So much better than the flannel ones.
B00G364FPQ|2|For a winter coat it was cut very narrow. I was surprised at the light weight of the garment. Overall, had it fit, I would have kept it. Yet for the money I was not impressed with the sizing or weight.
B0050T49O4|4|Was a little leery to purchase a robe that I couldn't feel first...texture is important for a super comfy robe!  The fact that it wasn't terrycloth worried me also.  However, I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday and he LOVES it.  It is SUPER soft, warm, a beautiful red wine color, and has a nice color-on-color chevron pattern all over.  I feel like he could wear it with an ascot and look quite dapper :)  He's 6'1\\" with broad shoulders and the L/XL fits him just fine.<br /><br />Only thing I would change is maybe make it 12\\" or so longer, but this is just personal preference.  The pictures clearly show the length, so I knew it would be a little below knee-length -- no surprises.  I prefer ankle-length for warmth, but it can make you look like a bit of a wizard.  Again, boyfriend thought it was PERFECT.<br /><br />This is just what my boyfriend wanted, and I was so happy when he tried it on and was so pleased with it.  He would probably give 5 stars.  It is GREAT quality, especially for a $40 robe!  If he wasn't such a minimalist when it comes to clothing, I probably would have bought him one in every color.
B00JX4Q3LO|4|Got this shirt for a bowling competition coming up and fits perfectly!
B00LMI9A6Y|3|Got is good but not lined with fleece. Is made with a pretty good Lycra spandex mix. Very stretchy.
B003LO1WQI|4|I'm actually wearing them right now. They fit great. I do wish the pockets were a little deeper in the front, or made from a loser material like cloth. I can see losing things when I transition from stand up to sit down.<br /><br />They have a rougher feel, like it sets an expectation that these pants will last a long time. I hope so!
B003X26SB2|5|My husband will only wear braided belts and this is well made.  I'm hoping it lasts longer than the other brand he purchased.  It's very attractive and fits well.  I even bought him the matching wallet.
B009LEA89O|1|I keep getting bigger sizes and it never works out. I don't purchase clothes online without reading reviews. After having purchased over 10 shirts of eVogues (many which were returned) I have come to this conclusion- If 3 or more people say you have to go up in size, it is because it is just too short. Going up in size will not make it much better. If you wear your pants to your belly button then you will be okay with the &#34;too small&#34; shirts...as long as you don't plan to raise an arm. I bought larger in this one via reviews and still too short. I have a 2 sizes larger one in my closet that is still too short.
B00HX49ZDY|5|Nice socks! And a good price!
B00K5TH5Q8|4|Great product, fits well, absorbs sweat at a great price.
B00HIENLWK|5|I ordered my standard size of 7's (27) fit perfect!  The stretchy material is nice (not complete denim).  I am 5'5 125 and 33-27-34... These fit like regular skinnys on me, not crops... Happy with the price, fit, quality, and not having to tailor them!
B0068KA6R8|4|I think the high quality of the fabric and boot-leg cut of this item makes it fall more in the category of jeans or pants, not leggings. Regardless, the 4P, my usual size (I'm 5'3\\" and 105-110 pounds) was too big and the 2P is not available. So I'm back to looking for what I consider to be leggings, more like these: [[ASIN:B0035WTSMG Anne Klein Women's Cotton Leggings]].
B0031IFMRE|5|Haven't worn them out yet, but they seem pretty sturdy. I have pretty big thighs but they fit me just fine.
B00501ANLK|5|Based on some of the other reviews, I was worried about the design being off-center, but when I received the shirt it lookd great. I bought it for my boyfriend's birthday and it fits him well and he loved it.
B008G0TLL0|3|Good Quality and material for a jersey. Didnt know how the fit was going to be, wish I would have gotten a smaller size.
B002M47ERY|1|Opened this package after time for refund is passed. This wallet looks like it was put together by a child.  Everything is ineven.  Spend a few more dollars and get a real wallet.  Also the leather smells bad.
B00CXM8VEA|2|SMALL!! I'm a medium, and it's way to small :( it's so cute, maybe an XL would fit like a M....
B004MKLOJK|4|haggard is not what it once was, but if you watch the material you will be okay. I have worn Haggar for 20 years
B00KGRZK6Q|5|Son ideales.
B003P0XPHC|4|Good quality of course. It's a Pendlton. I bought this for my 34 year old son. He said to me, \\"Gee dad, I like it. I'm going to start wearing more things like this.\\" It looks great on him.
B00MNHV1BK|3|Too small
B0036GBF18|5|Fit was correct.  Seems rugged enough to last and meets my expectations.  It feels comfortable and has plenty of pockets for my needs.
B00AZSZMJ6|5|This outfit is super cute and even more cute in person. The price was a little higher than I usually pay for things after shipping is included (I'm cheap). But it was worth the purchase.
B001D6CQG6|5|Nice work pants for a great price.
B00BU8ZEO8|5|I bought these to help me not have to do laundry every other day so I had my favorite gym pants, which are very similar and were 3X as much.  These are just as comfy and fit great!
B005XLTH32|2|This is too large
B00NZ8L9K4|2|It says it's for the upper arm but it barely fit around my wrist. It arrived in it's packaging bent- luckily I have jewelry making stuff so I was able to straighten it out. It's not bad as a super cheap, lower wrist bracelet, but it is not as advertised.
B00KGPC99Y|4|bends easily
B00U9ZPDGC|5|Love this little jacket! I looks great with everything and adds the finishing touch to complete a perfect outfit! Fits great, great material, good quality, shipped fast, everything I expected! Looks exactly like the pictures shown. Love it. I recommend!
B007RB7KKI|5|Fits me beautifully!  Very elegant and sexy!
B007T994LG|5|I'm only 17 weeks but I wear it every day and love it. I think it will work great when I get bigger too. If not I will update my rating. Love it!
B00JM6JHS4|5|Nice hat and not cheap. Looks and feels great.^5
B00D65Q6EA|4|This dress is small so make sure you order one size up is small and fitted so if you have a little belly  go up one size.
B003W04XJ4|5|fits great, just what I was looking for!
B00SPL962Y|5|I absolutely loved the dress, but it was too big. That was mostly my fault, I try to order a bigger size thinking it would run small. Great fabric and adorable dress, just too big.  I'd order again from this shipper! I did end up returning the dress because of the size, they were very kind and quick with the refund.<br />Thank you!
B00AOMYSK2|1|Super crappy quality. The stitch work is bad and they feel as if they'll rip if I sit down. They were way too long and over baggy in the thighs as well.
B008MA3FVG|5|I usually dont like such feminine styled panties, and I was afraid that these would be uncomfortable, but I have to say, wow am I surprised.  These feel amazing to wear, and they are so light weight and barely there that they are truely something to experience.  Won't your wife freak when she sees you wearing these under your jeans?  In a good way I mean.  These will definently satisfy that nagging urge for a bit of lace trim in your life.  I got a size 6 and a size 7 but with a 35/36\\" waist I found the 7 to be too loose.  a 5 or a 6 work good for me.  They are soft and breezy,and ung, erotic.
B00FFXJ4HW|5|I love this dress!! I bought the BlueBlack and I received so many compliments when I wore this along with the Shrug. The XL was a little tighter than I expected and I needed help zipping it up. If you have any &#34;extra&#34; in the bust area you may want to consider a larger size because that area fits very tightly. The next size up would have probably fit better.
B00I5UU6FG|1|Had to give it a star to rate but this was NOTHING like expected. There was NO difference in putting this on.  The padding was flat and nothing was filled out.  Butt was still flat with the feeling of a tight panty.. NOTHING like pic used. I'd have needed 8 inserts each side to have gotten anywhere the butt shown....tho I wasn't expecting to have a Kardashian butt I was expecting some kind of extra something back there......nothing. Waste of money & time!
B00F03BMNQ|5|This is a great buy! I love it and will buy another. I was a bit worried when I first got the item because the material felt kind of thick. But to my surprise, the material is so soft and very comfortable. It feels so lightweight when you put it on. It is great to wear for the warm summer nites.
B00CBEMVE6|5|Loved this jacket! Definitely gives me something that few people around me will have :) Pay attention to their sizing chart because it is accurate and something you can count on!
B00STZCW2C|4|Very nice ones and husband look nice in them
B00GMSY16I|5|I ordered this shirt for my husband and he loves it! It fit him exactly how an XXL normally does. The material is soft and the design is very vibrant. It has held up very well in the wash and hasn't shrunk either. Having the logo on the front and back of the shirt makes it look more like an official shirt that would be worn if you were in fact part of the survey corps. Overall fun shirt and great for the Attack on Titan enthusiast.<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All experiences and opinions are my own.
B00K1T0BJA|5|excelente
B008GWJ4TC|5|Black Sabbath is my all time favorite band. I bought this shirt because it looks awesome and would go good with the other Sabbath shirts I got off Amazon.
B0096Q3M72|3|This is just a cool shirt to wear if you a fan of the band and the gragpic has not worn away even after a few washes.
B00CKNQRJI|5|Because it is as good as the ad.<br />It fits ok and good fabric<br />Bye bye bye bye bye<br />Bye
B00KGFG6WK|5|Wonderful
B006NTENI2|5|This product worked even better than I expected it to...I use it all the time!! :) Definitely great a great buy!
B00BAXM1H6|4|I was looking for socks to wear to work, and these are great.  They don't slip and slide and feel comfortable in my dress boots.
B005Q8LY06|5|lovely! good value for money
B00AZ6RYW6|5|Good quality and fit
B0009GA9FQ|5|My husband loves them, wants more of them for golf.
B005W0LVBA|4|Covers your boobs!
B003I7R5QY|3|Length is perfect. 13&#34; inseam provides plenty of room. Waist size runs a little small so best to order one size up.
B007OUFS1K|5|Fits perfectly. Looks great. Want in more colors.
B00QH0N5DG|4|long and fat
B004LG0TSC|5|Very convenient for what I bought it for, being a tourist on a cruise.
B00I04OUJ0|5|I got it for my son, and love it. The only trouble is, it runs very small. My son is a small 7 month old, and he needs a size 12 months.
B009CTUBGS|4|Good, solid shorts.  It would be nice if Dockers used the same wrinkle-free fabric they use in their slacks because, seriously, who wants to iron shorts.  If you smooth them out when they come out of the dryer you can get away with it but the fabric could be better.  The cell phone pocket is a nice idea but is too small for today's smart phones.
B00LUXA2YK|1|to small
B00L87WARA|5|They fit perfectly!
B0059H21J2|3|I'm a little unsure of the market UA was going for with this product. While it's well made like most UA products, it runs big and long. If you're a bigger/well-built individual, then this will work for you. However, if you prefer a slimmer and tighter fit, then you might want to invest in a more slim fit Under Armour product (which they do indeed sell). It's also a fairly heavy jacket, so it keeps you very warm. Just don't expect a light fit that you'd commonly go running in!
B000P60RJ8|5|I bought the bag for my wife. She simply loved it. Hard to go wrong for the price. Just beware that it is a small purse.
B0053XF87O|5|It doesn't slide down and has great support, I'm In love with it, makes my clothing look smooth all day long
B005HRCSEM|2|I figured 100G was the top thickness, but i was wrong with this item, yes the item is in ok condition and it does the trick, but its not thick at all, its thin and most of the feathers fall by easy movements...I just ended up going to the downtown LA fashion district to get me real thick feather boas for a few dollars more but their were three times thicker and the feathers dont fall out.
B00DWBV89Q|5|The best pants you will ever own!  I serious live in these pants. I even wear them instead of sweat pants around the house. Incredibly stylish and comfortable. Worth every penny!!
B0034A0V3O|5|very happy with this purchase.  Oh! so easy and arrived in a very fast time. Champion is really a comfort to the feet.
B00HH0IIVO|5|As always, when I wanted a new hijab, I went to Zaffron. I have several sparkle hijabs by Al Amira and like all the others, this one is beautiful. Made of a stretchy, silky material, it is nice to wear and the silver woven into the blue, along with generous rhinestone trim really compliments my abayas or salwars and gives them just the right touch of style and glamor. You absolutely cannot go wrong with an Al Amira sparkle hijab from Zaffron!
B0012V3F8K|5|The Bella Materna Basic T-Shirt Nursing Bra is a solid, high quality, and comfortable bra. I recommend it as a basic essential for nursing mothers. I owned 3 of these bras, which I alternated over most days of the week, for about a year and half. I was very pleased with the comfort and fit of these bras! The cups retain their shape as long as they are line-dried (I laundered on the delicate cycle of my machine and they came out beautifully). After about a year, I noticed the seams on the front of the cups showed under my clothes – either due to my changing size or because the material stretched a bit. A terrific bra overall! The flexi-wires are perfectly comfortable and of high quality. Beautiful material and good support!<br /><br />I purchased the Bella Materna Basic T-Shirt Nursing Bra (with wires) and was invited to review the product for a free gift from Bella Materna.
B006ZIBRFS|5|This shirt is great.  My grandson is into Finn and Jake and loves wearing this shirt.  Good quality and price.
B00BRIAR7K|5|I have this raincoat and it is fantastic. It solves three serious problems. Problem #1: What to pack when going on a trip (to the office, to Europe, to visit your Aunt in Providence) when you are not sure what the weather will be. Problem#2: Find a coat you can take out of your briefcase, shake it out and make a nice presentation. This packable raincoat has a luxury look when you take it out, but which can stay in your briefcase or suitcase without clutter. Problem #3: What to wear when it does rain. This is the perfect solution to packing AND STAYING DRY WHEN IT DOES RAIN!! Not meant for hurricane Sandy, but definitely for the rainy or windy day you are likely to encounter.  I am thinking I should get one to keep in my car.  It covers my suit, but it is not overly long. I am a happy traveller!
B000QW6LHI|4|I gave it four stars not because of the product but because I have a smaller waist than I thought.<br />It fit a little looser than I expected, however, it is very comfortable. I will order another in Large size, since it provides great support for my<br />lower back as well as my waistline.<br />I would recommend to a friend.
B011C0F9YI|5|Very flattering! Maybe a bit warm for a hot summer day (as it is 90% cotton) but the quality is very good. Fits great too!
B00IVSTTBE|5|Looks better in person.
B00SUZPT1C|2|I orderd a large because I am a medium and wanted to make sure it fit, the large fits like a small so it does not fit me
B002XYA1A0|5|Light weight, roomy. Strap hold down my GPS. Enough room to hold. I can also clip the case to the bag. Good Price, and I love it.
B00E8HDIPU|4|It's amazing! So cute. In most sizes my son is just now fitting in 12 month so I thought this would be huge on him, well it fits him perfect, a little worried if won't fit in a few months
B0034G65OC|5|These panties are good quality, finally! I am always buying these kinds and they rip up after I wash or dry them, and these have withstood and done well!! I am really happy that I found a product that actually isnt crap!<br />I will say though, the designs that I got on the panties are a little childish, zebra stripes and polka dots. Which really doesn't matter, but if you're worried about it then check the designs and see if you can change it.
B00DVKNL70|4|Got these for my grandson who loved them.  But I should have got them a size up.  Especially the top which just fit him.  So my suggestion is to go a size up than you would normally get.
B00DN1CNN0|4|Gave this as part of a chef's gift pack for my son at Christmas. Jacket, bottle of wine, cheeses and a gift certificate to his favorite butcher seemed to make him happy and I will get to be the lucky person who benefits from his delicious meals.
B00CTGBT62|5|I LOVE THE MATERIAL AND GREAT PRICE VERY ELEGANT<br />my daughter like it also<br />great brand and colors too :)
B00KNTIZFA|5|I wear this all the time in the winter. It does have a smell to it that washing doesn't get rid of though.
B00IJJHC64|5|Perfect to my 7month baby girl
B00OK31Y08|4|It was delivered on time. It fits as expected.
B00E4GMO14|5|Fits well. True to size. Looks good. I wish the fabric was of a higher quality, it would have made it perfect!
B00CCP03AS|5|love it! great bathing suit. Luckily I never read reviews because asia and china sizes run small but i still always get small, and these are so perfect.,
B00EUT4S6E|5|great. I have thrown out all my old plastic stays.  Delivered quickly. A great e
B0054Y5WUA|5|As I have swelling in my ankles, these fit nicely, especially at this price.
B00P2VJOUE|5|Very pretty
B00LE3EKR6|4|I wear a 16 and the 2x is to small. Love it so hitting the gym
B002ZO1N0K|5|This is the last wallet I'll ever have to buy.  It's stiff at first, but it's been softening up.  I can't see it ever really wearing out.  This is the wallet I've been looking for for years.
B00EEGK54M|5|These boardshorts fit well and have a zippered fly and pockets. The size is true to the standard. The fabric is comfortable for all day wearing.
B00GOKJI7G|1|for large they are tight. have a hard time getting them on.
B001YHN30C|3|I'm an independent contractor to the oil and gas industry and was recently required to adopt Flame Resistant clothing.  I ordered shirts and pants from several different manufacturers.  I love the Carhartt FR jacket and vest.  This is a decent quality Henley, but insanely overpriced.  Nowhere near the detail of a standard, button front work shirt, but ten bucks more expensive.
B006FCNW48|5|I got this t-shirt as a Christmas present along with a couple other similar style shirts. It looked great, the quality is definitely what I was hoping for when I saw the price and it arrived quickly to boot. All in all I am a happy customer!
B005MRP59W|2|For $12 its a decent thermal.  It's not really very warm and its made pretty cheaply.  I wasnt expecting Carhartt quality when i purchased this for only $12 but i also wasnt expecting a size XL to fit like a Medium either.  Its a cheap thermal shirt & if you are thinking about ordering one make sure that you buy it about 2 sizes bigger than your normal size.
B0031QANAW|5|i searched everywhere to find ladies cotton handkerchiefs.  here i found so many varities and choices.  they were a gift for my mother and she was absolutly thrilled.
B0037YTGNS|5|This product is fairly well built, but it is for skinnier women, with small breasts. But still nice to see.
B000HTJ92Y|1|This product is very thin. When I first open it, it looks old. Some parts are more loose than other parts. It feels like it is already been worn by others. I know it is new. It just feels it is out of shape and very thin.
B00EU7AQIU|4|Wish the straps were slightly wider but otherwise a perfect fit.
B006MRNKFW|3|I bought this for my husband to wear.  He's a size medium top about 5'9 and wears a 34 waist.  The chest of the costume was too broad (it stuck out past his chest and sort of bended because it was too big.  He didn't like the foot covers as they kind of were awkward (what guy doesn't have black shoes anyway).  He wore tight underwear (the kind athletes wear so their \\"junk\\" doesn't move around\\" and I have to say, the junk was still visible.  The material is very thin, although he said it kept him warm (we were at an outside party).  Had we gone to an inside party, I'm sure he would've been complaining about the costume being hot.
B00N9SQSR4|4|I like the graphics on the shirt, the material is good quality, the only thing is that it is a little large for a 4 T boy. I am hoping that it will shrink a bit in the wash. Shirt arrived on time, my son is happy, he doesn't mind that it was a little big for him.
B00R5B0VHY|1|The fit was a bit small even though I ordered a size larger than I normally would. They are also see-through so, don't plan on wearing colored underwear....
B00Q45F0M8|5|Perfect pair of shorts, now too long and not too short and the fit is perfect. I am 5'8&#34; and weight fluctuate between 145-150lbs and wear a 6-8 depending on those five pounds. I have bought every color I could find in a size 8 and a couple of size 6. They fit as expected. I have found with an 8 I can wash and dry them and they fit, with my 6's I don't put them in the dryer. The eight tend to stretch a little be use I should be wearing a 6 all the time but have a implant in my stomach and need the little extra give the 8 gives in the waists. I am a difficult body shape and tend to be small waisted but have been blessed with hips no matter what my weight. I his is the perfect pair of shorts and I have even bough a coulple of the denim ones just because when you find one you love, snatch them up. They hit me about mid thigh and I am 47 which is too old for shorter and too young for the longer ones. It is a rare thing for me to find a pair that fit so well on me. You won't be disappointed.
B002ESD4OU|2|I really wanted this to work. First it doesn't hold long enough. Second, it's too small to fit anything in it. Great idea but poorly executed.
B0097LQI9A|4|If they would have added one more row of ruffles it would have been perfect. Delicate and classy.
