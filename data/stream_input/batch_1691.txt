B0054JZC6E|5.0|enjoyed having multiple games in one app some are kinda tricky still I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good game
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's a fun game and very challenging and of course the price was right. I'd buy another product of this quality in a moment.
0316228532|3.0|Having never read a Harry Potter book, I read THE CASUAL VACANCY without preconceived notions. The book is advertised as being full of \\"black humor,\\" but I didn't find anything the least funny in this tale of damaged and poisonous people, all trying to even some score against their neighbors. Rowling apparently took care to make all her characters (including a tragic three-year-old boy and a number of unhappy teenagers) unsympathetic and obnoxious, and in this, she succeeded. Her writing is crisp and realistic, and it's impressive that she had the professional courage to turn from enormously popular fantasy to such a grubby story. Altogether, the book is a bit of a potboiler, but Rowling wraps it up successfully, concluding with few happy endings but some sense of faint justice.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun, challenging, and familiar while offering new themes. It's like most other gem games. The tracing thing is weird and juvenile, but other than that it's pretty great.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|there's this old movie where you never see the killer and you just follow the story by what the camera sees, a great old black and white  story. this whole story takes place pretty much in a car ride. who would think it could be that exciting. it was great, tension and supense. i keep thinking, wow, he is still in the car and the story is still building. don't want to say any more and ruin the book but a great read. Jack Reacher, rocks.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|This is one of the most iconic albums of a generation...that was never heard, let alone appreciated.  It is simply amazing.
B009GLHF5C|5.0|I just wanted to get a vote in on this album.  I have not reviewed in over a year, but this album made me get off my behind and give my two cents.  I saw Muse a couple years ago at Outside Lands and I can't put up a reasonable argument against the \\"Greatest Live Band\\" label.  I am really enjoying this album as a whole and have not focused on individual songs, other than Madness, which seems to have gotten more radio play.  I guess the first single also?<br /><br />I think it still sounds like Muse, but I expect a big range from Muse.  I really don't think you'll (whoever you is) will be disappointed.<br /><br />p.s.  Just heard \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\" and I'd have to say a bit of Skrillex on that one.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Forget all the kinky stuff (which was entertaining). It is still a love story and I fell in love with them both.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is very interesting and the author knows how to channel the emotions of each individual character.<br />BUT...<br />If you are not a fan of books that something depressing happens in, i do not recommend reading this.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I'll keep this brief...  Watched the movie last night and chuckled the entire way through it, with the exceptions of the times that I gave a full laugh.  Wes Anderson's movies have simply gotten better over time.  I feel I enjoy each more than its predecessor.  He straddles that line between genius and insanity (and films it right between the swim fins I'm sure he wears daily).  While I look forward to his next endeavor, I'm also fairly sure he should be locked up because his brand of crazy is probably communicable.  The cast was fantastic and I highly recommend to people that understand this kind of storytelling.  The story is simple.  Two pre-teens fall in love and run away together... on an island that's about the size of your local mall.  Everyone (seriously, everyone) takes scouting very seriously in this movie.  I also think it's possible that if you put Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, and Jason Schwartzman together on an island for 6 weeks, this movie would have been the likely result even without scripts or planning.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this app no longer works on Kindle Fire.  Loads about 10 statuses correctly then a few more in text only with blue background and locked.  Needs a serious fix
074322454X|4.0|This is fine work about the 506TH(PIR) and the 101st Airborne Division. In most accounts I always favor the book and this is no exception. Good details about the training in Camp Toccoa and trng in England in prep for Operation Overlord very detailed in the fights of Easy company the changes of leadership throughout there campaign's Kudous to the authour.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Just finished reading Defending Jacob and it had me from the first page.  I couldn't wait to get back to reading it every time I put it down.  I thought it was a very believable book.  At times, I felt it was predictable but then there would be a twist that totally surprised me.  I loved it!
080214473X|5.0|This is great piece of work not only describes OP Gothic Serpent and Restore hope; but the history of the country and background as well as the events leading up to. I found this hard to put down good reading.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site so much. it has a lot of great ideas.. but it is so addicting!!!! you will see things you never thought of before!!
0440236304|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read about War World II combat. The details are chillings it is honest and direct it pull's no punches; it is written from the Grunt's perspective because he has lived it and survived it Awesome work Awesome.
B009KHBDUU|5.0|I think this remake of the series was very good. My family enjoyed the movie and Johnny Depp did a fine job.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I LOVE this app !!!!! Its so electronic. The display is similar to a spectrum analyzer's oscilloscope display screen.  I just wish it could sample the airwaves quicker.  I look so techie with this on my kindle's screen at the burger joint.
B00540G3G6|5.0|This is a really great product, and I am glad that I purchased it. The best part is that it comes with so many different copies, it is nice to get all of them at once (even though I don't have a 3D tv) so I don't have to keep purchasing the movie over and over again. Same great film and excellent quality!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|this game has been my joy game for many years it's awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I Luv it and I bet you will to!
B00933ZIF2|5.0|one of the best series on television that has been so riveting always makes you want to watch more<br />really keeps you wondering<br />can't wait until season 2 episodes are available
B00723NWJE|3.0|I like Norah Jones a lot, and I appreciate her willingness to try new things. This particular CD, though, is kind of depressing to listen to. She says it's not (completely) autobiographical, but it sounds and feels like a \\"breakup CD\\" that was recorded to get back at someone.<br /><br />The musicianship and vocals are as good as ever, but the CD needed a couple of songs to provide some relief from the bitterness. It's not something I'd want to listen to over and over.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the graphics very much. Don't like having to buy energy to keep playing - it seems to move slowly because of the need to stop and buy something.  I thought it was more than hidden items but it seems that it is mostly that.  Not really impressed but not giving up yet.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This is a fun game if you like hidden object with a few mini games between the chapters.<br />It's. much the same as most other games by this publisher. I wish they would not have the same repeating items to find in most of their games but I still find them the best of the bunch!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Love this app.  Thinking about buying a Kindle just haven't decided on the right one for me yet.  However, I'm enjoying buying books from amazon and reading on my android phone and my thrive tablet.  The best thing is when I get my Kindle all the books I've purchased will be avialable on it.  that's awesome!!!
B005IUP624|5.0|Portia de Rossi's book is a must read for those suffering from eating disorders.  It does not promote itself as a \\"self-help\\" book but as a brutally honest narrative of her journey to hell and back.  She does not hold anything back and her open revelation on starving herself to meet society's ideals, the entertainment industry's expectations of the ideal female form, combined with her misguided view of what it means to be a professional is sure to resonate among those with similar experiences.  It is rare to find a Hollywood celebrity writing about their fears and feelings of low self-esteem in a very naked way.  De Rossi should be commended for that.  Yes, there are celebrities who write \\"tell all\\" books, but de Rossi writes from the heart, digging even deeper into her soul.<br /><br />There are parts of the book that are repetitive - descriptions of her eating habits, the constant struggle over her sexuality and others.  But they serve to reinforce the constant presence of the demons that were part of her since her early modeling days.<br /><br />She brings to the front that Hollywood celebrities do not \\"have it all.\\"  They are human beings, just like the rest of us.  And beyond the eating disorders, the most important message of her book is acceptance of one's self.  She does not offer tricks and techniques of achieving this.  But put simply, it is the starting point and each individual must find their own way.<br /><br />If you are expecting to be voyeuristic, this book is not for you.  The poor ratings written by some amazon.com readers draw from their disappointment that De Rossi did not delve into her sexual relationships.  But that is not why she wrote the book.  And she is far too classy to even dwell upon the subject.<br /><br />It is my understanding that she penned this book herself, not relying on ghost writers.  De Rossi's book is an easy read, her imagery is vivid and disturbing at times, and her literary style makes the reader feel he or she is standing close by, watching as her life unraveled.  One almost wants to reach out to save her from herself.  You can feel yourself drowning with her.<br /><br />This book will help so many who struggle with issues of self-esteem and sexuality.  She is among the fortunate few to return to health and to have found acceptance and love.  It is likely to come as a shock to homophobes that gay people can love as deeply as the \\"rest of us.\\"ing close by, watching as her life unraveled.

B0079J28NW|4.0|The Beatles, having just completed their monumental recording of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" in early April and started recording for the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" film project in late April of 1967, signed contracts in early May for the making of a full-length animated film based around their 1966 song \\"Yellow Submarine\\". They were to provide at least three new songs and allow use of others previously released for the soundtrack. The Yellow Submarine film was theatrically released by United Artists (in mono) in UK theaters premiering on 7/17/68 (the following day they worked on recording \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\") and in the US on 11/13/68. The album of the same name however, wasn't released until UK 1/17/69 and US 1/13/69. There were two reasons for the delay. One was that the band felt the November 1968 release of \\"The Beatles\\" should take precedence, the other was that George Martin wanted to re-record his orchestral score for side two of the LP, which he did in two three hour sessions on Oct. 22 and 23. The first \\"new\\" song for the film was \\"Only A Northern Song\\", which was originally George Harrison's first offering for the Sgt. Pepper album, and began life in the studio on 2/13/67. This track was mixed mono for the film, mock stereo for LP, and never mixed stereo or 5.1 until 1999. The second contribution was Lennon/McCartney's \\"Baby You're A Rich Man\\", the first song recorded especially for the film. It was recorded and mixed mono on 5/11/67 in less than six hours. Though it was used in the film, it was released as the B-side of \\"All You Need Is Love\\" on 7/7/67, just prior to the film's release. It too was mono on film, and mock stereo until 1999 (except for The Beatles Box, Parlophone 1971). The next evening brought McCartney's \\"All Together Now\\". It also was recorded and mixed mono in less than six hours. May 25 began another Harrison number, \\"It's All Too Much\\". Finally,  Lennon's \\"Hey Bulldog\\", making it four new songs, was recorded. The song's lyrics were completed, music composed, recorded and mixed in a single ten hour session on 2/11/68.  According to engineer Geoff Emerick, everyone was especially pleased with that tune. They were filmed recording it, but the footage was actually used to promote \\"Lady Madonna\\". The happy mood seen on that footage might be because they knew it was their last recording session before leaving for their long holiday in India. The \\"Hey Bulldog\\" animated film segment was only seen theatrically in Europe and not available in the US until the 1999 DVD.<br /><br />Video tape and LaserDisc was released for home use in 1987 by MGM/UA in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio and simulated stereo. After a couple of years, it went out of print.<br /><br />Then, after cleaning the original film negative and rejuvenating the color in 1999, MGM/Apple released the widescreen DVD, 5.1 Dolby Digital, restoring the \\"Hey Bulldog\\" sequence and adding several special features.This version also went out of print.<br /><br />Finally, we have the the 2012 Apple Blu-ray and DVD released in June, after the May theatrical release. Compared to the MGM 1999 DVD, the Apple 2012 reissue is a welcomed improvement. Both the audio and video are better.<br /><br />Video: This is the major improvement of this new release. The film has been restored in 4K digital resolution for the first time by Paul Rutan Jr. and his team at Triage Motion Picture Services and Eque Inc. Because of the delicacy of the hand-drawn original artwork, no automated software was employed in the digital clean-up, it was all done by hand, frame by frame, over a four month period. I can't imagine the man hours involved, but the results are spectacular, clean and vivid! Though the 1999 DVD  release says \\"widescreen\\" and the new blu-ray says 1.66:1, there is more picture information visible on the blu-ray. I have not yet verified their true aspect ratios.<br /><br />Audio: I am happy to say that the same 1999 5.1 remix by Pete Cobbin is incorporated here. He did an exceptional job! Messing with the Beatle's soundtracks is a delicate task, especially when \\"enhancing\\". Keep in mind that these new mixes originated from 4 track analog tapes, often having several separately recorded instruments overlaid on the same track and running though boards all intended for mono. The sound here is as if the master tape is being played back.  These recordings were made by Norman Smith and Geoff Emerick back in 1965-68, yet they sound better than most recordings made today. Listen for example to the vocals and the strings in \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" or the clarinets and tubular bells in \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\".  The surround enhancement is done very tastefully, especially during the songs. The songs don't sound pulled apart as some engineers would do. I especially like the surround effects done for \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\". Throughout the well known songs you hear more distinction between instruments and harmonies.<br /><br />For the first time, we have it in DTS at home. The theatrical re-release of the film in 1999 included a new 5.1 remix in the DTS audio format, however, the subsequent 1999 DVD was released only in 5.1  Dolby Digital. We now have it in DTS-HD Master Audio (English only), which sounds better than in Dolby Digital.<br /><br />There are however, two audio caveats. The first being that the output level is about 11.5 dB too loud. Though the dynamic range is actually improved by 2.0 dB over the Dolby Digital DVD, the over-all level is set way above reference level, so be cautious.<br /><br />The second caveat is the omission of the music-only option, which allowed you to listen to the film's score only (no dialog or sound effects) on the 1999 DVD. I found it interesting, but I suppose most didn't.<br /><br />Bonus features: Both the Yellow Submarine DVD and Blu-ray include a short making-of documentary titled Mod Odyssey\\" (TRT: 7:30), the film's original theatrical trailer, audio commentary by producer John Coates and art director Heinz Edelmann, several brief interview clips with others involved with the film, storyboard sequences, 29 original pencil drawings and 30 behind-the-scenes photos. Both Digipaks include reproductions of 4 animation film cells, 10 collectible stickers, and a 16-page booklet (same text as 1999 insert) with a new essay by Yellow Submarine aficionado John Lasseter (Chief Creative Officer, Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios). Note that there is no new A/V material over the 1999 DVD.orporated here. He did an exceptional job! Messing with the Beatle's soundtracks is a delicate task, especially when \\"enhancing\\".

B008ALA6DW|4.0|I bought the Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter for my MacBook Air (Mid 2012), primarily for times when the Wi-Fi connection is spotty or when a wired connection is my only option.<br /><br />The build quality is excellent and it pretty much works right out of the box.  Mac OS X 10.8.2 recognized the adapter immediately and grabbed an IP address from the DHCP server.  The Thunderbolt connector does get warm, but that's normal because it's an active cable; there's an integrated chip in the connector that produces heat.  I would've really liked a small link light, but I can monitor the connection with software if I really need to.<br /><br />I could've bought a cheaper 3rd party Fast Ethernet USB adapter for about $7, but I really wanted the Gigabit speeds.  Time Machine backups to my NAS are much faster using the Gigabit Ethernet adapter than over Wi-Fi and I can easily carry it around with me, just in case.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game to play. I enjoy playing this game. The game has great color and great puzzle.
0307951529|5.0|I purchased this book based upon several references from mutual friends. An excellent and quick read and worth the price plus more.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Many of the points the Dr makes were theories that I have personally had for years but couldn't put words to...he puts another's voice to it that is far more technically knowledgeable about the brains function than I.<br /><br />How time differs from what we understand, how we aren't separate from God or heaven but in our human \\"suit\\"(my words not his) we have filters in place which don't allow us to see the glory and miracle all around us...not immediately visible until you understand them for what they are.<br /><br />It helps explain on a deeper level why it was so painful for Jesus to be separated from God even if only for a short while.  That once you have been there you realize that while life in this realm(earthly)is precious, what is ahead is so much better.  That we realize the fear of this new place or what happens next is completely unfounded.  Sort of like a childs first day of school....by the afternoon most love what they initially feared and never look back to the time before as \\"better\\".<br /><br />I am not sure why but I am certain there is a deep truth to what this Dr experienced. Once I got started I literally stayed up all night reading it.<br /><br />I come from 25yrs of a very technical background myself where everything has to have an answer, a reason why it works or fails...we don't allow shades of gray or the unexplained in my work.  I am the ultimate doubting Thomas and need proof and then documented observational testing/PROOF of it working before I am sold on it and put it into production. Perhaps that is why this Dr's approach...the measuring, going analytical AGAINST what your natural thoughts tell you, making certain to measure in great deal the opposing hypothesis to your thoughts/beliefs ....really works for me. The world is full of crackpots and those easily fooled with emotional tales....but this guy isn't a crackpot and I am no emotional fool.  While I don't know him personally I know plenty like him.<br /><br />Doc if you read these reviews, don't be concerned if you find some haters/doubters/non-believers...in the end it won't matter as we all will experience it and KNOW for certain. I commend you talking about your experience and wish you all the best.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is an intense, current, sexy, political psycho thriller!  Inspired by The Manchurian Candidate, and set in our present time, it spans from the geopolitical to the intensely personal.  Great series!  Can't wait for Season 2.
0375851569|5.0|I used these books to raise the parent of the triplets, now she is using the same ones for the same reason!  The books are forever young, rhythmic, and exciting!
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Great action film tying in many of the recent action heros!  It would have been helpful to have seen Thor more recently however since much of the Thor plot line is used in Avengers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I literally loved every word of these books. They are smart, clever and very well written (and not one typo - bonus!). You will be cheering for the good guys and booing the bad guys all while enjoying a true scifi gem.<br />And... I didn't skim through a single paragraph. (You all know you do it when a discription gets too long or something turns a little boring.)<br />Post apocalyptic scifi at it's best
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the second book, it was much better than the first,and this was already great!! It's not like 50Shades, but it's also very interesting n 'entertaining' to read :) I hope the 3rd follows soon and doesn't come out in May 2013 like it says on Amazon.<br />Looking forward to find out more about Gideons past in the final book :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app that has been a great stress reliever in those few minutes with nothing going on. highly recommended with the caveat that when you have your phone muted this should not make any sounds but does
B009GEEMLY|4.0|It's nice to have fun characters with a good storyline and a real movie. There is the Michael Bay approach with Transformers<br />etc which for me is a snore. With the Avengers and the character series of Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America I've enjoyed pretty much the whole series and Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is terrific.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy is the best I've read. I hope the author writes a 4th! A MUST READ for every woman and man for that matter!
1451608659|3.0|It's amazing the Dominique grew up to enjoy a \\"normal\\" life despite all the things that were done to her as a child.  Her father was tyrannical and ruled with an iron fist.  Her mother couldn't be a shelter in the storm for Dominique because of her husband's tyrannical ways.  Bela Karoyle uderstood the dynamic and used it to keep Dominique in hell.  And to learn at 20-something that you have a sister born with no legs that you've never heard of before, must have been totally devastating.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Pros:<br />I'm very satisfied with the quality of the workouts Jillian demonstrates - this is very efficient if you only have time for a 30 minutes workout.  I like the 3-2-1 system (3 minutes strength, 3 minutes cardio, 1 minute abs).  And the 3 levels offer plenty of variety.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Jillian is very annoying.  You can turn her off (music only) - but then you have to keep watching to know when to switch to the next move.  When I'm focusing on working out and getting my form right, I don't want to have to watch the tv to see when to switch (the music option should notify when to change moves).  So I've been keeping Jillian turned on.  I find her instructions ok - but I could really do without the \\"if you only want to work out 20 minutes a day\\", \\"chop chop ladies\\", etc.  If you need constant \\"motivation\\" - then you will probably enjoy her instruction.  If you are self-motivated, you find all her extra talk to be annoying.<br /><br />The DVD does not let you forward to the menu.  So I have to watch the intro video every time I want to start a workout.  I could care less about the Biggest Loser and her other videos - I want to work out, not wait several minutes just to get to the work out selection.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is a real page turner. I really enjoyed it. It is a bit dark though. It's not going to leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy.
0525423656|3.0|I felt like everything that happened in this book could have been condensed into a few chapters in a two book series instead of a trilogy. It was nice meeting new characters and learning more about Ky, but I was left a little disappointed. Hopefully the third book will tie up loose ends and not aimlessly wander so much.
B000FC1HBY|1.0|This is a rewrite of the first book.  nothing new here.  The only thing better about the rewrite is that he spends less time talking about what they had for dinner.  Total waste of money.
B007SGM084|5.0|Be prepared for some steamy scenes...<br />I liked the book.  The ending could have been better though.  I don't want to give it away-so I won't say anymore :-)
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|get it!!!!!!!!! you must get this game its the best game ever. you have to get this game for your kindle fire
B001BR3P0S|5.0|This is my all-time favorite 80s cult classic movie.  Believable teenage drama, humor, friendship, acceptance, and the unknown.  My 14 year-old loves this movie as much as I do.  It just goes to show you the story is classic and young adults still relate to it today.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So it;s a love story if you cut thru all the sex stuff.  Even with skipping pages it was a great read!
B000V86OKG|5.0|Everything arrived as expected and in a timely manor. I would recommend this vendor to a friend. Super dee dooper.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|We made a family event of it and loved it. It looked great in 2d and passive 3d. My whole family wants to buy the hard copy in 3d. Can't wait for Amazon to come out with all the 3d movies that are out now so we can digitally stream them and buy. The movie was full of action sequences, hot guys, pretty women, and humor. Loved the humor.
B0099G3I96|4.0|The album is fun and enjoyable for any true No Doubt fan. It's not the pinnacle of their career but its still very good and has their signature sound. The front of half of the album hits hard and then the second half dwindles away.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is awesome. since I first read the first one I was hooked on this book. Once we get to know ana n christian we want to know how their relationship will progress. its just an intriuging book that i keep wanting more and more.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|but I have no idea how anyone plays these without the help of a walk through? Well worth the $!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Extremely entertaining original sci fi   series. tho dark in theme, the series was always hopeful  for a “happy“ ending. Jules was   an inspiring hero and captivating to the end. the promise of other books to come is  good or annoying depending on your outlook (think game of thrones if you read it expecting an end).
B008NABUU8|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day today.  The only real problem I have had with  it is that it kept drawing me back to it at work and I ran my battery down pretty quickly today.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2VHVNX8TYOIJG]]District 9 is one of the century's greatest science fiction films.<br /><br />Director Neill Blomkamp, producer Peter Jackson, and the unknown but extremely talented cast (including Sharlto Copley, who will be starring in Blomkamp's upcoming sci-fi Elysium and Spike Lee's Oldboy remake) crafted a film that is totally original, absolutely ingenious, heartfelt, and action packed.<br /><br />This entertaining short film was directed by Neill Blomkamp, and was the inspiration to direct District 9. One can indeed see the similarities between the two films.<br /><br />Interesting fact: The dialogue spoken by most of the \\"interviewees\\" was unscripted. The filmmakers asked ordinary people what they thought about the refugees living there, and what they said replied was directed at them.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Reflected in You, the second book in Sylvia Day's Crossfire series starring Eva Tramell and Gideon Cross opens right where Bared to You leaves off. Eva and Gideon are still the same two emotional messes who confuse love with obsession and use sex to avoid working out their problems. But, thankfully, the more I read, I finally began to see some positive changes in Eva's behavior that left me hopeful that their relationship could be salvaged from the codependent disaster that began in book one.<br /><br />Both Eva and Gideon are still dealing with their individual insecurities and self-esteem issues. Do either of them need to be in a relationship? No way and especially not with each other. But their explosive passion and need for one another are too powerful to ignore and they heedlessly push on despite their numerous problems.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon's relationship is an unhealthy combination of jealousy, anger, control and obsession. There are serious trust issues on both sides. Gideon's need to know Eva's every move continues and it is still eerily stalkerish. The jealousy they both experience is compounded by a severe lack of communication. The head games continue on both sides and the angst reaches an all time high.<br /><br />Sex between Eva and Gideon is still intense and incredibly hot. But Eva and Gideon are equally guilty of using sex to evade probing questions. They also use sex as a weapon and a punishment and as a means to get their own way.<br /><br />In Reflected in You, we finally see more of the self-assured and self-aware Eva that we were originally introduced to in Bared to You. She recognizes their relationship is unhealthy and she finally begins to stand up to Gideon's unreasonable demands. She still gives in way more than she should, but at least she acknowledges that Gideon's behavior is NOT normal or healthy. Eva is no longer content with the bits and pieces that Gideon is willing to share and she finally becomes more insistent that he reveal his secrets to her. And when he won't? Eva gets up the nerve to take back the control she so willingly relinquished and finds her self-respect.<br /><br />Gideon continues to frustrate me on so many levels. He is convinced he has all the answers and compromise is not part of his vocabulary. Gideon confuses protection with control and it is just creepy how he continues to keep such close tabs on Eva. So much of his and Eva's anguish could be avoided if he would just TALK to her. Unfortunately, Gideon is a bit slow on this point, and it takes him FOREVER to finally spill his secrets.<br /><br />Overall, I liked Reflected in You a whole lot more than I did Bared to You. I am still not sold on the idea that either Eva and Gideon are truly in love and I also have my doubts they are ready for a relationship. But I am happy that they are finally making some kind of progress. Their journey is an exhausting rollercoaster ride that is full of extreme highs and lows and I am hopeful they are working their way to finding some middle ground. Maybe once they achieve that, they really will find the love they are so desperately seeking.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy for review.his secrets to her. And when he won't?

B000I8G5GW|5.0|David Lean, (perhaps the greatest ever British director after Hitchcock), directed this powerful, well-acted, darkly comic, and always entertaining war film starring Alec Guinness and William Holden.<br /><br />The famous score is wonderful, the scenes set in Vietnam are hot and humid, the story is entertaining and brilliant, and the acting is stellar.<br /><br />Alec Guinness won a much deserved Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of the stiff-upper-lipped Colonel Nicholson, who goes head to head in a battle of authority with Sessue Hayakwaw's Colonel Saito.<br /><br />Kwai is a true classic, that will live on forever as one of cinema's greatest films.

1423140605|3.0|It has finally happened - demigods from the Greek Camp Half-Blood have arrived at the Roman demigod camp in San Francisco.  They are there to reunite Percy with Annabeth and pick up Hazel and Frank so they can begin the quest of the seven to the ancient lands.  The peace between the two camps is fragile at best, but that's better than it's been in all of history.<br /><br />But that peace is shattered when Leo fires on the camp from the ship he's built - an action he can not explain.  The seven hastily set off, but as always gods and monsters are waiting to block their path.  And all the time Nico is trapped in Rome dying.  Will they reach him in time?  Will they rescue him without falling into a trap themselves?  And will Annabeth succeed in a solo quest where so many of her siblings have failed?<br /><br />If those names mean nothing to you, this is definitely not the book for you.  Considering this is the eighth book set in this universe, that's hardly surprising.  Start with the first book about Percy Jackson, and you'll be here before you know it.<br /><br />Having said that, I think long time fans will be a bit disappointed with this one.  While the formula for the stories has always been obvious, here it's a bit more so.  That really causes things to drag in the middle where at least 100 pages could be cut.  Yes, they provide a bit of information about the characters, but they are just too slow.<br /><br />Once the characters reach their final destination for this book, this certainly pick up, and I had a hard time setting the book down.  Characters get further developed, and I like where he is heading with all of them.  And the cliffhanger will have you counting down the days until the next installment.<br /><br />While not the best book with these characters, it is a trip fans will want to take.

B00138KEH2|5.0|To me, Audioslave is one of those bands whose songs I used to listen to, but never really knew which band it was.  I really liked their songs, but to me, I never paid enough attention.  When I saw this album available for 5.00, and all the positive reviews, I went ahead and listened and was really impressed with all the songs I remembered...and how good they all were!  So, for 5.00, it was a no brainer.  This is a great album!
B0072KZ0Z6|4.0|After a slow and not funny start, the series gains momentum and becomes one of the best curreNt comedies. Indeed, after changing a roommate after the initial episode, the series had an uneasy start with its humor feeling forced. What was obvious is that they were not able to capitalize frm the start on what would become the strength of the series: the irritating cute charm of the star theyy had in deschanel. Indeed the first episodes ( and I mean all of the first DVD) are unfunny and forced and make you want to cringe. However on the second DVD suddenly everything changes, basically the writing is much improved and this becomes one of the best series around overall.

B0081SRJSY|4.0|Very happy this game finally came to Android.<br />I used to play the PC version a lot. Unfortunately Microsoft bought it and made in an Xbox live exclusive :(<br /><br />So this game plays very nice on my fire HD and the basic version is a lot of fun.<br /><br />Things I don't like:<br />No extensions (I need my builder and my pig!)<br />Scoring bugs<br />No online multiplayer (cutthroat online play was so much fun)<br />I find the characters weird (and they don't fit with the original design of the game)<br />Some kind of Campaign would be nice, too
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I'm writing this bc I haven't bought a Grisham book that wasn't deeply discounted or free in YEARS.<br />I bought this book after the NYT review-- I think it's the first decent review of a Grisham book in a long time (last I remember).  I have been on and off again about Grisham's books, (mostly off for a long time)  honestly nothing for me will be as good as A Time To Kill, or The Chamber, or as fun as The Firm-- but I have read most of what he's written-- and mostly been \\"eh\\" about Grisham for several years.<br /><br />Ok having said that-- as the title of my review states, this is a book you absolutely have to suspend disbelief-- especially if you are even remotely associated with the legal profession and if you're a lawyer - (actually even if you aren't)  you will roll your eyes at some points-- but you WILL CONTINUE reading, because, as preposterous as some of the plot turns are, you will want to see where he goes with this. The main character stays in kind of a 'foreshadowing\\" mode throughout the story- you kind of think and sometimes know where this is going but because the main character is  also 'unreliable' - you are left unsure-- so as a reader you wonder if the narrator/main character plots against his 'foes'  while simultaneously doing the same to the you (the reader) --- I did think that was pretty interesting on Grisham's part. I can't explain this anymore without spoilers.<br /><br />FYI-- The NYT review was bizarre-- some parts of the review made no sense after i finished the book--and i re-read the review--  this line in particular referring to the main character--  \\"And Mal happens to be black. That fact seems to have nothing to do with the book until Mr. Grisham makes shrewd use of race later on. \\" --- what?  i don't know what they meant by \\"shrewd\\" or \\"shrewd use\\" -- and after reading the book, it seems as though the NYT just read a synopsis and Grisham's afterword.<br /><br />This is not a book that will stay with you long after you've read it,but you know what?  Sometimes that's just fine.  This is NOT a 'legal thriller' in the sense that we are used to. (Grisham admits as much in his afterword). It's not one of his great books,  but it IS PRETTY GOOD-- that's why I gave it 3 stars.<br /><br />IF this sounds like I didn't like the book please just take it as a disclaimer because:<br />This is FUN Grisham. It's a commercial break.  It's a page-turning novel/thirller/mystery and it's ENTERTAINING- much like I'm sure the invevitable movie will be.  I did enjoy this, I couldn't put it down. I do recommend the book with the following caveat: - wait for a lower price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|many times my kindle powered out also from battery and then all the same worlds but no data and its an easy fix.<br />.always exit your world to minevraft main menue before exiting app if not then when the kind powers off<br />.do not power off wile app is running and to fix it :<br />.to fix simply follow intsructions ^then once at kindle home menu and power off by holding down spleepmode button at bottum untill it says power off or shut down FYI this will usaly solve anny lag problems related a lagging device

B00008GKEG|5.0|Excellent. What else can you ask for. This is a great production and in their own words. Also takes up less space than the VHS.

0316044695|1.0|I'm amazed at what a loud mouth chest beater this guy is. Back in the day, read 1990's the 19 year old rangers were the loud mouth punks of the special ops community. This guy comes off like a loud mouth Marine more than a SEAL. He complained about the rules of engagement, but tell you what man, if we didn't care about civilian deaths the Air Force and Navy could just flatten everything in a few days. He should just join Blackwater or whatever they call themselves now so he can hose down everything moving with brown skin and get away with it if that's what he wants.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is the second book of The Hunger Games trilogy. I believe that it is a very good second book which continues to set a new level of originality, just like we saw in the first book. I believe that today creativity is being wasted, but in this case, I believe that it continues to flourish. It is an unexpected and adventurous book which I read quite fast as it's one of those books which you can't stop reading once you start it! Brilliant story!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Who said you need graphics??? Couldn't stop reading, had to purchase the other 2 books in this series immediately. All 3 books read in a couple of weeks.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Good book but very bad translation. It is basically a history book that I would recommend for anyone studying 20th century events.
B008NABUU8|4.0|This game is incredibly fun and challenging and I'll definitely keep it, but like the description says it's unoptimized for Kindle. Most notably, this means it freezes whenever you turn off the display, the loading times can be worryingly slow, and at its worst when I tried to open an in-game link to leave a review, my entire Kindle crashed. The bugginess isn't so bad that it's game-breaking, but it really detracts from the experience.  It's definitely a fun, challenging and gorgeous game, but buy it for the device it was made for.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! I use it all the time for ideas and inspiration for my home and kids.<br />Works great on my tablet too.
B007TK77QE|1.0|So disappointed.  What led JK Rowling to think we all needed another Joanna Trollop.  Sadly the last two Harry Potter books became very rambling with long dialogue and little plot.  This follows in that vein.  I couldn't be bothered to wade through the stuff to actually wait for the plot to develop so I've given up reading when less than half way through.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game was a great game except for the fact that on my kindle fire it glitches almost every time I play it. this game is a lot of fun if you like racing games and other games where you have to jump slide and turn as pretty much the only actions in the game.
B002T9H2LK|4.0|Tarantino abandons traditional Three Act structure, pays homage to 40's film noir, and paints violence with a feathered brush. It leaves you questioning the tender moments because you never fully understand the intentions of the characters involved and the long-winded, dialogue-driven scenes can erupt into room-clearing violence at any moment. His movies have gotten to the point where he's trading splinters for paper cuts, but he does it so damn well that it's impossible to not sit back and enjoy.

B009VB7OV2|1.0|Gossip Girl has grown up and with those crucial scandalous high school years behind her, cannot make the translation into adulthood (or what approximates it on this show.)  Salacious has turned to sleaze and the bad girls aren't really clever, just mean.  All of the conniving has worn thin and while earlier seasons seemed like underhanded moral plays in pretty cloths, this episode reeks of ugly.

B008Y7Y0AM|5.0|There isn't that much that this band hasn't done. They deliver an emotional and dark style of music everyone else tries to imitate. That being said, it leaves them in a bit of a bind on what to do next. Some might have found \\"For Lies I Sire\\" a little short on potential(but it is still a great album) so I think the band felt a little heat for making this album to be a step above. And that is exactly what they did and they delivered in grand style. It only takes the first song to know you have a true killer My Dying Bride album. It truly stands with \\"Songs of Darkness, Words of Light\\" and \\"The Dreadful Ones\\", just to name some of their best works. All aspects of My Dying Brides work is covered in \\"Map of All Our Failures\\": the complete vocal styles and ranges of Aaron, the haunting guitar harmonies, the keyboards and violin and epic songwriting that is theirs and theirs alone. My Dying Bride have so many great albums, it is almost impossibly to have a favorite since they manage to do what they do so well and so uniquely with every album. \\"Map of All Our Failures\\" continues a body of work unmatched by anyone else in metal. Album of the Year and then some!

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft-Pocket Edition is a fabulous game! Many people had complained that it lacks features that PC Minecraft has. However, since the 0.7.0 Alpha update, MCPE has been coming closer to Minecraft PC. This update added global multiplayer, new blocks, new game options, creative mode tweaks, and many bug fixes. Now in version 0.7.5, the game has External IP address connection (for servers OTHER than Realms), MORE bug fixes, tweaks to chests, the sun, moon, and stars.<br /><br />Basically, MCPE is no longer a boring lifeless game. Thanks to the awesome team of developers (both new and old), updates are coming out faster than ever! If you are even CONSIDERING on getting MCPE, don't hesitate to buy it. This game is definitely worth the $6.99! The game is pretty bug free as of now, and it has a bunch of awesome features that are sure to keep you entertained.<br /><br />I also make Minecraft- Pocket Edition news videos. These videos show information from the developers of the game, and tell you basically what is going to be in the next update :D My channel is ThunderBow98, so if you want to stay up to date on all of the latest MCPE news, be sure to subscribe!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Terrible writing, terrible plot, terrible everything.  I'm amazed that this is doing so well.  Plenty of erotic fiction out there, why this one is on top is a mystery.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.  Rent a decent adult film
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of my most favorite books ever...just loved it. Beautiful, sensitive. The dog is an amazing story teller. Simply could not put it down...Perfection!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book, it was romantic, descriptive, the characters were well defined.  I had a hard time putting it down to go to work!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great ending to the trilogy.  The twists and turns of the story kept me glued to the book.
B008NABUU8|4.0|One of the more interesting and challenging games out there. Great for teaching physics to younger kids.  So far, so good.
B0099ZM2FI|4.0|I enjoyed the series. The plot twists, character development, and all the other things (blood, violence, and sex) that made you like the first season and the prequel series are back. It is essentially more of the same, but still entertaining and held my interest throughout the series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thought this was a well written and suspensful dystopian novel.  It had a number of interesting plot points, that were quite different ideas than the normal sci-fi.  Worth checking out.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|The first 4 songs on this album are awesome.  the rest are good too, but the first 4, are unbelievably catchy and funky and just great.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Its been quite awhile since I've gotten into the Marvel series movies, but The Avengers was amazing!  Can't wait them to continue with the other upcoming releases.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I like games like minecraft or block story as much as the rest of you but paying 7 USD for a single building app when you could use that money to buy Block Story and like 3 other $1 apps with it. I'm sure that minecraft is a good game but am I about to spend $20 for PC version or $7 for pocket edition? Heck no!!!!!! Mabye I am just an insane penny pincher or something but those are extreme prices. If the devolepers were truely proud of what they have made here they would set the price at something more affordable, which would result in more people buying it and sence they don't exactly have to mass produce an app you just download then<br />lower prices= more downloads= more profit= bigger budget for updates= better game = more downloades... starting the cycle over again.
0741470314|1.0|I have just finished reading this book by Dr. Moriarty. It is unfortunate that, though she is very well intentioned, it comes off as yet another misstep by an author trying to sell this bit of goods to the Michael Jackson fan community.<br />As truthfully stated in the above reviews there is no new information in the book. It is primarily her thoughts on what Michael endured throughout his life and a series of references to article written years before. I knew all of what she said previously. It is all available on the internet if the fans want to read the right blogs and forums and they do.<br /> Unfortunately for her I have read them all before, apart from her information from the body guards. I understand from reading the forward of her book that she intended to ghostwrite the book for the bodyguards. Well, perhaps she should have stuck with her original idea. I would have loved to hear more from them and am hoping that someday they will find someone willing to write the book the way they intend it to be written.<br />As a Michael Jackson fan I will not give this book my endorsement.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|A great classic film for my generation. Great quality. Still need to watch all of the extra footage. Since midnight showings have started in my area again, I plan to attend in the near future.
B003VANOFY|5.0|First thing I must say is ignore anything anyone says about the sound cutting off. This is due to a driver problem with the one given with the software on the cd.  1) install software from cd  2) Download the proper drivers from this site -> [...]  As far as the actual headset goes, it is just great.    Pros  -----------  Comfortable  Long lasting battery  Wireless goes upto 40ft (I got about 20-30 in my house but it is known to be terrible with wireless signals)  Loud  Great quality sound.    Cons  ----------  Rather pricey, but you get what you pay for  Programmable buttons are not very useful when it comes to fast paced games (You're better off binding to the keyboard)  If you're picky about these sort of things, the headset can only be worn with the mic and buttons on your left ear    Overall I would recommend this to almost anyone
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|I had to rent this to watch fro a school project. I was expecting just another boring and unentertaining film, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. It is exciting, mysterious, complex and interesting from beginning to end. I definitely recommend this title.
B007THA4FI|2.0|From Harry Potter to everyday life and small town scandal??  I expected more excitement or drama.  This is like watching a reality show that never leaves you hanging at the end of the episode.  Wonderfully written, but the content is not what I'd hoped.  I've found I can barely stick with it at times and when I do get back to it, I hope that it's about to get better...but I'm half-way through and it hasn't.
0345803485|5.0|OMG, OMG, the book is great, i've already started on book number three. Once you start to read it is hard to put down.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|The product I purchased encountered all my expectations. The audio quality is very good. Since I love classical music, I found this item very close to my taste. I advice this item to everyone likes this kind of music.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm in love with pinterest!  I was psyched when they made it an app! you need this app! its my life :)
B008YZXYY2|2.0|I remember when [[ASIN:B00415R59O Audio Secrecy]] came out. I'd just turned 23 and got it for my birthday. I'd held off listening to the album from someone else, streaming it, sampling it -  I wanted to hear it with fresh ears. These days that's more and more rare and has become almost as special as coming home from the record store with a new album in your hands. My brother warned me though: \\"It's not very good, one or two songs on there are nice but the rest is really mellow. It doesn't sound like Stone Sour\\". I listened once. Not too bad, quite a decent album. Twice. Three times. Five times. Ten times. Every single time I listened, the album opened up to me and I could appreciate it more and more - after the gravel hard debut album and the \\"breakthrough / hit album\\" [[ASIN:B000P6R96C Come What(ever) May]], I found Secrecy a nice change of pace. It still rocked, but it was a band not afraid to take it to new places and reach new levels of maturity and sincerety. Great sound, great power, and Corey's voice was phenomenal. Even the bonus tracks were fulfilling - so much that I wondered how they could be left out of any version of the album.<br /><br />Now that House of Gold & Bones - Part One is here (chew on that title for a while), it's with a mixture of anticipation and dread. I feel like the guys could've spent another year or even two if they wanted, and now they're releasing two full length albums just two years after their last one. I sincerely hope that it will grow on me like [[ASIN:B00415R59O Secrecy]] did, or that the better cuts are left for the second half of this duology. We are off to a rocking start with \\"Gone Sovereign\\" and \\"Absolute Zero\\", two energetic rock tracks with both melody and power. They both felt a little so-so on first listen but they've come to really grow on me. The first one is a crusher, the second one has that huge memorable chorus. They're still both a walk in the park for Stone Sour though, almost reverting back to their self-titled sound. Speaking of which, \\"A Rumor of Skin\\" could fit right into the first album as well. A slow grind with an awkward chorus. Things are pointing down now. There is a little bit of promise in \\"The Travelers - Part 1\\", but the song is little more than acoustic wall dressing, neither strong enough as a heartwrenching ballad or long enough to build into some power ballad stuff. All those distorted voices are distracting and hardly original - Corey has used it many, many times with both Slipknot and Stone Sour. \\"Tired\\" is one more song that holds real promise - I'm loving the string arrangement, and it's got a sweeping chorus, but the song never really lifts and grabs your attention. \\"RU486\\" is one of the harder tracks, but again, it sounds like absolute autopilot. There's no character to it other than the title, and it's nowhere near as crushing as say \\"Nylon 6/6\\". \\"My Name Is Allen\\" is one more song that just trudges right along, perfectly mediocre. I hate to say it, but you can press skip without regret or hesitation. We finally get something like an actual song in \\"Taciturn\\", but it starts as one more beautiful little acoustic ditty, and you can almost visualize Corey squeezing that guitar like a wrung out lemon. It picks up a little bit but there's just nothing to gather from the song. The best song on the album follows though. \\"Influence of a Drowsy God\\" is the only song that stands out with some feeling and melody, something to latch onto, finally! It fuses Jim's rocking guitars with Corey's desperate vocals and heartbeat drums to create a soulful track just powerful enough to be taken seriously. \\"The Travelers - Part 2\\" does work as an excellent straight follow-up to \\"Part 1\\", they blend together to form one of the most sonically interesting moments on the album. It's the only tune that feels like it's taking you on a journey, akin to Pink Floyd. Finally a heavy sendout with \\"Last of The Real\\", but it also feels jumbled together like a broken puzzle, like the chorus was almost an afterthought, and the vocals are an odd mixture of wailing and half-paced growls.<br /><br />The saga of \\"House of Gold & Bones\\" supposedly tells us about a young man at a crossroads - he can decide to mature into an adult or remain a kid forever. Hopefully we'll see him blossom in \\"Part 2\\", otherwise I fear there's little hope for him to be remembered at all.he chorus was almost an afterthought, and the vocals are an odd mixture of wailing and half-paced growls.<br /><br />The saga of \\"House of Gold & Bones\\" supposedly tells us about a young man at a crossroads - he can decide to mature into an adult or remain a kid forever.

B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I love Talking Tom. He is so funny! I can't believe this app is free. He repeats what you said back but in a very silly way. I had fun all afternoon. My parents and my brother were very annoyed.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This was a good book but not worth the hype it is receiving. I have read better books. Hopefully the love story gets better in the next two books.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is an active game that continuosly keeps your brain active from start to finish.  Great to help kids develope their brains and for older people to keep their brains young and active.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl provides the reader with a view into one woman's perverse ability to manipulate her dark side so well that she easily deceives those closest to her while, at the same time, rationalizing her behavior to herself to justify getting whatever she wants at any price. This book made me ask myself just how well I really know the people I'm close to....or how well I've allowed them to know me.
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|Other reviews here have so far been on the harsh side, and I can't really disagree.  There are things here I would've loved to have seen included.  Things I would've expected and upon first noticing just the focus on the basic So album itself, had me close to just skipping this wonderful release.  But I did get it and am writing this as Biko from Live In Athens is ringing out on my speakers.  When I started writing I figured it deserved 4 stars... but the sound of Gabriel live, and that band!  That amazing band sounding so good... well, I couldn't not give this 5 stars!<br /><br />Of course, you can get the Live In Athens and the remastered album for less, but when it's all said and done, I can't fault this set.  So is a fantastic album, and one that has aged very well.  The live album and DVD and absolutely fantastic, as is the So DNA disc.  All that and options to download everything in 24 bit digital (and some 720p video as well) make this a snap shot of that moment of Gabriel's career.<br /><br />This set was put together with care and much attention to detail and it shows.  More would've been nice.  But this remains an excellent set as it is.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I spend way too much time on this app!  Got it for my Kindle Fire and it works great!  Actually streamlines Pinterest and makes it easier to use.  I prefer the app over the website.  Only problem is that it crashes once in a while, but I think that is more of a problem with the Kindle than the app.  Kindle can slow things down and other apps crash sometimes too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This whole series of three books is great fun to read. Of course, they are sexy, actually very erotic; but the story is good, too.
B009VW6VA6|4.0|This episode examines the huge differences between each of the characters and, particularly, the BFF's.  Linking them are some significant acts, both good and bad, that have occurred over years of friendship.  They haven't forgotten these things but, it is made clear, have chosen to continue in their relationships because they are kooky, original, compelling and, ultimately, kind.  Genuine and really funny.  Finally an episode I can wrap my head around.  Yay!
B0086700CM|5.0|It is sooo muchh funnn its hard not to spend your money but I did it and saved 10000$ just to be a girl because I didn't want to be a boy.
B004YM6JLO|3.0|Initially I was very pleased with the product. The first four discs were great. Then when I tried to watch the fifth disc there was nothing on it. Disappointed would be the appropriate word.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A very nice, challenging, simple puzzler. Great for train rides to and from work. A good wide range of difficulty.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another great NS novel... I really enjoyed this one because it had a sense of mystery about it.  It wasn't just the average clear cut love story.
1609613937|5.0|This book made practical sense.  It helped me decide to try to become a Vegan.  I have been a Vegan for almost 4weeks and am feeling great!  I am now off my diabetes pills.  My blood pressure is lower and my arthritis seems to be feeling better.  Try it you might like being a Vegan.
0345803485|1.0|I started the book, and could not believe it is a best seller. Most of part of the book is repetitive. The ending is no surprise. The ending is Miss Steele tried herself to find out Mr. Prince is an abuser, so she left him. To save time, you just need to read the 1st 4 chapters and the last chapter.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This is the second book in this series. I have been really enjoying this series. Can't wait for the third. Very steamy! If you liked Fifty Shades of Gray you will enjoy the Crossfire Novels!!! A must read. You'll end up cheering and hoping everything works out for all the characters in this book. Sylvia Day does not disappoint!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Run a little slow at times, but I love having on the go access!! It is just enough to satisfy my Pinterest needs.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Entertaining and addictive :-)<br />Puzzles are just challenging enough to keep you motivated to clear the board. played this for four hours lost track of time.
B009KHCT94|1.0|I rented this movie knowing that what I was about to watch was going to be very low budget and very non-impressive. My immature side talked me into watching this just so I could say to myself that I watched a movie with Nazi's on the moon that invaded Earth. ...And they did. And of course I was dissapointed in myself for spending the money on such a horribly done movie with a pathetic plot as the credits began to show at the end of the movie. When will I learn?
B0090NNQX6|5.0|The great thing with Mika is that his albums aren't boring. This third album particularly contains a myriad of songs all different from one another, so they don't end up blending in the background by the time you're done listening to it, like so many albums these days, where all the tunes and beats are the same, only the lyrics change. You get a surprise with each new track, and you just feel so happy at the end of each song that when you're done listening to the CD, you just have to listen to it over, and over, and over again...<br />I love all three albums, but this one is my favorite so far. The Deluxe edition is a must have.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|Great book about Justin and loved looking at the photos as well. Can't wait for the next book! Read this in two days!
0571238343|5.0|So, I had to get this book for a class, and it's awesome. It's really helpful when it comes to walk cycles, and various kinds of walk cycles. It's just really cool.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this was such a great book! i could NOT put my kindle down, the books were were hot, sexy, intense, and so much more, i looooved the books and have fallen for Mr. Grey :D definitely recommend the books
B008XNZMOU|3.0|It's not as good as Speak Now, but I keep listening to it.  Taylors songs sound very similar, they are all about the same thing, but she keeps delivering. And did she just break 20 years old? That's quite an accomplishment. Aside of what everyone says, I think she's a great songwriter. Good job.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This is my favorite book. I've been with Lauren Oliver for a while now, and going from Before I Fall to this book- I'm astonished.<br />I laughed, I yelled, and I cried- A lot.<br />Great read.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|very good writer, easy reading, easy understanding,<br />good book to understand the paradigms of life!<br />especially liked when the author puts that wealth is:  how much money you saved not how much you spend ......
B004PLWGVG|4.0|I really liked this album and it has good songs,even those I hadn't heard yet. I would definatly purchase it again.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! JK has proven how diversified she is as an author! Would recommend everyone to pick this up an give it a read!
0451232852|3.0|My review is only regarding the kindle edition. I am unable to find the Europe map on the kindle edition. It is present in the inside page of the cover on the hardcopy of the book. For some of us who are geographically challenged with Europe, this is frustrating. I had to hunt on Google to find a political map that presents the accurate situation in early 1900.<br />Amazon, please address this issue, if possible.<br />Apart from this, the story is very good so far. (Page 250 of 850).
0425263908|5.0|I thought 50 Shades of Grey would be my favorite read of the year, but now the Crossfire Series will definitely tie the Grey series at number 1!! Had me wanting to keep reading. I couldn't stop. I can't wait to receive the second one!
B008XG1X18|5.0|the only thing I would change is not having to leave the page to like or repin other than that I absolutely love this app spend hours on this app even on the laptop
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Such a great story. i was worried it was going to be predictable, but i was wrong. I am so glad i was wrong!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I know this is a good book....after all, it's by Ken Follett.  I purchased an ebook...great to have the reading material in minutes!
B004XANKVO|5.0|I have used Amazon for years, and have never bothered to write a review, despite placing much trust in the community to give me accurate reviews. I've been leeching for a long time, and this bag is so good that I just had to review it.<br /><br />Out of the box, this bag brings only one word to mind: Quality.<br /><br />I have had similarly priced North Face packs for years and never realized what I was missing in terms of design. This pack has a pocket for all of my small items that I used to carry all in one big pocket. Not to mention perfectly sized pockets for my laptop and iPad... Thule has done an outstanding job and I am very satisfied.<br /><br />Plus, with Amazon Prime this pack arrived in under 2 days for a price $20 under my local REI store!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books pull you in and won't let go. I'm not typically a person who \\"stalks\\" an author but Mr Howey has made me want to keep tabs on his literary comings and goings. Read it!
630575067X|5.0|this will complete my star wars vhs movie collection so happy perfect condition and it was only a penny and that totally surprise
B009KKLQKO|2.0|The Beach Boys juggernaut 2012 world tour was highlighted with some exceptional performances: Bonnaroo, where the band successfully enthralled an audience three times as young; Hollywood Bowl, a triumphant homecoming of sorts, complete with the introduction of thier children's ensemble California Saga; The Beacon Theater featuring  the band's first truly 'jelled' performance without all the fleshing /feeling out that evolved early in the tour; Red Rocks, probably the most connected performance between band and audience in the US; and finally the epic 55-song London Wembley Arena show featuring an inspired, animated Brian Wilson and a band that rose to the occasion driving the point they are indeed \\"The Great American Rock Band\\".<br />Plenty of moments.  Plenty of memories.  Sadly this current offering attempt appears to only offer snippets, a glimpse of the comeback of the year 2012.  With only 21 songs, the set offers only a fraction of the real concert setlist. Missing are presentations of the show featuring underplayed classics such as \\"Add Some Music To Your Day\\", \\"This Whole World\\", \\"Disney Girls\\" and Pet Sounds material (a great Dave Marks' rendition of the title track and the poignant \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\").<br />Bluntly put, marketing geniuses should have focused on the whole, not the parts. For starters, a complete Wembley Arena  or Red Rocks performance(maybe three DVDs) might have been produced; a fourth DVD included documenting a rigors of touring for aging performers, sound checks, television performance highlights, various interviews, etc.<br /><br />This offering reeks of an opportunistic effort to make a quick buck without thinking through and developing a product that fans would appreciate.  I would spend $60 on a well-packaged DVD boxed set than $15 on this abridged version of the same.  I'd rather see the amatuer videos posted by true fans on YouTube.<br /><br />Columnated Ruins Dominoe....
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book I could not wait for the next! This is one of my favorite books I have read!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I give only two stars because i am so sick of the main characters dying while the \\"bad guys\\" seem to flourish. I made myself get over Ned and Robb and catelyn as well. But just when i have created new heroes to champion they end up dead as well! can the good guys catch a break ever????? my gosh ,not every story has a happy ending but can anything go right for the good people in these books? Just one good thing ? c'mon already! enough is enough for me.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|This is a beautiful movie. Rachel McAdams brings to life a character who is sweet and vulnerable. Her portrayal exudes extraordinary depth and empathy. Equally matched is Ryan Gosling, who is a subtle leading man, and vulnerable in his own right. James Garner and Gena Rowlands are pros and round this movie out to allow us to follow their lifetime of love and to shed many tears in the process. A must see!
B0078XFYDA|4.0|This book is for those of any age who are still undersided as to what to believe and what to discard.As a scientist it is easy to forget that there are many non scientists who are brilliant people, but who without the knowledge of science may tend to believe that their religion is the only help to solve their demand for an answer to life.<br />I have just bought a copy for my 10 year old grandson and hope he will have it by his side as he moves up the ladder of his education. This book is not about religion, but about showing us that we do not need religion to get through life. Stand alone with a belief that we are able to see the wonderful world we live in with not tainted glasses-<br />I thoroughly recommend this for all ages.<br />Niels D Svendsen B.Sc,
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Those of you who complain about the acting, plot, and lack of depth of this film must have not watched the trailer before going to see it at the theatre or buying the dvd.  From watching the trailer, did you honestly expect a deep, philosophical movie? I thought the trailer made it obvious what kind of film it was.  I don't know how you had higher expectations and then were disappointed.  After seeing the trailers myself, I was surprised that the film had better acting and a theme I could find meaning in when I saw it at the theatre.<br /><br />  As movies go, this was a great success.  It produced a lot of profit from a tiny production budget.  It did not rely on special effects to 'make it' as so many films do now days.  It actually told a story about people without involving explosions or a wealthy, unrealistic lifestyle.<br /><br />  I could relate to the financial struggle of many of the characters.  The lead female had a positive role.  Her character was a respectable person, and surprisingly, so was Mike's.  In today's economy, you gotta respect a guy who does whatever it takes to pay the bills and pursue the dream.<br /><br />  I was thrilled by the dancing scenes of course.  What woman with a pulse wouldn't be?  I'm not accustomed to being in a room full of people when watching stuff like that, so I was blushing and giggling along with everybody else.  It was also funny to see \\"the Kid's\\" character as he realized what Mike did in the evenings.  Mike's scene in the Marilyn Monroe dress was funny. The role of Dallas was often cringe-inspiring.  He played sleazy very well.  The drug aspect was uncomfortable for me, but added flavor to the film, and a lesson.  It was hard to watch The Kid ruin his life, and realistic that his sister, though she loved him, just had to let him go.<br /><br />  As far as emotion goes, I found no lack there. Especially in the last half of the film, it was apparent on his face what Mike was feeling as he tried once again, to get a loan for his business, started feeling the emptiness of his friends-with-benefits relationship, and got tired of being pushed around and used by Dallas.<br /><br />  It surprised me that Mike's last dance scene, in the black tactical vest, was the hottest.  It wasn't very long, he wasn't showing as much skin as he had earlier, but there was just something memorable about it.<br /><br />  For those of you who wish to moralize, you should think about the way the film played out.  Yes, there is language and sex.  It begins as fun and glamorous, but as the film goes on, we are shown the rougher side, and the reality that depending on sex and drugs to make your life meaningful leaves you empty and ruined.  In the end, Mike chooses to leave it all behind and move to a more meaningful, fulfilling adult relationship and career (I assume from the ending.) Morally, I agree this is definitely not a film for the young and impressionable.<br /><br />  Overall, I found this film delightful escapism. In real life, there are politics, the economy, global issues, and daily life things to worry about. For the time that I was watching this, it had my full attention and I was able to forget all that stressful stuff.  That alone is worth it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am 57,  I figure that it is a good thing to learn something new and challenging. My 5 year old grandson plays too. It is great to see his mind work. We love the game. Enjoy!
B009DP9D6A|4.0|Not one of the best albums i have heard. It is still worth getting if you like deadmau5 it has a really good songs. The only one i dont like is failbait i guess its the rapping.
B008E374PO|3.0|This album disappointed me. Adam's last two albums just had a deliciously whimsical feel about them... There's almost exactly none of that here. Adam's style on this album is completely different; even his vocals are lower in pitch. It was so disappointing to me, in fact, that I wondered why it affected me so.<br />I thought about it for a while, and realized it was like the feeling of growing up.<br />The fun, whimsy, innocence, and magic of childhood gives way to adulthood, and it's hard to look back sometimes. Going from Adam's previous work, which brought me back to those innocent times, to this album, which is mainstream-pop and darker by comparison, produced in me a feeling that is eerily similar to that loss of innocence. Even the artwork for this album is darker than ATBAB. And it feels like the depressing end of an era.<br /><br />The most popular song, \\"Good Time,\\" is so ridiculously shallow lyrically that I'm a bit ashamed to say that I like it. And I really wish I knew why he incorporated the silly mainstream concept of stuttering into his music (\\"Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-old\\").<br /><br />In short: Adam's previous work made me feel good, even happy, but this album doesn't even come close for me.
032147404X|4.0|If your just starting digital photo you have to have this book. It has help out a lot and you don't need a degree in photography to understand it. Most books I first read go to much into theory and the art of it. But this book just shows you how to get good shots and begins the learning process.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I loved this book. Emotional, and very exciting. One of my new favorites. Totally worth my money! Its a must read!!!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I am enjoying this series as much as The house of night , well MORE THAN!! If you like teen romance, and mystical stories!
B009CPEOC4|5.0|Very good movie, About her last year on tour. Goes behind the scenes of her tour. Pretty interesting facts<br />  about her life and tour. She tells the story in brief on her childhood, mostly about her tour.<br />  If you like katy perry you will like this movie...Enjoy
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Tough shows hope in despair.  He doesn't claim that the educators and researchers he has tracked have found a magic bullet in character but only that they are moving in the right direction.  Instead he says that not only does character matter, but that parents and educators can shape character, improve quality of life, and break the cycle of poverty.  He also asks questions about the education of children of the affluent and well educated.  Could character development help these children too?  He develops many of the anecdotes well (almost too well as you wanted movie script endings where no such endings were forthcoming).<br /><br />He touches on but does not fully explore some of the political correctness challenges to raising character development as a path to better lives.  Saying inner city kids can benefit from character development sounds racist to someone who doesn't spend much time thinking about it.  In fact, my view is that if this stuff works it is criminal not to try it instead of things that don't seem to help.<br /><br />The one thing he neglects to mention is the extent to which education itself is merely a signal (similar to analysis by Michael Spence and others).  If so, maybe character development independent of education is an equally valid (provided alternative signals can be developed) to help people lead richer more rewarding lives.  In that sense, maybe both Charles Murray (who Tough criticizes) and Tough are focused on the wrong thing (getting a college education as an end in itself producing a significant public good).  To me the chapter on college was the most disappointing.  Maybe that can be Tough's next New York Time Magazine article . . . how much does higher education really matter?<br /><br />As a story within the story, I found the IS 318 chapter fascinating.  I've played competitive chess against some of the kids mentioned and the description seems very accurate.  As an aside the description of Yury Lapshun was a little over the top.  He is quite friendly . . . both a gracious winner and loser.  I am anxious to see the new documentary on IS 318, Brooklyn Castle, that was completed at the same time as Tough's research.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this book can elevate the issues raised to a more prominent place in our public discourse, it will have done a great service.
B001PPLIFU|2.0|Where do I start?<br /><br />1. Shortest Bond film ever.  At 106 minutes, it is the second Bond movie to be less than 2 hours long, and is 13 minutes shorter than 1997's \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" which was short of 2 hours by only 1 minute.  Given how painful QoS was to watch, this is almost a point in its favor.<br /><br />2. Confusing plot.  Three men wrote the script, and then a fourth was brought in.  A classic case of \\"too many chefs spoil the plot.\\"  ;-)  Bond moves from encounter to encounter without much sign as to why.  I do not like movies that spell things out for me, as I usually figure them out myself just fine, but there is nothing to figure out here.<br /><br />3. Shaky cam and fast cuts.  The scenes.  Move fast.  And the.  Camera cuts.  Quickly from.  One point.  To another.  (You get<br />the point.)  On top of the fast edits, the action scenes use hand-held cameras that are shaking a little *too* much to be natural.  Marc Forster clearly had some kind of \\"vision\\" for this movie that makes it literally painful to watch.  I have even tried to watch it from far back, and it's still hard to tell what's going on, especially in one scene (slight spoiler) where he ends up in a hand-to-hand fight with someone his build, height, and hair color/style!  The camera is jumping around so much and shaking when it isn't that you can't tell who is who!  (Spoiler end.)  Frankly, it looks at points as if the cameras were being operated by folks with Parkinson's who were also unfortunate enough to be epileptic and were suffering a grand mal seizure during filming.  (Absolutely total respect to those with Parkinson's and/or epilepsy!)<br /><br />4. Insulting plot.  This goes hand-in-hand with #2, but the point here is, in this movie that moves along with no point, it takes many, many nasty jabs at America and the CIA.  Only one CIA agent apparently has any integrity (guess who?) and the rest are all evil, evil, evil.  Yep, let's make the USA bad guys!  That seems to be vogue these days, sad to say...  I know Bond is British, but the producers *do* know who is the primary audience for these movies, don't they?...<br /><br />In short, this movie lets down Bond fans on many, many levels.  But it does pick up almost to the minute from where Casino Royale leaves off, and we can presume that Skyfall will continue from where this movie leaves off.  Hopefully, that movie will be better!ue these days, sad to say...

B003KVKQB4|5.0|How can the long-term assets of a society be transformed into short-term profits for unscrupulous corporates and investors? How can the sustenance sources of defenseless local economies be ruined to become huge profits for a handful of opportunists in the name of economic growth and development? Shock Doctrine explains all this with real life examples from history. A must read for every economist who want to be aware of intentional ideologies in economy pursuing hidden agendas.<br /><br />One more thing I want to add: In some cases, you don't need to make your hands dirty in order to profit from the massacres and disasters happening on our planet, like the huge-scale destruction of tropical forests in Indonesia. By just adopting a \\"don't know, don't question, don't care\\" policy, you can simply remain integrated in the asset-transfer and profit-sharing system, like the majority of the finance community. Someone else can do the dirty work for you which is more perceivable at the front of the profit chain, like operating gold mines in tropical forests against the wishes of local people.<br /><br />Some of these finance communities and institutes have codes for investment ethics. Check out yourself: How many of them mention social and environmental concerns even with a single word? Is it just by chance or ignorance that they usually forget to mention such concerns? Or is it a deliberate \\"don't know, don't question, don't care\\" policy?
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Very fun.  It's a nice little time killer.  Occasionally gets a little laggy, but other than that, no problems that I have seen.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|this game is really good u build your own little machine. but the only thing I have against it is that it doesn't have a lot of action it is more like build and watch
B0014BQQYS|2.0|I hate the narrow screen it takes away from the movie. The movie is great as far as the acting and the story goes all these wide screen movies should be made in HD so they fill the screen and add to the Quality of the picture.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I've been a Stone Sour fan since their self-titled record in 2002. Over the years they have grown with each record. Every album is a new experiment. Fresh. This record is no exception. By far HOGAB Part 1 is the most diverse record from the Stone Sour catelog. To me this record is a great mixture of something very dark and heavy. Unlike their previous effort (Audio Secrecy) which had more of a rock/pop vibe (don't get me wrong audio secrecy was an amazing record)they have created something very different. We all know this is a concept record with an original story written by Corey Taylor. While listening to the album in it's entirety all the songs transition beautifully into the next. Honestly, I could see this album put to screen or stage one day with the songs played in the background. Maybe Tim Burton would get in on this (hint, hint)! If you are a true Stone Sour fan you will love and respect this record. All I can say is buy it. Listen to it without skipping a track. Go to Stone Sour's website for the lyrics, listen and read along. You wont be disappointed. Looking forward to part 2. Another job well done by SS!

I overclocked to 3.8Ghz and have been stable at 34-45°C since without any issues. It was also nice that the whole thing fit PERFECTLY behind my rather high-profile RAM without the need to adjust anything. I was most worried about that, but it ended up not being an issue at all.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Definite similarity to SOG, but not quite. I preferred the characters in Reflected In You. The story line is slightly more believable. No Red Room Of Pain, just a male character that is very confident and masculine and all the things that come with success. The female is very familiar. I think most women can relate with her emotionally. I seriously can't put in down. I have my favorite \\"scenes\\" like limo ride after a night gone terribly wrong and his stop over to invite her to a charity function. So good!!! Can't wait for the next book release. I hope the passion continues.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun I have been waiting for this app to become free of the grasp of apple apps.  I'm so happy this is on amazon now, I'm so happy.<br /><br />GET THIS GAME, ITS ADDICTING!!
B005BV0BA2|5.0|The last true classic maiden cd.  This cd was the one that shed a whole new light on maidens music for me yes maidens first 5 cds sound sonically superior(mainly due to the lack of keyboards getting in the way) but they are also lyrically inferior.  This cd combines classic maiden sonics with smarter lyrics and a lil more of a prog influence this truly adds to this bands legacy, for me more than any other release of their career.  This was their last consistent album before they broke up (oringal line up, which eventually reunited) and although the cds to come haven't been as good overall they continued the trend of smarter lyrics and their has been at least an amazing song or 2 per release from here on out.  Don't get me wrong its not my favorite but if you like the first 5 maiden cds at least give this one a chance before you write it off your likely to at least enjoy a song or two u might even fall in love with maiden all over again.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Exactly what I put in the title above. I am enjoying this game immensely. Great free app of the day a week or so ago.
B008V59AFW|4.0|The 2012 remaster on it's own is perfect. The sound is awesome, even better than the 2002 one. The only sore point is the omission of those cherished 12\\" singles and b-sides that every good 80s album should have. Hopefully Mr. Gabriel will take note and supply his eternal fan base with a special cd or download of all the missing stuff.
0446573027|2.0|I'll give it two stars simply because the story towards the end was somewhat exciting. However the main character John Puller bordered on the preposterous.  Mr. Baldacchi,  I don't know with whom you are consulting regarding training and capabilities of soldiers, but they are blowing smoke up your butt.  At one point or another in this story our hero W2 Puller (1) has as an Army Ranger fought on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan (several times) resulting in many wounds and a chest full of medals including two Silver Stars, (2) then transferred to Army CID to become not only an investigator but the top investigator in the entire US Army, (3) is a medical technician, (4) has an intimate knowledge of the human body including the ability to name specific bones in the neck, (5) is  a trained EMT who carries around bags of saline and necessary gear to begin an IV in his rucksack, (6) is a sharpshooter who can place a pistol bullet in the back tire of a moving motorcycle and, even better, shoot a bad guy in both arms without hitting any arteries with a MACHINE GUN!, and (7) best of all, kill one of the bad guys with his iPod which has been sharpened to the sharpness of a K-Bar knife.  Along the way, he turned down a couple of promotions, I guess so that Mr. Baldacci could demonstrate Puller's humbleness.  Jack Reacher can't hold a candle to this guy.  Thankfully,  I borrowed this book from the library and didn't waste money buying it but, in the end, I sure wasted my time.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Originally when I read the book summary I thought it had a lot of promise.  Within the first 50 pages I found I didn't like the main female protanginist and the further I read into the novel the story line became more far fetched.  I read the book on kindle and found myself skipping through chapters and unable to complete reading the last third of the book.  I've preferred other Gillian Flynn books more.
0446580848|5.0|Another great book from Nelson DeMille.  As with most John Corey stories, I start out laughing immediately.  I was concerned about this book because I was not as thrilled with the last two books as I had been in the past.  This book however is great.  As per usual, it's a page turner and the ending does not disappoint.  Unfortunately now I have to wait another year or so for the next one.  If you are a fan you won't be disappointed.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I see all the other reviews. like one star. when I bought it there were only 5 stars.  well I got to levvel 40 had 23 cash and glitch. I lost 20 thatbi earned from prospecting field.  Common people.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|If you are a fan of Supernatural you will love this season as much as you have enjoyed the previous 6. It's more chills and thrills, ups and downs and adventures around every corner. It's 23 episodes and added scenes that we didn't get to see on TV. I think anyone who enjoys the series will be happy with this Season 7 DVD set. I own them all and have been thrilled with them all.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|i loved it i cant wait for the 3rd one to come out. loved the twist. i couldnt put it down.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|another great book  have read all her books since i read her first one  hard to put down and very interesting story
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am very happy with this app.  It gives me a comprehensive update whenever I want.  The display presents the information in a way that lets me have an overview or drill down for more when I am looking for specifics.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the best game ever this game has never gotten boring for me! Everybody should give this game a 5 star rating. This game is one of the best games ever get this game so fun! :-)
0525953728|5.0|great story-well told. this is an account one can believe. no ax to grind, just grabs you from the first page...even when you think you know how it ends. thank you mark owen!
B007OWRBJK|4.0|This book is a brutally honest autobiography from a rock legend.  He obviously kept detailed diaries through the years which helped him reconstruct over five decades of rock and personal history.  The book is filled with encounters with other great music legends that are too numerous to mention here.  I did not realize he worked at such a punishing rate, but this book just reinforced my belief that most people who succeed are extremely driven.  This book is a great read which I would recommend to rockers, artists, and anyone who has battled demons or harbored self doubts (which is everyone). Thanks to Pete for this great gift of insight into your successes and struggles.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades Trilology was a great book! I am 21 years old and LOVED it! Aside from all the sexual encounters, it has a great love story line from the begining all the way up to the end of the third book! Read the trilology in a week. Couldn't put the book down it was so good and very educational if I might add!! I look forward to re-reading it many many times!!!
B00786XVOG|3.0|A good concert and worth the price. But, no where near as good as his first concerts were in Greece, India, China or his latest in Las Vegas.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I found out about WOOL from a Facebook friend, who recommended it highly. And boy am I glad she did! Post-apocalyptic and dystopian literature doesn't come much better than Mr. Howey's five novel series(with more to follow, as well as the preguels FIRST/SECOND SHIFT).<br /><br />From WOOL's ominous beginning - a recently widowed sheriff volunteers for \\"cleaning\\" - to its revealing conclusion, the author fills each page with characters that grow from accepting the status quo to questioning everything they've been led to believe about how and why they live the way they do. Even the 'villain' of the piece is motivated by what he thinks is right - and a part of me understood why he acted the way he did.<br /><br />Mr. Howey's writing is superb; his descriptions of life underground are both real and affecting, and his action scenes gripped me with their authenticity and pace. In WOOL, mankind's future is as bleak as Cormac McCarthy's THE ROAD, but the hope Hugh Howey offers at the end makes following Juliette's journey a sign that maybe, just maybe, we can make amends for our mistakes.<br /><br />Read WOOL. Please.
B0063IH60K|5.0|POPULAR GAME THAT STILL HASN'T LOST IT'S APPEAL!  LOVE THE WAY THE CARDS MOVE AND THE ABILITY TO REPLAY A GAME.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|so many dirrent options and settings, including multiple days. even when I forget to set it, it will ring for me!<br /><br />reliable
B007THA4FI|3.0|It's no Harry Potter.  Characters are not particularly engaging - they're dull.  Sorry I paid good money for it.  I just expected more.  I'm hoping as it goes on it will become more engrossing, right now it's very slow paced.  I realize this book was written for adults but adults like a bit of excitement and characters they can relate too.
0316228532|4.0|If you are looking for a book like Harry Potter, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />My only critique would be that Rowling seems to have tried too hard to stray as far from the Magical World of Harry Potter and it's happy endings as possible.<br /><br />However, on its own, this book is quite good.  She has a knack for well-developed, believable characters, even if you don't particularly like the characters. This book deals with drug abuse, confused teens, unhappy marriages, amongst many other facets of human unhappiness. While certainly not a \\"feel-good\\" book, it is very well done, and I would recommend it to adult readers.<br /><br />(Side note: DO NOT buy this for your children simply because they are fans of Harry Potter, it has very mature themes and can be very upsetting)
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This Product was amazing! And for this price you would be stupid not to purchase it.  it arrived on time no issues, ive watched the season twice in preparation for the 3rd season.  this is an absolute buy for fans of the show.  100/100
B007TKT2SK|5.0|it was a great app I love it being a high school student where we need to do problems involving fractions almost every day it is great!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love the game just wish they would give more coins. The game is over so quickly you have to wait till the next day to get more coins.  Even when the coins drop you don't get many to keep playing.  You need to upgrade it better.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I heard the author interviewed on NPR and knew I had to read her book.  Cheryl Strayed is a great new voice for women writers and her book is a thrilling account of walking the Pacific Coast Trail.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|The remastering of this CD was done very well, also the bonus disk is very good. If like the Doors this is your disk!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Game of Thrones is a well-written piece of work that has powerful characters and a compeling plot, just like this book that I read [[ASIN:B009U276VU Extracted (Book 1 of The Pioneers Saga)]]
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Anyone who buys the DVD is in for a disappointment. The deleted scenes, particularly Matt Bomer's Ken Doll strip sequence, is ONLY ON THE BLU RAY! It is nowhere to be found on the DVD. Don't waste your money on the dvd. I don't own and can't afford either a HD TV or a Blu Ray player.  This was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Not all of us has a blu ray. Some of us can't afford one. Why would the powers that be market it this way? Frankly, I'm not even sure that the Blu ray has the Ken Doll sequence at all. At least not in it's entirety. THIS SUCKS!!!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I loved Something Borrowed, and Something Blue was just the perfect sequel. I liked that we now got to follow Darcy (who we were constantly rooting against in Something Borrowed). I loved this story and couldn't put the book down! I do wish that we'd gotten to see a little more of Dex and Rachel in this one, but I understand that this was Darcy's story. Either way, I loved the way it turned out. I wouldn't object to reading a third installment, Emily Giffin. ;)<br /><br />Definitely recommend.
B008NEMPTO|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised ! This is one of the best vampire movies I've seen in a long time. I would highly recommend buying or renting this film. I thought this would be foolish and absurd, but just the opposite. Great effects, great acting, great flick.<br />I'm glad I bought this movie.
B000VRWRMQ|1.0|The rest of it is made up of somewhat interesting hooks, unfortunate timing changes and lyrics an orangutan on Rohypnol probably could have come up with.  Ugh and he's the talented one.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|LOVE THESE ACTRESSES AND THEIR CO-STARS!  THEY DO ALL THE THINGS PREGNANT COUPLES DO - OVER AND OVER.  I WATCHED IT WITH MY PREGNANT FRIEND AND SHE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED WHILE I GROANED AT CLICHE AFTER CLICHE.  YOU KNOW THEY SAY ABOUT CLICHE'S?  THEY'RE TRUISMS.  IF YOU'RE PREGNANT, WATCH IT FOR A GOOD LAUGH.  IF YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT SPEND YOUR TIME ON SOMETHING ELSE.
B0081BU42O|4.0|This is another fine novel in the Culture series. The details of a civilization's Subliming are central, and it is great to have that dimension of the IMB's brilliantly delineated universe filled out in greater detail. The plans, actions and reactions of a group of ship Minds are central (with some explicit nods to the Interesting Times Gang of Excession). In the end, I felt that the writing and plotting were a bit more perfunctory than in other novels in the series. The drama is undermined a bit: the novel is driven by the search for a piece of information, but the Minds involved keep noting that it is probably useless. Sure, there is a \\"point\\" to be drawn from this: perhaps that, once enacted, the move to Sublime transcends the petty machinations of politics and (heavily) armed conflict. Maybe there's a meta-commentary on the nature of fiction here. But that makes the story less rather than more engaging. I was so blown away by Surface Detail that I can almost imagine IMB having taken a bit of a breather with this more straightforward quest for a suitably posthuman MacGuffin.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Just downloaded that app, and let me juat say that it is amazing! A great additional game to Angry Birds is what this is!
B0001I55OC|3.0|This is a curate's egg of a movie- an excellent cast, experienced and successful director and good action scenes meet up with a lame screenplay, dreadful script and mindboggling lack of credibility. Who wins? You'll have to watch it to find out whether, for you, the good outweighs the bad.<br /><br />A hint might be that I'd certainly have given it no more than 2 stars, maybe even only one, had it not been for the special features. The documentary on the making of the film is a riot, far more entertaining than the movie itself. Donner comes into his own as he interacts with the cast, crew and the audience. It made the few dollars I spent on the movie more than worthwhile.
B00005V9IL|2.0|I was so disappointed about this version of the film do to the fact that it is not in 2.35 to 1 Anamorphic. To say Anamorphic and it is really full screen 1.33 to 1 is a blatant lie. A movie like this should never be in TV full screen which in itself contrary to reality. To me full screen is full 2.35 to 1 Anamorphic. It should not be based on TV screen sizes any more. Also the old style screen of 1.33 to 1 is now gone. It's time to change the wording and simply say Anamorphic or non Anamorphic.<br /><br />There are more than one size in Anamorphic. Cinema Scope is originally 2.35 to 1, narrow Anamorphic is 1.85 to 1 on<br />the screen but not necessarily in Anamorphic, but Ultra Panavision 70mm is 2.85 to 1. True Cinerama is 3 to 1 using three camera's to do the filming and three projectors to show the film in the theaters. Often times a film may be shot in 1.33 to 1 with the camera pulled back from the actors and sets and in the theater a black mask comes up from the stage and one comes down from the top creating a phony Anamorphic view of the movie. 1.85 to 1 is often shot in standard 1.33 to 1 and masked in the theater to show a wider image.<br /><br />The Abyss is a great movie of which I like allot, but I will not by another copy if it is not in true Anamorphic<br />2.35 to 1. The copy division who made the DVD's should have known better.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Halloween is without a doubt,one of the best Horror movies ever made.The acting,the story,the characters,the musical score...everything is top-notch.The sequel wasn't bad either,but compared to this,in NO WAY did it measure up.But still... It wasn't bad.Unfortunatly,the rest of the films in the series,got worse and worse.Including the non-sequel garbage that was Halloween III.There should have only been two Halloween movies made...and that's of couse this one,and Halloween II.Overall,Halloween will stand the test of time and go down in history as one of the best films ever.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|well its like the oposeght of angrey birds so well my daughter loves pigs so she thought it was awesome!!!!!!!
B0089BSM70|4.0|Halloween II would have closed out a really good story.Michael Myers and Dr.Loomis die at the end,and Laurie survives.That should have been the end of it.But we get crappy sequel upon crappy sequel,and one film that wasn't EVEN a sequel in Halloween III.Michael Myers also gets more and more supernatural and unrealistic as the series goes on.Why couldn't they just have ended the series with this film,where Michael Myers,an ordinary psycho killer finally gets killed off.Nothing supernatural or fake,but something that could really happen.Anyway,Halloween II is a good Horror flick,taking place the same night as the first film,with Michael Myers going after his sister Laurie,once again,but this time at the hospital.The storyline is good,so is the acting.Overall,Halloween II is good,but the original is alot better.I highly recommend buying Halloween and Halloween II together and not even bothering with the terrible sequels.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I am very pleased with the cover.  It is lightweight and durable. It protects the kindle from scratches or from damage if dropped.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Somewhat entertaining, but the action sequences tend to be repetitive. It was not very climactic and a bit of a let-down.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|Beautiful film<br />Well directed, shot beautifully, hair makeup and wardrobe fanastic<br />A great story told from wallas Simpson possible point of view<br />I loan it to everyone
B004VMUS9G|5.0|quick to set up and it's great I can wake up to my own music rather can a conventional alarm clock. by the way.  a trick is. just leave your kindle on the opposite side of the room then you have to get up
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Not all my favorite types of games work well,  if at all, on my Kindle Fire, but this hidden object game is perfect, one of the few good ones.<br /><br />It has a complete, creepy mystery to solve, mini games, great animated sequences to bring you into the story...and my favorite feature! An unlimited Hint button all the way thru, except during the mini games.<br /><br />I wish I could find another like it.
B007THA4FI|1.0|After all of the hype I was anticipating reading this novel. Found it difficult to follow and sadly went onto other books after about 100 pages.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game is very fun. My 3 year old loves playing it. The only thing is it is difficult at first until you save up enough to buy other characters. There are bonuses you can collect daily so it is not like you HAVE to spend real money to get new characters. You just have to be patient. Highly recommended! Very Cute!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|it is really fun I like find it games. it is easy to play and has good instructions thanks all
B000OVLINI|5.0|This intricate tale of discovery weaves itself together into a wonderful tapestry that only becomes completely visible in the final 100 pages.  Although the translator makes some small mistakes, especially as they concern specific Catholic words (e.g. the Spanish seminarista is rendered seminarist rather than the more appropriate seminarian), he does a tremendous job in conveying the beautiful metaphors of the original work.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Not much more can be said about this movie than has already been said about it.  The movie is a comic book come to life, perhaps the first of its kind.  Marvel has spent the past 4 years developling their Cinematic Universe, resulting in this masterpiece that recently even came under fire from Christopher Nolan's cinematographer (not understanding all that, but it was disregarded).  What started as mentions of SHIELD and Captain America's shield in Iron Man in 2008, culminated in a cameo appearance by Nick Fury who actually name-drops The Avengers.  Now, in 2012, we get a team up picture featuring the solo characters from their own franchises:  Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and Captain America.<br /><br />One liberty taken for this movie was character development, but remember, Marvel developed these characters over the course of 4 years, giving the main characters their own movies to develop character and give the origin stories required to explain who everyone was.  That said, it is strongly recommended that you watch Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger before you sit down to enjoy this movie.  It will help with your understanding of why the characters are where they are and why they are doing what they are doing.  What results is a witty, action packed movie that fully entertains the entire time.  There are moments that can be nitpicked, such as Thor's appearance, which negates the finale to his own film, and no mention whatsoever of the other hero, War Machine, who was introduced and used by the US government in Iron Man 2 during an alien attack of New York, but those are moments that do not ruin the movie completely.  Memorable scenes you will walk away with are the Hulk's handling of Loki, the team coming together culminating in Captain America's marching orders to each person, and a couple more, now tradmark, post-credits scenes.<br /><br />Of course we were bound to get a mega combo pack, something that came in theform of a Blu-Ray 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital/Soundtrack (and also a regular combo pack and single DVD and Blu-Ray releases), maybe the first of its kind to have so much together at once.  The special features are actually not as great as you would think or hope, although there is a commentary by writer/director, Joss Whedon.  There is no 'Making Of' feature, outside of a couple short moments discussing the actors and the formation of the team through the course of the 4 year period developing the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  A Marvel One-Shot short film, Item 47, is present, featuring characters from the movie, and set within the MCU, and it does not disappoint.  Also featured are some deleted scenes that, for example, shed light on Captain America's acclamation into present day society.  However, it was briefly mentioned before the release that there may be a Director's Cut of the film, with as much as 30-40 minutes of deleted scenes added in to the movie, but sadly, this is no where to be seen on this giant release.  Does this mean Marvel will double-dip with a further release in the future?  The answer is probably a resounding yes, which is unfortunate for people who bought this thinking it would be the ultimate release.  But, this movie has made loads of money, both from its release in theaters and from the home release, so it goes to stand that it would make even more with a further release of all-new material at some point in the future.  Other highlights include a digital copy (which is curiously not present on either the other Blu-Ray packs or solo Blu-Ray or DVD releases) and the soundtrack download, a cool code that allows you to get the entire soundtrack from online, for free.  This combo is packed to the gill with stuff, just not everything that could have been, or that was even discussed before the final release.<br /><br />That all said, definitely get a combo pack to enjoy the film in either all its Blu-Ray glory, as this movie is fantastic seen on 1080pand with a full audio surround sound transfer.  Despite the shortcomings of the home release, get this movie and share with friends and family, whether they've seen it already or not (and chances are they have seen it), this will only get better with age.  And we'll all be in line again waiting for Marvel to show else they have their sleeve, from a further release of The Avengers on Blu-Ray, all the way to Phase 2 beginning with Iron Man 3 in 2013.
B009UQCD0K|5.0|At this point in the series, everybody in the group is hardened to the world around them. Nobody hesitates anymore, and they work great together as a team. At the end of the lst episode, we were greeted by a few new characters, namely some convicts in the prison who had holed up in the cafeteria. Well, basically, this episode highlighted just how cohesive and necessarily ruthless Rick and the group could be when their survival is one the line (which it is every day). There was one scene in particular, prefaced by the quote, \\"I know....s#$% happens.\\" Well...no doubt about that. Probably my second favorite scene after the bar scene in the episode \\"Nebraska\\" from last season. This show went from crazy uncertainty to idle development, but now we're in hardcore mode and I am loving it. Dirty, gritty, and necessarily violent. Everything I hoped it could be, and this episode lived up to that.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|There's really nothing to say about this movie. It stinks from the tedious beginning and becomes totally unwatchable unless I suppose you're 8 years old.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The movie was much better than the book, which was boring from the start.  I would be inclined to watch more movies in the series, should they be made.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|This book is the third in the series. Could be read alone but much better in sequence. There is a lot of descriptive detail but the story line is really interesting and I have enjoyed it very much.  I would highly reccommend this series of books to anyone interested in fantasy reads.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Truely amazing and realistic sounds you can mix and match for your full enjoyment.  Was pleasantly surprized that you can taylor each sounds volume within the selection.  For example, you can tone down a rainstorm while increasing a cat's purr.

B0052REUW0|5.0|I'll start with a disclaimer: I absolutely love Pinker's work, both stylistically and content-wise. I love his wit and, with some exceptions, I'm mostly sold on his worldview, so I can't really be expected to be unbiased.<br /><br />Having said that, here's why I decided this book deserves 5 stars (and my very first review): it's the first non-fiction book in a loooong while that managed to give me some hope for mine and my (virtual) offspring's future. TBAOUN is no New Age wishlist, and you won't finish reading this believing that everything's wonderful and full of rainbows and unicorns. Still, the evidence Pinker brings to support his point is pretty convincing - I know there are many who'll disagree with his conclusions, but I have yet to see someone who can bring more solid evidence to the table.<br />The one thing that might stop you from reading TBAOUN is its considerable length - 800+ pages aren't really something most people are confortable with, when there are no vampires or hobbits involved. Still, I found it to be a non-issue: while I doubt you can define it a \\"page-turner\\" with a straight face, it's as close as it gets, for an essay about war and murder and other atrocities.<br /><br />To be honest, I have no idea if Pinker has any chance of convincing someone who is fundamentally opposed to his world view. Most \\"true believers\\" (adhering to either extreme left- or right-wing ideologies, or religious fundamentalists of any sorts) will find a lot of stuff they won't like and possibly offend them, and I doubt they'll agree with the conclusions anyway, so probably they're better off reading something else. Anybody else, though, should really give TBAOUN a chance: it's really that good.

B000FVE3AC|5.0|I just received this watch after much research and thought behind purchase.<br />I had heard mixed reviews of Invicta.  I am a professional diver and operate a shark diving company in California.  I am in the water a lot!  I have a passion for good dive watches under $500.00.  I own them all (except a Rolex of course)...Seiko (Orange Monster), Bulova (Marine Star), the list goes on and on.<br />If (I hope) first impressions hold, I have to say I am VERY impressed with this watch.  The size, weight, movement, look, and feel all tell me this is a quality watch.  Even though it is heavier than my Seiko OM, it is more comfortable on my wrist and the look far surpasses many of my other nice dive watches.<br />I am planning on making this my new \\"go-to\\" every day and every dive watch.  I'll update my review again after I put this big bad boy to the test in the ocean.  But, so far so great...and I love this watch!

B005ERIRZE|4.0|This books starts off strong and is full of interesting facts on the physiology of the brain and human evolution of what we call willpower. The concepts of building better habits are insightful and I enjoyed the exercises.  The second part of the book adds more real-life examples/stories that I skipped due to the predictable outcomes. That being said I did read the stories that seemed relevant to me. I recommend this book to any one who wants to learn some tips on developing more self-control. I  found the author‘s scientific research approach particularly appealing.

B000UD0ESA|5.0|Blade Runner in my opinion is a Masterpiece.I feel that it is one of the best if not the best Science Fiction films ever made,in the time it was made plenty of the special effects that film makers use today were not available yet Ridley Scott created not only a visually stunning film but a thought provoking one and one that lingers in your mind after viewing it.
1451678193|5.0|The Martian Chronicles was the first science fiction book I read. I was twelve years old and the paperback was .99 cents, so I convinced my mother to buy it for me. And I fell in love with Bradbury's prose in The Martian Chronicles; it is almost poetry and a joy to read. I've since read every science fiction, and every other story he published. Bradbury's novels and short stories all make subtle, but accurate, commentaries on modern American culture. I recommend his works to anyonre who loves good story telling and beautiful prose.

0307593495|2.0|I listened to an audio recording of the book which is the only reason I finished it. I read one previous Wallander story some years ago and remembered liking it. This however, is just a mess. Perhaps if you've followed all the Wallander saga (this was the 11th book) you'll like to know how he handles his last case. But if you've liked the character you won't like this. Wallander is feeling his age. He's 60, which doesn't seem that old to this 61-year-old, but Wallander carries his age like a vast burden. He's sick (diabetes which he isn't treating properly) and suffering frightening memory losses. It's clearly affecting his work. With out giving anything away I'll say it took remarkably long to solve this case. The audio is on 14 CD, which is pretty long. At the beginning of the 13th CD, the case seemed no closer to resolution than in the 1st.<br /><br />If this is your introduction to Kurt Wallander, I'd recommend starting at the beginning. Accounts are that earlier books were good. I'd skip this one all together.

B0067QPVJ6|1.0|Comparing the 2011 \\"prequel\\" to the 1982 original is like a masterclass in the difference between modern Hollywood and even the Hollywood of just a few decades ago.<br /><br />The Thing (1982) was a gory horror/sci-fi film aimed mostly at teens and nerds (or both, like me)  but it has great performances, edgy dialogue, and truly frightening and disturbing scenes.<br /><br />The Thing (2011) has interchangeable characters who might as well not even have names, by-the-book CGI, no atmosphere, and no suspense. It barely even has the jump-scares that normally Hollywood can be expected to deliver.<br /><br />In 1982, Kurt Russell scraped hot wires in petri dishes of blood to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.<br />In 2011, Flavor of the Month Actress #7209 shone a flashlight into the other characters' mouths to see if they had fillings to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.<br /><br />'Nuff said.

1423140605|5.0|I was at the Natural History Museum with a Cub Scout pack and talked to an intern there who was absorbed in this book, she loved it. Later that day I asked my son what the next book was that he wanted to read, it was this book. He's been spoiled by this series and we had a hard time picking out books to follow.
159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver's book is useful, valuable, and important.  To my mild disappointment there are few equations, and in places there is more verbiage than necessary.  Nonetheless, the book is an easy and enjoyable read that outlines several important but seldom discussed aspects of decision making, modeling, and simulation.<br /><br />Examples are drawn from baseball, politics, investing, terrorism, climate change, chess, poker, pattern recognition, earthquakes, and economics.  Broadly, the points he makes include:<br />* Think in terms of probabilities.<br />* Be aware of biases.<br />* Consider subjectivity and objectivity.<br />* Recognize that the signal is hidden in the noise.<br />* Estimate uncertainties.<br />* Be aware of the tails of the distributions.<br />* Keep your models dynamic.<br />* Use Bayesian techniques to modify the model and its predictions as additional data is received.<br />* Beware of overfitting models to data.<br />* Out-of-sample validation is mandatory.<br /><br />Readers of my books and articles (visit the Blue Owl Press website) will understand my enthusiasm for Silver's book -- my materials could be the laboratory manuals for applying his concepts to trading systems.  Although I do have one serious quibble -- he recognizes the ARIMA-style trend-following model, but ignores mean reversion -- I highly recommend \\"The Signal and the Noise.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Howard Bandy<br />author of \\"Quantitative Trading Systems,\\" \\"Modeling Trading System Performance,\\" and the forthcoming \\"Mean Reversion Trading Systems,\\" all available from Blue Owl Press
0525958002|3.0|I've been a fan of Duran Duran since 1985 so I was looking forward to this book for well over a year after it was announced.<br /><br />I got my copy yesterday and started reading it last night.  I admit I am a bit impatient; I was very curious about what was going on in the band behind the scenes since the original members got back together in 2002, so I skipped to the last few chapters.  I was extremely disappointed with those sections. What, six pages???  JT totally skimmed over those years.  I would have like to have read in detail the exact accounts behind the drama that I've read in the press, in Andy and Mailin's book concerning those years.  How did relations btw Andy and the band break down.  What was going on with Reportage?  JT's feelings about working with Timbaland, Timberlake, the ever-changing record company and Mark Ronson.  JT had very negative to say in the press about those T&T recordings but no mention of it in his book.  I wished JT had written those passages with the same thorough detail that he did with the earlier part of the book.  Maybe there will be a volume 2 of the book someday.<br /><br />In regards to Sterling Campbell, this book contains some detail about his involvement with the band and his departure which the band have been very silent about.<br /><br />One thing that did stand out to me, the way JT lists out his bandmates' names, either Andy's name is mentioned at the end of the list or not at all, that tells me JT hates Andy.  They seemed so tight when they did the first Power Station album back in the 80s.

0385535147|5.0|I have waited for a while for this one to be released, today was the day. I bought this on Kindle this am and could not put it down. I am always amazed with this author but this  is one of his best. Great story line and really gets you pulled into the action.Some very interesting characters and lots of surprises towards the end of the story. What an imagination,I have never been disappointed with any of his books. I will tell my friends about this one and suggest it as an excellent read.Can't wait for the next one. Also I was surprised that the leading characters are black, I guess that shows the depth of the author to be able to write from a totally different perspective. This one could be made into a movie, there could be some great scenes from the islands..
0425263916|5.0|The love that these two share is so overwhelming that takes a tole on their relationship. His reluctanctance to tell her about himself gets in the way a lot as well as his overprotectivness for her. She is always fallng back into her old patterns because of her doubt. I was seriously angry most of the book. I wanted to smack them both, but truth be told they love eachother more than they love themselves. It's a beautiful stroy and I can't wait for the ending. The end has a twist, but It's so worth reading. Love it!

B008G8SFGO|1.0|I was listening to some older KISS off of LOVE GUN, Rock-N-Roll Over, Destroyer and such and thought what a great band they were at the time so I am very glad they have samples here. What a load of repetitious crap! Am a long time KISS fan but KISS really has not released anything as of late worth listening to. Gene is out of ideas as ALL his songs sound the same and have absolutely no appeal at all. Paul is the only hope of a good writer anymore but even he has lacked in real creativity and all his songs lack any luster and catchy appeal. All the samples I have heard from munster are junk and is another album I will pass on. Nothing like hearing the same sounding songs over and over again when the songs are crap.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|A futuristic Robinson Crusoe! Due to a dust storm, Mark Watney is left for dead in the Acidalia region of Mars when the Ares 3 mission is aborted 6 days into the scheduled two months. What follows is largely a logbook of living in a large tent or a small rover for about 550 days on what was supposed to be two month's rations for 6 people. Fortunately there were some potatoes for thanksgiving that were alive, so Mark starts dividing them and growing them. But first he has to make soil, and then water, and so on. Generally speaking, a logbook is a poor technique, but here it is brilliant. You cannot have conversation, and you cannot develop other characters, but did I mention he was abandoned? Alone? You might still think that 550 days stuck in a tent or rover could get boring, but no, this book is absolutely gripping.<br /><br />Watney was resourceful, and the book is very good at showing the scientific approach to problems, putting numbers to them, and showing what happens if you do what, so in a sense it is also a book of puzzles: this has gone wrong, how can it be fixed? Tension is maintained well because Watney has an unseen companion: Murphy. If it can go wrong, it does, sometimes because of Watney's own lack of knowledge. To make water, first he makes hydrogen. This is not a good idea, and Watney finds out why. Because I have also written a book centred on Mars, I know the author has really spent a lot of time understanding the nature of Mars, and this book shows quite well what being on the surface of Mars would be like. There is the odd error, probably intentional for effect, for example the effects of the dust storm are too great. Martian winds can hit up to 200 k/h, but gas pressures are about 1% of Earth's, so, after correcting for the lower gravitational acceleration and the mass of dust, the forces will still be only a few percent of those of comparable wind velocities on Earth. That, however, is forgiven, because if the author were strictly correct on this, then there would be no story.<br /><br />To summarize, this is a surprisingly gripping story of survival against all the odds, and I strongly recommend it.<br /><br />Ian Miller, author of Red Gold.his, then there would be no story.<br /><br />To summarize, this is a surprisingly gripping story of survival against all the odds, and I strongly recommend it.<br /><br />Ian Miller, author of Red Gold.
0316228532|5.0|I was hooked, from beginning to end. Also, from a writer's point of view, this is an interesting book, breaking some tiresome rules. It is a bible on how to write a successful multi-POV story, and there is plenty of back story here and there, all in each character's POV, quite long at up to a page and a half, in brackets, and gossipy. I would highly recommend this story. Well done, JK Rowling.

Since I had a rather long car ride in my schedule, I made the decision to listen to this book which is a common method for me to absorb miles of driving. I was not disappointed in any way by the outstanding narrator who was able to capture my attention though every piece of dialogue and narration with his buttery smooth voice, and by the intensity of the story. It was a purely enjoyable experience and the miles vanished between home and my destination.

B0083V2W6I|4.0|I never got a chance to see the movie \\"Quadrophenia\\" when it was initially released, so when I heard that the Criterion Collection was cleaning it up for a DVD release I was excited ! I always enjoyed the album but was curious to see how the movie would tell the story of a young \\"Mod\\" Jimmy & his struggles with fitting in with his peers and growing up in 1960's England. The movie does not slavishly follow the track of the album but there are many common points that made me feel like everything rang true. The music of the album does (for the most part) occur in the course of the movie as well as other vintage WHO songs of the 60's era. If you have the album you know that it contains a large multi-page insert with grainey black and white photographs of all of the key characters at important story points. The movie does use different people from your album photo book, for example Jimmy's mother in the photo book is the famous Queen Elizabeth look-alike - where the movie features another actress. I won't try to tell the whole story, but I liked the world that the movie reveals and I am glad that I bought the DVD ! Thumbs up !
B000GBFQT8|5.0|The chronicles of Narnia is a book written by C.S. Lewis. The genre of this book is an adventure book.  The name of the book comes from four young children's lives in a somewhat parallel universe as ours. I would say that the theme of the book is loyalty to your family. I enjoyed this story very much. It  was a constant page turner for me. Every new page was sort of a new adventure for me and the characters alike. The story is written in a 3rd person point of view where the author not only tells of the story but talks to the reader as well. I enjoy this much more than a regular third person point of view. The authors voice to me sounds like an older man sitting by a fireplace telling you of this story that he came up with the previous night and was energetic to tell us. \\" There shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before, shaking his mane ( for it had apparently grown again) stood Aslan himself.\\" This is a quote from the book in which the author adds his own little thoughts, as if he were really telling us what was happening.<br /> The setting of the story takes place in a fictional world called Narnia. It is world filled with magic and mystical beings and talking animals. It is very much like the world we live in today with exception technology and regular humans. The writer makes you feel like your in the story. He does not use a lot of the seeing sense but much more of the others such as cold, harsh. hard, and pale. Narnia is mostly covered in snow and ice due to the Witch's rule. However there are parts of the land that are not affected. The parts that have not been affected by the cold is where her evil power has not yet reached.<br /> The main characters of the story are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy; going from oldest to youngest. Then there is of course the lion Aslan and the evil White Witch; the Queen of Narnia. You also have Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and a faun named Mr. Tumnus. Mr. Lewis put a good deal of detail into each of his characters,even the non important ones. As I said in the first paragraph the theme is about loyalty to your family, Edmund, the second youngest of the four, dishonored  his siblings and almost got them killed by a the Witch's police wolves.<br /> The story is essentially about the four children going into a magical wardrobe and ending up in a world called Narnia ruled by the Evil Witch. The kids are in danger and a very powerful lion comes and saves all of Narnia with the children from the Queen and restores balance among the Narnian world.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|Before I go to sleep is a brilliantly researched and compulsive read. I found the plot very believeable and the story gripping. I didnt expect the ending at all and I would recommend it as a great read.
1451695195|5.0|Normally, I avoid books about Near Death Experiences (NDEs).  It isn't that I dismiss the possibility.  It's just that few have anything other than subjective observations of their experience to offer the reader. But Alexander, who spent fifteen years on the faculty of Harvard Medical School as an associate professor of surgery with a specialization in neurosurgery, is not someone whose NDE account is easily dismissed.  Alexander spent seven days in a coma suffering from an extremely rare disease, E. coli meningitis, during which time he suffered a complete loss of neocortical functions - i.e., the part of his brain which makes us human was absent.<br /><br />The neocortex is that part of our brains involved in higher functions such as sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, conscious thought and language.  While Alexander's neocortex was completely shut down by the disease, he nonetheless experienced being conscious somewhere else.  For those who believe that the brain is the source of consciousness, as did Dr. Alexander prior to this experience, consciousness is thought to be impossible in the absence of a functioning neocortex.  Yet Alexander was conscious.<br /><br />Alexander's NDE caused him to rethink the relationship between mind and brain, concluding that the brain, rather than being the source of consciousness, is, in fact, a filter for consciousness.  Although many scientists will refuse to even consider the challenge which Alexander's observations raise to materialist orthodoxy, neither can they easily answer the questions his experience raise in both subjective and objective aspects.<br /><br />For those with theological training, such as myself (a priest in the Episcopal Church), Alexander's voyage is fascinating for other reasons.  Although Alexander is a life-long Episcopalian, he is, as many of us are, theologically unversed.  He uses language which differs significantly from classical theology and yet he describes an encounter with God which, I believe, will be recognizable to mystics of many traditions, including my own.  Speaking as a Christian, the Trinity is clearly recognizable in his account and, but for the language he uses to describe it, is entirely consonant with classical Christian mysticism.<br /><br />Alexander concludes that consciousness and love are fundamental to the structure of the universe, in and through and above it all.  This marvelous book has profound implications for science, philosophy and theology, as well as interfaith dialogue.  I recommend it as well worth the time spent reading and reflecting upon it.<br /><br />Fr. Joseph Farber+, Sapulpa, Oklahoma
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|I have to give a bad review cause it will not let me play :( I like these type of games but this one will NOT load.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Paul Tough does a good job bringing recent neuroscience and efforts to address critical social issues together in this book. If you have an interest in how early childhood experience impacts educational and vocational achievement, this book is for you. Recent work exploring 'grit' and other non-cognitive aspects of personality that predict achievement- and how to foster those qualities- is fascinating. Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very intense and romantic in its own way. would recommend to other hopeless romantics. a book u cant put down
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|we used this book for our high school senior.  it has really helped him understand his strengths and what he is good at.  we are using it to help determine what his major in college should be.  it seems it is really designed for an employee to assess his/her skills, but we think it is helpful for a 17 year old.  The online test is a must.
B000IZA9NK|5.0|Takes me back to the '40s when I was a kid (I was 6 years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed) & cartoon super heroes were a big part of my life. I didn't see many movie theater serials but of course they could not compare visally with this film. Within its genre I rate this film 5 stars. Of course it's not as good as, say, an Indiana Jones film - but that's only because Indiana Jones is not in it. Jude Law is not a charismatic character like Harrison Ford.is. Still, as entertainment, this is \\"5 stars\\" IMO.
B00821BLX4|3.0|I bought the tele and wide lenses for my Tough camera.  When they arrived, I discovered that I need this little adapter! No one told me when I was buying the lenses.  So I buy this tiny little adapter and discover that I have to wait over a month for it to be shipped from Hong Kong!  Now I have expensive lenses and no adapter until AFTER I come back from vacation!
B000T433CO|5.0|Okay, so it may not be hugely artistic or slapstick funny, but it's a great story and delightfully entertaining.  Jude Law is just adorable and so likable. I became a Cameron Diaz fan after seeing this.  And I have always loved Jack Black.  If you liked him in Shallow Hal, you'll love him in this. Kate Winslet never disappoints.<br /><br />I watched this with my college aged children and they loved it, too.  We've probably seen it 10 times and there are a bunch of lines in the movie that we quote often.
B007MDB548|5.0|My daughter ADORES the Disney Fairies franchise. This movie was such a great addition. \\"The Pixie Hollows Games\\" short was very good as well. This movie keeps in the spirit of the other movies, and if you are a fan I highly encourage you to get it.<br /><br />We try to get the digital copies because it helps to have them on our handheld devices while travelling. It's definitely a lifesaver!
B007704HO6|3.0|While I applaud the triumph that James has had overcoming his troubled, wretched life, and how Bob was a major player in his recovery and gaining back his self esteem and self worth, I still wanted to know more about Bob as himself - not just as James's saviour.  I adore cats and have a very peculiar connection with them, and I am quite sure that there is a heck of a lot more to the clever, crafty, funny fellow than James has had the time to record - hence only three stars!
0345803485|1.0|I can't add to any of these reviews.  This book was awful.  I've read better stories on bad fanfic sites.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Very thorough and enjoyable life story of one the most successful immigrants to the United States ever.  Arnold does a very good job of describing feelings, shortcomings, and challenges he faced.  I also found it very refreshing to see so much credit given to friends and colleagues that helped him along the way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this game for my phone and it is awesome so I think this will also will be awesome. A few weeks ago my cousins introduced me to this game and I say it is worth the money. If only it had signs.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Conflicts arise between natives and newcomers and between haves and have-nots.  Characters from every social class and age group emerge fully developed in JKR's capable hands.  Set in modern times and cold reality, it is very different from the Harry Potter saga.
B005FPT51K|1.0|Please -- do not get caught up in the hype: the fact that it is iOS compatible or that Apple carries this device in their stores. For the life of me I cannot imagine why. This is, stated as objectively as I possibly could, the worst electronic device I have ever used. The image freezes, the camera resets. I have attempted to contact their customer service. The quality of the service reflects that of the product *and* the manuals that come with it.<br /><br />In short, this is the least Apple-like device (so we are led to believe) that I have ever used. We are returning this item and going with something from Buy Buy Baby.<br /><br />So, bye bye, iBaby. May we be happier in your absence (and trust what we actually see on the screen!)
1401324649|4.0|Be warned,  you may have to read this book non stop. And, OMG!, a Scandinavian novel that is out and out hilarious. Some of the coincidences and last minute rescues are so absurdly over the top you can only laugh at them. I immediately sent it to a friend who loved it too, and told other people about it.
B008SA21N8|5.0|I have always really enjoyed Amazon instant videos. I have never had a problem with them.  And even if I do make an arrant purchase, Amazon always fixes it immediately for me.<br /><br />As far as Suits go, I think it is a great show and recommend that you check it out. I find the dialogue between Mike and Harvey thoroughly entertaining.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|As the final book in the trilogy I found this just as interesting as the first two. The books are well written, give a great deal of information about the Swedish Justice System and society in general. Having a friend who is in the process of publishing a book, the magazine, newspaper & book publishing information was interesting. It added depth to the whole story. I noted the repeated use of coffee as the social \\"tie that binds\\". Being of Norwegian descent, and originally from Minnesota, I remember that coffee was always the beverage of choice and all conversation started after it was served.<br />But to the story...our heroine Lizbeth is a bit hard to grasp, her skills, based partly on a photographic memory, are so far beyond me that I find it almost bordering on science fiction. It was once noted that she may have Asperger's, a form of autism. I would agree to some extent. My grandson has Asperger's and has some of the same retention abilities as well as the detached social skills. Lizbeth was subjected to so much trauma at a young age that could account for her ability to get out of herself in time and place. That doesn't keep it from being a gripping story. It is hard to remember at times who all the characters are and locations. Swedish names and place names are impossible for the American tongue to pronounce let alone remember.<br />I really like Erica Berger and Kalle Bloomqvist, well he is obviously one of those charming men that women find irresistible.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Came on time and in good condition.  I feel that it was fairly priced and I love the Walking Dead comic books and tv show.  I would recommend seeing both of them (they have different story lines).
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Excellent!  Excellent!  Brings back the excitement of superheros.  I loved the characters even the villain Loki.  Definitely a satisfying fantasy film that takes you away for a while.
0553801473|5.0|I love these books!  This one came in great condition and on time.  Really recommend picking this book up if you liked The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, and other stories, shows, books of that nature.

1469984202|4.0|I'm two thirds through the book and find myself wanting to keep reading.  Hugh Howey's description of the silo is so descriptive that I can picture the scenes that take place.  The section I'm in is getting more exciting with each chapter.  Should complete the book real soon now.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I decided to watch this movie when I came across it when doing a search for movies that fit into the halloween season. WOW!!! Now I am OBSSESSED! I always liked Gerard Butler, but WHO KNEW he could sing like that?! What a great love story! And the music and acting is awesome. This movie is the whole package for me...............I can't get enough of it!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I liked the game, it is very nice. I think it would be better if it had more games, But it´s OK!
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|An odd story with an endearing twist. Although the story deals with a very serious subject matter it is portrayed honestly and surprisingly finds humor in the darkest of places.<br />Well worth the investment of time.
B005HEW70A|5.0|While heading home from the Delta Quadrant Harry Kim has found a stationary wormhole. They have to change course to see if it is one they can pass through and perhaps find a shortcut back home. They arrive at the worm hole only to find that it is very small and caused by a micro singularity.  It is only 30 cm in diameter (A little less than one foot in diameter).  They won't fit through it but perhaps they can send a message back home. And to test this theory they send a micro probe through the hole. The worm hole may be ancient and been collapsing for centuries. The probe gets stuck but it is scanned by someone on the other side.<br /><br />The probe cannot free itself and will be crushed in 72 hours. They try to transmit a message to whoever is on the other side using the probe as a re-transmitter. They hope to transmit messages to home that they are alive. They send the signal and a response signal comes back. The signal is from the Alpha Quadrant, home!.....<br /><br />This is a very good episode and I enjoyed it a lot.  The writers spent a lot of time on this storyline and on the twists and turns in the plot.  I recommend this episode to you as a good one to view.
B007AJFSJW|3.0|Paul Krugman brings a wealth of experience and writing skilll to this subject. I thought his coverage was adequate BUT his solutions were either simplistic or NOT realistic in the arena of partisan politics and Presidential divisiveness apparent in Washington. A good read for those who wish to become more informed. Do NOT expect any or all of the recommendations to be enacted any time soon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app for the kindle fire! my little broo downloaded this app and then I deploy in love with it!!!!!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I really enjoyed the action of this movie. I have not seen previous movies that he has been in so have nothing to just him on, but he definitely has me as a fan now. It's much better than the newest one.
B0079M8R6Q|4.0|This is a really interesting account of one individuals view on North Korea - it is both informative and disturbing. A true story of survival and an interesting look at the impact this can have on a humans psychology.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very well written. Great read.I hope the author writes more books. I really enjoyed this trilogy.All the books are worth a read.
B004LROUW2|3.0|This was my first time reading a Haruki Murakami novel and I was looking forward to it. Im not usually deterred by lengthy novels but this was too long and about 2/3rds through I had forgotten certain characters and their relevance. And since I was reading on a kindle, it was too much work to go back and reread. I ended up reading a plot summary instead of finishing and it seems like a lot of important aspects of the novel are never explained. If the Q in 1Q84 stands for questions there needs to be a (shorter) sequel called 1A84 that has some answers! Im off to try another Murakami novel, Norwegian Wood.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very well written. Great read.I hope the author writes more books. I really enjoyed this trilogy.All the books are worth a read.

B007THA4FI|2.0|Nothing was happening that was exciting until the end of the book.  Character developement was lacking.  She should go back to Harry Potter type books.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Best movie ever!!! Is sad but impressive!! The actors were well chosen! A movie that must be seen...enjoy!<br />Awesome awesome awesome
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! Couldn't put it down! Loved the first book and feel the sequel has delivered! Will definitely read the third book too!
B004HD61KE|4.0|I'm not finished yet but it's great so far! I really like the sigma force series. There is a lot of great action and interesting plots.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw this at the theater and loved it! The acting is extremely believable but how could they miss with the cast that was chosen. I think all seniors will relate to at least one character, maybe even two. Your emotions will run wild and you may find yourself laughing out loud one minute and crying the next. At the end of the movie my friend turned to me and said it made her feel hope! I was feeling exactly the same way. I do not buy many movies but I could hardly wait for this one to come out on DVD. You will not be disappointed and will probably watch it over and over!
1439153663|5.0|Excellent book. Great description, it makes you feel like you are there. I just love it. I hope to read more books from this author.
B00914JWSW|2.0|I've been a big fan of Barbra's since the early '70s and was excited at the idea of this release of vault items. However, with the exception of a couple of tracks, one realizes why they didn't make the initial cut. The liner notes are very nicely done and as some other reviewers note, tantalize with the gems still locked away (the whole '67 Central Park concert! Release that please!!). Jimmy Webb's \\"Didn't We\\" is great, although in typical Streisand fashion she bends the rhythm waaaay out like taffy. \\"Glocca Mora\\" is beautifully done and restrained. My favorite Streisand period is from the late '60s when she no longer sounds like a little girl, but before some unwise moves into contemporary rock music during the 70s. I'm not a huge fan of her later Broadway albums as they are so over-produced and Barbara also has a tendency to \\"yowl\\" for lack of a better word -- just because you can hit the note doesn't mean you should. It just sounds vulgar; less is more. The track from \\"Hallejuah Baby\\" on this album being an example of what I mean. Ironically, as she has gotten older, this tendency has disappeared as she presumably finds it more difficult to belt those notes, yet the effect is often more lovely and restrained. The track \\"Gentle Rain\\" on her most recent studio album being a great example of this. More low-key and yet the voice is beautiful.<br /><br />Bottom line: for die-hard fans and completists only. Here's another vote for the full Central Park show and the 60s nightclub shows!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I'm absolutely mesmerized by this book that weaves together three different points in time in the lives of three generations of women in one family. It all revolves around a family secret and the story drops bits and pieces about the secret along the way and you never really find out what happened until the end. It's amazing how it's all woven together -- and so seamlessly. You'd think that having several narrators (I think there are something like 5 or 6 narrators at different points), that it would get confusing. But it doesn't.
B000I9YV12|5.0|This movie was clear as could be,i can watch it over n over in clear view will purchase more movies.thanks
B003ODIZL6|5.0|highly recommended it for it is really useful for second language learners who want to have close reading on English version novels.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I love my new case. The color is great! I love how you can use the case as a stand to watch something. I also love the weight of the case. It makes you feel like you are holding a real book. This was definitely a great buy!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie,I bought this at last minute for a birthday and it came very quickly. It was also much cheaper than in the stores
B0029ZA3H4|4.0|Gary does an excellent job of conveying his passion and enthusiasm for marketing product(s) and intellectual property through social networking on the internet. Like anything, once you've created success, you become the expert and the only left is to tell your story. Thanks, Gary. I'm pumped!!!
B008NABUU8|1.0|It was fun until it jammed my kindle. I wasn't able to turn it on. Don't get it! It's not worth it.
B0099G88BE|5.0|Deep Purple (with Blackmore) is still one of my all-time favorite bands. If someone had asked me what Deep Purple cover I'd ask for in a perfect world, I would have said Bonamassa doing Lazy. There are a couple other songs on here worth listening to but no one plays the blues like Bonamassa!
0385339089|4.0|I usually finish books fairly quickly, however, this one took me a little longer than expected. I felt it had a hot start, slowed down quite a bit, then ramped up again toward the end. I really enjoyed all the minute details Grisham includes...for me, it added a lot more reality to the story.<br /><br />The single most intriguing part of this story was learning allllll about Mark Sway. I found it amazing that Grisham could develop a character so well and expose so many different sides of him. He made it easy to visualize a story like this happening.. and made it easy to WANT to peer inside the mind of Mark.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|Love SOA!!! Love no commercials. Was happy I was able to purchase as soon as I finished season 1-3 on netflix
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a class act. Costumes, sets, lighting, and casting give an authentic feel to the 1920's-set British drama. Acting is superb. Writing is excellent. You can't ask for more.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love Pinterest and this app for my kindle fire is great! good find! wish I didnt have to open link to &quot;like&quot; or repin
0425263908|1.0|This book was awful. Reading this book is like watching a low budget porno.  It is at times laughably bad and then suddenly slips into \\"what??!! Who talks like this???\\"  50 Shades was at times shocking and certainly graphic, but at least had a decent story line and characters with some depth and believability to go with it.  This is a vulgar copy at best. I would not recommend this to anyone.
B005HSL626|3.0|it took for ever to downlowd a but its a very fun game and the adverting is a little over the top but very slow downloading : * (
1451629184|5.0|Awesome story about her 18 years of captivity.  She is an amazing lady to endure this and get on with her life after she has been found.  It is a quick read and can't put it down. I think I read it in 3 days which I only have time in the late evening after I put my baby down. Very detailed so not for teens of any age.  I would make sure who reads this is a mature adult.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Pretty fantastic little game. Would be five stars if it didn't crash on the fire from time to time. Worth the crash frustration, but only because it is free. Would pay to avoid the freeze on fire
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is well written with a plot that keeps me interested .  im not a reader but saw the movie and wanted to see what the hype was all about.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have tried at least 15 notepad apps. I only like two of them and this is the best. You can organize by color, so you get 9 categories to keep things well organized.  I use this app EVERY day. Great support from company, but you should never have to use support (they was a minor problem with backups, but it is fixed). Options for everything.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Since this movie is derived from a board game, I didn't expect much from it. However, the plot and the quality of the FX were an unexpected surprise and even though the acting in the beginning was somewhat overdone, it really took off during the remaining bulk of the movie and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone who wants an hour or so of escape from the day's worries.<br /><br />I have been hesitant to use Amazon for the longest because I thought it was like Ebay, but after checking out their site, I decided to order something and see how it went - another surprise! The process was really quick and easy and I decided right then to become a \\"Prime\\" member and have not looked back since. I have had nothing but really good service from this Company. My only disappointment is that they don't take Bill Me Later as a payment option.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with Amazon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am not a reader and most books bore me and I never finish them. Simply put, I could NOT put this book down. Best of the series!
B009AJDDQU|3.0|Like my title says, it looks absolutely wonderful. Imagery will take awe you and the tie ins feel more like homages rather than just that, tie ins. Characters are slighted for pacing, example, one characters spiritual faith is glossed over in a flashback but we are lead to believe that it is her driving force in life, even after her faith has scientifically disproven. And she's a scientist! It is the same with the others in the ensemble. And doubly so for the characters who's deaths we only see but never having seen them before that.<br /><br />Not sure how this came to be but it should have been a stronger outing. Maybe he's saving it for the sequel.
B001AU8ZLK|4.0|This album is quite enjoyable to hear. The songs are overall good and a couple of them just pop out of the rest as favorites.
B006O6FK2W|5.0|Dark Knight Rises was awesome! I ordered this toy right after watching the movie. Not sure how fun it is to play with...as I only bought it because it looks cool. But I'm happy with the quality and it's overall look.  THUMBS UP  :)
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I'll be honest, when I first heard that a live-action web-film was in the making, I was a bit skeptical. However, when the official trailer was released I decided to give this project a change.<br />Never have I ever been this glad to be wrong. The movie boasts strong performances from its main actors, Tom Green and Anna Popplewell, who play ambitious cadets with tragic back stories. Never has a web-film seen such quality story telling. With a small budget of $10 million, 343 Studios delivers the movie fans have been begging for. Even if you aren't a fan of Halo, I guarantee you'll be blown away by this mini-masterpiece.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The way this movie was set up by each superhero's individual movie before it was genius! And for amazon's price with free shipping, I'm confused why there are still people out there buying blu rays from best buy! I guess it's true, there's a sucker born every minute!
B0055S348W|5.0|Giving this really neat program a 5 because it works perfect. The only downside is it is a bit slow but functionality trumps speed. Enjoy!
B005OJTVAW|5.0|My Kindle Fire is an easy fit into the tab folio, attractive and offers good protection. I like the pocket inside the cover for extra storage.  I was on a flight recently and received questions and compliments about the folio.  One person commented that they were going to purchase one.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|It  was an interesting book and was a good book after all . I love all the decisions they made. it just really get you thinking about everyone else situation. i will recommend this book for anyone that has lost someone.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Rowling certainly knows how to stimulate thought. I remember being *required* to read various books in high school. This is one that will be passed around surreptitiously  and devoured by high schoolers.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome that is the only word I can say about this book. I loved this book couldn't put it down to save my life.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I never knew what all the craziness was about Angry Birds. It is very addictive and challenging. It is also lots of fun.
B007SGM084|5.0|Every body dreams of a life filled with Love,Romance, ands lasting relationship. These books kept you wanting more and hoping  the author continues this series.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Many others on here have described the book and the unusual recursive narrative it employs so I will simply state my feelings on this book.<br /><br />The author tries to convey the evils of mankind, in particular greed and how the strong control the weak.  As the Dr. Goose character notes, \\"the weak are meat and the strong do eat.\\"  The author wants one to see that this survival of the fittest will be our undoing if we do not control it.<br /><br />Throughout the story the weak are controlled and culled to empower the rich and wealthy.  From South Pacific natives to futuristic Korean clones it appears we are controlled through media, big corporations, and religion.<br /><br />You don't say?<br /><br />Unfortunately there is nothing novel about this book.  Reincarnation, repressive dystopia, 'corporacy is slavery', civilization's downfall from our greed.<br /><br />And there is the rub.  The book is itself a reincarnation of past stories.<br /><br />Why the author even mocks the reader when Cavendish yells during his failed escape that 'Soylent Green is people' only later to see Somni clones being turned into liquid protein for the masses to eat at the Golden Arches.  As if the author is saying 'yes, I am a thief but there is nothing you can do about it. You'll look stupid if you mock me so post a good Amazon review like the other mindless sods'.<br /><br />The author knows he has produced nothing new and his soylent green comments simply rubs it in your face.  The author is his very own Ayrs, taking the works of others and simply 'polishing it up' so to speak.<br /><br />Even more, people will be packing movie studios like the tobacco church of Raiatea to listen and nod and say 'yes the author is right, corporacy is slavery and mind control' all the while actually shelling out money to the likes of Warner Bros to be told this?<br /><br />The Cloud Atlas book and movie are themselves the first and last chapter of the story.  In purchasing this book, I feel like Adamwhen Dr. Goose says, 'Your turn to be eaten, dear Adam.  You were no more gullible than any other of my patrons.'
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Not the best book that I have read, but not the worst by a long shot. There are a number of holes in the plot and parts of the book are a little unbelievable.  However, it is very readable and will hold your attention, provided you can overlook the inaccuracies, because there are some plot twists as well as bad ones.  The cool clean hero kills all of the bad guys (some with quite brutal violence) and then walks away with a clear conscience as he was nice to the good guys.  Pure escapism and overall I found it enjoyable enough..  Not in the same class as Michael Connelly or Jeffrey Deaver, though.
0345803485|1.0|The writing is horrible, but there are some hot scenes, so I mean, people know what they're getting into generally when they're buying erotica.<br /><br />E.L. James is certainly not the next Hemingway, but hey, she has 3 books published and I don't.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|It was a campy and fun film. Of course, I love Johnny Depp and Michele Pfeiffer was great. Fun night's entertainment.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed the writing style... enjoyed the 2 voices unraveling the tangled story events.  Found myself always eager to open my book, to discover what turn could possibly happen next now that I know it's gonna get more complicated!  Not sure I liked the ending... but then I guess I should have seen that coming!  A doggone good read!
B001IF252M|4.0|The Apple Mini DisplayPort (TO VGA) is the best one out there because it is made by Apple itself. If you consider any 3rd-party devices to do the same type of function, please avoid. I also have several 3rd-party ones (due to doing many presentations in a work environment), but they do not always work with all types of VGA connectors, especially when connecting to projectors.<br /><br />In the end, Apple's default offering of this product is best and it works as promised.<br /><br />-AmazonPro Reviews<br />Est.

B004AM5QT4|4.0|This wasn't one of Ken Follets best but it did hold my attention.  Plot was interesting and engrossing.  I would call it a recommended read.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|I have always been a Diana Krall fan, right from her starting days... and appreciated her jazz piano abilities and her singing, but over the years I have noticed a promotion trend that seems to dismiss this aspect of a very talented musician.  Each album seems to be focused more on selling her as a \\"sex symbol\\"  instead of a musician, with \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" completely dismissing her roots in jazz and high quality musicianship.<br /><br />I do realize that performers need to push their comfort zone to grow, but Glad Rag Doll is a disappointment because I feel that she is being \\"handled\\" by promoters that have little respect for her incredible jazz talent, and only want to take the easy advertising route that might appeal to the lowest common denominator audience.  I can only hope that Diana Krall will make her next album with a new producer that appreciates her truly amazing jazz musicianship.
B003CN4R74|5.0|Like another reviewer said, I was unsure about this one at first, other than a couple of tracks (\\"What You Want\\", \\"Lost in Paradise\\").  It sounded more like plenty of noise with (fortunately) Amy Lee's incomparable vocals that will bring me coming back every time to give it yet another listen.  I can only say that after listening to the album a few times, I quickly came to appreciate the fact that this stuff isn't simply noise, it's a multi-layered work of art.  Evanescence still rocks my world.  Highly recommended!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|We had a problem with the movie stream from the start.  Amazon took care of the problem for us and my family thanks them.
1439102813|5.0|An easy read on an uneasy subject.  It helped me to try to understand what my father-in-law was going through.  I could not put it down, I can not wait to read other books by this author.

B006MMX1GU|4.0|This is the fourth CD reissue of LOVE IS, the final album by Eric Burdon & The Animals (aka \\"The New Animals\\" -- they never did work that out before the press or the public) prior to their split -- pretty amazing when one considers that the original 2-LP set never even cracked the top 100 in albums in America, where they'd had most of their success across a nearly two-year run. On the other hand, the record is filled with lots of joys that endure into the twenty-first century, and one is grateful to BGO for putting it back into print.<br /><br />The most obvious of those joys is Andy Summers' (yes, THAT Andy Summers, long before co-founding The Police) legendary four-minute-plus guitar solo on the group's rendition of \\"Coloured Rain\\" -- a solo longer than most singles, and worth hearing, over and over. And their renditions of \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" and the Bee Gees' \\"To Love Somebody\\" apply a valid psychedelic approach to both songs. The other seeming psychedelic meanderings here, such as \\"I'm Dying, Or Am I?\\", present in part as a result of the group's perennial lack of actual, original finished songs, all hold together in retrospect -- the playing and seeming noodling is very tightly focused for its time. If a listener is looking for the Animals of, say, the live late 1963 recording In The Beginning, or their first two EMI albums, they mostly aren't here, but in a way, they are -- Eric Burdon is in such powerful form as a singer throughout this album, that he directly recalls those glory days of the group's origins, even if the musical setting and framing is very different; it isn't that different in some spots, and even the trippy \\"Gemini,\\" an obvious product of 1967/68, features playing that none of the original band members could argue with.<br /><br />It's almost as though, knowing this was probably going to his last recording leading any group of this kind (which it pretty much was), Burdon was determined to make it work, and make it work as both r&b andpsychedelia, even if the content embraced country music (\\"Ring of Fire\\"), proper blues (\\"As The Years Go Passing By,\\" probably the finest track ever cut by the post-1966 Animals, and worth the price of the CD by itself), and pop-rock. What's more, it's a fine showcase for the work of all the others concerned, not just Summers but singer/organist/pianist Zoot Money, guitarist John Wieder, and drummer Barry Jenkins. Even ex-member Vic Briggs gets showcased as an arranger, for his brass charts on \\"Coloured Rain.\\"<br /><br />David Wells' extended annotation on the BGO edition gives one of the better overviews of the later history of the Animals, and the sound ranks at least the equal of the Repertoire reissue of a couple of years back.
1451662432|5.0|I have followed Arnold's life since the Conan movie came out.  I have always admired his drive and sense of humor.  He has been one self made man who has achieved more then most of us will, climbing to the top of three different professions.  Well written.  I hope things work out for his marriage.  Inspirational and educational, enjoy.
B005MHHREI|4.0|This book not only debunks a lot of Mao myths but fills in many gaps in Chinese history...The coverage of the Civil War and it's leaders is outstanding...A must read for all old 'China hands' who think they know it all...
B000000W6X|4.0|For whatever reason I feel compelled to share, after downloading a library copy, how strange it is to hear such a mix of timeless and VERY 1990s-sounding tracks. I imagine it would be impossible to truly mix hip hop and elevator music today. Maybe I can blame what the internet has done to porn.
0767817478|5.0|Great purchase.  Just what we were looking for. My grandson fell in love with this movie the first time he seen it and asked me to buy it for him.  He's only 4.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|I regret every single coin I spent with this book. If there were minus stars, it would be. Cant understand the fuzz about it. Get a sample first. It wont make you think about the money when you delet it.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Mark Russinovich has been an old \\"acquaintance\\" of mine since the SysInternals days. I have always valued his work and in depth knowledge for all things Windows, and I was more than happy to see that he meets expectations as a novelist.<br /><br />After reading Zero Day, I had high hopes for Trojan Horse, and would be happy if it was half as good. To my pleasant surprise, it was even better. With a gripping story line (and unfortunately very close to reality), a computer security buff like myself will find himself not being able to put down the book. Continuing on a well developed story, this time Mark takes it to the next level, offering even more action and even more technical details in the story (not that a security background is a requirement - everything is laid out in simple terms for everyone to understand and enjoy).<br /><br />In all, the book was one of the best I have read (admittedly I am a sucker for everything security), and would recommend to anyone that is even in the slightest interested by the field to read the book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very fun game, my husband loves it. just like coin dozer at the carnivals, the only reason he goes. very happy with this purchase,wish there were more like it.
0316056871|4.0|It was a fun book to read, with details of Tina Fey's life and her road to success and stardom.  It was easy to read, so I read it rather quickly.  I normally take ages to read a book, but I finished it in about 3 days.  I would recommend it, as it has tips on improvisation and dealing with difficulties. Her life story was funny.  It also told me about her other works with other people, so I was more knowledgeable about her work.  A must read for budding comedians.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a wonderful app. It is very precise with how much time and/ or battery life you have left. I use it daily to see when I need to recharge. It's a lifesaver!
0380977788|4.0|Coraline is about a little girl who travels to another plane of existence. It is identical to her own home except much better. It is a world where her \\"other\\" mother and father are more loving and attentive to her and she has everything that she could want. However Coraline feels an underlying sense of evil in the other mother and decide to leave, intending never to return again. However when her parents are kidnapped by the other mother, Coraline must return to the other home to rescue them and make sure they all get out alive. I enjoyed this story. Coraline is a likeable, courageous and resourceful little girl. And even when she goes against advice and what she should do, she does so with bravery. Her habit of doing things when others advise against it is what causes her troubles, however that same quality helps her solve the problem. The only thing I had trouble with were long sentences separated by several commas that had me re-reading them. The story is a little scary for younger readers in that there is a closet-like door Coraline goes through to enter the other world which will remind readers of monsters in their closets. It is an entertaingly creepy story.This was a quick read and I recommend it to ages 8 and older.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Enjoyable time waster for any occasion. Both sides are playable, which adds a fun change of environment. Its worth the download.
1559949902|5.0|I read this book before and saw the movie starring Angjelica Houston. It is a very good story and heart-warming. The witches is about a little boy and his grandmother. When his parents die in a car accident, the little boy goes to live with his grandmother in Norway. From his grandmother, he learns that witches not only exist, but that they detest children and are trying to rid the world of them. His grandmother tells him how to spot a witch. So when the little boy encounters his first witch, he is saved. In his second encounter he is not so lucky. But that is not the end of our little hero. He triumphs over his predicament in a fun and entertaining way. This was a great read...again.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|The book is well written, honest and easy to read, but Locke is far removed from a typical new author. The author behind 'How I Sold 5 Million Books...' had lots of help doing all those things he describes in his book and millions in the bank. To be honest, I wonder how well he would have done with what most new authors deal with which are mainly financial pressures and doing everything DIY. Not to take anything away from the book, it is worth reading. I also suggest you read one of Locke's novels to get an idea as to the writing style he uses; it will give you some perspective on what he is putting out there.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This novel was very predictable. It was basic porno.  I felt like I was watching a cheap porn flick.  It was almost tedious to read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was by far the best book that I've read. I loved it, I couldn't seem to put down the book for even a minute I was completely glued to this book.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love this movie!!!!!  I did not read the books, but I did see the movie and it was wonderful!  It is very intense, but if you can appreciate the movie for what it is, you'll love it!  I have heard great things from others as well!  I cannot wait for the next movie to come out!  I would recommend this to movie lover!
B008J34466|4.0|I thought this was a really well put together compilation by Pink.  It was witty easy to flow and a bit eclectic.  I did find it was missing a bit of that motown funk we got from her with Most Girls but everything urban and pop we've all come to love in her artistry.  All in all this was a cd worth the price and the consideration of a purchase.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was great. it makes you wonder about the thoughts and feelings of your own dog. I definitely recommend it to any dog lover or really just anyone!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Awesome!  Couldn't stop playing!  This can keep you busy for hours!! Great for long drives or waiting in doctor's offices!
B0091REZMW|2.0|I ran out of diamonds, assuming I could get more with my game coins.  Not so!  You have to purchase diamonds (and coins)  with REAL money!!  I cannot afford this game. Too bad, because I found it to be lots of fun otherwise. BEWARE - this game could end up costing you LOTS of money because it is not a one time purchase - you can keep buying more coins and diamonds. Parents should be aware of this if they let their children play this game and it is tied to an Amazon account.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun seek and find style game. quite challenging with day and night searches.  runs good on my kindle fire. thanks for the great app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have plenty of fun playing this game. The variety keeps me occupied for hours. I would like more points per game but all around fun!

B004W1GCNC|5.0|Loved it Even better than Downton Abbey Season 2 very exciting with lots of history and action lots of juicy scandals and costumes and settings are lovely
B008K5T5AI|4.0|Very solid Culture novel. Not quite at the standard of Player of Games or Surface Detail, but right up there with Excession. Banks has been pushing his social commentary a bit more overtly in recent years and thanksfully this steps back from that and while his views are still plainly apparent he isn't slapping you in the face with them. Good book, no hesitation to recommend to fans of his other sci-fi.

B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I am not the type that starts a book only to put it down and not finish it. I almost did that in this case. I am glad that I didn't. My reason for almost putting it down was the style of writing. The author writes in scenes that are small vignettes that at first seem to be very disconnected.<br /><br />The story starts with Maggie, the main character, in France looking for her niece. She is there to meet this Englishman, Robert, who says he knows where the niece is and is willing to help her get the child back. She gets upset since he seems to keep putting her off and offering excuses why it is taking so long to get the child. Finally with the help of Laurent Dervier(?) he returns the child to her. She then leaves France to head home to Atlanta where she leaves the child with her parents.<br /><br />Maggie's sister, Elise, then shows up at her apartment where she explains that she has been trying to get away from her lover Gerard Dubois and that she has been living with Gerard and has been introduced to the life of an addict. Initially Elise had moved to France to study art, but had met Gerard fallen for him and had dropped out of school. Maggie tries to help her get her addiction under control before bringing her to see their parents. While Maggie is out shopping for new clothes for her sister, Elise is murdered. Gerard Dubois also shows up looking for Elise. The police are no help to her since it seems that no one can be placed at the scene of the murder.<br /><br />Laurent Dervier also shows up at Maggie's apartment and ends up moving in, continuing a relationship that they had started in France. He tries to tell her to stay away from Gerard, that he is dangerous. Still looking for answers to the murder of Elise, Maggie travels back to France to contact a woman that her sister had been writing to. Here she finds a lot of answers to some of her questions but not all.<br /><br />There are so many characters, her boss, her sister, Gerard, Laurent, the police, etc. that it is hard to place where they are all involved. Eventually Maggie does put the pieces together and is able to identify the killer of her sister. A very satisfying end to the story to where you see how all these little vignettes all fit in place.<br /><br />I would have given it a 5 star rating had it not been for the initial impact that it gave me with the writer's style. Now that I am aware of it I will be looking forward to the following books in the series.hat it is hard to place where they are all involved.

B00913P6G0|5.0|This album is so real. Kendrick doesn't pretend to be someone who he's not which is really refreshing. You can definitely let this run from front to back without even thinking about skipping a track. *Cliche Alert* Kendrick is a breath of fresh air. This album is definitely complete and chohesive and I will def be going back to listen so some of his earlier joints and checking out some of the cats he roll with.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Others have reviewed the 4-disk release of Prometheus, and have done so more thoroughly than I could. Prometheus is a superb film that integrates very well with the Alien films. It held my attention throughout and left me wanting more.  It is not an action film - but that should not be taken as a criticism. [[ASIN:B0085Z8F4A Prometheus (Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy)]]

B007L6VR6M|3.0|Hmmm.<br />Well, I wasn't \\"swept away\\".<br />Of course, people always disagree on art.<br /><br />I am open minded AND I was a boy scout.  I SURE got in trouble with girls at a young age!<br />Despite all, I found this comedy extremely quirky and most times I could not be especially sure what the director was trying to convey.<br />The scenery was beautiful, and the cast, absolutely first rate.<br /><br />It wasn't supposed to convey reality.  And the violence put my wife off of it.<br />Over dramatizing the scout stuff was clever and funny at times.  But I was still not sure what part of never-never land the director wanted me to reside within.<br /><br />Personally, though I get what other reviewers are saying about recreating the angst, difficulty, and clumsiness of young love, I would not tell anyone that this film is a must-see.
B004SBX112|2.0|Here we go again folks.  First it was waiting 4 months for the Angry Birds Rio update (see below), then it was the update that we're all still waiting for for the original Angry Birds (updated in the Google Play store 10/9/12; going on 2 weeks now), and now a new update is available for Angry Birds Seasons in the Google Play store as of today, 10/24/12. This update adds Halloween haunted house levels, and at this rate we likely won't even get to play them before Halloween.  Amazon users who PAID for the app are left waiting for a third time. These delayed updates have happened with every single app I've purchased from the Amazon App Store, and to call in incredibly frustrating would be an understatement. Prime example: Angry Birds Rio was updated on March 26th in the Play Store; Amazon didn't update theirs until August, a full 4 months later. Unreal.  I'm done purchasing Android Apps through Amazon until this situation is rectified. Be warned people. Amazon, please provide timely updates to your Android apps!

1476715904|5.0|Now anyone who knows me knows I enjoy a good book and I will always try a new author, I did just that and I found that from the book Slammed by Colleen Hoover. It's a 2 book series and I finished them both in a matter of days. I don't normally brag about books but I'll admit that I enjoyed one, But this book was a must read and I will read it again.... It was just all around a great book!
145210655X|5.0|This book is so simple, yet so effective in getting to heart of the Father-Son Relationship.  My son and I have read this together more than any book...ever. Mostly because we can get through the whole book in one sitting, right as my son is going to bed.<br /><br />My son and I both love Star Wars, and we get every inside joke, every nuance, every heart-felt emotion.<br /><br />We would love to see this as a 'Calvin & Hobbes' type collection, where there are more volumes to enjoy.  This one book is not enough. We want more!
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|Honestly I can say I haven't a clue why people love this movie. A few good actors in Roberty Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo, but a big gigantic, forced mess with nowhere to go plotwise. Aliens? Give me a break. The story wasn't there (it's Marvel though) and the characters are flat out boring. I expected more from a superhero fllm with a lot of people in it yet there is the problem. Too many heroes or villians ruins a film and too many boring so called super heroes here and look at what we have-a mess. No true villians, but the guy from Thor (amazingly not a bad movie). I may be spoiled by The Dark Knight Trilogy, which was a work of art and story and with amazing actorrs so anything after that is junk, but I do remember the first 2 Spiderman films and the first X-Men film being quite good. Oh well CGI has taken over and B grade super heroes as well.
B006LSZECO|3.0|..at least for 3/4 of the book; I couldn't put it down. The ending is what ruined it for me, but you be the judge. Definitely worth reading. Suspenseful if nothing else.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was an excellent book! I had heard all the controversy regarding its context but it is so much more than about sex. I will definitely recommend this book. Also look forward to other books from E L James.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|unexpectedly loved this series. The book is very descriptive and allows the reader to easily visualise the scene, however the last chapter when she returns to district 12 i find is summed up quickly and wanted a little more information than what was given. Great read

0316666343|5.0|Susie Salmon's life comes to an abrupt end as she is raped and murdered by her neighbor, Mr. Harvey. Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones reveals the haunting story of a girl who watches over her family from her own heaven. The novel and the reader dive into a situation that may seem harsh or graphic for the average reader, yet at the same time allows for one to become more aware of their surroundings, and opens a door to the discussion of the controversial topic of heaven.<br /><br />As the first chapter continues, the reader discovers how Salmon was murdered, revealed in a detailed scene during which her neighbor rapes and eventually kills her. Despite the difficult and graphic description, I believe Sebold placed this scene at the beginning of the book for a reason, which helps the reader to understand the severity of the situation. Personally, this was the most difficult part to read because the scary thing is that these types of situations of girls being lured actually happen.<br /><br />Also The Lovely Bones opens up on the topic of heaven. While in heaven, Salmon watches over her family to see how they deal with her death, friends, and killer as he gets away with murder. In order for Salmon to leave this place of her own, she must let go of the past she clings on to and finally accept her death. Sebold allows the reader to in envision his or her own opinion through her non-biased way of writing of heaven.<br /><br />I was a freshman in high school when I first read The Lovely Bones. The Lovely Bones is a book that should be read in high school because while it does come across as too graphic, the harsh opening allows for the rest of the book to discuss the severity of these situations and raises awareness as to their prevention; it even provides a new perspective of heaven. Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones is a fantastic read and I highly recommend it for anyone.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is a fun book to read but at the same time, it makes you think that no matter how old you are you can be brave and do new exciting things
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an excellent follow up to Hunger Games.  As with Hunger Games, it's an intriguing look at how adolescents coming of age view and cope with violence and oppression.  While this is written for a juvenile audience, I strongly suggest that parents and guardians of children/adolescents who are reading the book, read the book as well.  My son and I have had many long, serious conversations about war, war atrocities, terrorism, honor, and strategy thanks to this well-written novel.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The best kind of escapism, the author's journey is fascinating, dramatic, and served a serious purpose.  You won't only be reading about a hike in the woods, it's the author's vision quest, and it's a privilege to accompany her on the trail.  Highly recommended.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|\\"The Descendants\\" is in my opinion, George Clooney's finest film. I enjoyed the film, maybe captivated by it. Clooney is not my favorite actor, but I've seen most of his movies since he left TV. And I appreciate his versitility at him owning each character he plays. And this was an example of great acting that, I think, puts him right up there with George C. Scott.
B004TTHLBE|1.0|I rarely feel as though a read is a waste of time, however, this one was a total waste of brain space.<br />A thoroughly boring and laborious process which I continued only for the sake of my OCD tendencies to finish what I had started. I contemplated dropping the book on multiple occasions.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|In the first few minutes of the film, I thought boredom would be my reward for watching to the end. Wrong! Once the characters (all fine performances) started interacting and the plots kicked in, I was hooked. The movie could have been an hour longer, and I'd have stuck to it. Fine acting, excellent editing, and the characters were interesting.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I have enjoyed the entire Highlander series. I am taking my time reading this one, I don't want it to end. To me thats says \\"this is a good story/book!\\". I am reading my copy on my Kindle keyboard, makes it very enjoyable, larger print and lighter, easier on the hands.
B008RV5K4U|4.0|The kids like it. I didn't really appreciate it, but I'm not the target audience. The CG is strictly at comic-book quality, flat images, and wide-jawed heros. I couldn't sit through it, but the kids seem to love it, so I gave it four stars. If it was for adults, it'd be, at most, one star.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|If you are looking for a new game to play with friends or family, then you found it! I am 27, and enjoy this game but I think it's a game for anyone 10+.  The strategy is fun, it's different every time and a fun activity to enjoy with others!<br /><br />It can be hard to get started so don't give up - just play it once and you will be hooked forever!<br /><br />My overall rating is 4.5.  I dropped it .5 because there are so many pieces and wish the board was a little easier to set up/stay together. I spilled water on mine and its even harder to put together now...I might just buy a new one.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|enjoy the jack reacher series. There is a pattern to all of the books that is becoming a bit predictable, in that he almost always works with a female law enforcement officer whom he has sex with. Not hating, just mix it up, jack reacher is a great main character<br />, you have a good thing going here, much like tom clancy's jack ryan.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I haven't been able to put this book down since I downloaded it.  I am almost to the end, and am still in suspense about the attack on the main character.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Loved season 4 of Castle. If you haven't seen it yet I advise you wait 'til price goes down and then get it and enjoy it. Castle is a lovely show.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. It's so addicting you can't put it down. Hours of fun. Great for all ages. If you like the coin games at the fair this is a perfect match.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Johnny Depp! Just not in this movie. His acting is spot on as always however, the story line is to much like that of every other vampire movie out there.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin Dozer is way fun. Be carefully though-it can be crazy addicting! I Absolutely Love it! It's a great way to pass time in a waiting room.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The series is a good, light one for easy reading. I did appreciate the development of a new type of world and evolved society. But I thought the third of the series was least enjoyable. It's a bit stretched out. More game-like more made for movie. The second built enough interest for me to finish the series. But at the end of it I don't think it'll be one that I necessarily remember and recommend. I'll watch the movies though...
B008XG1X18|5.0|works well on my kindle fire. And its free so you cant do better than that. And I have no complaints.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good book. Nicely develops the prequel into unanticipated story line. Better character development than the first book. It helped some of my questions from the first book regarding Panem and the other districts. Its a good book for just light reading about a what if world. Not as intricate and developed as say Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings. The characters are best one dimesional and simple. This series as a whole and specially the second and third books feel more like they were written to be made into movies and video games. More action oriented...I guess.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Anything you might need in an alarm clock app can be found in this, even better in the fact that it's free.
B005LAIGPU|4.0|I had a lot of fun watching this movie. The three kids actually acted their age! Teasing each other, casually misusing their power until they were forced into recognizing that they could hurt others. The growth of their powers and their relationships with each other was just really well portrayed. Andrew and Steve were people that clicked after re-encountering each other in a stressful situation. Steve opening up to Andrew was just really well done.<br /><br />You could totally see the inspiration for Chronicle in the progression of the movie, as it really reminded me of that awe-inspiring anime, Akira. Kids playing with their powers, then using them to become \\"cool\\" and escalating from there!  Fun fun movie!
B00005JLEU|5.0|While no one will ever read this review I'm sure, I wanted to give this 5 stars.  It really is a masterpiece.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I was passing the whole game and then suddenly I had to stop u know had to go eat.... then I get Back to the game and the whole thing is erased like all the stars and levels I got to gone...... I suggest u get it but watch out!
B0000TAZYW|5.0|Although the shipment is later than estimated, it finally arrived on 19.10.12. The sound effect of DVD audio is smooth and clear. It's a pity that production of DVD audio format had been stopped. If someone get a medium price DVD player and does not have this cd, he should buy this dvd audio disc.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Awesome! Just wish cash and energy were earned faster. Wickedly addicting! Works great on my Kindle Fire. Highly suggest this fun game!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Horrible acting, terrible plot, and awful musical arrangements (despite the fact that 80's hair metal rules).  And even the least sensitive will be put off by the misogyny.
B007DIQAS8|4.0|Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded is a lot better than her debut. The songs are better and even though they are more pop and dance than hip-hop and rap, it's still great and fun to listen to. The best songs on the album would have to be \\"I Am Your Leader\\" (featuring Cam'ron and Rick Ross), \\"Beez in the Trap\\" (featuring 2 Chainz), \\"Champion\\" (featuring Nas, Drake and Young Jeezy), \\"Right By My Side\\" (featuring Chris Brown), \\"Starships\\", \\"Pound the Alarm\\", \\"Whip It\\", \\"Automatic\\", \\"Turn Me On\\" and \\"Va Va Voom\\". Can't wait for the re-release Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up on November 19.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game! Reminds me of when I was little and used to play the real game at carnivals and other places.
B004V43ZQC|4.0|Julian Barnes yet again finds a compelling way to taunt my confidences in the \\"facts\\" I am so certain of.  Whether a woodworm on Noah's Ark, a painting of a shipwreck, or a dreamer's dream, he left me thinking that an individual's perspective of an event doesn't shape the story of \\"hard\\" facts but rather that the facts themselves are shaped by the perspective of the individual.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Followed the directions to install, to the letter, but it does not work.  I am uninstalling.  Will use Epsonconnect for my printing!  :(
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Excellent - thoroughly enjoyed it -would recommend it for anyone who likes adventure - keeps you captivated throughout the book until the end.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|the game is fun. passes the time. not overly challenging. could use more dolirections. it was free and I played it on the kindle fire.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|Very good reader when it works but consumes the processor and freezes up about 80% of the time on my Kindle Fire and Droid X. Too bad as there aren't any other readers as nice. If it weren't for that it would easily get 5 stars.
B0039RY3MM|5.0|It arrived very fast. It doesn't make big difference with other compounds when used for general purpose, however, It has no rival for overclocking [Overclock my core i7 960 from 3.20Ghz (stock) to 4.4Ghz] using a Corsair H100 cooler and the temperature is 44-48°C. Totally RECOMMENDED!
B007THA4FI|1.0|What a depressing dreary story. Not one likable character in the whole town. I couldn't wait to get it off my kindle.
B009439HP8|5.0|This album is a culmination of every cool lick, monster riff, funky bridge, chanting lyric, air guitar, neck breaking head banging, teeth gritting, beer drinking, highway speeding that you ever heard crafted into one MAMMOTH KILLING, DRAGON SLAYING...... God damn I'm a little overwhelmed. Just go buy this piece of mystical greatness.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I really enjoy playing Mahjong and this just takes it up a level. The HD features make it much better.
B007SGM084|2.0|I actually read this series against my will to be quite honest. I didn't want to read it but I was so sick of everyone telling me to that I did it anyways. The story itself wasn't horrible, however the actual writing itself was quite horrendous. Someone should get her a thesaurus!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book. It's a quick read. It was upsetting, as a mother, forgetting who her children were...  I liked how it showed that she still had preferences and should have input in her life, even as she forgot so much.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I love the House of Night series. Though throughout the series the jumping around with narrators irritates me a bit and parts are definitely a bit childish, but they are all teenagers so it's understandable. Overall it's a very interesting series and I love the mixture of vampyre and witchcraft.
B0000A1M68|5.0|First, let me mention that I had many hundreds of VHS tapes that I needed to get rid of.<br />I ended up saving about 10 tapes out of hundreds. One of these is The Hitcher.<br /><br />I have believed, especially since the 1980's films and later, that anyone can be an actor, and the craft has really gone downhill, in favor of action movies, with plastic characters, and people who are poor actors.<br /><br />However, in this case, C. Thomas Howell is a Master Actor. The transition he goes through in this film is amazing. They way he changes his face, especially in the restaurant scene when Rutger Hauer is sitting at the table with him, is remarkable, unique, fascinating, etc. I cannot find the right words of praise for the way C. Thomas Howell can change his face to show the emotions and change that his character undergoes. It is one of the great acting moments in the history of film. For a very young actor to do this, must involve a tremendous skill and acting ability.<br /><br />Although Rutger Hauer is superb in his role, Rutger Hauer's character remains the same throughout the film.<br />C. Thomas Howell's character undergoes numerous changes, numerous emotional reactions, etc. He makes it look so realistic, it looks natural, but I am sure that it must have taken a tremendous amount of acting ability, and he really got into the feeling of his character. I wonder how he felt after the film was made. He probably needed a rest from the deep emotional changes that he had to portray.<br /><br />I am very very surprised that in most of the reviews for this movie, that his great acting ability is not mentioned by other reviewers.<br /><br />WHAT AN ACTOR C. THOMAS HOWELL IS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And what made him more outstanding, was his young age in this superb performance.<br /><br />I can't express enough, the great admiration I have for his acting ability and performance in this movie.<br />If it was not for C. Thomas Howell's performance, this movie would nothave come across as excellent as it was.<br />He matched Rutger Hauer's strength of performance, and went way beyond it to shine in this movie.<br /><br />In my opinion, C. Thomas Howell is one of the last of the great actors in the history of acting, because of his performance in this movie.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Sorry to only give this 1 star. I could not get the app to download to my Kindle Fire HD. It showed in the queue on the cloud portion,but nothing worked. I reordered it and still it would not download. Too bad because I was able to load it on another tablet I had tried out and ended up returning. I don't know if it's because it's an andriod app. I had no problems with other andriod apps loading on the Kindle FireHD. Maybe just a bad app.At least it was free, so no money lost.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|pretty good app for being free. be nice to have more coins and not have to wait so long for them to regenerate but its an awesome mindless time waster. im almost done the first puzzle so ive wasted plenty of time playing this game and love it.
B0064MT1U8|5.0|My daughter and I watched this together.  We both enjoyed this romantic fiction about Shakespeare and his play Romeo and Juliet.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|What struck me most about Canada was its ever-building tension and continuing sense of foreboding, written in the voice of one recounting innocence after that innocence has long since been lost.  It is a beautiful story about coming-of-age in the most unusual way.  The characters are flawed and realistic.  I loved every page.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm so glad I came across this novel, because this is the sci-fi I love - dystopian futures, decaying worlds, people living differently, surviving. The underground silo in which the stories are set might be a finite, claustrophobic setting, but it's also a rich one.<br /><br />The Down Deep of mechanics, the Mids, Up Top and The Great Stairwell that connects them comprise worlds within a world. All varying, with different experiences and thus each with a different reality and story to tell. The outside world with it's poisoned sky and toxic air (all viewable in the Up Top by means of giant screens that project the images for all to see) seems to wrap tight around the silo and is a silent, ever-present, ominous oppressor.<br /><br />You start to wonder, like the silo's inhabitants, is it even there? Punishment for wanting out is the threat of `cleaning', banishment to the outside, to clean the camera sensors and then die a quick death on the barren, sickened hills beyond. This kind of setting shows the best and worst of humanity - the sacrifices of some for the greater good, the lust for power that will always drive others.<br /><br />I really loved the world Howey has created here.
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|A friend let me borrow this movie last year, purchased to add to my video collection. Just in time for Halloween!
B008YMHORI|5.0|An inspiring, enjoyable, powerhouse meeting between two award-winning highly-individualistic classical music superstars who consider their initial meeting as fateful, not coincidence. Hélène Grimaud (who is called \\"the earth\\" in their interview), one of the greatest interpretative classical pianists who experiences sound as colors, and star cello virtuoso Sol Gabetta (\\"the air\\"), famed for the nuanced, singing quality of her instrumental interpretations and her highly emotional playing, meld their 'earth and air' talents and personae into a marvelous musical duo. It began in 2011 in a joyful, fateful musical encounter that 'clicked' immediately. In a wide spectrum of musical tastes, they cover the duo compositions of Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Claude Debussy, and Dmitri Shostakovich, and this diverse program works wonderfully and has toured to great success. All performances are excellent and the 'best of the best' begins with the 'storm to calm' of the 'Finale' of Debussy's Sonata for Violoncello and Piano in D Minor; the awesome beauty and virtuosity of the spellbinding 12 minute Shostakovich Allegro non troppo from the Sonata for Violoncello and Piano in D minor, Opus 40; the fiery third movement of Schumann's 'Drei Fantasiestücke' (Three Fantasies), Opus 73 and the overpowering beauty of the familiar 14 minute Allegro non troppo and the 6 minute Allegro-Più presto movements of Brahms Sonata for Piano and Violoncello No 1 in E minor, Opus 38. Awesome Grammy-nominated performances by two great artists who form a dynamic duo of singular musical purpose. My Highest Recommendation! Five BRILLIANT Stars! (13 tracks; Time 73 minutes, 45 seconds. Booklet notes in English, German, and French. This recording won the 2013 ECHO Klassic award as the Chamber Music Recording of the Year in the 19th Century Music (Mixed Ensemble), category.)
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|Great music and a wonderful performance of the theatrical production. I even enjoyed the extras feature with Andrew Lloyd Webber explaining how the story evolved and how they dreamed up the wonderful costumes and amazing sets. I loved Phantom of the Opera and this story picks up ten years later. I thought they did a fantastic job of remaining true to Phantom but adding a new twist to the love story.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Pete Townsend does not hold back in describing the troubled times he has survived.  This is not a happy story about an extremely talented musician and the spoils of being a rock star.  Townseond goes into great detail about how his creation of Tommy came from his very own soul and experiences.  He then goes on to tell how the repercussions of a damaged childhood led to the harm he caused to himself and others with his reckless behavior.<br /><br />And while this review so far may turn some people off, in the end I would highly recommend this read.  Townsend does a great job of going beyond the typical \\"I suffered and then wound up in rehab\\" story.  He fully explains what the experience felt like -- good and bad.  Townsend was not the outwardly reckless celebrity that Keith Moon was, but he was suffering just like Moon.<br /><br />Another great side to this book is Townsend's description of the 60's British rock scene, and where it all came from.  It seems that everyone that came through this era is writing their memoirs now.  However, I can honestly say that this is a must read.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Its a good game lots of cool graphics and enough to play for a long time especially at the free price there is enough free content to keep you playing.
0515141429|1.0|How did this book get so many 5 star ratings?<br /><br />I literally had to stop reading after two pages. The weird telegraphic writing style is VERY painful and distracting.It would be funny if I hadn't paid for it.<br /><br />If you can read above the level of a toddler, I'd recommend staying away from this book. If you don't believe me, download the preview and see for yourself.
6304698690|5.0|When I was young I watched the movie a lot and I had been craving to watch it again now that I am older but who has a VCR anymore.  Anyways, I received the movie the day after I ordered it or maybe two days after I ordered it and the movie was in awsome condition.  Thanks for bring back a childhood memory
0439023491|4.0|This was the second book in the trilogy a great story line Katniss is at her best. All the characters are well chosen and bring excitment to the plot
0374214913|5.0|I'm only 2/3 of the way through this book and I can't put it down.  It's funny, engaging, and spot-on.  The author hits me at home on so many different levels.  SO MUCH FUN!  What on earth is going to happen next???
B009OYTIXS|4.0|So far, \\"Arrow\\" is well-filmed and well-cast, and the actors are holding their own.  Emotionally damaged heroes with deep-seated daddy issues have much more appeal than the suavely swashbuckling ones who have it all figured out, and Stephen Amell strikes an intriguing balance between traumatized playboy and razor-sharp vigilante that just might keep audiences coming back for more.  With its strong-willed leading lady and quirky sidekick waiting in the wings, the show is definitely worth investing in the next episode or three (or five!) to see how things develop.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Although I am not sure I would buy into the author's underlying assertion that the fifteenth-century discovery of a surviving mss. of Lucretius's On the Nature of Things was responsible for \\"modernity\\", this book is an excellent and engaging read, full of the kind of details and allusions that only a life-time of pursuing scholarship of this kind can provide. Incidentally, I read it in Kindle on my iPad, a format which works well with continual reference to the \\"footnotes\\". The only thing that would be better would be to have actual footnotes, but publishers had stupidly given up on them anyway decades ago (as well as quotes in original languages), so in this way too the digital revolution represents an improvement of access to learning, for those who still care.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was great and it really keep on the story. It is an excellent book and I totally recomend it.
B007FZVWFA|5.0|I saw this movie on Christmas night last year, fun movie to watch.  Scared the crap out of my girlfriend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is a very good book, with a lot of tension and passion. I recomend the trilogy because It is excellent.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I don't use it often but when I do use it, it fits all my needs...Definitely recommend this! I havent found anything bad to say about this app..it is a 'plain' calculator
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|The item was received on time and as described. It was packed for shipment in a careful and protective manner. I recommend this vendor.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Want to read everything from this author, she is a genius.  You are constantly challenged to think and can't put the book down.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I gave a four because i did not like the ending.<br />I really liked the suspense.<br />I would recommend this book to all my friends.
006097625X|3.0|I have a working knowledge of Comics, and looked for McCloud's book to not only tell me about comic theory, but also to apply it to specific works.  McCloud is good on the theory, but neglects to tell me much about WHAT comics are out there that are engrossing and illustrate his points.  I didn't walk away from this book, as I had hoped, thinking \\"Wow! I can't wait to buy this and this and this comic!,\\" and that's a shame.  Scott McCloud obviously cares deeply about comics and is knowledgeable; but why does he completely neglect to talk about plot? Or characterization? Or the typical lengh or panel count by page of a comic?<br />In short, this is a decent, readable book by an extremely knowledgeable souce, but it has many holes.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|After watching the story on  60 minutes, I went to their website and watched him play & sing 3 songs.  He sounds like Bob Dylan to me.  I went to Itunes but couldn't find him there so I found him at Amazon.  I certainly recommend this album to anyone that likes Bob Dylan.  Sixto's  music is wonderful.
B000053VAF|5.0|This movie is for those out there comfortable enough with their faith to poke fun at some of the \\"Dogma\\" spoken and written down by various religious personages over the centuries.  Director Kevin Smith and an all star cast leave you laughing over some very interesting quips on Christian faith, particularly Catholicism.  Great watch for anyone looking to laugh about something usually taken seriously, Faith
B008I34YYY|2.0|While it does have a few moments of humour and some pretty good special effects, it's still an absurb flick and plot line.
B004KX5KRQ|5.0|... then this CD is highly recommended. Nick Cave's music is very particular, someone likes it and many others do not like it at all.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|We bought this for a friend (Huge Marilyn fan)....Good movie, great value, worth adding to the movie collection for sure.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|When we remember the music of 2011 this will be one of the important records. Surely in this we've heard (and know) more than one song ...
B0091REZMW|3.0|I usually love hidden object games. this one was fun but I sometimes got bored and just go play a different game.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Best books I've read in a long time.  Same ilk as Robert Jordan and George Martin.  Very cleverly written.  Highly recommended!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great read. I though it was a believeable story line. There was alot of sex but not to much. I can't wait for the next book!!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I must say this really missed the mark in my book - didn't like it at all!! Not worth the monies or the time.
B007K8ILUQ|3.0|\\"Fear and Desire\\" had, for me at least, always been this mythical film until recently (when it was shown on TCM and then issued on DVD/blu-ray).  I ordered up the Blu-ray, to add to my Kubrick collection, and found it to be more interesting from a historical and artist-development perspective on a great filmmaker, than finding it to be a good film I'd watch more than once - he'd make far, far better war pictures with \\"Paths of Glory\\" and \\"Full Metal Jacket\\".  I don't think anyone will mistake this for his best work, but as a seldom seen first feature effort (also included on this disc is a half-hour film he made for a seaman's union), it's essential viewing for any serious Kubrick fan.  There are moments in \\"Fear and Desire\\" that do hint at what was to come from Kubrick (composition of shots, interesting angles, striking images) and when you consider that within the decade, he'd deliver both \\"The Killing\\" and \\"Paths of Glory\\", it's pretty apparent that he developed his own style in relatively short span.  As for the restoration, both films on the disc look good considering their age, especially \\"Fear and Desire\\", compared to some very grainy multi-generation-knocked-down footage I saw in a side-by-side comparison.  It looks about as good as it probably ever will, at this point.  Added reason to watch: A very young Paul Mazursky as an unhinged soldier, kinda hamming it up.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|The Talent Code is crammed with information that is easy to obtain and understand.  I will be using this information in my coaching and teaching.
B009EAO38C|5.0|We love the piano guys and all their music. Very excited that they have a CD.  Purchased as MP3 and we love it.  Looking for something new and great - get this.
B008G33NFC|5.0|Hello this is the best female metal singer in world my opinion its got new tracks and songs from Winter Storm and What Lies Beneath great dvd superb vocals and live show well filmed totally love Tarja more by the minute she is beautiful an a singer you never forget thanks for leaving Nightwish now average with Floor Jansen filling in, you have gotten better and better cant wait new release 2013 must see for all metal fans of female singers this is the best there is out there.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST ACTION MOVIES EVER MADE................. I'VE ONLY SEEN IT ONCE......<br />IT NEEDS TO BE SEEN A SECOND TIME BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TAKE IN ALL WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE IN ONE VIEWING BECAUSE OF THE NONSTOP ACTION......<br />THIS MOVIE IS UNSTOPPABLE...<br /><br />This probably without a doubt my favorite action movie of all time.....
B009CPJHY4|4.0|We enjoyed the DVD of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.  We've enjoyed Judi Dench in many of her roles and wanted to see her in this movie.  We were not disappointed.  One or two of the other characters were annoying, as portrayed, but that was the way the script was written.  It was refreshing to see so many familiar faces in the cast and we enjoyed the way that most of them handled their roles.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|The second book in a series of three. Excellent book with lots of twists and turns!  You won't want to miss out on this book, if you love vampires and action.
1452105111|5.0|Fit perfect with my baby's 1st birthday hungry caterpillar theme.  Made of good card stock and can have many uses later -- recommend!
0439023513|1.0|What a terrible end to a series. There is almost nothing likable about this book, especially the final weird convoluted battle where Katniss' sister dies. I had to re-read that twice just so I could say, huh? The evil empire just folds up shop in this book. There is a war but it just sort of takes care of itself and Katniss' job is PR. It's so strange At one point you have a girl with a bow and arrow taking out bombers. Sure she has explosives on the tips but still...it's just so stupid. And the love triangle...I didn't like Katniss and I couldn't fathom who would love her. Basically it was just who was left at the end.
B004GYY714|5.0|No matter what the genre, artist or even country, you'll find it on Tunein. Your mood and style dictates and they have it available. And you don't have to pay large monthly fee's to enjoy it. But it would be a great investment.<br /><br />Ciji38
0439023521|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy the Hunger Games anywhere near as much as I did. I had trouble getting on board with the first person point of view. I didn't really like the main character. I didn't think that Gale and Katniss' relationship was likely to have been so platonic. In fact I was looking for reasons not to like the book, but low and behold I got caught up in it and ended up enjoying the crap out of it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am so impressed with this author. I had never heard about him before, but so so happy to purchased his wonderful book. What an amazing imagination, to have written these words that captured me from page one. I will be seeking out all his other works which I am sure will be equally amazing. Cant wait to hear about the happenings in the other \\"silos\\". Way to go, Hugh.
0439023491|3.0|I can't say that I agree with most of the reviewers on this book. Not nearly as good as book one. No surprises--I mean you knew she was going back into the games, duh. And now the love themes were even more strained than in book one. Simply put Katniss is not loveable and not someone you're going to risk your life over.
B00932IHGK|5.0|Homeland is just one of the most remarkable shows on TV EVER!  The writing, the cinematic style and the performances are all stellar.  This episode was incredible.

B003JOA0U4|5.0|This my fourth purchase of Adata's said product.  We use them in our business (film/photography) and all my employees have them.  This one is fast, a lot of memory, and all have been very durable.  Makes a great geeky Christmas gift as well.  I won't go back to plastic or ones with losable caps again.  Highly recommended after 3 years of previous use on other versions.
B008NABUU8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun to play.  I only wish that I could compare my bridges to the optimal bridges. It is easy to get drawn into the game and the next thing you know is that 3 hours have passed.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I read for many purposes. I read a lot of non-fiction in an effort to learn or understand a topic and I read fiction for enjoyment. Fiction presents an escape, an adventure, a fantasy, a comedy. I write extensively. It was very difficult to justify finishing a Casual Vacancy. As an avid Potter fan, I have read all the books and greatly enjoyed them. The descriptions, the characters, the plotting, the suspense was great fun. There was nothing of the sort in a Casual Vacancy. I had assumed that JK Rowling, who I greatly respect would write a murder mystery, or an adventure. It never occurred to me that she would write a novel with almost no plot, no adventure, no action, just as a study of a number of people, none of whom I cared about, all of whom were uniformly awful and involve them in a really boring effort to run for a boring office. A number of the characters died or had a misadenture and I didn't feel the least bit sad as they were all uniformly non sympathetic. When someone can write about sex and make it boring, uninteresting, and superfluous, one has really accomplished something. After reading a Casual Vacancy, cover to cover, I wished I hadn't.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I love the ad free versions. it makes the game way more enjoyable, however it seems Amazon is beyond slow to update these some times. The latest update came out about 3 weeks ago and still no update.<br />Overall, great game if you don't mind waiting for the updates for no ads.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I originally wanted to read this book because I always read the book before I see the movie (even though I never end up seeing the movie). So I got kind of annoyed when I had to spend 9.99 to get it for my kindle. I mean I don't even get to have the book in my hand, hold the pages, any of that stuff, so why 9.99??? Anyways, I started reading and immediately thought \\"man this kid is weird\\" and \\"who is he writing these letters to?\\" It didn't really matter because it was fabulous. I think whether you are a freshman in high school, or a freshman in college, life can be confusing and the new place and the people, some new, some old friends that have changed, makes you feel awkward, lonely, and sad. Even though Charlie was hanging out with seniors (who sort of made me nervous in the beginning since I thought they'd just pick on him) it's the authors way of showing how hard it is to find good friends and good people to be with. I felt connected to this book and I loved the way it was written as letters. It was amazing to me to see how much Charlie truly cared for the people he was friends with or related to. There are not many people out there like that and this book reminded me that we need to love unconditionally. It is a great coming of age book and I now feel I need to complete my book list by reading all the books Bill gave him to read. Minus writing the essay. I hope that readers of all ages can take their own message from this book, but I definitely feel like a changed person, since the ending was so unexpectedd!
0545259096|2.0|I was pretty excited when I FINALLY found a copy so that I could finish off this trilogy. However, Forever leaves you hanging worse than the first and second book. The ending of this book is left completely up to the reader's imagination.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!<br />Cures:<br />Cole spends pretty much the entire book trying to figure out a cure, and never actually finds one. We find out that Sam isn't actually cured, as the book implies several times. Then at the ending, we're left with Sam not fully cured, Cole not finding a cure, and Grace taking the same 'cure' that killed Jack but didn't fully work on Sam.<br /><br />Holes:<br />There are so many plot holes that the book kinda felt thrown together. The entire summer is skipped to conclude the book with an ending that holds zero answers.<br /><br />Slow:<br />The book flows incredibly slow. So slow, that it took me almost 2 months to finish it. I couldn't get into it enough like the first two, to just sit and read in one day.<br /><br />So much more could have been done with this book. I even would have been happy with a short chapter about Grace and Sam's lives together years later, whether or not a cure was found. Most of the questions readers had are left unanswered. Problems are left unsorted. Overall, it was a disappointment and I don't believe I'll be giving his author another chance. She's already left me hanging bad enough and I fear that the rest of her books may be a waste of time as well.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Often times the second book in a sequel doesn't compare with the first, but this is definitely not one of those.  The storyline in Sylvia Days book is exceptional and wants you to beg for more.  I became very invested in the characters of Bared to You and Reflected in You that it is torture waiting for the next book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this case when I was about to leave the country because I had my Nikon D40X camera and two lenses.  I also had some other accessories with it and the normal SD card case.  There was so much room in this thing that I could fit several other things in here, also.  I used it to carry my iPAd while I was traveling as well and had no issues.  I took it walking around town in Germany for two days and it was as comfortable at the end of the day as when I put it on.  For anyone looking for a spacious, comfortable bad this is the one for you.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Huge.  I have used it to carry all the accessories for my camera as well as two other point and shoots.<br /> - Lots of pockets and compartments to help organize everything<br /> - The inside holders are all adjustable so that you can move the padded compartments around to fit whatever you need and make room for other things.
B004TI5N38|4.0|John Puller is indeed another Jack Reacher.  That's OK by me, this world can't have too many Reachers.  Coal is a dirty business, so to speak and right there in West Virginia it's filthy.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|In Doctor Who series 4, we say goodbye to the amazingly brilliant story telling of Russell Davies (excluding the David Tennant specials to follow) and his supporting cast for the Doctor. Donna Noble, I must admit, was not tickling my fancy and I abhorred her at first, but she quickly grew on me. It was refreshing to have a companion that didn't want to be romantically involved with the Doctor.<br /> If you're a Whovian like myself, then you can't do without this Series. It is the end of an Era (literally).<br /><br /> Buy it!!!
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Iron Man original movie and this sequel didn't disapoint me at all.  I really enjoy seeing Mickey Rourke in a role again and thought he did a fantastic job.  Can't wait for the third one!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am currently planning two weddings, 1 daughter and 1son. Evernote has been my &quot;go to &quot; on my tablet! Just love it!
B007THA4FI|2.0|Given this author's outstanding success, I assumed this would be a book I would like -- with excitement, intrigue, unusual twists, e.g. I found it anything but. The reader has to keep track of most of the population (so it seemed) of a couple of towns and their complicated relationships to one another. Plus, until near the end of the book, the plot was plodding, boring to the point I wondered if there ever would be any climax. There was, eventually, but not until I'd read 80% of the book. Plus the characters had little so few redeeming graces that I couldn't seem to care much about what happened to them one way or another. I'm just glad I didn't part with the price of the hardcover edition!
0525953728|1.0|Paid for item that was \\"shipped\\" but not received. Be careful, scammers establish a good record at first, then collect payments without fulfilling orders just before busy holidays.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I would classify this as post-apocalyptic, there is no advanced technology or other sci-fi aspect.  A little bit derivative of Galouye's Dark Universe. Pretty good story, some excellent suspense.  Characters are not one-dimensional as I expected them to be.  A simple drawing of the silo would have been an immense help to the reader, the scale of the construct is not as clear as it could be.  Good value for 5 bucks!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The process of ordering the books was seamless and in fact encouraging for future purchases.  I am completely happy with my purchases. In fact, I have stopped reading number three in fear that I am so close to the end of the most 'page turning/click over' novels I have ever read.  I do not wish to end this love affair I am experiencing with the author and her featured actors - Christian and Ana.I see shades of Ana in me and I find her inspiring and enjoy the exhaustive Christian!  Even have my poor husband joining me with the read and he too commented on the wonderful writing style and skills of the author, Madam James.  I need you to continue with your new career in writing, please so I can finish book three in anticipation of four and five.  Let me know who inspires you!  warmest
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Excellent graphics on my Samsung Tab 2 10.1&quot;.  This will be great for when I need to kill some time and I'm too tired to read. Be sure to do the tutorials .  They are short but give essential guidance.  Buy this simulator and have some fun finally.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game on KindleFire was acomplete surprise. How can the game develpers pack such an inticate game into a small package? The graphics are bueatiful, the sounds and music appropriate and thestory line and details are stunning. The puzzles are challenging, at least for a neophyte gamer like myself. The Bigfish gamesite is readily available to assist with the tough stuff withou ruining the mysteries, unless you need tjhe help. The \\"walkthrough\\" is easy to follow if you need hints or explanations. The only real problem with this game on the Fire is putting it down. Thanks Amazon and Bigfish games.<br />Actually I'm just editing to see the Enigmatic 2 preview. I can' t find it anywhere. Give me a clue please. Thanks Jeanie.
B0082JYAZ2|4.0|Regina Spektor's Album \\"What We Saw From The Cheap Seats\\", is a great album. She has a great mix of fun songs and some more serious songs. The only thing bad about this album is that it is too short. :(. If you love Regina you will love this album.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun, exciting and addicting. I really enjoy this game. I can not put it down! I would say download and enjoy!!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I made the mistake of paying for this app before I really tried to use it.  I can't load from the gallery; I can't load from my camera to the Kindle storage; I can't believe I made this mistake!!!!!!!  Larry Turton

B009KHDT0C|3.0|Genre confusion and too much make-up resulted in a mildly entertaining, campy mess that withered away to yawning predictability by the end. Good production values, Johnny Depp and cast saved it from absolute ick-dom.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|best game I ever played. u have to get it.  its free, fun, and you will really enjoy the game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's difficult to describe Wool. Yes, it's science fiction. Yes, it's post-apocalyptic fare. Yes, it's amazingly well written. But it's so much more than that. It's one of those rare instances where the world inside the pages came alive for me. And from what I can gather from the ever growing fan base this story has initiated, I'm not the only one. I can't describe the story in this review. You'll have to read it for yourself to find out how wonderful it is. But I will say this: every single person that I've told to read this has the same reaction I had. It's such a joy to share such a wonderful, original, imaginative story with friends and family and even strangers! Hugh Howey is an incredible talent. His work reminds me of Ray Bradbury's; such detail and depth to his worlds, such vibrant life infused into his characters. I look forward to more from Mr. Howey!
B0015AARJI|1.0|This was not a very good product.  The battery is defective and does not last more than 20 mins before needing to be recharged.  I would not recommend using this vendor!
B006UW4OB8|4.0|I was looking for a program that would saecurely store my passwords and that would syncronize with my Android Tablet. eWallet does the job very nicely although it is a little more expensive, but still affordable. As with any new software there is a learning curve but, when I needed help the tech people were very reponsive via 2 day email and were right on with their replys. Telephone assistance probably would have been a little quicker but, maybe not if you count the hold time. Where eWallet really shines is in syncronization. This was relativley easy to setup and is a breeze to use. Now, when traveling with my tablet, all of my passwords are available. All things considered, I am extremely well pleased with this program.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Waiting for the third in this fantastic series, I loved these books, maybe better than 50 shades of grey :)
0385738773|4.0|I was fairly interested by The Maze Runner concept but a bit disappointed by the execution.<br />The Scorch Trials was just a major downer, all around.<br />But The Death Cure was a satisfying ending to a mediocre trilogy.  Loose ends were tied up, a reasonable amount of major-ish characters were killed off.  Flesh-eating zombies abounded (I am NOT a fan of zombies, by the way).  The \\"good guys\\" found some sort of optimistic resolution to the problems at hand.  Overall, I found this one to be a good, page-turning read that (based on my previous disappointments) exceeded my expectations.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|Slow paced, not as good as garfields diner. I didn't think it was a very engaging game and took three rounds of the game before I deleted it from my tablet. Although if you are looking for a slower paced game this game could be for you. The graphics are decent, but obviously you pay for the bigger named characters.
0385742886|4.0|Okay, most people seem to be unhappy with this prequel because they were hoping Dashner would write about events that occurred immediately leading up to Thomas being dropped in The Glade...  His relationship with Theresa...  His role as a Creator.<br />Instead, Dashner goes waaaay back to the solar flares and the release of the virus.  Gives us the history behind terminology of The Flare and Cranks.  Honestly, I enjoyed it; found it to be a real page-turner.  I actually liked the flashbacks that give us the backstory with Mark and Trinia and Alec and the escape from NY post-solar flare.<br /><br />*spoiler alert*<br /><br />I agree with many of the posts that you cannot analyze anything in this book too deeply, but I wasn't too bothered over it.  Would Mark and Alec (half-starved and beginning to succumb to the virus) be able to fight against dozens of crazies?  Doubt it.  And Trina, who'd worsened to the point of no longer recognizing Mark...suddenly remembers him just as they are to be killed.  For one final hug?  Aw[...] (Yeah, right.)<br /><br />I didn't even mind that the only reference to familiar trilogy characters (Thomas & Theresa) were in the Prologue and Epilogue.  And even those very short chapters did nothing to reveal any new information or motivation.  I mean, didn't we read that same epilogue chapter in one of Thomas's dreams?<br /><br />My only real complaint:  Deedee.  (Side note: Is it Theresa?  Theresa had a scar on her shoulder, mentioned in book 1.  It'd would've been nice if Dashner had expanded on that for us who are slow to catch on and like things spelled out...) Anyway, I guess my complaint isn't totally about Deedee.  It's that throughout this whole book, they're all fighting for survival.  From the solar flare and thugs.  From the virus and crazies.  They finally find purpose and drive to save this immune child, with the hope that she will be the future, the hope of the human race.  And they die in their efforts, thinking they'd saved the chld.  And the book basically ends.  Only we know that Deedee does go on to the people who -- in their misguided efforts -- create The Glade and Maze and kill so many.  And if Deedee IS Theresa, then she ultimately dies a terrible death, too.<br /><br />Well, boo.  What a bummer.<br />So overall, an entertaining read....but a little depressing.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I totally love this album.. I can't stop listening to her songs, it's addictive.. Lana maybe is not a good live singer, I think because she's shy, but her videos, her lyrics, her songs are impressive.. When I'm depressed I listen to this abum, when I'm happy, too.. It's a perfect combination of many emotions!!<br /><br />We were born to die
1594744769|1.0|As a teacher, I try to read some of the new young adult books coming out each year. Many of them are still entertaining and enjoyable, but this one was not. Using the pictures was an interesting idea, but the story around the photos is boring and predictable. The characters are lifeless. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B009D0LBRO|4.0|Rayman Jungle Run is an excellent example of what a mobile game should be: simple and addictive gameplay with wonderful graphics, delivered in bite-sized chunks. It's absolutely incredible how smoothly the game runs with such fantastic animations at decently high speeds. The gameplay consists of Rayman auto-running through a level and you must help him traverse the landscapes by tapping anywhere on the screen to jump, hover, and punch your way to the end. If this sounds simple, that's because it is. It's not too terribly difficult to complete the game's 36 primary levels. However, there is plenty of challenge within collecting all of the game's \\"lums\\", which are small, yellow beings scattered throughout the levels. Get 100% of them in enough levels and you'll unlock the more difficult \\"Dead\\" levels (there are 4 of them), which will take you more than a couple tries to complete.<br /><br />This game does have its flaws though. The game's soundtrack, while catchy and cheerful, becomes repetitive after a while (as there are only 3 primary tracks) and while 40 levels may seem like a lot, many will finish the game quickly. This is made worse by the fact that there are no high scores or leaderboards, which limits replayability.<br /><br />Overall, a very good, albeit slightly flawed debut for Rayman on Android. I will be looking forward to his future adventures on the platform.
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|good experiance, arrived quickly, wish it was HD, but my mistake for not looking closer. nice guys. i love the show so i bought this season, need to fill 20 words here yeah so i like zombies who eat brains
B007OWG3LM|5.0|I really stupidly approached this album with the attitude that I probably wouldn't be blown away due to some of the reviews I had read, and I picked this album up yesterday along with the new GY!BE.  I thought for sure that the God's Pee would eclipse this album.  Wrong.  I'm a drummer, and I didn't even miss the fact that there are barely any drums on this album.  I was driving around on an absolutely gorgeous fall day, and by the time tracks 5 into 6 washed over, I cried.  I felt so joyful that I was hearing this music from this band, and thought of how people I know have said that Sigur Ros is boring.  Those of this persuasion sometimes don't invest the time or have the patience...and this music requires it, as well as a sensitivity to the kind of appreciation of life that is borne out of meditative and melancholic yearnings.  Thank you so much for this album.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Stieg Larsson didn't let me down in the part II trilogy of \\"Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" in his second book \\"Girl Who Played With Fire\\" - I literally could not put down my Kindle, it kept me intrigued, interested and frightened for the characters.  Excellent read, I highly recommend it for everyone! I was sad to see some of the reviews that were not positive.  The book is fiction and so yes, Lisbeth can be superhuman. I regret the author didn't live to produce a fourth book.
B005XN31LY|5.0|Love love LOVE  Once Upon a Time. Buying it from amazon was less than half the price of the DVD season. Only thing is I'm not sure what I can do with them. Can I save them on my computer or do they have to stay on my Smazon account? I would like to be able to save them so I can watch without using Internet if I wanted. Still love the show though.
B000089RVX|2.0|for years, the big record companies and radio stations (all owned, or almost all owned, by Clear Channel)work tirelessly to synthesize and mimic some type of 'scene'. in this case, the 'goth' music scene is what is being copied by some major label radio-friendly wanna be band. do yourself a favor, get the 'real deal' goth music: Christian Death, Bauhaus etc. This is poseur crap music!

B008WCP2PG|1.0|I was curious to see MAGIC MIKE thinking it was a younger and hipper version of THE FULL MONTY. For some reason, I thought the story would delve into the personal lives of these guys who at night are transformed into strippers. Well, the purpose of this movie seems to be to show off Channing Tatum's increibly fit body along with an older but very fit Matthew McConaughey.<br />The story was bland. There was no depth the story or the characters. The strip scenes and dance routines are the major story here and yes, Channing Tatum is incredible on all level. The guy was blessed with good looks and a perfect body and he can dance! He has the moves. This big, muscular guy can out break dance the best of them. Yes, he is incredible but no, this is not what I wanted to see.<br />There is a lot of eye candy for the ladies but I found much of the movie to be embarrassing to watch. I guess it was not what I expected. I was imagining a comedy where guys have secret fantasy lives as strippers. The dances are highly sexually suggestive and took my by surprise.<br />Of course, some people will enjoy the dancing and the strippers. It just wasn't for me and I was taken by surprise.<br />I am surprised that Academy Award-winning director Steven Soderbergh was part of this film. I think of him as doing unusual, quirky and thought provoking films. Hey, maybe that is a way to describe MAGIC MIKE.<br />MAGIC MIKE definitely has a limited audience appeal but no doubt, many people will love a film like this. I just wasn't one of them.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is amazing!  The characters are engaging and complex; the story itself is well told and thoughtfully executed.  This a MUST read series for any fans of dystopia/sci-fi.  This series gave me my dystopia fix without subjecting me to sloppy writing featuring post-apocalyptic angst-ridden teenagers.  Kudos to you Mr. Howey!

1432794426|2.0|I think that the informing is not a solution to your detractors. In every good author, we have to accept the criticism without passing by the informing and worse still by the obtaining of a reward for the best information. Because that it implies Michael and his fans, it shall be intelligent not to contribute to the division of the fans by such actions and not to use Michael's quotations to justify your acts. Therefore, without having to know the content of the critics against you, I have a lot of reluctance to read your book. Your state of mind shocks me quite hurt there.
B001LM1456|5.0|This is easily the underrated gem of the Avengers tie-in movies, and in my humble opinion, the best of the five. Some call it the \\"Black Sheep\\" of the series, but I believe that this is a result of too many people comparing it to Jon Favreau's \\"Iron Man\\" (Also very good), wherein people see it as a failure to capture the same witty energy as Iron Man, rather than a success at doing something different. And in that area, it most certainly succeeds.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk manages to be a fantastic tribute to both the classic Hulk comics and the Bixby TV show, as well as a superb film on it's own. While it has a somewhat dark tone, I wouldn't call it gritty; more atmospheric and mysterious. And indeed, the first fifteen minutes capture this well, along with being a stellar example of visual storytelling. The soundtrack from Craig Armstrong is also very well-placed, alternating between bombastic and powerful for the action scenes, and engrossing and mood-setting for the calmer, more emotional scenes. The action is admittedly limited in scope, but bery visceral and brutal, and since I can't gush enough abotu Armstrong's score, I'll say again that it suits the action very well.<br /><br />I had never heard of Louis Letterier' before this film, and I still haven't seen any of his work since, but he directs this film masterfully, giving the actors just enough room to emote while still keeping the film's story in sight, and also giving us a fantastic sense of scope. The main cast are all very well-placed, with Norton doing a spectacular job portraying both a brilliant scientist and a tortured soul, William Hurt seeming as determined as the Captain-Ahab-type-character he is, without overdoing it, Tim Roth making a convincing villain, and Liv Tyler makes a good love interest, though I wish she had a little more room to act in the film: mostly she just reassures Bruce a lot and yells at her dad. But oh well, she's still damn-well-cast.<br /><br />All-in-all, definatelyworth a watch.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|The whole series is great. This novel takes you through her realisations of the deeper meaning of the games and what she would have to do to survive. Great read.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am a fan of 50 Shades and I was looking for a book (series )  to fill my longing for more...needless  to say a friend told me to read Bared to You--I did...I read it in just 2 Days!! I was/am hooked on the characters and the story!  I was awaiting the arrival of Reflected in You when I discovered the ebook was already released---I purchased a Kindle (which I am absolutely enjoying) and could NOT put this book down!!  The term “Page -Turner“ doesn't even begin how engulfed I was by this story--I had to know what was going to happen next how was it all going to end??  Needless to say, I finished this book within a very short amount of time.  I don't like to give away too much by way of too many details but I will reveal that I was left  wanting more much much more!  I just hate that I will have to wait until next May to continue in the journey of an unbelievable Love/Lust story that will leave the reader pining for a Romance such as this!!!
0345803485|5.0|My first book like this and I have been hooked ever since!! After this series try beautiful disaster, providence trilogy and  the crossfire novels!!!
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|I remember raving about this book to a family member. What struck me most was the way that the world is described with just enough vagueness as to bring wonder back to this genre of the kind I haven't felt since I was a teenager reading fantasy for the first time. Erikson manages to create a new and mysterious world with characters that are both larger than life and yet completely (somehow) believable. You can't help but love every single one.<br />There are several plot lines and a slew of characters, but they all end up essential to the story in a manner that leaves you reacting at the same pace as the characters.<br />Erikson also seems to use themes in his books, which I'm nerdy enough to find (or invent?) Gardens of the Moon speaks to me of random chance destroying the best laid plans.<br />In conclusion, if you don't like this book, you probably also don't like grilled onions and mushrooms...and I don't understand you, but to each his own.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book!  I would highly recommend reading it.  It's edges but has a great story line that you get sucked into
0062127241|4.0|I can honestly say that I was a Townshend fan before I was a Who fan.  I got into Pete Townshend solo music as a middle schooler when I saw videos for \\"Face Dances Pt. II\\" and \\"Silt Skirts\\" back when MTV just started.  \\"All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes\\" is probably one of the most important records from my youth.  I listened to it all throughout middle school on LP and on a tape recorder.  As I went backwards in Pete's solo work to \\"Rough Boys\\" and the Empty Glass record I eventually discovered he was part of a group called the Who and then I got into their music.  \\"White City\\" was also one of the most important records I had growing up as a teen.  As much as I loved the Who, as a kid I enjoyed Pete's solo work more.<br /><br />Eventually as I grew older, and as much as I enjoyed the Iron Man CD in high school and Psychoderlic in College, I finally made the transition to being an all out Who fan vs. just a Townshend solo fan.  Today in 2012, I can proudly say I have seen the Who 6 times in concert and Townshend's amazing solo show at Jones beach.  Musically today I have moved on to groups like Mumford and Sons, Avett Brothers, Lumineers, and my favorite Del Amitri, but every once and a while I always go back the WHO.<br /><br />I waited for this memoir for a the longest time.  Personally I found it very well written and extremely honest and self-critical to the point of almost being brutally critical.  I have read through the book twice now and was glued to almost every page.<br /><br />With that said, I really would have liked more on the music.  Maybe its cliche for rock books, but Townshend has written some of the best rock songs of all time and yet the book does not really go into detail on many of these great songs.  Also, he hardly talks about some of his really great solo songs.  Also, as much as I like Pete Townshend, I just don't buy the whole he was interested in the connection between banks and child pornography sites, his explanation just does notmake sense.<br /><br />This book was really interesting, but it just did not answer all the questions and things I have wondered about Pete and the Who.
1594745692|5.0|This deck is unique, fun, and the artwork is amazing.<br />I enjoy the vintage-ness of the cards; the Bob Dobbs, Leave it to Beaver, atomic, 50's imagery.<br />The packaging is very cool, and the zombie card instruction manual is neat as well. The information given in it is very informative, and better then most instructions included in the standard tarot decks, and even better then the info in some books I've seen on the subject.<br />I was pleasantly surprised to see that  the images fit fairly true to the basic pictures in the traditional cards, and are in fact very usable.<br /><br />It's the deck of choice for me at the moment.<br /><br />Awesome!

1475143389|5.0|For a while, I was doing bodyweight workouts and just winging my diet.  After reading this book, I learned everything I needed to know about achieving maximum, stunning results with my body!<br /><br />This book went into superb detail about the various factors of the diet that really matter when it comes to losing weight, gaining muscle and maintaining overall good health.  Matthews defines the nutrient types and clearly deciphers the functions of each of them while dispelling myths the fad diets have perpetuated over the decades (ie fats are evil, carbs are evil).  He outlines easy-to-follow strategies concerning calorie and nutrient intake for weight loss as well as for muscle gain when you want to build via weight training.  His information matches what I have found in reputable body building forums and has worked for me personally in the weight loss phase, and I just recently started the bulking phase.  He also gives you some suggestions for what to eat and includes some good recipes.<br /><br />In addition to the dieting portion of the book, Matthews provides a complete breakdown of how to begin weight training, from how many sets and reps to do to maximize the effectiveness of a workout to how to properly rest and allow muscle to build.  He gives his beginner routine, a 5 day split muscle group routine, and breaks it down into a 4 or 3 day routine as well for those of us who are pressed for gym time.  While I have only been at it for little over a week, I noticed on my second round of each workout that my weights are already increasing dramatically.  If you are like me, then weight training can be a daunting experience at first with all the exercises you can possibly do, but Matthews turns this into an easily understandable program that gets results.  It's alot simpler than one would think, and he makes you realize this fact.  As a nice bonus, he even includes a downloadable guide that extends past the beginner's phase of training to help you continue to maximize your workouts and gains, as well as providing many more recipes and some diet and supplement information.  Oh, and it is very refreshing that he does not push supplements much beyond the basics that everyone who lifts should have (whey protein and creatine monohydrate).<br /><br />For someone coming from bodyweight workouts (and nothing at all before that 6 months of exercise), this book gave me everything I needed to hit the gym effectively and establish a diet tailored to my goals that absolutely works.  Even better, Matthews cares about your progress and will stay in contact with you to assist with any questions you have.  I have personally contacted him regarding some specific things and he has gone above and beyond to help me in every way that he can, successfully.  Would I recommend this book?  Without a second thought.  I think this should be a staple of every weight trainer's arsenal to reach his/her maximum potential!<br /><br />Mike
B008NABUU8|5.0|Great family fun as they hang over my shoulder telling me how to build bridges. Very challenging and fun. Ha ha
0061353248|4.0|I'm fascinated by human nature and what makes us tick. I guess, more so, because of what I've been through as a drug addict. I've pulled some really, ridiculous, dangerous, and, OK, stupid stunts. I knew the consequences, I just chose to ignore them. My addiction had brought me to the point where instant gratification was more important than, well, everything.<br /><br />  I really want to understand how I fooled myself, or how the drugs fooled me. And I was under the assumption that if I removed the drugs, I would return to a completely rational human being. Boy, I was wrong about that, on many different levels. I still seem to make a lot of irrational decisions, decisions that don't benefit me in the long run. For one thing, I procrastinate a lot. I also make a lot of decisions based on what people will think of me rather what's best for me. After reading \\"Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions\\" by Dan Ariely, I found out that I'm not alone. Ariely, a professor of psychology at Duke University, performed many experiments that prove that we consistently make choices and decisions that are against our best interests.<br /><br />  As with the last book I read by Ariely, \\"Predictably Irrational\\" has a lot of humorous anecdotes and plenty of insightful wisdom. I understand now that I make too many choices based on how I feel rather than what I know, and that, according to the results of his experiments, \\"Even the most brilliant and rational person, in the heat of passion, seems to be absolutely and completely divorced from the person he thought he was.\\"<br /><br />Written by David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"
B0097EWK3A|5.0|outstanding game. not really realistic but a great game to pass the time.<br />really fun don't know what else to say from here
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I'm a big Christopher Nolan fan and an even bigger Batman fan. I loved the first two movies in this series, but The Dark Knight Rises just didn't live up to the expectations I had for it. Everything that was in this movie felt like it was destined to be a great follow up: Gary Oldman was phenomenal as Commissioner Gordon, Anne Hathaway was really surprising as Catwoman, I thought Bane was well portrayed, the acting and directing was all around very well done.<br /><br />The story and plot structure was completely another matter. There was just so much in this movie that didn't feel like it fit in a Batman story. There were a lot of plot holes, and it just felt very disjointed and made no sense at times. Also, I had problems with all the new characters they introduced and how they seemed to be taking this film over from Bruce Wayne/Batman. This should really be about him, but I felt like Joseph Gordon-Levitt was getting all the attention. I reeeeeaaaally feel like his character was completely unnecessary in this movie. I really wanted to like this film, but it was very long and dragged at several points and I had to look at my watch more than once to try to figure out if it was going to be over soon. Very disappointing end to a great series of films.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I have read this book cover to cover at least 3 times since buying it. Im currently becoming a personal trainer, I have 10 months left in my degree. Nutrition was one thing that I have had the biggest problem with. Not understanding it, how it works whats a good carb whats a bad one. Why body does this, why body needs that. This book explains it all. Then puts it in laments terms to make it easy to understand and relate to. Ive been on the \\"paleo diet\\" for about 3 weeks now and loving every minute of it. Everything in this book is true from my own personal experience! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!

B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent!  Couldn't put it down. Well written and engaging. Character development excellent. Collins has written a sequel that equals the original book. Oftentimes the sequel is disappointing. Not this one. Holds your interest until the final word.

B008YZXYY2|5.0|It almost seems unfair to review this album on its own since, to me, it clearly feels like the beginning of something bigger. Ive never listened to a two-part album where they actually felt like they require their counterpart. For those unaware this is also a concept album telling the story of a man at a crossroads and has to decide to run back to adolescence or move toward adulthood. I have never been a fan of concept albums since every one I have listened to either feels repetitive as it tries to maintain a theme throughout or the vocals become a cross between reading from a book and opera. That being said...THIS IS HOW YOU DO A CONCEPT ALBUM! Corey manages to tell his story while varying the style, theme, and pacing throughout. For those that were underwhelmed by Audio Secrecy (my favorite album of 2010) due to the slower less brutal direction this album should be a nice return to form for you. There are some slower breakdowns in a few spots but the majority of the album is classic hard-hitting Stone Sour. Corey, as always, puts his all into this album. His writing and vocals are phenomenal and continue to show growth and expansion. Jim Root and Josh Rand are the most underrated guitar duo of this generation. Their playing is some of the most unique and complimentary guitar duality in the industry and HoGaB is a fine example of this. Roy Moyerga's playing is top notch once again. His drums really drive and compiment the heavy guitars throughout the album.<br /><br />Gone Sovereign: The album opener and first single is a complete explosion and great way to begin the journey of this story. The guitars have somewhat of an 80's quality to them which is something different for Stone Sour.<br /><br />Absolute Zero: Gone Sovereign's counterpart is a heavy hitter with a great chorus. The heavy riff that drives the song is one of Jim and Josh's best.<br /><br />A Rumor of Skin: This song could easily fit with Stone Sour's first album. Jim and Josh really display their collaboration on this song.<br /><br />The Travelers Pt.1: A nice cooldown from the first three songs. The background music is what stands out for me on this one. Corey and his acoustic take the forefront while string instruments and some light guitar fills add alot of depth.<br /><br />Tired: My favorite song of the album! Again Jim and Josh really shine on this one. The guitar solos are among my favorite in Stone Sour's catalog. Corey's vocals really take control in this song while the lyrics have a very cool feeling of the story's main character speaking first-person to the listener.<br /><br />RU486: The heaviest song on the album. It has a very classic Anthrax feel to it. To me this song has a very subliminal quality to it. The intro, lyrics, and layering of the chorus give a sense that the story's character or even the audience is being \\"activated\\" in likeness of something similar to Manchurian Candidate.<br /><br />My Name is Allen: This song is kind of a mix of all of Corey and Jim's styles. Theres moments of classic Stone Sour, moments of newer Audio Secrecy Stone Sour, and even moments of Slipknot when Corey has sections of just speaking in a dark voice. I like this song but the chorus does feel a little ackward to me for some reason.<br /><br />Taciturn: My 2nd favorite on the album. This song is similar to Imperfect (one of my favorite SS songs) from Audio Secrecy as the main two components are Corey's voice and an acousic guitar. It is very simplistic and yet completely satisfying. The chorus really displays Corey's vocal range. My only criticism, which admittedly is nit-picking, is I really would've preferred the song without the heavy guitar driven 3rd act. Perhaps thats my love for Imperfect's skeletal style speaking. That being said this song has one of the best and most unique guitar solos on the album.<br /><br />Influence of a Drowsy God: This song gives the sense that you are building a conclusion...or I guess it would technically be an intermission in this album's case. The bridge and guitar solo are the prominent parts for me in this song. Not to give the impression that I dislike the song but it is probably my least favorite on the album. I do enjoy the song and have yet to skip it while listening to the album but it doesnt have many standout moments to me so far.<br /><br />The Travelers Pt.2: A louder and more guitar driven version of Pt.1. I like the way the two halves of this song compare and differ from each other, giving the sense that the character is struggling more with his internal conflict.<br /><br />Last of the Real: The most intense song on the album. Corey's vocals are very in-your-face and intense and yet it has a nice hook to the chorus that will keep you coming back. Where most albums tend to save a more mellow or cooled down song to leave the listener walking away on...not the case here. The album closes with a feeling similar to a great tv cliffhanger...leaving you on the edge of your seat wanting more. Luckily we only have a few months to wait until Stone Sour gives us our conclusion.<br /><br />Stone Sour is my favorite band so I may be biased but this album gives me alot of hope that, paired with the concluding half, House of Gold and Bones Part 1 will be a groundbreaking career-defining album for Stone Sour. Putting the music aside for a second, the design of the album packaging that allows the two albums to interlock and create an actual house is pure genius!
B007THA4FI|5.0|The characters are so well developed I felt at times I was in the same room with them.  They were the last thing I thought about as I fell asleep and couldn't wait for morning to continue reading this wonderfully well written book.  The prose and poetry are beautiful.

B008IJT0CE|3.0|I gave it three stars because I was hoping that upgrading from free would have a wider selection of sounds but it's a good app to fall asleep or meditate to. I like to take my Kindle into the bathroom and play one of my mixes while relaxing in the tub, it makes me feel like I'm in a spa. Mixing different sounds together is fun for a more personal sound like rainy days, camping out or kids playing in the sprinkler. I would recommend this app but I am a little disappointed in the sound variety.
B009ANAQ4S|4.0|Very good CD with a jazz back drop. If you like Van Morrison, you will enjoy this CD. Van Morrison sings and plays sax on the CD.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book definately held my interest throughout.  I was a bit disappointed in the ending, but as I think about it I don't think it could have ended in a better way!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so addictive...I won't play this at the fair cause I spend too much money lol...so love this app thank you
B008I34ZFW|2.0|The reviews stated that this movie was a \\"B\\" movie and they were correct. The movie plot was ok but the scenes were not realistic especially on the dark side of the moon. How do you drive a normal 1945 automobile on the moon?
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Book #2 is great, and leaves you wanting more. Its a great mix of erotic literature but it doesn't overpower the story of the characters behind it.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|OK!  I confess I bought it for the stripper scenes.<br /><br />But the back story was pretty good and the acting wasn't bad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Its an amazing book because it has a lot of feeling involve in the story, it makes me happy and sad at the same time and I cant wait for the next.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|This app is very frustrating as it is constantly freezing up.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled in attempt to fix problem. I just removed it as I am tired of the hassle. Love to play Mahjong and bought s different app.  FIX IT.

B005OOSPZO|5.0|I watched this film years ago and I remember many of the scenes but the picture and audio quality this time around are no match.  Superb!  Especially for a film over 40 years old.  Fantastic seller as well.
0812992792|5.0|This novel was so involving I was actually afraid to see it end; there is such a sense of foreboding from the first sentence that I didn't want to know the fate of the protagonists.  Johnson's main character,  Jun Do, is heroic and human at the same time, but the setting--Pyongyang, the camps, the North Korean coast--serves as an equally compelling character.  North Korea, as rendered by Johnson, is a sinister, baffling, mournful place.  The structure of the novel adds to this mystery with its shifting perspectives and voices.  On top of this, the book is fast-paced, thrilling, economically and beautifully written.  Glad I stumbled upon this.
B009UQC7NS|4.0|I did not feel so much excitement in this episode I will rate it a 4 . abc def ghi jkl mno
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Judi Dench is my all-time favorite actress and English films are always superior to American-made one.  This one is no exception.  I have to drive 65 miles one-way to see a good movie like this one, so I am getting the DVD for all my friends for Christmas.....  Am disappointed in Amazon.com because the price of the DVD has gone up since I bought the first three copies.  That's not good.  If you could sell it for $5 less the first time you offered it, you should have stuck to that price.  Now I won't buy as many.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The best thing about this set was the price.  Pre ordered from amazon, the original price was 29 dollars.  The final price by the date of release was 19 dollars, which was cheaper than the original blu ray only price.  Amazon is the real 5 star here, but the movie is awesome!
B0012HRJEA|5.0|This movie is a take on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, set in a modern day, Santa Monica-type Verona.  The classic speech and pentameter remain intact, which can be a turnoff to some, but I thought it was fantastic.  The conversion to modern times is done in such a raw, artful way, filled with thoughtful details.  Claire Daines and Leonardo DiCaprio are in their 90's hayday and shine in this film.  And it has an incredible soundtrack, which I have purchased separately - twice.  One of my favorite films ever.
B007STXHTM|5.0|I've used this housing on numerous ocean and fresh water spring dives. This works fantastic. The quality is crystal clear and anyone with a GoPro needs to have this even if you don't dive. This should of been the standard housing that shipped with the GoPro because it's good for anything that involves water.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The image of the movie goes bad! It kept buffing an loading when it wasnt HD. I had no choice but to watch it!

B008NABUU8|5.0|This app has been a lot of fun to play. I have no complaints about it. It is great great great.
0385495323|5.0|This book starts slowly but gets better and better as it goes along. Very complicated subjects are presented clearly. I finally know what the RSA conferences are about here in Silicon Valley (and I finally know what RSA means). The RSA algorithm is neat and I am determined to hack it (fat chance). Gotta be a way...And now I understand great uses for the modulus. Yep, this was a book that held my attention all the way and I am definitely not a math freak.<br /><br />Only nit was when the author used \\"prizes\\" instead of \\"pries\\".<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
0061801313|5.0|i started watching pretty little liars on netflix and about halfway through the first season realized the story was originally a book series. i immediately added them all to my wishlist and couldn't wait to start reading the first book. while i was a little surprised at some of the things the girls do in the show (especially because it is on abc family) it is really nothing compared to the book - they definitely toned it down for tv. however, this is what makes them both great because you can watch the show and read the books without feeling as though they are exactly the same. i feel as though i know the characters after seeing them on tv so as i read about them i can really picture everything. the story is geared toward teens but i am 28 and i love them. some parts are a little immature, but again, this is the age group they are geared toward and the story is good enough that it is easy to overlook such parts. after talking about some of the crazy situations these girls face my mom is also going to start reading the books. also, because of the issues the girls deal with in this series i do think that if you have young girls that are reading this series, watching it on tv, or wanting to do either, it is important to have open lines of communication about any questions they might have. i would never discourage my kids from reading but it is also important to know what they are reading and how they are understanding or interpreting all the information. these books could even be a great segue to get that communication flowing! i think these books are great - they have it all! sex, romance, crime, drama, suspense, and plenty of mystery.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|After the overly weighty, frankly no-fun Dark Knight Rises, it's a true joy to see a movie that embraces all the fun, humor, and adrenaline-pumping action that great comic book story lines are made of. Joss Whedon really knocked it out of the park here, and Mark Ruffalo is a fantastic Dr. Banner. Can't wait for the next one!

B009F879HK|5.0|As I haven't and probably won't listen to this, I can only say as a collectible piece, it's nice. The sleeve is a light cardboard/heavy paper so it will probably last longer than the actual original in 50 years. Nicely reproduced to evoke the original, but different enough that owners of the original can't be upset they \\"duplicated\\" anything. At this price, you almost can't not buy it.
B005LAII9Y|4.0|Tim Burton's original short was nothing special, it was Frankenstein with a dog from start to finish and was campy but not very charming or funny. So I didn't get too excited about him remaking it. However his stop motion longer remake is everything that the original wasn't. The film is charming, funny and clever, while not just simply being Frankenstein with a dog. Frankenweenie is one of Burton's best!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Having set myself up to watch this by watching all the prequels, I really didn't think it would live up to all the hype prior to its release.  However, it surpassed all the publicity buildup and proved to be a pure delight!
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I could barely put this down...it is very well written, sometimes disturbing but so very honest.  I'm sure this was, at times, not easy for Mr. Townshend to put on paper--brutally honest and at times very sad; but that being said, it is an absolutely mesmerizing read and being a long time Who fan, it was fascinating to read how my favorite songs/albums were created.  Even if you are not much of a Who fan (but how could you not be!), you will find this memoir worth your while.  I highly recommend it....
1439199388|5.0|As a health-care consumer, I think it's essential to keep up with current trends in medical research. We can no longer expect our primary-care physician to know all of the new theories and studies. This book is a fascinating in-depth review of current research and theories on autoimmune illnesses. If any of my friends or loved ones have problems with these illnesses, I want to be able to tell them about current ideas and things to try. I borrowed this from the library first, but when I saw how important it was, had to buy my own copy to dog-ear, highlight, tag and place in an honored place on my bookcase for future reference. Received it 22 hours after ordering, AP is amazing!
1469984202|5.0|Just buy this Omnibus.  After you read the first one, you will have to come back and buy this Omnibus.  However, if you decide to just buy book 1, you will never regret spending that 99 cents.<br />\\"Wool\\" is classified as a science fiction story, a dystopian tale set in the not-so-distant future about the remnants of humanity surviving underground.  It does have a lot of science, and it is dystopian, and it hasn't happened yet, but none of these is where the real heart of \\"Wool\\" lies.<br />\\"Wool\\" is a human story.  It's a story of people and how they live their lives.  In their encounters with ethical dilemmas and questioning what is true, you will see yourself and your loved ones (and sometimes your enemies).  These are vivid people facing difficult, realistic choices about how to best respond to life with incomplete information.  It's a struggle we all face.  One beauty of Howey's tale is that there is no black and white.  Everyone is human, and even the characters we like less we can at least understand.<br />In addition to tapping into the depths of what makes us human, Howey is a master at both pacing and evoking imagery.  You race forward from scene to scene, each tableau perfectly described.  You get exactly the information you need at exactly the right time to keep you \\"oohing\\" and \\"aahing\\" on the edge of your seat.<br />And then there's the prose.  Howey has a simple, fluid, narrative based writing style.  Without complex structure or vocabulary (which some authors use beautifully, ie, Crowley, and others to disastrous effect), Howey simply tells the story as it has always been meant to be told.  The last two pages of book one are a spectacular example of simple but extremely effective writing.  And the gentleness with which he treats his main characters in book two is heart warming.  And the drama of book five is all it was meant to be.<br /><br />Simply put, Wool is and will be proven to be a science fiction standard.  Howey will and should be mentioned alongside Heinlein, Asimov and Herbert for making a revolutionary contribution to the genre.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is one of the best action hero movies I've seen in a while.  It is definitely action packed, the comedy is remarkable and who wouldn't want to spend a couple of hours just looking at Chris Hemsworth?!!  A great movie.  I would recommend it for anyone.
0316227706|5.0|I LOVE this book! I've probably looked through at least 10 times in two days.  Seth is an AMAZING photographer - very creative and the dogs are so funny looking under the water!  Highly recommended - would make a great gift for the holidays!!
B009CPES4I|4.0|I ordered this movie because it sounded like a light-hearted movie and a good way to spend a quiet afternoon alone with a good glass of wine.  I was right.  The movie is comical and true to life in many ways.  You will run through the gamut of emotions.  It is interesting how the universe tends to put us on the path we are destined to be on with the correct people in our lives to facilitate our happiness.  And who wouldn't want a \\"Sonny\\" in their lives?  Always so happy and true to himself.  If you've ever thought about how your older years will play out and just how an unplanned set of circumstances can turn your life upside down on a dime, I encourage you to watch it.  It is funny, thought provoking and an all around happy movie.

1451696191|5.0|When I first heard of The Perks of Being a Wallflower no one could really explain to me what it was about but that it was a very interesting book that I could connect with, being a high school teenager.  For a while I just didn't really want to read it because sometimes I have trouble reading certain books and no one could give a clear description of this mystery book.  Then a couple of months later I saw a commercial for Perks, as a lot of people refer to it, as a new movie coming out soon.  I for one love movies and the commercial kind of gave me an idea of what it was about.  Then the next day I asked my friend if I could borrow her copy of Perks so I could read the book before I went to see te movie.<br />As I read I noticed that I really liked the way the author had written the book as a bunch of letters from the point of view of the main character so you could really tell how much the character had been through.  I liked how he had written the book in a previous time period of about twenty years in the past because I was born just a bit after then and have always been interested in looking at how much the world has changed since then.<br />Perks is not for everyone though because it does get a little vulgar in parts and I know that I don't like too much of that.  Also one key thing that I like in books that showed up a lot in this one is that every now and then the main character Charlie would have flashbacks from when he was a little boy of his aunt, who he was very close to, and how much he missed her after she was killed on his birthday in a car accident.<br />I would be very glad to read more of this author books and see more of his movies in the future.  I recommend this book to many high school students and young adults who enjoy comedy, drama, and vulgar.  Also the book itself is pretty short and just draws you in the entire time so you never can put it down.  In the book Charlie the main character makes many mix tapes for his friends and tells the playlist of the songs on the tape and they songs that I have heard before and it also helped me explore other music form that time period.
B000NPXMTS|5.0|This book sets the records straight about who the gods were and who the gods are today. Jesus Christ?....Bull$h!t! This book is a must read!!! This book is a blessing to be still in print. This is information that really isnt allowed in this world.
0307730697|5.0|An enjoyable book describing the life of a Navy Seal. Truthful-- but I don't believe someone who has a history of drug abuse should be allowed in such a sensitive/dangerous position as a Navy Seal. A testament to a strong will for him to succeed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read this being  the 3rd in the series. I can't believe that this guy can get so much sex. It is definitely fiction. If it is non fiction where can I find a woman like this ?
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have pretty much gone through the entire canon of modern epic fantasy - Tolken, Williams, Jordan, Eddings, Brooks, Goodkind, Martin - and as I despaired that no one will come to take the place of these old masters, I discovered this book. As everyone else said - what a find!  It could use a good editing, especially in the comma-use department, and at times I saw elements that resembled Goodkind's and Martin's worlds, but overall this is a worthy addition to the pantheon. I am thrilled that there are fantastic (pardon the pun) fantasy books on the market like this one and like Ashes of Heroes by Gabriel Archer and Jack Canaan. With writers like these, there is a new hope.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It's not horrible, but at the same time it makes you wonder how it is really a game. Why would anyone spend real money to buy coins? If I understood that part of it, then the whole deal would make sense. I'm being sarcastic, as there is no logic behind spending real money on it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I originally saw Wool as a suggested book in my Entertainment Weekly. As a recovering book-aholic, I was not only apprehensive of picking a new novel up (poor kids, they never see it coming!) but also of reading it on a tablet. I've attempted E-books before, but would never finish them. Kudos to Hugh for finally giving me a reason to kill my tablet's battery on more than one occasion!<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that the Omnibus edition contains all 5 of the original Wool stories in one. The story is fast moving, and you cannot seem to turn the \\"pages\\" (tablet, remember) fast enough. The further into the story you get, the faster you want to read. It's a completely original concept, and left me a hardcore Howey fan. I look forward to reading his books for years to come.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|Quite a scary, although a bit demented series. Sorry I missed the first season on F/X . Sometimes it is a little hard to follow as it focuses on the past and current residents of a wonderful old home. It does jump back a lot and you really have to pay close attention to realize which residents are alive and which are haunting them! Jessica Lange is fantastic and makes the show one of the best I've seen in quite a while. The whole cast really gels to make the program believable.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I have spent as much time with this game as I did when I first discovered Angry Birds. You will not be disappointed. A must-have/play!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is unbelievably awesome -- from the opening page to the epilogue, I could not put it down.  I stayed up until 2 or 3 in the morning, read during work the next day, and still I could not get enough of this story.  Hugh Howey is the MASTER, and it's just amazing that he's not more widely published before now, but I am looking forward to reading the rest of his works here.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor -- buy this one and then when the movie comes out and is a smash it, you can brag to all of your friends how you read this book back when it was only on Kindle!!
1455121924|5.0|So far, lost 37# in 4 months just eliminating wheat.  OK, cheat every once in a while but basically follow the NO WHEAT and pretty much eat anything other then wheat that I want.  Found that after a week, just not hungry as in the past.  More energy.  Sleeping much better and the loss of two pant sizes already is very good and from a size 52 sport coat to a comfortable 46 is a great feeling too.  Have friends and relatives on it now too and all doing very well.  Not a diet. A way of life.  Wheat is the culprit.  That bowl of enriched morning cereal is killing you.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World was a pure delight to read. After Fall of Giants, I couldnt wait to get my hands on the second part of the Century Trilogy. WotWorld added to everything from the first book in the series and then added so much more. A thrilling journey. I highly recommend this book to all.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|This item is completely useless. My kindle cannot load to computer because of error in driver software and I cannot find other driver software for my kindle fire so this cord was a waste of money
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not put this book down - just like the first book, it keeps you interested from Chapter 1 until the end - which by the way - I did NOT see coming!!  Can't wait for Book 3!!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Loved this newest novel! Couldn't stop reading!! Tried to figure out the end but was not successful. Waiting on the next one.
B00929G8SS|1.0|Taken from a Metal Guard web review:<br /><br />My oh my, what has become of the legendary Manowar? When I heard the first measures of the opening title track \\"The Lord of Steel\\", my first impression was actually quite a positive one. There was actually a guitar there, and it was actually playing a riff! However, this enjoyable first impression faded all too quickly, as the rest of the album turned into a rather redundant mixture of supposedly tried-and-true heavy metal and Manowar clichés, ranging from the lyrics which just sound like pieces of former Manowar songs' lyrics put together randomly (\\"Hail, Kill and Die\\"? Really?) over bland song structures devoid of the great and epic moments we've loved so much about the band in the past, to a terrible misuse of one of the greatest voices in heavy metal today in Eric Adams, who isn't even given the chance to really shine and showcase his skills.<br /><br />But that's not even the worst thing about this album. So Manowar haven't written another \\"Kings of Metal\\" with this one. Alright, they also didn't manage to do that with \\"Gods of War\\". Or even \\"Warriors of the World\\", for that matter. But, and this I can but keep shaking my head about it, what in Odin's name have they done to their sound? The artificial drum computer sounds like it's coming straight out of a cheap PC sound card, the guitars pack little punch and the bass... oh Lord of Steel, the bass... seriously, I don't know what Joey DeMaio was thinking when he told his sound engineer to mix his bass sound the way he did, but this just sounds like an explosion in an old 8-bit video game, and nothing at all like a heavy metal bass guitar.<br /><br />But where there's Eric Adams, there's usually always hope. Even if it's but a faint glimmer, even if it is but a straw to cling to; there is always Eric Adams. And this Eric Adams, who in my mind is the single perfect vocalist for this type of classical heavy - or \\"true\\" - metal; well, he stays rather bland and non-descript in this outing. Not because he can't do it anymore like he used to, but because band mastermind Joey DeMaio obviously doesn't let him do his thing anymore. Where are the insane screams, where is Adams' world-renowned \\"Evilizer\\"?! Over most of the record, he just sings in a middle range, and while the feeling and accentuation are definitely there, his great voice is just never given the chance to really impress us. And it's a shame, I tell you.<br /><br />So what remains after we've sat through songs like the cringeworthy \\"Manowarriros\\", the unbelievably cheesily titled \\"Righteous Glory\\", the almost poppy half-ballad \\"Touch the Sky\\", the uneventful \\"Expendable\\" or the at least partially enjoyable \\"El Gringo\\"? Unfortunately not much, my friends, apart from a slightly bitter sensation of disappointment on our tongues, and the feeling that the Manowar who delivered groundbreaking works such as \\"Into Glory Ride\\", \\"Sign Of The Hammer\\" or \\"Kings Of Metal\\", are just irrevocably gone, and have ascended into the halls of Odin far beyond. Maybe all Joey DeMaio can really do well anymore is give strange and self-righteous interviews, talk about \\"trueness\\" and what it's like to \\"die for metal\\"; but I can't shake the feeling that it isn't Manowar who've died for metal, but that it's metal that has died for Manowar.
0515141429|1.0|Implausible.  Terribly written.  In short telegraphic sentences.  Zero character development.  Put the book down after 50 pages.  Wish I could get my money back.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Not the best movie we have ever seen but still very entertaining.  Has some top notch British stars with Judith Dench and Maggie Smith. I do recommend the 4 star rating.

B008XCPO2Q|2.0|Unfortunately, the digital copy of \\"Magic Mike\\" in this package requires a download via Flixter and Ultraviolet.  So far, the digital download isn't working and I've encountered one of their \\"known problems\\", but it's one for which they don't have a fix yet.  I've opened a support ticket with Flixster, but I\\"m not sure what the outcome will be.  I can say that obtaining a digital copy via Flixster and Ultraviolet is turning out to be difficult and frustrating.  Beware of digital copies that require Flixster to download and play!<br /><br />UPDATE: The Ultraviolet support team ultimately provided the fix for my download issue.  However, it took four days to resolve, and I spent way too much time on getting the digital copy downloaded.  (I never had download problems when iTunes was an option.)  Ultraviolet and Flixter say they've resolved most of their linkage and compatibility issues.  I remain sceptical and will avoid purchasing any package that requires a Flixster and/or Ultraviolet download.
1936891026|5.0|I heard about this book on the JRE Podcast. While I don't believe any book can change your life, that power is in the individual, this book has made me aware of the self-deception and self-sabotage that is prevalent in my life. Once you know the enemy, you can begin to take the steps needed to obtain victory. I now exercise every day, eat extremely healthy, and am enrolled back in school to obtain a graduate degree. I hope everyone reads this book and gets as much positive influence out of it as I have. #POWERFUL
B0012NO4WO|3.0|Movie was excitng and action-packed, with a good cast. However, it was too long. It should have ended after the bus. There was no need to do it all over again on a train. That became very tiresome to me.
B000EXZI0K|5.0|The opener: You Should be Dancing. Every song that follows is a hit. An album/cd that can be easily listened to from start to finish. The Bee Gees first role as producers. Another must have for fans.

B007MAETA8|5.0|I am a big fan of John Mayer.  This cd is the best ever.  Every song is an honest account of life and love of life.  I listen to every song over and over and it makes me feel good to be alive.  Thank you John for saying it like it is!
0307744434|5.0|i just don't want this book to end. This is so beautifully written. Some of the most mesmerizing writing in the last decade - move over Shadow of the Wind i have found a new favorite :)<br /><br />Am exactly half way through and am writing this review unbelievable right. i just had to stop and pause to savor what i have just read.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I have been trying to figure out a way to get notes on my kindle for a while... I've seen in my classes all the kids with their iPads and been so jealous as they've seamlessly imported the teacher's pdf slides right onto their screen and took notes effortlessly. I tried a few handwriting apps that were good... but all were missing something... whether it was lack of accessibility, poor handwriting recognition, or their inability to import and annotate pdf docs, I was never satisfied. this app really does seem to have it all!! My obvious favorite feature is of course that this app is made for importing pdfs, but unlike most readers, actually lets you handwrite annotations! With a stylus, it is effortless and beautifully done. I also appreciate that you can write *anywhere* on the screen, whereas most handwriting apps just have a small area in which to write, making it very difficult to write more than one or two words at a time (let alone draw structures as I need to for my current chemistry class!) I highly recommend this app for any college or business people who are looking to take notes digitally.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun. Really hard to put down. You never feel obligated to buy upgrades or coins. Feels like an expensive game :-)
1451695195|1.0|If you buy this book for the experience itself you will be disappointed as I was. Most of the book is about the good doctor, not the experience, and I think I know why: He doesn't have much to tell. Like a dream, you have to experience it, you have to live it. As he says, words are inadequate to describe it. There are many books and films that better convey the after life experience. That the author is a neurosurgeon adds nothing to the reading experience. I returned it.
B00004WZYH|1.0|Unfortunately, I did not realize that this DVD was for a European region.  This was often an issue for old VHS tapes, but we forget the same issue arises with DVD's.  I just threw the DVD away since I have no use for it - cannot be read by my DVD player.<br /><br />By the way, the movie is awesome.  Always an old favorite of mine!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is the best movie! Action, humor, and lots of personality!!! I rarely watch a movie more than once but I have seen this movie twice and would watch it again!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it! very easy to use! definitely recommend it to other kindle fire users. not easy to set up initially though
1476712042|4.0|I would have given this book 5 stars, but the reason I didn't was bc of all of the violence the main character Travis has. It got really annoying whenever someone would come up to Abby or even look at her he would get into a fight , and he always seemed to be at her side on the verge of stalkerish. Don't get me wrong those were the downsides of the book, it was a good read and I couldn't put it down
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This CPU is one of the best CPUs I've ever owned hands down. I had a AMD Phenom II X2 555 unlocked to 4 cores OC'd @ 4.0ghz stable. This cpu blows it out of the water completely. I saw gains across the board in almost every game I played and in my system in general. I have overclocked this cpu to 4.2ghz, and that seems to be enough for me. I have a Thermalright Silverarrow SB-E cooling this monster so heat isn't an issue. The only thing with these types of cpus is that the TIM under the heatspreader may give some people issues if they want to push to 4.5ghz or more. This is because heat cannot be dissipated quickly enough if voltages are on the higher ranges. I did find however that at stock, you can use a negative offset to reduce the voltage needed for a stable overclock. Mine is stable at stock volts right now but this is not hard to achieve. All in all a great all around chip that gave me a very large performance / FPS boost in many games that rely heavily on CPU power. Great job Intel!
1449410243|2.0|I thought this would be a funny book of laugh out loudness, based on the reviews I thought I'd give it a try. It took me a half hour to go through it and didn't find much of it funny. I guess you either love it or hate it . Will be sitting on my bookshelf accumulating dust
B008NABUU8|5.0|great challenge of your engineering skills. love the game.  fun for all ages.  kids can learn a lot from it.
B003JBI2KM|4.0|This book has been written both as a near encyclopaedia of brewing and an entertaining light read. You can go back to it time and again as a reference work with all the detail for an obsessive brewer. Definitely a must have when starting out on the brewing journey
B00984668E|5.0|It starts with amazing cover art and doesn't relent until the feedback drenched final chord. This is the album that The Sword have been working toward and represents the apotheosis of their incredible talent. Composer/guitarist/singer JD Cronise weaves science fiction and fantasy motifs into this heavier than god masterpiece. His vocals are reminiscent of Ozzy but with more range. He completely avoids the cookie monster growl of which I've just never acquired the taste. One might go so far as to say this is the best album Black Sabbath never made. Still, this is uniquely The Sword. The riffage is jaw dropping in its unrelenting intensity. I think the missing piece between this and their previous releases is new drummer, Santiago Vela. Previous drummer, Trivett Wingo was a serviceable percussionist but lacked the chops to fuel Cronise's maelstrom. Like Bill Ward with Sabbath, Vela provides the thunder to perfectly accompany the lightening of the other band members.<br /><br />The deluxe edition contains ten tracks that make up \\"Apocryphon,\\" four live tracks, and a cover of \\"Cheap Sunglasses,\\" a nod to fellow Texans, ZZ Top. For what it's worth, I'm a fan of progressive rock. Lyrically, these guys definitely fall in that genre. Musically, there might be some arguments against that categorization. But one thing I really like about this band is that while they're definitely competent musicians, there's not an ounce of fat, no noodling, no look at how fast I can play showmanship. The playing, from all of the band members, serves the songs.<br /><br />Like many previous reviewers I have seen The Sword live. The mix at the House of Blues in New Orleans was among the worst I've ever heard. (And that goes back to seeing Cream on their farewell tour.) I think Kevin Fender was drumming with them on an interim basis at that time. Anyway, on the strength of \\"Apocryphon\\" and the recommendations of other reviewers, I will plan on catching them again.
B007TK77QE|3.0|A little disappointed in this book. Probably expected too much after Harry Potter. Took a bit too long to get into each character and they didn't feel quite real. She doesn't write as well for adults as she did for kids. All in all okay not a book that makes you feel good, but that is life for many people.<br />Read to see how JK Rowling went with an adult audience, wouldn't recommend as a must read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is great I love it play it whenever I can and takes up a bunch of myfreetime glad its on kindle
B008NABUU8|4.0|Fun game, I'm sure I'll waste many hours plying it in the future. I haven't had any problems with lags or crashes on my crappy little tablet, running ics.
0439813786|5.0|I purchased this book for my 5th grade daughter when she had a huge book report project due. It is truly a piece of art! My daughter does not always like to read and usually doesn't finish a book that she's started. She finished this book, loved it and made a very creative project to turn into to her classroom. I highly recommend this book to anyone!
B007THA4FI|5.0|[[ASIN:B007THA4FI The Casual Vacancy]]  5 stars from me!  Excellent book though you must pay attention and wade through the first eighty percent of this book.  The payoff is the last 10 to 15 percent and what a payoff!  Well done, though dark.  I would compare to Mr. Hemmingway.
030758836X|5.0|I read this book because I had seen it listed on the NY Times Bestsellers list for weeks on end--I figured it had to be worth it. It was.<br /><br />Each chapter changes back and forth from Nick's POV to Amy's diary entries (dating back years, and eventually becoming something else entirely).<br /><br />Amy goes missing on her and hubby's (Nick) 5th (I think) anniversary...you get the feeling that something is off, but cannot put your finger on it. When you get to Part 2, your mind will be blown. As for the ending...I have read a few reviews that it was underwhelming, but I found it to be right in line with the characters personalities and I think most people can draw their own conclusions.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book! So good, I had it done in a weekend.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story was so well written, you could almost feel yourself in the character's shoes.  So awesome, really really enjoyed, I actually bought all 3 books and well worth the money and the time spent ready.  Actually, I am just starting over them again for the second time.  Still just as thrilling as the first time.
1451620829|2.0|Nothing against Peter Criss, but why would he be considered legendary?  Who is he being compared to? I could list about 20 guitarists better than he'll ever be.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It definately was not what I expected, it was MORE.  Oh my, sad to end the book but happy there was a Book 2 and holy moly even book 3, I bought them all and have been so happy with them all.  Not one penny was wasted.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Excellent product, only fits Kindle Fire HD. I had to sell my previous Fire cover when I upgraded to the HD.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|After I purchased the book I started hearing about what was in it and it sounded to sad to be able for me to read.  It took me about 6 months before I finally started to read it and it truly is well written.  Yes, tears came to my eyes and yes, she was so abused, but the story was told in such a dignified manner, if that is possible for what this poor lady went through, I sincerely wish her and her children and family the best life possible.  There are good people out there, BUT WATCH OUT FOR EVERYONE.  So happy she is with family now.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm not really sure how I stumbled across this book, but I'm glad I did. The writing is excellent, the story is compelling and entertaining, and I was sorry when it was over.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie met and exceeded my expectations.  It's about as true a picture of India and it's people as you can find.  All the actors did a great job, and the story was heartwarming.  My biggest \\"take away\\".  \\"EVERTHING WILL BE ALLRIGHT IN THE END.  AND IF IT'S NOT ALLRIGHT, IT'S NOT YET THE END.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Arrived as advertised. It keeps time plus/minus 5 seconds a week. Great performance and excellent value. The Seiko matches my Rolex for accuracy.
B008S80P38|5.0|I got this album the day of it's release, and I was both shocked and pleasantly surprised with the album. This is DEFINITELY NOT the standard CD I'm used to hearing from deadmau5.<br /><br />Things I love:<br />-Zimmerman took us back toward Random Album Title. If for no other reason, buy it for this one.<br />-The exploration of genres in the song selection. In fact, the best on the album in my opinion were the 4 that weren't dance music, and it felt a lot like Get Scraped in many aspects [by the way, I LOVE his house music, so I'm not just being a hipster about it].<br />-The cover and accompanied bonus items [A \\"Strobe\\" remix and the \\"Professional Griefers\\" music Video].<br />-The collaborations with high profile artists of many genres. The man features a punk rocker, an indie artist, a hip hop group, and a electro-folk singer and his album. Genius.<br /><br />Things I don't-necessarily-care-for-but-I'm-not-as-successful-so-I-have-no-room-to-judge:<br />-The album, unlike his other three high profile releases, are not continuously mixed. I REALLY miss this format; it felt more special to me, like each continuous album was dedicated to dance. I assume due to the nature of the songs that are not at 128bpm, it didn't seem practical to do so. That and CD's are becoming outdated anyway, and hardly anyone buys a whole album but rather buy a song at a time on iTunes; with this reason alone it doesn't make much sense to continuously mix the album<br />-Most songs on the album I have favorited on Soundcloud already, which took away the novelty of it. I expected mind-blowing new tracks, and what I got were the tracks I thought he was just goofing with for the social-networkers.<br /><br />In no way am I saying this album is not worth having! In all, the pros far outweigh the my personal beefs. I am still an uberfan.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Good mix of mystery, romance and murder.  this was the first book read by this author.If you‘re a fan of the show you‘ll enjoy the book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Super easy to take notes on your phone, your tablet or your computer and have then sync across all devices. Works perfectly.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Second book and wanting the third!! what   am I supposed to do until next year when the third one comes out?
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book! Can't wait for E.L. James to write another. I enjoyed the whole trilogy. The third book was my favorite.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|If you like puzzles and mysteries, definitely you should buy the full version of the game.  worth the price and fun to play.
B008VBYN80|3.0|A good game,\\"BUT THERE IS NO TECH SUPPORT\\"<br />I have an issue with this game and GAMELOFT ignores any e-mail for help.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The positive:<br />1. Quiet as a mouse<br />2. Solid design and quality<br />3. Keeps CPU incredibly cool for air cooling. I got my i7 950 stable at 4.2 ghz with this thing<br />4: Great price, absolutely can't go wrong.<br /><br />The negative:<br />Back mount plate tends to stick out a bit far, be sure to use padded rubber spacers to keep it off the case.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I like this album better than the last one mainly because I can listen to the whole album without really wanting to skip any songs. Whereas the last album I wanted to skip 2-4 songs every time I listened to the whole thing through.
0385344333|4.0|Lee Child's Reacher novels are so good, and consistently good, that even this one that's below par is still a good read.<br /><br />It doesn't start with a bang, and there are no close relationships formed, to speak of. The bad guys are not built up as<br />really, really bad guys, as they would be in the other novels.<br /><br />I'm nevertheless pleased I bought it and read it. It's still better than most other authors can punch out.
B003JBI4F0|5.0|Easy to read, definitely recommend for people trying to learn the basics of vba programming for microsoft excel.  very thorough
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I watched Cloverfield - (the movie) on cable TV the other night.  In my 59 yrs on this planet I cannot remember seeing a worse film.  Young thin aimless adolescents with no lives running around with a tiny unsteady video camera.  Never mind - it's just awful.
B009LZEZSI|4.0|It was good but charged me several times so wasn't worth watching it. Beware when you purchase to watch videos on here because it will charge you several times.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I'm a big Batman fan but I'd have to say that this one is by far, the best super-hero movie ever, lots of sarcastic comedy, lots of action and if you have a 3D system in home you'll see that it looks way better than the theaters versions. It's worth the purchase.
B008220B0C|5.0|Loved it watched it many times i recommend for Katy's fan love her work and music she seems as a great person
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Looks way better than the theatrical version and it comes with lots of extras. Plenty of things to see about the making of the movie.<br />Just by it self, the movie offers great entretaining, not because of the acction in it but for the richesness of the story, obviously in and hipothetical way.<br />Buy it, watch it, pay close attention to the story and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br />And for the Fan Boys, it's the begining of the Alien story. Pretty Cool!
0380973650|4.0|Before jumping into this rich world illustrated by Gaiman, know that the plot is not as straightforward and as fast-paced as something like his work in the lovely \\"Neverwhere\\".  As someone who grew up and currently lives in the Midwest, the stories in forgotten towns of Illinois and Wisconsin are particularly engaging and delightful.<br /><br />What exactly is taking place \\"behind the curtains\\" and what side each god plays in our protagonist's journey can be hazy.  Some characters are thrown into the story late and leave little time to develop.  The climax is somewhat of a letdown and if you bother to consider the motives of characters like Laura, Mr. Wednesday and others then you might find your head spinning.  It's a fantasy more involved in delivering a message about the culture (or lack thereof) in the United States and what role our ancestral beliefs may or may not play with the country's inhabitants.  Think too much while reading and you'll just miss out on Gaiman's writing style.<br /><br />At times I didn't really know what the hell I was reading, but Gaiman's prose and humor helped me to turn page after page.  I prefer \\"Neverwhere\\" but AG isn't trying to accomplish the same thing.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Finally something to work toward by matching three like items.<br /> A plus one to bejewelled - more levels please.  Good graphics and story line
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It was ok. From all the hype I was kinda expecting to be blown away. I didn't really feel like I ever really connected with any of the characters. The whole movie seemed kind of...shallow...maybe? Not the best movie I've seen by far, but it was somewhat enjoyable to watch.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love Supernatural! This series doesn't disappoint! I would recommend it to anyone and I can't wait for series 8
B005LAIHYU|2.0|They tried to hard to tie in the vampires with the historical facts.  The result was a very confusing, hurried plot that in some cases made no sense.  I was not overly impressed.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Love this record and the band.  I think it is just as good as Sigh No More.  The songs are both catchy and poignant, which is not an easy combination to attain.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|This was once a fun app for android. Ace Hold'em worked fine. Updated to Casino and initially ran okay. Every update has slowed the network so that now it is virtually unplayable.
B0019IB0II|5.0|This book has been a major help in understanding of head injuries as well as strokes.  I purchased this book after my son experienced a serious head injury so we as a family could help him in any way we could.  Thanks be to God he is recuperating rapidly.  Because this book is so informational and easy to understand it has made seeing his need more apparent and easier for us to  help!  Thank you for this wonderful tool.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it. it helps me when I'm doing my math homework. I don't have a big scientific calculator so this helps me out.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love my kindle! I ordered the book after my cousin raved about the series. The book is always better than anything they can produce on TV or in the movies. Loved it! Bought the next book in the series too!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is entertaining it can keep you occupied for forever. It does need to be updated it is way farther behind then the ipad, ipod, or iphone app it also does not have all the mobs, crafting items, and blocks. You can play on multiplayer with other minecraft app users in your wifi. The cost is worth it. I would recommend it to anyone.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Absolutely brilliant, each of the books getting better. Can't wait to read the third book. I give this book five stars.
B002FGU46C|5.0|teva sandles are great the last pair I had lasted about 12+ yrs,and love the comfort,and styling and the straps work well and hold up good,would recommend them to anyone looking for comfort and wear!!OH  YES I FORGOT TO MENTION RECEIVED THEM 5 DAYS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED,GREAT SERVICE
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed!!!! I have been lookin for a new series to read an i am enjoying my selection so far!!
B008NABUU8|5.0|this game is fun because is gives your brain a challenge rather than not at all. I will say this though, it is a little slow between transitions, but other than that it's really FUN!!!!!!!!! :D
B008VBYN80|4.0|I really like this game not only because it fun, but you can change the position of you housing and also can do battles with your friend's.
0316212377|4.0|Iain Banks writes some of the most mind blowing and interesting Science Fiction being produced today.  I was entertained, no enthralled, by every page of this novel.  He paints an galaxy wide picture of a future that I would love to be a part of.  And he does it with the prose of a master.  If only it were true.<br /><br />However... (possible spoilers)<br /><br />As others have pointed out, the resolution of the plot (plot?) may leave you with a feeling of potential wasted.<br /><br />Many science fiction authors have tackled / struggled with the idea of \\"the singularity\\": a future and mankind so different because of technological advances that the humans of today couldn't understand them.  In Banks' future, the usual advances, godlike Minds (AI intelligences), completely plastic bodily forms, reincarnation via technology, integration of human brains with technology -- he goes on and on -- are completely commonplace and \\"understandable\\" (this is where lesser authors fail.)  His story tackles the \\"singularity\\" of entire species being transformed into \\"something else\\" and leaving our universe of four-dimensions entirely to enter a multidimensional \\"other realm\\" which the people of this universe know very little about.  In other words, he pushes the \\"singularity\\" out several thousand years rather than having it happen in our children's lifetimes, as others have struggled with.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this is that he does it by trivializing the most powerful characters in his stories, the Minds that control the Culture's ships.  When others in the story speak of the Minds, they are practically gods.  They certainly seem to have the power of a least Greek/Roman gods and more.  When they talk among themselves, they are more like neighbors gossiping over a back fence.  They are snarky and irreverent.  They decide to do things based on little real evidence.  They can wield enormous power when motivated to do so, but the things that motivate them seem to have more to do with boredom than anything else.  Actually, they do remind me of stories about Greek/Roman gods.<br /><br />So four stars.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book was a real surprise after reading the entire Harry Potter series twice.  It was not as graphic as I expected after reading the reviews prior to getting the book. I could not put the book down once I started it, but the ending was depressing.
B009157BWU|5.0|This was an excellent film... a poignant and touching look at animal behavior... it so clearly illustrates that some things don't change in the evolutionary process from the apes to humans. It also demonstrates that the similarities in behavior between apes and humans, in essence, hasn't really changed that much... both are still based on \\"food chain economics... if you can't defend or protect what is \\"yours\\", someone or something somewhere along the food chain will try to take it away from you or compete for a part of it. It also demonstrates that exceptional things can happen in interpersonal relationships that supersede basic instincts of self preservation and competition for resources... where caring and giving to others becomes as, or, more important than focusing primarily on one's own needs. A great movie for all ages. Tim Allen's narration and the screenwriting was superb. A very touching and eye-opening film! I recommend it highly...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|this is a great book. one thing regarding the fundi christian response.<br /><br />at what point do you guys accept peolles actual experiences and accept the truth that maybe just maybe no ones nde matches the bible.... norlt because satan has some kind of magic power to be at every single person on the face of the planets death..... but because the bible is simply WRONG.<br /><br />honestly peolple. the bible has been wrong about science history and culture. if you are honest to the text its been wrong about virtually everything it says. how many times do you have to change the meaning of a text because it didn't happen like it was supposed to before you finally throw in the towel?
0764141201|5.0|As a former ESL teacher, I'm really impressed with this book. It has a wealth of phrasal verbs that would take a student a long time to absorb and get through. It's got practice material, examples, definitions, etc. I would probably only recommend this for advanced students with a high level of comfort in English, or else it could be overwhelming to remember all the nuances of phrasal verbs in English and how slightly different preposition changes paired with a verb can completely change the meanings. I see this as a great way to challenge advanced students who think they know it all...it's the icing on the cake to mastering English by being comfortable with the multitude of phrasal verbs that English native speakers take for granted that non-native speakers know or should know.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great twists and turns. Each chapter gets better and better! The book started out slow, but improved quickly. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B008OHV4PG|4.0|Journeys is a pretty good film. It includes some amazing Performances from the Twisted Road tour and also some behind the scenes of Neil Young. I expected to have more of the driving and stories about Young's \\"Journeys\\", but the info included was quite funny and entertaining. The concert is amazing, except for a couple songs. \\"Down By The River\\" and \\" Hitchiker\\" have a strange camera shot that focuses on Young's jawline and mouth and does not show much to any guitar work. This was a strange use of camera work. It seems to be a mini cam placed on the mic stand. All in all, this is not as good as Rust Never Sleeps. It ranks up with Heart of Gold. Heart of Gold may be a little better. 4 out of 5.
B008XG1X18|5.0|use it everyday! no issues ever! now if I can find the time to cook crest what I find on there lol
1451695195|5.0|After reading Dr. Alexander's book, Proof of Heaven A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife (which I found out about after reading Newsweek's cover story on it), I listened to skeptiko's youtube interview with it, and I think that others with an interest in consciousness research would also like to take a look at it.<br /><br />Reductive materialism is grabbed onto in a seemingly compulsive way by some who, without any real evidence on either side of consciousness ouside the brain, seem fearful of the idea that there may be more to reality than materialism.  Why would it mess up science as we know it to examine this?<br /><br />Dr. Alexander, was formerly a reductive materialist, and now he's looking into things that seem to challenge that tight little world.
B004LVTTCE|5.0|Great movie, great true story, a must see for anyone who wants to know how to survive anything.  I know, because I only had to survive 24 hours on my own, but it felt like more.  I wish I had a Swiss Army Knife.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|An accurate  account of the world leading up to and including World War One. A fictional story of lives in various country made the story interesting nd entertaining. A great piece of historical fiction-made me purchase the follow up book Winter of the World which I am currently reading
B001PP9ALY|5.0|Movie was full of good action, flashy ideas, and plenty of Angelina Jolie's good looks ;  I would recomend this to anyone :
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I admit, I read all the reviews before getting this book. I am a huge fan and have read everything Lee Child has written. When I got the book, I let it sit on my side table for quite a long time (for me) because I was afraid of being disappointed. I think much of the negative feedback comes from fans just really hating the whole Tom Cruise debacle. Having said that, I agree... Tom Cruise is beyond wrong for the role and I think, based on reading A Wanted Man, that Lee Child thinks so too.<br /><br />Back to the book though, and I'll explain why I think Lee Child is disappointed in the casting of TC as Reacher later. I began the book with dread but... and this is a HUGE but... after about 20 pages, I was hooked into the story, as usual. Fans of Reacher won't really be disappointed in this leg of his journey. Granted, it is not the usual Reacher story,but it is engrossing and Reacher is still the perceptive, never miss a lie guy, as always. It's just a different setting ( a car ride) and the story flip flops from Reacher to another related investigation elsewhere. It will come together at one point, and Reacher does get out of the car. It flows well and I couldn't put it down. Loved the characters, the setting, the two in one story. Never predictable, never slow... I'm not sure what book the others were reading because I enjoyed this book as much as the others. Not all of them are POW in the gut good... but they are all exciting, original, and allows us to hitch a ride into Reacher's world for a moment.<br /><br />As to what I said before, about my thinking Lee Child agrees with us on the miscasting of Tom Cruise... there are many scenes in this particular book where Reacher is physically described... in detail. Doesn't happen as much in any other Reacher novel. It's like Lee is saying, yes, I know, TC was an awful choice. He had no say in the casting so I wish people would not hate on him. He has given us a gift... many books that we all LOVE and a character that means a lot to us. Lee Child did not sit there and cast this film. I KNOW he would NOT have chosen TC. I've seen him many times at book signings and never in a million years would Lee Child have envisioned his beloved character portrayed by TC. Please, fans... don't hate on Lee Child. He is an awesome writer. Read this book... check out the obvious descriptions of Reacher and you'll see Lee's views on who Reacher is...<br /><br />All in all, thought this was a solid Reacher story, in every way... I just hate that I have to wait a year for another. As for the movie... if I don't see it, in my mind, it never happened :)
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Can't say enough about this Blu Ray. Such a good concert to record. Can't wait to see them again in person but this will hold me over until then!
B008NEMN0K|5.0|I've loved I, Robot since it's release; and am thrilled that they put the money & effort into converting it into 3D. _ The \\"3D Conversion\\" process has gotten 1000% better since it's inception; and now, it's rivaling \\"Real 3D\\" (shot in 3D) films... In fact, it's gotten so good, that if I didn't know better, I'd swear they shot this film in 3D to begin with... it's that good! __ I have a 2012 Panasonic VT50 (65\\" - nearly $4,000), so if you get a \\"cheap-o\\" 3D-TV, your experience may not be as good as it could be; but I didn't notice a single mistake/problem w/ the conversion; and believe me, I was looking for them.<br />-- In fact, most people confuse most 3D-Converted Film problems (ghosting, etc.) with it being a problem with the 3D-TV itself -- when in fact, it was a Conversion mistake/problem, in identifying field-depth and so on, during the conversion process.<br /><br />ANYWAY... The first one I saw that rivaled 'Real 3D' and had no errors at all, was Titanic (also a 20th Century Fox release)... So in addition to the conversion technology being vastly improved, this also means that they (Fox) are at least taking the effort (and money) to see that it's done correctly and error-free... even if it means it's a lengthier & more expensive process.<br /><br />My single complaint about this release, is the \\"Bonus Feature\\" dismissal.  The original Blu-Ray release was loaded with (good) bonus features; and while I've come to expect most 3-D Discs having none at all (something Sony has no trouble with, by the way)... I expected it to come with either a separate Blu-Ray disc (normally, identical to the initial release), or at least have the 'best of the best' features included on the DVD. __ Well, there is no separate Blu-Ray disc included, despite it being billed as \\"Blu-Ray 3D / Blu-Ray / DVD Combo\\"... and so, I'm forced to keep my original blu-ray disc & swap it out with the DVD disc included in this \\"combo\\", so I can keep the awesome bonus features (3 Commentaries, Several CG & Behind the Scenes things, and more)... So, instead of selling my extra (Original) Blu-Ray, I now have only the extra DVD to sell (which is another thing... who on Earth, needs, or wants a DVD of this, if they're buying a Blu-Ray 3D version!??)<br /><br />At any rate - Very impressed with the 3D Conversion... Keep 'em coming!<br /><br />PS: I've never said this before; but don't let the 2-Star 3D Naysayer dissuade you... Read my comment to his \\"Review\\" for clarification.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This is a great book to get your juices flowing and it is a great read! Enjoy it alone or with a partner!
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this story as much if not better then the 50 Shades of Grey series. Looking forward to the third book of the series!
0452287022|5.0|We read this book for our book club.  It was unanimously a good read.  Very well written and descriptive.  We were all impressed by the authors imagination of the life of the Girl with a Pearl Earring.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I've tried competing products, and all of them do a better job of protecting your data and your privacy.  Splashtop Remote Desktop requires you to sign up on its website for an account AFTER you have PAID for the software!  Otherwise, the software won't work.  They require personal information, and after you do that they have complete, unfettered access to all of your documents, files, and information on your device.  The EULA admits to harvesting information, so how can you possibly trust them?  Additional signs that this company cannot be trusted is the fact that they refuse to use encryption on the connection.  Therefore, if you use this on a public wifi, anyone can access your device.  The risks aren't worth it, especially at the high price being asked.<br /><br />Additionally problematic is the lack of Linux support.  Strange, because Android IS Linux.  Why isn't the \\"streamer\\" available for Linux?  The company's website is almost derelict in support information, so, of course, Linux is mentioned nowhere on the site.<br /><br />I don't know how they earned so many five-star ratings.  I must assume it is from people who don't have a clue about the security and safety of their data and their information.  My recommendation is to stay far away from this app, and if you already have it I recommend you remove it and find another alternative.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I loved this movie. So much action and so much awesomeness. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies and fairytales. It was the best spin off this SnowWhite fairytale.
B00992CF6W|5.0|stop complaining that it has only a few things its a new gamebthat gets updates every so often which makes it not as good but its still fun
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's a good game but you do have to wait a long time for all the coins to come back.
B005K2LNZ4|1.0|Great album for sure, make no mistake. Unfortunately this vinyl pressing from badder bling is one of the worst you can buy. Surface noise in incredible, ruining this ambient masterpiece. Do yourself a favour and buy on CD or download instead - it really is that bad.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Didn't play the when I was a kid but liked the movie. Great CG and the inclusion of actual military personal added to the 'realism' of actors.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|No Spoilers! - I'm blown away by this book, plain and simple. The writing style is phenomenal. Hugh has a way of painting a situation, giving you detail, but also not overwhelming you with fluff just because its important to the story. He has a way of spending some time in the story with the characters which gives us insight into their thinking. Its not just a story, its a way to hold a mirror to ourselves. Regardless if you like a cerebral story and philosophical inspection or just like to kick back and enjoy a well crafted story, I think it an expertly written story with deep twists and nuances that develop over the 5 books. The first book alone has enough material to give a university philosophy and political science course a semester seminar. Do yourself a favor and make this your next book purchase.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great story line and awesome mini games. kept me busy.<br />most of the games of this type are way to easy to finish. loved it to the end now I need to buy the second one.<br />!
B009SJ46EA|1.0|The first episode you can tell its not gonna be like the first. Its very dark, bloody, tortuous. Where the first season was more about ghost, mystery, and haunted house. It reminds me of a remake of house haunted hill but more dark, bloody, and played out over many episodes. I prefer haunted houses with a good mystery then watching the criminal insane being tortured.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I remember where I was when man walked on moon. I remember where I was when I heard the news about JFK.  I remember where I was when I heard my first Rush song, Called In the End from the just released album called Fly By Night. After being exposed to the noise pollution of Katy Perry and Justin Beiber for the last six months I feel I was cleansed of that filth by Clockwork Angels. The title track is the best song on this CD in my opinion. This album has a different sound when compared to previous Rush albums. Violins and piano is not the usual Rush I am used to, but the more I play this CD, the more I accept it. I guess the Farewell to Kings thru Hold your Fire sound couldn't last forever....
B008JTK9NW|5.0|I love POD and then to hear this new album is truly an amazing thing. They blended some old and new styles to make a great mix where anyone will find something they like.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I dowloaded this game on a whim.  I was instantly hooked. Taught my 6 year old grandson how to play. Great skill for him. Now we are all hooked. Have fun!
B0090O07S2|5.0|If you're into classic rock, then who doesn't appreciate - if not love - The Doors and their contribution to the soundtrack of our youth?  Their music is still burned into our minds and their live performances are the stuff of legend.  To that point, The Doors supplied plenty of post-Independence Day fireworks on July 5, 1968 when the legendary quartet played the Hollywood Bowl, a concert that is considered to be the band's finest on film. For the first time, the film from the historic performance has been painstakingly restored using the original camera negatives and the audio has been remixed and mastered from original multi-tracks by the group's engineer Bruce Botnick. This new restoration offers a stunning visual upgrade from earlier versions and will give fans the closest experience to being there live alongside Jim Morrison, John Densmore, Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek, who opined, \\"You can hear it as if you were at the Hollywood Bowl, on stage with us.\\"<br /><br />LIVE AT THE BOWL '68 will include three previously unreleased tracks from the performance. Technical issues with the recording of \\"Hello, I Love You,\\" \\"The WASP (Texas Radio And The Big Beat),\\" and \\"Spanish Caravan\\" prevented them from being released in the past.

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This was my first time to use Amazon's Instant Stream. And I was plesantly surprized at how well it worked, and great quality especially since I have the worlds slowest DSL and used standard quality stream. As for the movie it was very enjoyable and I really liked the plot and how they all came about as a team of actual misfits that nobody thought they could pull off savin the world. Robert Downey,Jr. really held his own and came through with flying colors. But my whole reason for watching was Scarlette Johansen, she was really great and so was the Hulk. One of the funniest parts of the movie was when Hulk and Thor are fighting side by side and as they finish beating up the Metal Beast and stand together the Hulk cold-cocks him out the picture, man I totally lost it had to pause for a minute or so, also hats off too Joss Whedon who I thought did Marvel Comics great Justice. (Just like he did with Buffy)or BTVS. Can't wait the the sequal.
1451620829|5.0|If, like me, you were a teen in the seventies, you undoubtedly were keenly aware - if not a fan - of the monster rock group, KISS. The drummer (and original member) for the group was Peter \\"The Cat\\" Criss and is one of rock's most iconic figures.  His drumming style has inspired musicians around the world.  Beth, the chart-topping and award-winning song that he wrote and sang, would set the standard for rock ballads. In his much talked about and highly anticipated memoir, Makeup To Breakup: My Life In and Out of KISS, Criss offers an absorbing, eye-opening, and frank account of the incredible life he has led.<br /><br />Criss was KISS's rhythmic and emotional heartbeat.  From the catbird seat of his elevated drummer's perch that housed his sparks-emitting drum riser in stadiums around the world, Peter Criss had a unique vantage point on the greatest rock show of all time. Born as Peter Criscoula, Criss had come a long way from the homemade drum set he pounded on nonstop as a kid growing up in Brooklyn in the `50's. He endured lean years, street violence, and the rollercoaster of the `60's music scene, but he always knew he'd make it.<br /><br />Makeup To Breakup is Peter Criss's eye-opening journey from the pledge to his mother that he'd one day play Madison Square Garden to doing just that. He conquered the rock world, but he also faced the perils of excess and his own mortality, including a near-suicide, two broken marriages, and a hard-won battle with male breast cancer.  Makeup To Breakup offers an exceptional level of honesty and emotion rarely seen in a rock memoir, discussing:<br /><br />· Growing up poor, Catholic, and in violent gangs on the streets of Brooklyn in the 1950's and 1960's, and how hearing Gene Krupa on Benny Goodman's cut of Sing, Sing, Sing and the Ronnettes' Baby My Baby pulled him off the streets to become a drummer. His mother's pots and pans would never be the same.<br /><br />· The New York club scene of the mid-1960's, playing dangerous mob joints, and how one shady promoter held Peter and his band mates captive at gunpoint in his Long Island home until friends came to his rescue.<br /><br />· The formation of KISS in the early 1970's and the importance of people like Bill Aucoin and Sean Delaney who helped shape their unprecedented look and stage show.<br /><br />· The recording of Beth, a song that was originally released as a B-Side, but went on to win the People's Choice Award and become KISS's most popular song of all time.<br /><br />· Peter Criss's hard-fought battle with drugs that ultimately led him to a psychiatric hospital for treatment in 1982.<br /><br />· Starting over in the 1990's and fronting a new band of younger players in the band Criss.<br /><br />· Peter Criss's multiple brushes with death including a horrific car accident and how a 1994 California earthquake interrupted his suicide attempt.<br /><br />· The real story behind leaving the band after the reunion tour: how inflated egos, creative control, and the band's selling-out (and not drug use) created the poisonous environment that drove Peter out of the band.<br /><br />· Being struck with male breast cancer in 2007 (while his wife had her own cancer scare), his decision to go public, and the importance of family and faith in his life today.<br /><br />KISS fans as well as music history buffs and aficionados will definitely want to read this book and keep it in their personal library for future reference.<br /><br />Boomerocity.comus mob joints, and how one shady promoter held Peter and his band mates captive at gunpoint in his Long Island home until friends came to his rescue.<br /><br />· The formation of KISS in the early 1970's and the importance of people like Bill Aucoin and Sean Delaney who helped shape their unprecedented look and stage show.<br /><br />· The recording of Beth, a song that was originally released as a B-Side, but went on to win the People's Choice Award and become KISS's most popular song of all time.<br /><br />· Peter Criss's hard-fought battle with drugs that ultimately led him to a psychiatric hospital for treatment in 1982.<br /><br />· Starting over in the 1990's and fronting a new band of younger players in the band Criss.<br /><br />· Peter Criss's multiple brushes with death including a horrific car accident and how a 1994 California earthquake interrupted his suicide attempt.<br /><br />· The real story behind leaving the band after the reunion tour: how inflated egos, creative control, and the band's selling-out (and not drug use) created the poisonous environment that drove Peter out of the band.<br /><br />· Being struck with male breast cancer in 2007 (while his wife had her own cancer scare), his decision to go public, and the importance of family and faith in his life today.<br /><br />KISS fans as well as music history buffs and aficionados will definitely want to read this book and keep it in their personal library for future reference.<br /><br />Boomerocity.com
0375753419|5.0|Another book assigned for my pre-1900 novels class that I came away absolutely loving. This book is nothing like what you've likely conjured in your mind from various sources over the years. This isn't horror in the sense that it's scary; it's horror in the classic idea that the events described are horrifying.<br /><br />It begins in epistolary form, with a ship's captain writing home to family before he stumbles upon Victor Frankenstein amongst the arctic ice. The captain eventually convinces the doctor to share his story, which becomes the novel. The monster is beautifully written, truly heartbreaking. In the interest of full disclosure, I was immediately drawn into the myriad Paradise Lost references, since that is one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />I recommend this for fans of Gothic horror novels or those just curious to check out the first one. No language or sexuality, and the violence/gruesome elements are mostly glossed over.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. There are so many things to look at. Everyone can find something to pin that interests them.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV shows to come along in a number of years. I initially gave it a go because it was from some of the writers of LOST (which I was a diehard fan of), but through it I've realized how much I just love fairy tales.<br /><br />Almost every episode of the first season plays heavily into the overall plot, with only one or two \\"fillers.\\" Most of the actors are perfectly cast and have you attached to their characters within a few episodes. The intertwining of the disparate stories is well done and logical.<br /><br />I have been pleased with the DVD set itself. I like the slip cover and the case being from the two different sides. There are numerous episode commentaries, a blooper reel, deleted scenes, and several charming featurettes.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|I am quiet.  This book has prompted me to re-frame whole chunks of my life into a new and positive light.  Cain made me immediately remember my Grade Six teacher, Mrs Sue Georgeson, who wrote on my report card that I was a \\"loner\\"; this prompted me to suddenly realise with a horrifying thud that my habit of spending time alone made me a FAILURE.  This was a realisation which I would take with me into my teens and adulthood, and made me struggle constantly to mask, and even obliterate who I really was.  Mrs Georgeson also told me I was \\"over-sensitive\\" and that I needed to \\"come out of my shell\\", \\"mix with the other girls\\" and \\"stop glaring\\".  Mrs Georgeson was a Piece of Work.  My mother told me years later she had wanted to wring the woman's neck on a daily basis.  Even at the tender age of ten I remember being aware that Mrs Georgeson was a narrow-minded person and that I was actually much smarter than she was, but it didn't stop me longing for her approval.  Mrs Georgeson's approval was never extended to me; being super smart, sensitive, observant, empathic and kind won me no prizes with her.  She would have preferred it if I were none of those things, which is part of the reason why I went on to spend a lot of my life pretending not to be them.  It's a pity that Mrs Georgeson had such an effect on my life, and that's why this book of Susan Cain's is so important.  Mrs Georgeson felt happy to tell me I was \\"over-sensitive\\", when perhaps she needed telling that SHE was INsensitive.  This is the all-important change of perspective that Cain is calling for.<br /><br />If you don't believe there's a prejudice against the quiet, consider the recent \\"Sad Keanu\\" meme, in which  actor Keanu Reeves has been publicly punished for the quiet crime of eating his lunch alone.  A paparazzi photo of the man eating his lunch on a bench became an internet phenomenon which culminated in \\"Cheer Up Keanu Day\\".  His crimes?  He looks sad.  He doesn't smile enough. Sounds a lot like Mrs Georgeson telling me not to glare, doesn't it? AND he ate his lunch alone.  There's that word again: \\"loner\\".  Even being one of the most admired and successful humans on the planet doesn't make you immune to playground taunts about being quiet.  Reeves was asked on a British chat show about the \\"Sad Keanu\\" meme; he mumbled and blushed bright red.  It's the reaction of every quiet kid who's ever been attacked with the questions, \\"Why are you sitting here by yourself?  Why do you look so sad all the time? What's wrong with you?\\"<br /><br />Susan Cain's message is that there's nothing wrong with us.  We, the quiet, form an essential part of society.  We are the deep thinkers, the spiritual leaders, the conscience, and much of the creative force and intellectual brilliance of the world.  Yes, we are quiet, and without our quiet, the world would be lost.  (Note to Mrs Georgeson:  Go jump.)
0525423656|3.0|While I wasn't a really strong fan of Matched, the ending of that one had me intrigued enough to give this one a spin. This one manages to be a little weaker, but overall I certainly didn't find it any more boring or uninspired than the first.<br /><br />I like to start with the good, but this one is a little harder. There was definitely deeper characterization, mostly in the form of more back story from Ky. For the most part the new characters introduced to accompany our protagonists on their journeys were interesting and fairly three-dimensional. I especially liked Eli and Vick.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />Vick had me attached enough that his death rather upset me. A contrived plot-point to slow Ky down, but still upsetting.<br /><br />END SPOILER<br /><br />Indie was also interesting, though her actions and attitude began to get more and more annoying.<br /><br />That said, the plot is so forced and basic. The premise of any dystopian novel *is* the entire plot, with barely any attempt at an original spin. In getting to know Ky better, the reader gets to learn how weak, cowardly, and selfish he is. What exactly was his motivation for anything? Then there's Cassia, who has left her family and her cushy life to pursue Ky into the wilderness and yet is waffling on her feelings for him?! I mean, it's pretty healthy to question whether you really love someone, but after all of this is when you start?<br /><br />The setup of this book was different, with chapters alternating between Ky and Cassia's first person points of view. The main ingredient to making this style work is distinction between their voices, which this book is utterly devoid of. Almost every chapter I had to stop and think about which one I was reading about, which had me wishing it had been a running head instead of just at the beginning of the chapters.<br /><br />Other annoyances include an apparent love square forming. Congrats on breaking out of the typical love triangle. The ending is abrupt and weak. The second book in a trilogy is supposed to be actively propelling you into the third one, not casually meandering into it. And don't even get me started on how useless the map in the front of the book is.<br /><br />Despite these personal annoyances, I still recommend this series for younger girls who want to read dystopian fiction but aren't up to the likes of The Hunger Games or Divergent.<br /><br />The pacing isn't very fast, especially as this one relies more heavily on poetic passages. There are few red flags. Ky and Cassia share numerous kisses but nothing more serious. There is more violence and death, though it isn't described in great detail.
B001F290E4|5.0|This is my first CD of Seal.  I don't know what took me so long to purchase one, but I'm enjoying it.  So mellow and full of Soul.  I can't stop playing it.  I will be purchasing some more soon.
0062068415|4.0|I picked this up in an airport before a return flight after unexpectedly finishing my only other book on the way out (and one does not go without a book when flying from Los Angeles to Ohio). I was early, so I had plenty of time to search, but nothing else in the tiny shop sounded as interesting as an old asylum for the criminally insane, despite Leonardo DiCaprio's face staring at me. I'm glad I overcame my dislike of the actor and chose this one, as my first Lehane didn't disappoint. (Consequently, Leo didn't disappoint in his role in the film, either)<br /><br />The story jumps right in to the tale of an FBI agent who has been called with his partner to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a woman from her locked cell. The characterization was engrossing and deep, which helps make the twist at the end all the more unexpected. The writing style was fast-paced and interesting, keeping me reading throughout most of the flight.<br /><br />There was a good smattering of language and some sexuality that some readers may want to know about beforehand. The tension throughout was kept perfectly tuned, and the ending put a great twist on a somewhat tired plot device.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Awful film, thoroughly disappointed given its fantastic cast.<br />Not worth paying to see, I'd wait until its free on prime :(
1442419814|3.0|When Amazon says three stars means \\"it's ok,\\" I take it at face value. This one was neither good, nor was it bad. Probably better for slightly younger readers who may not be able to handle something like The Hunger Games and can overlook the sometimes strained dialogue.<br /><br />This book boiled down to 75% repetitive description of hoverboarding, 15% description of how ugly/pretty people are (using a very limited set of vocabulary words), and 10% something actually happening. I liked Tally's sense of adventure, and her opening scene visiting the pretty village was riveting. At first it seemed like a pretty good world was being built and it definitely sucked me in quickly.<br /><br />However, after the initial climb up the hill, instead of a thrilling ride down, there was a mild decline that provided some interest but nothing spectacular. The setting plateaued and was unnoticeable for the remainder. The characters began verging on being cliches of what teenagers \\"should\\" be like. The story was solely responsible for advancing itself because the characters had little depth beyond thinking about outward appearance and a forced romantic relationship. Even when Tally starts realizing she likes it better in the Smoke, the author doesn't truly let the reader in on that process.<br /><br />I'm very much an advocate that readers need to have a moment where they consider whether a character is well-drawn/makes sense in the world they have grown up in. While I can see where she would be obsessed with little other than becoming a pretty, there was something off. Maybe it was that Tally actually felt a little too much like she could have been from our world? I can't really put my finger on it.<br /><br />Now, I have to grant this novel that it was ahead of the curve on teen dystopians. I'm sure without the great books that have followed in recent years to compare it to, it would have been more spectacular for me. Overall, certainly a decent addition to the YA canon, but not stellar.
B0061P2L5U|5.0|In a comprehensive and compelling book, Moises Velaquez Manoff has provided an updated version of the hygiene hypothesis to explain: Why is there more autoimmune diseases in the modern world?<br /><br />While the idea that we are now no longer exposed to enough pathogens and therefore our immune system is beginning to attack our bodies is certainly not new, the author has provided a comprehensive review of the lots of new evidence supporting this hypothesis.<br /><br />This area of research is growing rapidly and as an active research scientist in this field, I found this book to be a terrific compilation of almost all the most important studies out there. Through interviews with most of the leading scientists in this field, the author has been able to synthesize their thoughts into laypersons terms.<br /><br />I gave this book to my parents after reading it, because it explained to them the concepts behind the type of research that I was doing now. Indeed, if I were to have the time, this would have been the book that I would have liked to write. There are very few things missing in it, and indeed many more ideas and stories that I had never come across.<br /><br />The book is also livened up by personal stories of individuals who have taken matters into their own hands by infecting themselves with parasites to treat their symptoms of auto-immunity. Indeed, the author chronicles his own voyage in this regard. His writing captures the personalities of some of these individuals very well and reminds us that these autoimmune diseases are devastating many lives in our modern world.<br /><br />The author starts by describing how the environment we live in has undergone rapid changes from the perspective of the microbes that we are exposed to and then begins to examine, one disease at a time, how these diseases may be linked with exposure to microbes. What has revolutionized this field over the last few years has been the increased appreciation of how our commensal gut bacteria affect our immune systems and this book will bring you up to date with the most recent studies in this field.<br /><br />Through interviews with scientists, a picture is painted of how parasites and microbes may provide protection against diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, multiple sclerosis and so on. A particularly interesting idea is put forward regarding the effects on pregnancy and autism, which was also discussed in a New York Time opinion piece.<br /><br />This book is a terrific read for anyone interested in how the immune system interacts with pathogens and commensals, providing a laypersons explanation for the rise of diseases where the immune response is dysregulated. This hypothesis is now in the main stream of science and no longer a fringe idea and is a very exciting place to be as a research scientist.

B00902MCVY|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever heard.  The album flows together perfectly.  Others complain of the short length of the album, but I think the length works perfectly to keep the tracks flowing properly.  Instead of a longer album that contains a handful of good songs and a handful of not so good songs, this album is a bit short, but every song is amazing. Worth every penny, and worth the eight year wait.  Buy it.

It's a rare book that you can't figure out until the very last page and it leaves you breathless. I thought about this book day and night.

1401937519|5.0|Once I started reading Anita Moorjani's book, [[ASIN:1401937519 Dying To Be Me: My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Healing]], after hearing about her story on an internet radio program, I couldn't put it down.  This is definitely not your typical near-death experience book, as the author doesn't waste time attempting to explain away what happened to her by discussing scientific or medical theories.  Instead, she speaks of the cancer that ravaged her body and her subsequent miraculous healing as part of a magnificent journey, which to her surprise has nothing to do with blame, shame, or guilt.  She finds that living the life she was meant to live--one of freedom and self-love--is not based on culture, ethnicity, social status, religious background, or even one's relationships with others.  She discovers that having a loving relationship with herself, one that includes kindness, compassion and doing the things that feel right for her, has given her the capacity to be truly authentic in her relationships with those around her.<br /><br />There are so many profound messages contained within the pages of this beautifully written book that a one-time read probably won't cut it for most people.  Also, a good point of reference is the author's Questions and Answers in chapter eighteen, where she addresses the most common questions that have been asked during the many conversations she's had with people from around the world.

0439813786|4.0|I was going to start this review with a recollection of how I ended up in a hot tub with Brian Selznick, but I think I've dropped that particular name enough for one lifetime, so I'll just leave it at this: librarianship can make for some pretty weird anecdotes.<br /><br />Anyway, at first glance, this book seems hefty for a children's story. Opening the cover reveals an ethereal mix of hand-drawn sketches and sparse, elegant prose that unfolds like a mix of picture book, fable, and silent film. I can't think of anything else like it.<br /><br />The story is deceptively short enough that I don't want to give too much away. Hugo Cabret is an orphan that lives in the walls of a Paris train station, taking care of the clocks and stealing food to survive. Every now and then, he visits the toymaker's booth in the station and makes off with small windup animals, which he cannibalizes for parts to repair a miniature figurine he keeps in his room. The mysterious automaton is the only memento Hugo has left of his father, and he is convinced that if he gets it working it will impart an important message. When the toymaker catches him one day, it sets off a chain of events that connects Hugo's mechanical man with the dreamlike movies his father used to talk about, and forever alters the lives of both Hugo and the toymaker.<br /><br />The most striking elements of the book are the two-page illustrations that frequently intersperse the narrative. They can be disorienting at first, until the reader realizes that they are integral to moving the story along. They are scenes in themselves, rather than mere accompaniment. The pictures are wonderfully drawn, and framed in such a way that something almost like animation emerges if you flip through them in just the right way. Selznick's prose is simple and straightforward; all of the charm and wonder resides in these visual interludes.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have with the book is that things get a little anticlimactic nearthe end. Selznick builds so much fantastic wonder, especially in the beginning, that the resolution feels exceptionally earthbound. This in itself is a bit of a brilliant stroke, though, as the story was inspired by a real turn-of-the-century filmmaker and his odd collection of automata. Taken as a whole, The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a paean to how extraordinary the little quirks and foibles of ordinary life can be, especially when you are twelve years old. Despite its impressive page count, this can be read in a day, and is filled with enough enchantment to hook readers of any age. I plan on putting it in my son's hands as soon as he's able to read on his own.

This book does not disappoint and can be read by a vast majority.  Even those without a financial background can enjoy the reading this.  It almost reads like a suspenseful novel with humor and drama.  I would have only wished for a better ending to this story.
B0058VW36U|3.0|this is spittle fun because all you do is just cut the stylus rope so the dumb thing can drop
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My son recommended this book for me.  He said it was really good, but I couldn't believe HOW good.  I couldn't put it down.  I read fast, and sat down in one day and read it from start to finish.  I just found out #6 has come out, and I'm downloading it now!  I wish I had the ability to write reviews like others, so, it's fantastic, awesome, brilliant, delightful and fun!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just as good as the first one. the ending definitely leaves you hanging. it makes you wonder what adventures ana and christian will endure in the third book!!!

B008NEMPTO|5.0|This movie was made for mostly the 3D affects, and I do say, it was pretty damn awesome in 3D. Amazing acting, story writing, character details, and the graphics. Wow, amazing Graphics, perfect quality. I give this movie a 5/5 star rating! One of the best Tim Burton films I've seen in a long time, well done Timmy, Well Done.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita's story is well written so that everyone can easily understand her message.<br />Her message is simple: be yourself at all times and with everyone. I tried that<br />with my physician and found him to be very human! We all have been afraid of death<br />due to the old teachings of the ancient world.Now is the time to WAKE UP!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Katniss has won the Hunger Games with Peeta.  But has she?  At what cost?  This world she lives in is very scary.  This book is quick and well characterized, and is necessary as the centerpiece for the trilogy.  It isn't as interesting to me as the first and the last, but definitely well worth reading.
B00136NVH4|4.0|I've always enjoyed Meatloaf's music and Bat Out Of Hell was no exception.  I have heard either Bat Out Of Hell 2 or 3 and did like one of them better but I have yet to really look for for it. I would suggest that you try and listen to the samples of 2 and 3 before buying this album.  Of course I am enjoying this album but I'm pretty sure one of the others might be better.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Not bad at all but its a complete and total time waster. It is a game meant for when you have nothing to do and need to blow off steam.

B001G5ZNDM|5.0|i like this lp a lot. it is very rich of musical idea and deep on synphonical depth. it is easy listening and entertaining, and you wil aknowledge that this is done by people who know what they are doing at heart. and therefore go out and buy it at a real record store (yes the small ones!). it is hand made, it should be sold by hand, and if you do so, you get that time and jazz a little closer... from the heart, done by hand, handed from one to antoher... now you dig it...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! It is SO addicting.  One of the best free games I have downloaded! Just wish that the free coins repleneshed faster. I can't put it down!

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Wonderful app.  I set different alarms to go off on different days that I have to remember kid activities, etc.  I also use it to remember medication doses.  Since I only need the &quot;math to snooze&quot; function when waking,  it is only on that alarm.<br /><br />I use this on the Kindle Fire and, yes,  I plug it in at night so that I don't have to worry about the battery. But I did that before I had the alarm to recharge for the next day--so what's the big deal?  I leave the fire in &quot;sleep&quot; mode with the screen off and the alarm turns the fire on when needed.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|I saw this at the movie theater and liked it so much I purchased the DVD today. I would call this an entertaining and creative movie. The story line is original and fresh. The acting is great. If your stupid and think a movie about vampires should be historically accurate because the main character is Abraham Lincoln then this movie is not for you. Give this movie a chance! Sit down with a bowl of popcorn, plug in this movie and enjoy the ride! You will like it. It may be about vampires but I did not find it scary if that is a concern.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I chose this book because it was highly rate by alot of reviewers. It has a unique story line and was easy to read.  There was quite alot of details in describing the circus but I would have also liked greater character development.
B008NW67E0|5.0|After their first album, I thought it impossible for Mumford & Sons to do anything even nearly as good on their second outing, but I was wrong.  This album is amazing.  I love every song.  Some people say it sounds just like the first album, but I disagree.  They have a certain style that is not familiar to most, so it is hard to make out the differences.  It's like looking into the sky and thinking all the stars look exactly the same, when the truth of the matter is that they are all different shapes and sizes, with some being far more brilliant than the others.  This album is one of the brilliant stars.  My only small complaint is that this album is a little less raw and gritty than the first, but that is expected.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I've just finished reading this book and was looking forward to enjoying it as I love all the Harry Potter books. I was disappointed in the story line and found it boring and a bit depressing, not one character was happy and it seemed to drag on and on. I would not recommend this book
B008I3QZKU|3.0|This album was hard to listen to at first.  There are no real standouts that grab your attention from the get go.  That being said, after a few listens, I did start to appreciate the album without having to force it just because I love all their other albums.  As the title says, I think the album is good, but not at all great.  I'm sorry, but all too often \\"die hard fans\\" like new albums because they are blinded by their obsession with a band. If you like it, great.  That being said, I have a hard time believing that if this were The Killers first album, that any \\"die hard fans\\" would be made.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Great follow up  to \\"[[ASIN:1250007305 Zero Day: A Novel]]\\", and the plot take the two main characters further and also gets into their pasts a little more.  Mark also does a great job of tying in some recent events in the world, a nice touch.<br /><br />Novel keeps up a good pace and is an overall great read.

B001BFFTO0|5.0|Really nice pair of boots.  Other reviewers are correct.  This boot runs about a size larger.  My Asics running shoes are size 10.5 4E, my Wolverine work boots are size 10M.  I ordered these in a 9.5 W and after receiving them, I could have easily worn a 9, but the 9.5 will give me enough room to wear thicker socks during the winter.  Great price too! Was originally looking at them on Zappos, but they were $165!!!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|The 3 book trilogy of Fifty Shades was a great read, I enjoyed the 2nd and 3rd books the best more of a romance to the story line,  I would definitley recommend this trilogy
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|This was a very goofy movie, but I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />I really liked that the adults were the focus of the drama, not the kids. So often, movies are all about the kids, with the adults just as programmed NPCs (as it were).<br /><br />Plus- I grew up with Abba songs, and they are so ear-wormy!<br /><br />Anyway- I thought it was sweet, and a lot of fun, and an excellent romantic comedy.
1607066017|3.0|Love Y The Last Man and Ex Machina.  Saga has clever stuff in it and AMAZING art.  I grew tired of the conceit of characters in an epic alien multiverse talking like they're in modern-day LA.  It's an interesting juxtaposition, but it took me out of the story.  All I could think about was the fact that it didn't MATTER what any of these characters looked like, what their strange alien history was, what weird landscape they were in, etc., as none of that affected the characters or how they acted or talked.  BKV could have written them as humans in Los Angeles in a gang war and nothing would have changed.  That might work for some people but it didn't do it for me.
B008S847X2|5.0|Now Here This does definitely come from the same type of vision that resulted in Industrial Zen, Floating Point, To the One, and even Five Peace Band. McLaughlin has lots of energy and drive with his current direction, and of course there's no question about the chops still being there. There's no let up by the guy who powered the Mahavishnu Orchestra, dazzled with Shakti, charmed with the Translators, grooved with the Free Spirits, and scored classical pieces.<br />My joy with Now Here This centers on the fact that several of the compositions seem to be particularly inspired. They come from the deep place that McLaughlin goes to write and produce pieces that are more than vehicles for the great virtuosity he and his cohorts can bring to just about anything they might play.<br />Many guitarists have astonishing technique, and John opened the door for lots of them. Having said that, the thing that I've always loved about him is the inspired writing that he's capable of. McLaughlin compositions through the years like Lotus Feet, Nostalgia, Earth Ship, Zamfir, The Daffodil and the Eagle, Guardian Angels, and Letter from India have been what have always kept me coming back to his new releases. Now Here This has 3 such pieces in Wonderfall, Not Here Not There, and Guitar Love. What great compositions!<br />Of course there's lots of burning playing on Now Here This, and those who look at guitar playing as an athletic event will have lots to admire. The band is terrific throughout and I hear no problem out of the transition from Mondesir to Ranjit Barot. I hope McLaughlin keeps going as he ages (along with the rest of us). He's got a lot left in the tank and can still inspire. I selfishly hope that he'll tour with this current 4th Dimension in the US so we can hear some of these recent tunes get their due in a live setting.<br />Buy this cd, and support this wonderful artist and music!
B009NQKPUW|1.0|We can create a short list of the attributes of this movie. Let's see: dumb and incoherent script, dumb characters, dumb scientists that would seem to have been chosen for a hugely expensive space exploration by their level of incompetence and stupidity, a deranged android. One can easily imagine to be watching one of those awful and cheesy 1950s science fiction movies, if it not were for the beautiful and shamelessly wasted special effects of this one.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham's \\"Racketeer\\" is excellent, suspenseful and entertaining. Mal, the main character who is black, a first for Grisham I think, is brilliant, complex and well-written.  I haven't enjoyed a Grisham book this much since \\"The Firm.\\"  Aspects of this book remind me of another recent political thriller \\"Divided We Stand\\" by Howard Steinberg, yes you must suspend disbelief at the start, and then it just sweeps you along.  Like David Baldacci, Grisham keeps your heart racing.  Enjoy!
0553382152|1.0|Do not buy this book because it's fake.  Over the decades I have read dozens of books about Near Death Experiences from the classic modern Life After Life to the relatively ancient Death Bed Visions.  All have common threads in them that this book does not have.  Consider that the author's alleged NDE experience happened unwitnessed.  The content of the book was clearly \\"made-up\\".  \\"Embraced by the Cash\\", is a far better title for this book.  If you have to read it, get it from the library, and you will agree with me, sorry to say.  There are many wonderful books on the topic out there, pick one or more of them!  When the author was on Opra, at the time, discussing her new book, a famous NDE experiencer was asked his opinion and he was polite and professional, yet he was scowling big time because he experienced a real NDE, and he knew the book was hookum.
B008X8QCTO|2.0|I bought this game for only .99 but feel cheated.  The game is not up to other Alawar games (like Twisted) but would provide a pleasant afternoon if it had not stopped abruptly to request more money - without informing the would be buyer exactly how much money would be required to continue or finish the game.  I will be very careful before purchasing (even at a great price) another Alawar game.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Writing a review or completing a satisfaction survey are not usually fun things to do and most people don't do them.<br />Just having a review, even if it isn't a good one, means you made someone feel compelled to spend a few of her precious minutes.<br /><br />Well, Mr. Howey made a lot of people feel compelled to write a review. He made me feel compelled to write this one, my first one.<br /><br />When you read WOOL, strange as the title might seem at first, you soon understand why.<br /><br />I'll just say that it has made it to my private \\"hall of fame\\" of books, just besides Isaac Asimov. A small selection of books I liked so much, that I often come back to read them again.<br /><br />It's a true original and fresh approach to science-fiction, a believable picture of a possible and not so distant future of the human race. Buried in a \\"silo\\".<br /><br />Mr. Howey has a very clear and engaging writing style. He can make you care for even short-lived characters. It's amazing how in a few paragraphs he makes you understand how the character feels, how he got where he is now and why he is acting like he's acting. Maybe to kill him a few pages forward...<br /><br />I've recently read other books that, even if the story was awesome, I would have removed one out of each three sentences. You will not find such here. Every sentence, every word is meaningful and adds to the story. A story you will not be able to put down until you finish it, be warned.<br /><br />Mr. Howey, one of these days I'm going to bump myself against a streetlight while I read your books in my phone!<br /><br />And you, my fellow reader, make sure you get \\"First Shift: Legacy\\" the minute you end with WOOL.

B000KJT8IG|4.0|The third installment of the Vacation series finds the Griswold family traversing the perils of the Christmas holiday season.  This is Chevy Chase's best performance as Clark Griswold.  He perfectly mixes the goofiness of the character with a touch of sentimentality that all successful Christmas movies have.  Clark wants to have the perfect family Christmas and of course his carefully detailed plans go awry.  There are some hysterical scenes involving hanging Christmas lights on the house and shopping in a downtown Chicago department store.  The cast are all funny and the film is worth watching for Mr. Chase alone.
0439023521|5.0|The book Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a thrilling and adventurous book. This first person narrative was very interesting and I enjoyed the detailed observances of Katniss Everdeen and the suspenseful situations throughout the storyline. The setting is in a nation called Panem that has been through a huge civil war with rebel forces and the powerful government known as the Capitol. The main theme of the story is power and control. The Capitol is in charge of all of the 13 districts and is very strict, and in some cases extreme in its laws and punishments. When the Capitol was at war with the districts they ended up annihilating district 13 to set an example to the rest of the districts.<br /> The story begins with 16- year old Katniss Everdeen, the main character who lives in district 12. Her family, Primrose and her mom are poor and without a father, who died in a coal mine accident. Katniss was very close to her father, he taught her to hunt and gather roots outside the district fence. Although she continues to hunt in order to support her family and trade at the hob, the black market of district 12. Katniss's hunting buddy Gale accompanies her on her hunts for game to feed both their families. They often talk and express strong feelings about the corruptness of the Capitol and its annual hunger games when alone in the woods.<br /> The hunger games, where there is a drawing to select 2 tributes a boy and a girl from each district ages 12-18 the Capitol enforces it to represent its victory against the rebel forces and their power over the districts. President Snow is the president of Panem and is in charge of everything, including choosing game makers to help decide the outcome of the games. In district 12 Effie Trinket announces the tributes and accompanies them throughout hunger game preparations. Katniss's sister Primrose is called and so Katniss steps forward and Peeta is called to attend the 74th annual hunger games. They now have to compete in the hungergames against 22 other tributes. They prepare for the hunger games by getting advice from their advisor Haymitch, the town drunk. I believe each main character plays a strong role in the novel, and that helps create a good plot. I like the selection and how the author builds onto the main characters. Also the author hints here and there how much the citizens of Panem disagree with the strict rule of the Capitol.<br /> The setting of the book, like I said earlier, Panem is centered with the capital and all the remaining 12 districts are located around the capital. Panem, that has been free of war for 74 years, has a strict government and reminds me of modern countries that are ruled by dictatorship. Suzanne's choice of writing in the first person point of view of Katniss makes the story a whole lot more intense and creates more imagery. There are so many mixed emotions and right away you lean to hate the Capitol. You realize the environment Katniss and the citizens of Panem live in is hostile and unmerciful.<br />Personally I loved the book and everything about it. Some of my favorite aspects of the book are the suspense, the details, the unpredictable plot, main characters, and the setting. This book was a great start to the trilogy that includes Catching Fire and Mocking Jay. I would highly suggest reading this book especially if you like adventure books, suspense, and a fantastic plot.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Could not put the book down.<br /><br />I am not one to write large reviews. I am to the point unlike others who want to tell you the whole story in their writings.<br /><br />Very glad they made the child more adapting into the story and the Volturi left them alone when all is said and done. Thought Alice was gone forever as I could not imagine the remainder of the book without her.<br /><br />Transformation, birth, getting other vampires were all keys to not putting the book down. Sticking up to bullies no in today's age is exactly what the Cullins did in this book. Would of been nice to obtain more information within whom they recruited.<br /><br />Cannot wait to see how they play the last part of the book to the movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book Catching Fire, written by television writer and novelist Suzanne Collins, is the second book of the Hunger Games trilogy. The first book in the series is The Hunger Games, followed by Catching Fire, and finishing the trilogy is Mocking Jay.  Catching Fire is the continuation of Katniss Everdeen's journey of survival in District 12 of Panem.  In this book, she has returned, as well as Peeta, as a victor of the 74th annual Hunger Games and starts out her year as a victor with the Victory Tour.  As she finishes the Victory Tour, she comes home only to find out that a rebellion against the oppressive Capitol has begun.  And now, as the Games approach, all the districts are reminded that this year marks the third \\"Quarter Quell.\\"  The \\"Quarter Quell\\" occurs every 25 years and it allows the Capitol to introduce a twist to the Games.  It just so happens that in the \\"Quarter Quell,\\" all 24 victors from the previous Hunger Games will be put back into the arena to fight to the death.  With this news, Peeta and Katniss both become interdependent.  They are both trying to keep the other alive.  As a matter of fact, they end up wanting the other to survive more than they want themselves to survive.  As the victors go back into the arena, you will see how the competitors prepare themselves and who still knows all the moves in the arena.  You will be surprised to find out who pairs up with whom and who comes out on top.<br />After reading The Hunger Games book, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Catching Fire and engross myself in the second book of the series.  The first book kept me interested at every moment and scene while I was reading it.  There was never a dull spot.  I was always on the edge of my seat waiting for something amazing to happen and I never fell empty-handed.  Once I could acquire a copy of Catching Fire, there was no stopping me from sticking my nose in that book and never taking it out.  There is a surprise around every corner and I was shocked with every one of them.  Suzanne Collins kept the suspense going throughout the entire book.  With the interdependence between Peeta and Katniss, the book is so much more intriguing because of the fact that Katniss is trying to save Peeta and Peeta is trying to save Katniss.  It is an amazingly written novel and I would suggest this trilogy to anyone looking for a good read.every one of them.  Suzanne Collins kept the suspense going throughout the entire book.

0385344333|4.0|Good read and great character.  Just can't seem to reconcile Tom Cruise playing Reacher in upcoming movie.  Any physical description by author, Lee Child, regarding his hero, Jack Reacher, would seem to disqualify Tom Cruise....but Hollywood is Hollywood.  Any true Reacher fan will not be able to make that leap, no matter how great the technical skill of the movie crew.
0374214913|4.0|This was a feel good book from start to finish.<br /><br />Clay Jannon is a victim of the financial meltdown of recent years. Out of work as a web designer he takes a job at Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, a very unusual store that has very few paying customers and a group of customers that only come in to borrow books from the `other store' in the back.  With a lot of time on his hands Clay begins nosing around and soon finds himself knee deep in a mystery, a secret society, code-breaking and more. But the Da Vinci code it is not. It is firmly set in modern times, right in the heart of Google country, but the mystery goes back hundreds of years.<br /><br />This is a book lover's book, but it is also a book for nerds. The love of books, both written and electronic; using computers and the almighty Google to help crack the code; a secret society in an underground vault in NYC; a much loved sci-fi author who was once a member of the society; the search for immortality; 3D computer visualization; a love story; friendship and an adventure that changes all the parties involved.<br /><br />The mystery is clever; the characters are fun, quirky and believable. The book reminded me a lot of Ready Player One, which I read early this year; it has that same love of the kids who played Dungeons and Dragons and somehow use that knowledge to save the world!  It was fun, fun, fun.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games<br /> The book Hunger Games written by Suzanne Collins is a fictional novel that is very interesting to many people. There is a movie about this book because it was so popular. But the movie is very hard to understand if you don't read the book first, so this is my purpose of writing this review to get you to read this book. This book among many other books she has written is and great and a fast read even for slow readers.<br /> One of the reasons her, the author, books are easy to read are because her style of writing. She has a very informal way of writing, like she writes it how you would say it. So as to help draw in her intended audience, which in fact people in early to late teens. Why I say that is because the main character is a 16 years old girl. She is very good at make sure that the intended audience knows who there are by the way she words her books. She makes you feel as if you are part of the story; the detail in the book is amazing. If the was a different shape of brown in a tree she told you about it, the detail is what I thinks brings her stories to life unlike some other authors. But the cliff-hanger at the end is epic and how it makes you go and get the next book, it will make do this I promise you that much.<br /> Now let me tell you more about the story... This all take place in future America and the country has been ravaged by warfare. What is left has been divided into 12 districts and a central capital district like modern day DC. The main character, Katniss Everdeen , is as stated early a 16 year old girl trying to take care of her mom and little sister Primrose after her dad died. But she doesn't do the really safe way as you will read. Now I said that so as not to give away the book as other reviews do.  I find it really annoying to be honest with you. But she does what she needs to to keep her family alive and she is doing well until the yearly election you could call it to see who goes to the hunger games. But I won'tgo into detail because then the beginning in ruined. The main theme behind this book is very important and Katniss's struggles to keep her family alive is very harrowing and is how we should strive to be. I think the theme is to always keeping going no matter what is in your way. That is really why I recommend this book to everyone.
B003EYVXSW|5.0|I already knew it wasn't anything like Species as I read about that before I bought it. But I did liked the show but it probably isn't for everyone. Adrien Brody is a terrific actor. I enjoyed the character Dren (played by Delphine Chaneac). She does an fantastic job at making her character convincing, interesting and even attractive. Everyone knows playing with mother nature always turns out to be disastrious. The ending does leave it open for a sequel.

Knowing how to stay alive and when necessary to play the game. Peeta needs to grow some, and prior to the movie coming out I had voices of certain people which made the book more interesting.<br /><br />Wonder if our world will ever come to something like this.<br /><br />PS-- read before the movie came out. Was impressed the movie and book were just about the same minus the details you cannot obtain or movies would be four hours long.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am in love with this app end of story. I would recommend it to everyone and I am so glad it has come into our lives
B007U4DIM6|5.0|I bought this with my granddaughter in mind (alright it was also for me). We enjoyed the movie as it was entertaining. There are many different kind of dog breeds and the chihuahua family with their human family lives and works at a canine hotel. The little dog outfits are cute, now my granddaughter expects me to buy outfits for our little dogs. The movie is worth it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book. As a high school student in the 90's, this took me back in time and it was easy to relate to what Charlie was going through. Looking forward to seeing the movie.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|I've tried a half dozen times to install this...no go. It tries to install which is SLOW, but won't run. Then I'm back to Install....maybe I don't have space although there is no indication of that.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is the greatest game around.  It is skill, luck and hatred of pigs, all rolled into one.<br />I first played this game on my granddaughter's IPod.  As soon as it was on my Kindle Fire my husband<br />and I have almost played it nonstop.  We are 65 and 62 years of age, retired and have plenty of time<br />and energy to play this game.  It is great, especially the sounds!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I won the Trilogy series.<br /><br />I have stopped reading because I am one with wanting to read and then watch the movie. If I start reading the third book then I am going to forget about this, even thought he last words of there is not district 12 stuck in my head for months!<br /><br />Nice to see the different players in this, and sad to see the elderly go. They seemed like nice people.<br /><br />However, until I read book three I am sick of the government controlling the game. For once, can they let the players play no matter how long it takes?<br /><br />Cannot wait to see how book three is and the movie in two when it comes out next year.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Kindles apps are way below par compared to the Apple apps. Its like amazon already knows that your not buying the kindle for its apps so they dont even try to do it well
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase and can't wait until season 4 comes out on DVD. I will purchase it from amazon again like I do everything else! Product arrived brand new and in a short amount of time. Packaging and service was great. Highly recommend.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Why I can´t take the battery out? Awful. And why is not compatible with portable digital recorded. I just try it into a DSRl camera and works but I really need it to work into the difital recorded
0756697875|5.0|arrived within a day.great quality and is being enjoyed daily.my son was so excited and surprised by how fast it arrived
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Is it erotica? Yes.<br />Is it repetitive? Yes.<br />Does it deliver? Yes.<br />Is it for everyone?  No.<br /><br />Did I read all three books in 3 days?  Yes.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|If you are looking for a more country sound, this may not be the album you want. I love it. I am NOT a country music fan, but like certain country singers/bands. I am definitely more of a pop fan, so this album is awesome for me! When Taylor first came onto the music scene I was not impressed. I thought, okay, twangy little girl with an okay voice. Then her second CD came out and I started to like some of her stuff. After she released Speak Now, I was hooked. She was getting away from the country twang and going to pop. Again, this was all good for me, but I know many country fans were not happy with it. Well, Red is here and it is awesome! Pop for sure, and I love how she has found a great sound for her voice.<br /><br />So far, I like every song for the most part. I was not a fan of We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together when it first came out (I thought it was Ke$ha at first!) but it has grown on me. I find myself singing it all the time.<br /><br />The whole album has a blunt, raw look at love and heartache. I like her edgy lyrics, and her willingness to mix up the songs this time. As much as I like her, I admit in the past that you could tell it was a Taylor Swift song within the first 3 notes of the song. You may not even know which one it was, but you would know it was her. I feel like she has stepped outside of her comfort zone with Red and is trying new things. Fortunately, with her catchy lyrics and fun outlook on life makes her a gem in any genre.<br /><br />Hope this helps! God Bless!!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was very excited to read this book, as I had read all of the Harry Potter books, after my kids finished them.  I only got to the middle of Chapter 4 before I went on to another book in my kindle.  So maybe, this is a partial review. I found it a bore and difficult to understand, not being British. ( Because their colloquial language  being so different from ours, in the USA, it made for difficult and slow reading . ) Otherwise, it just might be a good book.....  I just couldn't get into it.
B000002MNR|5.0|I love this collection from films Cal, Last Exit to Brooklyn, Princess Bride and Local Hero, and equally important - so does my wife. This is masterfully written and performed music with a poet's touch and mostly in collaboration with Guy Fletcher. Don't expect Sultans of Swing (which is on my top-ten list of all time)- it's emotional, well done and beautiful work.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it works well it tells you how much life you. have on the battery that you have left on it.
B005EVVESM|4.0|Love it ! This is just what I expected from Maroon5. Like every song. Bass was too high in my car for Moves Like Jagger and I thought I had a knock in my car, Funny, but true story !!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The book was actually good right up until the first sex scene. then garbage from there on out. I only made it about half way through and lost intrest.
B004UID2LC|3.0|When this app works its great!!!!You can download all the songs you want for free. But sometimes it doesn't work and you cant even watch videos let alone download them. Overall this app is just oka
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little shapener is the cats a...ahh, meow. It is especially good when you have a serrated edge knife. All of my OTFs are sharp again.  Robbie
B009CPES4I|3.0|We ordered this because we love this genre.We were disappointed with the screenplay/script which did not give the stellar cast the chance to shine. The movie committed the worst offense of all: It was BORING. I cannot recommend it.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time, and by far the best western books written.  You will not regret reading this, it is a truly great book!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|great game great sequel to another great game<br /><br />puzzle games rule and this is among the best<br /><br />definitely worth the money
1469984202|5.0|It has been refreshing to stumble upon a novel that is all consuming.  From start to finish, Hugh Howey's thoughtful storytelling paints a picture that is not only creatively distinct, but deeply moving.  A must read for those eager to experience fresh and engaging narrative.  WOOL secured me as a fan of Mr. Howey's entire body of work.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Here is a fact which to this day is strange<br />The original tomb was in constant need of repair and deteriorated significantly due to construction on unsuitable soil. In 1900, a complete reconstruction of Lincoln's tomb was undertaken, and the Lincolns' remains were exhumed, before Lincoln was finally placed back in the white marble sarcophagus that Mullen and Hughes had opened so easily in 1876.[8] In April 25, 1901, upon completion of the reconstruction, Robert Todd Lincoln visited the tomb. He was unhappy with the disposition of his father's remains and decided that it was necessary to build a permanent crypt for his father. Lincoln's coffin would be placed in a steel cage 10 feet (3.0 m) deep and encased in concrete in the floor of the tomb. On September 26, 1901, Lincoln's body was exhumed so that it could be re-interred in the newly built crypt. However, those present (a total of 23 people) feared that his body might have been stolen in the intervening years, so they decided to open the coffin and check.[10]<br /><br />[edit] Last viewing<br /><br />It was said that a harsh choking smell arose when the casket was opened. Lincoln was perfectly recognizable, even more than thirty years after his death. His face was a bronze color from the gunshot wound that shattered the bones in his face and damaged the tissue. The color was unhealed bruises. His hair, beard and mole were all perfectly preserved although his eyebrows were gone. His suit was covered with a yellow mold and his gloves had rotted on his hands. On his chest, they could see some bits of red fabric -- remnants of the American flag with which he was buried, which had by then disintegrated. It was theorized that Lincoln had been embalmed so many times on board his funeral train that he had been practically mummified
B00164CM46|5.0|Yup, best movie ever, and on Blu-ray, it gets even better! I think I paid 9 bucks for it, that was just frosting on the proverbial cake.  Robbie
B0006ZFQP8|5.0|Keliber's performance of Tristan und Isolde is one of even his greatest triumphs and one of the great recordings in all music.  Other reviewers have covered many aspects which I will not repeat save to express the opinion that Rene Kollo is satisfactory, but not really at the same level as the other principal performers (Kleiber, Price, and Fassbaender).  Fassbaender's \\"Habet Acht\\" is one of the highlights of this recording.<br /><br />What Kleiber achieves with this brilliant recording is to pace the whole Opera with his incredible sense of rhythm and \\"loudness\\" such that the final scenes (Der Liebestod and the following orchestral finale) truly represent the culmination and climax of this great Opera.  He really treats it as one 4 hour long tone poem - only he could have pulled that off.<br /><br />I imagine that Margaret Price must have been a little surprised when Kleiber wooed her to do Isolde for him - but what a choice, and what an absolutely incredible Liebestod.  If you are forced to sample just 2 minutes of this Opera, listen to the first two minutes of the Liebestod.  The whisper quiet beginning building up to the huge high note which is sung with tremendous volume and is, yet, quintessentially feminine.  One of the great moments in recorded music.<br /><br />Acquire this recording, set aside 4 hours, and listen to it without interruption.  You will not regret it.  (And don't cheat by listening to the Liebestod first!).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is an excellent follow-up to The Hunger Games; it's engaging with a definite measure intrigue; I can't wait to read part 3!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was a good book but i would still like to get some of ava's questions answered.i think gideon should answer her queations instead of dismissing them.
B009M8TA20|5.0|The greatest autobiograhpy i have read to date. I would recommend to anyone football fan or not. It's great reading
1933865407|5.0|This book is an excelent example of the art style many people seek out Buce Timm for. The book promises girls, it delivers girls. The poses are varied and cover many of the characters younger fans are likely to known his take on as well as original images that are great examples of how he demonstrates his line and color work within this style. It's not an instruction book, but it is a great art book.<br /><br />For anyone who's a fan of Bruce Timm or the various projects he's been a part of, I recommend this book.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Save your time and money.  Do not waste a second on this.  Story i s weak and the acting is awful.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|I was really late discovering this album. I heard Cee-Lo Green's \\"The Lady Killer\\" album last year and loved it, and then went looking for \\"St. Elsewhere\\" by Gnarls Barkley. It was out of stock at the shop where I usually buy my CDs (yes, I like to buy real discs, I'm not a downloader), so I waited ... and waited ... and finally got my hands on this jewel a few months ago. Very impressive album. As another reviewer admitted, I'm not a rap or hip-hop fan either. I can listen to some of that stuff, and like old-school rap artists from the 80s, but too many of the new breed leave me unimpressed if not annoyed. This, though, is more like a hybrid mix of musical styles, and it really works. I haven't heard much by Danger Mouse, other than the excellent collaboration he did with Sparkleshorse, so I can't compare this to his other work. But matching him with Cee-lo was a stroke of genius. Cee-lo's vocals are still top-notch. Really, he's got one of the strongest voices in music nowadays. But the true strength to this album is not the vocals or the production, but the songs themselves. \\"Crazy\\" is the obvious gem, but there are many other great tunes on here also, both instrementals and vocal tracks. Plus, I love their version of the Violent Femmes song \\"Gone Daddy Gone.\\" No matter which genre you want to file this music, it's brilliant stuff!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Wasn't sure Id like this book, and didnt really like most of volume 1, the characters grew on me and by the end of book 1 I had to start book 2 right away because I just had to know what happened next!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I  LOVE THIS BOOK IT IS AMAZING:) I couldn‘t put it down! I highly recommend reading it if you haven‘t already.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|It's so interesting to read about each of the characters from a totally different perspective than in the previous books. I change sympathies with each book about the Cousins War.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun game. I really enjoy this old game reminds me of the arcade. my kids really enjoy this game also.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read, wish I would have read it before the movie. Looking forward to the next book in November for loan.
6305428042|1.0|I received the movie and all of the physical features were in great shape. One night I tried to play it in our DVD player and it wouldn't work. I tried in other DVD players in my house along with computers and it just so happens that I was given a BLANK DISC. It had Hocus Pocus on the DVD it self and it had the Walt Disney print and everything. (It looks like an actual DVD) but there is nothing on it!
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I really liked this book! It has action, sci-fi, and romance. I highly recommend it and I just know it's going to be made into a movie one day. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to download the second in the trilogy.
B004ZN9R6G|5.0|Great album, I had it on LP, but loaned it to a friend, and we all know how that goes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I may have completed one or two reviews on my many many Amazon purchases. Since I am such a cheapskate, but ponied up the $2 for this book, I felt that I owed it to the author to say - Wow, that was damn good! - as at least some additional form of payment for this great work. I just could not believe that I had never heard of this author before when the story is so gripping and writing so tight. I see now that there are more books in the series and I doubt I will be able to resist the urge to buy them and learn more of this amazing world he has created.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Love this lego (for my kid). Just bought it and it looks great. He is five years old and was so happy with it!<br />Thanks!! also for the great price
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The package is worth the price for 2 reasons:<br />1) Excellent cover and inside artwork<br />2) Having the first 2 movies looking better than ever in HD, really great shape!!!<br /><br />I like the 3rd movie, but computer alien effects look cheap in HD, could have made a little effort on restoring them.<br />4th movie is just an add.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Like the book more than the movie. can't wait to start part 2. hope it's exciting as the 1st book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! All those people who gave bad reviews aren't right in the head. I have never had any problems and I always have fun playing Minecraft. THIS GAME ROCKS!!!
B00933JL0A|4.0|This is a great game that is rather addicting. DEFINITELY worth the download. I give it a 4 star only because it got boring after a while and you cant delete worlds when your finished with them. You have to build stuff with resources you gain. Eventually, you have a thriving community. If you like these kind of games, check out Minecraft Pocket Edition and Block Story Lite. Thanks for reading!<br />Brocktree13
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|This is the most watched tv show in the fall. If you haven't watched then you are missing out on what everyone is talking about. Well written script, great actors excitement and thrills abounds. If you like scary creepy charaters this show won't let you down. Hard to wait for the show to come on. I highly reccomend having this in your video library.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I won't go into a full-on review of this Album, others have done a much better job than I am capable.  I am simply a Music Lover with wide ranging tastes.  In my opinion, this is the Best Album of 2012.  I hope that in some way it can find audiences who simply aren't aware of the Coolest Man on The Planet and his Genius.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I didn't have the chance of seeing it on 3D in theaters, and didn't know until now what 3D can add to a cinematic experience, the depth is really amazing, specially the sequences after the main characters have \\"maited\\". Absolutely immersive!
B008G12ERC|5.0|LOVE IT! If you are a fan of Muse's ever evolving music compositions then 2nd Law will not disappoint. Enjoy!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Takes you back to high school and all the complicated relationships that are so important in defining who you are and how you define yourself.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|For fans of the graphic novel, a nice retelling though not as dark or with as much cultural satire. Can't wait for part 2.
B000SVZIDA|3.0|The DVD and online video were both as described and nothing wrong with the quality or shipping, I just didnt like the film.  I would describe it as very \\"artsy\\" and honestly...ridiculous. On the kind side, I'd call it a \\"spectacle\\" and leave it there.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Full of suspense (for teens), also a great story that pulls you in andmakes it hard to put the book down.
B0091REZMW|5.0|its really fun! gives u lots of energy! a fun challenging mystery game to play! kid friendly and awesome! love it!!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|We started with Tinkerbell 3 and thought it was very good.  My daughter (4) thought this was even better; a great story.  They seem to get better with each one they make.
1423140605|5.0|Unless you wish to spend an entire year waiting to know what happens next, you probably shouldn't get this book. Well, you should. Its a great book. Just wait another year. Since this is the third book in the series you probably want to read this book to know what happened since the last book. But seriously... this cliffhanger... way worse than book two. I don't think I needed to mention any spoilers because Rick Riordan almost always has a cliffhangers in the middle of his series.<br />That being said, I still love this book and series. I'm addicted. (but that almost makes it worse after reading this book and having to wait another year.<br /><br />Involving the books physical condition it was perfect.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|this app was great when i first downloaded it, now it's not worth anything. can only see about 10 statuses. just opened it one day and it stopped working. kindle fire hd.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the Bible of course but when I try to sign onto the group I get an error message telling me to try again later.  I have tried many times.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|i'm not one for long reviews so this'll be sort and to the point.  Stone Sour's latest offering is an amazing musically piece that has kept me entertained for a few days now.  It has a perfect balance of pure metal and nice acoustic pieces that will satisfy any fan of real music.  I highly recommend this record and you're honestly doing yourself a disservice by not listening to this.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|Rock of Ages is one of the best movies to be released this year and I love the music in the movies and it was a reminder of 80s hair metal.  Poison, Scorpions and Quarterflash are some of the artists featured in the movie.  Great music and one of the years' underrated movies.
B0099G3I96|5.0|Can't say much about this album. I haven't listened to it much, I really like No Doubt but just can't listen to the full album.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  Honestly, I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this after reading Bared to You.  While I enjoyed the first book in the Crossfire series, I didn't feel that Gideon's character or the relationship were very well developed. In fact, I found Gideon to be a little creepy at times in the first book (recreating her bedroom?; wearing matching PJ pants? - ewe!) And then the fact they discussed couples counseling after, what, a week of sleeping together?  That being said, not only did book 2, Reflected in You, blow away the first book it actually made me want to re-read the first book again because I just couldn't get enough of Eva & Gideon.  Reflected in You was fast paced, sensual, passionate, sometimes heart wrenching, and all together exciting.  Gideon's character comes to life in this book and I loved that even though there were plenty of hot sexy scenes, some of the most passionate scenes involved nothing more than a kiss:>  The supporting characters were also very well developed.  Enough to feel like you know and understand them, but not so much detail that they distracted from the real story.  Great book!  Anxiously waiting for book three, Entwined with You, to come out.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|The is fun to play at first. But then it speeds up and you need more help to run the cafe. Well, you have to pay real money to get new help. I do not like that part. Why not make it so you earn new help or can use the \\"money\\" you make running the cafe. I am  not paying real money to buy fake money.
0007275528|5.0|This hard cover book is beautiful, filled with many illustrations plus lots of instruction for colored pencils (or just drawing).  The photos are large enough so details are easily seen.
1449410243|5.0|A peek into your cat's psyche! I recognized the behavior and now I am prepared for the worst. Highly recommended reading.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Titanic is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I have seen this movie 10 times in theaters and I have seen this movie about four times at home.  James Cameron delivers a classic and one of the best films of all-time. I love the story in the movie.  The class distinction.  How could they miss the iceberg in the movie?  They should have seen the iceberg coming.  The special effects are amazing and a groundbreaking film and the one of only three movies to win 11 Oscars.<br /><br />I love Titanic and it is a classic movie.<br />A MUST SEE FILM.
B0028INIWE|5.0|The Very Best of the Grateful Dead captures 17 of their best songs written.  They've digitally re-mastered this album and it sounds extraordinary. It is amazing to listen to without any pops or hisses.  I would recommend this album to any Dead-Head out there!!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Great follow up to the first book in the trilogy. Great story line - couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the last book in the trilogy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is amazing it is so cool I spent an hour playing it at night and I loved it!!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|cool game<br />keeps me busy way too late to the night. picked it up as app often day. worth the five dollars no ads
0399157565|5.0|I've read everything Patricia Cornwell has written.  And I have thoroughly enjoyed every book.  The Bone Bed is no exception.  Hooked from start to finish.  Well done, Kay (oops, Patricia)!
B000SEGHT6|5.0|Darkly humourous commentary on war and mass killing from one of the best American writer's of the 20th century.  Unfortunately he has passed on.  So it goes.
1451696191|5.0|Chbosky writes so well that you do not quite understand how it is that Charlie is just a fictional character. Maybe it's because we're all Charlie. This book is addictive, whether it identifies you, amaze you or excites you. Young adult literature, of unparalleled quality.
B005GSY23M|1.0|It has two good songs on it.  The rest is just the score.  I like the score but would not have paid that much for it.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I guess I'm one of those people in the minority who really didn't like this book. I was hesitant to buy this book for the longest time, but finally all the positive reviews and book suggestions from Amazon convinced me to take the plunge. Bad mistake.  Both main characters were so unlikeable! Travis has serious anger and insecurity issues that only a therapist (or several therapists!) can cure.  Abby is your typical co-dependent partner who is in denial. No matter how many times she thinks of breaking up with Travis, all he has to do is say the word and she's right back where she started! I was getting so frustrated by it! Of course, the only voice of reason came from other characters, whose opinions were ignored! I kept trying to root for Abby to make the right choice, but it never happens! She is so co-dependent of Travis! I picture years of therapy for her and her future children if she stays with Travis. Or in a home for abused women and children. I'm trying to find the appeal with Travis. In the beginning of the book he seemed really likeable, but I got so scared at his violent behavior! He trashed his apartment when Abby wasn't there when he woke up. Then he got kicked out of class when he overturned two desks when Abby didn't show up! Not to mention his hair trigger jealousy when a guy so much breathes next to Abby! I can understand bad boy appeal, but if someone acts this way they really should get some help or end up in jail! But I guess that is the genius of this book. It brings out so many powerful emotions in its reader that it's hard not to talk about it!
B00913DPW2|1.0|Not interesting at all.  Got boring after about five minutes.  Graphics weren't bad.  Deleted game within an hour of buying it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|fun if you like the bejeweled style game...story seems to engage my 7 yo more than me but doesnt take away from game play.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|my son is 6 &amp; I'm 35 &amp; we both love this app. so addictive &amp; fun. we love the gadgets too. have not spent one cent which is great too!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I have been waiting for this new movie for a year now and I am so pleased with it.  Once again the content is clean and I feel great about letting my little ones watch it.  There are a few minor attitudes and disregard to authority figures but these are minor compared to most disney movies out there.  Lighthearted movie!  I really like the original movie and the 3rd great fairy rescue.  The second one isn't my favorite.  This fourth one again is fun and enjoyable to watch!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it's like being a kid again. When the coin or prize is on the edge I find myself shaking my kindle trying to get them to fall or turnig it to try and keep them from falling in the gutter. Love It
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book , kept me on my toes from book 1 til the last page. definitely recommended . perfection
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Very enjoyable and touching story ,my first time with Mitch Albom and probably won't be my last. Looking forward to his next novel .
B007THA4FI|5.0|I enjoyed Miss Rowling's first steps into adulthood. I am a fan of her other books. I felt she hit the mark on this story of English (British ) life having lived in a setting as described it brought back memories. The characters are all to be found in live either here in the USA or in the UK. The haves the have nots and those in between and of course those who want to rule. It has its funny side in a black way and of course tragedy.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book is well written and very easy to read.  You will remember and contemplate its greater ideas long after the book has been completed.
0062082353|5.0|Great story about an true american warrior and family man,book is easy to read,hard to put down.If you want a book that shows you what its like to be a Navy Seal this it.
B004X2M3N8|2.0|By far the weakest season of the show.<br />It gets absolutely ridiculous and there are a number of episodes that are nothing short of unwatchable.<br />Just an absolute debacle.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I only get about 20 posts before it quits loading. They are all blue with no pictures and you cant even open them. This needs some seroius work.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am enjoying this awesome and classic game of solitaire. Now if only I could win more often : )
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun. You can play it an let time go by so fast. Get it if you get the chance too.

B000055Y12|5.0|This was a used DVD but the condition is excellent.  No scratches.  Plays beautifully. This movie is one of Hitchcock's best movies although I always regret seeing Hitchcock make his cameo appearances - it's so corny.  But the movie is fast-moving and very well done.

0061438294|3.0|The book is great when it stays in the realm of decipering body language. I found the main themes of freeze/flight/flight mechanisms, self-pacification, feet first then proceed up, focus on comfort/discomfort, and deviation from a baseline to be very compelling. Most of the info is backed by research and studies and the author gives nice explanations on how most of these behaviors can be explained from an evolutionary point of view, always a good thing in my opinion.<br /><br />The book starts to lose touch though when the author starts sidelining into manners and how we as individuals should act in society. For example, I don't need the author saying \\"if you are trying to influence others in a positive way, you should conceal [tattoos]\\" (p. 130). That may be true but I think it's way off topic from deciphering body language.<br /><br />Also, the writing style and humor of the book is kind of bland for my tastes.<br /><br />So overall I would say if you're looking for an intro book on body language and can glance over the \\"this is how you should act\\" talk and the boring writing style, get this book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was very interesting. It kept me on the edge the whole time I was reading it. I would suggest this book to anyone.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I finally put the book down after reading about 52%.  Unlike book one it just did not hold my attention.  I assume it could be that I am aware of the politics of that era and found it boring to review in such detail.  As mentioned I found book one so interesting.  Sorry Mr. Follett.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I won't give anything away but as much as most of the book(s) are pure drivel yet books you can't put down, the third installment surprised me at the end and made me change my opinion of the entire series. That's all I'll say and for those of you who have already read it, agreed?
B000JML90Y|2.0|everybody should already be very familiar with the focus of this book.  It is an excellent read if you are into science
