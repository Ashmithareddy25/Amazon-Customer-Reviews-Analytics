B00AFEX83C|4.0|I brought this movie for my granddaughters who were visiting for 2 weeks.  We watched the night before I took them to see Monster Universe, Inc.  It was a first for me and a second time for my granddaughters.  We all enjoyed it.  I would recommend this to any child.  The monsters are not frightening, but more comical in nature.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|A lot of great actors in this movie - I was really impressed with the settings, how they were able to recreate the era of the late 1940's.  It has the same appeal as &#34;LA Confidential&#34;.  Highly recommended for watching!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I. LOVED. IT!!!<br /><br />Mind you, I am not the &#34;target audience&#34; of this book, or perhaps the original target bc it has really taken off. In any event, I could not get enough of it and it was hard to out down when I had to go to sleep to wake up in time for work!! A great read and a wonderful story !
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Purchased this for my daugher for Christmas.  Awesome!  She was thrilled as so was I.  I'm sorry I didn't purchase one for myself!
B00973DDN2|5.0|I'm not sure what else people expected out of this... Not only did the Killers stay true to themselves, but they grew as a band lyrically and musically. Fantastic album, from beginning to end. This isn't a long review because there really is nothing else to say. If you're still trying to compare things to hot fuss, you're a fool. That was over a decade ago, get over it. The band grew up, and so should you.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Would have rated this higher if the story line was better but it is 95% literary porn. Plus it's kind of hard to believe a 21 year old innocent virgin dive right into this. I have to say I'm going to read the next two books just to find out Christian's story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show! The characters are so relatable. But I was not prepared for the plot twists this season. What will they do with the next?
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|love this show wish was stil on .it is a show you can watch over and over they need to put it back on
0894803123|5.0|Very good recipes.  I especially like the strawberry ice cream recipe.  All recipes use a 1 & 1/2 quart ice cream maker.  I bought a Cuisinart ICE-RFB 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Freezer just for this recipe book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game, like the movies, is really hilarious and fun. I love the goals. I love the outside and El Macho levels. Don't quite understand where Meena comes in... I wish they'd add a birthday party scene and amusement park. Certainly worth playing and FREE to boot!
B007N85POS|4.0|I will try the game I had it before and my kids loved it. so I am going to try it.

B0036G1T78|5.0|They just don't write thrillers like this anymore. Very faced paced and twists every where. You will enjoy this. Love the scanner at the opening.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My only suggestion would be don't &#34;binge&#34; on watching the walking dead! lol.....My daughter and son in law were trying to get me to watch this show for about a year and 1/2. Watched a few episodes with them and by season 1, episode 9, there was no turning back! :P I can't wait for Season 4 to start on October 13th..............Ironically, my daughter and two of my granddaughters birthdays and my daughter is having a &#34;Walking Dead&#34; theme party! lol
B005CRQ4OW|2.0|Well there is nothing really to say about this one. Meh. Not my cup of tea, definitely not for me.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I have a kindle fire HD and tried to put this game to the kindle fire HD and it wont take it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|However, this is a large game and it uses a lot of memory but it is a very fun game. Basicly you guide your shark around the dark depths and eat everything in sight, the more you eat the bigger you get. Get your current shark to level 10 you unlock the next shark but save your coins as you go the sharks get expensive. Decent controls and the graphics are pretty good.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I always felt bad about being an introvert. Now i see how important introverts are to society. It also has helped me to understand my needs better and be more accepting of who I am. This book is a definite must for all introverts and those extroverts trying to understand them. A great read to help you in the workplace and in relationships.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|An easy, short read about an unexpected relationship. Left me feeling pained, heartbroken, and happy all at the same time. Definitely recommended!
B002CNST10|1.0|Muse has to be one of the most over-rated bands in musical history.  Lyrics are banal.  The lead vocals are so over the top it is laughable.<br />So pretentious.  Marginal talent.<br />Everything is so overblown and pompous.<br />Absolution, Origin of Symmetry ... just burn all this trash.  They will be viewed as a pimple on the rump of music years from now and nobody will listen to this tripe.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Well, it's a Die Hard movie, so it actually is entertaining.  However, the other &#34;Die Hards&#34; are definitely better, and if you don't want to complete the series in your shelf, you'll probably be happier renting this one on Amazon Prime or Netflix.
B00BAYLQI0|1.0|I'm truly stunned at all the 4- and 5-star reviews.  This was one turgid cinematic experience.  The actual tsunami scenes were wrenching and terrifying, but they only occupy about 5 minutes. The rest of the movie is filled with awful dialogue, crappy<br />acting by everyone, and relentless \\"heart-wrenching\\" or \\"heart-warming\\" scenes, all completely unconvincing, and fueled by a noxious, manipulative soundtrack.  It was like a really lame TV movie, just without the car commercials, which would have<br />been much more entertaining.<br />Apparently this is based on a true story. I'd be curious as to how much of the real story was incorporated, because, for instance, it is truly unbelievable that (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!) the two youngest sons could survive that brutal onslaught of water by<br />clinging to trees.<br />Anyway, the whole film is so unconvincing, it is pointless to single out any particular moment.  That's 2 hours I'll never get back.  Darn.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|This is by far the most awesomest music documentary that I have ever watched. I regret not having purchased it earlier. The video and audio quality is superb. The pace at which the documentary moves is also perfect. If Dave had included extra/deleted stuff, then this bluray would have deserved 6 stars.
0756404746|5.0|I love this book. I just re-read it last week and I couldn't put it down. It's beautifully written. I really hope the third book is finished soon.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I liked the comparison between the German and the American pilot.  I liked the integrity and humanity that was shown. And that it was true.  I like learning more about how the war affected all those involved in the war especially the German people.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|I got this app so I could see videos on my Kindle and it did work for my situation.  I still have to adapt to the application because I am use to seeing face book in a different format.  I would recommend this app if you are having problems viewing videos sent to you on a Kindle device.

B00DP3IESY|5.0|If you enjoy superb action, production, sound, acting and sheer quality film...you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />I really enjoyed Tron Legacy and Joseph Kosinski did a fantastic follow up job with Oblivion. Truly a director that I will look forward to seeing what he can do in the future!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the twists and turns. What a page turner. I'll have to check out her other books. I recommend it for sure.
0345529057|4.0|My husband watches The Game of Thrones, so I bought these for him. He enjoyed reading them, as with anything there was a lot more info in the books. Would definitely buy from seller again, received books sooner than expected as well. Now he's waiting for the other 3 books to come out.
B0058W74UY|2.0|I downloaded this app to allow me to view facebook videos on my Kindle.  Perhaps it was the incorrect way to go because it did not work.  However I did download the face book app that solved my problems.  I can now view the videos.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Amazing; this book has changed how I face tasks, approach leadership, and accept that being a woman in authority doesn't mean I have to emulate male behaviors to be good at what I do. Whenever I face a difficulty and want to take a step back, I tell myself, \\"Lean in!\\"

B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I loved this movie, but it was a bit difficult to believe this movie takes place before the Wizard of Oz. That is my only complaint it was just difficult for me not think about throughout the movie which kind of killed parts for me.
B00969PR18|2.0|If you are used to real mapping software this app falls woefully short. Two stars only because it does work albeit poorly.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|This app is good especially when the default is another page and you are more accustomed to Google search.  I am still in the learning phase of the different apps on the Google page, Instead of he picture of an app I think I would prefer a word reference.  I would recommend this to anyone who prefers to use Google as a search engine.
B007XNTDPA|3.0|This is certainly not Grisham's best novel.<br />Interesting but not riveting, I found the characters to be shallow and formulaic.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I would get this game if I were you.  Thugs game is Awesome!  It's a nice challenge.  Makes hour brain work a little.
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|One of the most interesting books I have read.  Goes deep and wide on 2 very different eras, and the people that defined them, in the design and construction of spy planes.

B00COGY2P2|5.0|I was surprised to like this movie that much. I'm not a Tom Cruise fan at all, so I was not expecting to like it. But the movie is actually well done and there is some humor to it. I was a good Friday night movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really fun just like temple run. you can change its outfit and there's 3 different levels to try.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book. It makes you feel like your really living in the book ,and you could feel every experience as you read the book. AMAZING characters they just show you the perks of being a wallflower
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|What a story, what a role for Hugh Jackman. I felt a great pride for the artists, and the scenery. If you love music, you will love this film . buy and put it in your collection, no regrets. Remember this is a story of everyday people of their times and not Opera stars performing on stage.  Russel Crowe also did well too. Thankyou all.
0739375970|3.0|I have a friend, and since I had some extra money that particular week, I bought it for her. She is a big fan of the writer and she was thrilled to recieve it!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I really enjoy the prose the style Bram Stoker put into this work.  The sense of foreboding, and sinister nature of the villain lacks the &#34;cheesy-ness&#34; of the film adaptations.  I worked on a theatrical version of this story in College, created the sound track for it.  More than any film or theatrical interpretation, THIS is a classic.  I don't think the screen could ever do justice to this work.  The use of perspective via the journals and letters gives a feeling of reading over a tragical history of the characters right from the off.  While I have yet to quite finish, it is proving a wonderful read.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I love true stories and this shows how a dog can bond with an owner the only thing they want is to be loved and cared for and they will do the same for you

B003Z0BWR2|3.0|I must admit I'm somewhat disappointed. I loved the first book, City of Bones, so much, hubby got me the entire series for Christmas last year. Unfortunately, the second book wasn't nearly as exciting or captivating as the first. I struggled through most of it as it just didn't hold my interest long enough and I constantly had to put it down and do/read something else. On the bright side, the writing is still the top quality I'm used to getting from Clare, and I was especially impressed with the different types of demons she created. I might still read the rest of the series, instead of letting it gather dust on my bookshelf.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is a film about 1865 and well as a film about today. The costumes are different but the conflicts and the people are right<br />from today's headlines.

B000KADH2S|5.0|This book changes the attitude of person and makes it positive. It prepares a person for more responsibility and more success. Man can easily take the charge of his life after controlling his brain and this book teaches that. I am very happy to find this book.
1451695195|1.0|I read Dr. Eben's book and I was quite excited about what he wrote, but it was a little inconsistent with other experiences.  But since he is/was a neurosurgeon, I was more willing to be less critical. Fortunately, over a few month after reading his book, I have read of reporters and investigators looking up his background to verify his story.  What he says in the book are either lies or exaggerations.  For example, he talks about how he went into a coma due to his bacterial meningitis.  A investigator went and found the attending ER doctor that was treating Dr. Eben to confirm his story, but she said she put him in a \\"medically induced coma\\" because he was being hysterical and we couldn't treat him. This is very different from what he said in his book.<br /><br />If you look at his professional history, he actually lost a couple of jobs due to blatant medical malpractice. He did a spinal surgery on a patient and fused the wrong bones, but decided not to tell his patient about it until the guilt was too much.<br /><br />I wish Dr. Eben well, and hope he finds salvation,  but shame on him for exaggerating and lying about his NDE.  Spiritual matters are too important to commit such fraud, there's hell to pay for blatant lies like this. He should come clean before it's too late and explain what really happened.

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I bought this on a whim, being a long time admirer and thinking, \\"how bad could it possibly be.\\" I was blown out. I admire Tony Iommi big time, and after battling cancer for so long -- to come back and throw this stuff down -- it just made me cherish the music more. The crushing guitar riffs are not for everyone. But for me ... it's like a reaffirmation of life. After listening to \\"Damaged Soul,\\" I did one of those -- you know, (expletive) YEAH! while driving down the highway. This is my favorite cut. It is as dark and moody as it gets and you hear that trademark metal on metal sound of the riff master ramming what sounds like a metal pick onto the strings. This guy just never ceases to amaze - through all of early Sabbath, to his work with Dio and Glen Hughes -- he just keeps coming up with some of the heaviest licks you will hear in your lifetime. This ones for Tony.

B00ANDDBBE|5.0|After Martha Jones leaves him because of her unresolved feelings, the Doctor is once again alone and off to go on more adventures and find another companion to travel through time and space with him. In the peak of Russell T. Davies' run on Doctor Who, the Doctor will travel to the planet of the Ood, face the shadows in a library, and face an old foe once again, with the help of the Runaway Bride, Donna Noble. Series 4 of Doctor Who contains everything that made the revived show great and makes it so much better. The acting, the sharp writing and wit, the horror, the phenomenal characterization, and even a haunting and exciting soundtrack, all of it is phenomenal and on its A-game in this season.<br /><br />After reuniting with the Doctor, Donna Noble gets her chance to travel with the Doctor to countless times and worlds. Her inclusion as a companion is fantastic, and those who may have worried that her obnoxious personality from The Runaway Bride might make her annoying in comparison to Rose Tyler and Martha Jones have no reason to be worried. Sure, Donna is still loud-mouthed and sassy, but her character's quirks don't grow old or annoying, and in fact are a large part of why she is such a fun companion. Her sassy attitude and thankful lack of affection for the Doctor create a new dynamic to the duo, one that is refreshing after three seasons of companions swooning over their traveling hero. Beyond this obnoxious attitude is a deeper characterization, though, a character who feels inadequate (\\"I'm just a temp from Chiswick\\"), and Donna's arc over the course of the season crafts her into one of the best and most memorable characters on the show yet.<br /><br />Donna is not the only memorable part of this season, however. Doctor Who is known for its stellar characters and this series does not disappoint. Donna, River Song, Wilfred Mott, Martha (who makes several great guest appearances), and so many more characters shine and bring life to the show. All of these characters are rounded out by some great acting from the cast. David Tennant still shines and it is hard to deny the impact his portrayal of the Doctor has had on the franchise, while Catherine Tate provides the gamut of emotion and mood for Donna and provides great chemistry with Tennant. Georgia Moffat, Alex Kingston, Freema Agyeman, Fanella Woolgar, Lesley Sharp, Bernard Cribbins, and several more bring life to their characters in ways that enhance the engrossing nature of the show. Plenty of guest stars appear over the course of the season in a variety of circumstances, and none disappoint.<br /><br />This season also contains some of the series' darkest and yet best episodes. \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\", \\"Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead\\", \\"Midnight\\", \\"The Stolen Earth/Journey's End\\" are some of the best episodes in the series. \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\" gives a whole new dynamic to the character and provides a reflection of himself in ways his companions and villains can't provide. \\"Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead\\" proves a thrilling horror story, in many ways outing \\"Blink\\" as the scariest episode to that point, while also providing an excellent bridge between Davies' era and Steven Moffat's when he would take over the series the following season. \\"Midnight\\" provides another thrilling and scary low-budget episode that also provides some of the best deconstructions and most realistic looks at the series' lead, while also highlighting some of the best acting the series ever had. The three-part finale (or two-part, depending on if you count \\"Turn Left\\") gives a stellar, character-driven conclusion to not only the season, but the last four seasons as well.<br /><br />The production of the show continues to contribute to the show's engaging tales. The various effects provide for some truly intimidating villains and the soundtrack enhances the emotional moments even further. Moments where impossible things happen are believable due to the great effects andset-pieces the show provides. Even when production is low, it can sometimes prove for the greatest effects (the minimalistic nature of \\"Silence in the Library\\" and \\"Midnight\\" are what make these episodes so thrilling).<br /><br />All in all, series 4 truly surpasses the already great three seasons that preceded it. Everything great about the show is on here, providing for a truly engaging and emotional experience and proving that Doctor Who is a franchise not to be underestimated.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|The extra dvds were brilliant. What a great set and better in blue ray. Choice for anyones  sci fi collection.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|To help with the transition as the show would shift majorly in production teams, Russell T. Davies took Doctor Who off for a year. Instead of releasing a regular, thirteen episode season, four specials were aired instead over the course of a year. These followed various journeys of the Doctor after he left Donna, unable to have another companion due to the emotional pain of removing her memory. Meanwhile, just as in the regular seasons, a bit of a myth arc occurs when a mysterious prophecy is given to the Doctor: \\"it is returning\\" and \\"he will knock four times\\" are threads that weave through the specials, leading to David Tennant's swan song, \\"The End of Time.\\"<br /><br />As a complete package, the Specials are all worthy additions to Doctor Who. Each one stands on its own as a worthy episode of television, and as a whole, they provide David Tennant some valuable chances to stretch his skills and flesh out the Tenth Doctor before his inevitable regeneration into the Eleventh Doctor. For the purposes of this review, however, each special will be looked at individually, rather than as a collection, because they all stand on their own, despite the small thread tying them together.<br /><br />The first of these, the Christmas special of 2008, is \\"The Next Doctor.\\" The Doctor travels to Christmas Eve, 1851, in London, where he runs into a man who calls himself the Doctor (David Morrissey) as well, while traveling with what appears to be a companion named Rosita (Valile Tshabalala), who is in pursuit of the Cybermen. Believing he has found his next reincarnation, the Doctor tags along to find clues as to if this really is his next incarnation, or someone with a serious identity issue.<br /><br />\\"The Next Doctor\\" is an excellent special. Morrissey shines as this \\"Doctor\\", and although he would inevitably turn out to not be the next incarnation, he still could easily have turned out that way. He exudes all the right personality for the Doctor, and Rosita's character workswell as a possible companion (although her similarities to all of the Doctor's three female companions is not missed, either). Seeing the Doctor work with him is a delight to watch, as well. Although this \\"Doctor's\\" story is a bittersweet one, it still provides for an overall fun and enjoyable special.<br /><br />The second to come is \\"Planet of the Dead\\". In this Easter special, the Doctor boards a bus only to find it drive right through a wormhole and end up on another planet, one that appears to be covered in sand. One of the fellow passengers is Christina (Michelle Ryan), a charismatic and skilled thief who wound up on the bus running away from the cops. She joins forces with the Doctor as a temporary companion in hopes to find a way back through the wormhole and safe from this planet, where something slowly approaches the stranded passengers.<br /><br />Ryan is an absolute delight as Christina. Her character is spunky, skilled, adventurous, and even sexy. She has all the right traits to make her an interesting companion for the Doctor, albeit a temporary one. It would have been great to see her character become an actual companion, her chemistry with Tennant is that high. Her character alone makes \\"Planet of the Dead\\", although that isn't all the special has going for it. The plot is interesting, and the plot twist of what the planet and the swarm are come as quite a shock and make the story that much more interesting. Just as with the regular episodes, the human element also makes this special engaging. The passengers of the 200 bus all work together and form a very likeable cast, whose ultimate triumph is that much more powerful because of their likeability. Overall, this is an enjoyable special, and one that shouldn't be missed (note: this special does not actually exist on Netflix, which is where a lot of people watch the show; you will have to rent or purchase the DVD to see it if viewing the show by Netflix).<br /><br />The third special, and the best, is\\"The Waters of Mars\\". The Doctor finds himself on Mars in the year 2059, on November 21st. He investigates a nearby base to find a crew working there, studying the planet for a possibility of habitation by humans. The crew is led by Adelaide Brooke (Lindsay Duncan), a strong leader and inspired woman. However, the Doctor has heard of the crew before, who are all set to die on the very day he arrives. The Doctor stays to investigate what the cause of their death is, which appears to be a strange virus found in the water.<br /><br />\\"The Waters of Mars\\" stands as best of the specials for several reasons. The plot is strongly thematic, providing a great moral quandary for the Doctor: he knows these people are going to die, and he has to make the hard decision to let them die, even as he gets closer to these people and begins to see their deaths occur. The viewers' knowledge of the events to come provides a sense of foreboding over the entire special, one that tunes us in with the heartbreak the Doctor goes through as he waits for the inevitable. This also creates some of the most memorable moments for the Doctor as he makes the decisions he feels he needs to, and a moment near the end truly affects his character (if only this occurred sooner, and we could see the impact it had). This is complimented by one of Tennant's best performances as the Doctor, and Duncan rounds out the superb acting as Adelaide Brooke. Every crew member is also likeable and relatable, making their demises all the more heartbreaking when they occur. On top of that, the antagonist of this special, the virus in the water, is a scary threat that haunts throughout the episode. \\"The Waters of Mars\\" truly stands at the top of the list for Doctor Who episodes.<br /><br />Lastly comes \\"The End of Time\\", a two-part special that aired during the Christmas and New Years season. This special provides a good-bye to the Tenth Doctor as well as Russell T. Davies, who would retire from the show and hand it over to Steven Moffat. The Master (John Simm) is back from the dead, but something has gone wrong. He is not the same he once was, now a mad man (or at least, more so than he was) who has lost much of his sanity and still clings to the sound of drums that has infected him since childhood. The Doctor discovers that he is back, and that something else is returning. After realizing that his fate is still bound to Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins), the grandfather of Donna, he works with Wilfred to put a stop to any possible plans of the Master, and soon discovers what is returning.<br /><br />\\"The End of Time\\" is not a bad special by any means. In fact, it provides more great characterization to the Master as well as his relationship to the Doctor. Not to mention, the Tenth Doctor's death and regeneration into his eleventh incarnation is still a powerful experience and an emotional one. The major problem with \\"The End of Time\\" lies with its somewhat underwhelming and disappointing nature. It doesn't feel quite like the fitting conclusion to four seasons of Russell T. Davies' revived series or to the three seasons of David Tennant's portrayal of the Tenth Doctor. \\"Journey's End\\", with it's great character developments, huge cast of characters brought back (every companion from the first four revived seasons as well as Torchwood and Sarah Jane Adventures cast), and epic storyline felt like a definite conclusion to an era in ways \\"The End of Time\\" just doesn't. The Master and the \\"returning\\" antagonists feel somewhat under-utilized and just lack the impact that was expected for the finale. That's not to say they aren't a big reveal (because they are), but they just don't feel as engaging or powerful as hoped. They wind up just feeling underwhelming in nature and don't really impact the story that much (they pop up, some exposition goes down, and they just disappear). The problem really lies in the format. \\"Journey's End\\" focused on the companions, and \\"The End of Time\\" focuseson the Doctor and his past, which is intended to stay mysterious and unknown.<br /><br />However, \\"The End of Time\\" still has its strengths. What it does provide for antagonists are still well-developed and interesting. Simm's portrayal of the Master gone mad is chilling in many ways, and his character has some great scenes during the special. The ultimate antagonists are fairly threatening as well and provide some great fleshing out of the Doctor's past actions and his ultimate pacifism, partially through their own militancy. The only villains that are really bad are Joshua Naismith and Abigail Naismith. This father and daughter duo don't amount to much, especially when hyped to be important, and their motivations are really not that interesting, or even fleshed out. They mostly act as human McGuffins: they get the action moving then just sit there for the rest of the special. Wilfred Mott, however, is just as great as he was during the regular season. His character is fun, likeable, and gets fleshed out more in the special, providing some nice and new knowledge for his character. His inclusion as a companion is a nice one. However, the inevitable return of Donna due to his inclusion is also somewhat underwhelming and disappointing. Her character doesn't really fulfill on anything promised, and gets some really awkward inclusion into the special.<br /><br />However, of special note, is \\"The End of Time\\"'s stellar production. Many effects go into play in this special, all benefiting it. The skeleton that we keep seeing of the Master is as scary as it's meant to be, and his new found powers are well implemented. Several of the set pieces, especially those in Part 2, are beautiful to see and a wonder to marvel at. \\"The End of Time's\\" soundtrack is phenomenal as well, mixing in the sound of drums to great effect in many places and bring some much needed energy to a slightly disappointing special.<br /><br />Overall, the 2009 Specials are a nice package. There are several great moments scattered throughout, and not one episode is bad, even if the most important special is somewhat disappointing. For a Doctor Who fan, though, these are an important part of the collection, as these specials are an integral part of the series, providing a few last adventures for the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, and a few last moments for the brilliance of Russell T. Davies and his helming of Doctor Who to shine.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Honestly, I love my ipad but the more I use SwiftKey, the more I get frustrated with ios for not having something like this. SwiftKey was great even without the swype like functionality but with flow, it's the best thing ever on Android. Keyboard is the most used piece of software on phone and if the experience is as good as SwiftKey, you would want to just type. I type lengthy notes with SwiftKey and totally feel good about it. Want to do more. Can't wait to get my android tablet now. If SwiftKey could provide backup of my settings(my words and  phrases) then can switch phones more easily.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|Series 5 of Doctor Who can be described as sort of a \\"reset\\" of the series, one that inevitably comes with a show where the main character can regenerate an umpteen number of times, bringing in a new face and personality with each one. However, unlike with the first regeneration in the revived series of Doctor Who, this change in Doctors also came with a complete change in cast and crew. The head writer and producer, Russell T. Davies, handed over his position to the equally brilliant Steven Moffat (known for many fan favorites of the series, such as \\"The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances\\", \\"Blink\\", and \\"Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead\\"), and many other crew members shifted in positions. Combined with an overhauled cast (the only character from the previous seasons set to return was River Song, herself a Steven Moffat-written character) and a reworked style, this is a whole new season of Doctor Who in many ways. Except one, of course: despite all of the changes, Doctor Who didn't lose any of its charm, style, and brilliance in this transition.<br /><br />After regenerating into his eleventh incarnation at the end of \\"The End of Time\\", Matt Smith has taken over the role of the Doctor from David Tennant. Just as Tennant was a different yet very much the same Doctor in comparison to Christopher Eccleston, Matt Smith shares many similarities and differences with his predecessor, giving consistency to his character while also making him fresh again (a major reason why regeneration is always a good thing). Smith's Doctor has just the right amount of brilliance, mystery, charm, and darkness in him to ensure that he lives up to his role beautifully. In fact, Smith's kookier and angrier Doctor is a delight to watch just like the actors before him. His new companion, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), also shares the right similarities and differences with the companions that came before her. Like Martha Jones or Rose Tyler, Amy Pond is adventurous, brave, and a strong-willed young woman, qualities that make her an excellent companion. Moments like the forest scene in \\"Flesh and Stone\\" prove that she can hold her own and that she is a strong character. However, her flirtatious personality gives her something unique in comparison to her predecessors, and although it may seem like it would become unlikeable at first, it is handled with care and brilliance, and never does Amy truly become an unlikeable character. In fact, her romance over the course of this season with Rory Williams is consistently realistic, believable, and charming. It has its faults in moments, especially midway through the season, but the show's writers keep it from becoming cheap drama and instead build a romance that makes sense and never angers the viewers, and their decision to keep the two together, rather than give Amy a romance with the Doctor, is one that will make many fans happy. The last two mainstays of the season, Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) and River Song (Alex Kingston) (who was previously introduced in series four in a very interesting and totally Doctor Who way), both are just as well developed and interesting as the rest of the cast, and they also stand out as strong, likeable characters. River especially has just the right amount of mystery and understanding surrounding her character, as more about her relationship with the Doctor and who she is are revealed this season.<br /><br />As previously implied, the writing in this series stays consistently brilliant and doesn't falter in the transition. Many of the episodes in this season are great. With standouts like the creepy \\"The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone\\", the wonderful \\"Amy's Choice\\", the thematic \\"The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood\\", the fun and great \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\", and lastly, the intense and epic finale \\"The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang\\", this season remains just as enjoyable as the previous four. This season's myth arc, dealing with the \\"cracks in time\\", takes a departure from the villain-centric myth arcs of past seasons, a nice move that compliments the season well, giving a new way of telling the over-arching narrative that pays off well in the season finale. Not to mention, it is just as intriguing as those of the past. Like \\"Bad Wolf\\" or \\"the stars are going out\\", it carries a constant and mysterious presence throughout the season that keeps the viewer interested and reveals itself in just the right portions, with some really excellent and mind blowing clues given. The show doesn't lose any of its humor, either, as the new Doctor's kooky-ness or the banter between the Doctor, Amy, and Rory can attest to. Great comedic moments are sprinkled throughout, keeping the show from ever taking itself too seriously (because guess what, it doesn't!). Although the show is never known for its logic and science (it still isn't; hard science-fiction this is not), the characters and narrative are always great and never falter over the course of the season.<br /><br />The production is also just as great, too. The new theme tune, while it takes some getting used to (and still doesn't fully compare to the epic version that graced series four), is still excellent and the new opener is nice and flashy, while also fitting the slightly different style of the new season. The logo itself also fits the new season well, adding to the fresh new feel of the show. The effects continue to wow, with some great monsters appearing, such as the vampires in Venice or Prisoner Zero, ones that can scare and intrigue at the same time. The make-up and design for the humanoid aliens is also still excellent, with some great designs appearing over the course of the season (including some great cameos in a certain episode). Lastly, the set pieces are still phenomenal this season, with Starship UK, the underground in \\"Cold Blood\\", and the Earth's sky in \\"The Big Bang\\" all working well to complement their episodes and set the right tones, especially in the case of the last example. Even the TARDIS gets a makeover, becoming a flashy piece of beauty that fits the Eleventh Doctor perfectly. The music also stays consistent and great, with shining examples that set the mood, like when the Pandorica is finally seen in its mysterious way in \\"The Big Bang\\".<br /><br />Overall, this season didn't lose a single touch of the excellence from the seasons before it. The writing and production of the show stay consistent, and the reboot that accompanies the new Doctor is fresh and exciting. Anyone worried that the show would falter when Steven Moffat took over has no need to worry. Despite all of the changes to the show, this is still the same Doctor Who.

B00C28J2VQ|2.0|And it bombed pretty badly.  The freebies, e-book and personalized dog tags, were nice, but...  The movie was not very exciting or fun.  Pretty boring honestly.  Wanted to like it, really did.  I like action packed special effects movies.  But this one just didn't make it.  Acting was pretty cardboard, effects were not so good - really, rope running over snow-capped cliffs somewhere fighting ninjas?  Pity with the cast a better, more on the edge of your seat, couldn't be made.  Maybe just too much .

193700788X|1.0|I have been a fan of this series for years -- never watched the show but loved the books. Over the last few, I've been fearing that this was where she was leading the series but just couldn't believe it. I wanted the magic back from the early four to six books. Why oh why this ending!!!! So anticlimactic. So disappointed. After this wonderful world she created to leave us here stinks.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|The reviews and previews of this movie did not do it justice.  We didn't even bother to see it at the 2.00 theater.  One night we were flipping around HBO, saw it was coming on and thought, &#34;Why not&#34;.  We then laughed so hard we nearly peed ourselves for the following 2 hours.  Everyone is cast perfectly and the 2 surprise appearances were also a blast.  I am not comparing this to &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; nor could it quite give &#34;Dirty Rotten Scoundrals&#34; a run for its money, but this was definitely the funniest movie I saw all year.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|My wife and I were ready to watch a movie at home one evening, and by chance tuned by our local PBS station. This performance of &#34;Phantom&#34; was on so we started watching. Thus, our movie idea dissipated and we were totally absorbed in the Royal Albert Halls magic. We had to pause it several times as the emotions were overpowering. The next day I ordered the blu-ray version through Amazon. The picture quality is breathtaking as is the performance. We are all familiar with Phantom so no analysis is necessary here, but for comparison with a theater version, this is better than going out. We saw it performed at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles some years ago, but the 25th anniversary is far superior especially Sierra Bogges' Christine. You will be in tears after her graveyard scene. The entire package is highly recommended.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|good game and free. I would give it ten stars if i could. amazingly terrific and one of my top favorite games to play.

Nothing beats a good western and Lonesome Dove is not just good, it is brilliant.<br />What a great story.Then put together Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones and you have a guaranteed Classic.<br />All I can say is I can't wait to watch this movie again,in fact my wife and I loved it so much that we ordered the sequel Commanche Moon and also Return to Lonesome Dove.<br />We are looking forward to receiving both of these movies soon.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|For some reason, Amazon seems to have blended the reviews for the deluxe \\"Toy Box\\" collection, the 3D trilogy, and what I'll refer to as the \\"standard\\" set - aka the \\"Toy Story 1-3 Box Set [Blu-ray]\\" [[ASIN:B0042FZOFU Toy Story 1-3 Box Set [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />As a result, many of the 'most helpful' reviews for all three sets mention the poor packaging of the Toy Box edition - namely the use of a foam housing rather than individual cases.<br /><br />But fear not! I am here to reassure you that unlike the Toy Box collection, the packaging for the standard Blu-ray box set is actually quite nice. All three movies have their own plastic Blu-ray cases, and arrive housed within a barebones, yet functional plastic 'sleeve' (the same shown in the product image). I plan to add some pictures of the packaging, in case anyone might benefit from it. In all, it's a great set that is far better packaged than the reviews might direct you to believe.

I love a lot of Phil Anselmo projects but, I cant seam to get behind this album. NOW LET ME MAKE ONE THING CLEAR, this is not a bad album by any stretch of the imagination it's just not a great album. In fact; I can still rock out to a couple of the tracks, but as a full album it's not something that I'm going to highly recommend.

B003ZMF26W|2.0|I wanted this mouse to work, I generally liked it, but it has reliability issues. The first one I had; I broke the right-click. I replaced it with another, eventually the mouse stopped loading on bootup so I would have to unplug and replug the mouse every time I booted up, that got old after a few weeks. I re-installed the mouse drivers, when that didn't work I re-installed my motherboard usb drivers. That did not fix the problem either.<br /><br />I used the software which came with the mouse, which has a support/update option. I ran the update which then started updating the firmware. The update failed with a Error Code=21, Step=4--so then the mouse does not work at all, completely broken because the firmware update has crashed halfway through updating, and will not complete when retrying. Uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers does not make the mouse work again because it is a corrupt firmware issue.<br /><br />It turns out that this is a known issue for windows 7 64bit, and it will only work on 32 bit systems as stated here in #11! [...]<br />So, after years of this mouse being on the market Cool Master hasn't bothered to fix their own update which breaks their mouse, and the only way to fix it is to find a 32 bit operating system somewhere else. Not even a warning on the update to not run it on a 64bit system, not even a fix uploaded to the website...Ridiculous.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love the in game play. Wonderful graphics story line etc... would like to see some of the glitches fixed. Even though the glitches are highly annoying  I still play because the game is that good. I wish there was a way to convert coin into dollars or at least a way to earn dollars. It seems that i run out of money and then it's gone. What's ironic is that I have to buy more?!?<br /> Overall I am thoroughly satisfied with this game and would like to see it become even more. It really has a Age of Empire feel to it with a swirl of Farmville. Amazing game how sweet the sound that The Oregon Trail plays. Well this is my two cents. ENJOY THIS GAME AS MUCH AS I DO! DEFINATELY WORTH YOUR TIME.

0399162097|2.0|The depiction of memory, the uncertainty, having to search for truth: was it real, was that a story told to me or did I just make it up. This part of the book resonated with me.<br /><br />I can't imagine any conservative writer describing a character as having a Democratic hairstyle.<br /><br />I also feel irritated that I wasted time or money on a book written by an author whose political bias is so blatant. NOT her horror of the tragedy of animal suffering or her wish to stop the suffering, but her preaching for her personal political bent. She had me caught, I was ready to march with PETA but she veered away from having the focus on the tragedy of caged mistreated animals and lectured about her politics.

No matter what book i am reading if i come acrossed this one i read it again! there is nothing in this book i could complain about, and the kindle edition is perfect.

1593272200|5.0|/**<br />* Name: Charles<br />* Age: 23<br />* Purchased: May, 2013<br />*/<br /><br />Organization:<br /> [0] -> The book is divided into chapters.<br />  [1] -> Each chapter has multiple sections.<br />  [2] -> Each chapter ends with a summary.<br />  [3] -> At the very end of each chapter are exercises meant to reinforce what was learned in the chapter.<br /><br />This is by far one of the best computer science texts I own.  I did not purchase this book as a requirement for a class (though I am a student), but I did purchase it for 'personal consumption' and to further my knowledge of programming and grow as a unix/linux systems programmer.<br /><br />I have read many computer science books by many different publishers and I have to admit I really enjoy the books that I own that were printed by No Starch press.  I was turned on to this book by an interest in C/C++ socket programming and systems programming in general.  I have a background in web development and had been programming in C for about a year when I purchased this book.<br /><br />There is something to learn for everyone in this book, regardless of how many years or decades of experience you have.  The book starts with a history of Unix, Linux, and standards, and then progresses into the great detail the inner workings of linux and unix.<br /><br />One of my biggest disappointments with most other programming books is that the authors use bad analogies to explain how things work, or fail to explain how things work at all and only offer a shallow glimpse into the subject.  Some authors seem to go back over their books adding stupid and unintelligent filler to try and make the book longer.  This book is over 1500 pages and each page is jam packed with information.  In fact, I'm sure there was information that was deemed 'not important' enough to make it into this book, and thus the book references how one can find more information on a topic.<br /><br />I have so many good things to say about this book,I highly recommend it to anybody with an interest in linux systems programming.  You will need an understanding of C programming to get through the book.  If you are looking for a book on how to program in C, this is not the book.  If you are a C programmer, or are learning C, and would like a book that shows you how to apply your programming knowledge to the linux and unix operating systems, this is a book for you.<br /><br />This is a book for system admins, network admins, hackers, teachers and professors, students (high school, college, or graduate), makers, computer scientists, etc.<br /><br />This is one book that I know I will carry with me everywhere.  Or I will buy multiple copies so that I don't have to lug around this heavy, 1500+ pg hardcover book.  Definitely a book you want at home, at the office, on the plain, in the car, in the bathroom, or anywhere else you can think of reading!<br /><br />This is the most well written programming book that I own!

The twists and turns Ms. Moriarty lays out for the reader are logical and plausible and these perfectly human characters will stay with you for a long time.

This will surely become the next big book club read.

B00CRS88IO|5.0|Can't wait to read Operation Trinity!!!!<br />keep writing, Damian !!!!<br />Send me when ready to publish it !!!!!<br />Thank you!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I can review my e. mails and if I choose not to open one due to a suspicious nature I can delete it.  Yahoo has recently informed me that someone or thing was trying to get into my account and ask if I would change my password.  This is great having an organization looking out for an individual.  I feel it is the best I have had others in the past and really love this one.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It gives me everything I need, the app is very easy to use, and has neat extras. I like being able to easily bring up different locations fast.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Decent hidden item game with interesting story. Not the best but not the worst game ever. Good for a free game. Challenging but not so hard that you have to spend real money to survive.
B00116FT6M|5.0|This is a great remake of a classic and John Trovolta is astounding aloong with all of the rest of the cast
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Fun, funny, clever, hilarious...Steve Carell with a Russian accent...this is such a cute movie all around, very heartwarming. Our whole family absolutely loves it!
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This documentary is a testimony to the fact that really talented musicians don't need computer technology to create good music.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Wow. When I first started to read this story, I didn't expect it to be so...Well, good. The main character((and other characters, don't get me wrong)) in this story are so well developed its crazy. Upon reading the last two pages of the story, I couldn't help but get a bit emotional. That Charlie character is truly selfless, and though he is a fictional character, an inspiration really. Quite odd really, I never expected to think that either when I first started reading. Oh well, never judge a book by its cover! This is, as said before, an amazing story, I think I would recommend this to everyone. -SP
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Loved it though the whole thing. Read it to your enjoyment I dare u you. Very very very good book
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|It took a long time to get to thhe big screen, but it is worth the wait..  Amazing work be  all of the cast members, a delightful surprise  for all the fans of these actors and Broadway in general.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I'm hooked!  I've seen the Sons of Anarchy advertised over the years but never really got around to watching it.  After watching the first season with my Amazon Prime account, I'm on my way to watching all the series available.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Not as good as the first Bourne movie, but probably as good as the sequels.  I really like Jeremy Renner, and he was good in this role.  Nothing about this movie really stands out though.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I loved the book. Fall of Giants was better for me but only because I feel that less is known about that period. I am always touched by the way Follett captures our human experience.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|One of the finest and most creative works of fiction broought to the screen.  HBO films has outdone itself with this seriess.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Couldn't get through the first 45 minutes of this lame movie. I wouldn't wish this crappy movie on my worst enemy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun great for mom and kids. Free. A must have. Love the minions and all the villains. Bright colors. FUN
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Special effects were good and the story line could have led up to the history of the three brothers powers.  I hope the rest are as god or better.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|I've read a lot of books on sales, success, etc. The entire genre, this one spoke to me more than any other. A great read, great advice, excellent book in every way.
B008JFUO36|2.0|Oblivion is the ultimate Hollywood movie wet-dream: horse manure script, an acting-free zone, no story-line worth a mention but... incredibly beautiful CGI. It's probably worth watching just for the visual images created inside a cloud's worth of computers, so long as you can switch off all critical faculties and pretend that you're watching a montage. Otherwise this movie is just an infantile and irritating waste of time with more plot holes than a truly perforated Swiss cheese (and far more odiferous). But really, the CGI is amazing.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Like many, I switched to Feedly when google reader died. Feedly does everything I need and looks pretty. No real complaints, though the currently being discussed \\"pro\\" version concerns me a bit.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Good plot/story line, that Hollywood tried to make into Star Wars. Still good tho, check it out :).<br /><br />Enjoy :)
B0018OFN4U|5.0|If you have a girl who hates Zombie movies, have her watch this one. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have become two of my favorite actors and do such an amazing job in anything they do together! This movie is very funny! I love seeing other familiar faces pop up here and there (Bill Nighy for example) and the movie has plenty of action/bad-ass zombie killing scenes. When you can't decided between action and comedy, why not get both?! This movie will definitely not disappoint! Chick-approved!
B002BVQU5A|5.0|This film skipped by me when it first debuted, but I'm very glad I finally got to see it. Johnny Depp was sensational in the film, and I loved Aiden Quinn's performance, too. This was an original movie with an original plot, something so refreshing in today's &#34;remake&#34; film world, and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys good plots and great acting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely had me on the edge of my seat! I'm not happy with everything that happened, but the show is great. Can't wait to see season 4.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|999 is probably my favorite game on the DS at this point. It is a puzzle game, which is frustrating at times (when the puzzles don't come with any instructions or hints, it feels like you're just doing random stuff) but exciting at others. It has elements of detective games and psychological thrillers, which was what ultimately drew me in. You really have to pay attention to solve the puzzles and complete the game for the &#34;true ending&#34;.<br /><br />The characters and their stories are interesting. Their relationships to one another and how they talk to each other is really interesting too. Still, the thing that keeps me playing this game over and over again is the psychological and scientific aspect of the game. Although it is fictional, many elements of the story are rooted in fact or at least exist in other fictional realms, which make the story and its components even more fascinating.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I thought it would have the plug for the wall but it did not.  I had to purchase the wall plug separately.  Other than that, the product works well.

B007TKT2SK|5.0|I love this app. It is simple and does everything i need. I thought i was going to suffer on doing math with fractions until i found this app. It is simple and easy to you and recommend it if you need to do fractions math and shows both fraction form and decimal numbers.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is the absolutely best show ever. I hope they keep on showing new series. I just love these guys. Such and awesome group.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|Oblivion was a good action movie. A good ending.<br />Tom Cruise was very good in the movie. Great plot and special effectss

B009LQKHIO|4.0|I usually don't read romance but I won Finding Pride by Jill Sanders and it's also a free kindle fire download. If you like to feel as though you are back home in a small town where everybody knows you and cares about you and your family. This is a great book and series to read. It has a very nice storyline and the characters are all defined. There is romance and some people trying to start a new life after a horrible abusive relationship. Of course there are sad and dramatic moments and lots of important decisions that have to be made. I really liked the book and read it in 2 days. It didn't jump out at me like a 5 star but I liked it so much that I just started to read book 2 Discovering Pride. I think she is a self published author! Also Jill can be found on facebook and would love to chat with you if you have questions about the books. I did and it so nice to speak with the author. enjoy.:)
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I like Matthew McConaughey in almost every movie I've seen of his.  This movie is no exception.  While not totally believable, it was good entertainment, sometimes that's all you want.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Mostly user friendly with a few issues.  Not much info available on how t o set up music feature. Overall I would recommend.
B008220C56|2.0|The movie's style was somewhat awkward.  Alternating between a play about the story and the story.  Hard to follow, I did not enjoy it.  Glad I rented it before I made the purchase.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|&#34;Dark of The Moon&#34; was likeable. A Different twist to the series, but the previous two Transformers movies were better.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The authors have done an amazing work in telling the story of two combatants and that combat doesn't have to rob one of his humanity. It was most revealing to get an insiders view of the German combat pilot and to learn that there was a strongly held code of chivalry and personal honor. I found myself rejoicing with Stigler as he came to know the outcome and blessings  of his decision to allow his enemy to live on that day in 1943.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I could watch this series over and over again. What a great story and characters. Thank you for providing this for Prime Members for free!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|So far so good. Plays almost all videos I select. A few get hung up. Still trying to figure out some of the features but overall I'm happy with it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|cant get it to work on my lphone or kindle  it takes so long to download you just get feed up
B00304RMFE|5.0|What else can I say? This is a great collection of expansive Halo backstory. A must watch for any true Halo fan.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a really great game. The constant lack of energy is a little annoying, but it's not enough to make me stop playing.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I thought it was a great book I had a hard time not putting it down.  It keep my interest from the first page.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I really enjoyed reading about the life of Buck.  He had an interesting time and, through his life, one can see much of the hard life that faced most Alaskans and the varying natures of those people.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I would recommend this game to family and friends it so fun and addicting. I just can't get enough of this game
B00064WSOQ|4.0|In an article for The All Music Guide, Bruce Eder suggests that King Crimson is one of the Progressive Rock bands from the late 60s which, by the 80s and 90s had dramatically changed its approach to music-making in such a way that they alienated their first most ardent listeners: \\"[they] altered their sound so radically as to become unrecognizable to their original fans.\\"  However \\"The Power to Believe\\" suggests that this is simply untrue.  The recording is actually very similar in terms of composition, style and execution to 1973's \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\".<br />In the past, Robert Fripp has expressed mistrust of the studio-recorded album.  He sees Crimson primarily as a live band and is himself an advocate of experiencing music live first and foremost as both a performer and a listener.  Perhaps then we can assume that any studio recording by Crimson is a creative compromise.  What's extraordinary about both Fripp and the Crimson juggernaut though is - unlike their prog-rock contemporaries - how consistently high the quality of their recorded output has been over an extended period of time.<br />In his book on Fripp, Eric Tamm best sums up the King Crimson sound as \\"what happens when [Bela] Bartok meets Hendrix\\".  What he means by this is the unique way that Crimson combines the calculated, highly cerebral elements of the best 20th-century composers with the intuitive rawness of the best that rock music has to offer.  The result is not something that will be liked by every listener but Fripp has never sought to be less than demanding.<br />There are moments on the recording that have such rawness of power: \\"Level Five\\", \\"Facts of Life\\" but there are also moments of great beauty and lyricism too: \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" and \\"The Power to Believe II\\".  \\"The Power to Believe\\" is not for everyone but thank the LORD that a cluster of musicians are still producing music that is dynamic, arresting, beautiful and forward-thinking in this current day and age.
B00CVDM8QS|3.0|I agree with Dawkins' point of view. I agree with his arguments.<br /><br />I had two basic problems with the book, so lowered my rating:<br /><br />- The author uses tiresome examples like \\"imagine each year is one sheet of paper\\".<br />- The science he discusses is pretty basic, I found it kind of boring.<br /><br />For those who choose to believe in \\"magic\\" (translate as religion), and are interested in seeing the world in a more realistic, equally magical way, this book may be worth reading.
B00000J7SS|5.0|This album has it all, every track is great and the album as a whole is solid. Worthwhile buy for any jazz lover.
B0091THRCU|3.0|Great quality and really protect your iPhone in case of a drop. The bad thing is that when your using your phone is unprotected.<br />But after that is a nice sleeve.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|MY ACTUAL RATING: 4.4<br />I like the four pretty girls, but I wish two girls were at least free instead of only Jenny, but she's workable with. Another thing that relieves me is that you don't have to go through the steps of clearing her skin and washing her hair, and that's something some people might choose not to do. There's limited makeup but I think that's enough for one girl. I love the dresses, shoes, jewelry, etc. at the end which makes a great conclusion for creating your princess. Overall, I reccomend this app to anyone.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Most of the games I have are basically for passing time. But Quell makes you work...hard.  Disguised with relaxing music and serene graphics, this is no mind numbing video game, but a game that forces you to think. I tend to be impulsive and not very good at thinking ahead, but Quell makes you to do just that. As challenging as it may be, it's still very enjoyable. I've finished all the levels, and now I'm working on completing them all in as few moves as possible. I can almost feel my brain sweat as Quell puts it through a workout! My favorite game.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Fantastic storyline!!  Page turner! I can't wait to learn more  about the characters in the  next book.  Thank you for an amazing and intricate book!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Highly recommended if you have even a passing interest in fantasy novels, and even if you don't. A gripping tale that is beautifully written and almost impossible to put down. One of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. Rothfuss has created a masterpiece with this trilogy. His prose is beautiful and mesmerizing, and his lead character is fascinating. I couldn't put this book down until I had finished It, and then I immediately bought book 2: \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\", which I also highly recommend. Now I am counting the days until the third book is released. The bottom line: read \\"The Name of the Wind\\" and then read \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\". You won't be disappointed.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|This tv show will pull you in and keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next.  I enjoyed every season!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Very few movies are so well conceived, acted, directed, filmed and edited as this.  It isn't just a gem, it is a Faberge Egg.  I would give it five stars if it weren't about performers.  I am very tired of performers--not while they are acting--but when they are consumed with telling their own stories.  They are, by and large, very tiresome people, often thinking they are important people just because they once played one, or received a standing ovation.  You know the type, they play Julius Cesar in High School, get a standing ovation, and then forever assume they are as important as old Julius.  Ultimately, this story is about tiresome people, being tiresome.<br /><br />But rather shortly after the movie started, I started to like some very briefly displayed characteristic of one of the very tiresome characters.  A mystery unfolded.  Would the spark catch?  Would the likable characteristic fade or blossom?  Would other blooms appear?  Would love triumph over tiresomeness?<br /><br />The movie is much like an old, barely attended garden in a languishing mansion's side yard.  It is near enough to the house that the very elderly widow who lives there steps out daily to sit on her wrought-iron throne.  From where she sits, there is still order and if not beauty, calming green, but from every other angle it is jungle.  One fine spring day, daffodils spring to bloom.  Long sleeping tulips peek toward the sky and offer surprising refinement.  A cherry tree breaks forth in song.  Old roses, long suffering, come into cascades of harmony.  The widow is provided with one last overwhelmingly beautiful view of glory before the garden succumbs to the jungle.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The kids love this game. I also have to admit that I too get sucked in. Great game with great graphics.
B007N31YH0|5.0|I love this film so much. It's a classic, and it's so funny. The device cam in fast, and it's great.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game! It's not your typical farm game. Yes you plant and harvest crops but it's so much more! The main thing I like about this game is your crops don't wither and die. So you don't feel like you HAVE to harvest your crops right when they ripen. You can leave it for later. You also take said crops and feed them too your animals or straight into machines to make more valuable items. You also have a small kitchen where you can cook using your homegrown ingredients for an even larger profit. There is no &quot;energy&quot; that you need to worry about  waiting for in this game either, other than in the kitchen. You can only make 30 dishes at a time all the while your time is counting down for more energy. You also have achievements. Such as harvest 1000 covers or honey.. as well as quests and daily time sensitive quests<br /> which you can choose to participate in or not. You are also able to add neighbors and visit them as well. One of the biggest bonuses to this game is that through completing achievements you earn RC dollars.(worth real money) you also receive 1RC dollar for each time you level up. You can also connect with Facebook for an additional 3 RC dollars though I have had some issues with connecting through my kindle fire HD.  Like I said I love this game, really enjoy it and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys farming simulator games or just wants to pay a really well made fun game.
B00DDTQE1Y|5.0|So far - I'm still learning how to work this app - but I'm very impressed with what I've learned so far. The improvements you can obtain from a &#34;border line&#34; photo are outstanding. Any &#34;good&#34; photo can be made to become outstanding in a couple of quick clicks. It makes me look like I know what I'm doing with a camera!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|The book was very good. A little boring, but still very good. I would definitely want to read this book again
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This has to be one of the best apps that we have to play! Every time you pick it up and play,  it is so very very hard to put it down! Only problem is getting more coins to buy items or upgrade tools!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this app..... just wish there were more ways to play.... other than that it is amazing and i enjoy it.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie because of the novel plot. Not overly done action or drama was a plus. The underlying message/ story line is unparallelled. Spoiler - This turned out to be a tale of one man and two wives. One was not a real wife and wanted to live in a small artificial and isolated world, the truth pushed out, where she hovered over her man, only allowing him the occasional escape to his man cave...cabin in the woods. With her as a partner, he was less than he was...more boy than man. Second wife was a true wife that he could bring into his man world and though not controlling, he was at his greatest with her in his world. He was man/hero in that world. She readily became part of his world and even after he was gone she remained there.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is great for kids and adults it's super it or it turbo ruby u h h h h
B00DU74U74|2.0|Long, boring and the whole inner voice thing is so distracting it ruins the film. All in all not worth the 2 hour nonsense
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very simple and basic. Works great on my kindle fire. The buttons are big and easy to see and if I flip it sideways it becomes a scientific calculator.
B00AF3ROM4|5.0|I loved the book, as it's a great read. I read it cover to cover in less than 24 hrs!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love this series and it's writer.  The only reason I rate it at 4 stars rather than five like the two before it was the lack of closure on any main issue in the book.  I understand with a series certain story lines must be kept going to keep the story rolling, but at least one major problem should be solved at the end of the book.  This one left me feeling as it it were the first half of a book that someone just picked a random point to stop at then continue in the next book.
B008MWBY6W|1.0|It's a nice looking bag, but the camera just disappears in it. It is way too large to be useful, there aren't enough dividers so one could keep a lens and the camera in it. They just bash into each other. This design is meant to store a camera snugly, I have never seen a camera large enough that would fit without flopping around, including some ancient huge first generation digital SLRs. If i could give it negative stars, I would, one star is far too generous.
B002ROKQJM|4.0|It felt like an insight into the India that most western societies dont really see...quite horrifying in its acceptance of the poverty and inequities even within their society.
0743497465|5.0|I loved the book, as it's a great read. I read it cover to cover in less than 24 hrs!
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|This game is cool because it can teach you what word has two words in it.you should download it now! :-)
B003L77GRO|5.0|Love it, love it, love it! Dexter is one of the best shows out there and all I can say is that it's thrilling! Can't wait to watch more of the seasons! :D The box set was received in great condition and it was received super quick! Great show and love it! ;)
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|This App gave me the ability to travel through time! I visited the Great Wall of China during its construction, and saw some wicked cool dragons! I'm only giving it three stars though because Qin Shi Huangdi was really rude to me. I didn't realize that was his takeout, my bad dude. All in all, it's an okay game.
0307474275|5.0|I loved the book, as it's a great read. I read it cover to cover in less than 24 hrs!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is one of those shows that suffered from lousy promotion and impatient network execs.  It should have been saved just to build an audience.  Endearing characters, great writing, and a very unique perspective of a future full of odd juxtapositions; a hover craft traveling down a dusty old west town amidst horses; bad guys with cowboy hats riding on horses and carrying laser guns.  The crew of Serenity is a tight knit family of oddballs and heroes.  Joss Whedon created a masterpiece and no one knew about it.  Well, at least, I didn't.  14 episodes shown in the sequence intended by Whedon, all with suspense, action, character development, and humor.  Now off to watch &#34;Serenity&#34; the followup movie made several years later.  Put this series on your watch list and enjoy.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I just love all the Dexter seasons! I just wish this show wouldn't end so soon. However, this box set was received in great condition and it was received speedily! :)
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is compact I can take it in my pocket , I'm a officer and carry two knives at all times so it is useful.
0312944926|5.0|I loved the book, as it's a great read. I read it cover to cover in less than 24 hrs!
B001CDWFPC|4.0|It's the Bible- content is life changing.  Now a couple of thoughts about the app functionality.  These thoughts are for meant as request to the editors/developers.  It would be nice if somewhere on the screen your current location was referenced, &#34;Acts 1:8&#34;, not page &#34;978/1256&#34;.  A one touch &#34;GoTo&#34; button would nice for the times your are verse hopping.  Otherwise I love the app and I use it all the time.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. Love the broadway version, and of course Gerry Butler. He is a hottie!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It's such a good  book and I can't take my hands off of it!! This is a definite 5 star book!!
0307950689|5.0|I loved the book, as it's a great read. I read it cover to cover in less than 24 hrs!
B009K6DKTS|5.0|Another refreshing read.<br /><br />I own and have read Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness, and recommend both.<br /><br />Taleb thinks differently.
B000065V42|3.0|This is a must own movie, however I should have looked closer before ordering this.  Who sells FULL screen DVDs anymore?<br />Amazon, that's who..!  $5 for a Disney movie is a bargain however, if you want wide screen keep looking since this version isn't.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Great &#34;meek&#34; performance by Denzel. Truly enjoyed the movie and the suprise ending. Denzel is aging wonderfully. I so love the way this man walks too.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is about more than zombies it's about humanity, life as we know it know it being irrevocably changed. What would happen if culture, religion, race, ethnicity, beliefs etc were temporarily eliminated? Even something as basic as first and third world, how would humanity react? Could we band together or would we lose the war for life? It reminds me of the speech given in the movie by the president when he is talking the troops....it wasn't a war for territory, wealth, or anything that trivial, it was a war for the human race, for survival. This book is definitely about that on an even deeper level. You don't realize it at first but slowly it becomes more than zombies but a book about who we are as the human race.
B00CWVFZ8W|3.0|The movie does not live up to the expectations of the novel. I'm still contemplating was the acting really that bad or was the script horrible or a combination of BOTH!
B0084IG7KC|1.0|I don't know how to describe wasting money on this worthless movie. I watched the Japanese version first and it was ok but, not all that great. I might even be able to make it through a second or even a third viewing but I don't think my stomach could deal with watching this awful version. Pretty faces a few special effects and Hollywood calls it a movie.  I have no idea why this is getting high ratings.  Maybe its a bunch of pre-teens that got in without a guardian. Don't even rent it. If you must watch it, rent or buy the Asian version.
B004P7CMUU|5.0|This was a movie that I saw several years ago and knew I had to add it to my collection. I have not viewed it yet, but it arrived earlier than promised in a factory sealed package.
B005PK57NU|4.0|At times a little slow, but I love seeing Alicia come into her own as a single parent and more experienced lawyer. High quality writing and actors including many wonderful guest stars.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I found this book to be very much in line with the scholarship of other authors on the subject of the historical Jesus such as Bart Erhman.  I didn't find the information new or surprising, although I did appreciate the time given to the James, brother of Jesus vs. Paul and their likely relationship.  I also loved his descriptions of how the Temple itself operated within the structure of the society.  This book was easy to read and digest - it is not a long book and it is written in a way that is clear and more to the point than some other types of religious history books.  I am giving it five stars for its readability.  While it may upset some people who are literal in their Christian beliefs there are also many Christians who will read it and not find any problem with the thesis.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|While the chords seem repetitive they are still so differing to change the ambiance of the movie. They resonated well with me. The beat and sounds worked so very well.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Definitely not one of Matthew McConaughey's best performances as the movie is being touted. It drags in parts and it's predictable.
B005DN5BE4|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and believed it to be believably accurate. It was entertaining, but distressing to see that people could treat others in such a manner. Highly recommended, but be prepared for emotions to run high.
B00BJDARGO|1.0|Nobodies-fault but mine. And mine alone. I will keep this to few words. Don't buy it until you read few of it's negative reviews. And the negative reviews are true. I learned my lesson and will never blind buy any music Blu-rays ever, even if it is from Pink Floyd.
B002436WFI|3.0|I love this movie, and bought the dvd in good part to watch the extras (listed on the product page as &#34;A gag reel, deleted scenes and cast interviews&#34;). Sadly, those extras are missing completely.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|A very good and enjoyable read. My only complaint is that sometimes the author jumps around with the time line, which makes the story hard to follow. But that only happened a few times, hence my rating of 4.5 stars.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Well, after reading everyone's comments when I was making my build a couple months ago, I thought I'd pay it back and tell you about this processor.<br /><br />I was going to buy the i3-3210 but on the day of my purchasing, I saw Amazon had a deal with this i3 and the exact motherboard I was looking to buy (MSI H77MA-G43). For an extra $15 at the time (I got my i3 at $130), this i3 seemed worth it... and let me tell you, it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />I bought the i3-3220 for a budget gaming rig, and the game I play the most is a steam game called Natural Selection 2 made by a small indie gaming company. As a result, the game wasn't well optimized and is very CPU intensive. It was entirely unplayable on my old AMD Athlon X2 (lol, I know, that's like a 4 year old processor so I couldn't expect much), but with this i3 in the rig, the game plays completely smoothly - 70-80 fps. I do also have an nVidia GTX 650ti, but only 4gbs of 1600MB RAM, so I am very, very happy with the performance of this CPU. For my needs and budget, it was the perfect solution.<br /><br />I have read some comments which mention that most games even today do not utilize more than 4 cores, and in my case, NS2 doesn't use more than 2 at any point. Knowing that, I knew I wouldn't need a 3570k, and I would reiterate what some others have said - check to see how many cores the applications you are looking to run can actually utilize. This i3 may be all you need!<br /><br />One last thing I can add about the performance of this processor... when I went to install it, I was a bit of a novice and... installed the CPU cooler in a way such that the wire prevented the fan from turning. Not realizing what had initially happened, I played the CPU HARD for the first week I had it, without any cooling. After multiple long gaming sessions, I realized my fan case was spinning pretty noisily and I decided to check the CPU temperature - for the first week I had it, when I was gaming for multiple hours, it was running at around 90-100C! All I can say is that, after realizing what the problem was, I fixed the fan, and now the computer runs around 38C under full load. I have had this CPU for about 3 months now, and while I realize I can't comment on what kind of permanent damage I may have done to the CPU, I CAN say that it survived (quite a feat, and shows you just how cool this processor runs) and has not failed. I do not expect it to in the coming months.<br /><br />YOU WILL NOT BE UNHAPPY WITH THIS I3!!!
1440503257|5.0|Bought for my best friend who is a huge harry potter fan. She enjoys it very much. Hasn't really made too much out of it though
B005MMY9A8|3.0|mediocre editing. listless acting.good special effects. all in all, a huge expense for moderate returns. glad I saw it 'free' and avoided paying movie ticket price.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Highly Recommend It with its adaptation from the book as well as show the background of the friction between the Elves and the Dwarves. It follows the book carefully with incredible visual effects.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|I thought this movie was just okay. Could have / should have been better considering the actors that are in it that usually do a good job in other movies they have been in. It was slightly difficult to follow and I had hoped for more action and suspense.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I understand this was a true story about one family that livd through this diseaster.  An amazing story!  I recommend this movie.
B001DEXDNI|5.0|&#34;Sing&#34; is great and &#34;Love Song For A Vampire&#34; from the credits in &#34;Brahm Stoker's Dracula&#34; STILL gives me chills even after all these years. Just a good all around Greatest Hits CD with a few new ones that will in fact be EPIC. Only track missing that I would have liked to see on this CD was &#34;Into The West&#34; from the LOTR movies.
B00A83075M|5.0|Great movie. It's about a Game character who was programmed to be a villain yearns to be like his opponent and be a good guy. He goes on a journey to find his true purpose and to be loved and respected.
0375869026|5.0|It took awhile for my 10 year-old son to get into it, but it brings up some great topics of discussion.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|i really like the ability to stand the Kindle Fire up and not have to hold it.  I don't drop the unit alot, so that was my main reason for buying the case and to protect the screen.  So far I really like it and would recommend it.
B000002VMH|5.0|Yup, loved this one too. You can't go wrong with this one either. Seriously, if theres a bad song on here I want to know which one it is!
B009O07NDY|5.0|This soundtrack from the first Hobbit film brings some excitement with the bold and colorful music as it brings the flavor of Middle Earth to life.
B008JFURKG|5.0|I watched RED 2 (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) at my local theater.  Frankly, I like this movie a lot!  And everyone else in the theater seemed to like it too.<br /><br />The film has a great cast with good acting.  Great script, screenplay, direction all combine to make this an enjoyable (and yes, fun!) film.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta Jones is great as a Russian General - incredibly hot, she prompts a jealous reaction from Frank Moses' wife (Ms. Parker).  Reprising their roles from RED is Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Mary Louis Parker, and John Malkovich.  Brian Cox rounds out a superb cast.<br /><br />On Rotten Tomatoes, this film garnered just a 42% rating from the critics - this says a lot more about the collective incompetence of the critics, since the film is objectively a fabulous action/adventure/comedy.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: ignore the critics and go see it - especially if you enjoy action/comedy and you enjoyed the first (RED).

B009GED3HS|5.0|Easy to stream and download. Good quality even though its not HD. I love how I met your mother, this was a great option to catch up.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|A friends young daughter accidently (or not) put this on my kindle but it has become my favorite game.  It is very challenging with plenty of levels and different games.  Lots of fun.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love bingo and this one fun . Have it on all my devices. The different room are fun. Kids also like to play it and it is not difficult for them.

B007ZXK08C|3.0|I was gripped by this story from page one, and could not put it down. The author has created an incredibly convoluted tale with great skill, though I was a bit surprised at some of the twists and turns. However, the reasons for those became apparent in the final chapters. The characters are not at all attractive, apart form Margot. She has a social compass. The ending for me was somewhat infuriating, but gave me food for thought. Read it and enjoy the ride.

B00628RVV0|4.0|It was good and sad. My nine year old niece recommended this movie to the whole family because her teacher told the class to watch it.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is great and the tiles are easy to see which are turned on and off.  I like the many different layouts.  One of the best Mahjong's I have tried
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I could not put it down!  There is a good plot, you really feel connected to the characters.  Very good trilogy.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Donna is my favorite. Awesome. Harvey and Mike make great protagonists. In the last few episodes I started to struggle rooting for Harvey. I hope he is restored in season 3.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I ordered this movie as a 2 day rental. My daughter loved it so I bought the DVD. Really cute movie.
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|DEAD MAN DOWN is about Victor (Farrell) and Beatrice (Rapace). Victor's a high-ranking enforcer on Alphonse's crime syndicate, and Beatrice is a lonely Spanish lady who still nurses a grudge against the drunk driver that scarred her pretty face up in an auto accident. Both of them nurse revenge fantasies against those who did them wrong, and as the movie develops, those fantasies intertwine as they come close to being made real.<br /><br />The film is boldly and artfully shot, and edited with equally impressive skill. This helps make up for some slow pacing; the film could've been about twenty minutes shorter had it not been so aggressively introspective and even repetitive in some parts (let's just say there's a whole lotta mulling going on). The story's not bad at all as far as these kinds of revenge thrillers go, although it's not trying too hard to be terribly creative, either. The soundtrack and the film's patient reveal of certain secrets (the less you know about the plot going into the film, the better, although it seems like every single review keeps trying to give away vital information that viewers don't learn until something like forty minutes in) keeps the slow-moving plot from feeling too labored, as do a handful of very tightly wound action sequences.<br /><br />There are a few other problems beside the run-time and the unequal balance of drama and thriller (and the film's horrible title). Farrell doesn't seem to do much acting at all in the entire film, opting instead to keep a neutral look of dull surprise on his face for most of the movie. He's supposed to be a man of quietly brooding inner passion, but you'd think maybe once or twice we'd get a shot of him showing some other kind of emotion. Likewise, Beatrice's character is initially driven by rage over her mangled appearance (little kids constantly taunt her, calling her a monster), but the scars on her face are barely noticeable in some shots. If they really wanted her character to make sense, they should've really disfigured her more than they did. As it is, it's quite obvious they wanted viewers to still find her pretty (her scars do little more than highlight her cheekbones and jaw), which makes her part in the story seem pretty contrived at first.<br /><br />Get past those little hang-ups and be prepared to deal with a handful of stretches where characters engage in silent, soulful reflection, and you should have a good time with this bang-em-up.hey should've really disfigured her more than they did.

B0024RI72U|5.0|This CD is for any fan of Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion', even if metal isn't really your taste. Each song is powerful and true to the source material. My personal favorites include 'Time Stands Still' and 'When Sorrow Sang'.<br /><br />It's more enjoyable for a diehard fan of Tolkien, like myself, than for someone who knows nothing of the story, like my dad, I've found.<br /><br />Anyways, the shipping was quick and it came sooner than expected. I highly recommend.
0385738781|5.0|Oh my god, definitely a good book to end a trilogy which... you don't find often. (SPOILERS AHEAD)<br /><br />I found myself lost in this series, and to finally get to the end, it was so bittersweet. I didn't want to finish Thomas and Minho and Newt's stories. I want them to last forever.<br /><br />It started off with a bang as usual. Get your memories back, or not, after Thomas was held for a month alone with no human interaction, not shower, nothing. Thomas, Minho, and Newt decided that they didn't want their memories back, but guess what? WICKED didn't care and was going to force them until they broke out along with Brenda (my girl) and Jorge.<br /><br />They go to Denver and they get the tracking device taken out of their heads which also cause them to be controlled by WICKED. We get a taste of that when they go to remove it, Thomas starts acting like a wild man and trying to kill everyone.<br /><br />Oh did I mention that we find out that Newt isn't immune to the Flare and ultimately starts going crazy after the break out and gets thrown in a Crank camp and I cried a million tears because he is ultimately my favorite? Did I also mention that he wrote a note to Thomas asking him to kill him when things got bad and that... Thomas took a gun to his head when Newt wasn't crazy and killed his friend out of love? Yeah, I was devastated. My favorites ALWAYS die.<br /><br />In the end, Thomas, Minho, Brenda and the other Gladers and Group B (Newt and Teresa are the major casualties this time around) make it through to a paradise where the Flare hasn't damaged the world, where they can repopulate the world with immune people (what I'm assuming will ultimately happen). A world they can be happy. And that's how it ended, with a breath of relief. Tears of relief as well.<br /><br />Finishing this series made me feel like I actually lost a best friend and it was very hard to realize it was over and I wouldn't wake up the next day and find out more about Thomas and his friends.nds.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Pretty good game for kids. Just saw D2 so being able to play game was well timed. Not to challenging but enjoyable none the less.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|What can I say, it's good fun entertainment. One of my favorites, and will keep you constantly laughing. Great for those young and young at heart :).
0240810961|5.0|Very pleased with our purchase of this book. Our grandaughter in South America found it most necessary and fundamental for her college studies. Thanks.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|I can only rate the parts of the film I was allowed to see, and I didn't want to relate to a chop shop version, so I'll be back after the restored version.<br /><br />However, I do know that the production is masterful, and the length and rhythm...perhaps more suited to these times, when it could have become a mini-series or even, given our era, a masterpiece production much as an American \\"Game of Thrones,\\" except that, of course, Americans don't like to see corruption and official brutality unless it's done by Italians or other minorities, or done by \\"corporate monsters\\" (meaning the guys we suck up for our paychecks and smile for the privilege) ,  or our yearly anti-slavery guilt-fest, sans guilt, because we know we're better than the racists, which we aren't, but that's a different discussion.<br /><br /> We're really not great about our own personal genocides, are we?  It's always Springtime for Hitler, it's just that, as John Lennon once said to derision, we all have Hitler (and Jesus) inside us, each and every one.<br /><br />As I say, I'll get back.  What I've seen is really good.  And in the meantime, if people haven't watched Little Big Man, it's way up time for that one!  And Pow Wow Highway.  Slighter, but also in its way a great film.
B000TU16GS|3.0|It was really boring at first then it got good but bad finish this book keeps u at the edge of ur seat
B008220BLG|5.0|This is a cute movie, and not your typical romance or zombie genre. It is a fresh new take on zombies. I love the humor!
0786860707|5.0|I ordered the book for my granddaughter who studies Animation Design!! Her professors recommended it as a source of consultation and for references.
B006LXQID8|5.0|If you're a little quirky, this is the movie for you.  One of those movies I never tire of seeing.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|In my opinion I think this is one of the greatest mystery games I have ever played. Its not a short game at all, it gets you thinking and if you play it non-stop this game will last you about two days if you don't use hints. Great graphics and I feel like it has no flaws whatsoever. It even gave me a couple of jumps.<br />Hint: If you want to use minimum hint usage use the map and see where the action is and go it does help.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I love this game and it would be a 5 star! But there is 1 big glitch. Every time I go bck. My gold and silver disappears... for example: 3days ago I had 13 gold coins and 136 silver coins and when I went bck later to do my scratches of free gold coins I had 0silver and whatever I scratch on gold.... so please fix this glitch getting very annoying. Where I do not even want to play.
048622709X|5.0|The book is for our grandaughter in South America. She found it highly good and very useful for her studies of art in college. Thanks for your great services and prompt shipment. Maria, K.C., MO, U.S.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Excellent CD.  Just starting to discover Vince Gill's music and wonderful voice.  That voice combined with the sweet, sweet sound of a steel guitar--wow!  There is no more beautiful sound in country music than a crying steel guitar and this is the album to hear it on!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Best book ever. I would tell others about it any time. Favorite book in the whole world. I love it.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|This was a present for a soldier over in Afghanistan, and she liked it very much.  She was looking for more viewing material for during her downtime, and this fit the bill.
B00821OX98|5.0|If you liked the old show V then you will really enjoy this show. It is a fascinating show that looks at not only what it would be like for an alien invasion but how society tries to keep on going.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book continues the saga well, with good suspense and even better character depth than the previous books.  Very worthwhile.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I love all the music for the LOTR movies, but I like this even more. I'm not sure exactly what it is about this soundtrack that has me listening to it so often, but it seems to have more of a flow to it. Themes are more developed, and then repeated. It's perfect for almost any mood, but overall, seems more pastoral and calming than some of the LOTR music. Even if you didn't love the movie, the soundtrack itself is worth revisiting on its own merits.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Ensightful, heartfelt, inspiring, funny, hopeful.  One of THE best books I have read.  Read it, you will not be disappointed.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I did not read the book before watching this movie, but the story line was intriguing.  The two lead characters have great chemistry and the kid actors are adorable. I was a little hesitant about watching it at first, but I would recommend it!
0399159347|5.0|I just finished reading this book. I loved it! I had a hard time putting it down! I want to see what else this author has written!
0439023521|2.0|Amazon lists The Hunger Games for grade 7 and up.  What exactly in this book is appropriate for seventh graders?  Teenagers killing each other?  The reading level is adult, the theme is revolting.  We do care about the main characters it's true.  Guess it's a sign of the times that Amazon considers this appropriate for young people, and that so many thousands give it a high rating.  Perhaps they are all 7th graders or at least have a 7th grade mentality.
0345529057|4.0|I've watched all 3 seasons of Game of Thrones on HBO & really like the series.  I bought the books because I thought reading them would help me follow the show (there is A LOT going on!!!)  Both the books and the show have a lot of characters and both jump back and forth between them all.  So far the books haven't helped me clear things up much.  He talks a lot about different characters with long names, from different houses, and is descriptive with their house sigils, but to me it seems like kind of useless info.  Many of the people he talks of have very little importance to the story (IMO).  It seems like there is much more action/interesting things happening in the show than in the book.  Also the characters are more developed on the show than in the book.  Usually I find the books better than the movies, but not so in this case.  Maybe if I had read them before watching the series I'd have a different opinion.  That being said, I still enjoy the books and will probably read them again.
B0081336FO|5.0|It takes you a while to really get into this show, but once you're in, you're hooked.  Watching Sherlock solve crimes was amazing, but the better part of the plots was watching him learn to interact with other people in pleasing ways - and to learn what it means to have friends.<br />Can't wait for the third season!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Very enjoyable game, with just a couple items to note.  First, the game does load on a Kindle Fire HD.  However it takes a while, and the whole time all you see is a dark screen, or one with just a symbol on it.  Second, I found the scenes to be very dark.  I had to turn up the brightness to its highest level in order to see everything.  I don't like straining to see the visuals of the games I play.  Lastly, the whole premise behind the game is to find a way out of the room.  Once you do that, the game is over.  Don't expect lots of fanfare at that point, or you'll be disappointed.  Overall, I was NOT disappointed, and really loved this game.  It was well worth the money.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Very fun and exciting.  Great plot with twists and action and of course the acting is superb.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|One of the finest Series I have ever seen.  The two stars are excellent in their roles.I plan to order more of the Series to enjoy soon.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great characterization it really draws you into the series and by the end of the book you're already rooting for your favorite.
B009P13RQY|5.0|I love this genre.  I'm not even sure what to call it - it's got a touch of the stoner rock sound (a la Kyuss, QotSA) some of the rock revival sound (a la Wolfmother) that makes me think of old Black Sabbath... it's got great lyrics and content, and a sort of epic rock sound.  I highly recommend this!
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|excellent entertaining movie. Great actors too, especially Harrison Ford.One you can watch, file away for awhile, and watch again, and enjoy it some more.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Loved this book! Had so many moments when your jaw just drops or it makes you want to throw the book.
B009YU9J0E|3.0|I was a big fan of I and II, but III doesn't quite live up to my expectations.  It's not bad, exactly, but it just didn't hook me like I and II did.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|While I din't think this book was as good as the first, it was still great.  It's not very often that you can get educated on a subject while enjoying it so much.  I've been a big fan of Follett since Pillars Of The Earth and now I'm an even bigger fan.
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|Very entertaining.  Marvelous dancers. The plot is thin, but it is most enjoyable to see Baryshnikov at his best.performance in a movie
B002WY65VU|5.0|It is hilarious and well done. There are some gruesome scenes but as long as you know it's not a PG movie it's fantastic.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|Some feel that there's a need for bands to move on, try different things.  I am not one of those people.  I like the QotSA sound, and Like Clockwork sticks to the successful formula of past albums.  If you like their other work, you'll like this one.  I don't think I'd put it up with Rated R or Songs for the Deaf, but it's very good, and I need to give it as many listens as those albums before I come down with a final score.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun puzzle game.  Not too difficult bug challenging enough to keep you interested and wanting to move forward. And then when you're stuck the progressive hints are perfect.  Graphics are very good.  Looking forward to the next room.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Very entertaining, and quite shocking. The actors are excellent. The ending is expecially jolting. A new version has been made, but I doubt that the choice of actors they made can come close to these Classical Actors.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It is a wonderful app for a fun game.  Just need more free coins!  Also some better instructions on the social part (gifts, requests, etc)
B00136JOVG|5.0|I have been listening to Billy Joel for years and this pretty much has every song I could have asked for (and a few I don't care for, but the balance makes it worth it).
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I downloaded this as a free app of the day, but soon found myself never touching it again.  Many of the puzzles are color based.  I am color deficient.  That leaves me with no way to solve them.  I spend more time trying to figure out where I could click and trying to click the known hot spots than I did solving puzzles.  You don't want this game.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Simple enjoy Bingo, really a fun game!  Some Bingo online aren't as fun, but truly enjoy this one.  Play almost daily.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Characters, dialogue, story telling, costumes, scenery, cars, etc.....all very engaging and entertaining.  Like a good book, it is hard to stop watching...
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This app is fantastic. My Kindle's Youtube does not work properly, After hours of searching for a good app that would work best for me I finally stumbled onto VTube. It's great, very good!! The only thing I could think that is a flaw would just be a small improvement. In my opinion they should also allow you to see the Users Name and also go onto their channel. Other than that this app is worth downloading. Good luck!! :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. You take care of your horse, enter competitions, and other things! Its just like owning your own horse!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Finally a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie!!  About time I think!!

I have no problems using it on my iphone but when I try and pin on my kindle 9 out of 10 times it says &quot;force close&quot; ughhhh! I really do love the app and would love to be able to use it on my kindle as well! please fix!!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This was a new twist, with an air of light-heartedness, to a much used genre. It was humorous and appropriate for family viewing. I especially liked the idea of a zombie falling in love with its food source -- what a conflict of interest. I recommend this for those interested in &#34;Zombie Rights.&#34;
B00632HWOG|5.0|Always loved yahoo mail. I mean come on. What's not to love? Been a customer for 10 years give or take.
0770437400|4.0|Where can I get the T-Shirt?<br /><br />\\"Most people see VC Day as the true end\\" of the war against zombies.<br /><br />This book is much better than expected.  It helps that I don't think about Brad Pitt or Hollywood at all when I read this tale about fighting evil as what we call \\"zombies.\\"  It fills in some of the blanks in other zombie media products like the highway scene in the Season Premiere of Season 2 of The Walking Dead.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|its catchy however. you get a lil bored after awhile.<br />I recommend. they implament mini challenges!  like esspecialy with the turtle's!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent book! I literally had a hard time putting it down. Definitely will read this one over and over. Enjoy!
B00A11AN6O|3.0|Its OK I can't load the drive to my computer because I have windows xp. That's the only thing I don't like.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great way to monitor how much battery power I have. I also like it that you can customize the colors if you like a particular colour scheme. Would highly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this for keeping my brain thinking. Also a great way to pass the time.  I can spend hours doing this and not realize it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|At first it was a little hard to get into but, it got really good. Extremely realistic and not some cheesy sci-fi. It give different view points and, it is what would happen if there was a zombie apocalypse. How the different countries governments would react, where the survivors would go, if we really could survive. I was really impressed with this book
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is very entertaining and I always find myself watching \\"just one more episode\\"! Can't wait until the next season!
B008XG1X18|4.0|My granddaughter has used this web site for sometime and really likes it. So do I.  And I will continue to use it.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Really fascinating book, I couldn't put it down. I was almost sad to finish it. Kiedis has a really great memory and very graphically recollects much of his very interesting and disturbing life. Must read, especially for you RHCP fans out there.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It was better than the movie. lots of detail you don't see or notice in the movie. Overall great classic read
B00000F5KH|1.0|I was expecting the movie itself; instead I got a discussion on the movie.  The whole movie is there (visual portion) but the soundtrack consists of a discussion by cinema critics.  I expected to get the original soundtrack of the movie in Portuguese, with English subtitles.  That's the movie I saw in the theater many years ago.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love this show, wish there where more in the series. Can anyone tell me how many seasons there are for this show?
0689835604|5.0|Without a doubt, this is a must have board book for any baby.  Both of my sons (17 months and 4 years) truly LOVED this book and learned many body parts.  My youngest son is a little too obsessed with finding belly buttons, often pulling up my shirt at inappropriate times.  Seriously though, this is my go to book for new babies.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Great cast, quirky and funny but also very cheesy. Stallone's still got it. If you grew up with these action hero's, it's kind of a must see, but don't expect anything super epic.
B006S01GH2|5.0|This movie I love. It always helps me remember the antics I did when I was a child.  I especially connect with Amelie liking to put her hands in sacks of grain.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|My laptop went out, I used an old monitor and a desktop along with this arm for my desk, works really good.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found the book engaging but felt the style and plot used gimmicks more than style. I'm sure many people enjoyed it but I just didn't like the characters or style.
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|Not as good as Live Free or Die Hard but it is still awesome. Bruce Willis still has it and Jai Courtney is fantastic to look at. The &#34;bad guy&#34; was kind of a let down but it still has great action.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Buddy Guy is Jimi Hendrix . . . on Quaaludes.  He makes it look (sound) easy because it comes naturally from this black gentleman. Even if his struggles now have evolved into finding ways to spend his money, and still maintain street cred.
B000003N7K|5.0|Music should transport the listener to a place that is pure pleasure and peaceful bliss, and the rich combination of Hartman and Coltrane, along with his band, deliver an experience that changes the raging world we live in today, into one of love and harmony.<br /><br />  Ok, ok, I'm writing this review in the middle of yet another listen to this smooth, soothing masterpiece, but hey, it has to be the most wonderfully lovely recordings I own.<br /><br />  I have always been a fan of all the styles of Trane, but when I first heard the baritone of Hartman combined with that tenor sax, I was instantly hooked on this amazing album!  How Hartman has gone all these years not being more well known is one of the great mysteries to me, for sure.<br /><br />  Make no mistake in missing out on this album, get it, put it in the player, and then curl up with a good pair of headphones and enjoy the peaceful journey, and expect to revisit that journey many times over...:)
B00ECUARO8|5.0|i highly recommend it! this is a mystery with a mark twain feel. there is something for everyone in this film.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Amazing cast, great storyline, lots of action. It's like a modern day Jesse James meets Good Will Hunting. LOVED IT!
B00931JMRE|5.0|Same old freight train delivery.  A signature sound that no one can mistake but still, the same old stuff.  Oh btw, it's still the best around~!
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first book and watching the movie, I eagerly borrowed this as a Amazon Prime Member and read it when I could before bed and on weekends. Action packed and leaves you wanting more.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|WARNING : once you watch any episode you will be addicted and will not be able to stop.... EVER.<br /><br /> This show is more addicting than meth itself !!
B0057F869U|5.0|Simple, elegant, moving, dark, stunning. Overall a work of art in motion picture form. If you love period films, this one is a must!
B00899E5B4|5.0|This is a very clean (even boring) series of songs regarding how ordinary our hero's life is after all. The surprisingly bright riffs are all over this latest contribution.  It's all good except Joe could use a good Bernie Taupin.
B004YRSBTW|1.0|The film is a masterpiece at psychological manipulation.  The acting is great as was the cinematography.  The film ends abruptly without closure.  It's as if they ran out of film, finances or time.  No one can determine the story because of broken timelines, flashbacks, fake or real memories.<br /><br />On IMDB the discussions draw no conclusion.  No one can be certain for sure what happened or if anything happened.<br /><br />If you like being brain-played then go ahead and waste your money.<br /><br />It made the Nolan's rich.<br /><br />Would not recommend buying.  It is not in the same class as Sixth Sense or others mentioned in other reviews.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Breaking Bad; get it, watch it, love it.<br /><br />How can something so bad be so good ?<br /><br />Watch it and find out
B000I9U972|5.0|I had to buy it on video. It never gets old. I'm really confused by all of the one star ratings. I cant believe there are people that dont get it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is very great. I highly reccomend it for kids of all ages. Even though everything is square and blocky it makes it easier to build. Although it is $7.00 it is still an excellent game, worth the money. This never closes me out on my cell phone, but if you have a kindle/tablet, just experiment. Once again, an amazingly high-tech game.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|If large numbers of people read this, then changes could be forced upon this industry.  I am not saying there is a conspiracy and miracle cures are being withheld. That is not the case. But they do engage in dishonest and underhanded practices to protect their vast profits. A simple example is the quoting of how much it costs to bring a new drug to market. They conveniently forget to tell you that they spend vastly more on advertising - both to patients where permitted, and to doctors.  Indeed the lack of further education of GPs is of real concern. They should not be relying on drug peddlers for scientific knowledge.
B003274QH6|5.0|Breaking Bad; Buy it, watch it, and love it.<br /><br />Breaking Bad is so good; its bad.<br /><br />WARNING: you will be hooked !!
B00DURILJ2|5.0|Such a good movie! Wish it was a book to begin with so I could get more story! Will definitely watch again:)
B001B6EAOY|5.0|It is flimsy but it does indeed fulfill its purpose. but once two memory cards are inserted it retains somewhat sterdiness
B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|I really like this album. I just think the one just before this was better.  I think this album could have more rockabilly tunes on it.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Breaking Bad; get it, watch it, love it. How can something so bad be so good ?<br /><br />Watch it and find out !!
B002XXNSF6|5.0|A beautifully photographed story of young spontaneous attraction. A smart movie for people looking for a great story with no explosions, car chases, or space ships
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Come get the best game ever. My favorite part is when your ziplineing or running on the bricks/wood best ever
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Game is interesting and fun . I think I would enjoy it more if it was more challenging.  I agree that the graphics are for a younger set.  Played to keep me busy.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have really enjoyed this app for the last two years.  I like that you can set a sleep timer and that you can hear stations around the world.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I tried,stick cricket and thought it was good so decided to give this a try. The game has me coming back for more almost everyday. Love the rackets that can be purchased in game, can see a difference when I use them. Actually want to get better when I lose . Thumbs up to developers.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It's a dictionary<br />It's a dictionary<br />Nerds that would want to read the dictionary!!! Duh nerdy people :b ha ha ha
B007SY3CEW|2.0|so that we could play more music. Was not impressed with the full version, the songs are either really simple or extremely difficult. I am a pianist and some of these songs are just really difficult to play on a kindle. Maybe less notes to hit at once, or music that is of medium difficulty range.
B004FOA84A|2.0|A fun little puzzle game, but the whole game takes just a couple of hours to complete. The low rating is because it is so short and because it's no fun to go back and replay (you already know all of the answers to the various puzzles/problems),
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|It is what it is.  Pure fun.  With lots of action.  A total escape from reality.  They did explain a few mysteries.  No I know whats up with Snake Eyes.
B008Y73940|4.0|Good actors, entertaining story and some fun twists at the end. You might predict it if you try but I didn't.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The music goes through me, the acting and the actors are fantastic!  Their singing fits them and their rolls perfectly...
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Great movie form TC.  Wonderful cinematography, great music, and a haunting voice over from Tom C. I would love the soundtrack to include that voice over telling us the story while listening to M83 music.<br />Beautiful scenery and a very compelling story. I recommend it very much.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|It was a good book.  disappointed in ending. Learned a lot about the India way of living in Bombay .  Good.
B000GOTESO|1.0|The acting was bad, the plot was bat and it was a waste of time.  Would not watch it agian if they paid me.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|It was well written and took me on a journey to the stars.  I'd recommend this to anyone.  A good read.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|\\"Elysium\\" is great! This is how the story goes: In the year 2159, two classes of people exist: the very wealthy, who live on a pristine man-made space station called Elysium, and the rest, who live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. The people of Earth are desperate to escape the planet's crime and poverty, and they critically need the state-of-the-art medical care available on Elysium - but some in Elysium will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve their citizens' luxurious lifestyle. The only man with the chance bring equality to these worlds is Max, an ordinary guy in desperate need to get to Elysium. With his life hanging in the balance, he reluctantly takes on a dangerous mission - one that pits him against Elysium's Secretary Delacourt and her hard-line forces - but if he succeeds, he could save not only his own life, but millions of people on Earth as well.<br /><br />The cast led by Matt Damon (as Max) & Jodie Foster (as Delacourt) is great. The directing & story & screenplay by Neill Blomkamp is great.<br /><br />The music by Ryan Amon is great. The cinematography by Trent Opaloch is great. The film editing by Julian Clarke & Lee Smith is great. The casting by Francine Maisler is great. The production design by Philip Ivey is great. The art direction by Nancy Anna Brown (also did the set designs), Ross Dempster, Don Macaulay & Hania Robledo is great. The set decoration by Peter Lando, set designs by David Clarke & Syd Mead, set dressings by Guy Roland, Liz Medrano, Cody Larson & Patrick Kearns is great. The costume design by April Ferry is great. The special make-up effects supervised by Joe Dunckley & the prosthetic make-up effects supervised by Sarah Rubano are great. The special effects coordinated by John MacCuspie & Cameron Waldbauer & supervised by Richard Taylor is great. The visual effects coordinated by Brendan Byrd, Anita Ho, James Greig, Vivien Hulbert, Ciril Koshyk, Claudia Li, Jaydene Maryk & Curtis Tsai & supervised byMark Breakspear, Peter Muyzers, Erik Nordby & Stephen Pepper is great. The stunts coordinated by Mike Mitchell is great.<br /><br />This is a great action-packed sci-fi ride that is entertaining and well-made, as well as, well-done. It is also intriguing and interesting, as well. It is also, visually and thematically, great. This is a great follow-up for Neill Blomkamp after his debut with \\"District 9\\". Matt Damon is great as usual as Max & Jodie Foster is solid as Delacourt, while Sharlto Copley (as Kruger, reuniting with his \\"District 9\\" director) gives a great performance, as well. This is one of the best films of the summer season and one of the best action sci-fi films of the year, so far.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thought it was a great show.  Looking forward to 4th season. Was disappointed in the characters that are not going to be on show next year.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Ok it starts out semi-decent, but then it takes a sharp nose dive south. This book is sooo middle school drama it's appalling. I am serious the girls are juvenile, spoiled brats even going so far as to hit and bite the guys in anger. They break up with the guys for the most silly and outrageous things if one of the guys says he likes the color blue and his girlfriend disagrees she will burst into tears and run away...yah it's that bad! The steamy scenes are boring, underwhelming, and basically don't blink or you will miss them. The guys come across as whipped and pathetic. I am new to this author maybe she put out some other better books but this one is awful. I wanted to throw my ipad across the room i got so frustrated with this book. i just started skipping pages to get to the end. Don't waste your time or money.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|I love this movie and have watched it 3 times so far and can watch it again.<br />It was not only entertaining but also expemplifying!
B0006AAS5G|5.0|It took me a while to decide to purchase this watch because of the negative reviews, but I'm glad I purchased it. The tightening of the crown was tricky at first but once I read the owners manual I was fine. For the money it was worth the price.
0316019984|5.0|This is an awesome product, it is just like advertise. It include everything in the original package. My Kids love it!!!
B00634GHJA|1.0|At this time I've not been able to download the app to my PC, so I can't really rate it.  If I could get it loaded, I would edit the rating.  I don't know who to contact to see if I can get it going on the PC, any help would be appreciated.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Presented largely in the first person, we get inside the head of former first chair DA Andy Barber,  who throughout this novel is on the witness stand for what we don’t learn until the bitter end.<br /><br />Andy’s son has been accused of murdering a classmate by stabbing him and coolly continuing on to school for the day.  It’s an unlikely scenario, and another suspect had emerged; but the investigators had tunnel vision in pursuing this case against Andy’s son Jacob.<br /><br />Mother Laurie seems to be the glue that holds this family together throughout the book.  She learns of Andy’s concern that he carries “the murder gene” and has passed it on to his son.  This revelation erodes their marriage, which is already rocky with the knowledge that their son has been charged with murder, and Dad has been suspended with pay from his position for the duration of the trial.<br /><br />Author William Landay presented this so realistically that I wasn’t surprised to learn that he had actually been a DA and really knows the inner workings of our court system.  This is Mr. Landay’s  third novel, and I do plan to seek out the first two!<br /><br />Gripping drama, twists and turns to the end, make this a great read, hard to put down.  I loved it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Best device out there for Netflix with tons more potential.  The device is very easy and simple to use.  It's loads almost instantaneously unlike other device's that you need to power on and wait for the interface to load.  I highly recommend Chromecast to anyone.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This is an awesome product, it is just like advertise. It include everything in the original package. My Kids love it!!!
B001EC3JME|4.0|This holster started out pretty stiff at first but it's stretched a bit after prolonged use. Even so, it still holds my flashlight well and seems pretty secure. It stretches to fit a variety of flashlights but I'd imagine something like a mini-mag lite might not feel as secure in this particular holder.<br /><br />The swivel holster also can allow you to turn your light into a belt mounted hands-free light though in practical terms, it's significantly more awkward than using a head lamp.<br /><br />I'd also recommend against this holster if you looking for on that completely prevents it from coming out without your permission. It has no latch or buckle to manually secure it in place so it is held in entirely by compression and friction. If you do something where you find yourself working over people's heads or at great heights (or upside down for that matter), you may want to look for a holster that includes some sort of top buckle or clip.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a great game.  It keeps you interest and I love the music playing while you're working the game.  I am definitely addicted!  So very happy that I purchased this edition of Mahjong.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|this is a great application it keeps a music lover like me well entertained and now i don't have to search forever for my favorite songs.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This is an awesome product, it is just like advertise. It include everything in the original package. My Kids love it!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It is jus lik the card game is good for people who kno how 2play the card game is for mature people need facebook for some features
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I loved the game so much and complete it over and over again. This is one of the best games I've played. Keep up the good work. By the way you should add a luxury tab, just my opinion.
1401938906|5.0|The  book is  uplifting. I've  read  it  in  one  day. Many  good  advice. I  really  enjoyed  reading  it. Different  from  the  books  of  the  same  subject.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is an awesome product, it is just like advertise. It include everything in the original package. My Kids love it!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|LIked the way that the author set up the story. I instantly did not like the main character. However, the  content became very dark and twisted. It was okay,but not my usual read.
B00BFV1JZI|5.0|Loved it couldn't put it down and read the 3 within one month which is a world record for me
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game, and with so many ways to vary it, it keeps the challenge going. We can't wait to get the expansion packs!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|This is an awesome product, it is just like advertise. It include everything in the original package. My Kids love it!!!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This movie is pretty good. It does make you do a lot of thinking and wondering. It did make me question a lot of things while watching it and it will leave you hanging on the edge of your seat at times.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|Love the lay out (similar to iphone's ibooks) and I love how I can literally create my own &quot;books&quot; on any subject I want and back up the data as well. However I would love to see more font options, more book covers, I dont like the book covers with the windows since the books I tittle do not appear on the windows, just get rid of the windows. And I would love to see a flipping page animation, that would be neat. A couple of bugs worth mentioning...words that are correctly spelled but not recognized by the the Kindle's dictionary remain underlined in red which is extremely annoying. And when I try to hilight a sentence to underline it or bold the text, the hilight sliders become unresponsive. This is why I cant give it a 5.
B00B0A5XQU|4.0|I love the way the author draws you into her character's lives. Good, easy read. My first Debbie Macomber book.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|have my own dvd of this movie, use kindle when out and about. have had friends say not as good as stage version, and not as good as vegas version? don't know about all that, just know I really like the movie, love the music.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|If you are a Transformer fan and have not seen this then it is a must see. Love the special effect!
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|HE'LL YEA I LOVE THIS GAME. ITS LITTLE MISSIONS, RANDOM WEAPONS, THE PHYSICS ARE EXCELLENT AND SO ARE THE GRAPHICS.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great book! Very twisted and evil. Gillian Flynn is s great author. I've read this book and Gone Girl and I must say they're the best yet!
0375413405|5.0|The book is perfect, for the beginners and for advanced users.<br />It is like a bottle of wine that became much better each day.<br />It is a good investment.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|An appealing and exciting series with various excellent directors.  It is<br />difficult to tire of!!  Blu - ray makes it even better.  Think 3D!!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Personally I had to buy the full version of this app just because of the amount of joy it brought to my young daughter. I know that with this app she is having a great, fun-filled educational experience while smiling and laughing all of the way. As a parent, I love to play along with her so I can work with the app to give her the best educational experience she could have from a phone app.  We love building baby animals together and the app provides a great opportunity for us to bond together, father and daughter. Highly recommend buying the full version as it is helpful to ANY and ALL parents.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Since starting the wheat free diet my morning blood glucose has dropped example yesterdays was 98  it would have been 130 or higher  blood pressure down energy up  still have not had wheat since june  aint to hard to stay wheat free and if you like beer try red bridge  i would drink it even if i were not wheat free
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I've watched all the episodes and hoping for more. Watched Season 2 in a weekend. Wanted more. I hope there are more seasons to come!  And I hope Mr. Timmons comes back home.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|Damian Stevenson has written a detailed guide to the film Scarface that sheds some light on where the story came from and why the film became so popular after its release. It's a well written account which Scarface lovers will definitely enjoy. This book really opened my eyes to the sense of mistrust felt by Cubans in Miami when the film was being made there. The fact that the filmmakers were 'driven out of town' made me realize how seriously the film was taken at the time. I just know I'm going to enjoy watching Scarface even more the next time I see it after reading this well researched account.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best free game I have ever played! It even asks your age so that it knows the difficulty level. It's amazing.
1449437524|5.0|I love the Oatmeal and even though this book is only one comic, it's still very sweet. I recommend his books and his online comics.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I think this game is amazing. if you like drastic park its perfect. you should play it(if you like darasic<br /> park )
B00821OX98|5.0|My wife started watching this after it was already in its third season, and ended up liking it so much better than many other science fiction series attempts that she has now gone back through the first two seasons to catch up on everything. Good characterizations, and rarely any plot holes that frequently happen on TV shows, where not too much care is usually given to story lines.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I was ok, slow to but ready to use.<br />Just thought out was easy really good there should be a number two
B001IF277K|5.0|The battery was exactly like original, hope it last as long.  Was charged and ready to go right out of package.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Once you start watching this documentary, you cannot stop.  My husband and I watched it once, but we are going to watch it over and over again.  We are sure we missed some things and the music is fantastic.  We have loved the Eagles from the beginning of their career and still follow them.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Well actually by the fourth film quite a lot of people can hear screaming.... The films look beautiful in this transfer, the sound is great, and while most of the special features have been released on other sets, they are great to have on blu. Must buy!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|It is worthy to download it here at Amazon and it works as a real time connection tool. Works like expected.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW. AND I LOVE IT I CAN'T SEEM TO PUT IT DOWN.
B00CBRI9G2|2.0|Waste of time. Don't bother renting it unless it ends up bring free. Even for free I wouldn't watch it again.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|The $100 Startup is the perfect mix of inspiration (others have done it and so can you), and practical advice (here's exactly what to do). My advice is to rad the book before you need what's contained within, and then take action now on building an income stream so you can live the life you want to live ASAP.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Neat game ..I haven't seen the movie yet but now I'm going to have to LOL. Completing quest is quite simple . Cool music.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Another great one by Kate Morton! Laughed, cried, and read some parts as fast as I could due to the suspense. Transports you into the Riverton world.
B001NHNG64|4.0|His books are hard to put down, but it seems they have the same trail.  He doesn't want to do anything except travel to see the states when along comes this woman and he is just dragged along for the ride.  I do have my next book ready to continue on this ride, oh well.
B00BG4UWPC|4.0|Bankrupt is a  very good album.  I am a avid Phoenix fan since Wolfgang Amadeus ..the best of their albums.  After listing many times  to Bankrupt I feel this album comes close to Wolfgang Amadeus..Phoenix was amazing at Lolapolza in Chicago last week.  !
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Quite enjoyable, without getting boring. Is good for continuous gameplay &amp; short runs, and doesn't get addictive. I am a big fan and I highly recommend it!
B002BVQU5A|5.0|Every character plays their role perfectly. What a great job all the way around. I recommend it to everyone. Michael
1451695195|4.0|The story is very believable and is enhanced by the explanations of the various parts of the brain and their functions. Being a follower of modern Saints, such as Padre Pio, and his commentaries about aspects of heaven, such as angels,coinsides with the author's narative of being taken by the hand by a being.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I never can wait for the next James Rollins story.  I enjoyed the variety of backdrops ( Mongolia, Macau, North Korea, etc.) as well as the reintroduction of previous characters (other than the usual) such as Monsignor Verona and his niece Rachel.  However, the new guy with the &#34;magnetic fingers&#34; was a bit much.

0670026638|5.0|I literally think that it is the greatest book written this year. People can argue with me all they want, but that is just my opinion. I realized half way into reading it that it is an adult book except I am a teenager....but I still loved it.<br /><br />The plot is amazing, the characters have lots of personalities and tell the story really well. Ruth writes the most beautiful story.<br /><br />Recommend it to everyone, even teens!! :D

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I was looking to borrow some kindle books for my 7 year old from my local library.  When I went to the library's website, I saw this book and read the excerpt.  I thought it sounded like a good book, so I checked it out.  In fact, I thought it sounded like a book I would like to read, so I told my daughter she couldn't read it by herself, but had to wait for my husband and I to read it with her.  The book did not disappoint.<br /><br />We first started to read the book at the kitchen table after we ate supper.  I honestly didn't think my 5 year old son would sit while we were reading the book.  But he sat asking questions and listened.  My daughter was also listening.  They sat interested the whole time.  My daughter, husband, and myself take turns reading the book and my son listens each and every time.  We are not done with the book yet (we've been reading for about 3 weeks).  It is a long book especially when you only read a little bit each day.  The kids even ask to read a chapter or two before bed time.<br /><br />The book also teaches good lessons.  My daughter was playing with a kid that she just became friends with.  The friend was picking on my son and so then did my daughter.  My husband ask, are you being mean to your brother because it is easier to pick on him like your friend rather than stick up for him.  Isn't that what Jack Will was doing to August in the book?  She had an \\"Aha\\" moment and realized what she was doing.  She then stuck up for her brother.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Young love! We have all been there. And all those feelings come crashing back reading this story.<br />Of course Travis and Abbie have their own unique twist in their lives. Making for a roller coaster of events. Like the song says, this is what get when a tornado meets a volcano. Even though Abbie hides her true self in most the book, you can still see through her calm before the storm, she holds inside.

B006IYG5HE|4.0|While the book is confusing at some points, it was worth it to finish.  I don't care about the accuracy of the death penalty in Africa, and moslem holidays because it didn't really affect the story.  He's a great writer, and I, like others, started with the SNOWMAN, and was glad to see more of his writing come our way.  He definitely should keep writing.

B00E8S2JZ4|2.0|When the Lord of the Rings Trilogy was in full swing, I remember being captivated from the first moments for its cinematic excellence on all fronts -- the characters, the story, the scenery, etc., and loved it all. When I finally had the opportunity to watch The Hobbit, I was very disappointed; I was confused by how disjointed the movie is. It starts out as sort of a Hobbit: The Musical and introduces us to the main cast of characters, none of whom really distinguish themselves enough for me to identify their personalities. The adventure has a slow start and never gained enough steam to keep me interested. Even the special effects, which were so seamless in the LOTR trilogy, didn't have the same quality. I have not read Tolkein's The Hobbit, so maybe I would have enjoyed this movie more if I had, but I hadn't read The Fellowship of the Ring when I first saw that adaptation, and was able to love it. In the end, the lack of depth in this movie plays off as a gimmicky version of what should be a classic, and is not.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is probably the best game ever on kindle. Me and my sister play it all the time.This game is a must get.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I am so annoyed by this book, and I really cannot figure out why people liked it!<br /><br />The story is totally frustrating, I found myself thoroughly annoyed with the characters and the author, and in the end I was royally pissed off. I did not like anyone, and did not care what happened anymore. I had to force myself to finish it, and then found the ending even more frustrating.<br /><br />This book is really well written, and at first I was involved trying to figure out what happened. However, then I just could not stand the story. Talk about narcissistic personalities, and at the end of a novel I want something to have grown or change, and this one did not do anything. Just left me feeling trapped and dirty, as the main character did.
141659521X|4.0|This book is a page turner.  However, I didn't give it 5 stars because the author didn't know how to end it.  All the loose ends were tied up too neatly and too quickly
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy this game so much it's hard to put down.  Graphics are good as well as sound. Awesomely entertaining.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|While the author purports to be writing a historical account relatively  stripped of religious bias, I have read much better historical accounts that have been truer to that purpose., They remain closer to history and minimize religion as their substance for their conclusions.  Reading this account the author's opinions are fine but they are opinions and not necessarily historical facts of the life and beliefs as he promotes through his theses., He did propose alternate concepts in his addenda,often not in his work, which promotes a bias unless one reads every single note of his addenda.  He does indeed state that their are alternate interpretations but, in general, his work puts forward only one directed conclusion:  his
0345803485|1.0|Without doubt, the worst written and most immature \\"novel\\" I have ever come across. Curiosity is fueling lots of readers. All I can say is I'm glad I didn't buy it... but was persuaded to borrow and read! Puerile, laughable...the same phrases repeated throughout with gob-smacking frequency. Non-erotic sex scenes with no sense of the magic and mystery of sexual passion. References to idiotic \\"sub-conscious\\" and \\"inner-goddess\\" personae (!), the protagonist \\"flushing\\" and biting her (erotic) lip constantly, and she can't even call genitals by name, instead there are the incessant references to \\"down there!\\" How old is E.L. James, for God's sake?<br />Like other reviewers, I also thought this must surely have been written by an adolescent, and one without a good command of English! I agree with the person who said that the first few chapters made her want to gouge her own eyes out! Yes indeed! This is gouge-worthy reading at its worst. One star is really a generous rating for such poor quality prose, laughably lame story line and characters so hollow, who cares about them anyway?!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|My best friend and I are addicted. A riveting show that will certainly grab your attention! For people who enjoy history and period time pieces, this is the perfect show for you. An amazing cast, an amazing attention to visual detail and a story line that just couldn't be made up! A small warning though.... it is NOT suitable for children.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|The price is great and I like the sound very much and I would purchase another if I had to.does great job on PlayStation
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a thought provoking novel. It relates to murders in our world and asks the question &#34;Are murderers born or nurtured to be as they are?&#34; It is a question left unanswered at the end of the story, but one that rings in my head still.

1439181780|5.0|Excellent book! So insightful and I wouldn't go into a new career nor new relationship without reading this book first & you have to get this book if you've been laid off from your job or are experiencing any negative things that you have no control over like breaking off an engagement, relationship issues, not receiving the promotion at work that you know you deserve, while someone less qualified gets in instead of you. This is a &#34;must read!:

If it helps him, it will be the best investment I ever made.

B000053VBL|4.0|As goes TCM, so goes my latest kick. Right now I'm immersed in the films of François Truffaut, and that is a hell of a lot of English sub-titles to read. But, okay, who amongst us couldn't do with the occasional dip into artsy-fartsy French cinema? C'mon, man, get your culture on. Eat a snail.His stylish nod to the films of Alfred Hitchcock finds François Truffaut at his least Truffautesque. Chain-smoking pundits in berets and turtlenecks won't be referencing 1968's THE BRIDE WORE BLACK (\\"La Mari&eacute;e &eacute;tait en noir\\") any time soon as what's indicative of the French New Wave movement. Truffaut does make some interesting filmmaking choices but it's a film that's far from a \\"self-conscious rejection of traditional cinema structure,\\" which is the bread and butter of the French New Wave.<br /><br />It's about as close as Truffaut gets to the straightforward suspense thriller. In it we see Jeanne Moreau's character embark on a dark vengeful road. Julie Kohler (Moreau) seeks the deaths of the five men who killed her husband on her wedding day. Because what else is there to do once one mucks up one's suicide? I don't know that Truffaut intends the film audience to sympathize with Julie Kohler, although, okay, there is one instance in which she deliberately calls the police to clear the schoolteacher arrested for a murder Kohler had committed. But while we do catch fleeting glimpses of a shattered Julie Kohler, for the most part Moreau plays her as an enigmatic femme fatale, emotionless and methodical and utterly purposeful in her quest. Only ever dressed in stark black and white, she gives off this impersonal Angel of Death vibe. There's a fatalistic pulse and a sense of melancholia that grips you, even as that same melancholia eludes our lethal black widow. We never catch the sense that Moreau's character will reconsider and step away from her compulsion for revenge. It doesn't matter at all that several of her targets aren't entirely unsympathetic.<br /><br />For someone like me, who hasn't seen too many of Truffaut's works, THE BRIDE WORE BLACK serves as a sort of primer. There's enough jarring stuff in there, enough unconventional storytelling and artistic conceits in there, that it works to set me up for Truffaut's other, more New Wavy stuff. As a fan of Hitchcock, I appreciate the film for its suspenseful components and visual flair. Bernard Herrman's lush score accentuates the mood and stresses those ties to Hitchcock. At no moment was I ever perfectly at ease in the company of Julie Kohler. But I admit to a fascination in watching her story unfold. THE BRIDE WORE BLACK is a study in repression and cold, calculating revenge and things inevitably set into motion. Word is that Truffaut wasn't happy with the end result, but I put that down to his being French. 3.5 out of 5 stars.or someone like me, who hasn't seen too many of Truffaut's works, THE BRIDE WORE BLACK serves as a sort of primer.

0064471837|5.0|If I had access to a Star Trek Holodeck, this would be the first holo-novel I would jump into, quickly followed by Lirael and Abhorsen.<br /><br />The story connected with me on many levels.  Immersive gut wrenching adventure (Sabriel turned to one side, then the other, like a rabbit running from a dog...the Mordicant was only a hundred yards below...Flames were spewing from its mouth and it thrust its pointed head back and howled as it ran).  Filial love (\\"...behind this, there is always love.\\"), which made the story hard to read through my tears.  And of course it's a rip-roaring story of Good versus Evil, told in a way I'd never encountered before, which still shines brightly in my imagination, years after reading it.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this tale to you, as I do to all my friends.  Enjoy!

B0012DK4ZU|4.0|I first saw this film when I was a kid. It was scary then and it is scary now that I am 48. A true classic!
1597801585|3.0|I just finished this book. I'm still thinking about it, so that means the author made an impact. The concept driving the book, that huge corporations in the west inadvertently (or not so inadvertently) unleashed genetically modified food and viruses into the environment that wholly compounded the hell of advanced climate change for a huge portion of the world was fascinating. And believable, especially the part about the corporations and individuals reaping enormous power and profit off of the misery of others (Hello, top 1%!). It took me a good long while to get up to speed because the author drops you into the world with no back story or explanation. You have to piece it together yourself. Once I did, the book became intriguing. The characters didn't, though. Just the depictions of the world itself. The characters were poorly drawn and not well-fleshed out. And there wasn't really anybody to root for. I was particularly disappointed by the title character. As evidenced by the truly awful but lovingly detailed rape and abuse scenes, she seemed to mostly embody some 14 year old boy's sex slave fantasy. Her phenomenal physical abilities don't appear until almost the end of the book. Mostly she is beautiful but passive and pathetic. The only other major female character never really develops either. All that said...if the author writes a sequel, I'm pretty sure I'm going to read it. The world itself, the unintended ramifications of genetically modifying things just because you can, and the end game of global warming makes for pretty compelling reading.
B003U53GK8|5.0|For any lost fan, I would recommend the last season or for anyone who loves twists in a story.<br />This season like all of the other seasons made me go through a range of emotions.<br />I absolutely love the characters and the ending was different than I expected.

B000VZYPB4|5.0|It made me laugh out loud, which is hard for a show to do. I really enjoy the interplay of the characters, and the &#34;slimeball&#34; character, Howie, isn't as off-putting as I was afraid of when I first heard about the series. It is a show about stereotypes, obviously, and I was a little disappointed in how when they shove Penny into the role of caregiver she runs with it. All in all though, the laughs are more than the disppointing parts.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|The story, on its face, draws you in, as love stories do. It goes, however, so much further, delving into the dignity of lifting a quality existence. It explores the courage of choices.

0307352153|5.0|I suspect that when a person is attempting to discover oneself, be it one's purpose in life, sexual orientation, heritage, etc., he or she may live their life in an indeterminable haze, knowing what society appears to deem as \\"correct\\" and that he or she exists in said society, but he or she may not be in unison with society. And then there comes the moment of self-actualization: a sheer force of clarity when an external factor directly defines what a person can be with both simplicity and significance that he or she wonders how they lived their lives without this hand crafted definition of identity.<br /><br />In college, I would go out, but sometimes I would have preferred to stay in and watch a movie or read a book. I tend to live in my own head, a constant stream of thoughts, analysis and interpretations running through my mind. I would rather have an in depth conversation with an individual than attempt to \\"win friends and influence people.\\" But in college you are suppose to go out to parties and bars with loud music and sticky floors. It supposedly is better to voice your opinions then keep everything internal. And as an MBA, I have been instilled with notion that if you are not expanding your personal network, you are not interacting with people correctly.<br /><br />But then here comes Susan Cain, a shaman to the introverted psyche, an envoy from the \\"Recluse\\" Nation, to explain to the world and to ourselves exactly who we are. And I was ecstatic enough to join the ticker tape parade in the streets (if any of our own party should attend). It was like a slap in the face. I am an introvert. I am an introvert AND that is ok. I am an introvert AND that is ok AND there are others like me who have existed and exist from the dawn of man to now. In a world where everything is becoming interconnected, it is important, it is vital, to understand the variance of human personality. There is reform in education and business to help address learning and cultural differences, and it is evident that the missing piece of the puzzle is the broad continuum of personality that differs from individual to individual. It is not feasible or even prudent to allow every person to address education and work and life in general in their own absolute, personalized manner. But instead, books like this and people like Susan Cain bring forth ideas and evidence that societal conformity puts people into \\"one-size-fits-all\\" intangible institutes but that this is not the answer either. There is a happy medium between these two extremes and by acknowledging that there is a potential problem, we can begin developing solutions to address and appease both the introverts and extroverts.<br /><br />Finally, while this is a compelling book and should be required reading for, well, humanity, it only tells one side of the story. I would very much like to read an unbiased sequel (\\"Loud\\" perhaps) that tells the story and virtues of our extroverted citizens of the world. \\"Quiet\\" is an opportunity for both introverted and extroverted people to understand who introverts are. Extroverts may not have a problem with self-identity in this regard, but a book about the mentality and skills and stories of extroverted people will help introverts understand them. Cain talks about how self-help books have changed from a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality and describes the current extroverted world that introverts reside in. But I am sure it was difficult for extroverts to live in an introverted world once upon a time.
0316069884|5.0|Jonathan Safran Foer has a great writing style which makes this book an easy and enjoyable read. I couldn't put the book down. He put years of research and investigation into creating a fact based book with a personal touch. I've read a few books on the same or similar topic, and this one is definitely my favorite.
B005LAII80|5.0|It is surprisingly great movie despite it lacks depth in story.  It have an interesting story and good directing, it have plenty of great, awesome action. The audio is amazing! It kept me entertained. Overall, I enjoyed watching it so far.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good game so far . Challenges are quite easy but still fun and enjoying the collections. Hopefully the story line picks up soon.
1451695195|4.0|If this story is real, it's great news for every good egg out there. If you are not a straight shooter then I suggest you grab a copy of Dante Alighieri's 'The Divine Comedy' . You will not like what you read. Amen. However, Dr. Eben Alexander does say in this stunning book that God loves everybody...but why take a chance, just treat everyone the way you would want to be treated and earn your ticket to the pearly gates. Is there really a spiritual afterlife, or did the good doctor experience a brain fart? I don't know. He did have E.coli bacterial meningitis that basically eats your brain, rendering it kaputs. It's so rare that less than one person in ten million contract it. Usually after several days, the best you can hope for is a vegetative state. Dr. Alexander had it for seven days and fully recovered enough to write this book. Near- death experiences ( NDEs ) are not new, but coming from this previously disbelieving neurosurgeon, it's certainly a significant happening. I think that is what's important. Scientist and academicians have traditionally avoided taking on these issues, with the exception of P.M.H. Atwater's 1988 book 'Coming Back To Life' . Dr. Alexander certainly gave this reader a lot to think about. The reader wants to believe.<br /><br />During Dr. Alexander's seven day coma, his brain wasn't working at all. So the dream or hallucination factor doesn't come into play. The doctor explains... \\" If you don't have a working brain, you can't be conscious. Example-pull the plug, the TV goes dead.\\" So how did he travel to heaven? He awoke in a very dark place with underground roots and strange background music.

The idea behind the production was an act of genius in and of itself: taking the tried and true formula of William Shakespeare's prodigious work known as Romeo & Juliet and adapting it into a modern day setting. Jerome Robbins monumental musical brought forth enough flair in style and heart of wonder to capture the imaginations of even the most cynical of film goers and film critics upon the theatrical release in 1961 and now 50 years ago. There are few films that manage to be so awe-inspiring in scope. West Side Story has the distinction of winning 10 Academy Awards® and including Best Picture, which is the most ever for a film musical.<br /><br />The film lays out some ground rules for the story from the beginning as two rivalling gangs in New York known as the Jets and the Sharks begin to demonstrate their immense displeasure with each other by evoking these negative sentiments with a perfectly choreographed song and dance number. The gang form replicates the original rivalry of Romeo & Juliet found between the Montagues and the Capulets.<br /><br />This is a love story, of course, between two young star-crossed lovers from different backgrounds and who must struggle with the lack of acceptance from those who surround them. Tony [Richard Beymer] was the former leader of the Jets gang, and now he's looking for a brighter tomorrow without gang life interfering with a newfound spirit for renewal and growth. Maria [Natalie Wood] is the beautiful young woman who captures Tony's heart. Maria has inner-beauty that matches her outwardly gorgeous looks and she falls in love with Tony with an equal level of intensity and immediacy. Conflict inevitably arrives when Bernardo [George Chakiris] learns that his younger sister is involved with former Jet leader Tony. Bernardo is the gang leader of the Sharks.<br /><br />The performances in ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ are brilliant and uncannily captivating across the board. Both lead performances by Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer are remarkable achievements. Beymer was cast in one of his most memorable roles of his career and Natalie Wood added another excellent performance to her already long list of achievements (including her child performance in the original ‘Miracle on 34th Street’ and a performance against James Dean in ‘Rebel Without a Cause’). The supporting cast of actors helps the foundation of the film dramatically with great performances by Russ Tamblyn as the new Jet leader Riff (who is close friends with Tony), George Chakiris as Bernardo, and Rita Moreno as Bernardo's feisty and intelligent girlfriend Anita. George Chakiris and Rita Morena both received well deserved Academy Awards for their sensational performances.<br /><br />There are two essential double-bill aspects to ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ that have continued to be so impressive after all of these years following the debut: the collaborations in music that combined the efforts of an undeniably jazz-infused Leonard Bernstein and the up and coming brilliant lyricist Stephen Sondheim, and the directing efforts from both Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins (who also choreographed the film). Robbins deserves the most recognition though, as he conceived of the original play and lent the best of his choreography on a level that had never been captured before and hasn't been since. Either double bill aspect concerning this massive and unrelentingly complicated production is purely wonderful and worthy of acclaim. The music sweeps viewers off their feet and captures the essence of romance and love while the energetic, stylish direction and the majority of which was done by Robert Wise, and choreography done entirely by Jerome Robbins, and brings some of the most captivating cinematic visuals around.<br /><br />Who cannot forget the opening dance number by the Jets, the spinning visual-effects of Maria to a new dance number with countless energetic dancers, the silly rooftop dance that celebrates and critically dissects both the promise and disappointments found by minorities living in America? Attempting to even pick a favourite scene or sequence can lead to some problems: every scene is so beautifully and expertly crafted that it almost seems more appropriate to simply select a personal favourite from the bunch. The mid-way rushing offrantically scattering gang members, the long silence, and the slanted camera-work might be one person’s pick, but how about the simple but elegant dance between Tony and Maria? There are so many perfect moments. The execution of this production is almost flawless.<br /><br />There are some minor detractors as it is hard to imagine new audiences of ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ not having at least some difficulty accepting the fact that Natalie Wood is playing a Puerto Rican. The racial issues are actually inherently important to the story of ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ itself so the unmistakable fact that there is a racial issue in the film is sadly disappointing nonetheless, but for those who can overlook this aspect it should still be worth recognizing that Natalie Wood delivered a fantastic performance that continues to be enchanting. It is important to remember the historical context of when the film was produced within the Hollywood studio system and to appreciate positive elements without overlooking negative drawbacks.<br /><br />The history of this film is so interesting. It was a huge undertaking for everyone involved, most notably Jerome Robbins, who was eventually fired from the film despite being the largest source of its creative energy. The film surprised audiences worldwide. It was such a tremendous hit, and no one expected it to take everything by storm the way it did. The film continues to amaze audiences after half a century. The play version is performed worldwide through schools and theatre production companies. Even for those who haven't seen the film, there is a clear distinction of the importance of ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ and of the music that brought it to life. There is not even a single film out there quite like it and that continues to make it even more special and enduring. ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ is all about love between two unlikely souls, the love for theatre, as represented through this stunning cinematic tour-de-force, and the recognition of the importance of overcoming racial issues and understanding the commonalities between people of different backgrounds.<br /><br />Set to the lush cinematography of Daniel L. Fapp, West Side Story is pretty much as the early advertisements for the film claimed: &#34;As other movies age ... ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ gets younger!&#34; In other words: it's a timeless classic.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ arrives on Blu-ray with an almost immaculate looking transfer – which is great news as it was filmed with 70mm cameras. In one word: incredible. Fans of the film will be hard-pressed to find an element of dissatisfaction. The colours are so vivid; the contrast so accurate, the cinematography brilliant, and the overall feel of the high-quality production is almost perfectly captured. The image clearly hasn't been tampered with by annoying &#34;picture-quality enhancing&#34; shortcuts. Make no mistake: this Blu-ray is the best presentation of ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ on home media. The film is presented in an awesome 1080p encoded image in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.20:1.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – The audio presentation doesn't skimp out on any trimmings either. The film is presented with a glorious 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio presentation that captures the music in all its magnificent glory. The dialogue is also well reproduced on this Blu-ray release and sound directionality is well used for both the score and songs. Other Audio options available as stated above.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Blu-ray Film [1080p] and DVD Bonus [PAL]<br /><br />DISC 1 [Blu-ray]:<br /><br />Special Feature: Comment on the songs by Lyricist Stephen Sondheim: This is somewhat fascinating and somewhat depressing. Steven Sondheim seems to offer a view on his lyrics that is negative, overly harsh, extremely unflattering, and thoroughly interesting all at the same time. He apparently doesn't feel quite as confident in hisown lyrics as his fans do. Sondheim does share a great deal about how or why he created some of the lyrics to his songs and he gives good information about the overall process.<br /><br />Special Feature: Karaoke (Voice Original) Music Machine [1080p] [1:25:07] This is a video jukebox of all the film's musical sequences. Each song/sequence can also be accessed individually.<br /><br />Special Feature: POW! Dances from West Side Story [1080p] [19:00] All new feature in which cast members, contemporary filmmakers, dancers and choreographers analyse and illuminate the film's famous dance sequences. With a fantastic 19 minutes’ worth of footage for 6 specific scenes in the film including Prologue; Dance At The Gym; Tony And Maria's Cha Cha; America; The Rumble and Maria's Roof Dance, and they can also be viewed separately.<br /><br />DISC 2 [DVD]:<br /><br />Special Feature Documentary: Memories of West Side Story [2003] [60:00] This is an original recordings of Natalie Wood, interviews with team members including Robert Wise and Stephen Sondheim. It gives us a broad look at the making of the film and the troubles it went through, including the firing of Jerome Robbins and the replacement of Natalie Wood's vocals with those of Marni Nixon.<br /><br />Special Feature: Storyboard to Film Comparison Montage [4:50] This is a brief but interesting video collection of storyboarded drawings that were used to capture the essence of select scenes or moments before being filmed.<br /><br />Special Feature: Photo Shooting [480i] [4:50] This is a Storyboard to Film Comparison Montage.<br /><br />Theatrical Trailers: Original Theatrical Trailer; Original Issue Trailer; Reissue Trailer and Animated Trailer.<br /><br />BONUS: A Beautiful Designed Exclusive Deluxe Limitied Edition DigiBook. Here you get lots of brilliant stunning Colour and Black-and –White photos and an Introduction by Producer Walter Mirisch. You also get different sections entitled: “LA PETITE HISTOIRE DE WEST SIDE STORY;” “UN FAUTEUIL POUR DEUX;” “BERNADO, TONY ET RIFF;” “MARIA ET ANITA” and “NEW YORK NEW YORK.” [French wording].<br /><br />Finally, ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ is one of the great landmarks of cinema. It is the perfect blend of theatricality and cinematic wonder. The performances amaze, the direction mesmerizes, and the musical songs are totally beautiful and have become classic songs that live forever. ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ is a landmark film which pushed the boundaries of the American musical art form. Five decades later it doesn't just hold up, it stands tall as one of the best movies ever made. This Blu-ray presentation doesn't quite reach those comparatively giddy heights, however. The transfer looks great at times but it's slightly hamstrung by the original printing artefacts, and some modern anomalies have also left their mark. The sound is quite lovely in terms of quality and retains the directional dialogue, but sadly the 7.1 surround field is utterly wasted. The extra features aren't as wide-ranging as one might hope, yet there's just enough here to satisfy. Here be warned about the strange fade to black during the Overture, which maybe was a small mistake that will surely be remedied at some point with another Special Edition. But despite this, with this Blu-ray release, it has made the film look totally fresh, in thinking it was made in the 21st Century, as the filming was so dramatic and with the fantastic cinematography, bring musical score and amazing tuneful songs, this film was worthy of all its plaudits and has now gone pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection. Of course sadly the wording in this DigiBook is all in French, but the colour and black-and-white images make up for it, as well as the brilliant DigiBook luxurious presentation.

B00C5WR6JE|2.0|Was not like anything I thought it would be.  It was written up to be a great CD by a magazine but I would disagree.  Listened to it once, probably won't again.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Not just for the kids! this game is great. Awesome Graphics, really cute &amp; very entertaining.Missions are easy but not boring.
1603427244|5.0|A great little--and I mean that literally--reference for various methods of doing exactly what the title refers to.  I have already tried several bind-offs that I had not used before just for the heck of it.  A useful little volume.
1452123071|5.0|The cartoons on the postcards were great. Hilarious thinking about Vader as a dad to Luke, the one with Lea was even better!
B008RNGCAO|5.0|I was too young to read this and it would've taken a lot of work to try and get each book, not to mention money. This digital version was perfect. It'd greAt knowing I can collect the books but be able to read them on the go.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Watched 4 times and could watch again! Shared with family and they loved it. British movie better than U.S. one.
B007LB5MF4|3.0|I am an enthusiastic comic fan and have been for 50 years.  The art in this book is spectacular.  They just have difficulty keeping the story interesting.  Doesn't translate well from screen to book format for me.
B003O86FMW|3.0|some new twists in the arena..you have to read the third book to see what happens to the heros, if they survive or not
B0079IJ0R0|5.0|I love opera but even newbies to opera will love this version of Carmen.  Great buy for the opera lover and those who want to get their feet wet into the opera world. Elina Garanca brings Carmen to life in a saucy and gritty verson of Bizet's classic...an amazing mezzo soprano. Buy it....a great addition to your BluRay collection.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|THIS APP IS VERY EASY TO USE. I HAVE IT ON MY KINDLE FIRE. IT HAS LARGE BUTTONS AND EASY FUNCTIONS. I WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS APP BEFORE I BOUGHT MY CALCULATOR FOR THE HOUSE. I WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED THAT EXPENSIVE DEVICE WITH ITS TEENY WEENY BUTTONS.
B000IKQMFO|2.0|Gosford Park is a good movie with an excellent cast. However, the DVD was poor because the picture was very dark and hard to view for most of the movie.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|After watching this movie I gave it a 4 star review.. the product arrived on time. I would wait for this movie to come to a redbox if I where you..
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Sometimes you just want to see a good old mystery and I enjoyed this one.  There is somethings that can be said about an arrogant guy.  Life is a hard teacher.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Riveting and shocking. Mesmerizing, amazing, beautiful scenery and music, fabulous acting with lovely British accents, with an incredible ending, really!
B006LSZECO|5.0|enjoy it! I feel it's worth it and her other books Sharp Objects and Dark Places are very good. I look forward to her future books!
B006X5L6VS|1.0|It is not what I expected.  Doesn't tell me what I am looking at in the sky.  I have to rotate the screen by hand to get the stars I want to identify.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I like to take pictures in the dark at night, and this flash takes outstanding night photos. The flash works extremely well for taking indoor and out door pictures.
B007D3WGXQ|5.0|Long time fan of Stephanie Pui-Mun Law, and waited for years for this deck to be published. The art is beautiful, and I have a fun time sharing with friends!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed all three books. 16 more words to say about how this book impacted my life, it made me happy because I love reading.
B00BSBVLF8|1.0|I wasn't sure what to expect. I'd never seen a performance at a show or watched any videos of Cirque  Du Soliel.  Within twenty minutes I switched from watching the rental to bathing my cat. I enjoyed bathing the cat more.  Fortunately she's had her front claws removed.  This artistic expression, combined with the wetness, helped display the suffering of my cat in the bathtub.  The story from the movie was just another retelling of two hearts lost and the bars we swing from because of it. Not my cup of tea.
B0012QTT4O|1.0|WOW!  After watching this on AMC and hearing all sorts of language, I was very surprised to have the F-word bleeped out, especially after the main character just grabbed himself and said shine this!  There is also a scene where a women's breasts are pixeled out.  I'm 52 and feel cheated, I don't want my TV censored and for that I give it 1 star, I could not truly appreciate the show with parts of the dialogue bleeped out.  I seriously doubt that I'll be buying the other seasons via Amazon or if it's all VOD then I'll have to do DVD's or just not bother at all.<br /><br />Amazon should state somewhere that you are buying a censored version, if they had I would not have bothered.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|Good classic American horror that will surely leave you with chills, perfect for a late night date movie to curl up with someone special
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love Despicable Me and love minion rush just as much. It keeps me entertained when I just need a break but the only problem is it's quite addictive!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I literally have an old PC attached to a 42 inch HDTV just so I can watch videos or play games off of it, but its one of those TV's that doesn't quite recognize the PC every time (or even half the time) it starts up so having to remove the HDMI plug and replace it back in to get sound and video to work is a hassle; it also screws with resolution settings reverting them and having to readjust that as well. Once I got chromecast I no longer needed to rely on that PC to watch videos or even bother turning it on anymore, I can sit back and stream it from my Galaxy S3. The amount of power drain from your phone is small, if I were to watch the same videos on my phone it could drain 2-3% of the battery per 30 min video whereas streaming to Chromecast it only drained 1% for 3 videos in all so it's just sending data rather than playing it on both devices.<br /><br />Any device on the wi-fi can connect to the Chromecast, it doesn't need the phone App on all of them just the one that sets up the connection after that the app is no longer needed. We tested every smart phone we have and they all connect to it automatically. For PC/Laptop you do need the Chrome Browser, but what if you don't like using the Chrome Browser? Well there is a way around that, but you still need to use the Chrome Browser as a back drop hiding in a minimized window. Open Chrome, and download the browser app/extension \\"Chrome Remote Desktop\\" with this you can remote into your own PC/Laptop and can be viewed as a direct mirror of sound and video onto the Chromecast. Once you have it setup you can minimize the window and run whatever else you want, from other Browsers, video players like DivX, if you're old fashioned like me play WinAmp, Windows Media Player, your photos, or even PC games. They will all project through the Chromecast as long as the Chrome Browser has the Chrome Remote Desktop actively running. Video games have a slight delay for less video intensive games its hardly noticeable, but for fast pace games it can be pretty annoying like Planetside 2 there's at least a 0.5 second delay on input to video, it gets worse when you have big armies on both ends.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|It a really good story for being free. I am going to read the next story. It's a small-town story were we all wish we lived.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Is it just me, but I update both phone and tablet and note I no longer get the option to download anything higher than 630x360. That's not acceptable. Give back the higher resolutions.  This app used to be great.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|How could this movie go wrong with this lineup of actors?  My only complaint is the gender thing.  Only one role for an actress over 50, and lots of old geezers.  And why does Bruce Willis have to score with a granddaughter image?  Same old stuff--but at least they had ONE experienced woman role.  Other than that, the movie was great.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to play and very entertaining.  Is perfect to play it while waiting at the doctor appointments or at any other places that requires distractions.
B00BU18U82|5.0|Great game. I think if you like farm games you should definitely get it. The only downside is there are no animals and you can't walk around.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Good graphics fun to play with others love this game very addictive HATE that you have to buy credits or wait like an hour for moreGood concept
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is perfect for fans of the movie. It is so addicting. I recommend this movie for any person that is a minion or minion lover at heart.
B002CLBJPK|1.0|While normally, my items arrive in solid boxes, I ordered this DVD with two others. They arrived in flimsy cardboard that was nearly shredded open. I could see my DVDs through the giant hole in the side of the box. All three cases were damaged badly even to the point of being torn through the plastic. One of the discs became warped due to the damage it sustained on the trip (this one). Oh all three were still watchable, and my daughter fell in love with them. And I wasn't about to make my 4 year old have to wait until they come back before being able to watch them again. Not to mention the fact that there's no guarantee that the new ones I exchanged the for would arrive in any better condition.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I've read a review that says the sound on this can get out of sync a bit.  I haven't had a chance to watch this version yet.  I remember the story being delightful, and a very imaginative adventure.  I would say that anyone who's looking for a little whimsy would be happy with this movie.  I'll adjust this review as I find the need.  My 4 year old has gone to bed, so I'll have to wait until tomorrow when we watch it in order to give a better opinion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the way the picture look like  . I know that cuz I had to get the picture.awesome game
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Real people with real issues.. The story explores how families and individuals are impacted and deal with mental health issues.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Awesome show!! It's a British icon, and I love how this new series got started. Love the Doctor and Rose!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is soooo fun. You start out as a reef shark, but that's all I'm going to tell you guys! I recommend this app it is FUN!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a fun way to pass time. Its easy to catch on and just a great all around game to play on my kindle fire.
B00296A4F4|5.0|The epitome of everything wonderful about Glee!  A great introduction to all of the characters and a fun way to relive how far they've all come.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|The bickering starts immediately and never stops! However, there are some moments. It's hard to find one character to like.
B00CZAYNOC|4.0|I preordered the cd because they are my favorite band. I followed the tracking and i watched it arrive at the facility and say out for delievery. It never showed up and the next day i checked and it was in MN, and i live in WI. It then proceeded into the western portion of WI and showed up at my house a day late didnt understand.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|White noise is miserable, it is like a blurred tv. I try to turn it off, once u turn it off it turns it back on.
0761169253|5.0|programmer.  This is a great all around book for anyone in a creative industry.  I find myself using the concept of a 'swipe file' to describe the creative process for designing software systems.  I don't think anything was earth shattering, but it is a very quick read and it includes nuggets of truth that are easy to remember and deploy.  Overall, I thought this was just a wonderful purchase and I am really glad that I stumbled upon it.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I watched this film on a whim after a long night of wine - couldn't have made a better selection.
B007RQ6WCA|5.0|I can have my files on my tab and share it when ever i want. It sincronize really fast. Love it.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|There is alot of setup  (even if it isn't the common hand holding type of setup) so alot doesn't actually happen , but this is a long series, you can't judge it by just one book.
B00461BQC0|5.0|Great songs . .. the whole album.  Don't have to skip every other song to get to the ones I like.  They have produced another great one.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Product was in great condition & received it earlier than expected.<br />Love Avatar 3D! So realistic and true to life.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT!! It support flash pages so i can see programs on line at some pages that can't on the silk (the original browser of the kindle).
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|This is an unbelievable soundtrack! The movie was great, the soundtrack is even better! The songs from my younger years resurrected into a whole new generation by some awesome performers. Tom Cruise is incredible! My kids LOVE THIS CD (ages 8,11,12) and I have to keep stealing it back from everyone so I can listen, great that the kids can enjoy it with me!
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|close your eyes, open your ears, and listen! Simple as that, just listen.<br />They say I need seven more words for this review but the ones above should suffice
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This trilogy is awesome. It is very addicting, very hard to put this book down. I wish there were more of these books.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Oblivion is only a imaginative, more expressive enemy boss away from being a certified classic. The visuals, sound fx, acting and score are all first rate. Even the idea of Cruise as a lone patrolman/repairman is well conceived, as his character slowly evolves from an optimistic boy scout into a reluctant revolutionary. My one gripe with the film is that after spending much of the movie building toward a confrontation with the enemy and the truth, which happens to be one and the same, the director elects to represent the big baddie as a faceless, featureless, expressionless machine. Cold, calculating logic is lethal to be sure but it's also not very interesting and does not give us the memorable villain that this movie desperately deserved. From the previews I had hoped that Freeman was the bad guy since we never get to see him in such roles and I can't help but think that this plot twist is probably what begin to calm my wild expectations. The \\"scavs\\" are human? Really? Wow. That could only mean that the real aliens must really be repulsive, menacing, mesmerizing and unforgettable. Right? Wrong. 2001 was a great movie but the whole computer/robot/intelligent machine as the villain is a let down of the lowest order.
B00A04FG5K|1.0|Love the magazine and would like to rate higher but, in the absence of any Android support, have no option but to rate one star. I emailed National Geographic but received a dismissive response that they only support iClones and got the impression that Android users are second class citizens.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Not only is it a Irreplaceable historical documentary for any Rocker young or old, it very entertaining as well. Well done Dave.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having previously read Dr. Raymond Moody's book, &#34;Life After Life&#34;; This outstanding book provided further proof as well as scientific evidence of our next life to come.<br /><br />AND, All God's children said:AMEN!!<br /><br />C. Mack Jean<br />Brentwood, TN
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is great. Fast paced and true to the original card game. I would recommend this for all ages.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|Very cute, fun and entertaining. Pass can be it a bit fast and hard without money but completely possible and still fun. Lots of upgrades and most use coins you earn in game.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|for a game, it is simple, just keep upgrading your vehicle. a good time spent going further each time on the courses.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really liked playing this game but you lose energy so quickly and then if you want to keep playing right away you have to pay actual cash. I just go to another game and wait about 20 minutes to complete my task. Other than that I really like this game.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I am not, not have ever been a fan of Ironman, so this game is not something I would enjoy. For a fan of Ironman and/or video games, it's a good choice.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book will not disappoint readers. Lot of high action and a solid storyboard. I can't even think of anything bad about it.
1934429376|5.0|This book is full of inspiration for those who love the natural world, and for those with an eye for clean midcentury lines.  Charley Harper is a wonderful artist.  Your coffee table is not complete without this colorful compendium of playful imagery.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the third novel by Hosseini that I've read and was as captivated by this as I was the first two. His ability to develop the essence of his characters, and make the reader an intimate of theirs is one of his strong points. His descriptive narrative takes the reader to the settings and scenery, with the skill of a set designer. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to absorb the story of the books they read.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Season 2 is solid though not as fresh as season 1. There were multiple times you get annoyed with Mike's character for having a lack of appreciation for where he is and how he got there; this is almost always at those moral crossroads that seem to conflict with his beliefs. There are also lots of new characters starting from mid-season that keeps you on the edge of your seat, you won't regret!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good read all three of her books in this trilogy.  Just read and you imagination will take you to new horizons
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because its hard and fun at the same time and you get to beat bosses like vector
B0063IH60K|5.0|Sometimes maybe I just like to do something different than reading and Solitaire is a good fit.  It is nice to have it on the Kindle
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I enjoyed it. I don't care what professional reviewers say, I liked it.<br />Awesome special effects, and I did like the theme
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Since it is connected through Facebook, expect loading issues.  Any game associated with Facebook has loading issues. Otherwise, when it is loaded,  it's a fun game.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book is addictive once you see who place the characters in the upcoming movie however the book is a little disappointing.  But still worth the ride
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I enjoy the movie although story could have been more substantial. The visuals are stunning and design wise , same thing. I would love to  see a sequel of it .
0399226907|5.0|This is a great story and a cute little book.  So cute that my eldest daughter insisted we do her baby sister's 1st party with the theme.  It's a perfect theme for a 1 year old.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|So I bought this watch because I am a bartender and can not use my phone, which is my primary time keeping tool, behind the bar. I work late nights and early mornings, the watch changes days when it should but it scrolls through the other languages before it fully changes. So if you are looking at your watch at 2am the day will be in a separate language. Also if you do not wear it for a couple days it does not get charged as it runs on kinetic energy, and you have to reset the time and date.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It started off slowly but I'm so glad I stuck with it. What an amazing story of redemption and love, not to mention the glimpse into the lives of the 19th century Parisian poor.
B00AMZBAJS|5.0|Its so goofy, light-hearted and fun...with some seriousness throw in! Really havent laughed so hard watching a tv comedy in a long time! Well done show! Cant wait for season 3 to start at the end of September :)
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I m waiting for season 8 to finish and am planning on pre-ordering  the whole 8th season, I can't wait!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Why did I want so long to watch Downton Abbey?  Very much enjoyed every minute and now looking forward to see what is in store in Season 4 coming in January!
B009PNQUXO|1.0|When I pressed the videos I downloaded it said it couldn't play the video. So this app does not work
B0090P98Z4|4.0|As with most glu games, lots of igp options. Haven't had to buy anything yet. We shall see after a few more levels.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As to be expected, the third season of Downton Abbey is wonderful. You'll enjoy every episode. There are some new,unexpected twists of plot.<br />If you loved the previous two seasons, you'll love the third as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun and very pleased with not having the same run every time I play. Well written game. I highly recommend it.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Really good rep of an aging bruce wayne still trying to lay it down his way.<br />More for older kids adults. But very cool.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This thing is addictive. So many, choices so much fun. I love that you can compete with yourself to earn more points to purchase more games. I also love when the games go on sale. A girl loves a good sale.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is so awesome every thing you want you can get it I recommend you can get this app
B007HACDLK|4.0|Really going to miss his writing. Vince Flynn was a compelling author. a Gripping story line. Mitch Rapp does it again.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Really good for many different areas. great for travel as well as use of maps. Find this app very handy
B00AECGQF2|4.0|Of  a good game but still needs more graphics and more people and also it needs more thing to make the hair look goood
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Pop Cap have seemingly forgotten that they released anything on Amazon. Works fine on my Verizon Galaxy Nexus. Thanks, ya bums.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is very addictive I absolutely love it and I love how fast paste it gets this is a very fun game and anyone can play it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I'm really enjoying this game, it's just challenging enough for me. The only problem is me (18yrs old) and my sister (6yrs old) share my kindle to play games and it makes the difficulty based off your age that you can only put in once.
044024367X|3.0|I guess it isn't Reacher's fault that I don't like Scary Closed Town Conspiracy stories.  If there are towns like this in this day and age, I don't understand it. Google Maps and Twitter should take care of them. Anyway, I didn't like it when the Mission Impossible crew got stuck in such a town and I don't like it in Nothing to Lose. Three stars for being Reacher.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this! I have never played anything like this, but would like to see more. Beautiful graphics and animation!
B00C6BACF4|5.0|it's one of those movies that you would want to keep going back to watch and with the steel book edition its a nice fit to a collection
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Less ads to spend money for toddlers<br />Cute action and figures for small minds. Online no real use for friends. My kids like characters and boats. Cost too much for kids<br />Attacks r way to often on your ship and rubies r expensive
B008Y78GYI|5.0|Admittedly, a die hard fan of Streisand, no matter what she performs in.  And worlds better than the sequel that came a decade or so later.
B00C6B8EJK|5.0|it's one of those movies that you would want to keep going back to watch and with the steel book edition its a nice fit to a collection
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|No problems with uno it's fun to play and the graphical nice a guide would make it better though s starting off is the hardest part of the entire game
B009Y61ZMI|5.0|None of the fancy stuff, pretty straight forward; bad will not win and a price is always to be paid by somebody. Russel's eye contact is marvelous.
B0002IQMKM|4.0|Bought as a gift for my nephew.  He knows only the hits so thought this was a great way to introduce him to this fab group.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Useful, informative, well written. I`d recommend for anyone looking for a logical outlook to business ownership and operation. This individual had an agenda with heart.
B001974DG0|5.0|Read this a number of years ago & thought I would read it again. Loved as much as I did the first time.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|When it comes to unique, thought-provoking, intense music and lyrics, these guys are equals to the masters of the genre. If you've never given them a listen, this is a good intro cd.  I have a lot of their albums. I bought this for my brother who never heard them until one day in my car. He was hooked.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Why do people need to test drive a free app I am confused about that can anyone tell me why
1452000247|5.0|A non-stop magical journey through a multitude of worlds with never-ending bizarre characters. An entertaining, fast paced children/YA story which draws you into places you could never imagine! A wonderful mix of elements, reminiscent of a dark Alice in Wonderland, Lion Witch and the Wardrobe and Tim Burton. Can't wait for the next book from this author.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is soooo awesome It is way better then survivalcraft but minecraft should make a multyplayer app so people can play together for free
B003G4W49C|5.0|I LOVED IT!!! It shows in such great detail Ender`s struggles with everything, battle school, his brother. Truly amazing!!<br />AMAZiNg
B006LSZECO|4.0|Lots of twists and turns in plot...keeps you immersed in story...  complex characters.....interesting points of view and ongoing story line with alternating his and her chapters.<br />However, the ending was less than satisfying. The reference to Amy's 'brilliance' in mental illness, the husband's complete life defeat, the unpunished crimes and the future safety and health of their unborn child left this reader wanting closure and there was none.
B00CHMBQRA|3.0|it is an okay movie, amusing, not overly orginal, but entertaining. will not be one of my all time favorites
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|either you like a movie or you don't. my husband loved it. I thought it was slow and boring. Done!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|An enjoyable romp through history.  The story a lot like the James Bond stories.  I enjoyed the plot.  It didn't seem stereotyped.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really fun game. Reminds me of Mist, but more intricate details. Frustrating at times, but worth it. Sad when I beat it. Need more rooms!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing you can earn a lot of coins and prizes and you go to different places and it's free so buy it
B001AQR3E4|4.0|Although we have seen Brad Pitt in various roles, his performance tugs at your heart-strings as we parades around the world as a a lonely vampire seeking companionship. However, I found Tom Cruise's performance the most fascinating; he plays a character that is completely unlike any character I have seen him play (and he tends to play the same guy). I'm not sure that I could call it brilliant acting, but I couldn't pull myself away.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game brought back memories.  I really love the fact that I am playing with actual people.  I love it
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I cannot express how in awe I was at the set and score, and the creative liberties this movie took that differs from the staged show. And a wonderful performance by the beautiful Emmy Rossum. Seriously, that girl is TALENTED. (Let's also keep in mind that she was ONLY 16 when she starred in this movie. Wow.)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is fun and can teach you a lot of things about horse's and thanks to this game I might get a horse's thanks for making this game soooooooooooo much fun.
B00377V6J2|5.0|this album is live & live always beats studio  cuts hands down. I caught the PBS showing of this last week. Did not know much of Stevie Ray before but was familiar with Albert King. This CD?DVD combo has great songs on it
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|my child enjoyed it very much and played with it for hours but managed with little help. but he is 4yrs
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is great it reminds me of my childhood and the computer games that I grew up playing. its a game of fun and stratagie.:
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Baldacci always delivers with suspense and non-stop action.which holds the readers attention.<br />I look forward to more and more of his writing.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It should be somewhere exotic instead of a guard break into a zoo AN get chased by a lion other than that I really like the app
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending is kind of expected but great all the same . Very gruesome. I liked it a lot it was good.
B007L6VR12|4.0|I liked this movie.  It's a cute young love theme during 1965.  The Khaki Scout, Camp Ivanhoe squad is great and boy scout reminiscent.  My uncle (a Tiger Scout Club Leader) would consider the camp and the Fort as his nemesis.<br /><br />I liked the photography - beginning I thought the house resembled a doll house and picturesque family, same goes for the scout club.  I thought the plot was good and original.  The acting was very well done.  My favorite characters are Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) and Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton).  Suzy was bad a$$ and Randy was a cute dork.<br /><br />It had it's typical Wes Anderson humor.  I have seen just a a few of his previous works.  I've seen Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.  Moonrise Kingdom is my favorite now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I believe everyone should get this game because it shows you how yo take good care of your pet horse
0393317552|1.0|So I finally got around to reading this libtard's apologetic of western civilization and honestly it should have been put off indefinitely. I usually do not enjoy comedic historical revisionism and this was certainly not an exception.<br /><br />The author looks like a hideous white chimpanzee with down syndrome who was beaten over the head with paddles in a burlap sack by angry gorilla youths in the process of a hate crime! Not surprisingly a person with these qualities is a complete social recluse and outcast. This parasitical chud is an entrenched bureaucrat from the shallow and decayed halls of academia who spends his time doing useless and counterproductive field work off the edge of the world making up fantasies about the evolutionary history of birds all the while draining precious resources from taxpayers who would have probably had the capital to build the Star Ship Enterprise by now if it wasn't for monstrous destructive nation states that have stolen the genius of our minds and the sweat of our labor. Just to give it to a bird watcher amongst other parasitical degenerates.<br /><br />Oh my science! Man the fallacious argument defense shields we are under ad hominem attack! Whoa Nelly, there is a very good reason I came out attacking this hideous wretch's physical stature and his immoral anti-human lifestyle and behavior. You see he is just as vile, despicable, and want of our contempt in his heart as well as his looks and behavior. How so?<br /><br />He begins his fictional narrative by trying to discredit and debase the amazing, spectacular and life enhancing accomplishments of western civilization in general and the Caucasian race in particular! Even going so far to claim that the white race is genetically inferior to other races! Yes this waste of sp**m actually said that, saying that illiterate cannibalistic papa new guineas with an IQ of 10 who couldn't even write their own names in the mud with a stick our far more innately intelligent than westerners! Only an ugly hate filled loser of life would make such a denigrating statement of bald faced nonsense and lies. So now that you know that you are facing: jealousy, self-hatred, bias, prejudice, and Invincible Ignorance. I will cut to the long and short of it.<br /><br />Western nations dominated the world before committing suicide in WWI and WWII* because they had cows, chickens, wheat grass, and a secret weapon of goats!!!!!!! What the F? Yeah that's the secret of history, progress, and civilization. First you get the wheat grass, and then you get the cows, then immunity to the common cold, then the cities, then government, writing, technology, and finally boom-boom sticks.<br /><br />Francisco Pizarro conquered the Inca nation with a handful of adventures because they had access to goats back in Spain! That was the only difference. This may scare you, but in the U.S. there are genetically modified spider goats! HOLY SCIENCE! We will conquer the moon with this technology!<br /><br />Only a complete fool would ignore the factors of intelligence, culture, and HUMAN ACTION in the very study of human history.<br /><br />If you really want to know why the west won read Culture and Carnage by Victor Davis Hanson that shows the culture elements of individual freedom (\\"free to live as you please\\" -Pericles), decisive battle (no Persian or Indian walked out of the Macedon war machine alive), citizen soldiers (the heart and soul of any true republic), property rights (try to come and take it from landed infantry protecting the lands that they OWN!), technology and science (what are the wages of reason? Ask Montezuma.), free markets (capitalism kills, the Turkish empire of hundreds of millions couldn't even fight a commercial free city state of Venice of 250,000!), individualism (army of one, Francisco Pizarro and a handful of individual self actualized men crushed an empire of slaves!), and dissent and self-critique (critical for learning, adaptation, and progress).<br /><br />Gee I wonder if these powerful social and cultural forces are more important to human history than whether somebody had wheat grass or maize? Hmmmmmmmmmmm I don't know it's hard to breathe and think at the same time.<br /><br />If you ask, \\"well what caused the culture or what are the factors that produced it\\"? Well that is the real hard problem of human history! I think we would need an honest discussion about intelligence so \\"Understanding human history\\" by Michael H. Hart would be a good place to start. Of course human action is also part of the tale so \\"Human Action\\" by Ludwig Von Mises and \\"Democracy the God that Failed\\" by Hans Herman Hoppe (one of the greatest philosophers in the 20th century) will give invaluable insights into praxeology and time-preference (extremely important factor).<br /><br />If you read this review and thought, culture! Time-preference! Human Action! INTELLIGENCE!!!!!!! Science damn this racist! Congratulations you are an open minded libtard who actually read a dissenting review. Now go back to your mindless cult of how smart you are, even though you couldn't hold a job at Starbucks in the private sector. Anthony Weiner's campaign isn't go to run itself, and the welfare queens, corporate fascists, and trial lawyers need that black mailed, comprised pedophile** more now than ever to lobby and pass laws for them.<br /><br />*(throwing in my own idea here about the suicide of western civilization, don't expect this sleazy pimp ideas to ever come up with some thing like that)<br /><br />**If you tweet naked images to underage girls you are a pedophile. Most politicians are not elected, they are selected because they can be extorted and leveraged by special interest groups by the skeletons in their closet, this freak probably has children's skeletons in his closet.

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Romance between a (apparently) temporary zombie and real human. It is entertaining and a new twist on zombie flicks which appear to be proliferating these days. I would have liked more details about how it is that these zombies are able to become human again after the fact is established that they need to eat human brains to survive. But as it is a fantasy - that is left to the imagination. Basic tale is that love conquers all...even being a zombie. Nicholas Hoult is a real charmer in this movie. I hardly recognized Rob Corddry as M.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think subway surfer is unique in its own ways, like having a relaxed environment and colorful textures. I think in my opinion it is the product of two guys mixing ideas from temple run and jetpack joyride.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|If you are 9-13 years old (or think like one) than this movie is a go. Lots of gross out humor with the giants. The story involving the humans is mildly interesting and very predictable. Ian McShane is totally wasted here as the out-of-touch king. And of course the princess is going to fall in love with the wrong sort of guy.  Seemed to me that the story line wasn't too well thought out and the last 1/4 of the movie was an add-on after they realized the film was too short.
B0036G1T78|3.0|Sometimes movies start with something that really peak your interest, and then the characters, who we are supposed to relate to, end up doing some things that any normal person would never do.  Clearly you would be in an extreme state of mind if all your friends were killed inexplicably and you are running for your life, but would anyone really think &#34;yeah, I think I should have sex with this woman I am holding hostage because that will at least take the edge off of this ridiculous trouble I'm in&#34;?  Even more so, would any woman, even if she is in an unfulfilling and unhappy relationship, think &#34;yes, I think I will have sex with this poor guy on the run, even though he is a total stranger, even though he has basically kidnapped me for his own safety, even though he has dragged me into his ridiculous trouble, because I'm sure this will make everything better for the both of us&#34;?  I don't really have a problem with the sex scene itself as it wasn't graphic, but anything, and that includes sex scenes, which distracts from the story or makes the story less believable, in my opinion does not belong in a movie.  I was left scratching head after seeing it as I just found it difficult to believe anyone would be inclined to act this way under the circumstances.
B006QKJQM6|5.0|I really liked KFP 1 so it is not too surprising I liked the sequence. Unlike most animated films this has a pretty interesting story (and yes lots of action). Kids will love it and most adults will probably find it entertaining. Nice movie for the holidays when the kids are getting bored and the adults just want to relax.
B0061S0A64|4.0|As a musician & a music lover, I love the concept.  The musical options(notes, key, etc.) give you ways to really customize the music.  The operation controls are a little difficult to get used to.  Overall, a good music creation tool.  Maybe adding different instruments, like a synth, would add to the fun!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|When you start you are hooked. Better than watching old films on tv on a Saturday afternoon, don't know where the day has gone!!!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Kind of along the lines of inglorious basterds, this movie was not at all realistic, but totally fun to watch. Great acting, a little brutal.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I've read all of this author's books and FIND HIM A GREAT STORY TELLER.  This story covers many years, generations and locations but keeps the story well connected with its individual characters' stories.  Like all good stories they are neatly tied together at the end but not foolishly or contrived.  You end with the feeling that the people will go on with their lives a bit wiser and somewhat more connected.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|Great movie, obviously very violent but a tribute to old kung fu movies etc. great acting, great directing by quentin as always.

B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I read many reviews about this film saying it is garbage.<br />This movie is far from garbage. It's problem : oriental story for american market. Guillermo Del Toro was forced to make this film for the American market. That was the only mistake, this movie should have been directed by Del Toro but with a Japanese production.<br />He could have done in the style of the film \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", a film totally oriental, then it would have been done better.<br />Considering that, this is a great movie. But only if you know the tradition of japanese stories in this style.<br />The action scenes are excellent. The story manages to hold the attention. Should have done more in the style of a comic book. The emotional scenes not convinced. There is a romantic couple inserted by obligation (ladies, girlfriends, wives?). Requirements for U.S. market and for a greater audience.<br />The film was produced in the best way possible and is the best (only one?) for fans of the genre.<br /><br />Update:<br />Please support Del Toro and buy the blu-ray .<br />It's the only way we can help people that do movies like this to continue.<br />I want a second movie.

B009NNG202|5.0|So many movies these days are repeats on the same old themes. We were starving for something new. This movie did not disappoint. We found it engaging, and highly entertaining with great cinematography and storyline. The cameo by Dustin Hoffman added a lightness to what could have been a dark film. There are twists around every corner. One of the few films we would watch again. Rent it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought this the first day it came out. I was not disappointed. It streams netflix beautifully, even better than my phone. I can control it from anywhere in the house. Youtube and Google Play Movies work great too, with a slight delay. TabCasting works also, even though its in beta, it works pretty good. HD playback works great, looks better than FIOS does. Mine came with 3 months of Netflix free, which was a steal. For only $35 I would highly recommend it, and Google will do updates each month, so more features may be added later.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Excellent, exhaustively researched and footnoted book from a historians viewpoint, not a critique of religious claims.<br />Jesus of Nazareth was a man, an extraordinary man, and this book places him in his time and place.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Some levels were not to tough, but others stumped me. I have a college education, but needed my fifth grader to help out with a .few puzzles. I thought it was fun. I can't wait for more levels.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|The movie itself is good, but there is a serious problem with the ending of the film, as people on youtube have already noticed. For example, Professor X and Magneto, according to movie one, built Ceribro together, which would mean that they didn't part ways so early in their relationship. Second example, Charles Xavier walked in X Men Origins: Wolverine, and X Men 3, which means he could not have lost the use of his legs until much later in his life. The movie itself left a little to be desired in the acting and many characters were easy to forget because the viewer was not introduced to them on an individual scale, like in the earlier films.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game...it is hard to get the last objective, but I have played many games.  I even paid for one of the characters, and was happy to give the creators a little money.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over---I love the music reference and sounds..perfect for the music/romantic love story person
0380729407|2.0|I read Fahrenheit 451 years ago and, while I thought it was a decent book, I could not understand why it was considered by so many as one of the greatest novels of the century.<br /><br />This is the second Bradbury book I have read, and I didn't like it at all. The story is somewhat interesting, but it is completely muddled by Bradbury's poor and pretentious prose.<br /><br />I can fully appreciate good prose of someone like Cormac McCarthy, but Bradbury is punching way above his weight class. He is someone with, perhaps, as much talent as Stephen King (which is to say, he does have some talent) but he is trying to write like Herman Melville. Wading through his writing is like trying to walk through chest high brambles. I just wanted to know what happened next, and found myself finally skipping sentences and paragraphs at a time. And what I got in the end was certainly not rewarding enough to warrant the effort.

B00004W221|5.0|You don't need another reviewer to state that if you dream large enough, hard enough, and long enough, your dream will materialize into physical reality. But something else should be mentioned. Rudy's dream was to play football, if only for a few seconds, for Notre Dame. But that his dreaming, and follow-through, would inspire a film loved by vastly more people than filled the stadium the day he played for Notre Dame: that's the grand prize of dreaming.

0615782043|5.0|What a cohesive tale these expressions reveal, not only about the author, but about the experience behind the words.  There was one, in particular that struck me, because the prose was brilliant.  The author is a wonderful poet, and Ill admit, what a fun idea for a book!  Loved it.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I have watched this movie, LOL. It brings back this warm comfort feeling taking me back to my childhood. If I could own any prop from a film it would be the \\"The Goonies\\". If you have never seen this film it is a must because you will always hold a special place for this film in your heart.
B00CEF014E|4.0|If you like to have your mind taken on a twisted frolic through a disturbed mind, then you need this book.  I wasn't able to put it down as I was taken on the journey with the main character's descent into madness.<br /><br />Unlike many other stories of this genre, I wasn't able to predict where it was going to end up.  I was surprised more than once and morosely enchanted the whole way through.
B006RXQ62U|5.0|Not my first time to see this but the first for my teenage son - he loved it. Given who the actors are and that they are not the typical musical fare makes this that much more a five star. I love watching the transformation of the actors and the characters they play. The music is great. This is a keeper - one you can watch over and over and still be entertained each time.
B00E7PQVHK|1.0|Sad to say it keeps crashing. I tried reinstalling the game __alas. no avail.  Hope they can fix it. I am a might and magic fan from way back
B0095P31L6|4.0|I know the critics beat this up and no it's not a GREAT movie but it is a good artistic movie and still very entertaining for the reasonably thinking person. It is not a slap happy hilarious film nor is it intended to be - once you catch on to the dry humor you will really enjoy this and then want to see it again to pick up on what you missed. it is a worthy watch.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|i enjoy music from the past and listen to Pink Floyd all the time. He never gets old. I have several tunes from his albums.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Certainly a much different depiction of who Jesus might have been, much more insurrectionist and revolutionary than usually portrayed in mainline Christology.  The backdrop of the ruthless, cruelness of the Roman rule and the hypocrisy of the Jewish heirarchy contribute to the heroic nature of his struggle to focus his world on the plight of the poor and the marginalized.

020530902X|5.0|My book[[ASIN:B00CR5AGM8 Spagtionary Vol. 1: A salacious, gory, and funny Dictionary of Errors a la Aesop]] made it to the kindle best sellers list as a grammar reference, and since most of my style came from this book, I had to come here and say thank you very much for writing such a beautiful style guide. The book I wrote was just a humble way to show how the principles I learned here could be put in practice, that's why I used short stories to teach grammar. Thank you very much William Strunk Jr., I wish there were more stars to give you.
B009WUBERW|4.0|This is a movie for just having some fun - no Shakespeare plot here. In fact, this is a bit predictable plot, but still enjoyable.
1592402038|5.0|This book inspired me to write a humorous book on grammar. This one [[ASIN:B00CR5AGM8 Spagtionary Vol. 1: A salacious, gory, and funny Dictionary of Errors a la Aesop]], which made it to the best sellers list.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cord works great I also purchased the turbo adapter with it. The cord is longer than the one that came with my kindle which is perfect.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|So yes. This was a good trilogy for two weeks. I read it after long hesitation. It was something different for me i guess given the fact that i am probably the only person who doesnt know how Bella and Eduard the vampire ended up after the first movie. So i have to admit this book took me by surprise and i do not understand why is it compared to the other story. Anyways. I do have to concur that i have never read a book where the words and even whole sentences were repeating so fracking much. The sex scenes in the second half of the first book were repetitive and uninteresting after a while i though of Ana as of a whinning little girl which i would just have to slap if i was her inner goddess or conciousness or whatever. However i continued reading through the second and then third book which i was not able to put down. I loved the story probably for the same reason as every other girl or woman if you will. I have to admit that i enjoyed the second and maybe the third book more than the first one. Which i consider to be light porn only no quality story behind it at all. Of course i loved the epilogue and meet christian at the end.

B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I rate this game a 5 to 10 star's. It's almost like team fortress 2. I will recommend this to other's.
030759565X|5.0|My new favorite cookbook! The book is a keeper just for the stunning photographs, but I am eagerly anticipating trying the vast majority of the recipes.  I highly recommend the \\"Peach and Sour Cream Pancakes\\", and the \\"Tomato Scallion Shortcakes with Whipped Goat Cheese\\" (this is the dish on the cover). Yum!  I am really pleased that most of the recipes are reasonable for cooks who have a life outside of the kitchen, yet produce beautiful, tasty, eye-catching food.  This has become my go-to cookbook for gift-giving.
B00DL47ORO|5.0|I watched the film, and it's even more powerful than I had imagined.  I teared up several times, including the moments when the whale mothers cry out in anguish as their calves are torn from them for profit.  If David Kirby's [[ASIN:1250031257 Death at SeaWorld: Shamu and the Dark Side of Killer Whales in Captivity]] articulated in words why these intelligent creatures should not be caged and \\"trained\\" for our amusement, Ms. Cowperthwaite conveyed the same, powerful message with visuals.  The images will haunt you for a long time, especially when contrasted against the healthy, vibrant orca families in the wild.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is good if you are into puzzles that are a challenge. its a good way to pass time and entertain yourself.
B002ZG9940|2.0|I don't put spoilers into my reviews, and so I'm very limited with what I can say here.  The photography is extremely accomplished; the locales are beautiful, and the two protagonists are guaranteed sex appeal draws.<br /><br />Too bad about the story.<br /><br />There's a mammoth plot twisting head scratcher not even 5 minutes in which never gets answered in the movie. There's a couple in the middle, and three at the end. These are not small things which don't make sense.  They're \\"the movie turns on this point\\" kinds of dilemmas for the viewers.<br /><br />Considering the long silences and very small amount of dialogue, that's quite a collection of plot twists which don't make sense to cram into a movie.<br /><br />I think the only way to watch this movie and enjoy it is with the sound off. I'm seldom so blunt in a review, but this movie deserves it.
B00498YZFK|5.0|I don't often get to watch a movie in which I am totally drawn into the characters and story line. A true work of art,and one I can watch again
0375869026|5.0|A wonderful and touching story about the importance of kindness and love.  The story is told from a number of perspectives and voices about a young boy who was born with severe birth defects.  It's a heartwarming story about not just his struggles, but the experiences of his friends and family as they try to make sense of life.  The author does a wonderful job of capturing and describing the feelings of multiple characters through her narrative.  I picked it up at 8:30pm and couldn't put it down until I finished early the next morning.

B00C2PO09I|3.0|If you're buying this for the story then I suggest you look elsewhere. I like the idea, but the dialogue fails. The worst part is the narration. The main actor has one of the worst voices that I have ever heard used as a narrator, and I've been watching a ton of Disney movies with our little ones. If you're looking for a quirky love story then I'd suggest something from Baz Luhrmann instead. In fact, I wish Luhrmann had directed this one. He could have done a special story like this and made it pop.<br /><br />If you're buying this for the cinematics then I'd say pick it up and show off that nice TV of yours!! It looked great in 1080P on a Pioneer 60&#34; plasma and a 55&#34; Vizio E-series. I just purchased a LG 3d tv and haven't checked it out in that yet. I'm expecting it to look pretty slick.

B008BQ8VOC|3.0|I like the idea of the show, but I don't like the foul language, drugs, or sex.  None of it enhances the quality of the show.  I won't be watching season 3.
B001KL0WJW|4.0|Honestly, the movie isn't bad and is entertaining. As I said, I saw it when it first came out and felt exactly the same way then as I do now. Its worth a Sunday watch when you have nothing else to do.
B006LXQID8|1.0|Glorifies a Creepy Stalker, and it's somehow OK since she's attractive? Inverted double standard, and implies not only that being cute is enough to get away with murder, but that it should be so.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|After all the controversial I was a little reluctant to waste any time with this. But the movie was mildly entertaining. A decent story and some good acting. The violence was a bit over the top. A little too wet and a bit hooky, almost to the point of making you chuckle. What won't make you chuckle is the over use of the N word. About half way through I was getting a little numb to it, Like, I get it they're slaves. Out side of the non realistic violence and possibly too realistic use of the N word, it was an OK movie. The kind that you are glad you paid six bucks to watch at home, than drop forty at the theater.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War is complex and well written. It is an exciting read.
1439152810|4.0|I really enjoyed this historical fiction mystery that spans decades and transports the reader back and forth in time from WW II London up to modern day.<br /><br />Told in alternating voices by the main characters, the story is about 3 people whose lives are set on a collision course brought about by chance meetings, unstable personalities, and the traumatizing events of the time period.<br /><br />Dorothy (Dolly) Smitham Nicolson has known tragedy - she came up to London to work at a boardinghouse and her family was killed in the bombings after the war started. She is now an elderly widow with 4 grown children and lies dying in a hospital. Laurel, her eldest daughter and an actress, is haunted by a scene she witnessed while at home one summer day long ago. Is it too late to ask her mother what that was about -- they have never spoken of it.<br /><br />Jimmy Metcalfe, a poor but accomplished photographer, and Dorothy meet, fall in love in 1938 and make plans to escape away from the horrors of the London Blitz to a seaside paradise. But they both have to work hard to save up enough money to realize their dream.<br /><br />Vivien, age 8, is sent to England from Australia when a car accident kills her family. She meets and marries a famous author, Henry Jenkins, and lives across the street from Dolly in a well-appointed mansion. She has the life that Dolly yearns for.<br /><br />The tantalizing story of these three plays out in wonderfully depicted period settings and with the backdrop of war and desperation. I was drawn in immediately and eager to solve the mysteries and hear those long buried secrets. Lots of twists and turns along the way as the author teasingly doles out clues and contradictions that create more questions that require investigation.<br /><br />The book is a bit convoluted and complicated and the reader needs to pay attention - perhaps even flipping back to reread certain sections at times. It comes together in a satisfying conclusion. I really liked this book and the writing style. I plan to read other novels by this author!<br /><br />Thank you to Goodreads for the copy to review.d this book and the writing style.

B005LAII80|5.0|Cops vs. bad guys in a giant skyscraper is what this film is about, and it delivers on all counts.  Karl Urban as Dredd is stiff-jawed, sarcastic and menacing, and his willowy rookie partner with psychic abilities is the perfect counterpoint to him.  Nena Headley (of Sarah Connor Chronicles) does a nice turn as Ma-Ma, the bone-chillingly viscous gang leader who locks the building down to capture Dredd and his partner after they investigate an honor killing related to a narcotics deal.<br /><br />It's the subtle things that really make this film work.  The deadpan dialog, the lack of exposition, the simple set-up.  The place: the street scenes shot in Johannesburg with digital overlays have a realistic depth to them, as do the multiple floors of the megablock Peachtrees, where all the action takes place.  If there was a fake looking effects match-up in the enormous digitally-composited concourse the characters enter through, I couldn't see it.  The building was like a real breathing place, with working poor, minorities, gangs, and unemployed.<br /><br />I mentioned 'western' for a good reason, much of this film plays out like a man-with-no-name spaghetti western with Clint Eastwood.  The subtexts and character motivations are all very primary, and on the nose, but because of the way it's done, it all works really well.  You don't LIKE Dredd, but you're glad he's doing his job.  You don't LIKE Ma-Ma, but you feel a certain pity for her, as she's as much a villain as a victim of her social status.  The supporting characters all add shades of grey into the moral conflict.<br /><br />Not much else to say, really. It's very well done, dryly amusing, dark, and contains some of the most strangely beautiful scenes of violence committed to film in recent memory.  If you like a strong-toned action film, this is one to see. If you like Karl Urabn, you HAVE to check this film out.<br /><br />As a science fiction cop film?  Probably the best of the past decade.

B00CGPPMKU|4.0|I loaded this app on my Kindle so my granddaughter could use it. She is 1 1/2 years old and loves to draw so this is a great app to keep her busy on car trips or when we are eating out. She loves seeing all the colors move over the screen and tapping her finger to change the flow. The colors are vibrant, and it can be mesmorizing watching the spirals and shapes change. The app makes it pretty easy to change background colors and colors of the movements. I am glad I downloaded this app and would reccommend it, especially for kids!
1400052181|5.0|&#34;Everybody in the world got her cells, only thing we got of our mother is just them medical records and her Bible.&#34;<br /><br />In 1951 doctors at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore diagnosed an unusually extreme case of cervical cancer. The breakneck growth rate and resistance to common remedies were unlike anything previously seen. Without informed consent, the doctor scraped a clump of cells from the cancerous tumor during one of the 30 year-old woman's visits and deposited them with a nearby cell culture lab operated by George Gey. There, in the air-controlled space of Gey's facility, something happened that researchers had long suspected out of reach. Where countless other cells before them had died, hers survived, and multiplied indefinitely. The immortality of this one cell line would prove instrumental in treating a number of the world's most heavy-hitting diseases and set the stage for an all new era in cell research, medical diagnosis, drug development and bioethics. But this is a story not just about bundles of cells, but about the humanity behind them, and in particular the family to which they will forever be tied.<br /><br />That woman was Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta passed away just nine months after diagnosis, but it would be more than two decades before her family received word of the namesake cell line which survived her--HeLa. Its value as a scientific and commercial commodity was paramount, getting bogged down in the thicket of rights and privacy less so. Once researchers discovered that Henrietta's cells did not die but instead bred a new generation every twenty-four hours, HeLa quickly became the tireless workhorse of the culture community. Vials were trucked to research facilities around the world, where they were regularly exposed to a pavilion of infectious diseases, merged with non-human DNA, and even shot into space in an effort to study the influence of zero gravity.<br /><br />Over time, details about the parent of the eponymous cells funneled out of view. Henrietta's own kin were oblivious to the fact that her cells lived, were being studied and tested in dozens of countries, and were being exchanged at great profit. Once the unwitting donor's official name was released, journalists descended in full fervor, leading to a lifetime of turmoil and unrest for the Lacks household. Set against the rich legacy of the family's cells, their life of poverty and unpaid medical bills seemed untoward by comparison, and this sense of injustice only mounted as more details filtered in from the press.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot's segue into this lush narrative was by and large a product of serendipitous circumstance, having first heard of HeLa in an intro to biology course at her local community college. After learning that these cells had lived outside their host's body for the better part of a century, and about the remarkable advances they have gifted to science, Skloot shot up her hand and innocently asked, &#34;Who was she?&#34; The professor's reply proved unsatisfying: &#34;An African American woman.&#34; The seed of curiosity had been planted. By the time Skloot graduated she'd decided to write a book to recover the disremembered woman whose cells had won so many victories for science and society.<br /><br />WHO WAS HENRIETTA LACKS?<br /><br />For more than a decade, Skloot layered herself into the Lacks' story, befriending and forming deep bonds with Henrietta's children and cousinry. She forges an especially strong connection with Deborah Lacks, Henrietta's youngest daughter, who was unfortunately too young to remember much about her mother. With a mix of patience and persistence the two work together to dig up Henrietta's heritage and bring to light her hitherto uncelebrated legacy. It is Skloot's at times unstable relationship and camaraderie with Deborah that gives the narrative its steam, as the two probe ever deeper into the mystery surrounding her mother.<br /><br />Tracing the family's roots placesHenrietta's childhood at the tail end of the Jim Crow era, a time when segregation meant a great deal more than which bathroom and water fountain one was required to use. Rampant legal disadvantages in the South bred systemic, institutionalized maladjustment for blacks, and this included limited access to medical care. Having spent her youth on a slave plantation in Clover, Virginia, Henrietta joined in the Great Migration at the age of twenty-one, exchanging her familiarity with tobacco fields for a new life in Baltimore. Nine years later, she would be diagnosed with the malignancy that led to her iconic cell line. And it would be another fifty years before Deborah, with the help of Skloot, laid eyes on her mother's original medical records.<br /><br />Johns Hopkins Hospital was founded for the express purpose of treating Baltimore's poor and, unlike today, informed consent upon providing blood or tissue samples was neither required by law nor common practice (the term did not even appear in a court document until 1957). Like everyone at the time, Henrietta hadn't a clue about what would become of her excised genetic material and the boons it would lavish upon the scientific community. This became a flashpoint issue in the years that followed as the occasional patient attempted to turn a gray area into a lucrative venture. While we learned more about DNA and transmissible disease, Henrietta's resilient cells inaugurated an international conversation on the commercialization of biological materials and where exactly the donors fit within that ecosystem. (Skloot includes a superb summary in the afterword which draws together the various threads of this nuanced debate.) In many ways, the conversation is ongoing.<br /><br />THE HELA LEGACY<br /><br />To properly gauge the vastitude of the legacy tied up in Henrietta's cells, it's important to understand 20th century cell culture. Until Henrietta came along, cell immortality was a pipe dream. While standard, non-cancerous cells had been grown in vitro since 1907, none of them survived long enough to endure important testing, petering out after 50 divisions, on average. Even cancer cells, like those common to cervical cancers, died shortly after relocation to the culture environment. This meant not only was there a brief window for experimentation but that a continuous supply of fresh cells was needed to sustain research. Many in the field yearned for a better way.<br /><br />HeLa keynoted a paradigm shift. They were robust enough to survive in the bricolage of materials used in Dr. Gey's culture medium, and they were still susceptible to the same range of infectious diseases as were normal cells. This allowed researchers to inject the lively DNA with diseases as well as cures. Not merely a boon to science, this revolutionized the field, so much so that one of the researchers Skloot interviews in the book, when asked what would happen if HeLa was pulled from research use, replied, &#34;Restricting HeLa cell use would be disastrous. The impact that would have on science is inconceivable.&#34; (p. 328)<br /><br />Thanks to Dr. Gey's partnering efforts with labs around the globe, the benefits of HeLa manifested seemingly overnight. In just one year after HeLa's genesis, Jonas Salk and his team were able to derive a vaccine for polio by infecting HeLa cells, followed shortly by drug treatments for HPV, herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia and Parkinson's disease. In 1953 HeLa became the first cells to be cloned successfully. In total, some 60,000 papers have been published on HeLa, and cell culturists still use her cancer cells as a model for human biology.<br /><br />What was it exactly that gave HeLa cells their added dose of moxie? Even today, we can only speculate. We now know that Henrietta was infected with both HPV and syphilis, so one theory is that this virulent combination may have helped suppress PCD. A rival theory suggests she had highly atypical genes to begin with, perhaps a rare mutation, that enabled the cancer to spiral in unspecified directions. We still are uncertain. HeLa has also been the source of much frustration over the years from regularly contaminating other cell lines, often halting research until the botch-up is sorted.<br /><br />CLOSING THOUGHTS<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot's ten-year effort is a literary and cultural marvel balanced between unsheathing the posthumous success and humanity behind one of the richest narratives in science and laying bare the bioethical implications to which it is attached. It succeeds on both fronts. Skloot is at her most animating when channeling the lens of Deborah Lacks as they band together to reach some much-needed closure to the saga thrust upon the Lacks family. With her first book, Skloot has demonstrated in equal measure her facility for conveying scientific nuance while weaving meaning and poetic force into a cohesive whole. Yes, this is first and foremost a work of nonfiction, but its pages are emblazoned with enough touches of novel-like charisma to beckon both crowds. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a timeless story delivered by a gifted writer and the definitive presentation of the legacy Henrietta never lived to see.

B004HWYTP4|5.0|We watched the movie just before we went to see Red 2. A lot of fun. I recommend this movie
B002AKPECW|4.0|The House of Suns was an enjoyable read with a murder mystery at its core, one that is more than a whodunit, and the development of relationships between the main characters that really matter to the reader.  We have energetic chase scenes, galaxy wide conflict, the passing of era and the tenuous beginning of another.  The scope is exceptionally broad both in space and time yet remains personal with three eclectic protagonists, one being a human machine hybrid...a sort of super &#34;Data&#34; who really has feelings and remarkable vision.  The human protagonists are called &#34;Shatterlings&#34; meaning clones.  The original of the shatterling &#34;line&#34; is a young woman indelibly marked by an insidiously addictive simulation game.  The nature of the game seemed a bit of a toadying to the fantasy reader with castles, sorcerers and armies of knight riding forth to battle which was my only issue with House of Suns.  Big ideas well told.

B008JFUO4U|4.0|This sci-fi flick was terrific. The space ship was a joy ride. Tom delivers yet another action-drama role in this post-apocalyptic tale.Unique story with grand scale and stellar visuals.  So glad I waited for blu-ray and avoided listening to reviews when this movie was in theaters.(Remember John Carter how they got that wrong!) Seeing it for myself and being my own critic, I absolutely give this movie 4 out of 5.<br /><br />If you are a sci-fi fan I would say it would be essential for your library. Watching it the second time was more enjoyable, because I was more stimulated by the visuals the first time go through, the second time I was more in tune with the story line. Great balance between the two. Last but not least the soundtrack was amazing. One of the best I've heard in a sci-fi movie.
B0011UGLK6|5.0|I like the generational threads that weave through the stories.  Their plights are univeral and not always unique to an Indian culture.
0452289963|5.0|I found the book helpful because of it's general sense of truth.  The author believes that each path is personal.  I've enjoyed pondering many of it's concepts presented. I can say it has changed major aspects of my life.
B0074YVW1G|1.0|I started reading it, found the style quite unscientific, and then looked up the author's credentials - she has a degree in English and is a lawyer. No apparent sign of psychology training. Sent it straight back to amazon.  Strangely it was recommended by a friend, with a PhD in psychology, to me, with a Masters in Psychology.  The level is below Psychology 101.

B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|This is probably my second favorite Reacher novel.  In this one the cold war is over, the army has down-sized, and Reacher and several members of his former special investigative unit have made the move to civilian life in America some years ago.  This story has the usual complexity of plot and physical movement that characterize the best Reacher novels.  But what makes this one unusually good is the introduction of the special investigators from the old military unit(especially Frances Neagley) as they avenge their own.  Frances appears in other Reacher novels and is as focused and ruthless as Reacher when the situation calls for it.  We are given more insight into Reacher, the numbers savant, whose mind involuntarily provides the mathematics of any situation.  And there are some really cool action sequences that are so satisfying you have to go back and read them again so as not to miss any of the details!
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I have always loved Lady Antebellum and I love this cd.  I would recommend it to any fans of country music.

B005LAIIKI|3.0|Tarantino does love film. And he knows how to direct. He has a couple instant classics in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. I much enjoyed Inglorious Bastards but I think I am getting the hint here. He is just looking to have fun in an old Hollywood style way. His style is starting to become a caricature of what it was before in some minor ways though. I like elements of the adventurous spirit and despise some of the bloated nature of the style. For every great scene in Django there are others that make you wish there was more to the story. More realism and more drama instead of wholesale 'entertainment'. It is what it is.<br /><br />The script is wild and playful and the period details are mostly decent though everything is still too damn clean for my liking. There is some symbolism and expert direction going on for sure. Samuel Jackson kind of steals the show in many scenes and the film is worth watching just for his performance alone. But towards the end I grew sick of the movie time violence and casual interplay between events and actors. I don't mean to sound like there is no message here but the film is clearly in the vein of the over-the-top style his films are becoming more and more accustomed to using. I lean towards a 3.5 here for a 7/10. Rent it or own it but it's a decent flick.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|it keeps buffering the videos so it would start and stop constantly.  don't like it, got something different and it works.
B00CTNUMPO|4.0|I have NEVER seen this film look this good before. Sure, they wiped away some grain and the image can seem pretty bright/dark at times but this sure allows you into the animation cells like no other version has. I would guess they could improve some of the contrast and coloring but I never expected them to take much care here. Some of the detail here is astounding compared to past releases. I really loved this film as a child and it is very nice to revisit it now on bluray to admire the animation and direction.<br /><br />It isn't as good as the top releases and doesn't seem as timeless but I know the characters and script are warm and inviting and kids should really enjoy the show imo. Better than a 95% of the stuff out there. I can't give it a full 5 stars but for what is there this is an easy buy for adult fans of animation and kids as well. Looking back to the years of my childhood has never been so fun and bluray is the right way to do it.

B00742BVW8|5.0|This is a great film following the model established by the amazing Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Another mystifying Kung Fu epic, Hero feels even a little more like a Chinese fable or story book. The structure of the film and social conventions depicted throughout give a great sense of immersion in Chinese culture. It is wonderfully shot, as might be expected, with fantastic poetic feats of swordsmanship and calligraphy by the major characters. Donny Yen appears at the beginning of the film and I can't wait to see him in the sequel to Crouching Tiger...
B005NFWCSK|3.0|First Class was an enjoyable movie that could have been much better than what it was. I would have liked to see more of Magneto's and Xavier's friendship with each other be more meaningful and impactful. I would have also liked Mystique's internal struggle with what it means to be human and a mutant fleshed out more--aside from just her comments on how she tries to hide from it. All in all, it was a movie that had huge potential given its license, yet it feels largely like the producers and screenwriters tried to compact too many themes, motifs, and character elements into a very small run time; it would have been more beneficial if these elements were spanned out across another movie (or two).
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game. It tests your patience, will, and intellect in a fun and rewarding way. I loved the mystery and storyline behind it as well. Great game for those who used to play ones like the eleventh hour and such. Definitely try not to use the hints, as the game is not long. I can't wait for the next one!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|What a great book! This really helped me understand this culture so much more with their traditions and everyday lives... definitely worth the read, highly recommended!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love Jack Reacher.  He's a super hero without the kryptonite. I know he's going to come out on top but I keep reading to find out how. I like that the sex scenes leave a bit to the imagination instead of every steamy detail.  Okay, so some things are a little off.  I grew up in the military and we moved every one to two years not evey three to six months, but that is a minor thing. After all, this is fiction.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book to see what trouble Jack gets into and out of. Thank you Lee Child for very entertaining reading.
B00863DOL0|5.0|I was surprised. This is the 3rd concert released by Blackmore's Knight and is easily the best. Ritchie may play mostly acoustic guitar, but he plays it very well!! The touch he uses rivals his early playing in Rainbow. Candice has a great sense of humor and a good voice. Overall I's call this a great DVD concert!
B009PJ1Q82|3.0|This film received some rave reviews, which influenced me to see it.  It is actually quite forgettable. I can't tell you now exactly what it was about, except that boy meets boy, love ensues, it's tested by drug issues, separation ensues, back together, and then finally a split. Did I miss something? The characters were not interesting enough for me to stay engaged. I remain ambivalent whether I liked it or did not like it. Judge for yourself.

B0064MT1U8|5.0|Forget the old-fashioned Saving Private Ryan. Shakespeare in Love was far and above the best movie of its year.  It was creative, speculative, funny, romantic, with superb acting giving us memorable characters:  Joseph Fiennes was a dashing young and struggling Shakespeare; Gwyneth Paltrow is marvelous as Shakespeare's muse Viola; and Judi Dench's all of &#34;eight minutes&#34; screen time as Queen Elizabeth is an unforgettable portrayal of the first Elizabeth. The ending, the final shots of Viola walking on the beach with Shakespeare's voice over, is an absolutely thrilling, romantic, and memorable scene that left me high. I left the cinema uplifted and happy. I finished the dvd first time uplifted and happy. I finished the blu-ray uplifted and happy, breezy, filled with a kind of joie de vivre.that few films ever give you. When I need to feel good, I put on Shakespeare in Love.  In my list of top ten films.
B00571F26Y|3.0|this was good information, however i felt the writer repeated things over and over to make a book. and just added words to fill pages
B0053O89KG|5.0|I got hooked on Castle from Season One.  Each season gets better. Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic make a great crime team, the police detective and the writer/detective. Castle's home life - his mother and daughter - makes for a funny side story. I'm waiting for Season 5
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a great game. Test your mind and skills could play it all day. Wanted the game to last longer.
B0079K4WEE|5.0|I missed this one in the cinema, but finally got this on dvd. It was stunning, an original premise - i.e., the loss of the senses one at a time - enagaging performances, with an ending that makes you rethink the film as a metaphor for what love is. There was something about it that lingers.... Highly recommended
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I read Frankl's work purely by accident.<br />Found in the back of our bookcase, left there by who knows who, the title struck me as, to be polite, presumptious.<br />After all, promising as much as the \\"meaning of life\\", in a small paperback, no less, is either an advertising trick or just plain ridiculous.<br />Isn't it?<br /><br />But of course, this is an old work and stumbling upon it years after the author has passed and reading and processing it through a thick filter of jaded cynicism is an even bigger mistake than the author's choice of title.<br />Why can't the meaning of life be found in a book?<br />Frankl clearly found the meaning of his, under circumstances that most of us, though having pretended to relate to them in so many film screenings, could never possibly conceive of.<br />Reading his words, you can understand the man behind the writing clearly.<br />Here is a writer with an idea, forged in the crucible of a concentration camp from which he emerged, not just scarred but also thankful for the opportunity given to him to help others and to find absolute strength in his beliefs.<br />He held to his beliefs in the possibilities of goodness and positivity in mankind, and whether or not one takes a historical view of the holocaust as whole, Frankl's views were vindicated in his own mind by the behaviour of his fellow prisoners in the camp.<br />From the view, he crafted a very simple philosophy / psychology.<br />And why can't these things be simple?<br />Our modern lives are complicated by technology and increasingly convoluted social interactions, yet at the core... what is really so complicated about life?<br />Perhaps the central teaching of logotherapy is to accept this simplicity.<br />Zen?<br />Reductionist?<br /><br />Frankl's ultimate idea is that the meaning of life is to find the meaning of YOUR life.<br />Strikes me as pretty dead on.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Not a great film, but outstanding and affecting.  Such a pleasure to see four of the great British actors doing ensemble work here: the great Maggie Smith, Pauline Collins, Billy Connolly, and Tom Courtney.  They are four opera singers now retired and working towards reprising their once famous quartet for a retirement home gala. We learn much about their lives and loves in the past, and it builds to a very touching finale. I was amazed by Tom Courtney, whom I remembered from my youth in the &#34;Billy Liar&#34; days. He has aged remarkably well and should do more of this kind of mature work.  I found the extras revealing. They all praised Dustin Hoffman as a very engaged director.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The best erotic series I have read!  Great series!  The characters learned to trust and love each other through everything!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game its the best the 1st time I played it took a while for the energy to go up but then I updated it and its even better. amazing game ever for free

B009EQG80W|5.0|I've given this book as a gift to many people.  Everyone gets something out of it.  The final third of the book is about grace/God.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This second book keep me at the edge of my couch and couldn't stop turning the pages.  Drove me crazy to try and figure out what was happening.  I cannot wait for the next book!  This is one of my top favorite series!!!
0893860468|5.0|We cannot know truth, we can only remove the false, then we see that we have been truth all along.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This a great book in my opinion with a great plot and characters.  Others I have read is just Sex Sex Sex and Sex with no plot or story!  This one keeps you wanting to know more....  Can't wait to read the rest...
B008XG1X18|1.0|Every time I am tap a thumbnail to view a larger image, it sends me back to original thumbnail NO MATTER HOW FAR I HAVE SEARCHED IN!
B00846REIS|5.0|This was an excellent book from the beginning!!!  Right from the start!  Sets the scene and starts you on a rollercoaster ride from the beginning!  GREAT!  This book is no where similar to Fifty Shades.  This story is in a class all my itself.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have played magic little by little ever since 3rd edition. I play magic online all the time. This game delivers on all the levels and satisfies all the magic playing needs when Friends are not around and Magic Online isn't. I also find the game great at introducing Magic to new players, well the basics anyway.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Not as intense or fast paced as the previous books.  Still entertaining but hopefully the upcoming books get back closer to the first two volumes in style.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I so like the adventure and puzzle game that's included.  Keeps you thinking and wondering what will come next.  Also great job with the graphics and looking forward unlocking the mystery.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Go with this album.  I really enjoy listening to this.  I got tired of hearing only parts of songs on the radio, so I opted to get this.  Im glad I did.  The convenience of the Amazon Player means that I get to listen to this anywhere I have an internet connection.
B000HEWEEE|1.0|The whole movie was very fuzzy, very blurry, which was SO disappointing! Was buying the full screen edition the problem? I don't know, but it shouldn't have been.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Now hear the originals.  This is really a fantastic collection.  It includes many of the classics that are commonly remade by other artists.  If you are curious, buy this, you will enjoy it.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I love historical fiction and Philippa Gregory never disappoints you. I know the story backwards and forwards of the 'War of the Roses' but Ms Gregorys' novels seem to make you feel that  you are right there with the characters. The only negative is the wait between her next new book.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|It works great. It was Just what I was looking for, and I would definitely recommend it. It is a great product.
B004AM5QT4|1.0|I just finished reading this book and I had to keep checking that it was actually written by Ken Follett . It was terrible! Three powerful men commit a genetic crime decades ago and then one of them hires a scientist to work on identical twins-huh??? There wasn't one character that I liked and they were all whiners. Granted this book was written 17 years ago- but I think we were all using cell phones, yet no one seemed to have one. I will continue to read Ken Follett novels- just not his old ones.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is awesome.  The product is simple and with the USB cable it can easily powered without taking up a wall outlet.  I was a little disappointed that the device wasn't powered by HDMI however I have a USB port on my TV right next to the HDMI ports so problem solved!  Those who purchase the product must keep in mind a couple of things:<br /><br />1) It requires an HDMI port to deliver content.  If you don't have an HDMI port in the path to your TV or receiver then you can't use this device.<br /><br />2) It's inexpensive and has a specific and focused purpose.  If you expect Chromecast to do everything including make coffee, you should return the device and go back to the previous technology you had before you bought Chromecast.  Chromecast's only purpose is to stream data to your television or stereo receiver automagically.  The point to this device is to get your content to your TV your way and not rely on devices like Roku or a build your own, premium channel / support everything, DVR.<br /><br />3) It requires software support.  Currently only the Google Chrome browser, Netflix App and Youtube App supports streaming to the device.  We need other App developers to support this product, including Hulu.  It is important to remember that anything that can be viewed in a Chrome browser can be viewed in Chromecast.<br /><br />4) There's no remote support, as designed.<br /><br />5) If you have a receiver that doesn't have HDMI ports you must either rely on the TV audio, get an HDMI Audio extractor or get a new receiver.<br /><br />6) The setup is simple and intuitive.  Google has made the software on Chromecast incredibly easy and technology newbie free.  Chromecast even updates itself automatically.<br /><br />Chromecast basically turns your HDMI ready TV into a Smart TV.  The potential is incredible.  In these times where we are told where we must watch, listen to and enjoy our media, Chromecast gives us freedoms that we never had before.
B00634GHJA|4.0|It would take a while. Overall a good app. Would recommend to all others. Would give it a for startNo t20
B000URWYTS|3.0|The architect Frank Lloyd Wright was a professional genius but a personal cad.  He was completely narcissistic in both relationships and financial matters.  I understand that creative people are often this way, but I just can't understand how they can take such advantage of people in their lives that help them or that they care for.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|It is never too late to do what you always wanted to try. I enjoy every part of this game... my toddler loves it too, I hope love for playing music can be instilled. Is easy and fun to follow. Thank you!
B0089LOG02|4.0|My grandmother was on an orphan train, so I was interested in what it might have been like.  Ms. Kline was fortunate enough to have been able to interview 6 of these people who are still alive.  She related some of their experiences in the stories of her characters.  The poor little children were often used and abused.  My grandmother always told us she was glad she was little so no one took her and she ended up in an orphanage at the end of the line.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|This was a really cute and amusing movie that was much more enjoyable than the preview led me to believe.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|We cant get enough of this movie! Hilarious! Our kids know most of the lines by heart at this point!
B001E75QGG|3.0|I was hopeful with this next installment of Indiana jones but alas this was a lack luster attempt and with a sci-fi twist. Didn't really see that coming. Who's idea was it to use even Stevens boy? I think the casting could have been a little more carefully considered because no one believes that he was a passable greaser.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This movie reminded me of some of the old film noir movies that were so great in decades past.  Catherine Zeta Jones played a great role!
B000ZELISO|3.0|I love the books but have become more increasingly disappointed with the movies. This movie left out many key points that in my opinion have much to do with the rest of the story. If you haven't read the books there is many questions left unanswered and you would be left wondering how did they come to that conclusion. Book was great movie was so-so.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|This movie was not totally believable, but is was fun to watch.  All the actors were excellent -- great for a rainy Saturday or Sunday!
B001KVZ6G6|2.0|Previews show funny and the movie is mostly all but that. If want a pity party movie this is the one for you.
0812973992|3.0|Didn't care for organization.  I read with lots of time-breaks between - pulling together all the pieces was okay but bothersome.

B002UHTTWQ|5.0|I love this book. It is my favourite. I haven't read it for quite a few years now so I am rereading it. I look forward to &#34;Hold the Dream&#34; when I am finished this one.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|What a legendary movie. Beautiful scenery of the French Riviera in the 1950's; beautiful clothes by Edith Head; the legendary actors of Cary Grant, Grace Kelly and Jessie Royce-Landis. And a little suspense thrown in by Alfred Hitchcock. This is a visual treat. Crystal-clear copy streamed by Amazon Instant Video. A movie not to be missed. The elegance and beauty of Grace Kelly is worth every second.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great app for school and/or work on both free and paid versions. No glitches or problems with this app at all.
B000002LIM|5.0|Was very happy to purchase for my sister for her birthday and very happy that this particular album came with an MP3 album through my online Amazons media library. If you want a good deal and the best music that defines the original cinema Batman then it has to be this album.

B003Y5H5B0|4.0|Okay,I will be the first to admit,I did not want to see this movie.I hate remakes or movies based on Tv Show.They always screw it up.They take everything you remember from the original and destroy.Perfect example was the Miami Vice movie.I rarely watch movies based on TV shows.<br /><br />When I saw the preview for this movie,I was like no way.It was like it had nothing to do with the original and in fact,was going to mock it.I have not seen the show in years but I know it was not a comedy.And this might seem lame,I hate movies with a lot of cussing.No,I am not a religious freak or anything.I just dont believe you have to say the F word 500 times to be funny.So i had no interest in this movie.<br /><br />Well,the last girl I was seeing told me to give it a fair try and I might like it.So one night off from work,I saw the Starz channel had it.I dont have Starz but did have Showtime and since Showtime and Time Warner are having contract issues,I got Starz for free.So since I was off work and neeed something to watch,I would give it a try.<br /><br />I will admit,I am the type that is not wrong with my first impression most of the time and not wrong often.But I was totally wrong about this movie.Yes,it has lots of foul language.But other then that,I laughed my tail off.<br /><br />I honestly think it would have been better if it was not called 21 Jump Street.Cause it didnt remind me of what 21 Jump Street was.It was a serious Tv Show.Not a comedy.But it was nice to see Holly Robinson Peete and Johnny Depp and that other guy,that Dom Delouise guy's son.Sorry 21 Jump Street fans,have not seen the show in years.<br /><br />That being said,I hope they make a part 2 and I am wanting to by the TV series on DVD.<br /><br />So I was wrong about this movie.Just for the record,it does have lots of foul language and not a movie for children.Other then that,great movie.
B0049J5EWW|5.0|A real classic, my kids loved as much as I did when I was small. Watching it on Amazon was so easy as well.
B00AYB0YFQ|5.0|Make sure you go to the bathroom before you watch and have lots of toilet paper with you because this movie will scare the shit out of you
B00A3YREFM|4.0|One of my favorite step-ups,  I'm a big fan of Katherine from &#34;So You Think You Can Dance&#34;.  This had a lot of really great group numbers, although a bit less on the solo's.  Very enjoyable
B005V5WBFG|2.0|Tried three times to load on my PC which has XP.  Worked fine on laptop with windows 7, my Kindle Fire Hd and my HTC IV cell phone.  Would not install on my PC.  They told me that I had \\" orphaned programs\\" and needed to call Microsoft.  For all I know they created the orphaned programs.
B0094M2UWG|4.0|Yes the plot is a bit predictable, but that's ok.  It's fun and enjoyable with plenty of good dancing.  If you're looking for a feel good dance movie this is great.
0307454568|4.0|Well worth the read....addictive brain candy! The geography didn't mean much to me, but the tenacity and cleverness of the main character did.
B00BVYU2P2|5.0|This is a decent enough show. It shows high school in a funny light. Witty. Though she gets a little annoying in the fact she gets what she wants and then changes her mind.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Facebook does not load correctly on my 7\\" Kindle Fire HD. It isn't useable at all using the mobile or full site option.

B000OBYLVO|5.0|As a guy, I will probably be laughed at for liking this movie. But you know what?! I don't care. I really liked this movie.
0786958731|5.0|Let me remind people before they start playing this. This game is hard in that things mainly don't go your way in the first place or frankly the whole game. But it's fun as hell getting owned though!
B0019NG73G|5.0|I bit the bullet and finally jumped to BLU-RAY, to start off, I've been replacing my top 10 movies with blu ray, when I saw the directors cut for sale, I jumped on it.<br /><br />lots more scenes with Sam Elliot and his great portrayal of Gen Buford, more scenes with Gen Reynolds, and a more put together film than the old DVD release, or the one shown on TV so many times<br /><br />very pleased, it's a longer movie now (Gettysburg is a long movie anyway) but this cut is awesome.<br />Very happy
B008602KQI|4.0|Unfortunately there were a couple turns and opportunities that they missed. Otherwise it was a good story and not too bloody.
B00AO3K01C|5.0|A very special read, quite unlike anything else I have read. I would love to see it made into a film.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|This is one of the all time greats!  I never tire of this movie. It will always be a favorite.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Good movie. Worth watching. I expected more action from watching the trailer, but would definitely recommend this movie one of MGM's best movies
0061950726|4.0|Beautiful, in a way that was rewarding to the soul. I'm reading that Orphan Train is being classified as Young Adult in some circles, but I thought it leaned more towards the flow and feel of Adult Fiction. This book was a form of instant gratification, with scenes that were painted crisply and without ambiguity, and writing that didn't spend it's time trying to be overly poetic. It's been a while since I've felt like I was reading for the pure pleasure of it, Orphan Train handed that joy back to me.<br /><br />Told from a first person account by 91-year-old Vivian, a widowed woman with a darkened and unfortunate past, and in third person by Molly, a 17-year-old raised by the foster care system. The two enter an unlikely friendship, and form an eventual bond, that has them discovering countless similarities, and revealing moments from their lives that they hadn't shared until now. Alternating between the 1930's to 2011, we become most acquainted with Vivian's 9-year-old self, and the long, and turbulent road she traveled as an orphan. In present time, Molly is experiencing obstacles that so mirror those in Vivian's past, and the soul healing is slow-building, and satisfying.<br /><br />The story Christina Baker Kline constructs in Orphan Train is impossible to tear away from, it is vividly drawn, and leaves you feeling more like a character in the book, rather than a bystander looking on. Her descriptions of young Vivian's continued hardships pierced my heart, and, interestingly enough, felt like they were heavily influenced by Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, and Roald Dahl's Matilda. At times, I felt like Vivian read more like an young adult of 16-17, rather than the 9 we were suppose to believe she was, but that didn't take away from the story.<br /><br />I admired the contrast she was able to achieve between the past, and present time. It's difficult to not allow one time period to bleed into the other when perspectives are changing each chapter, but this was done very smoothly. The conclusion was much appreciated, a little predictable, though it was the predictability that I think I most needed at that moment. Orphan Train was the kind of book your heart doesn't know it needs until your sitting there, completely immersed in every word.ut this was done very smoothly. The conclusion was much appreciated, a little predictable, though it was the predictability that I think I most needed at that moment.

B005HED11Y|4.0|See how it all began (except for the pilot which did not include much of the cast from the original series).  Hear Bones McCoy say &#34;He's dead, Jim&#34; for the first time. Watch as the characters try to start defining their characters. Great show.
140006922X|1.0|First, the disclaimers.  I am a Christian who has not yet purchased this book.  I want to, so that I can mark it up and \\"dog ear\\" it as I go through it line by line, but on the other hand, I am loathe to line the pockets of individuals like Dr. Aslan and the rest who make their fortunes publishing what I believe are questionable doctrines wrapped in the guise of popular narratives self-declared as \\"history.\\"  Nevertheless, I am reading it, courtesy of the Barnes and Noble \\"library\\" and the occasional venti cup of Starbucks-brand coffee served in their cafe.<br /><br />I find myself already flying to resources and research merely from wading through Aslan stumbling through the introduction.  One of the primary themes of this novel is to portray Jesus as a zealot who in effect logically and perhaps even naturally gets executed by the Romans.  Aslan cites various other characters from various sources who purportedly met the same fate as Jesus for making similar claims. Dr. Aslan endeavors to portray Jesus as conflicted, sending mixed messages as reported by alleged anonymous writers posing as various Apostles in today's canonical Bible.  For example, he characterizes Jesus as \\"sometimes promoting violence and conflict,\\" citing Luke 22:36 as evidence.  What he also does, however, is in effect cherry pick verses in the name of \\"scholarly\\" research, taking a single verse out of context to conform to his thesis.  It is as if Dr Aslan is confident that the vast majority of readers will gloss over the details that may in fact challenge his favored portrayal.  In other words, Jesus does indeed suggest to his Apostles to buy a sword, as Aslan highlights, but two verses later, when asked if two swords is sufficient, the Lord replies: \\"It is enough.\\"  Hardly the marching orders of zealot intent on overthrowing or even disturbing the Roman empire, but rather, a forewarning to disciples who soon would be threatened by those opposed to their evangelism.<br /><br />Others have pointed out the challenges Aslan faces in responding to debatable academic credentials.  Experience suggests that anyone in the public limelight who feels the need to be creative in that regard usually has other issues at play as well.  Regardless, a scripture keeps coming to mind every time I leaf through this tome.  Perhaps Dr. Aslan can appreciate this one as well.  Indeed, the Apostle Paul warned us of people like this, who are seemingly \\"always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.\\"  2 Ti 3:7 NIV.<br /><br />Alas, I suspect that I will indeed buy this book, not because I think that Dr. Aslan is endeavoring to shed light on an age-old debate, but rather, because he is either intentionally or unwittingly casting yet another shadow as part of the ancient deception to portray Jesus as anyone but other than who He truly is.<br /><br />Finally, as debate
1401322786|5.0|itch Album...................<br />  Perfect as always .<br />truly there is no need to read about&#34;&#34; this<br />author you need to read his work he is<br />truly a talent and i am very critical!
B005G4TJUC|4.0|I liked it was a good movie they did a good job on this movie it was funny and action packed. There is no problem with the disc so far it works just fine.
B007FQW7LM|5.0|Not sure exactly what it is, maybe just the silly whit in the lyrics definitely he is not a follower of the record businesses formula of what will sell on top 40 or even 10 how mundane. There is some great material here Kevin certainly cuts his own path of what he wants to play. Its Eno live album with him that got me interested in his music. Some of his best albums are found here.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Keeps the old grey matter working and at my age I need all the help I can get ;)<br />Brilliant for passing a few minutes here and there.
193700788X|1.0|Before reading the last book in the series, I spent the summer re-reading all the previous installments.  That being said, the last book felt like a fan fiction someone sloppily wrote in the middle of the night because he/she wanted Sookie to end up with a particular person.  We don't know what ended up happening to all of the influential characters in her life.  All of the super natural occurrences she has endured may as well not have even come to pass from how her life ended up.  Her life ended as if she never knew about vampires and werewolves and she was just a small time waitress in a small town with a boring life.  In the last bitter moments she learned nothing...felt nothing...and so did I.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It's not super user friendly and though the page layout is pleasing to the eye I find it difficult to understand the information I am seeking. Well I did at first, now I'm use to it. More than that, the weather is not as accurate as I would expect. I keep using it nonetheless and double check another source of I'm questioning the forecast or anxious about a particular day.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Always a classic, always enjoy it. We catch new funny things each time. It's one of the movies everyone should see.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Pretty good story. It's really only one book, not 5 or 6 like I thought it would be, but the author leaves it open at the end for more future books. Good pace throughout until the end, felt kind of rushed when he started to wrap it up. Strong characters that I wouldn't mind revisiting in future books.<br />I'd say go for it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great second book and continuing of the story!! Can't wait to read the third book and all of the others!
B0048KXRR6|5.0|We loved the first movie and were surpised by how much we loved the second. Great for big and little kids alike!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Me and my wife watch it together.  It's a good show. I would recommend this show just to break up the monotony between shows.
B009157BWU|5.0|Me and my kids really enjoyed watching this movie. I think we may want a chimpanzee now! Tim Allen did a great job narrating. We would watch this agan.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I was not a big fan of the ending.  The movie was really good It just had one of those weird endings this director is known for.  It was a good movie but I wouldn't watch it twice.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|I love watching these movies with my kids. I have loved all three of them. They have as well. Good famly friendly movie that  I never get tired of watching!
B00B23O96A|1.0|Eric Clapton did not work on this CD at all just rehashed music nothing of any quality. It was a total waste of my money!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A cool calculator and it looks really sharp on the kindle fire hd.  Very easy to use.  It is a great app!
B00008EY9G|4.0|I actually saw this movie on TV a few months back. It was late at night and I had nothing better to do so I just started watching it. About a half hour into the movie it started to get really good. By the end of the movie I couldn't believe what I just watched. This movie has three twists in it, with the first twist being the biggest mind screw, I like to call it the 180 twist. The theme of the story is loosely based on Agatha Christie's 'Ten Little Indians'. 10 strangers get trapped by a storm and have to wait it out at a nearby motel. One by one they start getting killed off. This may sound like the clich&eacute; \\"who dunnit\\" type of film noir that has become so familiar in most murder mysteries, but trust me, just when you think you know where this movie is going it will take you in a 180. You will not see this twist coming, and it's not a twist which damages the story line in anyway. As a fan of movies in general, but especially horror movies and psychological thrillers, I give 'Identity' 4 stars. This movie is well worth the watch!
B00EAI9CSY|2.0|I didn't care much about the characters, and I had trouble staying interested in the story. That said, it was an interesting concept and could have been excellent. I can't say for sure whether it was the script or the direction, which slowed it down so badly. The look of the movie was dark in a depressing way, not in the dark Yeary atmosphere that normally accompanies this type of film. I'm just glad we didn't pay multiples of $10 to see it in a theater.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love the Good Wife.  The characters are conniving, secretive, jealous, sneaky and wonderfully entertaining!  I wish Season 4 was available to Prime members!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book, I want a Christian Grey. I love Anastasia, love how she evolve from being too shy with Christian to standing up to him. Love how they compliment each other, n how they fell in love even though Christian doesn't know yet. It's a beautifully story, a lot different than what I usually read, but it's hot, and makes you want to experience New things.
B005V4ZEY2|2.0|Today I got an email from &#34;Amazon.com Reviews&#34; asking &#34;How many stars would you give 'Cerberus License Activation'?&#34;. I really don't know why amazon wants me to review the app if I haven't even received it, neither by mail or email. It was purchased 4 days ago, online. The 2 stars is for Amazon App Store, not for the behavior of Cerebrus software. And now when trying to contact before doing this review, to contact the seller through the amazon options it says &#34;We're sorry, We've run into a technical error. Please try again later.&#34; 2 days if been trying to use the option with no luck. If its an Amazon problem, come on, It says on your page &#34;Available instantly for your Android device&#34;. First and last time i will used Amazon too purchase apps for any of my 6 droid devices.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|As usual, Suits keeps the twists and suspense coming!  I love this season already and can't wait to see the rest
B009GEFXLC|5.0|If your a Castle fan, season 5 will not disappoint. I miss watching the show because I work evening but no worries as I know Amazon has the shows I miss and I am able to catch up on them on the weekend. Castle Season 5 is so worth the wait. Castle and Beckett's relationship has changed to a romantic one and seeing where it ends up makes the story lines all the more interesting.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It is a great movie. The acting was great, the action was super. It held my interest throughout. I'd recommend it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hands down best app to come out! There has not been one night where I have not played this game!
B0049J2BSM|4.0|Great kids movie with humor that makes it entertaining for the entire family. Wonderful movie for a fun family night.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|If u r bored at home, and like sci fi and don't mind predictable plots but are a huge fan of the genre<br />go for it!
B00BXKOMT6|4.0|Interesting read form the start & not what you expect. Lets you make up your mind whose right & wrong & leave's you asking questions so you keep reading to find the answers. Will certainly buy the next in the series: have to know how it ends
B004RL9T50|4.0|The underlying message in this movie is definitely nothing less than negative.<br />It just tells the kids that it wouldn't be such a bad idea to give the morally bad a chance to rule the world.<br />Full of occult symbolism and hidden messages.<br /><br />If u r a grown up and admire well created animation, don't miss it
B003JTHXOK|3.0|An updated version of the &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; story.  Predictable but a good way to pass a rainy afternoon.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Production and execuition is perfect<br />Rolls are amazing and the acting is neat<br />love it.<br />do not miss it<br />R
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Before I downloaded this program I couldn't get you tube videos embedded in Web pages to play. Now I can. Also love the feature that allows you to download YouTube videos as mp3s.
B00821OX98|3.0|All special effects, wrapped around a trite soap opera, placed inside an intergalactic war. Huh! A reworking of the old puppet-masters classic.
B006VREHRS|3.0|This series is well done but the anti Irish Catholic tone is typical of Hollywood scum. It's amazing how Hollywood is always pointing the finger at Irish and Italian mobsters when in fact it's the Kazar mafia. The Kazar Mob has always run the mafia and Atlantic City.
1452126607|5.0|Now there is not a day that will go by that  I wont be able to enjoy being hated by Grumpy Cat.
B000WYCF6Q|4.0|works fine, just small. not much else to say. what do you want to know? adjusts fine if a large object is behind you
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|THIS GAME IS AS INTRIGUING AS ALL OTHER G5 GAMES. THE GRAPHICS ARE  VERY, and THE GAME KEEPS YOU ON YOUR TOES AND MENTALLY GUESSING.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm not one to watch continuing dramas normally, but this beats all!  I have loved every minute of it!  Can't wait for Season 4!
B009R659L8|5.0|Wonderful mystery by Mary Higgins  Clark. No bad language. Short chapters.. always a surprise ending to find out who is guilty of the crime.
0385474547|5.0|This book is exactly what they advertised and I am very happy to have one signed by this excellent author.
B009JZXA0O|5.0|It's really the best movie of the series. I read all the books found that they stuck to the original story greatly. And would recommend this movie to anyone above the age of 13.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I enjoyed this book and will buy the rest of the series. I am glad this writer did not fall into the cliff hanger trap that seems to be the norm now. I like to look toward to reading more about this family.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great quality. No problems. We did not know exactly what to expect but it is great!. Can't wait for the next season.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|What a great read. I love these stories. Read this book you wont regret it. Great great great great great.
1613822286|1.0|Obviously a binding error with the book--it skips from page 54 to 85.  My daughter was reading this on vacation for the upcoming school year, and we will be stuck buying another copy because of the missing pages.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Rena Asian's book Zealot, The Life and Time of Jesus of Nazareth is an interesting take on the Jesus of History discussion.  His background of the political setting and conflicting forces in the time of Jesus sets the dynamics of Jerusalem and Israel in a compelling way. Asian details Jesus' ministry and his declaration of the Kingdom of God which threatened Rome to the extent that branded him a traitor and executed him.<br /><br />Where Asian goes wrong is his conflict between what passages in the Gospels he accepts as having some historical grounding ad those which no, thus arranging them to fit his arguments. I believe he is wrong in interpreting the Gospels as showing Jesus would take up arms against Rome and wanted to establish an independent \\"Kingdom of God\\" to free Israel from Roman oppression. Jesus was clearly a believer and practitioner of non- violence and sought through healing and feeding and liberating the poor and lame and oppressed to live in God's Kingdom.  By his marching on Jerusalem and disrupting the money lenders and tax collectors, he defied Rome in non-violent ways that demonstrated God's superiority over the powers of the Temple and Rome. Asian dismisses this unfortunately.  He also gets bogged down in Paul versus James too much<br /><br />Interesting but flawed look at Jesus of Nazareth.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This is one of the better Marvel movies. I Can't wait for the  next one to come out in 2015.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded on my Kindle Fire love it.  This game is highly recommended.  I play it all the time.  Get this one.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Great album, a lot of jazzy funk that ZZ top does. Now word filler for amazon one two three four or for?
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is an important book for everyone to read:  wonderfully woven tale of families torn by Afghanistan war, spot on historical significance, the plight of the burka women, death and survival, with poetic language that goes to the heart!
B009Z5975A|5.0|3 great movies. Now for some filler to make amazons word limitation count... one two three four five six seven
B004UID2LC|1.0|I loved watching videos with this app and using it to download videos but then as I started to use it more and more it got slower and so did my Kindle. It was almost like a virus for my Kindle. I deleted the app and my Kindle started getting faster every day. Don't get the app it is not worth the time.
B00008OWZC|4.0|Awesome Album. I recommend this album. Great music... great artist. You should add this cd to your library. I did.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|horrible. djdhd fish firm drank Dutch archbishop v fiscal Terrell Hegel Chen dad's scan celChen crib seek Dutch sexY search
B000VLE3GA|4.0|This album has some of the best and memorable hits from Led Zeppelin. There are good fast songs, good slow songs, and everything in between.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game.. I totally think paying for it was worth it there's nothing locked or nothing else u have to pay for I recommend this game to all ages
1932735410|5.0|Great study guide for your pmp cert. Now for some filler words to satisfy amazon one two three four five six seven eight nine
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a really fun game... u will like it!! u have lots of fun and have some cool chalenges.. love it!!!! hope u do too.
B005LAII4E|5.0|The movie was good. I like the actors in it, but the story line was a far off. Lots of action, cool boy toys
B000005S27|5.0|Apart from the fact that the actual cd holder was cracked, i have no complaints. Excellent service, CD itself as described, i can recommend you to anyone and will be happy to purchase from you again. It would be even better if you would consider shipping to Kenya.!!<br />Thanks.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|This is a better value than buying one battery at a time at Rite Aid or CVS. The batteries are 1st rate and they are working as expected. When you need them you need them.
B005MLP71Y|4.0|As an entomologist, it makes me cringe to see male bees depicted as the worker bees.  However the humor and the message are appealing and make it enjoyable for adults.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|My wife and I are hooked can't wait till season 3 is out. Now for some filler words to satisfy amazon one two three four five six seven eight nine
B005UG542S|4.0|Lots of action, a good wrap up to the series.  The book tied up all the threads of the storyline, and the movie was pretty faithful to that.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|this is a must watch… great story, impeccable directing and acting. I need to write 9 more words in here.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|I liked the movie even more after I watched it a 2nd time.<br />Acting was good, good story line, plenty of action.<br />Saw it first in movies then watch last night with kids and they loved<br />it. Even thought I had to go into long discussing about Hasbro with them.
B00B7IJBUY|2.0|I was hoping for something other than sleepy whispering vocals and where is Richie?? The guitar is so minimal for such an amazing player. The last few albums have been a big letdown and this one is the same way.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|I got the blu-ray and took me months to watch but I enjoyed it.<br />Maybe the music it had in it helped. There is a story if you watch the whole movie.<br />Its a love story. What do you want from a chick flick. Was going to get the soundtrack but not all songs in movie on soundtrack. Kevin Nash was in the movie.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Great movie, hope for a sequel. Action packed. Finally Cruise has made a good movie rather than his latest crap.
B005LAII4E|3.0|I thought it was okay.<br />How can the star of movie die in beginning of movie.<br />Had this talk with kids unless Channing Tatum is snake eyes.<br />Since we didn't see them together in the movie.<br />I thought the story was bad but I did enjoy the Rock. Is is getting to<br />be a better actor.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Another great film like Casino or GoodFellas. a must see movie. It never disappoints I can watch it all day long.
B005EWDAFQ|5.0|More on the lines of Michael Crichton than Harris's other work so far. Plausibly plotted even if (thankfully) only fiction about how an artificial intelligence can run amok, but this time in a world we don't often associate with such threats/risks - the world of finance and millisecond trading. I raced through it in less time than it took the market to melt down.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great movie, I would recommend it to anyone. Now if Amazon could reduce the limitation on what I have to type.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|We watched it as it was the basis for a children's sermon and the regular sermon at church. It's excellent and delivers a powerful message for those who like the kind of movie that has a heart for every age.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie. I've been a bond fan forever it seems.  Daniel Craig does a great job. The ending is a surprise.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just started playing this game today and I'm not quite getting what I'm supposed to do in the Vector Battle....he's flying along side me in his space ship and his drones are chasing me.....what do I do?!  LOL!!!  Am I just dodging and avoiding them?  Or do I take them out somehow?
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Great movie, I would recommend it to anyone. Now if Amazon could reduce the limitation on what I have to type.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandson has this on his moms phone and uses all lot of her time in minutes to play.  I let him download it to my Kindle and it is wifi which is a better way to play.  And like all games a time limit for the day must be monitored.  He lovves this game.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Yet another great show from BBC. I love the characters, incredible depth to each of them. A must watch series.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My grandson loves this game.  He would play all day if allowed.  Like with any game we monitor how long he plays anything.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Buble returns to form with this CD. The last release, 'Crazy Love', was a little bit of a let down for me.<br /><br />His 2011 Christmas was very good with the exception of the song 'Santa Baby', which I didn't really like.<br /><br />Having seen him live twice I felt this set of music fits his live performances better. His voice was very good on this CD and the arrangements are spot-on. I kind of think his voice has matured as he gets older and that's a good thing.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />This CD came quickly in perfect condition and was at a very good price ($9.99).<br /><br />I would rate this a 9.0 to 9.5 out of 10 stars.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|A little on the heavy side. Written by a very intelligent man but a lot more technical than I needed. I believe he had the experience but would of liked him to get his point across more as a person instead of a doctor.
B004BLDD9Y|4.0|Cheaper than we can buy at our local stores, even with the rebates from PG&E, and they cut down on the heat from other bulbs significantly.
B000KIPT30|5.0|does exactly what i need it to do. hooked up the headphone out on my mixer to this thing and split the headphone put into 4 outs.<br /><br />would buy again!
B00022GJ4M|5.0|This is a classic. The band that Winter assembled is fantastic. Muddy never sounded better and the tracks are all top shelf. This is my favorite Blues CD ever. You have to listen to it in its entirety to fully appreciate it. The sound mix really works and the chemistry among the Band is amazing. Buy It.!!
B008XG1X18|2.0|I keep restarting it and reinstalling thinking maybe this time it will work but no. crashes and freezes a lot and doesn't show boards when I click on a pin to pin it. please please please fix. when it works its so much better than the actual website.
B00COCY67A|5.0|always. this is a nicely assembled package of mostly outtakes. well-selected outtakes. the remastering is pretty flawless. some great mixes here, including of promised land. buy.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I find this game interesting and it really holds my attention. I feel that it keeps me mentally fit. There are some objects that I can't seem to find though.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book had my heart tugging. It's truly brilliant and I adore it! It's a slow read at first, but it's amazing. I love how the story doesn't just describe Francie's thoughts and point if view, but bits of other people too. I love this book, and I hope you do as well :)
B00018D3RI|4.0|Two brave, correct and fun cops, against crime and corruption. Action, emotion and fun insured. Very recomendable for all ages.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great brainteaser game. its not too hard like others so you don't get frustrated with it. its just right.
0316228583|2.0|I loved the harry potter books growing up, and as I became and more discerning reader, I was able to set aside the problems with the writing to enjoy the story.<br /><br />Not so with this book.<br /><br />I get the impression that Rowling tried to fit every adult or real-world scenario that she had ever wanted to write about but which wasn't appropriate in the world of Harry Potter into one book. The result is sprawling, messy, and ultimately unmoving. There are a lot of characters, and by the end, I didn't really care about any of them.<br /><br />It sound's like Cuckoo's Calling is a much better effort, and a better representation of Rowling's voice in adult fiction.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Not quite as good as The Kite Runner but equally well written. A bit harder to follow than his earlier work, but a very compelling and emotional  story with well developed characters and great insight through several generations of a family split up by need and circumstance.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|With TV shows on hiatus for the summer, I decided to go back and view some old episodes. The characters are real and believable.
B005IF7TCE|5.0|This mic is pretty good, my friends could hear me good but it was a little hard for me to hear them if they were talking lower, but for the price its pretty good. it came as described by seller and even came a day or two early. I would recommend this to anyone.
B006WZLCZ4|4.0|We bought my daughter the Hape refrigerator and stove/sink combo.  This set goes very well with it.  The utensils fit perfectly in the slots above the sink.  Appears well made.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I like the idea its cute if it would work. I have only played the game very few times. Cannot say game play has problems can't get there
B001VFGL4W|5.0|The Title of this review says everything that needs to be said. If you're looking for something on caliber with the greatest albums from Tool, Nirvana, RHCP, Zeppelin, The Beatles, Pink Floyd than this would and should be considered Deftones classic and most important album.
B00129H7VS|5.0|BOB is simply the best mini series ever!  Excellent blu ray transfer as well!  If you are a WW2 buff?  This needs to be in your collection!
B004TI5N38|5.0|ANOTHER VERY LIKEABLE CHARACTER & FASCINATING STORY LINE.  THERE A SOME REALLY NASTY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, AREN'T THERE?  WE MEET SOME PARTICULARLY NASTY ONES IN THIS BOOK.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|This has always been Spielberg's underdog movie.  This movie has stunning cinematography.  Great for WW2 buffs as well to have a better understanding of the impacts of the WAR in Asia.  Two thumps way up!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|THIS MAN WRITES THE ABSOLUTE BEST INTRIGUE NOVELS.  SINCE I ALREADY THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS OUT TO GET US & THEY DO ALL SORTS OF UGLY THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T & USUALLY GET AWAY WITH THEM (I SAID I WAS PARANOID).  THESE BOOKS ARE THE BEST.  THEY SEEMS TO JUSTIFY THE PARANOIA.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|The only reason I say pretty cool is because at first it's insane but after a while you will forget all about it and not play it again.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I REALLY LIKED THESE CHARACTERS.  WHICH IS KIND OF STRANGE, WHEN YOU CONSIDER OUR MAIN MAN IS A GOVERNMENT HIT MAN.  BUT HE KNOWS RIGHT FROM WRONG.  NO, REALLY.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|While this series is a little derivative, what police show isn't?  It did break some ground, though - it definitely influenced the cop shows that followed it.  The characters are fairly complex.  Worth watching.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Everyone in the family likes playing this game...lots of different vehicles and scenes to try to beat.  Nice for a free game.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This whole series is great. City of Ashes met me expectations for the 2nd book. It had the suspense, keeps you on your toes, can't put it down!!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very addictive and challenging.  Lots of fun too!  Love the different levels and no delays in the game. Would recommend to my friends
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Very fun game. No internet or mobile data required to play which is great.  I would recommend this game to everyone.
B001TMFFSA|3.0|The book is for my grandson. He also has to read this one for school and make a report. the book was in ok shape. I do plan on reading it also.<br /><br />  Thanks,<br />  Gayle Pursley
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|Vince really delivers on this latest project.. not surprising, but impressive still. played it through front to back and then over again!
B001FGD19A|4.0|It was in great shape. My grandson has to read it for school, than I will. It was mailed quick.<br /><br />  Thanks,<br />  Gayle Pursley
B007N31YH0|5.0|I have seen the move several times, but wanted a copy of my own...also, loved the music accompanying it...Marvin Hamlisch was the best...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is lots of fun. it really makes you think. I would definitely get it again. _great memory puzzles.<br />love it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow it made me realize what they go through. I never knew how tough till that book. All I can say is you won't get disappointed that's for sure
B007NESBK2|5.0|A must have if  you love listening to nice vocals along with a superb band that  together combine  to  put  on a great show.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|horrible! Makes Me Hate Humanity. Maybe It Is To CLose To Real Life When You Are A Horrible Person. Kate Hudson's Worst Work.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|I thought this would allow access to my dropbox but it didn't. It has the same name, but I can't access my material. It's kind of a bummer that Kindle doesn't have a drop box app especially if they are in competition with the rest of the tablets. :(
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift, for my nephew.  I didn't  watch it, it's not exactly my kind of movie.
B007W4OZ76|2.0|The dropbox app said that I needed this app to use drop box... so I downloaded it. It still didn't help my drop box.
B00993FEUK|5.0|I run a Movies In The Park  program in our Borough.  I have to pick appropriate for elementary thru middle school age groups. Then My wife and I have to watch them, before we show them to the kids.  I don't need phone calls from parents, asking me what kind of movies I'm showing.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Mr. Martin continues to keep us guessing as to who will survive and who will perish.  The characters are imbued with humanity as well as cruelty yet we are constantly cheering them on.  The backdrop is visceral and entirely real.  It makes the television &#34;Survivor&#34; episodes seem like a cookie bake for the Girl Scouts.  As an avid follower, I am very much looking forward to the next book.  I'm sure that it will be much and more.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|My wife and I watched it once by our selves, then we watched it with her aunt and uncle.  We all thought it was fantastic.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great fun and a bit frighteningly believable<br />U cannot mandate # of words; why would u?.<br />#'s discourage creativity<br />Who
B000UU4NE4|5.0|Bought this movie for my grandson who has seen it at least 10 times. I watched it with him a couple times and the fact he likes it is all I need to know.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Hope next season does not disappoint<br />U cannot mandate # of words; why would u?.<br />Quit with the numbers damn it
B004HWT6DO|5.0|I am a total Zuckerberg fan and this movie is a glimpse into the beginning of Facebook. The accuracy can be debated but it tells the story of a guy with no social skills who invented the greatest social network of our time. The acting is great and the story is complex, and when you see what Facebook has become versus where it started is nothing short of phenomenal. Geek or not this is a good movie.
B0069U5CT4|5.0|This colored lp is amazing! Prompt customer service and the lp doesn't sound bad at all! The quality is very high!
B002X6PTH8|5.0|Bought this for my grandson who has seen it at least 10 times. We both repeat lines from it all the time and is my favorite Jim Carrey movie
