B00011F5DK|5.0|this game requires a person to plan ahead, think strategically, and improve spacial and geographical relations.  My daughter started playing it at age 7.  she loves to play with it by herself and with others.  the only downside is that there are a lot of pieces but that wouldn't stop me from purchasing it again.

1416955070|4.0|Okay, so maybe this isn't the best book out there but it is actually quite engaging and makes you want to keep reading. It has its faults but I like it enough that I have read the sequel (haven't read the 3rd yet, but I will). I really like the characters and you'll want to find out how each one develops and how their relationships evolve. Now that I'm thinking more about it, I actually like these books a lot but it just needs something that I can't put my finger on. But overall a good read and I recommend it.
B001GCUO16|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie. My wife and I went to see it while away from the kids for the night. I enjoyed the previous x-men movies (except number 3) and figured this had to be a better movie. It was dull beyond comparison. Blowing stuff up and non-stop fighting is getting old in the movies. We've seen it, we know what computers can do. There was virtually no character development whatsoever. Those of us who know the X-men want to know more about their lives, not just who they can fight. The entire story was incredibly predictable, so much so, that it got so painful to watch we didn't even stay for the last 15 minutes and asked for our money back.<br /><br />Yeah, there are some sharp effects, but other than that this movie scores as mundane and uninspiring. 2 stars. I expect to see it in the $5.00 Walmart bin within the year.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Should \\"The Dark Knight\\" have been nominated for best picture?  Since I didn't see any of the nominees, I could not honestly say that one of the five should be withdrawn so this movie could have taken its place.  But it was worthy of a nomination.<br /><br />I read a movie reviewer say that the book can be closed on the Joker after such an effective performance.  This was in '89, speaking of Jack Nicholson's performance.  I bet that reviewer is eating his words after the late Heath Ledger's deserved supporting actor nod.  Actually, though, the Joker as portrayed by Nicholson and Cesar Romero (as well as the animated version voiced by Mark Hamil) focused on being the clown side, while Ledger's portrayal was more like the Joker in a card deck, an unpredictable wild card.<br /><br />This movie was full of effective plot twists.  Thus, I will not be dealing much with the plot because I hate spoiling surprises.<br /><br />The main point is this movie makes you think.  There are many quotable sound bites in this picture.  There have been other comic book movies that succeeded at being thoughtful (such as the X-Men series, especially X-3), but this sets the bar.<br /><br />I will say this movie deserves its PG-13 movie.  I feel this movie is inappropriate for children, and I would recommend parents see this with their teens instead of letting them go with their buddies, because this not only has graphic violence (though not R-rated, but close), but there are great discussions that a parent can have with their teenager as a result of this movie that shouldn't be missed.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|The heart of this film is in the title--\\"The Reader.\\" If you're looking for a Holocaust picture, this really is not it, but it's mentioned. If you're looking for a period film, NOT THIS, it covers every decade from the 50's to the 90's. It's a movie hard to categorize other than \\"astonishing depth\\" for looking deeply into the psychological make-up of several leading characters. The activity of \\"the reader\\" at different segments of Hanna's life helps makes this story so intriguing.<br /><br />It begins with a teenage Michael Berg (David Kross) becoming ill in the alley and an mid-30's, Hanna, helps him home.  This chance meeting sparks an affair. Hanna (Kate Winslet, \\"Titanic\\") shares her body in trade for Michael reading to her. The affair ends suddenly, but not in the heart and mind of Michael.<br /><br />The movie travels 5 decades. An early 90's decade scene has older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) planning to meet with his daughter. Michael is obviously troubled, struggling within himself, but why? The movie tell WHY! It tells of multiple relationships with \\"The Reader.\\"<br /><br />Kate Winslet's performance is the driving force and success to this thought stimulating story. It's why she won the Oscar and many other awards for her role in \\"The Reader.\\" She stated in the bonus material, \\"It (this film) doesn't answer any questions.\\" Another great summary line from the screenplay writer (David Hare), \\"How do you live in the shadow of one of the greatest crimes in human history?\\" \\"The Reader\\" asks questions, but lets the viewer think of possible answers, or why?<br /><br />After watching during an evening, my night was filled with pondering, dreaming, and my own inward struggle dealing with the issues of the film's main characters. This movie does that to you.  Not exactly entertaining, but surely and hugely thought provoking. Call it a masterpiece.<br /><br />There are many Special Features on the DVD including \\"Deleted Scenes\\" (a great many, & very worthwhile). \\"Kate Winslet On The Art Of Aging Hanna Schmitz\\" also indicates the Winslet nudity is not all real. This bonus segment is important to see just how Kate was able to so successfully portray a 36 year-old, and then age each decade, until her final scene where Hanna's age is her late 60s. Incredible make-up, incredible acting.  5 additional bonus features.<br /><br />English and Spanish Subtitles are available.<br /><br />Bottom line...this is a movie to own for repeated viewing and loaning to friends. Or do the gift thing.\\" also indicates the Winslet nudity is not all real.

B000T9OP7G|4.0|The first (pilot) episode is kinda rough; they time travel, and almost jump the shark, but the show gets better from there.       Summer Glau does a great job as the terminator Cameron. She does the whole detached from reality thing pretty d*** well. Strange roles seem to work out for her. Because she's a terminator, Summer's character has no social skills to speak of (she can mimic people, but doesn't know the meanings of the actions she's mimicking), which leads to some pretty funny moments, especially when she goes to school (to protect John and to make her seem like a normal teenage girl).      Lena Headey makes a believable Sara Connor. Her acting never really wavers, and she shows her characters internal conflict pretty well. She doesn't have the intensity of Linda Hamilton (the original Sara Connor from Terminator 1 and 2), but her character is not going full blast all the time, so it works out in the end.      Thomas Dekker also makes a believable John Connor. While everyone's character goes through emotional conflict (minor exception for Summer Glau/Cameron; it makes more sense the more you watch it), John Connor gets the worst of it. He does a good job showing the stress he's under from being the savior of mankind, being hunted by terminators, and even school events (a girl commits suicide, and John could have saved her).       The special effects are both good and bad. You can see the work that went into making the CGI models, but it's painfully obvious that it's CG; when there is a shot of a terminator with no human skin, you know they green screened it in. Aside from that, the special effects are more than solid. The action scenes are basic, but well done and well thought out.      The plot, from episode to episode as well as from beginning of the episode to the end, flows very well. It's not the kind of show you can watch a few episodes of here and there; each builds upon the last, so you have to pay attention, although you don't have to take detailed notes to understand what's happening.      Ultimately, this is a very good show that Fox shouldn't have canceled (just like Firefly). If you're a Terminator fan and don't mind this being non-canonical (it's ultimately a giant, well written fan fic), I highly recommend it. If you're looking for a good TV show to get into, this is the show you want to watch.

B001VLBDD0|5.0|This \\"Extreme DVD\\" edition of \\"Terminator 2\\" was already released a few years ago so if you already own it, skip this re-release.  However, this DVD is a shining example of delivering what DVD (and Blu-Ray for that matter) should.  There are great \\"making of\\" extras, an interactive \\"pop-up\\" feature, a fantastic James Cameron commentary and other extras that make this a can't miss purchase.<br /><br />The \\"Extreme DVD\\" edition of \\"Terminator 2\\" adds a number of scenes to the theatrical version that clear up some of the questions I had.  For example, in the scene where the T-1000 has Sarah call for John in the steel mill.  I always wondered why it didn't just kill Sarah and imitate her voice and appearance.  As it turns out, this occurs after the T-1000 has been frozen, shattered and reformed.  Several moments in between these events reveals that the liquid terminator is malfunctioning which could explain why it needed Sarah to call out to John.  It isn't just a case of being afraid to kill off main characters after all.<br /><br />\\"T2\\" is another James Cameron classic and if you haven't seen it you're missing out on a great film.  And you should see it on this \\"Extreme DVD\\" edition.
B00003CWNR|1.0|This film depicts likeable people caught up in circumstances where it seems not only normal but legitimate for them to lie, commit suicide, commit abortions, engage in incest, commit murder, live a lie (the main character finally \\"chooses\\" to go back to his old orphanage and pretend he is a doctor using a fake diploma), betray a close friendship, fornicate,...you name it: everything people shouldn't do is done.<br />The workers who work seasonally picking apples at an apple orchard in Maine have some rules tacked to their wall which they scorn. Eventually, the rules are thrown in the fire, and the head apple picker says, \\"The rules were written by people who don't live here; we live here....\\" This is a metaphor for the movie.  All the rules about morality are inherited from others who don't live here on planet Earth in the good old USA now.<br />Therefore, those rules don't apply. This is the kind of existentialism that traces back to Albert Camus' novel The Stranger where the characters are reacting to circumstances, even the main character who is eventually tried for murder. They are just people caught up in living their lives. Any attempt to judge them by rules or a moral standard is bogus.<br />The thing about this movie if you just look at it uncritically and enjoy the beautiful scenery, the beautiful looking actors and actresses, and the personalities, all of whom seem superficially likeable and attractive, you might not notice that they have broken every rule in the book, every rule of morality or Judeo-Christian morality, whatever you want to call it. Therefore the movie ultimately makes bad seem good, and I don't recommend it at all. Truly a morally degraded and degrading film.

The wide range of personal stories and aura of mystery surrounding the reclusive running people will leave you glued to the page, thirsting for adventure, and itching to hit the trail.  McDougall, though overdramatic and sometimes less-than-eloquent, has plugged into the true runner's psyche.  A must-read.
B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|This was a fun movie, fast paced, and thrilling. The creators wanted a successful reboot of the franchise, something that was accessible to Trek fans and non-fans, and they succeeded in creating a enjoyable popcorn movie, well worth seeing.  But it could have been great.  They sacrificed plot for style and they could have had both.  There are too many plot holes and not enough effort spent setting up the motivation of the villain for this to be a truly memorable movie.  Enjoyable but not great.  Still, I look forward to the next installment.

B001TODCII|2.0|I give it 2 stars because of the setting in Paris, which is always nice to look at.  The whole premise might have been a little more interesting if we had not just seen a \\"Frontline\\" special about girls enticed into jobs and being taken into prostitution instead, captive in Turkey.  No $500,000 price tags on those girls.  Liam Neeson is over the top in the action scenes, destroying everything he comes into contact with, all of a sudden is supposed to be French without speaking it, (he does try to speak Albanian - by the way, Albanians seem to be the last group you can be politically incorrect about) kills everyone he sees no matter how outmanned he is, even shoots someone's wife for no real reason -  it is a joke!  And at the end he comes home free and clear without any ramifications of the destruction he has left behind.  We laughed all the way through it.  At least 007 is supposed to be funny!  And what mother in her right mind would let her daughter (age 17) go to Europe to follow a rock band around with another girlfriend?
006091307X|4.0|The Crying of Lot 49 puts me in mind of the classic film, Citizen Kane. Both have an enigmatic \\"great man,\\" deceased, lurking in the shadows of the story -- Pierce Inverarity and Charles Foster Kane. Both have a cardboard cutout of a character pursuing the meaning of the man -- Oedipa Maas and Thompson, the reporter. Both serve up a tantalizing key to that meaning -- Tristero and Rosebud.    Pierce Inverarity died a few months prior to the beginning of CL49, leaving his former mistress, Oedipa Maas as his executor. He had amassed great wealth in real estate and Oed thought his lifestyle would provide escape from the gray Eisenhower years of her life. She found he was more absorbed in his stamp collection than with her, but also came to realize that the lifestyle which transported her to exotic locales in Mexico provided only the illusion of escape. She returned to her world of tupperware parties, where we first meet her, recovering from the spiked punch they offer.    We see no depth to her character and relate to Oedipa mostly through her role in searching for meaning in one person's life. Ostensibly, that would be Pierce Inverarity's, but it is also potentially her own and, by extension, our own. The key to unlocking the enigma is Tristero and the keyhole is first exposed with the cancelled stamp marked \\"Report All Obscene Mail to Your Potsmaster.\\" This misspelling starts her on a path through the brown conformity of southern California, finding stepping stones of non-conformity amidst the military industrialism of the Yoyodyne corporation, the ticky-tacky housing and resort developments of Pierce Inverarity.    Tristero links these pockets of non-conformity through its secret mail system which sprang up in opposition to the monopoly of the European state-endorsed  postal system. The downtrodden, those at the edge of society, those with a severe mistrust of the established order use the American incarnation of Tristero to communicate with each other.    Pynchon creates a bridge between the engineering and literary worlds by introducing entropy as a motif in his story. Notoriously confusing, entropy is clarified by a recent interpretation as a measure of freedom. Entropy in nature tends to increase, but can be locked in a stasis. An ice crystal remains rigidly frozen until it receives a small amount of melt energy. Entropy decreases temporarily with the addition of this energy, but then increases dramatically when the water molecules are freed to move out of their locked position in the crystal. One can also imagine that, with the right activation energy, the rigid grid of drafting tables of the Yoyodyne engineering department can be freed to form a society for creative invention.    Pynchon closes his book with an image of brilliant points of dust dancing in a patch of sunlight outside the door to the auction room. As the door closes on Oedipa, we wonder whether she can use Tristero to free herself from herself, to dance on the light beams of imagination, or that this quest is just another illusion of escape.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Wall-E, as presented in the Blu-Ray format, shows the full muscle of what the latest format in video technology presents. Disney's Pixar holds no punches when it comes to using the best compressor codecs and as such the results are stunning. The images are clear and ultra-crisp, even on my LG 52\\" LCD TV.     The only quirk that I have is a conglomeration of technology issues which comes down to the fact that on my laptop I have HDMI output and normally it can't output to my TV any Blu-Ray content. It is called HDCP protection and is a pain in the butt for home viewing. AnyDVD is a product that allows you to watch Blu-Ray content outputted to your TV through your existing HDMI connection so it basically allows the HDCP protection to work with your devices. Wall-E along with other movies are encoded with Dolby DTS-HD audio, which even with the best software out there, is no match for the HDCP protection. It will output the video portion of the movie and the sound will stay on my laptop.    But with all the technical jibber-jabber aside, this 3 disc version of Wall-E is probably one of the better releases that Disney has. The packaging is professional and looks good stacked up with the rest of your Blu-Ray/DVD collection. So if you are trying to show off your new big-screen TV and have Blu-Ray capability then Wall-E is a fine addition to your movie arsenal. You won't be disappointed!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|After the disappointing use of DIE ANOTHER DAY ( I would personally like to add that that was not a way for Pierce Brosnan to end as James Bond after all his other good ones) I was real skeptical to continue with the james bond franchise. My roommate had told me about Casino Royale but I was not interested. But then my friend of 5 years of college was telling me about it, and this was around the time that Quantum of Solace was coming out in theaters, so I decided to watch it, hoping that I was not disappointed.    I would like to point out that now I own Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. I like this new bond, Daniel Craig. I remember seeing him in the first Tomb Raider movie alongside Jolie, and when I was seeing the movie, I was thinking this guy looks familiar. But along with the movie. Well, those of you that are fans of the james bond franchise, you would know that the movies always start of with the gun barrel. Well, not this one. Keeping in mind that this is a reboot of the franchise, this movie is his very first mission. All throughout the introduction (opening sequence) I asked, \\"Where is the gun barrel?\\" and then a moment later, we see james bond picks up a gun, and the guy behind him tries to shoot james bond, but then the view shifts to the gun barrel and james bond shoots the guy. To this day I think that was the perfect use of the gun barrel. The rest of the movie is real good: see for yourself what happens. I think this is the best plot in the franchise, and fans will not be disappointed.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|300 is a fun movie which if you don't know what it's about I suggest that you look up a synopsis at [...] or another movie site. As far as the quality and the \\"worth-it\\" factor of the movie it is definitely top notch. However, to get the picture to look optimal on my TV (LG's 52LG70) it didn't look its best right out of the box. I had to tweak the various settings in my TV for this movie. I would venture to say that this is due in part to the fact that 300 uses a unique color scheme and requires a bit of tinkering around to get it to show off its true colors (no pun intended).     The movie in its full glory looks realistic and is of higher quality then what you had in the theater. So all in all it is a good buy and a strong addition to your Blu-Ray collection.

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|After releasing ten films under the banner of `Star Trek', along with four television spin-offs, the novelty of this once proud brand name appeared to be wearing off. This in light of the fact that the latest entries for both mediums met with less than stellar critical and commercial success (\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" and TV's \\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\" respectively). It seemed that perhaps the franchise and its audience needed a break, and possibly a fresh, new approach if it was to ever find success again. Which brings us to the here and now, the summer of 2009, seven years after the last feature film and four years since the last TV spin-off aired its final episode, and we finally have a new \\"Star Trek\\" film once more boldly going where no man has gone before. Under the care of wunderkind producer, writer and director J.J. Abrams (TV's \\"Lost\\" and \\"Mission: Impossible 3\\"), along with screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (\\"Transformers\\"), the dormant franchise has been resurrected, returning it to bask in the glory of critical praise and commercial success, an achievement that has been absent from the franchise for quite some time.    \\"Star Trek\\" focuses, once again, on the Federation starship Enterprise and its original crew of Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Sulu (John Cho), McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and more. When a deadly new Romulan menace, led by a vengeful despot named Nero (Eric Bana), threatens the entirety of the Federation, Starfleet must rally its forces, including the recently completed Enterprise, to combat this alien danger before it's too late.    As a fan of the majority of the \\"Star Trek\\" films (aside from \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" and \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\"), and generally enjoying the direction the latter films had been taking (\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" being my favorite entry thus far), I was a little unsure about the prospect of essentially restarting the franchise from scratch. However, since this approach has proven successful over the last few years with other franchises that I enjoy, for example the Batman and James Bond series', I thought that if in fact the well had run dry in regards to further adventures set beyond the events of the tenth film, then perhaps this decision may work out alright after all. Of course that success would all depend on who was going to be responsible for taking the series back to its roots, so to speak.    Let me say that any lingering doubts or concerns I had in regards to this film and its chances for success were quickly laid to rest when word was released that writer/director/producer J.J. Abrams would be helming this installment. Abrams had proven himself quite the capable writer and producer with his various television projects and screenplays, so I knew that he would most likely not sit idly by if the story was lacking in any way. Yet, it was his work helming the very entertaining, third \\"Mission: Impossible\\" film that gave me even greater faith in his ability to guide the Enterprise back into the spotlight once more.    On top of the fact that such a multi-talented person of J.J. Abrams' caliber would be directing the eleventh entry into the venerable series, was the announcement that the series would not only serve as a reboot of sorts, but it would still recognize the films that have come before it; instead of just ignoring them altogether which is what most of the reboots have done. Crafting this epic story was the writing duo of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman, along with Abrams, were sensible enough to not only cater to the hardcore fans of the show and its subsequent movies and television spin-offs, but also make the story accessible to a whole new generation of moviegoers that may not have been previously interested in anything related to `Star Trek'.    The plot of \\"Star Trek\\" meets all the necessary criteria for the making of a massive summer blockbuster. Featuring plenty of drama, intensity, humor,incredible action and visual effects, and even a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure, this film has a little something for virtually every possible member of the audience. For the newcomers to the series, the story doesn't require you to have seen, or have any previous knowledge of the other films in the series. The film takes an appropriate amount of time to introduce you to all of the primary players in the film, giving them each their moment or two to shine. So, if you are unfamiliar with these iconic characters you soon won't be, once the incredibly fast-paced two hours of this film are through with you.    Now, don't fret any of you die hard fans out there that may not have seen this film yet, although I doubt there are all that many of you left that this statement could apply to at this point. There are plenty of insider references to previous events or famous quotes from your favorite characters for you to latch onto. Even though this film was made in a way that it could appeal to a much broader spectrum of the audience, it never faltered from supplying the core fan base with plenty of sci-fi goodness for them to embrace along the way. So, make no mistake, this entry into the ever-expanding Star Trek universe is a film that is completely deserving of carrying on the legacy of this epic series, and it never once loses sight of that responsibility.    Speaking of responsibility to the series' legacy, keeping these iconic characters alive is an all-new bunch of actors chosen to embody them in their younger years. This is no small feat when considering these roles were made famous many years ago by a talented and beloved cast of actors and actresses. Winning over the hearts and minds of new fans of the series shouldn't be all that hard for this cast; however, proving to the longtime fans of the franchise, some dating all the way back to the original series, may prove much harder to accomplish.    Leading the cast are two talented actors, Chris Pine(\\"Smokin' Aces\\") and Zachary Quinto (TV's \\"Heroes\\"), portraying the coveted roles of Kirk and Spock respectively. Chris Pine brings a normal speech pattern to Kirk, opting not to emulate William Shatner's pause-ridden pattern of speech; however, Chris did retain Kirk's sense of humor, arrogance, and no-quit attitude. His performance provides audiences with a new interpretation to the character while remaining true to the heart and soul of Kirk. For Zachary Quinto his portrayal of Spock was partially achieved before he ever read a single line of dialogue because he bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Leonard Nimoy (who had portrayed the character in the previous incarnation). Out of the entire ensemble cast, Quinto is probably the brightest spot in the group, as his performance is absolutely perfect for the character. Even though his performance so closely resembles that of his predecessor's, he never once ventures into the realm of imitation as so many other actors may have been tempted to do.    Supporting the two leads, is quite the gifted ensemble of actors and actresses ranging from Simon Pegg (\\"Hot Fuzz\\"), Karl Urban (\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\"), John Cho (Harold from the `Harold and Kumar' films), Zoe Saldana (\\"Vantage Point\\"), and Anton Yelchin (\\"Teminator: Salvation\\"). Simon Pegg brings a much more hilarious approach to the brilliant engineer known as Montgomery Scott, best known as Scotty, that some may find distracting due to his character being more stoic in previous appearances. However, since this film takes place at a time in the character's life that hasn't been explored, I for one view this as an acceptable revision. Karl Urban, much like Zachary Quinto, gives an almost pitch-perfect portrayal of Dr. McCoy. I found it interesting to see that as brilliant a doctor as McCoy was in the previous films, we get to see a slightly inexperienced version of him here, while he's still incredibly smart, he does make mistakes and isn't nearly as sure of his decisions as he is later on. John Cho and Zoe Saldana don't really get to break all that much new ground with their characters, Sulu and Uhura, yet the two young talents do get a few moments to shine within the film. Most notably for fans of the original series, the various hints to Sulu's sword fighting abilities are finally showcased allowing a new, more action-oriented side of the character to emerge. The only slight problem that I have with the casting is that perhaps Anton Yelchin was slightly mis-cast as Pavel Chekov. While he brings the character's trademark substitution of w's for v's out in almost every line of dialogue he has, he doesn't strike me as a good fit for the character. Even with that complaint, Anton did do a good job as Chekov; I just don't see him ever becoming the man we all know.    Rounding out the cast is veteran character actor Bruce Greenwood (\\"I, Robot\\") and Eric Bana (\\"Hulk\\"). Bruce Greenwood portrays the original captain of this starship Enterprise named Christopher Pike. He's a seasoned veteran of Starfleet, who expects nothing but excellence from all who serve under his command. Greenwood's portrayal of Pike reminds me of Captain Kirk in the previous films, where he was much more reserved and in control of every situation, never willing to sacrifice others for a mission that he wasn't willing to undertake himself. As for Eric Bana who plays the vengeful Romulan known as Nero, he wasn't given a whole lot to do with the character other than appear menacing and bark orders. There were a few flashes of character development for him, but nothing so substantial as to make him appear any more or less dangerous than any other villain you would find in a `Star Trek' movie. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't make any mention of his presence in the film; Leonard Nimoy reprises his role of Spock once again. Surprisingly, Nimoy's appearance in the film isn't relegated to being a bit of stunt casting for a glorified cameo; instead, the presence ofthe much older Spock is integral to the movie's central plotline and provides some very fun moments within the film.    Over 40 years since the original series first introduced us to this enduring franchise, and despite a few rough patches of waning popularity over the last several years, J.J. Abrams' \\"Star Trek\\" restores the series to its former magnificence. With a great story, a terrific cast, and visual effects that are nothing short of incredible, \\"Star Trek\\" has become my new favorite entry into this series, removing \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" from the coveted position.    \\"Star Trek\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.

B0016A2FFG|4.0|It's a bit amusing to read that this is a \\"comeback\\" for Al Green, as if his past few secular albums have not existed. This is a solid album, reflective of some of Green's best early career work. It is much better than the CD which preceded it, I Can't Stop, but it is not as good as his best album, 1995's Your Heart's In Good Hands. I can live without the guest artists, but at least they don't detract from Al's artistry.
B001TWT0A4|5.0|In 1966, popular director Harold Hawks (1932's \\"Scarface\\", 1938's \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" and 1940's \\"His Girl Friday\\") known for directing popular romantic comedies back in the 1930's and 1940's returned with his second western titled \\"El Dorado\\".<br /><br />Although Hawks was not a specialist in the Western genre, his film \\"Rio Hondo\\" was critically acclaimed and so, when he created his second Western \\"EL DORADO\\" (as part of his Western trilogy) eventually, his second film would be known for the unique pairing of western greats John Wayne and Robert Mitchum.  Two stars that would guarantee \\"EL DORADO\\" to become a box office hit.<br /><br />The film also would feature actor James Caan, Ed Asner, Arthur Hunnicutt and actresses Charlene Holt and Michele Carey.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />If there is one thing to say about the Paramount \\"CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" releases, many of these classic films have all been digitally remastered and look absolutely magnificent.  These films containing the \\"CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" moniker are the definitive versions to own as they tend to have more features added and overall, like how CRITERION COLLECTIONS have spotlighted on films worldwide and have given top treatment, Paramount has done the same with several of their classic films.  With that being said, I can only wish that a Blu-ray high definition transfer is in the works for these classic films because if they have been through a process of remastering, one can only expect how phenomenal these will look via HD.<br /><br />For now, \\"EL DORADO - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" is only available via DVD but this new version is remastered, in widescreen and features Dolby Digital audio.<br /><br />The picture quality for a DVD is actually quite clean for a film nearly 40-years-old.  The film utilizes a good number of outdoor shots and video looks quite clean for an older film.<br /><br />For audio, I tested the audio on my receiver set at \\"Dolby Digital Mono\\".  What can I say....the gunshots really come alive in the sound department.  Granted, the film is primarily dialogue-based but I realized how pronounced those gun and rifle shots sound on my home theater system.<br /><br />Overall, \\"EL DORADO\\" has been given special treatment and fans of the film will not be disappointed.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"EL DORADO - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" comes with two discs.  Here is what to expect on both discs:<br /><br />DISC 1: The first disc includes the original film but also contains two commentary tracks.<br /><br />  * Commentary by Filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich - Peter Bogdanovich (\\"The Last Picture Show\\") was good friends with Director Howard Hawks and for this commentary, Bogdanovich who is very familiar with westerns, talks about the people on the set and any tidbits of the film which Howard Hawks have told him.<br />  * Commentary by Critic and Film Historian Richard Schikel, actor Ed Asner and Author Todd McCarthy. - The men talk about Harold Hawks, the talent and their overall thoughts about the film.<br /><br />DISC 2: This second disc contains the special features<br /><br />  * Ride, Boldly Ride: The Journey to El Dorado 7-Part Featurette - (total run time: 41:50) This special feature is quite lengthy and focuses on Howard Hawks, the talents of \\"El Dorado\\" and much more.  The documentary is broken up into seven parts:<br /><br />- CHAPTER 1: THE PARADIGM OF AN ENTERTAINER - (5:32) A featurette discussing how unique Howard Hawks was.  How he has had a constant run of smash hits durin ghte 30's and 40's and has an adversarial role with the movie studios.<br /><br />- CHAPTER 2: STEALING FROM HIMSELF - (5:18) This chapter talks about how \\"EL DORADO\\" was somewhat a remake of \\"RIO HONDO\\".  How \\"EL DORADO\\" Borrowed heavily, the Western elements of \\"RIO HONDO\\".<br /><br />- CHAPTER 3: A TACITURN MAN - (4:15) People who knew Howard Hawks, his friends talked about how he was taciturn and self-contained.<br /><br />- CHAPTER 4: PROFESSIONALCOURTESY - (11:39) This film features interviews about Howard Hawks, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum and those who worked with the men.<br /><br />- CHAPTER 5: SPOTLIGHT - JAMES CAAN - (5:02) James Caan worked previously on a Howard Hawks film titled \\"Red Line 7000' and was later casted for a Western with John Wayne.  Interview with James Caan and<br /><br />- CHAPTER 6: THE DUKE, THE GREY FOX AND PAPPY - (6:58) Howard Hawks and John Wayne working together.  Also, Howard Hawks having to say goodbye to John Ford.<br /><br />- CHAPTER 7: AN OLD-AGE MASTERPIECE - (3:37) How \\"El Dorado\\" was filmed in 1965 and came out in 1967 and the challenges of media behind-the-scenes.<br /><br />  * The Artist and the American West (1967) - Vintage Featurette - (5:28) a classic (and very aged) featurette about the American West and also some commentary on the film \\"EL DORADO\\".<br />  * Behind the Gates: A.C. Lyles Remembers John Wayne - (5:32) A.C. Lyles (a movie producer for Paramount, especially the Westerns that were in theaters during the 1950's and 1960's) talks about his friend John Wayne and offers us behind-the-scenes of a variety of films that the Duke has worked on.  From the winning of his award to his earlier and later career.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - (3:05) The original 1996 theatrical trailer.<br />  * Galleries: These photo galleries contain Lobby Cards and Production<br /><br />Included with the set is an 8-page guide about the talent in the film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"EL DORADO\\" is rather a fun, action film that knows when to balance its seriousness with its humor.  On one side of the spectrum, you get movie greats John Wayne and Robert Mitchum together.  But on the other side, it's about character development which \\"EL DORADO\\" is very much strong in showcasing.<br /><br />The film features two legendary actors in their own right but then you start adding more talent such as James Caan as Mississippi, a character that brings the comedic element to the film.  And then you have two beautiful women, Charlene Holt (Maudie) and Michele Carey (Joey MacDonald) who are women that are not weak, in fact they are independent thinkers who do things on their own. Considering that women were not exactly featured in equal footing,  to see these women as strong and independent, this was quite rare in a film created at that time, especially for a Western.<br /><br />Overall, \\"EL DORADO\\" was an entertaining, humorous but really enjoyable Western.  I absolutely enjoyed the scene as Cole and Mississippi make a concoction to help the sheriff sober up and then you have scenes where Mississippi goes to check on a shooter that is hiding near the sheriff's station (which turns out to be Joey) and he tries to apprehend her.  And of course, the natural banter between Wayne and Mitchum that seem natural and real.<br /><br />This is the first Western release for the \\"CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" and is #9 in the series.  The DVD actually provides some interesting tidbits as Director Peter Bogdanovich who was good friends with Hawk, was at the set during the filming and is able to give his personal insight about Hawks and the various talent for the film.  So, Western fans will definitely find some enjoyment with what is included on the two discs. There is a good number of special features that will definitely keep the viewer busy for a few hours.<br /><br />Overall, \\"EL DORADO\\" is an enjoyable Western.  Definitely not as superb as \\"RIO HONDO\\" but because the film manages to effectively use the talents of John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, James Caan and Charlene Holt effectively, made this film quite appealing.  If you are a John Wayne or Robert Mitchum fan or even a fan of this classic 1966 film, definitely check out \\"EL DORADO - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\".  This is the definitive version to own on DVD!APTER 5: SPOTLIGHT - JAMES CAAN - (5:02) James Caan worked previously on a Howard Hawks film titled \\"Red Line 7000 and was later casted for a Western with John Wayne.

A boy seeking out the girl of his dreams is killed by his dream.  violence is the god of this movie, and to see friends kill each other is the libation for this new religion.  This is definately not a movie to be missed.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|\\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" is considered one of the greatest Westerns of all time.  Directed by longtime and legendary Western director John Ford, the film would bring together two of Hollywood's top film stars James Stewart and John Wayne.<br /><br />Paramount has chosen for its latest \\"CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" releases to feature two westerns.  #8 \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" and #9 \\"EL DORADO\\". Both films featuring John Wayne and paired with a top actor but showing two directors known for their Westerns, John Ford and Harold Hawks.<br /><br />\\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" would become one of the last Western films to be shot in B&W and in Dec. 2007, the film was selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry as part of the few films deemed as \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\\".<br /><br />\\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" is a film that features a well-written screenplay but most of all John Ford's experience of getting the best of his talent for this film.  What happens in the final 15-minutes of the film is amazing and when you get to the final moments of the film, you literally are left in awe.  Overall, a magnificent film!<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" get the \\"CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" treatment from Paramount and that means the film gets the digitally remastered treatment.  The picture quality on DVD is absolutely magnificent and video is presented in Widescreen (enhanced for 16:9  TV's).  The black and white picture seems to look clean without any imperfections and like many \\"CENTENNIAL COLLECTIONS\\", the film definitely received fabulous treatment as blacks are nice and deep and for a 1966 film, no sign of that \\"aged\\" look of older films.<br /><br />Audio is presented in Dolby Digital: English 5.1 Surround and English and Spanish Mono.  The film is primarily a dialogue-driven film and aside from a few gunshots and a little action in the beginning and near the end of the film, this film is front and center channel driven.  But dialogue is crystal clear.<br /><br />With that being said, \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" looks and sounds great due to the digitally remastered treatment it received.  Because it has been restored, I can only hope for a High Definition 1080p treatment on Blu-ray because if Paramount went this far in making this film look so good (and include all these new features), a cinema fan can only wish for this classic to get the HD treatment (as of all the CENTENNIAL COLLECTION releases).<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" is strong on features and informative interviews from John Bogdanovich's audio recordings with John Ford, James Stewart and Lee Marvin.<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />  * Commentary by Filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich, along with his archival recordings with John Ford and James Stewart - John Bogdanovich always has informative director commentary for his films but he also has a lot to say about Westerns since he had done interviews with John Ford and the talent (note: Bogdanovich offers commentary also on the Vol. 9 \\"EL DORADO - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\").  Bogdanovich has a lot of knowledge about the film and during the commentary, he would have his audio interviews with Ford and Stewart playing during the commentary.<br />  * Selected Scene Commentary by Dan Ford, along with his archival recordings with John Ford, James Stewart and Lee Marvin - The following scenes below have commentary that focuses on the experiences of Director John Ford but also James Stewart and Lee Marvin working on a John Ford film.  The commentary is not about a certain scene but mostly experiences.<br /><br />- Stagecoach Holdup<br />- Bringing Injured Ransom Back to Town<br />- Showdown at Peter's Place<br />- Town Meeting<br />- Ransom Shoots Liberty<br />- Who Really Shot Liberty Valance<br />- Leaving Shinbone<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />* The Size of Legends, The Soul of Myth: 7 -Part Featurette - (50:52)  An informative featurette about \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" broken down to seven parts.  Interviews with John Ford's son Dan Ford, Peter Bogdanovich (include audio from his interviews with John Ford, James Stewart and Lee Marvin), interviews with critics, former Paramount execs and more.  Here is what to expect from this featurette:<br /><br />- CHAPTER 1: CHANGING OF THE GUARD - (2:53) The change that was happening during the time with the late 60's and civil unrest.  Hollywood was changing and people who worked in the silent era and the contract system was now ending.  Television was taking away audiences and it was a blow to the industry.  So, the directors and talent had to adjust to the new Hollywood.<br /><br />- CHAPTER 2: THE IRASCIBLE POET - (4:41) \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" was based on Dorothy M. Johnson's short story but John Ford executed things differently.  In the book,  Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) nudging and coaching Stoddard but in the film, Donophan's character is less proactive in helping Stoddard's character.  How John Wayne's had a ten picture deal with Paramount and John Ford trying to get the financing for the film.<br /><br />- CHAPTER 3: THE HERO DOESN'T WIN, THE WINNER ISN'T HEROIC - (10:39) \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" was John Ford's last great film.  How it was different from past Ford films.  How a lot of the film was shot at MGM and how Ford's shots were economical.  Why John Ford wanted to shoot in black and white.  Focusing on the filmmaking and the characters of the film.<br /><br />- CHAPTER 4: MOST THINGS HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT - (13:52) How Director John Ford would say the good things on screen would happen by accident.  How John Wayne was fascinating to watch.  And behind-the-scenes on how Ford dealt with people on set with interviews with Lee Marvin by Dan Ford (recorded in 1970).  Also, how John Ford will pick on some of his actors and the biggest story that came from \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" and with three days left, how John Wayne said to Jimmy Stewart how he never been under the barrel (picked on by Ford) but it was until Jimmy Stewart made a dumb, racist comment in regards to the outfit of Woody Strode (Pompey), that is when Ford got the whole film crew together and admonished Stewart in front of everyone for his comment.  The actual audio interview from 1965 between John Bogdanovich and Jimmy Stewart about this incident is featured.  The two respected each other despite the admonishing by Ford.  Also, discussion about Vera Miles and how important she was to the film.<br /><br />- CHAPTER 5: THE GREAT PROTECTOR - (5:17) Interview with Peter Bogdanovich of how there was no way to prepare an interview with John Ford.  Featuring an interview in 1966 when John Ford doesn't like the questions from Peter Bogdanovich.  Also, an interesting behind-the-scenes who John Ford, Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin and Woody Strode were military veterans and how John Ford would beat up on John Wayne because he could take it but more because these actors fought in wars while John Wayne got credit as a film actor.  Reflecting on why John Wayne would let John Ford treat him this way but the respect John Wayne had for Ford.<br /><br />- CHAPTER 6: SPOTLIGHT - LEE MARVIN - (8:02) How Lee Marvin and John Wayne worked together in one film and how John Wayne recommended him to John Ford.  How Lee Marvin was excited to be part of a John Ford film.  How Ford respected him because of his military experience. Audio interview from 1970 by Dan Ford with Lee Marvin about working with John Ford.  A featurette celebrating the career of Lee Marvin.<br /><br />- CHAPTER 7: PRINT THE LEGEND - (5:59) \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" did not receive critical appreciation  when it was released in theaters back in 1962 and thought about as passe and a tired Western.  Bogdanovich talks abouthow he went to a screening and only four people showed up but over the years, it received critical support worldwide.  Europeans appreciated John Ford and John Wayne films and eventually Americans started to appreciate the film around the mid-to-late 70's and became known as the last great Western by John Ford.<br /><br />* Original Theatrical Trailer - (2:44) The original black and white theatrical trailer.<br />* Galleries: - This still photo gallery features Lobby Cards, Production photos, John Ford photos and Publicity photos.<br /><br />Included with \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" is a short booklet with information on the film, providing a few tidbits of the talent, Director John Ford and more.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" is truly an awesome John Ford film unlike many Westerns that focused on the gun battles and outlaw exchange.  Although, \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" does include some elements of the standard Western but in a way, it's more of a tragedy.  Saying anything more than beyond that would spoil the film.<br /><br />But with such a strong screenplay under the directing of John Ford, you get powerful performances from John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin and Vera Miles.  Actually, there are a bunch of other talents with their own characters who also shine in this film that stick in your mind and how these characters contributed to making the town of Shinbone come alive.<br /><br />I am absolutely delighted with Paramount giving this film the \\"CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" treatment.  Not only do you get the film digitally remastered, the picture quality and the audio quality is very well done.  Again, because it has been remastered with all new special features, one can hope this day and age to see such a film get the High Definition treatment on Blu-ray.<br /><br />For those who are just becoming cinema fans and want to enjoy a Western and have never seen a John Wayne film, these two \\"CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" releases (vol. 9 - \\"EL DORADO\\") are just amazing.  Paramount gives us two distinct styles of Western films from both legendary directors John Ford and the other with Harold Hawks and hopefully, will usher in a new generation of movie fans who can appreciate these classic Westerns.<br /><br />There is nothing bad that can be said about this release.  Paramount continues to give cinema fans definitive versions of these classic films through the \\"CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" and I just have to point out that for so long, especially with situations that have happened behind-the-scenes of \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\", we only learn about these situations from what we have read.<br /><br />It's absolutely wonderful that Peter Bogdanovich and Dan Ford has shared a lot of their audio recordings through the commentary and special features because with many of these great talent no longer with us, it was definitely special to have Jimmy Stewart and Lee Marvin and even John Ford discuss their experiences several years after the film was released in theaters.  There have been a few books and publications that have featured the story of Jimmy Stewart's comment about Woody Strode's outfit and what John Ford had to say afterward.  But it's very good to hear it come from Jimmy Stewart's mouth and hear his tone that he knew he said something dumb and regretted it.<br /><br />The 7-part featurette \\"The Size of Legends, The Soul of Myth\\" is absolute magnificent and an amazing tribute to Ford's last great Western.  But also a tribute to the talent who were involved in the film.  So, very informative and enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />I absolutely enjoyed this release and I really enjoyed the film.  I watched it once and watched it again the following day with the various commentary and I'll be the first to tell you that I have not watched many John Wayne films, nor have I watched many John Ford films but after watching \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\", it gave me an appreciation for the Western film genre and makes me want to go back and watch other classic Western films featuring the collaboration between the two.  \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" is absolutely wonderful!<br /><br />Overall, \\"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" is highly recommended!Americans started to appreciate the film around the mid-to-late 70's and became known as the last great Western by John Ford.    * Original Theatrical Trailer - (2:44) The original black and white theatrical trailer.  * Galleries: - This still photo gallery features Lobby Cards, Production photos, John Ford photos and Publicity photos.

There is a two disc version which includes a digital copy file on the second disc.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"TAKEN\\" is featured in Widescreen (aspect ration of 2:40:01) and where many films tend to show the beauty of France, Director Pierre Morel wanted to show the real France, which include the seedy areas where prostitution and European gangs are located.  So, you get the gritty side of France and overall, picture quality is pretty good.  Granted, this is on DVD but I can imagine that on Blu-ray, this film's transfer would be wonderful with the amount of detail, outdoor scenes and action scenes involved.<br /><br />As for the audio, audio is featured in English 5.1 Dolby Digital  (Spanish and French audio tracks in Dolby Surround are included).  This film sports a lot of action scenes.  From a car chase, many gun and machine gun shots, a pop concert and crowds galore, this  film utilized all 5.1 channels.  I was very impressed that I can only imagine how much immersive the Blu-ray DTS-HD Master Audio would be. Overall, the DVD's audio is well done at Dolby Digital 5.1.  I also watched the film in French and was very impressed by the quality of the voice acting!  Well done!<br /><br />Subtitles for \\"TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT\\" feature English, French and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT\\" features the following special features:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary by Director Pierre Morel, Cinematographer Michel Abramowicz and Michel Julienne (Unrated Version Only) - The commentary is featured in French with English subtitles.  How they were impressed by Liam Neeson's performance, how complex the construction scene/chase scene was to do and how certain scenes were shot and information on scenes with explosions.<br />  * Audio Commentary by Writer Robert Mark Kamen (Unrated Version Only) - Robert Mark Kamen talks about his 15-year writing partnership with Luc Besson and how they work together.  His impression of the film going from a R rating to a PG-13 rating and also his thoughts on the film and the people cast.<br />  * Le \\"Making Of\\" featurette - (18:20) Interviews with Director Pierre Morel, the cast of \\"TAKEN\\" and how it was like working on the film, filming in Paris, working with a Director who wants to do the camera work and how Liam Neeson did a lot of his stunts with the exception of the high jumps and more.<br />  * Inside Action: Side by Side Comparisons of - Six scenes featuring the actual film and the perspective from the filmmaker's side which shows the cameras and crew while filming the movie.<br /><br />*Peter Dies<br />*Bryan Escapes Construction Site<br />*Good Luck<br />*The Interrogation<br />*Bryan at Saint Clair's<br />*Boat Fight<br /><br />  * Avant Premiere- (4:36) The premiere of the film in France and interviews with Luc Besson, Director Pierre Morel and Liam Neeson (accompanied with his wife, Natasha Richardson).  The three talking to the press, to the audience and then audience interviews of how they felt about the film.<br />  * Trailers - No trailer for the film but a trailer for \\"NOTORIOUS\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"TAKEN\\" is a magnificent, action-packed film!  It was also interesting to have a action-based International thriller that is not centered around terrorism but a real life problem of human trafficking and kidnappings of young women forced to take part in prostitution and forced into a life of drug addiction.  \\"TAKEN\\" features a perfect blend of action that is not overdone but most importantly, a well-written storyline that complimented the action scenes.  Director Pierre Morel who is very experienced as a camera operator knows what kind of shots he wanted and Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen together again for another well-written action-packed thriller.<br /><br />I also have to say that I was surprised when I first heard that Liam Neeson would be the action-star of this suspense/thriller.  Even listening to the audio commentary, the writer Robert Mark Kamen was surprised but realized that Liam Neeson is a tall and fit actor, and Director Pierre Morel felt Neeson was perfect for the job.  Granted, we have seen Neeson fight before in films like \\"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\" but his performance as a Jack Bauer-style agent who will do whatever it takes to find his daughter was impressive.<br /><br />Personally, I want to see more of Neeson as the character of Brian Mills.  I think there are a lot more storylines that this character can take part in and similar to a film like \\"DIE HARD\\", I really hope the planned sequel is just as action-packed as this first film.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the performance of Maggie Grace.  Having enjoyed her performance in the first and second season of \\"LOST\\", I was surprised to see the popular blonde from the show as a brunette.  But Grace did a wonderful job in playing an older teenager who seemed quite reserved but most of all, hitting her emotional scenes effectively.<br /><br />The special features were quite interesting, especially learning how Director Pierre Morel likes to be behind the camera while he directs but also hearing the enthusiasm by the people involved with the film and the audience in France.  Also, it was very touching to see Liam Neeson together with his wife, the late-Natasha Richardson and how loving the couple were and even having her share the same stage with him during the press photography with both Besson and Morel in France.<br /><br />Overall, \\"TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT\\" is an action-packed film that takes you on one heck of a wild ride.  Well-done job for second time director Pierre Morel, beautiful cinematography by Michel Abramowicz, well-written screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen.<br /><br />Also, wonderful performances by Liam Neeson and the rest of the cast.  But combined with a DVD featuring an immersive and aggressive soundtrack with well-done utilization of all speaker channels, \\"TAKEN\\" is an action thriller worth owning on DVD and having in your collection.  I'm guessing that the film is much more impressive on High Definition for Blu-ray, so if you have a Blu-ray player and want an excellent action film, \\"TAKEN\\" is title worth checking out.<br /><br />In the likes of James Bond, Jason Bourne and even Jack Bauer, I definitely want to see more of Brian Mills!  \\"TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT\\" is highly recommended!Liam Neeson (accompanied with his wife, Natasha Richardson).

0679847367|5.0|Wow, I placed my order and zoom, I received my order right away. Thank you.
B0013FSL0C|2.0|The glowing reviews above reflect wishful and distorted thinking. In my 22 years of therapy -- that's right, 22! -- I've thankfully never encountered a Paul Weston, and would have ditched him if I had. Weston's predictably banal responses to his patients could have been generated by computer. His reckless disregard for the boundaries of his profession are ludicrous at best, and dangerous at worst. Accepting an expensive gift from a patient -- the famous all-the-bells-and-whistles coffeemaker -- cheaply encodes the character's resistance. But it also irrevocably contaminates his therapy. The remaining clients fare as badly at Weston's hands -- for example, in the unchecked violence the couple display in Weston's office. Therapy is meant as a safe space, not as a danger zone. Rather multiply examples, of which there are many, I concede the show's single bright spot: Gina's scrupulous adherence to the canons Weston so flagrantly violates, and Dianne Wiest's brilliant evocation of a therapist who knows her business. This show's problem lies not in its acting, which is fine throughout, but in its overdrawn and needlessly melodramatic scripts. Interestingly, my psychologist agrees. But then, he sets and maintains boundaries. These frustrate the resistant client at times, but ultimately make for successful outcomes. Critical hoopla notwithstanding, the distressing portrayal of \\"treatment\\" makes this series one to avoid.
B000QEIORG|2.0|Foo Fighters are all right, but the overall problem with them is blandness. How do you work with Kurt Cobain and churn out music so boring? Didn't Kurt play Dave any Sonic Youth albums? Not to mention the horrible sound quality.
B0000019PA|5.0|For some, and I include myself in this, reading reviews of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea that approach the album by, for example, breaking down its tracks one at a time, or by placing it in a box that reads \\"Indie Rock\\" is puzzling. It's like listening to someone explain the color of sadness; it doesn't make sense in our world, doesn't make sense to those of us for whom the music and words have become something else.  I mean, yes, the vocals are screechy, and yes, the music is good: good enough at least to make me listen to it until it broke my heart.  But that's not the point.  And I guess there's the cutoff, right there.      For some, the album will never reach them the way it has reached us and for that I actually feel sad for them.  They'll mention the length of \\"Oh Comely\\" or the way Jeff's voice cracks when he sings, \\"Goldaline, my dear\\" as though it could ever have been any different.  They'll talk about catchy guitar strums and beautiful lyrics as if they existed separately.  They'll name-drop zanzithophone and aeolian harp as though these were strange instruments to include on an album.  While for us, the people whom the album has touched, Aeroplane simply is.    I'm trying not to sound condescending, but with all my talk of \\"them\\" and \\"us\\" and with me \\"feeling sad\\" for people I guess it isn't working.  That's not my intent.  The last thing I want to do is put off anyone from listening to this album.  I'm just trying to get across the fact that for many people, whether they love it or loathe it, this album is just one in a collection of similar albums, while for others this album is as far away from Album X as an elephant's painting is from longing.    If you've read other reviews by people who have been touched by this album, you've likely read words like \\"perfect\\" and \\"art\\".  These words, like this review, are just a device people use to try to describe something that has affected them deeply.  These words can make you roll your eyes.  I know.  It's happened to me while reading reviews of other products on Amazon, products I liked.  But let me at least assure you of this: these people are not just showering hyperbole on their latest new favorite toy.  In this case, they mean what they say.  For them, like it is for me, the album is everything they've written and more.    I don't know what else to say really...just give it a chance, a real chance.  You might find it an annoying eccentricity, you might find it catchy little album, or it might drag your emotions from you and throw them across the sky.  Finding out is probably worth $13.99.
B000669GAI|1.0|Wow, the remixer for this album must have some technical prowess. Who else could make one of the most boring bands of the early 90's even more boring? But he figured out a way: by removing all the dynamics from their songs. Now they sound exactly like Creed or Nickelback. Nice job man.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Thought this was a very different and interesting movie. Made interesting by the fact that it is based on actual events.  Good actors and well acted with great human interest story of about Faith.
B001N18HOQ|1.0|I'll never understand why people like Pearl Jam. Maybe they liked them in the 90's because they wanted to be cool and \\"grunge\\" but couldn't handle punk music. Even Nevermind for God's sake which is about as easy as it gets. What's their excuse now?     Pearl Jam is so bland they bored me when I liked Tori Amos and Coldplay and I STILL hate them now that I love bands like Black Sabbath and Sonic Youth. It's garbage. Only bother if you like boring music.
0739367676|5.0|Breaking Dawn was by far the most entertaining book of all the series.  This one brings the whole perspective of Edward and Bella's future into view.  The fact that they are now a family and willing to do whatever it takes to protect the family is overwhelming.  I love Reneesme and was enchanted they way she spoke to everyone.  I liked that all the vampires the Cullen's considered friends were willing to stand with them against the Volturi. Listening to it was better than reading it.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Even though the arena was the nature of the questionable relationship between Fr. Flynn and a child, this film was really more about certainty vs. doubt, hierarchy, social change, perception and the choices that each of us makes to achieve whatever it is that we have set as our goal.  The writers and director obviously know the mind and M.O. of an abuser and the abused as well as the psychological forces that impact the beliefs and behaviors of individuals and community. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep and Amy Adams offered strong and believable performances and did it with style.  Viola Davis had a limited part in terms of time on screen, but powerful in terms of the conflict and struggle that she portrayed.  A haunting movie that does not readily leave the heart and mind ~ one that provokes much thought and food for conversation....
0618918248|5.0|Contrary to how some have viewed his work, Dawkins purposely did not cover some of the worst evils unleashed by religion.  He clearly defined issues and argued, for instance, that it was not the belief or disbelief in a god that drove Stalin and Hitler to commit their crimes.  Toward the end of his book he provided a great example in which it becomes clear that we cannot necessarily look back through history and blame everyone who unknowingly committed an atrocity in the name of religion, but we need not celebrate the system that led to the atrocity.  Dawkins writes much more clearly than I and beautifully links a wealth of literature and culture into every chapter.  He made the point that one need not give up thousands of years of culture simply because one no longer believes the myth of its creation.
B000P12LWY|4.0|I am a fan of historical fiction and this one takes the cake. The actors are sexy and spot-on, though some of the accents have been \\"toned down\\" to fit an American ear, I think. The storyline is mostly true to history, although some characters have been blended, some actions are attributed to another. King Henry was a gregarious man who was in the impossible position of being in charge of a nation while being manipulated by those around him. The desire to trust absolutely when you can trust no one can take a toll on you, and Henry seems to be walking a fine line between fantasy and reality, just as he should! Good representation of the times, excellent costuming, and beautiful shots of the countryside.
0375714839|5.0|Now an award-winning animated film, Marjane Satrapi's part-comic-book/part-memoir is now available in a complete paperback.  This true story chronicles \\"Marji's\\" childhood in revolutionary Iran, her life under the thumb of a new regime, her misadventures in Europe, and her return home.  And through it all, Marji's never the same, but her love for her homeland is unshaken.  She grows in body and mind like everyone else, and yet the reader still marvels at the transformation.  All philosophical interpretation aside, \\"Persepolis\\" proves itself to be a literary contender.<br /><br />This comic is unrated: Violence, Adult Language, Adult Situations.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Ok, so perhaps if you already have the other Zep albums, then you could possibly get by without this one. I have heard other versions of these songs and there's no doubt that anybody with a good ear can tell the difference between another album, vinyl, or mp3 format.     However, for those just new to Led Zeppelin, or who may not have any of their other albums, this collection is definitely worth it, the sound quality still is excellent on these discs. You won't be dissapointed.    It's hard to debate which of their \\"greatest hits\\" should have been featured, seeing how, to me, virtually every single song ever performed by Led Zeppelin has been a hit. So for those of you getting it through iTunes or Amazon MP3s and wanting to explore Led Zeppelin for all they are, I would recommend downloading this album and some addition songs not featured, which are \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", \\"Fool in the Rain\\", \\"Going to California\\", \\"Ten Years Gone\\", \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\", and \\"The Battle of Evermore\\". Enjoy.

B000002UAX|5.0|There are over a 1000 reviews on this album with millions of copies purchased, so let me lay it down for you...    Music great, buy album!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I have seen this movie 2 times and I am showing it to my English class and Global History class this week.  Reading the subtitles makes it an excellent activity for those learning and reading in English.  The Global History lesson about freedom  is made more powerful with the conclusion of this film.
B001SO69IY|5.0|10 years, its been since their first effort \\"Blackout\\" was released and it was a bonafide smash in all rights.<br /><br />Now with Meth and Red's new one \\"Blackout 2\\" available its them doing it all over again.  They bring it back and forth between each song trading lines and dropping lyrics.  That will have you thinking, its about time someone brought it back like this.  They have a few guest artists on the album like Keith Murray (good 2 hear from ya again) among others.<br /><br />But they don't detract from the cd as a whole.  As this is strictly about Method Man and Redman.  Blackout 2 is all that you've been waiting for several years now.  It doesn't get anymore real than this one.  On the fence?  Don't be this worth your money and then some.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|i am a huge Paramore fan i bought the 2nd CD riot and loved it so decided to buy the first CD all we know is falling. i am a fan of this CD just as i was the second one.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Thanks for the DVD! It came as described on the website. I am satisfied with my purchase. I will definitely purchase from this seller again!! Thanks again =)
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|Given the accolades this film received I was very excited to see it.  Without doubt Winslet's performance as Schmitz was flawless, one to remember for her career.  Kross as the younger Michael Berg was equally enthralling.  Fiennes's portrayal of adult Berg was a bit stiff and drole, which despite those being hallmarks of Fiennes' skill--posing no challenges to him, the dry delivery of Berg worked well.  Where this film was not a total success to me was in its storytelling.  The plotholes are many, which apparently detracted from the film's glory for much of its audience.  I can say that I did note as the plot progressed that it takes rather unintuitive leaps, though I did not feel that such omissions completely derailed the film.  In the setting of post-war Germany, Berlin, to be specific, I can expect there to be a stoic presentation of life and relationships.  In that setting abundant and lush expressions of feelings and emotion just don't exist.  However, the audience is left to assume this cultural characteristic is the reason for Berg's distance from his family, for any disjunct between Berg and Schmitz, for Berg's reasons that he keeps his relationship with and knowledge of Schmitz to himself.  The explanations of these significant details are conveyed through facial expressions and slowly paced scenes, which for all their subtlety in imparting meaning serve most to slow the pace of the film.  I felt OK with the assumptions I made for characters' motivations, but I can entirely understand an audience for whom that was not enough explanation.  Despite the lack of new perspectives introduced about the Holocaust or the reconstructionist era of Germany, this film will certainly introduce new concepts of humanity to many, particularly the banality of many who were involved with Nazi efforts.  Overall this film is well done and deserving of praise.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I would not say I'm a fan of musicals, but this episode and CD made me believe. I did not watch Buffy when it originally aired, I got into via HULU, then I had to get the [[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)]].  I would say that \\"Once More, with Feeling\\" is one of, if not, my favorite episode(s).  I can't say enough of how much I loved the episode and this CD.  I listen to is a lot.  On my way to work, to the store, road trips, etc.  It's always readily available to get me in a great mood.    If you're a Buffy fan, you got to get this CD(Even if you're late to the show like I am).
B001R3YRG2|5.0|Finally, a special edition of one of the few really innovative film to come out of a studio in the 90's!  I didn't know about this film's existance until it hit cable in 1993, and I must've watched it over a dozen times back then.  I'm very pleased to have a remastered special edition DVD, even if the special features are a bit sparse for my tastes.<br /><br />Firstly, this is truly the most interesting character Michael Douglas has ever played.  This performance is the acting version of surgery.  It's so percise and delicate, that one wrong decision and the whole thing, the character, the story, the film's tone completely falls apart.  Douglas plays Ben Foster, though throughout the majority of the film he is simply known as D-FENS(the letters on his personalized license plate).  D-FENS is a recently laid off defense worker, end of the cold war hung a lot of the men in this profession out to dry(according to the DVD's loaded commentary track) and he just snaps one day in traffic.  He decides he is going to see his ex-wife and child and he walks across L.A. to get to them.  He walks around parts of L.A. rarely seen on film.  Parts of the city that make up the majority of it, but are glossed or glorified in past films.  On his way 'home' D-FENS runs into common annoyances that are part-and-parcel when existing in a crowded area like a city: gang members, angry Korean store owners, surly fast food clerks, and a red neck running an Army/Navy store.  Oh, and he does something I know I've always dreamed about to a construction site.  This film is rife with blackly humorous satirical jabs and outrage against what America has ultimately become what certain people like D-FENS feel about a changing society that is happy to leave them behind.<br /><br />An audience member fed on a healthy diet of recent films coming to this movie cold will be shocked about the un-P.C. nature of the story.  Filmed in 1992, I guess moviegoers were a lot less sensitive and could think more for themselves.  This film would never get made today by a studio, NEVER.  Douglas doesn't make excuses for his character's behavior in the film.  There's no cheesy or false moments of realizations.  He starts on a dark path and goes all the way through to the end without common movie conventions hindering the tone or reality of the story.  That's why his performance is so brilliant.  He plays a narrow minded dinosaur of a man, who acts out the worst possible aspects of a repressed outrage, but he manages to get some sympathy, and even some slight semblance of understanding from the audience.  He acts out certain blue collar fantasies.  He shows how awful they really are when being applied to reality, but never sugar coats it.  He seems real in an unreal situation. The only contrived thing about the film is the aspect of how the Douglas character manages to make it across L.A. unnoticed and without being caught within what amounts to an 8 or 10 hour day.<br /><br />Robert Duvall plays that age-old cinema convention of the about-to-retire cop who has elected to ride a desk job for the latter part of his career.  The weird thing is,this film makes the cop convention seem fresh, in no small degree due to Duvall's very real and welcoming performance.  It just proves that just because it's a cliche' doesn't mean it can't be original or entertaining.  He has the same blue collar life as D-FENS but he chooses a different path.  The movie alludes that his obsession with apprehending D-FENS comes from how much he relates to his plight.  In the film's climax you can sense in Duvall's performance the he doesn't want the situation to end badly.  It's a more subtle performance, but it's just as brilliant as Douglas'.<br /><br />The DVD itself only has two special features, a commentary track and a new interview with Michael Douglas.  I was bummed that there wasn't a retrospective doc concerning the film, but that was until I listend to the commentary track. The track has comments from director Joel Schumacher, the producers, Douglas, screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith, and even Vonde Curtis Hall(who has about a minute of screen time in the film as the 'Not Economically Viable' protester outside a bank). This extra mile is why this commentary track goes above and beyond the usual and negates the necessity of a retrospective doc. The interview with Michael Douglas is really interesting.  He gives details on how at the Falling Down point in his career he was in a slump, tired of playing reactive characters in such films as Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct.  He also thinks back to the period and the changes the country was going through politically and socially.  One of the main reasons this film even ended up studio produced was becaus Douglas(also a producer on the film) lobbied for it and its screenplay so hard.  Not something many actors would do.  A very interesting detail is in regard to how up until that point in his career he picked film projects more based on his producer's hat then his actor hat.  He went for what would make the best movie and not necessarily the best character for him to play.  Douglas is also on the commentary track and he doesn't repeat any of the info contained in the interview.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher is a very interesting director.  He has worked in almost every genre and succeded at most of them.  Most may know and love him from his film The Lost Boys and others may know and hate him from Batman Forever And Batman and Robin.  Please, fanboys, get over it.  Batman and Robin happened over ten years ago.  He's made many fine films since then(Tigerland, Phone Booth, Veronica Guerrin, Phantom of the Opera).  The new Batman franchise is awesome, you got your Batman back to make love to, so please get off the guy's nuts already.  If you actually think Batman And Robin is the worst film ever made then you don't watch many films, at least ones of substance.  Schumacher has always been a filmmaker who directs in darkness(which is strange that they picked him to 'lighten up' the original Batman franchise) and that's why he was perfect for this film.  He lets the narrative and satire play out without haveing scenes or characters come out to let the idiot audience know that 'this was bad' or 'you shouldn't do that'.  He leaves the judgements to the audience.  He also leaves the joys of D-FENS acting out.  Of course, D-FENS enjoyment is cut short in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />After rewatching this film recently I was shocked at how much more relevant the subject matter is today.  The film is about a man left behind in a changing country.  He refuses to catch up and instead chooses to act out.  Here we are in 2009, after the Obama election, and we still have some old white dinosaurs refusing to listen to the majority of the American public and continue to spout the same old-world/1950's empy rhetoric.  It wouldn't surprise me if either Dick Cheney or Rush Limbaugh pulled a D-FENS on the freeway somewhere any day.<br /><br />See this movie and listen to the commentary track immediately.  A great film about choices made, good or bad.producers, Douglas, screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith, and even Vonde Curtis Hall(who has about a minute of screen time in the film as the 'Not Economically Viable' protester outside a bank). This extra mile is why this commentary track goes above and beyond the usual and negates the necessity of a retrospective doc. The interview with Michael Douglas is really interesting.  He gives details on how at the Falling Down point in his career he was in a slump, tired of playing reactive characters in such films as Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct.  He also thinks back to the period and the changes the country was going through politically and socially.  One of the main reasons this film even ended up studio produced was becaus Douglas(also a producer on the film) lobbied for it and its screenplay so hard.  Not something many actors would do.  A very interesting detail is in regard to how up until that point in his career he picked film projects more based on his producer's hat then his actor hat.  He went for what would make the best movie and not necessarily the best character for him to play.  Douglas is also on the commentary track and he doesn't repeat any of the info contained in the interview.    Joel Schumacher is a very interesting director.  He has worked in almost every genre and succeded at most of them.  Most may know and love him from his film The Lost Boys and others may know and hate him from Batman Forever And Batman and Robin.  Please, fanboys, get over it.  Batman and Robin happened over ten years ago.  He's made many fine films since then(Tigerland, Phone Booth, Veronica Guerrin, Phantom of the Opera).  The new Batman franchise is awesome, you got your Batman back to make love to, so please get off the guy's nuts already.  If you actually think Batman And Robin is the worst film ever made then you don't watch many films, at least ones of substance.  Schumacher has always been a filmmaker who directs in darkness(which is strange that they picked him to 'lighten up' the original Batman franchise) and that's why he was perfect for this film.  He lets the narrative and satire play out without haveing scenes or characters come out to let the idiot audience know that 'this was bad' or 'you shouldn't do that'.  He leaves the judgements to the audience.  He also leaves the joys of D-FENS acting out.  Of course, D-FENS enjoyment is cut short in the grand scheme of things.    After rewatching this film recently I was shocked at how much more relevant the subject matter is today.  The film is about a man left behind in a changing country.  He refuses to catch up and instead chooses to act out.  Here we are in 2009, after the Obama election, and we still have some old white dinosaurs refusing to listen to the majority of the American public and continue to spout the same old-world/1950's empy rhetoric.  It wouldn't surprise me if either Dick Cheney or Rush Limbaugh pulled a D-FENS on the freeway somewhere any day.    See this movie and listen to the commentary track immediately.  A great film about choices made, good or bad.
B001TH16DI|5.0|the movies are great i watch them on my PS3 and they are amazing you look at their faces and you would think it was filmed in blu-ray good job paramount and thanks
B0000DZ3HM|5.0|Fantastic musical array of virtuoso's performing memorable compositions and classic riffs. It is a gem. It is something I want everyone I know to have.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|What can I say?  This is simply one of the BEST (if not THE best) series I have ever had the privilege to watch (I've probably seen it 75 times).  It is said that a fine piece of art can be looked at over and over, and still you see things you never noticed before.  The story and the depth of the characters, their relationships, are extraordinary.  The acting is awesome--the characters seem so real.  The production and sets have been painstakingly created to live true to the time period.  This movie is a joy to watch--I have so many movies that I have paid upwards of $25 for  that just sit on my shelf and I never look at a second time. This is a a gift that keeps on giving!<br /><br />I owned the non-Blu Ray version as well as the VHS version.  The single, very frustrating problem with the standard DVD is that the DVD transfer quality was horrendous!  Color stauration and clarity were 4th rate.  Good thing the story and production were awesome, so you could almost overlook that.  When I heard that the movie was being re-transferred to Blu-ray, I pre-ordered it 6 months in advance!  The new Blu-ray version  completely lived up to my expectation (I have a dedicated home theater witha 100\\" 1080p Sony projector, so I can really discern video quality). This is a 1000% improvement--colors are saturated, image sharp.  While it's not quite up to some of today's eye popping 1080p disks, the overall quality is now first class and unquenstionably worth owning.<br /><br />If you have ANY appreciation for a wonderful story, suberp acting, great screenplay, and fine art, you MUST have this one!
B001FB4W0W|1.0|I don't know if it's because I can't stand Anna Paquin or what -- but she's a horrible Sookie.  I think all the actors and charactors are excellently portrayed and they are alot like the book charactors.  However, \\"Sookie\\" sucks....Sookie in the books is strong, funny and covers herself when she's uncomfortable (always has a smile to cover up for being uncomfortable).  The movie Sookie is unreadable, cold and makes herself seems like a \\"dumb blond\\"....not to mention she walks around with this look on her face that's somewhere in between worried and constipated.   I think they should of chose someone else to portrait Sookie..Anna Paquin doesn't cut it.  Didn't like her acting on Xmen and definately don't like it on TrueBlood. It's a shame because the show itself is funny, suspensful and alot like the book which is very uncommon when it comes to movies made from books.  I really tried to make it through the 1st 5 episodes because the show itself was great...but I finally had enough of the Sookie charactor..I had to shut it off.  I'm looking forward to the next book coming out in October though!

B0000DIJO2|5.0|I had forgotten all about the Bee Gees when I happened across the HBO Special and tuned in for a little while, I have waited 10 years to own this on DVD so I could, stop, FF, repeat, or just enjoy every minute of their show. And the DVD has extra songs not seen on the HBO show. I played my taped recording of this show so many times, my husband new the words to every song and what song was playing next. Now I watch it as I walk quickly on my treadmill but every other song or two I have to stop so I can hear every note and pretend I was at the MGM Grand that night. The Brothers Gibb can be watched with the sound off and the charm still comes thru loud and clear. Turn up the volume and you are young and \\"dancing, as you should be, Yah\\"   I definitely like this One Night Only Event, can you tell?
0061339202|3.0|I would classify this book as a notch above the typical pop psychology/self-help/Dr. Phil type of books that proliferate the market. The author does attempt to add some scientific research to support his claim. He does interview a variety of people and their vignettes are interesting to hear. The audio book was only two CDs long, so was a quick and enjoyable listen.    But overall I found the message a bit disjointed. Part of the book talks about how happiness can be achieved from setting and achieving small goals. But then the other part of the book tries to connect that with being in the zone, as athletes and musicians are when performing their craft. I think these are two separate concepts and cannot be explained by a simple philosophy.
B000002UC5|4.0|I first heard McCARTNEY upon its release in 1970. At that time, I was only nine years old, but already I was a Beatles buff and would have bought anything with their name attached to it.<br /><br />Part of my current impression on this LP probably comes from that naive 9-year-old, but I still like it. When McCARTNEY was first released, the facts that the LP had \\"bad blood\\" (McCartney wanted to release it at the same time as The Beatles' finale LET IT BE, which John Lennon feared would kill sales of both albums), and that it was a far more modest affair than expected from the ambitious McCartney, let down a lost of listeners. But my being very young and not filled with lofty expectations probably helped me to enjoy it a lot more.<br /><br />Its surprises are modest but nevertheless apparent. As a kid, I thought \\"Momma Miss America\\" was the coolest song on Earth, and I still think it's among the album's nifty instrumentals, which also include \\"Singalong Junk\\" and \\"Valentine Day.\\" Some of the vocal songs, such as \\"Teddy Boy\\" and \\"Oo You,\\" are a little light on the lyrics, but McCartney's skilled performing (he does all instruments on the album, including piano and drums) still carry them off. The highlights of the albums are \\"Every Night\\" and the song that everyone remembers, the superb \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" -- which, amazingly, wasn't released as a single until McCartney's band Wings did a live version in 1977.<br /><br />McCARTNEY isn't McCartney's greatest achievement, but he did far worse music in the early 1970's (Try to endure WILD LIFE some time). Like even McCartney's lesser work, it has the kind of melodies that stick in your head whether you want them to or not.
0143038419|2.0|I was given this book for Christmas by my sister and read it while on holiday.   The best thing I can say is that it is reasonably well written. However I found the spirituality completely lacking. I can find no sympathy for someone, who instead of admitting to her husband that she does not want the child they'd apparently agreed to try for, runs off to have an affair with a younger man. Is then depressed and suicidal over the rigors of her subsequent divorce and breakup with the unfortunate other man.   She then lands an advance for a book about her proposed recovery travel tour. As other Amazon reviewers have said there is a marked lack of feeling for anyone other than herself. She does not seem to be touched by the poverty endemic in places like India, Bali and to a lesser extent Rome. Her decription of people are only as they pertain directly to her. She shows no interest in their hope or feelings. This includes the woman in Bali she \\"helped\\" to buy a place to live, there is no real empathy for her.  It is illustrative that she ends up with an older man who already has grown children and a vascetomy. No chance of a baby there! I have to say that I think this is a plus - no child deserves such a mother.  It is a memoir of a self-indulgent year spent by a woman who is unable to grow up and face the fundamental reality of the unfairness of life. Something that we all deal with on a day to day basis.

B0011N1WE8|5.0|Poor Penelope is cursed. Not only was she born with the face of a pig but she also must suffer through a seemingly endless parade of prospective suitors who flee in fear at the very sight of her. Of course, according to the legend, she supposedly needs a \\"worthy\\" groom to stick around long enough to break the curse but that is beginning to seem rather hopeless.<br /><br />What I liked...<br />-Being that Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairy tales the storyline really caught my attention. Penelope is an enjoyable re-telling of a classic story with some cute plot twists.<br />-The setting is quirky with retro and modern elements. I found the sets and locations to be charming, imaginative, and worth examining.<br />-The cast was great! Sometimes I regret casting choices but that could hardly be said for this film. Christina Ricci and Reese Witherspoon were fabulous and that is only the half of it!<br />-Aside from the fact that this is, at face value, a really charming tale there is a moral to the story.<br /><br />What I didn't like...<br />Honestly, I could not come up with anything I did not like.<br /><br />In summary...<br />Really, this is a very cute film and I highly recommend it. There are scenes with gambling and alcohol but I think most people would feel comfortable sharing Penelope with their children. The content is very family friendly and it is rated PG.<br />Overall, I think is a great film for romantics of all ages and I believe you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was!

The topic and drama renders no justice to what sometimes the media finishes without knowing the true ending to religious individuals accused sometimes of missdeeds they do not comit.

B0024F08RO|1.0|I watched Prison Break from the beginning and bought seasons 1-3 on DVD. I stuck with this show and then was repayed for my loyalty by the writers killing off the main character, Michael. Fans are irrate and the writers did not have to go this route. I won't be able to watch the previous seasons, nor will I recommend them to anyone, because what's the point. Michael, the good guy, that deserved his life back, gets it taken away. Michael would talk of hope and faith during the 4 seasons, but the writers went for shocking instead of a hopeful ending. I will not be buying season 4 DVD.

B000OCXF0Q|5.0|If you are reading this review because you are trying to decide whether to buy it or not, BUY IT!    This is her best CD ever and way better than the other ones, which are already good.  Every song is so good that I can't figure out a favorite yet because each one I listen to makes me think that is the one.  All of them are the one.    Even if you don't think you like her, get it.  We all have down days and on those, this music will pick you up from the ground, lift your spirit and fill you with energy.  There is no way you listen to this and don't dance and sing along.    Well, words alone cannot describe how amazing it it, so just get it!    BTW, if you have heard that her music is just for teenagers, not true, I left my teenager years a while back (long while) and I love it!!!!!    This will be the best CD in your collection.
B00006I53S|2.0|I loved this lens when I first got it, but after about a year of using it, it has peaked. I even sent it back to Canon - and paid over $100 - to have it calibrated and tweaked...and it's just not working right. I certainly used it a lot over the year, but a Canon lens should really perform longer than that. And after sending it back and spending the money to have it \\"fixed,\\" I'm done spending money on it. The focus is poor and the lens is not durable.

B0018AK9RA|4.0|In perhaps the most ambitious project in their nearly forty year history, Judas Priest unleashed `Nostradamus' on an unsuspecting metal populace last summer. Reviews have been mixed to say the least with most of the negative viewpoints surrounding the massive amounts of orchestration and mellower interludes that are interspersed throughout the double disc. Did their reach overextend their grasp? I really like this record but I have to agree with many of the reviews. The world was hoping that Priest would put out thrash masterpiece in the ancient traditions of `Sad Wings', `Sin After Sin\\" and `Stained Class'.  While `Nostradamus' is not the stupid mass appeal metal of the mid-eighties, it may not be everything their diehard fans want it to be. I do consider myself a diehard and I give the band all the credit in the world for following their muse and maybe if this LP contained a few more \\"Painkiller\\" or \\"Exciter\\" type songs then my rating would be five stars. Scott Travis, without question the greatest drummer Priest ever had seems to be underutilized here is most songs are slower tempo and not the double bass onslaught that his talents are tailor made for. Rob is of course Rob, the metal god with his talents used to their fullest extent (even singing in Italian, talk about true metal opera!). Maybe the band decided that in their twilight years, after the critical waxing they got from the Ripper-era albums, that  they would dip their toes in the pool on `Angel of Retribution' and go for the throat on `Nostradamus'.  Without any shred of irony, their latest seems to be clich&eacute; ridden but much of the music could make a case of how un-ironic and un-clich&eacute; metal can be in the right hands, the hands of the grand masters of the form.  The best songs include \\"Persecution\\" which is an amazing return to form - classic Judas Priest! Other faves include \\"Prophecy\\", \\"Pestilence and Plague\\" (the one with the Italian chorus), \\"Alone\\", \\"Visions\\" and the title track.  This may seem slight for a double disc lasting almost two hours but maybe that's why this record is not as good as fans wanted it to be. I plan on seeing these guys in July (a dream come true) and I am hoping they play some of the choice cuts from `Nostradamus'. Metal is a timeless art form and as long as Glenn, KK, Rob, Ian and Scott keep it together, Judas Priest can truly claim to be the Rolling Stones of heavy metal....but a hell of a lot cooler!slight for a double disc lasting almost two hours but maybe that's why this record is not as good as fans wanted it to be.

1582701709|1.0|I can't argue with those who have had their lives transformed, because even the blandest pablum will be transformative for some. All I can do here is plead with those in search of better karma, chi, destiny or what have you to turn to any the great thinkers she misquotes instead of this tripe.<br /><br />First of all, what bothers me is the vagueness of the assertions such as her claiming that \\"the greatest teachers who have ever lived have told us that the law of attraction is the most powerful law of the universe.\\" (She also cites numerous world religions--many with conflicting beliefs--in support of this outlandish statement.) The only way one could accept such sweeping generalizations is gross ignorance of the thinkers in question--if this book had even been brought to a publisher in a more literate time period, it would've been laughed out of the room. That is, if Plato, Shakespeare, and the many other luminaries actually said these things, it wasn't in any of the works I read as an English and Philosophy double major.<br /><br />The rest of the book continues in much the same vein: feel-good assertions so nebulous as to defy argument, and positive-thinking principles so simplistic they defy parody. To wit: \\"If you can think about what you want in your mind, and make that your dominant thought, you will bring it into your life.\\"<br /><br />I'm not saying this is the worst self-help book you could buy--I'm just saying you could do so much better.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I wish I had gotten HBO when this series started! This series is as colorful as a palette of oils. The characters are so different from one another that you can imagine yourself living in that little town. They are genuine and complex. And to mix it all up, are the murders that begin to happen all around Sookie Stackhouse, a waitress who seems to stay in the middle of it all. Sookie is never the same after a \\"coming out of the closet\\" Vampire named Bill walks through the door. And then the steamy sex happening all over town doesn't hurt either. I wish I lived there, those people know how to have a little fun! I totally recommend if you have or have not read the series. For those of us who have read the books the show offers us new subplots, for those who haven't read the books...well you're missing out on something only a novel can give you (using your imagination). This series is loaded with language, nudity and violence (so not for the youngin's) so you may not want to watch it with your dad!

B000068FY0|5.0|Many of the reviews so far have indulged in reminiscencing about the 1970s, discussed the clarity of the sound, or compared the band to Pink Floyd, the Beatles, or other musical influences. Very few have mentioned anything regarding the subject matter of the songs, as if there's nothing more to them than catchy tunes and a singalong chorus. I'd like to encourage future listeners to dig deeper into the words, because this is one of the best actual \\"concept albums\\" (an overused term) ever released. A concept album is more than just an album cover, a marketing campaign, or the band deciding, \\"Let's try something different this time.\\" It's a thread running through ALL of an album's songs - they're linked by a story, a recurring idea, or at the very least similar themes.    Crime of the Century's \\"concept\\" is the HUBRIS, or fatal flaws, of mankind. There are 8 total songs, 2 each of 4 different themes. For each of the 4 themes, Roger Hodgson offers the viewpoint of the introvert, followed by Rick Davies \\"answering\\" with the viewpoint of the extrovert on the same theme. The 4 themes are as follows:    1. PARANOIA: \\"School\\" and \\"Bloody Well Right\\" deal directly with the pressure exerted on individuals by academia, media, the political world, and even one's peers to conform to an idealized standard.    2. MENTAL ILLNESS: \\"Hide in your shell\\" and \\"Asylum\\" illustrate individuals who, having been failed by the aforementioned institutions, begin to lose their grip on reality when they have been denied love, trust, and respect.    3. SELF-DECEPTION /DISILLUSIONMENT: \\"Dreamer\\" and \\"Rudy\\" are about individuals who retreat into fantasy (sometimes of their own making, sometimes those of others) because they have nowhere else to turn to, only to be \\"awakened\\" when the fantasy doesn't last.    4. SELF-DESTRUCTION: \\"If everyone was listening\\" and \\"Crime of the Century\\" show mankind's fallen nature in the worst way - continuously making fatal choices, ignoring anyone who would sound thealarm, and looking for anyone but themselves to blame for their own foolishness.    While a bleak picture has been painted, never once does the album turn to despair or lapse into the morbidity and depression of the Prozac-rockers. The \\"message\\" seems to be that if we can begin by recognizing and admitting to our flaws, we can at least be prepared to deal with them and prevent them from stealing what is good about humanity: our capacity to love, create, and carry on beneath the shadow of death.    Messages aside, other commentators have written of the uniqueness of Supertramp's sound, and they are exactly right. Name another band that sounds like Supertramp. While not their very best album (I would vote for Crisis? What Crisis?), Crime of the Century is truly a timeless work of art that will be analysed and enjoyed for a long time to come. And it's one of the best-produced (credit: Ken Scott), detail-oriented albums ever! On \\"If everyone was listening\\", listen (especially with headphones) to the 3 notes on the ride cymbal when the vocal begins: left-channel, right-channel, left-channel. Fabulous!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Live In London is a stirring celebration of Cohen's music and poetry. The sound is sublime but what makes the album so extraordinary is the interaction between the singer, musicians and audience. There's mutual appreciation between the master, the players and the fans which in the case of the latter is expressed through hearty laughter, silent reverence or rapturous applause. This affectionate atmosphere refreshes the familiar songs whilst some of them reveal new angles through effective re-arrangements, unexpected instrumental flourishes or additional/personalized lyrics. Instruments like the archilaud, banduria and laud add a spacious dimension to the sound.<br /><br />From the outset the wry wit of Cohen's between-song banter establishes an intimate rapport, ameliorating the mournful or disturbing qualities in his work. His funny introduction to [[ASIN:B0012GMVDK The Future]], for example, counterbalances the song's frightening apocalyptic imagery. Leavened with humor, the concert ensures a listening experience filled with variety and emotional resonance. A Thousand Kisses Deep is performed as a spoken poem and includes more than the lyrics of the original song. Those that appear to benefit most from tweaked arrangements include Aint No Cure For Love, Bird On A Wire, Anthem with its introductory recital, Who By Fire with its long instrumental intro, the lilting Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye, In My Secret Life, Sisters of Mercy with its tender treatment and above all [[ASIN:B000002ISX Hallelujah]] which gains new meaning and power.<br /><br />The angelic female backing vocals - a Cohen trademark - are provided by Charley and Hattie Webb and [[ASIN:B00005Q45W Sharon Robinson]] who duets with Cohen on the aforementioned In My Secret Life and takes lead on the smoky Boogie Street with its eloquent sax. Exquisite throughout, these vocals bring significant depth to Take This Waltz, Tower of Song, Anthem and the prayer If It Be Your Will. The greater number of songs come from Cohen's post-1970s work, from albums like I'm Your Man, [[ASIN:B000025K9Y Various Positions]], The Future and Ten New Songs. The latest studio album [[ASIN:B0002MPTDO Dear Heather]] and the 1970s recordings Songs of Love & Hate and [[ASIN:B0000026K9 Death Of A Ladies Man]] are not represented at all whilst 1979's Recent Songs contributes only The Gypsy's Wife.<br /><br />New fans and Cohen completists might wish to investigate [[ASIN:B000059T3N Field Commander Cohen]], recorded in 1979 and released in 2000, which contains excellent live versions of compositions from Recent Songs and New Skin for the Old Ceremony as well as the track Memories from Death of a Ladies' Man. For an artist with such a long career, relatively few live albums were released; [[ASIN:B000OPO6WY tribute]] albums seem to outnumber the live ones! In its warmth and humanity, this album couldn't be more different from 1973's [[ASIN:B000007VW5 Live Songs]], an impressive but overall cold and often harrowing recording. Live In London concludes with Whither Thou Goest, a moving blessing from the Book of Ruth. This extraordinary recording is a perfect blend of presence, voices and playing of the highest caliber. Besides the track listing, musicians, instruments and credits, the CD booklet provides full-color photographs and notes by John Aizlewood.'s post-1970s work, from albums like I'm Your Man, [[ASIN:B000025K9Y Various Positions]], The Future and Ten New Songs.

B00110K62U|5.0|I am a Texas country boy who likes good old country music.  My review will not be from a life long experience listening to musicals and going to plays.  This story touched my soul like nothing I have ever experienced before.  The words of the songs give me hope that there is more to eternity than just what we have here and now.  I have watched this performance so many times in the past 2 months that I will probably have to go buy another copy.  The most remarkable change in me is I want to go to New York and see some plays and experience this missing part of my life.  Ruthie Henshall's I dreamed a dream is so much of what life has been for 62 years now.  I wish I were a good reader and could tackle the book by Hugo.  It would take me a year.  How poignant Les Miserables is even today 2009.  If I ever get a chance and the play comes to our country,,, no matter where, I will be there.  God bless all these wonderfully talented people.

0385340575|4.0|I've always loved the Jack Reacher novels, so I was glad that this one was more true to form than the last one.  It was fast paced and I had trouble putting it down.  I thought that it was more gory than usual, however.  I can recall one other book in the series that included passages that disturbed me, and this book had more than that one.   Too much torture and blood for me.  Also, I agree with the reviewer who said that the sex scene was gratuitous.  It seemed like Lee Child finished the book and then realized he forgot the obligatory sex scene, so threw in a couple of uninspired paragraphs.

And trust me, PBS woulda turned this turkey down in a heartbeat.

038073186X|4.0|Once again, Dennis Lehane writes a completely different book. Although I probably like his Patric Kenzie novels better, this is excellent. There is a fantastic twist ending, but the characters are much flatter than I would have liked. They aren't very memorable, although a few are complex. It is very well written also. Overall, a great read.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Worth seeing, but if you loved the lavish, over-the-top, 2006 production of \\"Casino Royale\\" you may be disappointed. The story begins immediately after \\"Casino Royale\\" ends and skips some of the Bond basics: the lounging elegance and wit, Miss Moneypenny, the fun high-tech gadgets, the opening gunshot, and the line \\"my name is Bond, James Bond.\\" The result is a relentless series of chases, much like the last Jason Bourne movie (everyone says this, and it's true). On the positive side, Judi Dench has a larger role as M and she keeps turning up to banter with Mr Bond. Other goodies include a lean, mean, Daniel Craig, a lean, mean script (much shorter than \\"Casino Royal\\") and a cat-and-mouse chase around a floating opera stage in the middle of a live performance of Puccini's \\"Tosca.\\" But the glamour, pleasure, and sense of mischief that pepper other Bond films are pretty scarce in this one. Gone, too, are the scenes from \\"Casino Royale\\" in which Craig could explore psychological drama at some length (the poker game, the torture scene, consoling Vesper in the shower). Keep your expectations in check and you should enjoy the ride. This film is mostly about revenge; not much solace here, but then perhaps that's the point.
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|I sometimes feel I should have enjoyed this movie, which aspires to be \\"challenging\\", a lot more than I did.  The story of crime and morality in the Nazi era is never one to be callow about, but this film seems like it's not sure what it wants to be about: the horrors of the concentration camps of Nazi Germany, legal issues and moral ambiguities, the nobility of a fallen woman, or kinky sex.  Kate Winslett seems like the real star of this movie, for which she finally won an Academy Award (uh-oh, does this mean that she'll never be in a good movie again?), and Ralph Fiennes plays her conflicted young lover as a conflicted adult. He frowns a lot.  Kate Winslet looks as young in \\"old lady makeup\\" in this film as she did in \\"Titanic.\\"  Will they never learn?

0684865130|5.0|Why did this 570-page book take me a month to read? Is it because I only read on the commute, is it because I often had work-related stuff to read on the commute, or is it because it's a tricky book to read? Paragraph by paragraph, Catch 22 is probably the funniest book I've ever read, some really hilarious bits. It's difficult to describe its hilarity, somehow, but the example below provides a pretty good description of its general wackiness. This is from a scene when the chaplain is being taken away by a colonel and a major and he asks \\"What have I done?\\"<br /><br />\\"Why don't you keep your trap shut and let us ask the questions?\\" said the colonel.<br />\\"Don't talk to him in that say,\\" said the major. \\"It isn't necessary to be so disrespectful.\\"<br />\\"Then tell him to keep his trap shut and let us ask the questions.\\"<br />\\"Father, please keep your trap shut and let us ask the quesiotions,\\" urged the major sympathetically. \\"It will be better for you.\\"<br />\\"It isn't necessary to call me Father,\\" said the chaplain. \\"I'm not a Catholic.\\"<br />\\"Neither am I, Father,\\" said the major. \\"It's just that I'm a very devout person, and I like to call all men of God Father.\\"<br />\\"He doesn't even believe there are atheists in fox-holes,\\" the colonel mocked, and nudged the chaplain in the ribs familiarly. \\"Go on, Chaplain, tell him. Are thre atheists in foxholes?\\"<br />\\"I don't know, sir,\\" the chaplain replied. \\"I've never been in a foxhole.\\"<br />The officer in front swung his had around swiftly with a quarrelsome expression. \\"YOu've never been in heaven either, have you? But you knnow there's a heaven, don't you?\\"<br />\\"Or do you?\\" said the colonel.<br />\\"That's a very serious crime you've committed, Father,\\" said the major.<br />\\"What crime?\\"<br />\\"We don't know yet,\\" said the colonel. \\"But we're going to find out. And we sure know it's very serious.\\"<br /><br />Taken as a whole, it's a bit hard to figure out what's going on, although by the time you get to the end of the book you do start to realise that the reason why it doesn't make sense is that he tells some parts of the story backwards: you'll learn an outcome that puzzles you because it came from out of nowhere, but throughout the rest of the book it's referenced often enough that you begin to piece together what actually happened. Heller's thesis is fascinating, if a little adolescent: everything and everybody is insane, especially during war. But because he takes it to such an extent - you'd have to be crazy to want to fight, you'd have to be crazy to want to kill, you'd have to be crazy to fly air force missions, you can only get out of the war if you're mentally unstable but if you were rational enough to want to get out of the war you could not claim insanity; also systems are insane, bureaucracy is insane, commerce is insane, the military system is insane - it provides him with so much material that he has no problem filling a whole book about the insanity of a single army unit. In the end, it seems that I enjoyed the book in spite of myself.

B00005BJ9W|1.0|Other reviewers have correctly pointed out that this CD was made from the original UK release, not the version remixed by David Kershenbaum that was released later in the US, and that most US listeners consider to be the \\"official\\" release.    Even casual listeners will notice the differences. I know that some folks will always say that the original versions are better by virtue of being first, but in this case, I think the record company got it right --- the US mixes are considerably more punchy and poppy. The UK mixes are comparatively dull-edged.    Unfortunately, the only way to hear the US mix of Rio is to get a vinyl copy (they are widely available wherever used vinyl is sold)    This seems like such a comical oversight in an era where every remix, alternate version etc is available on CD somewhere. Some lawyer must have screwed up in 1982 and nobody has the rights to the US version. Or something.

0385340567|2.0|This book was an error on the part of Mr. Child (recently outed by the NYT with his real name and brother). Lets count the errors:    1-The book mentions that Reacher has been out of the Army for 10 years. So he has lived as a vagrant and murderer for 10 years, and of course his direct connection with the Army is waning. His life is nothing that ought serve as a role model for anyone. Whats the goal beyond buying more clean underwear at WalMart?    2- The politics is showing. Reacher now supports an underground railway of deserters from the Iraq War. So much for country and Army. And the bad guy is a military contractor and evangelical Christian-can we spell \\"Republican\\"?     3- The story has 4 or 5 quasi-sub-plots with no real meaning; the test for subplots is to imagine the book with them totally edited out-would you have missed them at all?    4- Reacher's obligatory 3-night stand with the local policewoman is a fit-in module basically the same as in 5 or 6 of his other books.    5- In this book, Reacher clearly crosses the line to murderer. Perhaps he did so in earlier books, but here there are no doubts as to his willingness to kill to make himself feel better. This makes him a bit less admirable as a character to look forward to in future books as he aimlessly bums around the country on his killing spree. Reach has actually reached the status of serial killer, though the FBI does not connect the dots as yet.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I've been waiting for a long time for a Rock album that i will be proud to still talk about 10 years from now and probably longer. It's just magnificent, raw, emotional, powerful.   Listen with a good pair of headphones, beginning to end, no shuffling, simply amazing. There are so many layers that it will take you several listens to really get it.  I was speechless after the few first listens, and everytime it stayed with me for a long time.   I've been a fan since Leviathan, and love all their albums, but this is insanely good. And if you can catch them live, go, do not miss them.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movie is everything that has been missing from the franchise since the original series. A incredible mix of Action, adventure, plot, drama and dropping the feel good lets save everyone from themselves attitude. Not only was this movie a huge success in my opinion a new series could be born from this as long as it continues to follow the same path as the movie. As a side note Leonard Nimoy was perfectly placed in this movie. This is a great movie to see in the theatre and a Bluray purchase is a no brainer!
B000SEK28S|2.0|Being an avid knitter and having lived in Seattle I thought this would be a great book. The premise is likable- three women and a shop owner from different backgrounds getting to know one another in a knitting group. Within the forst few chapters the author repeats herself so often it gets annoyoing. Clarifying things that were obvious from the get-go, \\"Just when I was getting ready to close I saw my sister walking across the street toward the shop. She had only come here once before, on my first day of business. She'd taken such pride in forecasting financial disaster...\\" yeah, we know that... we read that interaction 20 pages ago. And she does this several times, it's strange- as if she wrote each chapter to be stand alone... or she thinks her readers won't remember.     What bothered me the most was how out of touch the writer seems to be with the younger generation. The young character in the novel is punk- black leather pants, purple mohawk. Nothing shocking in Seattle! Yet she is painted with such generalities, angry, no self esteem... all she needs is to go to church and get a nice makeover! Voila! Give me a break. I seriously had to go back and see how long ago this was written because I can't imagine anyone being so out of touch with the younger generation. I was saddened to read that it was only 5 years ago- the author has a narrow view of young people thinking that church and a long skirt and blouse with cuffs that button at the wrist is what will make her happy.

B001N26GFC|1.0|This movie is extremely unpleasant to watch.  In addition to an intensely unlikeable lead character, the plot is a mess, best seen in the Poppy character being so at odds with the movie's stated intent (from its description).<br /><br />I couldn't decide whether the lead character Poppy was mentally ill or just evil.  There is evidence both ways, but leans to the former.  At times she seems to be using a forced oblivious cheerfulness as a defense or coping mechanism against the serious problems in her own life.<br /><br />But in the relationship with the driving instructor Scott, she spots his vulnerability--that he takes pride in his work--and ruthlessly exploits it.  She is intent on making his life miserable, and to amuse herself, she is quite willing--through intentionally bad driving--to risk killing someone or destroy Scott's livelihood (his car).  An alternate interpretation is that this spreading of misery to others is a coping mechanism.<br /><br />One thing Poppy is not is \\"happy-go-lucky\\" (with the possible exception of the bike theft in the opening).  There are several instances where she drops out of the \\"cheerful\\" persona to behave as a responsible adult, for example the troubled boy at school and the ending (that comes out of nowhere).  An actual happy-go-lucky person would have behaved quite differently.  Also, happy-go-lucky people tend to try to spread joy, not misery, to those around them.  Instead, Poppy is relentlessly self-involved, self-absorbed, obnoxious, ...  To call her simply \\"annoying\\" is to miss the point.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Unfortunately, in choosing this movie, I relied solely on movie critic's reviews, not consulting Amazon, so I kept watching expecting something positive.  Recognize that the reviews here are much more negative than the simple composite score once you discount the multiple (positive) reviews that echo the movie's promotional materials.  Also, the Amazon entry under Editorial Reviews above (by Bret Fetzer) initially seems quite positive, but contains many warnings when read carefully (paying attention to word choices and phrasing).<br /><br />Aside: Regarding the driving instructor character Scott, Americans should understand that Britain takes a much more rigorous approach to driving instruction and tests than we do.  When I lived there (1987), I heard from other Americans with many years of driving experience that they were skeptical about their ability to pass the British test.  Scott is expected to teach students discipline, alertness and responsibility.  In their negative take on this character, the director and script writers would seem to add further weight to their presentation of anti-social behavior as being fun-loving.s many warnings when read carefully (paying attention to word choices and phrasing).

B001P9KR8U|5.0|All I knew about this movie, before seeing it, was that it had won some awards and had some buzz attached to it.  I was blown away by how good the script was.  It is one of those movies that you really have to pay attention throughout the entire movie to piece things together as the movie evolves.  The script is smart, has its funny moments, and is unpredictable, which makes it fun.    You will find yourself rooting for and against the main character at different points within the movie.  The love story that runs throughout the script is done well, and is fun to watch as it evolves.    This is a must-see for everyone.  Enjoy!

Throughout the book he has to slow sown and explain how he is using many of the words as we usually give them different meaning. Then there are a few times that he has to turn to Indian words instead of making up new ones. Many say he is based in Ancient Vedic concepts yet if you did not know of them you would relies these are concepts of the now.<br />He hits the deck running with this book so if you have not been exposed to these concepts before you may need to re-read the book several times.

0553208845|4.0|I found this book to be quite profound and interesting, even though I do not agree with its message in its entirety.<br /><br />While the book suggests different paths to enlightenment, such as the one experienced by Siddhartha (by observing nature and reflecting upon it), I feel that the Buddha's message may have carried more weight as it considers even physical aspects of nature to be an illusion, a veil covering the true essence of reality; although I am not a Buddhist, am not enlightened and can neither confirm nor disprove either of the approaches laid out in the book. Nonetheless, I do believe that it is important to have different experiences in life (just as the Buddha himself did) instead of starting out as a monk or an ascetic right from a young age and avoiding everything else - which Govinda, Siddhartha's friend made the mistake of doing, because he sought answers from everyone else but himself and followed blindly instead of going his own way. I suppose some might say that that's a little like not wanting to learn from others' experiences but we need to experience certain things for ourselves even if we have been warned. What does not kill us, makes us stronger and wiser.<br /><br />I also found this book to have parallels with Jiddu Krishnamurti's \\"Freedom From The Known\\".
B001IB63KQ|5.0|For the record:<br />This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. And I'm not just talking about music.<br /><br />'The Final Riot!' was a creative display of Paramore's absolute best, from melodies to anthems, not to mention the raw energy and enthusiasm vibrating off of the Chicago crowd. It was the first live DVD I ever bought that I was able to sit and watch start to finish. It actually inspired me to purchase tickets to see them in concert.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />- The rhythm guitar leading into the band's first song, \\"Born For This\\", was an incredible opening to the show. It was also a great choice of song to start with. It immediately provokes interaction between the band and the fans, just electrifying the atmosphere and setting the tone for the show.<br /><br />- \\"Fences\\" is just a fun song to listen to, period. Live, much of the same. It's groovy, it's fast, and it rocks.<br /><br />- The verses to \\"Crushcrushcrush\\" were slowed down and mellowed out considerably. I loved the way it was done and was more impressed with the way Hayley handed off the lead vocals of \\"they taped over your mouth...\\" to the crowd and did the background vocal herself.<br /><br />- \\"Let The Flames Begin\\" is one of the band's hardest songs. It's more of a guy's song than your sugarcoated \\"That's What You Get\\", so naturally I love the song. Hayley Williams is a stellar performer, and this one is boiling with raw emotion, a characteristic so rare in modern music. Sensational track to see live.<br /><br />- \\"My Heart\\" is generally a great song, but the live version was showcased more for Hayley Williams' voice than the guitar and background vocals, as on the 'All We Know Is Falling' album. Real slow, moving jam.<br /><br />- \\"Pressure\\" for the old school fans. Nothing original about it, but I just plain love the song.<br /><br />- \\"Hallelujah\\" is not one of my favorite songs by Paramore. However, I loved their live take on it, starting with Leonard Cohen's song \\"Hallelujah\\" (brought to the limelight by Jeff Buckley), and making a smooth transition into their own song of the same name. One of the best moments of the whole concert.<br /><br />- \\"Misery Business\\", period. It's just a sick song.<br /><br />* The interview sessions with the band, which broke up the concert every couple of songs, were intriguing and in depth, including some home videos, highlights of their platinum record presentation and reflections on the concert in Chicago, their takes on living out of a bus and much more.<br />I'm not a big fan of listening to bands talk about their lives as famous recording artists, but Paramore is very down to Earth.

B0000683DH|5.0|So I originally posted this review with 3 stars, going into great detail and complaining about how incompetent a villain Khan was.  And then it took some time and thinking to realize the film isn't about Khan---it's about revelation and realization, that terrible sensation that is a common trope in any adventure series featuring close friends: the moment where one realizes that they are not invincible.<br /><br />Admiral Kirk has gone through the vast majority of his career smoothly, a stalwart hero as likely to resolve a conflict with words as with fists, and always able to rely on his trusty friends.<br /><br />And he's bored.  He's old, he's bored, and he can't stand it.<br /><br />His career-long invincibility was actually a crutch to him, as he had glided through for so long, always having an escape plan or a secret option to escape from defeat.  The Kobayashi Maru \\"no-win scenario\\" running plot-MacGuffin is in no way a Red Herring---it comes back around and smashes Kirk in the face when he realizes his refusal to accept a no-win scenario worked for him in the past, but it will never truly work out in the end.<br /><br />Spock dies.  That's not a spoiler; it's a forgone conclusion.  Spock's death isn't just a tacked-on \\"SHOCKING SWERVE~!\\" thing I had originally called it in my review.  Spock's death was in no way something to justify Khan being considered such a fiendish villain.<br /><br />Spock's death was that moment, that revelation.  It was the moment Kirk realized there IS no cunning solution to the Kobayashi Maru.  It was the moment Kirk realized he is NOT invincible.  Indeed, Khan (at least until movie three) did exactly what he wanted to do to Kirk---he hurt him.  And he made sure Kirk would go on hurting, for a long while.<br /><br />Kirk himself states at the end that he \\"feels young\\".  In fact, he does.  Having lost his best and closest friend, he is suddenly shown that he is not immortal, and he cannot loll through missions and commands expecting everything to work out in the end because it's \\"Star Trek\\".  He has cheated death all his life through all his missions, and death finally strikes him, not where it could do the most damage, but where it could HURT him most significantly.<br /><br />Khan is still a lackluster villain to me.  Ricardo Montalban is magic with his acting talent, and brings an epic, operatic quality to Khan Noonien Singh.  But that's about it.  There's a huge multitude of parallels with Khan, the character and the movie, involving \\"Moby Dick\\" and \\"Hamlet\\" and \\"King Lear\\", and spectacularly executed with Khan's mirroring of Captain Ahab, blindly chasing his quarry, to the death and destruction of himself.<br /><br />Above all, it's worth mentioning this is NOT an action movie.  It's an insult to this movie and it's dramatic, operatic quality to call it as such, especially when comparing it to \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\".  It's a common barb of fans of The Motion Picture to claim people like Wrath of Khan more because it's more action-packed.<br /><br />No, it's not.  People like Wrath of Khan more because of the STORY and the depth and skill by which it is told, with deep themes on weighty issues such as death, aging, rebirth, and revenge, that resonate through all time, and are handled in a highly complex manner which most people would completely miss from their first viewing of the film, likely due to the stigma of \\"geekiness\\" and \\"goofy garbage\\" that Star Trek has.<br /><br />\\"The Motion Picture\\" was an adaptation of a failed TV series pilot featuring the original crew.  It involved a 30 minute story dragged out to nearly 2 hours, with blatant padding all around, from a FOUR MINUTE UNCUT sequence of just Kirk and Scott looking at the Enterprise while SLOWLY flying around it in a transport pod, to EVEN MORE SEQUENCES EVEN LONGER of the crew just staring into V'Ger's cloud, and arbitrarily cutting back to people's faces as they stare out the window.  \\"2001\\" Star Gate sequence this ain't.<br /><br />The Motion Picture was full of long periods of nothing, and a very powerful theme of obsession---that of Kirk with command of the Enterprise---that was childishly \\"resolved\\" not by any character development or revelation, but by having the one person opposing his command (Decker) conveniently exit the picture without really dying, but more or less dying.<br /><br />Wrath of Khan does not avoid any weighty issues or themes.  There is no quickfix solution to anything.  Kirk can't just have Khan's ship explode, then shield the Enterprise in some kind of Nebular vacuum spot where he can survive the Genesis explosion.  Kirk can't just blast Khan out of the sky and fly home victorious.<br /><br />In some way, Kirk has earned redemption in this film for all the swaggering and slickness of his days of youth in The Original Series.  He is hurting, and he will go on hurting...<br /><br />At least until Star Trek III: Search for Spock.g, and a very powerful theme of obsession---that of Kirk with command of the Enterprise---that was childishly \\"resolved\\" not by any character development or revelation, but by having the one person opposing his command (Decker) conveniently exit the picture without really dying, but more or less dying.

B0013FNC38|5.0|I love this Cd. When I go for long drives I have to bring this cd and just sing at the top of my lungs as I blast the radio.  Love it! Hope to catch him in concert soon.
B001U7FWMI|5.0|This is a great album.  Every song is solid.  I havent listened to much Grizzly Bear before this, I've only heard a song or two on Sirius XMU.  I love the booklet, and since it's LP the booklet is big enough to really see stuff, like most of their gear.  Some of the gear you can spot in the picture is an EHX HOG, a Mu-Tron Phasor II, EXH Stereo Memory Man, EHX Small Stone, Moog Moogerfooger Murf, Moog Moogerfooger ???, a couple of Boss stompboxes, etc.  See what you can spot, and comment on it below.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|This 3 disc collection is the ultimate for a Titanic Fanatic (of which I am not one). This has more information than most viewers will ever need or want to know about the making of this movie. I did enjoy the \\"making of\\" featurettes and the underwater sequences that explored the interior decks. All in all it was worth the price I paid in its used condition which was in like-new shape. I like the movie well enough and will watch and enjoy it. It is a welcome addition to my collection.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|if you're expecting a bloody vampire horror film this may not be it.<br />I think it's misguiding to refer to is as a horror film, but it's a hell of a love story.<br />Even though it deals with younger main characters, that in no way effects the impact of the story which is full of redemption.<br />Seriously, I'm not one who will seek out love stories etc. and have to admit I rented this due to belief that it was a horror/vampire movie. But I have to admit I'm really glad I was able to see it and will purchase it if I already have not. It really is one of the most beautiful and fulfilling love stories I have seen, which is not many, but none have stuck with me like this.<br />So give it a chance; and if you do like a good love story and were worried about gore etc. you should love it too.<br />also many have mentioned problems with the subtitles; the copy I rented from blockbuster was fine although I was not able to check the box to see if it was a revised version.<br />totally worth it though in any fashion.
B001TODCII|4.0|I usually enjoy movies like \\"Taken\\"--violence with purpose and edge-of-your- seat action--but this time, I was too aware that I was watching a movie, not experiencing the story, and unable to suspend my disbelief. Bottom line: Although the story is plausible (a slaver underworld run by \\"foreigners\\" is rife in Paris), I couldn't get past the fact that this was a movie.<br /><br />First, I appreciate that Liam Neesom had the opportunity to play this character. In an interview some years ago Denzel Washington explained his role in \\"Virtuosity.\\" His son was a little embarrassed that HIS father had not performed in the role of an action figure, thus the film with Russell Crowe. I suspect Neesom had reasons, too, to step out of weighty roles into a vengeance seeker. And he is certainly allowed!<br /><br />However, here are things that took away from my 5-star commitment:<br />1. I'm sorry but Neesom is too old to do all the physical things he did. The viewer should have been given some clue that Neesom was still physically fit, e.g. working out in a gym, playing handball, something. Showing him wax nostalgic on his sofa over emotionally losing his daughter through years of job-related neglect made me think the opposite: uh-oh, couch potato in early retirement. Also, the tricky camera shots usually in a darkened atmosphere made it easy for a body double to do the stunt work in those one man against many fights.<br /><br />2. His daughter Kimmy was impossibly silly. I will leave it at that.<br /><br />3. The mother allowing two teenage girls to track a rock group across Europe was impossibly silly. What was the woman thinking? What world does she live in? Oh yeah, the world of the rich and pampered. I congratulate Neesom's character for not saying, I told you so, at the end. Justifiably, he could have!<br /><br />4. Where did that bag of fluids come from that he used on the poor girl he \\"took\\" out of slaving? I don't doubt that he has done that before (put in a drip), but how did he get it? Just one of those things he was carrying in his duffel bag? That seems really far-fetched.<br /><br />5. And the girl!! What happened to her? Does he just leave her? Note: I just learned that the girl is left at a safe house. Thank goodness!<br /><br />6. And the worst: When Neesom is finally caught and suspended from a pipe, how he escapes is really too much!<br /><br />7. Somehow I find it difficult to believe that even a retired \\"government worker\\" could leave Paris without being detained. There were too many dead bodies after Neesom rampaged through Paris. We know he didn't leave Paris without seeing some doctor. His arm was bandaged when he stepped off the plane.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are many believable points: totally devoting himself to salvaging his relationship with his daughter, saving the rock star and earning her undying gratitude, killing without remorse in the cause of rescuing his daughter, unflinching violent action when needed, forging ahead fearlessly. It's these kinds of things that make or break an action movie. Because of Liam Neesom's commanding presence and talent (not fully utilized in this movie), as well as the points listed in this paragraph, I DO recommend the film with a nod of acknowledgment to what I consider less than perfect components.<br /><br />New point: Kimmy didn't know the nature of her father's work, making their alienation caused by long-term absences more real. On the way to the airport, he told her he was a \\"preventer.\\" By movie's end she saw exactly what he did--up close and personal--and had a new appreciation for her dad. That alone is worth the ticket price!e was carrying in his duffel bag? That seems really far-fetched.    5. And the girl!! What happened to her? Does he just leave her?

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Let me first start off by talking about all of the sad moments in most of the Pixar movies (this will make more sense when you keep on reading the review.) Toy Story: When Buzz realizes he's a toy and can't cope with it, and when Woody admits that he should be strapped to the rocket and not buzz. A Bugs Life: When Flick is ran out of town because everyone finds out the HERO bugs were just circus bugs. Toy Story 2: When Jesse tells her story about a girl who loved her but then gave her away because she was to old. Monsters Inc.:(the best one before UP) When Sully has to bring boo back to where she came from, and when he finally sees her again after a couple of years. Finding Nemo: The opening scene, when Dory and Marlin are splitting up, and when Nemo and Marlin finally see each other again. The Incredibles: Can't remember any sad moments in that movie unfortunately. Cars: When Lightning helps the old Vet get across the finish line, and when Lightning finally falls for Route 66. Ratatouille: Can't remember anything unfortunately and I never saw WALL-E because my friend told me how boring it actually was. So now is the review.    This was probably the best Pixar movie hands down. I have never seen a movie that was so perfect in everything. Even the pre movie  that Pixar does was perfect. So the plot is that a man named Mr. Fredrickson is a guy who people think he would never be on an adventure. That is until one day a million balloons come out of the house and he starts floating off to S. America. Unfortunately he brings a cub scout named Russel along for the ride. There are many adventures the duo goes through along the way, from finding a rare bird, to meeting a talking dog. They go through everything. Here is why though the movie is one of the best ever. It is the most emotional and heart warming movie anyone will ever see. The emotional scenes are countless and they really are tear jerkers from the start. Like the background on why Mr. Fredrickson never leaves hishouse, when some guy nearly sets the house on fire by Charles Muntz (you'll find out who he is in the movie), The badge Russel gets, and the ending on where the house lands up. However there is one scene though that literally made everybody... and I mean everybody start crying in the theater which is extremely rare for any movie to do(For anyone that did see the movie I think you know which scene I'm talking about.)I have to commend everyone that worked on this film. It really was the perfect 4 star movie. In fact it's so good that it's a shame that the Academy won't vote this for best picture(trust me it was that good.) So if you are thinking about seeing this movie... then you should definately see this movie. You will love it and won't regret it.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams, the HBO miniseries is a phenomenal account of the beginnings of our great country, as well as an insightful look into the personal and family life of one of our founding fathers. It is a lesson on American History that I've never before seen so well portrayed. The authenticity of the times and places is remarkable, historians would agree. Only through the details of the lives of the people that lived during that exciting time in our history, can we truly know what they endured in their daily lives - and how much they sacrificed for the freedoms we enjoy (currently) today.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series as one to have in any home video library, as well as any school library as it tells the story of the birth of American as no \\"history\\" book can - with vivid details and imagery. I did not read David McCullough's book, on which this series was based, but I can only imagine its own depth, given the amount of information conveyed in the film.<br /><br />A word on the acting: Masterful. For a piece such as this, casting is critical and the producers hit the mark. Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney, David Morse, Tom Wilkinson and Sarah Polley are among the top talent Hollywood has, and they came together to perform this account fantastically.
B000VZP9G4|4.0|I don't know how I feel about him sampling one of the greatest songs ever written (lyrically speaking). All Falls Down is a lyric from Mystery of Iniquity by Lauryn Hill which is one of the most convicting/life giving songs I have ever heard. that woman loves the LORD like CRAZINESS and her Unplugged record reflects it. Get it. Soak in what she is saying. You won't regret it. That album has brought me to tears time after time.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|This was a movie that kept me rapt for two hours.  It seemed much shorter than that.  I can't wait for the dvd release.  I usually rent movies and don't buy them.<br /><br />In this new Star Trek, JJ Abrams was wise to start from scratch.  The best creative minds were getting tripped up on canon.  The franchise had been left for dead after \\"Enterprise\\".  Starting the Original series from day one scene one with a time travel plot was the best option.<br /><br />We see the young Kirk as an ambitious, talented, and rebellious cadet.  Spock is equally driven as an accomplished Commander in Star Fleet.  They meet as foes at Kirk's Court Martial.  Dr. McCoy, disillusioned by a recent divorce and life, joins Star Fleet.  Sulu and Chekhov are two bright Star Fleet cadets.  Uhura, a gifted linguist, rounds out the crew.  Scotty, the miracle working engineer, comes later.  They are led by Capt. Christopher Pike.  All of Star Fleet is called on an emergency as the planet Vulcan is under attack by the Romulans.<br /><br />These Romulans are not those seen in all of the Star Trek TV series.  They don't have the Beatle haircuts and they are not soldiers.  They have technology beyond Kirk's time that could destroy life in the galaxy.  Their leader, Nero, is driven by revenge.  The Enterprise is all that stands in the way of Nero's plans.<br /><br />What I liked about the movie is that all of our Original Series characters are given the opportunity to shine.  Sulu is not chained to the helm and gets to do some literal swashbuckling.  The 17 year old Chekhov shows his talent with ships systems and Navigation.  I kept thinking that this was how Wesley Crusher should have been written in The Next Generation.  That is, having some spectacular saves AND misses.  Spock is brilliant, priggish, and in conflict with his Vulcan/Human heritage.  Kirk doesn't always get the girl.  He underwhelms Uhura.  Speaking of, she gets to do more than say, \\"Hailing frequencies open.\\"<br /><br />What about the bad guys?  Eric Bana made the most of his role as Nero.  The explanation given for Nero in the movie was a flimsy one.  Bana did,however, make the most of it as a fine character actor.  I have liked his work in Troy[[ASIN:B0002Z0EYK Troy (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)]]as Hector and as Henry VIII in the otherwise abysmal The Other Boleyn Girl[[ASIN:B001AB3HHQ The Other Boleyn Girl - Movie Poster - 11 x 17]].<br /><br />The appearance of Leonard Nimoy?  I'm divided.  Abrams is giving his respects to the original series while at the same time starting the new franchise with the use of Nimoy.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to future Star Trek movies with this rebooted crew.t the bad guys?

0784011176|5.0|An excellent story - Holly Hunter does a superior job at her part.  I've always liked Sam Neill's work, and Harvey Keitel fits his part so well.  Anna Paquin as the little girl connects with the plot in a special way.  And a great surprise end!
0618918248|5.0|If you are an agnostic like I was then PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE read this book.  Thanks to this book I no longer believe in - nor, more importantly, live my life in fear of - God, the Devil, ghosts or anything else invented over the past several millenniums by our species' wonderfully creative imagination.  Everything mysterious (thunder and lightning, the sun, misfortune, fortune, etc) that the human race has ever attributed to supernatural forces (gods, demons, ghosts, God, etc) has already been explained by, or can be explained by, natural causes.  And that's the real Good News.

It is extremely easy to read and understand and I truly feel that if everyone would know what their Love Language is that more marriages would last and there would be more happiness in our homes, work environments and in the general public.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|It's an Aliens plus Vikings movie. The special effects are impressive. The dragons look life-like and vicious. The fighting scenes are bloody. For example, there's a scene where a person was beheaded by the tail of the dragon. The suspense is gripping. For example, when the dragon hunted people and ate them in the fortress at night.    The background scenes are spectacular. They show gigantic mountains, and beautiful waterfall.     The love story is briefly depicted but it's touching.    In short, it's definitely worth watching. I own it.

0525421033|5.0|If I Stay completely blew me away. I was expecting a lot out of it and it delivered every little bit and more.    The beginning, right after the crash, was a little bit confusing to me. This may not be the case for everyone but I remember looking at it and going \\"Wait, WHAT?!\\" but instead of taking away from the story, it actually helped me delve deeper into the story line. Once I had everything figured out, I was completely pulled into the story it. Most of the time I didn't even realize that I was reading - it was just that good.    Mia was a character I felt completely connected to. Her voice was unique and heartbreaking and kept you attached to the story line. Anyone who has every felt lost and unsure what the point of life is or who is attached to music in a way that no one seems to understand will connect with her immediately. The rest of the family and other various characters were only developed in bits and pieces but that's only because it takes place in the course of a day or so and most of them are only present for a chapter or two, if that.    The plot, as I said before, takes place over a short period of time which makes the pacing a teeny bit awkward but there's tons of flashbacks to help us get a better understand of the story which helps balance it all out.    As for the ending...well, it's beautiful and crazy and sad and perfect.    This really is a powerful story and I look forward to seeing what the producers can do to make a decent movie out of this.    harmonybookreviews.wordpress.com
B001UREJWM|2.0|I liked Bible Black, and Fear. Other than that his album is just a throwaway.<br /><br />Shame since I LOVE the Dio-Era Black Sabbath. When I heard they were putting out a new album you couldn't tell how excited I was. But then I bought it...<br /><br />I went through the tracks. 75% of the songs start off with the same mid-tempo and slow intro. And then Dio starts singing. Seriously, Dio's vocals are so boring on here, it sounds like he's reading them off a paper.<br /><br />Of the 10 tracks here, 2 stand out- the single and Fear. Eating the Cannibals is one I'm on the fence about, since it`s really catchy but has some of the worst lyrics ever. And the opener Atom and Evil- is that the best they could do? Slow and plodding intro, and then Dio babbling nonsense. The Turn of the Screw has the potential to be amazing... but then they got to the chorus.<br /><br />Really, this album is just a disappointment.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|Without a doubt one of the most boring pretentious pieces of twaddle I have ever had the misfortune to watch.  Only two things wrong with this movie, 1)some one made it, 2) I watched it.    If you took away the dialogue, music, acting, scenery, cinematography and costumes, you would have \\"Ishtar\\" and that would still be an improvement over this movie.  For the first ten minutes there is no dialogue but some of the worst background music you've ever heard that had nothing to do with what was happening.  There are so many pregnant pauses in this movie I was afraid it would give birth to something worse.  Grumbling and growling do not make a movie.    Half the time we have no idea who the people are who pass through this movie, they're there and then they're gone.  The writer/director based the movie on an obscure 'Upton Sinclair' novel; he should have left it buried in the library.  A good deal of the movie is spent watching people staring, not doing anything but staring or just walking.  You can cut the tension with a feather, please.    Should I ever meet Paul Thomas Anderson (sounds like a serial killer), I would be tempted to tie him to a chair, tape open his eyes and make him watch 'Andy Warhol's Empire State Building' which is 24 hours of watching the ESB and that's still better than this movie and makes more sense.      This is the kind of movie that gives 'Art Movies' a bad name, or any moving picture for that matter.  My dad's 8mm of our trip to the Grand Canyon in 1956 had better dialogue and it was silent, and the acting was better.      In all truth I would have liked to have given this move a -1; they owe me for watching it.  All copies should be collected and sent to North Korea, so they can build a big fire and cook over it.  'Nuf said.    [...]

Some say leo is not a good actor but he wouldn't be paid the big bucks if most people believed that, Leo D. is a very capable actor and plays this part very well and Russell Crowe adds to the film as well. They work well together and the movie was thrilling to the end. I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who might not give a movie in this genre a try.   It has the drama, technology, action and thrilling story to keep you guessing the whole time. 5 stars!
0385340575|4.0|Jack Reacher is in the Big Apple in Lee Child's \\"Gone Tomorrow.\\"  He is just passing through, minding his own business, but as usual, trouble follows Reacher wherever he goes.  This time, he is heading uptown on the number six train at two o'clock in the morning when he spots a woman who is displaying many of the behavioral indicators of a suicide bomber.  Reacher approaches her and tries to talk her down, but he unwittingly ends up making a bad situation worse.  This incident will have wide-ranging ramifications and will eventually involve an ambitious member of Congress, the New York City Police Department, the FBI, and the Department of Defense.  Our hero, naturally, becomes a target, and he will need to make good use of his superior brainpower and awesome fighting ability to outsmart and overpower those who want him dead.<br /><br />Child, who is British, long ago earned a cult following.  His books are now a must read for those who enjoy escapist action-adventure novels.  Reacher is the prototype of the taciturn loner who cares little about material possessions, but like a lawman in the old West, travels from town to town to clean up the messes created by more fallible human beings.  Jack is sharp and observant; he scrutinizes people's dress, body language, and speech for subtle clues that less alert people often miss.  Although he is no longer a youngster, Reacher can still handle a weapon with ease and more than holds his own in hand-to-hand combat.<br /><br />The plot of \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" involves a pair of bloodthirsty villains who enter the United States under false pretenses.  Jack finds himself in their crosshairs; at the same time, he is caught in the middle of nasty turf wars between competing law enforcement agencies.  Although he could have walked away from this mess, Reacher decides to get involved for reasons of his own, and the result is a grueling and bruising encounter with some extremely malicious adversaries.  This is a fast-paced and entertaining novel with intriguing tidbits about renting a hotel room on the cheap, various ways to elude your pursuers in subway tunnels, and how duct tape can save your life.  Child has fun leading us and his protagonist down the garden path with a host of red herrings and false information.  This book has its share of violent confrontations, a dollop of romance, and enough excitement to keep Child's fans eagerly turning pages, wondering how their favorite macho man will get himself out of yet another impossible situation.ntriguing tidbits about renting a hotel room on the cheap, various ways to elude your pursuers in subway tunnels, and how duct tape can save your life.

0374531269|4.0|The saga of Sierra Leone's two wrenching civil wars has not received enough attention in the press for a long while now. I guess if it was a major oil producer, this would have been different.     Child soldiers continue to be the victims and unfortunately aggressors in many conflicts in Africa. This despicable practice has been used by both rebels and govt forces as a convenient way to prey on children's desperation and poverty. Beah's story also gives a faint glimmer of hope to people working hard to bring these hardened killers back to some normalcy. These kids are killers and simple justice dictates that they be punished to 'set an example'. However it serves nobody any good by just dumping these kids in jails or executing them. Rehabbing them is the best hope to slowly fight and end this practice.     The book could have gone a little bit more in detail about Beah's thought process as he evolved from a simple village kid to a killing machine. Maybe he had a hard chronicling it in words. Either way, the book is a must read. His journey back from the abyss is also testament to the heroic efforts of all the aid workers who made it possible. I hope Beah works at helping other child soldiers since he does have a unique perspective.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles (aka The White Album) as a whole, is perhaps the perfect album.  It has to be listened to in its entirety, no skipping around.  From the opening jet sounds of \\"Back in the USSR\\" to the screaming riffs of \\"Helter Skelter\\", The Beatles will take you back to the late 60's in a heartbeat.  Even Ringo's \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" with its chugging melody will have you tapping your toes.  A must have for any Beatles fan or for someone who hasn't listened to their music in awhile. In case you've forgotten how truly great this band was, this one will refresh your memory.  Don't pass it up.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|In my opinion, the HBO series is NOTHING like the books!     The characters are NOTHING like the characters in the books.     AND to top it all off, the series does not follow the storylines in the books.    I am currently reading book 3 Club Dead. Almost done. I am so confused after having watched this series while reading the books that I am going to go back and start the books over.   They have twisted the story so much in the HBO series that it (to me) barely resembles the books. And it is only the first season!  Save the money and read the books.  They are really GREAT!  Sorry but... This series \\"Sucks\\"- LOL
B000PC0U1W|3.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" is more than just a masked terrorist running amuck in a futuristic Britain; it is more than just the quick wits of an anti-hero challenging the government; and it is far more than just the follow-up film from the Wachowski brothers.  This is a philosophical cinematic entry disguised as a blockbuster.  While most will argue that it is a poor excuse for the graphic novel (and slightly I agree) because it doesn't follow the story frame by frame, the themes are still pulled through.  Looking back into the graphic novel, the changes made from page to screen were dramatic, yet bold.  The \\"happy\\" ending in the film gives way to the more dismal, slightly uplifting ending in the graphic novel.  The main difference between the two is the lack of grittiness, one could call it realism, found within the story and missing in the film.  \\"V for Vendetta\\" the film is beautiful, watched in full HD, the sound, visuals, and colors are exactly the opposite from the graphic novel, and while comparing the two is not the extent of this review, it is an element that needs to be considered.  Alan Moore took his name off this film, reading the graphic novel will explain why.<br /><br />With that said, what worked and was miscalculated in the film?  To begin, the Wachowskis coupled with the direction of director James McTeigue captured the visual of \\"V\\" perfectly.  The mask was chilling, and the darkened question of his origins remained open-ended.  Their depiction of this masked vigilante was brilliant.  The way the shadows fell, the camera angles on his face instilled both fear and excitement for this character.  \\"V\\", with this film, became iconic.  Alas, the visual alone couldn't counter what preceded \\"V\\".  The use of Hugo Weaving's voice was, like Natalie Portman's accent, weak.  \\"V\\" was a bold character, but when he spoke, he seemed weaker and in less control.  Weaving's voice-work didn't capture the intensity that surrounds this character - and then there was Portman.  While she brought some innocence to the character of Eve (a name symbolic as well as poignant), the fading British accent continued the idea that she was merely Natalie Portman playing a character, not just Eve incarnate.  Stephen Rae was superb in his role, as always, as the tamed cop hunting for a belief he struggles with, and John Hurt was completely over the top, applauding his role as evil as outstanding.  These secondary characters, proving their might stronger than the primary ones, added much needed relief to this film, but it didn't make it perfect.<br /><br />\\"V for Vendetta\\" is a great film to sit down and enjoy two hours of crisp visuals, amazing music (look for a beautiful cover by \\"Cat Power\\"), and intense ideals.  It is a thinking film.  It camouflages itself as a big-budget action/adventure film, but all the while it is asking to you see the modern news and question our governments.  It will keep your mind occupied for hours.  McTeigue did a great job of bringing modern relevance (still tragic today) into this film to create a timeless sensation, but it still doesn't counter the disappointing acting.  As mentioned before, what makes \\"V for Vendetta\\" the graphic novel work is our characters, and as they lacked in the film - it moved it in a different direction.  Without the graphic novel, this film still works as entertainment, and slight thought - but it isn't a complete masterpiece.  I enjoyed this film when it was first released on the big screen, but watching it today - the small nuances with the characters just don't hold up well over time.  Its message is in tact, but lacks the body.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****brought some innocence to the character of Eve (a name symbolic as well as poignant), the fading British accent continued the idea that she was merely Natalie Portman playing a character, not just Eve incarnate.

B00280LYHS|5.0|the best book of the series. fast paced and action packed. everything comes together beautifully at the end.
0385341008|2.0|This simply written book starts out sweetly and is somewhat charmingly humorous in places. I would like to have been able to keep up with the characters and see some sort of development. Unfortunately 3/4 of the way in, the book falls completlely flat and I struggled to finish it.<br /><br />I do wish they'd written more of the romance which figures so prominantly in the end. Also,I felt the authors used this platform to cleverly educate the reader on the atrocities of WWll and the Nazi presence on Guernsey; not bad aims and quite interesting. However, they also denegrated Christianity, asking, among other things, how God could create death camps. BTW, God didn't; man did with the freedom we've all been given.  I was  taken off guard by the vile tales of the holocaust in such a lace-and-doily book; sort of like finding a cockroach in your berry pie.<br /><br />Oprah would love this book.
6303675212|1.0|Oh, the remake was horrible! John Hughes doesn't trust his audience to have the intelligence to \\"get\\" something, he has to beat you over the head with it. Examples are everywhere in the remake. The bad guys are clowns. When Santa says \\"we can't let the children down\\" Doris is all \\"Yes,,, the children...\\" because, you know, we wouldn't get that she was more concerned with her parade than the kids. Santa using sign language instead of speaking Dutch. The mom who \\"just don't get it\\" that Kris is sending people to other stores becomes some overbearing Rosie O'Donnell type harpy. And lets not forget Mara Wilson lisping her way through the role to hide the fact she can't act.     The deaf girl is typical John Hughes heavy handedness and is a good example of how this movie is a joke compared to the original. Instead of accepting that the audience would have the intelligence to \\"get\\" that Santa speaking dutch could show that he really IS Santa, Hughes has his Santa use bizarrely exaggerated sign language...and it drags out forever. You half expect hughes to jump into the scene and yell at the audience \\"SEE?!? He does SIIIGGGNNN LANGUAGE!!! He Really IS Santa!!!\\"     And good 'old Mara Wilson. Can't wait for her autobiography, \\"Lisping My Way Through Hollywood.\\" At least in the original, the little girl acted.     Horrible, horrible version.                      Out of all the remakes I've seen, this one is the worst! This movie was so horrible Macys refused to lend their name to it as to not tarnish the original classic. Dylan McDermott is no John Payne, Mara Wilson is no Natalie Wood for sure, and Attenborough is certainly no Edmund Gwenn. The chemistry between the actors in the original was like lightning captured in a jar. And that kind of lightning doesn't strike twice. You couldn't pay me to watch this!     Mara Wilson is awful in this version! Whispering and lisping all your lines is not acting in my book. There's a reason why Natalie Wood thrived in Hollywood long after she was a child star and why Mara Wilson is another has-been child star. THE REMAKE will never ever have the charm and enjoy the longevity that the original has. I won't even call the 1994 version by the title because its not deserving of it, I just refer to it as THE REMAKE. Like Maureen O'hara said \\"100 years from now people will still be looking at Miracle On 34TH Street (1947)\\" Don't think you can say the same of the 1994 movie thats the epitome of mediocrity.     The original is from a time when people made movies with quality and integrity, where there was a pride and sincerity the actors had for their roles and for the message of the movie - not the assembly line produced drivel they put out now where mostly the actors give a half-@ss performance just to collect their paycheck.       They could play THE REMAKE 24/7, 365 days a year and it would still never reach the pinnacle of classic, the only title that lousy film has earned is a place in the $5 bin at Walmart.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Wow!  This record is an eye opener.  With alot of crap coming out now days I was hesitant at first with this purchase...previously I did not care for 'Hybrid Theory' or 'Meteora'.  I have a new love for this bands music.  This band has true talent and it really shows on this record.  The songs are very well thought out and have atmospheric approah that I love.  Mr. Bennington can really sing, everything from hard metal vocals to sweet sounding ballads.  Theres not one song on this record I do not like, it amazing how they blend the keyboards with guitar riffs...***Highly recommended***

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Spoilers ahead...    Star Trek XI goes back in time to James T. Kirk's early years in Starfleet, however, what we actually get is an alternate beginning to the saga, which in effect erases a great deal of what we consider canon.  This alternate take on the Star Trek Universe is the result of the Romulan captain of a mining ship that accidently travels into the past in search of Ambassador Spock who he blames for the destruction of the Romulan Homeworld! Things take a turn for the worse when Spock is made to watch the destruction of Vulcan! These developments are definitely not for the faint hearted, especially since in the end there is no return to normalcy (as we know it).     The new cast have carried out their performances very well, with everybody seeing their characters boosted compared to the old series, though an emotional (with all its implications) Spock did not feel quite right (which is nevertheless attributed to the writers and not the actor).  Laying the foundation for a \\"new\\" and \\"younger\\" crew was a good idea though it saddens me that for the sake of money they decided to re-write Star Trek history from scratch. I am already cringing thinking about what they will erase/modify/re-write next!  However, the acting, the setting, the plot, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful and along with the non-stop action, this film will keep you on your toes from start to finish.  In short, Star Trek XI is a movie definitely worth watching as it is surely thought provoking, although it will probably produce a lot of nostalgia for the actors/crew that we have grown to know and love, and the years that have gone by. 4.5 Stars
B001ANE3EA|5.0|This is an amazing CD by, in my opinion, one of the best groups out there.  Adam Levine's songwriting is nothing less than beautiful, and this album is a testiment to that. He, himself, stated that this was the CD that defined them, the one for people to truly decide if they loved or hated Maroon 5 -- I hope with one listen, you'll love them. Every song is great, including the bonus tracks, with a DVD full of goodies to match. One of my favorite CDs of all-time.

This is much more than a run of the mill \\"coming out\\" story. It's also a story of family and devotion and the leads have a tremendous amount of chemistry together, so that their bonding and falling in love rings true.
0316286850|4.0|I love Aucoin's work and I don't think they'll ever be one like him. He shows the art in make up but he makes it simple. The pictures of the wonderful transformations is reason enough to buy this book but the tips he gives are worth the purchase as well. I love the fact that he uses everyday women in his book as well, he illustrates that a make up is not as intimidating as it seems. I also love his stories about his connections to the models. It's a very personal and warm piece, it makes it accessible to the everyday woman, it's not as cold and sterile as most make up books. Now I'm off to make some faces.
0671769227|5.0|This is of course the \\"shorter work\\"  Steven Ambrose wrote to \\"mark time\\" before beginning a longer project, but it may well end up being one of his most widely-known and most widely read.  Recounted in Ambrose's inimitable style, it is of course the main source for the popular HBO series \\"Band of Brothers\\".  Any fan of the series will want to study this volume to \\"fill in the gaps\\" and learn the background which makes clear many points the film series can only suggest.  It is immensely enjoyable reading, as are the several good published memoirs of other members of Easy Company, most notably of the main protagonist in the film, Major Dick Winters.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|While watching this video it all came back to me why I had a crush on MJ. While watching \\"I just can't stop\\" I remembered being jealous of the singer that accompanied Michael. I wanted to be her, thigh high boots and all...I'm still perplexed by my past infatuation with the man in the mirror but apparently most of the women and some of the men at the concert felt the same....wait this is a review of the concert...it's theatrical, entertaining and it proves why countless people watched this when it aired on cable. Some have said that he appears to be lip-syncing, I think this is somewhat true. I think that Michael is singing over a voice track because there are multiple times in which it appears as if he is singing live. I think that this can account for the slight echo of his voice. It's MJ and the track at the same time. Lip-syncing or not it's a darn good show, so watch it anyway.
B0013D8LOU|4.0|Not to everyone's taste - especially if you are squeamish - is this  Grand Guignol song-story of revenge, murder and the worst meat-pies in London, splashed with blood the color of Chanel lipstick and dark humor. In fact the humor is pitch black, only slightly darker than grim and grimy London in some slightly pre-Victorian age. What Tim Burton has made of it may not be quite what this revengers' tragedy was on stage and at full length. But it is original and lives up to what we have come to expect of any collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp... even if (as has been noted in other reviews) a large portion of Stephen Sondheim's literate and witty lyrical numbers were sacrificed to the demands of a movie with a running time of about half the length of the full stage production.<br /><br />The plot is whisper-thin, an urban legend or a melancholy ballad about a young man who once had a happy home, with a beautiful wife and a baby daughter. But a wicked and corrupt judge sentences him on false charges to transportation to Australia, and when he returns fifteen years later, it appears that his wife is dead, and his daughter is the ward of the judge. Set on revenge, he sets up shop as a barber in his old home, upstairs from the cheerfully larcenous Mrs. Lovett. There is a small sub-plot, regarding his daughter Joanna, kept captive by the wicked judge - and a young sailor and shipboard comrade of Sweeney Todd's - but mostly it is about Sweeney Todd's implacable quest for vengeance. The bodies pile up through-out, dumped through a trapdoor into the cellar and efficiently transformed into meat pies by Mrs. Lovett... and there you have the most of it;  almost too Edward Gorey-comical  to be a horror movie,  but almost too gory to fit into the musical comedy bracket. I would not allow pre-teens to watch this, by the way; it's fairly guaranteed to be productive of screaming nightmares for those children sensitive to video violence.<br /><br />Of the extras included on this disc, the most interesting of them was an examination of the origins of the `Sweeney Todd - Demon Barber of Fleet Street'; it appears that he was an urban legend, a creation of a writer for the most sensational 19th century  broadsheets, somewhat akin to the stories of the hook-handed man who was supposed to haunt lovers lanes in the US.most interesting of them was an examination of the origins of the `Sweeney Todd - Demon Barber of Fleet Street'; it appears that he was an urban legend, a creation of a writer for the most sensational 19th century  broadsheets, somewhat akin to the stories of the hook-handed man who was supposed to haunt lovers lanes in the US.

B000WZAE1I|4.0|\\"Stardust\\" is a slight and amusing amalgam of a movie, beautifully cast and richly garnished with comic/bizarre (or bizarrely comic) elements and props from a warehouse where bits of Victoriana are jumbled promiscuously together with bizarre inventions and devices  from Terry Gilliam's \\"Brazil\\". It has something of the same skewed fairy-tale sensibility of  \\"The Princess Bride\\", and features a plot involving (in no particular order) a captive princess under the spell of a gypsy witch, a star fallen out of the heavens, a callow young man who loves above his station, a gloriously wicked witch with a penchant for turning humans into livestock and vice versa, and a dying king whose throne will go to whoever is the last of his sons left standing after killing the others. This magical kingdom is just on the other side of  a tall stone wall from a perfectly ordinary village in rural 19th century Britain. Oh, and there is a lightening-hunting pirate ship with a captain named Shakespeare, whose swash-buckling has a distinct swish about it, since he has a not-terribly-well-concealed fondness for wearing lacy underwear. Robert DeNiro obviously had a splendid time with that character, and Michelle Pfeiffer as the endlessly inventive but constantly frustrated witch is an absolute hoot. Clair Danes shines (literally) as the fallen star, whom the initially bumbling country boy-hero Tristan (Charlie Cox) comes to realize is the one that he really loves.<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable diversion, although oriented a little more towards the adult end of the \\"suitable for family viewing\\" scale. Extras are just sufficiently lavish for fans, but not so much that they run onto another disc. \\"The Making of\\" feature, with extensive input from writer Neal Gaimon - who also seems to have had just as much fun envisioning the story and writing it... and then seeing a movie made out of his imaginings.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|It certainly says something about the power of an icon and the glitter of a golden age in movie-making that \\"Sunset Boulevard\\"  stands up so amazingly well as a bit of storytelling, in spite of its deranged silent-movie star character being parodied mercilessly by everyone from Carol Burnett on down. And curious it appears that at the time of \\"Sunset Boulevard's making, the silent-movie years were seen as something long-gone. Here was the faded star of that era, Gloria Swanson, as a deranged ghost, fluttering around the silent halls of a dilapidated mansion, and dreaming of making a comeback. The so-called `modern' Hollywood which produced a gem like \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" -- in the last days of the great studios, those dream-factories which churned out a steady stream of great movies, not-quite-so-great movies and a fair proportion of forgettable drek - that Hollywood is now just as much of a long-gone legend as the silents that came before. Gone the writers' department, the regular costumers and designers, the stagehands who worked on a cowboy movie one week and a film noir the next and a Biblical epic the day after that, the directors and actors who did pretty much the same thing, year in and year out, that Hollywood that was the background for \\"Sunset Boulevard'. They are all gone - leaving just the movie to amaze us, make us laugh uneasily, and to give us the creeps ... starting from the moment that a barely-employed, debt-ridden screenwriter, Joe Gillis, takes a turn into the wrong driveway. In the opening of the movie, he is already dead, floating face down in a swimming pool. The rest of the movie explains, with almost clinical precision, how he got that way.<br /><br />I shouldn't need to say much about the plot; the movie has been around for so long and been such a part of popular culture, but the amazing and wicked \\"in-ness\\" of it all demands comment: all those Hollywood legends, playing themselves, or something very like themselves!

B0013ND30M|5.0|One definitely has the feeling that the Disney producers of this 50th Anniversary DVD release were more than a little strapped for materiel to pad out the movie - which is as short as it is gorgeously visualized, and set to Tchaikovsky's lilting ballet music. It is the ultimate dance move; it seems as if every character, not just the two lovers are dancing, most of the time. The video itself looks quite lovely, clean and crisp, and I am sure the enhanced `surround sound\\" would have rattled the rafters, if I had the home theater sound system... er... and any rafters to rattle. Even at the length of barely over an hour, the movie enchanted the public almost as much as its creators --Walt Disney himself not the least. The castle in whose highest tower the lovely Aurora slept, waiting for true love's first kiss was being built for real even as \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was in production, to eventually become the landmark and logo for Disney's real-world amusement park properties.<br /><br />One of the extra features is a walk through of an original feature of the castle, in which park visitors peeped through keyholes, windows and doors at various scenes. This feature is long-closed, but was re-created electronically, using some of the still-extant features, which seem to have been just left in the closed up storage spaces within the Castle. There is a very long feature about the \\"Making of\\" in which a shout-out is given to just about everyone (living and dead) who had anything to do with the creation of the feature. We half-expected inclusion of the janitors who swept up and emptied out the trash baskets, since this kind of animation must have meant tons of it. There is also the usual collection of discarded story-boarded but never animated scenes, an alternate opening... and the Disney short about Grand Canyon, set to Ferdy Grofe's music. Not sure what that was doing there, maybe for the classical music element.
B001FB55HG|3.0|Even if this movie had absolutely no expectations to live up to it would still be on the lower side of mediocre, but there are expectations and this movie meets none of them. This picture was just one giant let down after another. Sub-par action sequences spliced between over-the-top drama and very poor acting. Christian Bale is actually my second favorite actor and I wasn't even impressed with him.   Certain parts are just plain unwatchable, but I can't give too much away on that. One example though, just over halfway through the movie Sam Worthington reverts to his Australian accent after having done an American one up to that point! Seriously what kind of complete idiot let that one by? Just terrible plot, terrible plot holes, and completely unbelievable occurrences.(yes it's Sci-Fi, but suspension of disbelief only goes so far)   The writers have turned Sky-Net into a bumbling Bond movie Villain who can't kill anyone. If you watch it keep in mind that Sky-Net is a super intelligent Super-Computer and you tell me if any one of it's actions make sense whatsoever. But don't waste the money if you can help it. Could have been a decent movie with a re-write and a DIFFERENT DIRECTOR, yes McG this is well over half your fault.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This CD/DVD has a serious ability to inspire collaboration and unity. The artists are truly gifted and the final product is worthy of the contributions of all the participants. The videos are essential to full appreciation of the project!
B000URDEB0|1.0|Wow this just broke my heart when I heard it. What were they thinking getting this Britney Spears wanna-be? She makes nails on a chalkboard sound good! Yeah the vocals are better on the album but have you heard her live!? Its like a hyena yelling into a microphone. Oh how I long for Tarja's emotional and powerful voice to once again echo through my stereo accompanied by Nightwish. This is quite a downfall for one of the most amazing bands out there. Annette needs to be silenced!
0345345061|4.0|I had hoped for more with this book but I bought it with a particular essay in mind for school work.  However, for hardcore Tolkein fan, this is a great treasure trove of essays, short stories, etc.
6300184080|4.0|I purchased this for a friend and she really liked this movie.I saw the movie when it first aired on tv and I thought it was great.I enjoy most of the movies Cher was in but this is one of my favorites.I especially like Sam Elliott.
B001QB9H1A|3.0|If you watch the special features, you'll find that they made this movie on a tight schedule and it looks like it. The bad guy was way too charming - not bad enough at all. The girl was such a loser. There weren't enough scenes with the French cop. Lots of special effects, but not enough of an interesting story line. Transporter 2 is still the BEST!
B000FVQYYK|4.0|Black Holes and Revelations  being Muse's 4th studio album and their 2006 release was yet another album that I picked up at my local library by chance and I was very pleasantly and it sounds a bit like a mix between new wave and the Cure.  The album was well received by the critics and peaked at #1 in the UK, Australia and Switzerland. They released 5 singles from the album. These being, \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\", \\"Starlight\\", \\"Knights of Cydonia\\", \\"Invincible\\" and \\"Map of problematique\\". The booklet has all the lyrics and some nice photographs. 4/5.
B0002MRPDQ|5.0|This great western, with three great leads in the title roles, was made even greater with the best original movie score ever to ride out of the west!  Written by Ennio Morricone, this is music you can love without even having seen the movie!  It stands alone, like listening to a great orchestral work by Mozart or Beethoven.  But seen and heard together, the movie and the music very effectively tell the story.  If you have seen the movie, listening to the score dramatically brings back the action.
0440295262|5.0|First let me state, the book was received in excellent condition.  I found the book, moving, sensitive, and compelling.  This boy had the integrity, wiseness and strength and empathy that's rare to find in a grown man. Susan Sarandon's character in the book ( I saw the movie first, and it was that which was so excellent, it made me want to read the novel). was such a strong, and courageous woman, fighting so many demons, you could not help but find her most admirable.  I haven't completed the book as yet, but I have been looking for a compass,  so I shall never lose my way, as I can easily identify with her.  In a way, I just don't want the, book to end.
1400032717|2.0|I was quite disappointed by this highly touted book about an autistic boy/ teenager.  In my opinion he seems  more  like an Asperger's syndrome person than an autistic person.  Most autistic young people would not be as highly functioning, while an Asperger person certainly could be.  Asperger's  persons are much more connected and highly functioning in the normal, average world.  Because insight into the world of Autism/ Asperger's is rarely written about or discussed outside that world...if you don't count the movie \\"Rain Man\\"....this book therefore  got  a lot of publicity and became an immediate bestseller.  However, unlike the image shown in \\"Rainman\\", the film, MOST autistic and Asperger people do not have \\"savant\\" characteristics, that is, the genius abilities that Dustin Hoffman's character in \\"Rainman\\" had. (The story is fictional, but the person Hoffman based his character on is an autistic man who is an autistic savant, and can do the unusual things with mathematics that Hoffmann's character in the film could do.)<br /> The young man in this novel also has math abilities, as well as being able to write, which leads me to think of him as more of an Asperger's syndrome person.  I have four friends with autistic or asperger's sons and my sense (as a non-expert) is that this was a \\"clever idea\\" for a book, but very unrealistic.  The author in interviews has stated he has no autistic syndrome relatives and no background in, for example, teaching or caring for autistic/asperger persons.  The idea of the book is creative and it's a quick read, but to me it comes across as a clever \\"trick\\" type of novel, well written, clever, but not believable.
B000002JKA|5.0|As the second DT disc with James LaBrie at the microphone, this was the perfect continuation to Images and Words.  The only downside was that the keyboards sounded a little stale and under-inspired.  On wonder...with Kevin Moore leaving as he did.  The rest of the band's contributions were supurb.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|The collaborative, worldwide effort that went into the making of this CD and DVD is impressive. The selections are masterfully arranged and performed by incredibly talented individuals and groups, who, for the most part, are unknown but deserving of acclaim. Their stories are in their faces on the DVD, which tugs at the heart strings as it uplifts and inspires. The music is timeless, the delivery priceless. Give yourself, your friends, and your family this phenomenal gift of hope and joy as you help spread the message of peace.
B000009QOC|5.0|Danzig was always a unique band. Blending one part Black Sabbath with vocals that were reminiscent of both Jim Morrison and Elvis Presley and with a lyrical fixation that reminded one of Black Metal, this was one strange, Doom Metal act.    There debut is considered a classic in many areas. I thought it was certainly good, but it never fully rose above a garage level quality for me, playing like Sabbath but not fully finding it's own sound. If anything that's exactly what happens here. This is the band fully coming to grips with there sound and finding themselves and offering there most heaviest offering yet.    The album features a nice mixture of Gothic melody and heavy Doom, with a sprinkling of dark balladry.    Stand outs are the crushing opener, \\"Long Way Back From Hell\\", with it's dark almost Metal meets Johnny Cash kind of vibe. The \\"Twist of Cain\\" like \\"Snakes of Christ\\" an evil little ditty with a nice mixture of soft vocals and a raging chorus. \\"Killer Wolf' and \\"Pain in the World\\" follow suit.  \\"Devil's Plaything\\" is a sexy, evil classic that ranks among the band's all time classics. Sounds a little like Type O Negative, here. \\"Girl\\" feels like a lost Sabbath track with sixties love lyrics gone Goth and that ballad, \\"Blood and Tears\\", a track teetering on Honky Tonk and Blues, is actually one of the most dark and well written on this album.(Glenn's vocals on that one....lord save me).    The best track on here(and personal favorite of the catalouge) may very well belong to the Goth-heaviness of the chugging pace of \\"Her Black Wings\\" about Danzig's love with a Demoness from hell. Awesome soloing and a killer riff highlight this most unique of Goth Metal tracks.    An absolute essential of a band at the peak of it's powers, which unfortunately will only last so well for two more albums before changing there sound to a more, less original Industrial sound. It's a shame because it's hard to not get excited about this most dark of Metal acts based around these first four albums, especially this, the heaviest of the lot.   Crucial to any Goth-Metallers collection.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|I was excited to find this Gary, it seems he's harder to find than Spongebob.  It is so cute and the perfect size for small hands.
B000001FN1|5.0|A true classic of the late 80s Metal scene is this Power Metal release, the last of four amazing albums from Germany's Warlock. The band was basically Accept with a sexy female vocalist. It was a good simple formula and Doro Pesch's vocals were unique and strangely soulful, while remaining committed to Metal. The heaviness was hardly compromised and this may be the most succesful Metal act with a Female vocalist ever.    The songs are all classics, but leading the pack is the album's opener and the band's most beloved track that being the insanely anthemic, \\"All We Are\\". The lyrics to this one don't really make alot of sense, but it's one of the most singable and fun Metal recordings ever. The track is firmly established among the list of great Hard Rock/Metal anthems.    \\"I Rule the Ruins' is probally my personal favorite Warlock song with a commanding Halford like dominance by Doro in a song about a destroyed relationship that could find itself repaired. The riff by lead guitarist, \\"T.Bolan\\" is a classic and this ranks as much a fistpumper as an emotional epic.    Other classics include Metallic speedsters like \\"Three Minute Warning\\"(complete with Doro making some cute noise on the mic in the beginning), the heavy \\"Kiss of Death\\", and the melodic, \\" East Meets West\\".  The album closes with the masterful balladry of \\"Fur Immer\\", which features one of Ms. Pesch's most passionate vocal performances, singing in both German and English.    This is a thoroughly delightful Metal album that all serious students of the genre should have in his/her collection. That especially rings true if you enjoy Accept and the vintage Metal sound of the 80s. I'd reccomend the other three Warlock albums as well, but this is the one to own. A classic all the way.  Doro still rules the ruins.    Cover Art:I love this cover. Totally awesome painting depicting a Warlock/Demon Guy feeling up Doro Pesch on the cover, who's looking typically sexy in tight black leather and showing alot of skin.I love where the Demon dude's hands ended up! Ha! Totally sets up the mood of this album perfectly.  Special Note: One of my fifty favorite albums of all time.
0321334876|5.0|This is an amazing book. I read it long ago and am reading it again. My development team are all young. I decided to read this book as a team to help bring the java trained people up to speed on the complexities of C++. It is working well so far. The format of the book lends itself to \\"book club\\" style reading like no other.
0385508476|4.0|This is all together a strange book. It contains what survives Anne's original diary (minus just over 100 words removed on request) as well as her short stories and other writings, her own rewrites and the 1951 Barbara Mooyaart-Doubleday English translation. This in itself is a failing of a scholarly endeavour as Mrs. Mooyaart-Doubleday did not work from the original documents.<br /><br />The vocabulary used throughout is British English and the spelling American English; this is somewhat confusing. The book is also riddled with many typographical errors.<br /><br />However, this book is stunning in the depth of its analysis and the breadth of its research. It covers the history of the Frank and H&ouml;llander families; the arrest, betrayal and deportation; the play and attacks on the authenticity of the diary. It covers the document examination and handwriting identification analysis.<br /><br />The original diary writings give a better idea of the development of Anne as a writer, of the hopes and disappointments of being in hiding and the blossoming of sexuality. The other articles give context to Anne's situation.<br /><br />In all, it's a fascinating work for people interested in the Anne Frank story although probably too technical and detailed to be of interest to the general reader.
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|The Nerf Longshot CS-6 is pretty good quality but sometimes the darts get jammed up.  I like that it can be upgraded with the scope and has an extra ammunition mag.  It is a 2 in 1 blaster and has good accuracy.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|Diana has done it again...although I must admit her voice sounded a bit strange in a couple of her songs.  It's almost like she went a little overboard on her sultryness, but still a very excellent CD and very romantic, and easy on the ears. She still is one of my favorite singers!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Although the early episodes are painfully funny (bad acting, Spock always seeming showing emotions and seeming miffed at something or another, the obviously plastic pipes on the walls of the ship, constant death of no-name crewmen, etc.), the computer-enhanced special effects and re-done soundtrack brings this classic series into the \\"modern age\\". :)
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I can't add anything useful to the lavish praise in hundreds of 5-star reviews.   Just adding this as a 5-star vote from someone not in the intended demographic - over 60
B0000062GE|3.0|I bought this CD based on listening to Wither Blister Burn, which despite the blatant Nine Inch Nails sounds and overall NINishness, the album is very good!  I also bought this CD based on some of the reviews on Amazon.  One reviewer said it was the best album he's ever listened to.  Another review said this was a depressing, melancholic album.  After a brief first listen, I can say one of the songs sounds like Smashing Pumpkins, another song sounds like a Killing Joke guitar riff, and then another songs is eerily reminiscent of Rage Against the Machine.  These guys need err ... needed (I guess the band dissolved) a voice of their own.  And the review about the songs sounding morose, melancholic, sad, depressing - I didn't hear it.  You want depressing, listen to the Cure's Pornography album.  In any event, maybe this album needs a couple listens, but my first impression is not all that favorable despite a few songs that seemed ok, nothing mind blowing.  I thought the Wither Blister album was significantly better.  YMMV.

No but seriously everything he does is new and fresh, from the magic system to the dangers, to the character development. If i had to pick a video to describe it would be this video. It pretty much sums up the feeling of the book. Enjoy! [...]
B0020M99LC|4.0|Awesome stunt work @ start! Near 4 star technically good movie, a bit soggy at the end romance wise with an explanation and no spikes in overall enjoyment. Thus a less than four, still a four star movie , could be possibly a +four due to the Stunts! Rent it, you won't be unhappy, but the movie is (too?) polished, no extreme wows! or sniffs............

B001GZ6QC4|1.0|94% positive reviews at Rotten Tomatoes.<br />Over 1 billion $ at the box office.<br />8.9/10 rating at IMDB.<br /><br />Remembering Batman Begins I was thinking that Nolan must have done an excellent job once again.<br /><br />For some unexplained reason (instict?) I waited to see this on DVD. And I was right. From the beginning of the film I had the feeling \\"something is wrong\\" but I ignored it. I knew it was long so I waited. But minutes passed, more minutes passed and the film wasn't getting anywhere. After I saw it, I understood why some users on IMDB rated this supposedly great movie with only one star (and quite a lot of people agreed with their comments).<br /><br />Except for Ledger, there is nothing good in this movie. It's not even close to Begins. Hard to believe it's from the same director. There is simply no action, no darkness, no Gotham, laughable fight scenes, even the Bat-suit (especially the cape) is crap! Can you imagine that there is a scene where dogs chew through the suit and injure Batman ?? What rubbish. I'm still wondering what was the plot (if there was any).<br /><br />I don't want to say much, this was simply a boring, empty, overhyped film for sure. 'Begins' was definitely on the right track but this feels it fell off a cliff. Maybe next time...
B001FB4W0W|5.0|It is quite delicious! I loved every minute of the show. Sookie is amazing. She could be my sister! Bill is such a gentleman. He could be my brother! Sam is so cute and friendly he could be my best guy friend! Eric is so beautiful, tall, and slender built, he could be my former husband! ha! Pam would surely be my BFF.    I have watched the series so many times, I fall asleep watching it. My husband gets tired of turning it off in the middle of the night.    My best part: Sookie went to the grave yard to put flowers on Bill's grave and walking back a hand quickly grabs her ankle and begins to pull her. I screamed! My husband thought something happened, but I never said a word nor him because the love making was so intense I could not take my eyes off of it. I have not seen a part like that one before.    As for the books, I have read everyone including the new one. They just keep getting better and better! Each book is full of suspense, drama, humor, etc....etc...they are great!    Never a dull moment in TrueBlood and the reading books!    JWright
0743583256|3.0|I bought it as a gift and have not had a chance to listen to it.
0312370849|2.0|I had never heard of the Paris round up, and found that part of the story compelling and well executed.  The present day story of Julia and her problems just didn't hang together for me.  I could never figure out why she would care so much what happened to Sarah -- but must confess that the notion of taking generational guilt to the personal level has never made much sense to me.  I feel terrible about, for example, the internment of the Japanese during WWII, and agree that compensation should be paid, but I don't feel any personal guilt or remorse about it, and just don't get why Julia took the story of Sarah and Michel so personally.<br /><br />Certainly, any Holocaust story well told is soul sickening, but I simply could not identify with Julia's motivations.  It would have made more sense if it had been told from the standpoint of an actual participant in the events like Julia's mother or father in law, or perhaps a third person narrator.<br /><br />Having said that, it is worth a read if only to learn about an historical event that has escaped much press.
B00005O3VC|5.0|You know, I would've loved to have been in the audience when Monty Python and the Holy Grail was first shown. I'm picturing a fair amount of laughter, but also quite a bit of confusion and critics saying, \\"What the hell did I just see?\\" That was certainly the case when Roger Ebert reviewed the first Monty Python movie, And Now For Something Completely Different. He seemed very interested in the audience reaction during his review, and I imagine the audience reaction during the first screenings for this film would've been similar.<br /><br />Of course, by the time Monty Python and the Holy Grail came out in 1976, the original series had been airing on PBS for a couple years, so people were more familiar with the show. But still. Just imagine what reactions must've been like for those poor souls who went into this movie never having seen the TV program.<br /><br />I don't need to tell most of you about the plot to this film. King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table go off to find the Holy Grail. Most of the major knights from the stories are here, though Guinevere and Merlin are strangely absent (though there is an enchanter named Tim). The film also adds the rather cowardly Sir Robin and the aptly-named Sir Not Appearing in this Film.<br /><br />The movie itself is a fascinating hodge-podge of hilarity. You get to see several film genres, including swashbucklers, fantasy, epics and musicals, all get joyfully skewered. One cost-saving move, using coconuts banged together to simulate the sound of horses, since they couldn't actually afford horses, is an inspired notion. Despite that, much of the film shows the time period in a more realistic fashion than most other movies. There's lots of dirt and lots of mud and people know the king is the king because \\"He hasn't got [...] all over him.\\"<br /><br />Everyone who has seen the movie has their favorite moments. For me it's probably a toss up between the \\"Spamalot\\" song, the Holy Hand Grenade, and the \\"Help, help! I'm being repressed!\\" scene. The events at Castle Anthrax is a close follow-up, but really the whole movie works and works well. There's not a bad moment in the film, not a joke that falls flat.<br /><br />This movie, like all great films, has left behind a huge legacy, though not in the way some might think. Often times it's a legacy that filmmakers try to avoid. For example, in the the commentary on The Lord of the Rings films you will frequently hear Peter Jackson somewhat humoursly lament how hard they tried to avoid giving their movies a Holy Grail feeling. Of course the movie also lead to the hit Broadway musical, Spamalot, which I've never seen, but heard great things about.<br /><br />This movie isn't for everyone, of course. There's always a few humourless louts out there who won't enjoy it. Us normal folk know better, however, and we can enjoy it for the wonderful, creative, hilarious film it is!

0192840711|5.0|Michael Henchard, a 21-year-old itinerant farmhand, enters a refreshment tent with his wife and baby girl at a country fair. Depressed by his poverty, Henchard gets blind drunk. He'd get along so much better without the burden of a family, he declares to one and all - and he offers his wife for sale to the highest bidder.<br /><br />Am amiable sailor throws down five guineas, and Susan Henchard, babe in arms, goes off with him.<br /><br />Amazingly, such things did happen in nineteenth-century rural England. This shocking event is our introduction to Michael Henchard's tempestuous character.<br /><br />Once sober, Henchard searches high and low for his wife and child, but with no success. He makes a vow in church to abstain from alcohol for the next 21 years, and he keeps that vow.<br /><br />We encounter Henchard two decades later, now a prosperous corn and wheat merchant and the Mayor of Casterbridge.<br /><br />Character is fate. Henchard's nature, violent and remorseful, jealous and generous by turns, will give him no rest in this life. We can't help pitying the man, deeply flawed though he is.<br /><br />The Mayor of Casterbridge is a classic of English literature. It's also a totally gripping story, abounding in reversals, romances and local color.  Don't start reading it on a night that you hope to get to bed early!
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Leave it to JJ Abrams to be the person to successfully restart the Star Trek franchise, and at the theaters, no less! \\"Star Trek\\" is a lot of things - it's a great summer movie, fun, funny, exciting, interesting, but above all else, it's a reimagining of the classic 60s television series that turned into a cult-phenomenon spawning endless reruns, four more television series, cartoons, a movie franchise, and lots of merchandise.<br /><br />In the hands of the talented Abrams, an inventive scripts, and great performances, this film goes back to the very beginning and shows how James T. Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy, Montgomery Scott, Chekov, and Sulu first crossed paths during the maiden voyage of the starship Enterprise. Add Eric Bana as a time-traveling, vengeance-seeking Romulan and a cameo by Leonard Nimoy as an older version of Spock, and you have a film that was cannily contructed to appeal to non-Trekkies and Trekkies alike.
031606792X|5.0|I almost didn't read this one based on all the negative reviews. I'm glad that I decided to get it anyway and make my own opinion. I got this yesterday afternoon and finished it tonight. It was 750 pages, but went by very fast for me. Everything that happened (marriage, intimacy, baby, Bella changing and her powers, Jacob*) worked to me, and didn't seem tied up in a bow or worked out too fast without any grief or barriers that other people have alluded to. *I don't think any of these are giving anything away for anyone reading the reviews, anyhow.*<br /><br />I don't know if Stephanie Meyers is going to write any more on this world (besides any that she's already mentioned) but it gives precedence to a lot of stories that she could turn out from this if she chooses to. How the baby grows up, for example, or what happens with Jacob, for instance.<br /><br />I just don't think that anyone should ignore this final book, or not read it just because of any negative reviews. If you don't want to buy it, get it from the library or borrow from a friend. Make up your own mind on what you feel about it.<br /><br />There are negative reviews and positive reviews. I liked it, so here's another addition to the positive list.
0385341008|5.0|I read this book only because I was spending a day with a friend floating in her pool, didn't want to take my Kindle in the water, and it was sitting on the table by the door.<br /><br />Going in, I had the following attitudes:<br /><br />1.  I dislike epistolary novels.<br /><br />2.  A Guernsey is a type of cow found in bucolic pastoral settings, not a place.<br /><br />3. There is nothing new that can be written about the Holocaust that could move me.<br /><br />As a caveat in my defense with respect to item 3., I have read, and in many cases re-read scores of books over the years about the Holocaust.<br /><br />As it turns out, I was wrong on all counts.  I marvel at the skill required to bring this story to such vivid, heart wrenching, joyous life.<br /><br />Like many voracious readers, I am a frustrated novelist and am positively seething with envy at what these authors were able to create first time out of the box.  In a word, excellent.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|Watchmen, the film based on the novel of the same name, is one hell of a movie.<br /><br />The film, like the book, tells the story of a super-hero world where there's only one that's super and not that many that are heroic. It's an alternate 1985, where America won the Vietnam War thanks to Doctor Manhattan, the only one of the Watchmen with super powers, and where Richard Nixon was elected to a fifth term. Vigilantes are banned, but that doesn't stop the disturbed, and disturbing, Rorschach, a masked crusader who read Ayn Rand and didn't get the joke.<br /><br />The movie begins with the murder of the Comedian, a former masked hero and US government operative. Rorshach begins investigating that and quickly starts to think there's more than meets the eye, and that someone's out to get the former heroes. Along with his only friend, Nite Owl II, he starts uncovering what might be the largest conspiracy ever.<br /><br />The film is a visual feast of immense proportions (rather like Doctor Manhattan's penis, which you'll see more of than you wanted). The sights up on the screen, particularly on Mars, are stunning, and the effects are nearly perfect, even the most mundane ones. There's a couple shots that I would've sworn were filmed in New York City (the movie was shot in Vancouver).<br /><br />The acting is just as good, especially by Jackie Earle Haley was Rorschach. He's got the voice and the manerisms down pat from the comic. The other roles are rounded out just as well, even those that are people impersonating real historical figures (though Nixon's nose was way too long).<br /><br />As for the script, it was quite good, and though, yes, the ending is changed from the graphic novel, it keeps the overall theme intact and, frankly, works better than the giant squid thingy.<br /><br />Overall this was a very good movie, though not for everyone. Do yourself a favor and go see it while it is still in theatres, cause it will suffer greatly on the small screen.
1439157383|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is a well written book. Once you start reading it you won't want to put it down! All of the medical words in this book are correct. She really did her research in writing her book. I can't wait for the movie to come out! I wish more people would read this book!
B001KP2Y3K|4.0|\\"Bare Bones\\" is Madeleine Peyroux's first attempt at recording \\"modern\\" music, which for her means a non-Billie Holliday sounding, non-traditional jazz sound where she has written or co-written all 11 songs on the record.<br /><br />Her voice still sounds like Holliday's, but the songs on this record, while similar to previous Ms. Peyroux's recordings about love, loss, and modern living sounds like early 21st century life as opposed to early to mid 20th century life. And though her voice has previous sounded like it should only sings old jazz standards, Ms. Peyroux proves that she has the talent, both vocally and in her songwriting to be considered not only a classic artist, but a contemporary one.
0060935464|5.0|I know I must have read this book during my teenage years but, for some reason, couldn't remember its details.  So, to read it again (possibly) in middle age was an absolute revelation.  What a wonderful book.  What a totally captivating story.<br /><br />Set in semi-rural Alabama in the years following the Great Depression, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" covers the events of a small town and some of its underlying tensions.  These are largely of a racial nature where poor and scarcely literate whites seem to have an innate hatred of blacks.  Thus, we see the trial of Tom Robinson, an honest but poor black man, who is unfairly convicted of the rape of Mayella Ewell, the eldest daughter of a family of white trash.  This is a sad case of bad triumphing over good.<br /><br />However, the story has more to offer.  Some degree of justice does prevail in the end.  Yet, the book is more than a linear plot.  It tells the story of the town brilliantly.  The reader is entranced by the characters.  We can see the wisdom of Atticus Finch, the town's lawyer; the violent ignorance of Bob Ewell, the father of Mayella; and the natural curiosity of Jem and Scout, the two children of Atticus.  In every sense, these characters are absolutely plausible.  Indeed, they are real.  The reader thus feels as though he or she is a voyeur to real events.  Harper Lee as the author has done a terrific job.  As the work of a first time author, Lee deserves accolades of the highest order.<br /><br />To read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a privilege.  It is English literature at its best.  I feel that I am a richer person for the experience.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out 20 years ago. It is the best western I have seen. Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones were a perfect match in this movie. It wouldn't be the same without them. It has it all. Romance,drama,learning about life comedy and heart ache.
B00288KNL8|4.0|Coraline, the latest adaptation of a work by Neil Gaiman, has hit theatres. It tells the story of young girl who, along with her rather oblivious parents, has just recently moved to the Pink Palace Apartments in what appears to be Ashland, Oregon. She feels stifled and doesn't like the place, especially after she meets weird local boy Wybie.    Her life becomes rather more interesting when she finds a portal to another world (climbing through something rather similar to a big, blue-purple vagina. I'm not judging, just reporting), where she meets her Other Mother and Other Father, both idealized versions of her parents with buttons for eyes. They lavish love and attention upon her and don't appear to want anything in return. Well, possibly her eyes.    This is a weird little stop-motion animated movie with some of the best, most amazing visuals I've seen on film in a long time. One of the things I love about movies is their abilities to show me things I've never seen and on that level this film doesn't disappoint. The mouse circus alone is worth the price of admission. It's also got a good, if rather basic, plot and some great voice acting.    The film has a brisk pace, and at no point was I looking at my watch, wondering when it would end. The sheer creativeness of what I was seeing up on the screen was enough to distract me from the few plot holes, though I did notice a couple points where it seemed like scenes were missing.    But there was something kind of off about the film. I don't know what it was. It certainly felt somewhat incomplete, and the third act felt kind of rushed (basically, \\"Go off on a quest!\\" followed a few moments later by, \\"Right, quest done!\\"). Despite that, it was a decent movie and I didn't feel my money was wasted, which is always a plus.    One word of caution about the film. I would be careful on taking young kids to see it. There's some rather dark images here (like a few attempts at removing eyes), that might give kids some rather unhappy dreams. I'd not take anyone under about 8 or so without seeing it first to screen it.    Also, I can't speak to the 3-D effects, since my theatre didn't show it in 3-D. I could tell where there were clearly moments that were supposed to be 3-D but weren't. I've a feeling it probably didn't add anything to the movie to see it in 3-D, though.    So if you want a good time at a film where you'll see things you've never seen before, go to this. If you don't want that, hey, there's always Benjamin Button. At least you'll keep in the buttons theme.
0312427646|5.0|This is one of my very favourite books. First, it's a book about books and the joys of reading. Second, I'm a huge fan of the novella form. Third, it's smart and witty and endearing. I've read this a couple of times (and listened to Mr Bennett read it too).<br /><br />From the moment those dogs wander away and \\"One\\" follows them to the book mobile, I knew I was in for a rare treat. I couldn't believe that she asked Norman if he knew Cecil Beaton. Talking about David Hockney and J. R. Ackerley and the Mitfords - all works and artists I'm familiar with.<br /><br />The fact that Norman, a young gay man, is self-educating by reading books by and about other gay people is too ironic not to appreciate as I facilitate an LGBT book group with the same focus. Norman actually reminds me of me. I made that same trek through \\"gay\\" literature (it's an on-going trek). That he recommends these volumes to The Queen because they're basically the only books he knows is simply priceless.  Perhaps that identification is one reason I cherish this novella so much.  I also admire Bennett's wit and have read quite a number of the books and authors mentioned in this text.<br /><br />I've read quite a bit of Bennett and seen a number of the films based on his stage work - A Private Function, The Madness of George III, The History Boys, The Lady in the Van, The Laying On of Hands: Stories and especially A Life Like Other People's - and I'm a huge fan of Beyond the Fringe (I've got a great DVD of the group). So, what I'm trying to say is that I came to this prepared to like it - and I did. I found it witty and amusing. I kept casting the film version in my mind - Imelda Staunton or Julie Walters.<br /><br />I'm not going to go on - not now. I don't want to give too much away. Please, please, please, read and enjoy.
0316010669|1.0|If you want to be enlightened or entertained by this book like I did, you will be sadly disappointed. According to Malcolm, we must strive to rid ourselves of the horrible limiting stereotypes we have of African Americans and females, etc. However, while it is important that we do that, it is still okay to stereotype individuals experiencing Autism. In fact, he shares a few based on one study with one individual experiencing autism and expects the reader to be as ignorant of the subject as he is.
0143038419|5.0|Some other reviewers did not like the writer's voice in this book, calling her narcissistic and saying there was no meaning. I had the opposite reaction. I loved the complete candor, the humor, the struggle, the journey, the wonderment, the voice.  I found the whole journey to be inspiring and I felt like a girlfriend in on a tale told by a good friend. To me it's an example of the unfolding that happens when someone allows themselves to be themselves and follow their inner voice. That's biggest lesson here. Bravo.  I also took away something from reading about the author's meditation practice.  She spoke to her mind like a little child, telling it to be still while she listened to God. One of many examples of how a creative person finds their way to peace.  I'll probably read this one again sometime.
B001VB8UAE|4.0|If you're a fan...no more needs to be said.  She's in really good voice.  Clearer than it was in her first set of concerts.  And she performs most of her classics with their original arrangements.  Barbra seems more relaxed on stage than ever...at one point playing the piano, screwing it up and laughing about it.    Definately worth having!
1400063515|5.0|Remember a few years ago when some REITs promoted the idea that the REITs had a near-zero correlation with most other investments?  Then, during this latest financial crisis, all investments had a correlation of nearly 1?  To fully value Nassim Nicholas Taleb's THE BLACK SWAN: THE IMPACT OF THE HIGHLY IMPROBABLE, I encourage everyone to read this along with Satyajit Das' TRADERS, GUNS, & MONEY & Derman's MY LIFE AS A QUANT.  For example, on page 165 of TRADERS, Das lists 15 Black Swan events between 1987 & 2005 alternated with \\"normal market\\" conditions.  How to prepare yourself for Black Swan events?  The strategy Taleb recommends is \\"to tinker as much as possible\\" & \\"take the exceptional as a starting point\\" while \\"treating the ordinary as subordinate\\".  You have to read all these books to flesh out these generalizations.  More specifically, start with Taleb's Decision-making rule which incorporates El-Erian's advice in WHEN MARKETS COLLIDE to buy cherries.  Quoting Taleb, \\"In the end it is those who derive consequences . . . who win the day.\\"

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|I am a constant fan of of Pixar, have been since their breakout hit Toy Story all the way back in 1995 when i was only 14 years old.  I've grown up with these films, and I've never missed one in theaters.  I have always been amazed at how fantastic the animation in all their films are, and how heartwarming they are as well.      I will admit that in the past few years I've been somewhat disappointed with the fair coming from Pixar, I was not a fan of Cars or Ratatouille and all though it was a FANTASTIC action film I felt that The Incredibles missed the mark somehow, but last year with the release of the phenomenal Wall*e, they once again proved that they have what it takes to make a good film.  Not to say that the above mentioned were not good, in fact just the opposite. I loved all of them, it was just that with the likes of Toy Story 2, Monster's Inc, and the pitch perfect Finding Nemo under their belt the aformentioned three seemed a bit less than.      And now with UP, Pixar proves that their \\"less than\\" era is good and gone. UP tells the story of Carl Fredrickson a 78 year old retired balloon salesman, whom after the death of his beloved wife Ellie finds himself lost and desperately alone.  With the BIG city doing it's best to crush his tiny world in on him and label him a menace by forcing him out of his home; all he has left of his life with Ellie, he hatches a plan to take himself and his home to South America to Paradise Falls to make his and Ellie's dream of visiting there come true.      You'd think all would go as planned, and to begin it does. Then Carl finds himself stuck with young Russell, a stowaway cub scout on his hot air home.  Together they find themselves on an adventure much different than they had thought.  Enter a group of talking dogs. On one end of  the group the  goofy and lovable Dug, at the other the creepy and menacing Alpha...well, except the voice. (see the film and you'll catch my drift) Add a giant flightless bird that Russell names Kevin, and throw Carls childhood adventuring hero into the mix and you have a fantastic and at times suspenseful adventure.      The animation, once again is top notch, I was not able to see it in 3D so I'm not able to give a heads up on how it is in 3D, but it looks fantastic in 2D just the same.  The balloons that Carl attaches to his house look so real, and in wider shots showing the whole of the floating house the balloons have lives of their own.  I would love to know what kind of program they used to give each balloon it's own individual trajectory.  The character animation looks fantastic particularly on Kevin and the dogs.  Kevin looks like a real bird and moves like one as well, \\"it's\\" fluid movements and birdlike qualities suck you in and make you believe \\"it's\\" truly there.  The dogs, mostly pitbulls, dobberman pincher's, rottweillers, and a few labs, look awesome as well.  They are given a slight cartoonish flair; but for the most part look and move and even act like real dogs.  Dug, is a wonder of animation, his movement's are so lifelike even more so than the rest of the pack of dogs.  When he is punished and tucks his tail and lowers his head it looks like a real dog! Carl, Russell, Ellie and Muntz look fantastic as well; each with their own shape and animation quarks.  Carl with his Cary Grant face and golf balled walker, Russell with his yellow scout suit and HUGE backpack, Ellie with her beautiful smile and expressive eyes and Muntz; well watch the movie to find out about who he is and what he's like.  And the landscapes are fantastic! The rainforest type areas are astonishing to look at, as are the city scapes and even the barren rock structures.      The music is fantastic as well, it's simple, whimsical and filled with a sweetness that conveys what the film is about, adventure and love.  From the sad, emotional parts to the funny parts, to the fast paced action, and creepy suspenseful parts, the music flows with the film.  It does what the background music should do, be in the background.  It makes each moment all the more wonderful.    But, the thing that I love most about the film; is it's heart.  The first 15 minutes of the film showing Carl's meeting Ellie and their marriage and life together is done so wonderfully. It has no vocals, just a beautiful and whimsical tune to take you on their life journey. My father passed away a few years ago, so my mother was very touched by this sequence; the way they focused on Carl and Ellie just sitting and holding hands, or Carl dusting and glimpsing her and stopping to just stare at what he has been blest with.  I'm giving nothing away when I say that when Ellie dies my mother and I both were close to tears.  It's this emotional resonance that makes this film so amazing.  Ellie is in the film physically all of 15 minutes but her presence and spirit dominate the film more so than any other character in it.  UP truly is a love story, pure and simple.  It's all so a story about finding your place in new and unwanted circumstances, and finding something inside yourself you thought was not there.  It is a fantastic and beautiful film in every way.    For parents.  There are a few sequences that may frighten smaller children, the large pack of dogs are a bit creepy early on in the film, as are a few other scenes with said dogs.  Also a few other scenes of peril may have them asking questions of \\"why is so and so doing so and so?\\"  For slightly older kids there are elements of death, divorce and abandonment in the film as well that may have your children wondering, so be ready for questions. I still feel that the film is fine for all kids 1 to 100!
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|AAA+++Don't read this book in church or library!! It is too funny for quiet places. OMG, what a life! He clearly had a strange upbringing and survived that and became his own man somehow. I found his stories to be so interesting and never knew where they were leading. This book was more different than any I had ever read. \\"The lady on the plane\\" story was hilarious. Good job altogether.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Tommy Garrett wrote the following review for \\"Australia\\" in Canyon News, Beverly Hills paper last fall.  Film  \\"Australia\\" - The Big Screen Version  By Tommy Garrett, Editor, Canyon News  Nov 30, 2008 - 8:36:32 PM    When genius, but very independent, film director Baz Luhrmann goes to work, you know that you will be seeing an epic. \\"Moulin Rouge\\" comes to mind. But like \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" his latest epic, \\"Australia,\\" is saddled with debt for FOX Studios and the shooting of three endings, one of which was reportedly so hard for the test audiences that they had to change the ending. This is rarely done in Hollywood anymore. But after spending nearly $150 million on this film, FOX and Luhrmann both are desperate for a hit. It comes out at a time that is beneficial for movie audiences. Of course it'll be a hit in Australia itself. Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, both Aussie natives, have been down under promoting and praising the great film and also the Australians are anxious to see a film that paints their history on the world stage for a change. Aussies have an incredible history just as America. Like America, they get lost in many epic film stories in Europe and Asia. There are countless stories of The Holy Wars of Europe, the Persian Empire and even Alexander the Great. But this is Australia's first time leading the pack in the storytelling of their own history, independent of Great Britain and any other nation.    Kidman is good in her role, but Hugh Jackman is the heart and soul of the film. It almost seemed as though it was not expected or planned, but Jackman brilliantly downplays many scenes and comes off the victor in the film when it comes to showcasing talent. This may be the film that revives Kidman's career, but it is the film that reminds movie goers that Jackman is not only the sexiest man alive, says People Magazine, but one of the most underrated actors of his generation. It's hard to get a headline when you have giants like Will Smith, Brad Pitt, Russell Crowe and Tom Cruise. But Hugh Jackman proves an old adage that Spencer Tracy once remarked. \\"You should not play a role, you should live it.\\" Jackman may not have been trained by the greats like Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy and Laurence Olivier, but he surely channels them in his acting ability.     FOX Studios official release states, \\"In northern Australia prior to World War II, an English aristocrat inherits a cattle station the size of the U.S. State of Maryland. When English cattle barons plot to take her land, she reluctantly joins forces with a rough-hewn stock-man to drive 2,000 head of cattle across hundreds of miles of the country's most unforgiving land, only to still face the bombing of Darwin, Australia, by the Japanese forces that had attacked Pearl Harbor only months earlier.\\"     Nicole Kidman's Lady Sarah Ashley is much like the actress, strikingly beautiful, with very soft features but a steely strength from within. Kidman, however, seems to play many roles the same way. Her range is only eclipsed by her beauty. Unlike Jackman, who in this role performs as no character I've ever seen him portray before. In addition, being handsome is almost an afterthought to the audience, because he lives this role.     \\"Australia\\" is going to have to compete over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend with the mega hit, \\"Twilight.\\" But for those who are history buffs, those who are fans of Hugh Jackman and want to see a movie that is reminiscent of John Wayne's great epic \\"Red River,\\" I suggest you spend your hard earned money seeing this film. We won't know if Baz Luhrmann is vindicated until the numbers come in from the weekend Box Office tally. But as a genius who knows how to write and direct a film, he gets it. He achieved his goal.     \\"Australia\\" gets Four and a half of Five Stars. The deficit is very minor and Jackman's acting makes up for any lack that any of his costars may share with us. Go see this film, it's really a blockbuster.

B00005QIPH|1.0|In the early 2000s, many listeners and critics hailed The Strokes as the saviour of rock in the same way they did [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nirvana]] ten years beforehand. Even a critic with the intelligence of [[ASIN:0634028618 Joe S. Harrington]] dismissed criticism of the Strokes, writing on the webzine Blastitude an article titled \\"Why Does Everyone Hate the Strokes?\\".<br /><br />With repeated listening, Nirvana can be shown to be no different from the stadium bands the critics who adored them despised. Unfortunately, the Strokes are absolutely no better in this respect. Indeed, \\"Is This It\\" could be viewed as being worse than either Nirvana or preceding stadium bands, for it lacks even the catchy hooks and tunes that makes it at least remotely possible to listen repeatedly. The production and sound on \\"Is This It\\" might be designed to ape the great dream pop bands of the 1980s and 1990s, but it has a terrible effect because the Strokes show they simply cannot create the sort of atmosphere to make a record like [[ASIN:B00006L5PQ Treasure]] or [[ASIN:B000002LRJ Loveless]] or [[ASIN:B000008D63 Love Agenda]]. The simple, sparse, un-layered, guitar, bass and drums sound has been done in the same way many times before. More than that, it takes something really special for this type of power pop to attract my attention because it tends to seem either childish or overblown otherwise. Whilst the Strokes are neither childish nor overblown, they certainly are very bland: the volume changes are exactly like a 1980s power ballad admixed with some ordinary alternative rock from that era: a mix that in no way comes close to gelling.<br /><br />More than that, Julian Casablancas' voice is equally bland and unmemorable. Even on the fastest moments he never sings with serious passion, and on the slower songs he seems quite out of place: together it gives the effect of an adult oriented rock album sung by a punk singer. On most choruses Casablancas fails entirely to get enough breath to give any feeling or memory to the listener, who might almost feel desensitised. The hardest and last song here, \\"Take It or Leave It\\", is an improvement with real hooks and passionate playing, but the macho aftertaste that tends to repel me so much from the hard end of the rock spectrum is enough to prevent me wanting to put this song on my iPod. The opener, \\"Is This It\\", sounds quite like a less tuneful [[ASIN:B000002JJS Foreigner ballad]], whilst the faster \\"The Modern World\\" sounds like too many critically slaved power pop bands to mention. Casablancas' voice becomes particularly grating in the middle of this song. Then \\"Soma\\" sounds like many bad 1990s alternative radio bands in its awfully tuneless loud passages that are no better than \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\". The synsthesised voice of \\"Barely Legal\\" is another lowlight.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Is This It\\" can be described as a terrible kind of record that apes many styles from 1970s power pop through stadium rock, 1980s alternative and 1990s radio alternative without ever gaining a distinctive touch or, before the last track, a memorable hook. Casablancas' grating voice is a further liability: he sings without ever giving his full power in a voice that is terribly tuneless and would be better suited to much more extreme hard rock.or memory to the listener, who might almost feel desensitised.

B000002WU9|5.0|There have been a few great Wu Tang solo albums but none of them got the drop on OB4CL. This is unquestionably one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. And what makes it so unique is the street slang that is distinctively created by Raekwon and Ghostface, making them one of the most potent duos in the hip hop game. They go together like peanut butter and chocolate.     This album boasts no less than 8 bangers in my opinion (in no particular order)  Verbal Intercourse  Rainy Dayz  Can It Be All So Simple (remix)  Criminology  Guillotine (Swordz)  Ice Cream  Glaciers of Ice  Incarcerated Scarfaces    The rest of the album is so solid too you will find it difficult to skip a track, of which there is 18 to tickle your eardrums.    Ratings:  Lyrics - 9.4/10  Production - 9.7/10     Only Built for Cuban Linx II is supposedly coming out later this year, 14 years after its predecessor. If its half as good it will be the 2009 hip hop album of the year.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|I saw Wall-E in theaters, and loved it. After reading online reviews, I decided to make it the first Blu-Ray movie I watched on my new TV, and wow.. it set a high bar.

Everyone will love it.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I've been a fan of the Bond series since Sean Connery.  I've seen them all, and Casino Royale is one of my favorites.  This movie has it all with an interesting story, nice instrumental score, great action, intense drama, and heartfelt romantic scenes.  From the opening moments I was hooked.  I knew this was going to be a smart movie when they used the gun barrel introduction as part of the action.  Outstanding!<br /><br />Daniel Craig gives a good performance as Bond, and his range seems somewhat broader than some of the actors who've played Bond in the past.  Frankly, I would have a difficult time believing some of the previous incarnations would be capable of falling in love.  We also get to see the evolution of Bond from his heated and nieve beginning, to the complex and colder agent we all know.  I think Craig was a wise choice, and I look forward to his future roles.  I just hope the series continues to focus on story, and the more realistic elements of the Bond character.<br /><br />The extras are nice including: Becoming Bond, James Bond: For Real, Bond girls are forever, and the Chris Cornell Music Video.  If you're a fan of Bond, or just a great drama, pick up this DVD.

B000002GQJ|5.0|When listening to this album, it is easy to realize that the band was still on their creative summit.<br />  This is the band's most energetic effort, with uptempo rockers from Justin and John (\\"Question\\" and \\"Tortoise and the Hare\\"). But it's balanced by beautiful masterworks such as \\"And the Tide Rushes In\\" (perhaps the best song from Ray...ever), Mike's \\"How is it, We are Here?\\" (which features the Mellotron at its most haunting), And Justin's \\"Dawning is the Day\\" (which feature one of the coolest middle 8s ever created).<br /><br />  On the avant-garde side of things, we get Greame's \\"Don't You Feel Small?\\", which gives a psychedelic, very alternative sound. And Mike's \\"Melancholy Man\\". This song proves Mike is the master at writing songs about first-person loneliness and despair. These emotions are surrounded by a symphony of heavy Moog Sounds and culminate into a heavenly chorus of vocals; which makes this depressing song very uplifting.<br />  On the middle ground, They give us \\"It's up to You\\". This one isn't a stand-out track, but is a fun song and gives the album a great foundation (reminds me a lot of Eric Claptons' \\"Let It Rain\\", which was released at around the same time). John's \\"Mistral Song\\" is a good effort, as well, though it's a bit too \\"happy\\" for my tastes. Closing out the album is \\"The Balance\\"; perhaps Greame's most beautiful spoken piece.<br />  Though it is commonly known that the Moodies scaled back the instrumentation on AQOB (so they could perform all of the songs on stage as they appear on the album), that was later disproved to an extent by Mike, who said he had never held back on any of his arrangements, and that \\"And The Tide Rushes in\\", \\"Melancholy Man\\", and \\"Dawning is the Day\\", had just as much layering as previous efforts.<br /><br />  This is my second favorite Moodies album, right under TOCCC. It evokes a cool dark imagery; much like the view on the beach on the back cover. But what makes this album really stand out, is that all of the songs are so darned fun! There really isn't a dull moment.<br /> I highly recommend this as a \\"first album\\" to the new Moody Blues listener.rned fun! There really isn't a dull moment.

Moyo poses two questions, first \\"How has aid hurt the development of African countries?\\" and \\"What can be done to lower dependence on aid and develop African economies?\\"    Over the course of the book, Moyo chronicles the way in which the aid given to African countries has spawned war, impoverished the people, and halted meaningful development on the continent.  The repercussions Moyo uses most often do not occur to altruistic western donors and fundraisers.  She also writes about how the aid should be stopped, but likely will not since the non-profit organizations are their own industry that pays employees, etc.    As an alternative to aid, Moyo identifies that direct investment in infrastructure and business is needed to ween Africa off aid cheques, and turn the continent into a major player in manufacturing and agribusiness.  Her argument largely rests on the investment being made currently by China, and also micro-loans.    While the book is thought-provoking and brings an intelligent argument to the table, its is poorly written.  Dead Aid is very repetitive.  Certain scenarios are constantly revisited, and sub-sections in each chapter have little difference between them.     To gain knowledge of the actual argument, I would recommend reading this book.  However, when it comes to the strength of argument and readability of the book, I would recommend checking it out from the library rather than making a purchase.
B001TOD92C|5.0|\\"The Wrestler\\" is the tale of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a legendary pro wrestler from the 80s now penniless, doped-up on steroids, and completely removed from his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). In most Hollywood movies, this is where the hero inevitably reinvents himself, redeems himself, establishes a new relationship with his daughter, and returns to the top of wrestling. If you like those types of movies, then stop reading now because this is not that type of movie. \\"The Wrestler\\" delves deep into the dark underside of pro wrestling, where steroids are taken like aspirin and where the in-ring acts are so violent it's a wonder no one dies in the ring. This is apparently how it is in real life. The reason there's not an old-timers day in pro wrestling is because there are so few wrestlers who live to see 40. Most die as a result of the effects of steroids or the physical violence they endure in the ring. Once you see this movie, something as heinous as Chris Benoit will make more sense (not the fact that he committed these acts, just what led him to those acts).    All the actors in this movie deliver excellent performances. Evan Rachel Wood does a stellar job as The Ram's daughter, really bringing home the anger she has for her dad and her sense of abandonment. Marisa Tomei makes up for her let's be honest undeserved Oscar win by giving a spectacular performance as a stripper and the only friend The Ram has outside the arena. However, Rourke steals the movie. He does such an amazing job that you forgive his flaws and his stupid mistakes. For example, in his final confrontation with his daughter, you feel for Wood's character, but at the same time, in spite of everything, you still end up feeling sorry for The Ram. And The Ram's final speech to the fans is one of those where you wonder whether it's The Ram or Rourke himself talking. Mickey Rourke probably should've won the Oscar for Best Actor, but in the end it doesn't matter. \\"The Wrestler\\" is an excellent movie that will resurrect Rourke's career, and this movie finally shows the world how truly violent pro wrestling can be.
B001RTP48G|5.0|This is easily the best PSB album of the decade. \\"Release\\" was a hit and miss affair, while \\"Fundamental\\" brought back the esscence of their earlier material from the 80s/90s. The new album takes the best bits of \\"Fundamental\\" and throws them into a mix of \\"Very\\" and \\"Behaviour\\", which some argue to be their best albums to date. With that being said, you can not go wrong with purchasing \\"Yes\\".    Every track on this disk is a winner in it's own way, but my favorites are:    Vulnerable (very 80's and very good!)  More than a dream (Disco for 2009)  Building a wall (If only history classes were this interesting..)  King of Rome (May induce tears)  The way it used to be (Reminds me of \\"Please\\", which is awesome!)  Legacy (Think: \\"It couldn't happen here\\", from \\"Actually\\".)    The pacing is very good on \\"Yes\\", and you can listen to it all the way through without getting bored. Even though \\"Yes\\" will probably be their last proper album for a while, it will always be a vibrant ending to a dismal decade.
B000002GQG|4.0|I am really not surprised that this was released without the art work of the inner sleeve.  The record companies jam these CD re-releases out there as cheaply and as rapidly as they can.    As far as the music on the album, I can't say it's their best but it has some exceptional standout songs.  (Voices in the Sky, The Actor, OM).  One of the things that held this band together for so long was that everyone contributed to the song-crafting.  But we all know that Thomas and Pinder and Edge were not the most gifted in that department, and their songs on ISOTLC are pretty weak.    I am confused about people concerned about the album being \\"dated\\", it was recorded in the late 60's, so it is simply  reflection of the time and the culture of the day.  Why are they listening to it if that disturbs them?
B001P9KR8U|5.0|If you're looking for a nice story to ready mindlessly on the beach, this is NOT for you!!! It is rich, colorful, thought provoking, heart breaking, and intense satisfaction all rolled into one.  So when you've got several hours (because there is no way you will want to put it down), then pick up a copy, and snuggle up somewhere warm, and treat yourself to a storytelling delight.    I am not a high powered reviewer, nor does the everyday Joe care a whole lot about what I have to say about books, or anything for that matter... But I so highly recommend this book that I have loaned it to each of my friends, who have then bought copies and loaned to thier friends. In short, it's a GREAT book!!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have not read the books, so I am not trying to compare them, but got this set after I saw a couple of episodes on TV and wanted to see the whole season.    Overall this is alot of fun, a good blend of the supernatural with both humor, sex and violence.  From the opening scene of the first episode when someone goes into a store to get some \\"True Blood\\" (an artifical blood drink for vampires) to the mystery surrounding who did what to who, it is just great and entertaining.    Sometimes the acting has moments that do not hold up, but they are limited and often I think is due to the actors staying in their roles.    Sookie is actually more \\"deep\\" than some people have mentioned, she just does it in a low key matter of fact way without overbearing. Zeljko Ivanek and Stephen Root, actors you will probably recognize, also does a great job in some of the episodes.    This is an HBO series with adult themes, so deifnately not for younger viewers.
B0000508U6|5.0|A great album with hit songs and includes my personal favorites: sparks, yellow, and trouble. Coldplay albums never seem to disappoint!
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Adaptions of books, especially one's I've been engrossed by, as with Schlink's, 'The Reader' are circumspect prospects. There are any number of filmic failures; literality being a chief offence. I hasten to add that this realisation is one of the most profound exceptions to my expectations. All the actors are brilliant and David Hare's adaption of the original text is tense and enthralling. If anything, and I think of Tarkovsky's use of Lem(Solaris), and of Ang Lee's of Priouxl(Brokeback Mountain), this transcends its literary source. The film is fashioned/structured with marvellous and subtle unfolding of awareness and the tragedy of the lead characters as their respective enthusiasms and naive leaping at life turns to disaster. There is no letting up in this movie! I loved the scene in the Jewish daughter's New York apartment where accountability was assessed...the event measured, as was the entire film. Gripping and supremely moving.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I began with four stars but by the time I finished - and I was fast-forwarding through all but the Bill scenes by then - I'd really had it with the gratuitous sex (it IS gratuitous, compared to the Sookie-narrated books, because we really don't need to see what the creepy brother does) and violence, not to mention that the idea of mainstreaming vampires tends to be lost in the cheap thrills and low humor. (Note: yes, the book is violent, but it's the difference between FINDING a dead body and having to watch the murder re-enacted over and over in your face, or having to watch gouts of blood clearly generated by hoses!) I began reading the books after the first two episodes, and they are SO much better in almost every way, other than the inspired casting of Stephen Moyer, who manages to give off a Civil War era vibe quite nicely and has terrific chemistry in his all-too-few scenes (few, since they allowed  supporting and invented minor characters to take over the series; even a major romantic interlude that should have been pure Sookie and Bill is  cross-cut with other characters, destroying the eroticism of the book's comparable scene). Sookie seems to have been dumbed down considerably, and Southern stereotypes abound. The series follows the book to the letter for the first 50 pages, then goes more and more off the rails, much to its detriment. (The vampire trial and its grungy setting was just... idiotic.) I'm going to finish reading the books and give up on the series, though I'm happy to insert Moyer's face and manner into the proceedings.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Actually 4 stars, but hated seeing the rating dragged down so much by people who evidently can't read the kindle not fine print that says &#34;NY Times BESTSELLER list&#34;@ at 9.99 it doesn't say new releases... The book:  engaging, entertaining and a return to form for Lee Child.
B001NE80P4|4.0|High School Musical 3 is the third movie in the High School Musical series but the first to be released as a feature length film in theatres.  The story is straightforward and not reliant on having seen the other films.<br /><br />Troy and Danielle are in their final year of High School.  She is planning to study pre-law at Stanford while he plans to remain in Alberqueque on a basketball scholarship alongside his best friend Chad, this fulfilling his father's dream.  However when the drama teacher files an application in his name for Julliard, it causes him to question what he wants to do in life. At the same time the senior year is gearing up for the Senior Prom and also planning its final High School Musical, which gives the students a chance to demonstrate their considerable talents in the hopes of attaining scholarships to Julliard.<br /><br />The movie is squeaky clean - Troy and Danielle only exchange chaste kisses and as you'd expect with Disney there is no bad language and or inappropriate sub-plots.  But more than this it is a thoroughly enjoyable film, in large part because of the enthusiasm and energy that Zac Efron brings to the lead role of Troy.  The CD has been on high rotation in my car and is surprisingly endurable.<br /><br />While it's probably 20 minutes too long and it certainly won't be winning any Oscars, children aged 7-15 will not be able to resist this one.  The appeal is more gender-neutral than I would have thought: I have sons, but the basketball sub-plot and the camaraderie between Troy and Chad sustained their attention.

0385339585|2.0|This was my first Grisham novel. Having heard so much about him from the movies made from his books and the huge amount of shelf space allotted his works, I expected something much better. I expected at least decent. This isn't.<br /><br />First the good. The story is well plotted (if plodding) and ties up with no serious loose ends. The tie up may not be to your liking. I found it repulsive but I don't hold that against the novel. After all, it is a tie up.<br /><br />The bad is pretty much the rest starting with the very poor lower level writing seemingly pitched to a 3rd grade (8 years old) reading comprehension level. We get sentences (mine, not Grisham's) sounding like \\"The lawyer walked up the hill. He saw far. He went down the hill. He told the other lawyers he saw far.\\" Try that for over 300 pages.<br /><br />All the characters are repulsive. The initial mover is nastier than Snidely Whiplash and just as unbelievable. The 'family' are a mash up of Euro and US trailer trash. The maybe hero (well he's most of the book) is lazy and incredibly stupid - although being a lawyer, he's fantastically wealthy or once was and may be again. The many rich trample over the common folks not minding the damage they do as they pass.<br /><br />There is what I suppose is an angelic character in the book. She's a hippie dippy space case death cult witch. Able to exist where no other whites dare venture, she not only seems to exist without any earthly wants, but she can transport herself over many kilometers without touching down in any intervening areas.<br /><br />This book has it all - from naked stone age superstitious natives to fantastic wealth to deplorable children and then you got Miss Space Case to the rescue as well. Me? I wish I'd never met any of them.<br /><br />First Grisham book and 100% sure it's the LAST.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Action, action, and more action --- a big reward for this Star Trek fan. So much action I had to see it a second time for no other reason except I really enjoyed this picture.    A time-traveling Romulan armed with a doomsday machine intends to make short work of Vulcan and Earth. Kirk, Spock, Bones, and crew are young Starfleet cadets called into emergency service when things go terribly wrong. Kirk and Spock have some personal issues to deal with enroute, but encouragement from another time traveler,an old friend this time, readies them to face the enemy together. Five stars for excitement and fun, fun, fun. Can't wait for the next one.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|I'm not generally a fan of superhero movies, but wanted to see this movie because of all of the hype surrounding Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. I remember watching Jack Nicholson's Joker as a kid and being scared to go to bed. However, Heath Ledger takes the joker, and acting in the villain role, to a whole new level. Ledger achieves what few actors playing villains ever have - he has created a character so repulsive and deranged, but at the same time complicated and unpredictable. In the Dark Knight, Ledger's Joker is a sadistic anarchist who devises sick games to force people into making wrenching moral choices. My favorite one is where he plants explosives on two ferries, one with convicts and the other with civilians, and gives passengers on each ferry a detonator to the bombs on the other ferry - and forces them to make a decision by midnight! I won't spoil what happens, but the outcome was surprising.    The rest of the movie was good, but sometimes seemed a bit to into itself. At times, the plot twists and turns seemed a bit too intricate and unrealistic (yes, I know, we're talking about Batman, but still). At too many points it seemed the villains (and sometimes the heroes) managed to install dynamite, find people, and perform other tricks by magic. The movie uses \\"corrupt cops\\" as an excuse to drive the plot too many times, rather than actually explaining how, for example, the Joker takes over an entire building, plants dynamite on two ferries, knows exactly where all of the main characters are. Why were dogs such a problem for Batman - and how did Joker know to exploit them? And by the way, how did Dent escape from the hospital when it blew up? There were just a few too many leaps. Overall it was a fun movie, with great drama, tension, and fighting scenes, but it could have been better.    More seriously, I thought the sound quality was poor. At times, I could barely understand Christian Bale when he was Batman. He sounded muffled and coarse. Some of the other voices didn't come across well. I have a pretty good sound system that I've used with many other movies, so it seems like the problem stemmed from the film recording itself.
0812975219|5.0|This great book deals with the role of chance, luck and probability in life.  We all grow up being taught that hard work equals success.  Taleb shatters this myth, which many people will find unsettling.<br /><br />We have all seen many people who work physically hard jobs, be they personal relations or someone you see in passing.  How many of these people slave their life away for no pay?  On the flip side, how many people have we known or come across making millions for some work done on a phone or computer?  How many people are in a good field working really hard that never get rich?<br /><br />Military history is loaded with examples of generals who trust in Fortune.  It is the ultimate deciding factor and while this is hard for some to swallow, Taleb presents an outstanding argument demonstrating that luck is the underlying factor behind success.<br /><br />My late father had 2-years of modest (for him) income followed by a 3-year stretch where he brokered a series of deals that paid over $10 million.  He became very overconfident in his superior abilities, and I started to point out the role of luck in his success.  He dismissed my argument and gave me the hard work speech.  He was wrong.  When all the right forces converge you are lucky, and only then does success arrive.  Fooled by Randomness is a detailed investigation into the role of luck in life and work.  I highly recommend it, especially if this principle is contrary to your current views.
1416562605|4.0|\\"The White Tiger\\" is an immensely intimate and realistic look at the polarized lifestyle of the rich vs. the poor in India. Like the movie \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\", this book is a rags-to-riches story that involves murder and mystery.     Told in a flashback mode in a first-person narrative, \\"The White Tiger\\" is an account of how a lowly country peasant evolved into a driver and subsequently, an entrepreneur. Along the way, complex themes such as morality, rich vs. poor and justice are explored. The story is told with such dry, wry humor that I couldn't help but laugh out loud despite the serious nature of the issue.    Like \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\", this book can be read in either a positive or negative light about the state of India. Nevertheless, it's a highly entertaining, yet thoughtful read at the same time. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a darkly humorous and thoughtful book.
B001EO748M|1.0|You must be kidding.  This is the most inaccurate and ridiculous portrayal of these people.  King Henry never gets fat, and his health issues--both of which drove him mercilessly after Anne Boleyn--are never addressed.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers remains handsome and gorgeous throughout this idiotic jumble.  An absolute falsehood.  The best portrayal, however, has to be in the inestimable Sam Neill has Cardinal Wolsey.  Season One is worth it just for this characterization.  The rest of it is simply laughable.

B000SQJ27I|3.0|This album differs from Manu's other studio efforts in that it does not have all the musical cubism and funny business that were hallmarks of his first two studio albums; unfortunately, Manu Chao needs musical cubism and funny business for his music to sing.

B00005V9IK|4.0|Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition) (1996) was a very entertaining 4 star film.  Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are always good as were most of the well selected crew. This film featured a good story, great cast, and fine special effects. The creature design for the aliens was imaginative and very credible.<br /><br />I understand that the Air Force could not give this film its full support because of the UFO reference made to Area 51. They desired to, however, and were very happy with the patriotic plot and the positive light it placed the US Air Force in.

B00006IM9Q|5.0|This 2002 release of BLONDIE-GREATEST HITS CD is definitely worth purchasing. It replaces 1981's release [[ASIN:B000003JAL The Best of Blondie]] and features 24-bit digital remastering on all tracks and they sound better than ever.<br /><br />It includes the special mixes of \\"Rapture,\\" \\"Heart Of Glass,\\" \\"Sunday Girl,\\" and \\"In The Flesh\\" that were included on \\"The Best Of...\\" album and the original mix of \\"Denis.\\" I only knew the latter song from [[ASIN:B000008DJM Once More into the Bleach]] [another brilliant CD I recommend] and that was a different extended version--but both sound great.<br /><br />BLONDIE-GREATEST HITS contains all the tracks that were on \\"The Best Of Blondie\\" plus 7 more, including \\"Maria\\" from the 1999 reunion album [[ASIN:B000W7Y2GE No Exit]].<br /><br />The cover insert folds out and contains information like single chart position and which album the singles were originally on, color photos, and excellent liner notes by Steve Pafford.<br /><br />Blondie's contribution to popular music cannot be measured by album sales or popularity alone. The reverberations of their music can still be felt today as a new generation discovers the group's music and their influence on current singers and bands is far and wide.<br /><br />BLONDIE-GREATEST HITS is the perfect intro to that music. It has some of Blondie's best known songs and shows their amazing versatility as they cross genres of popular music including rap (Rapture), calypso (The Tide Is High), rock (The Hardest Part), disco (Heart Of Glass), and 50s du-wop (In The Flesh) just to name a few.<br /><br />Even though it replaces the original album nicely, I'm still keeping my copy of 1981's \\"The Best Of Blondie\\" because I love the cover photo and it holds a sentimental value for me.
0312360266|1.0|Well, my friend kept telling me on and on about how amazing this book was so I bought three books from the series. I couldn't even stand reading the first one up to the end. I hated the characters and completely detested the books lack of twists and turns.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|Certainly is tons of action in this movies, and no complications like plot twists or love interests. Just cars, crashes, murders and action. Statham is great ... just his usual self. How can you beat it? Don't look for Gone With the Wind, and you'll be happy.  A great non-chick flick. Don't misunderstand, I like 27 Dresses, but as a mindless wonderful action film, this one is just fine.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I never heard of this movie until I read about it on a Blu-Ray discussion board recently (the poster's wife started crying it moved her so much).  This movie was done by Ron Fricke who also did \\"Chronos\\" and is filmed in 70mm Todd-AO format.<br /><br />This is by far and away the best looking High Definition (Blu-Ray or HD-DVD) disc I have looked at--period!  The whole time it was on I couldn't help but be \\"distracted\\" by how clear and beautiful the images were.<br /><br />As far as content, I prefer \\"Chronos\\" a bit better, but \\"Baraka\\" is quite mesmerizing in its own right.  The soundtrack includes one of my favorite bands, Dead Can Dance, which works well with the movie images.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone's collection.

B00005R2IS|5.0|Personally I loved Mad Max. To me and more than a few of my friends who were into bikes back then (79 to 85) Mad max along with Quadrophenia made us feel like we were badguys (hey we were young). After watching Max and co young bikers across the UK attempted to emulate Max, Goose, Toecutter by being mean moody and more than a bit sad just as their predecessors had tried to emulate Marlon Brando (The Wild One) and Peter Fonda (Easy Rider) years before.    The film although low budget is none the worse for that as it takes away some of the glitz that hollywood loves to throw into films and sometimes ruins by doing so (e.g. Thunderdsome Mad Max 3).    The stunts are terific and the use of outback shots enhances the desolation the film seeks to portray. The acting is weak in some respects but the actors who portray 'the Goose' and 'the Toecutter' stand out even above Mel Gibson with performances that while believable are just the right side of over the top.    The sound is excellent with good mood music work by Brian May. However in some places the speeded up driving and riding shots fail to work as well as they might. But in other areas the feel is just right e.g. Goose's ride out the morning after his night of passion with the nightclub singer.    Overall a real groundbreaker which has rarely been beaten and which will still be remembered in years to come as a classic of Aussie cinema.

0790744295|3.0|I couldn't see this creepshow when it was first released. Being scared and sheltered in my early ears, i wasn't too fond of scary movies.<br /><br />For some reason during my first pregnancy I couldn't get enough of scary movies and happened to catch this on cable. I was disgusted, shocked and oddly aroused at how creepy the stories became. I enjoyed myself immensely.<br /><br />As an author of several romance suspense I realized that you could still entertain through horror and that the genres of comedy and horror could mix well, even if it was close to absurdity.<br /><br />The only thing I did find disappointing was the audio. I had to turn up the volume in order to hear the actors voices - especially on the \\"father's day\\" story. It sounded as if everyone spoke in low tones and then the music would be too loud.<br /><br />Other than that, I'd recommend this movie to others who have not explored the creepshow genre, which I feel is in a class by itself. I plan to get the sequels as well to add to my collection.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|I would say 'the best', but come on: 'Nosferatu', even rabid fanboys must agree, is the all-time champ. This film, however, is also a classic-in-the-making, with as much thoughtful admiration of its subject as a great work of literature might have.<br /><br />Yes, the subtitles were sadly lacking. But I think this film stands up to Hitchcock's test of 'pure cinema' - leave the sound off and you still have a magnificently shot and masterfully executed narrative that anybody can follow. The Blu-Ray format lends itself well to showcasing the stark Stockholm nights, the barren landscapes and the unsettling, asymmetrical framing. Falling snow and spilled blood are as lovingly shot as the translucent skin of the extraordinarily beautiful boy playing Oskar, Kare Hedebrant. The nascent relationship - which, fascinatingly, goes waaaay beyond 'first love' - is intriguingly and tenderly handled. And, for those of us who want only the subtlest touch of violence in our horror films, Alfredson gives us several pivotal scenes that are nice and gruesome, but not sloppily overwhelming. I loved the careful way that the motivating elements of the story essentially bookend the film, so that the viewer can either ignore them - if the 'vampire-y' aspects are found more interesting - or embrace them.<br /><br />BRILLIANT.
B001N26GFC|4.0|This is an interesting character study.  How often in life do we encounter people who are genuinely a joy to be around?  Poppy(Sally Hawkins) is just naturally a happy person.  Her ebullience is not some defense mechanism or a mask for some inner depression.  Life isn't a complete bowl of cherries for Poppy but she copes through her lust for the better things life has to offer.  This film is not some cynical exercise rife with manipulation.  Director Mike Leigh keeps the film firmly grounded in reality.  It also helps to have a superb actress like Hawkins to project likability and make it believable.  Hawkins, stiffed at Oscar time, is a real find and it will interesting to follow the trajectory of her career.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Ok, first let me start by saying I really loved this story. The beginning was a little slow, but once it picked up, it was impossible to put down. Now, this is a difficult book to review because after finding out the ending (which was a TOTAL surprise!) I had a few questions about things that just didn't make sense to me. Unfortunately I can't really get into them here without the risk of giving something away. I'll try though.<br /><br />One of the biggest things I didn't get was, why was Grace the only person Hannah would talk to during the period when she spent all her time in the library? After everything that had happened, and the REASON for it happening, I would think Grace would be the LAST person she'd want to see. Also, you would think one of the first things Hannah asked her about, after everything was said and done, was the whole shorthand thing. I just find it hard to believe that she would mention it only as a casual statement months later...it was a HUGE thing! Ok...I'll stop there. Only people who read the book would really understand what I mean, but overall, these are just small complaints.<br /><br />If you like family saga's and early twentieth century fiction, then you should LOVE this book. I really connected with the main characters, and could picture myself at Riverton, and Seventeen Grosvenor. Ms. Morton certainly has a way with descriptions. I look forward to reading more of her novels, and aside from the few things that didn't make sense to me, I absolutely recommend.

0679882820|2.0|Like many other reviewers, I was upset to learn that many of the Dr. Seuss board books are condensed, abridged, or even \\"based on\\" original paper paged books.  This in itself is not a bad thing, a 12 month old only has so much attention span, and a board book can only be so long.<br /><br />Having not read \\"Mr. Brown Can Moo...\\" when I was little, I was unaware that this is not the original version.  In fact, I didn't realize many of these books were not original until I bought \\"There's a Wocket in my Pocket\\" and didn't recognize it as the book I had when I was little.  After doing some research, I learned that these books were abridged (or in some cases, completely changed...see \\"Go Dog, Go\\") from their original state, but this is not made clear on the front or back covers of the books.  I feel a little deceived.  Knowing this, I would have bought only the original versions once my oldest was past the point of destroying books.  I only continued to buy the board versions for the durability.<br /><br />That said, a short, durable book with animal noises is still good for an infant but I would avoid this for a toddler.  It's too short and it's missing some of the rhyming and meter evident in the original.

B00005Y6YB|5.0|This mini series reminds me of how I have longed for a good western and why I am a fan of westerns in general.The story never gets old(to me anyways)a long and close frienship is tested,good versus bad,rescuing the girl.Other reviewers are right when they stated that Duvall and Jones ARE McCrea and Call.I know some of you will laugh after reading this,but I really can identify with both characters in this movie.I see myself as the serious Call,but also the jester McCrea.I guess that's why I love Lonesome Dove so much.Most people will probably relate to one or the other character.I won't sit here and say that everytime I view it I find something new,NO,I just love this story and everything about it...plain and simple.Kids now a days really don't know what they are missing.The camp fires,the horse trails,stagecoaches and chuck wagons,salons,gamblers,cattle rustlers,indian raids,the list could go on and on!This movies has it all for any true western fan.I'd hoped that westerns were making a comeback,but,t.v. viewers are more interested in reality t.v. rather than entertainment,so the western might be riding into the sunset(I really hope not,it is what defines US,as Americans!).I have been to three different countries so far in my life.A good portion of the people in those countries all wanted to be American cowboys!That should say something about America!Yes,I would recommend this mini series to ANYONE,not only does it tell a great story about friendship,but it also tells a great story about us Americans!

B000VPUIA6|5.0|Another Beatles classic.  This is one of the first Beatles movies I watched with my family, and it was a great gift for them.  It came with cards, a poster, a decent 60-page book which included movie production notes, and a reproduction of the original script.  My family already owned this on VHS, but the DVD version was re-mastered and is of higher quality.  Highly recommended!

B000W1V5OC|5.0|I do not usually like \\"live\\" albums yet alone \\"live\\" DVD videos. Most of the time bands sound great with a studio production. Nightwish is a fantastic exception. Their videos on YouTube have thrilled viewers worldwide, including myself. I had to break down and buy this music DVD, just to see for it for myself, and I was not disappointed. This DVD is great! It should have accompanied Nightwish's CD. It's the same music as their End Of An Era CD, with wonderful live video footage from their concerts, and a thought provoking documentary. In my biased opinion, its the best live concert DVD I have seen to date, as I am a big fan of Nightwish. This is one DVD that is worth watching over and over again.
0307269981|5.0|Lisbeth Salander, an angry young hacker and cyber-embezzler, is out of the frying pan and into the fire as the prime suspect in three murders.  Yet Larsson hides from the reader key details about how Lisbeth became a suspect and whether she is guilty - we don't want to believe it, but there are these facts to consider. . . . Slowly the third person narrator takes the reader inside the heads of key players to reveal some - but not all - of Lisbeth's secrets as well as the hidden actions and motives of people all around her.<br /><br />Mikael Blomqvist returns to do what he can to defend his former lover, whom he believes to be innocent. Larsson sustains the tension in their relationship by almost but not quite bringing the two face-to-face throughout most of the book.<br /><br />While I know little about computer technology, I appreciate that Larsson included 21st Century technology in his plots.  In this era, I expect brilliant sleuths to use the Web but hope they won't get too technical or cross the line into the kind of computer science fiction I suspect I am seeing on some tv detective shows.  Lisbeth's skill as a hacker and user of gadgets manages to strike the right balance.<br /><br />This sequel does a good job of developing the terrific main characters from Larsson's \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".  Lisbeth is a fresh, tough and fascinating 21st Century woman and this book shows us some of the sources of her smart and skeptical nature. I look forward to learning more about her complex background and inner life in the next installment of the trilogy.  I already suspect that the first chapters of \\"Fire\\" will play an important role in the plot of the third book.

B00008PC2O|5.0|The Terminator series is one of the greatest science fiction franchises of all time. My favorite is Judgment Day, but the original is also great and I am not so sure about Rise of the Machines. The extended edition of this entry contained a lot of never-before-seen footage that helped it feel more complete. Arnold Schwarznegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their respective roles of the T-800 and Sarah Connor with a cameo of Michael Bhien as Kyle Reese in a deleted dream sequence, with newcomers like Robert Patrick as T-1000 and Edward Furlong as the adolescent John Connor. The action was exciting, the storyline was worthy of picking up where its predecessor left off, and the acting was well-rehearsed. The visual effects were so real. It didn't use CGI much, mostly miniatures, makeup, and anamatronics. The CGI was only used for the T-1000 shape shifting parts, the right way, sparingly and hardly noticeable. Abusing CGI for living characters makes it look fake. The plot is where Skynet tries again to kill John Connor in the past and sends the T-1000 to achieve this goal, and the future Connor sends a reprogrammed T-800 to protect his younger self. It shows John in foster care after his mother Sarah ended up in a mental institution when she tried to tell authorities about Judgment Day and thought she was a psycho. At the mall, John and his friend were attacked by the T-1000 and the T-800 comes to the rescue. John teaches him about human characteristics, such as speech, like Chill out, Hasta-la-vista, baby, no problemo, etc. John also explained why killing is wrong. It is because we have feelings. Together, they help Sarah escape from the hospital and the trio goes to stop Skynet. This was a great action flick that will keep you entertained for hours, now with all these extras, and an extended version that includes deleted scenes to help the film feel more complete. Too bad the the original version on this DVD can only be played on a P.C. If you want to play the originalversion on T.V., please get the original DVD revision as well.    Edit: I just saw Rise of the Machines more clearly with a friend, and we both thought that was where the franchise hit mediocrity without James Cameron. I will give in-depth reviews of that entry and the original soon.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Jack Reacher. He's the man, that's all there is to it. Is this a perfect novel? Nope. But since Jack is tha star, it's tough to give it any less than 4 stars. A terrifically gripping start. Awesome Reacher classic lines. Very enjoyable scenes. Not the best Reacher book, but a standard, classic, enjoyable Lee Child book. He is definitely one of the best characters in any novel today.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|I am sorry that one reviewer was sad but for those of  us who have lived life with many chronic serious illnesses and have surmounted the losses of losing mates and children, this film was life reaffirming and embodies the wheel of life that can often resemble a roller-coster.  Every character in this film, if you pay close attention, has had major loves, losses, and most have continued beyond the expected END, in so many instances. Hope , faith and love replace the regret that can cripple the willingness to go beyond the human expectation of others.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are at the top of their performances, far surpassing their duo in Babel. There  was much more chemistry and honesty in their performances in this film. My only regret was the audio when Ms. Blanchett is talking to her daughter and near death. Yes, I realize she must have had a stroke but many lines were not understandable. Julia Ormand was wonderful and it was fabulous to see her again after so much time.<br /><br />It is true that everyone wishes for a happier time, a time of great love, holding a loved one who is alive, a simpler time in history, a clock that could take us backwards to a joyous moment but that is the essence of this film- LIVE LIFE NOW and live without regret. Loving everything on this human roller-coster ride called LIFE will show us how to  ride without ever giving up.  EVEN IF OTHERS TELL US WE WILL NOT SURVIVE- POPPYCOCK! As long as we share our stories, we live in the hearts of those we love and if they pass that story on, as in this film, love will live forever.

What else can I say....It's JOE!
B001TCHDPS|3.0|'Cold Fact' is much better.  I wanted to love this album, I really did.  I wanted to go to it and have it be something special from a bygone era.  As it is, though, if you're curious, go for a cheap copy (maybe slightly worn or used) and satisfy your curiosity.  It's still better than a lot of stuff (read: tuneful and well put together), but it's not a capital 'G' great album.<br /><br />\\"Heikke's Suburbia Bus Tour\\" is one standout track as well as the first track, but it lacks the basic diversity that made Cold Fact so much fun.<br /><br />Then again, the dude only put out two albums before retreating into his hermetic existence (I read that he doesn't even have a phone), so when you DO get Cold Fact, you'll be piqued about this one.  I have too much ambivalence to tell you whether to get this or not, but you can use my ambivalence (hopefully) as a guide to decide whether or not to get it.<br /><br />Finding a cheap copy would be the best way to do it - I'm probably ambivalent because I paid almost full price to get it when it came out and it didn't have front-to-back 'oooo' moments.  The first song on Cold Fact was \\"Sugarman\\" and I'd heard it enough times to be excited when Cold Fact got reissued, and I was looking forward to this one getting reissued as well, but it doesn't have the same nostalgic feel as Cold Fact does - or maybe it does and my scope of musical references isn't broad enough, but it just doesn't get me there.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars because the musicianship is still high-quality and you can play it for anyone without having to turn it down or skip tracks, maybe on 'random' with a good assortment of other CDs at a party.<br /><br />0 out of 1 people found the earlier review helpful, so I decided to write more about it - hopefully this'll do ya.<br /><br />p.s. I'm glad the dude is getting another chance and hopefully he'll get back into the studio to make another great one.
0385341008|4.0|As has happened somewhat frequently in the past, I bypassed this book several times, thinking it would not be that interesting, and once again a friend gave it to me to read indicating how much they loved it and knew I would too.<br /><br />Well, they were right.  I did love it.  I found that I grew to love the likable, friendly, eccentric residents of Guernsey and thought the way the story was told was definitely unique and done remarkably well.<br /><br />If I have any criticism, it's that the first 30-50 pages are somewhat slow going, but once the pace picked up, I was completely engrossed in the story.  I'm glad I didn't follow my initial instincts.
B001E95ZHY|4.0|The Rocker speaks to all those who want to live out their rock `n' roll dream of making it big, and playing in front of a huge crowd. At times you get a sense where the film is heading, and can predict some parts, especially towards the end, but it is a very engaging and light-hearted comedy about fame, loyalty, and, of course, rock. What was refreshing was that there wasn't an overabundance of profanity or crudeness in a film that could have easily gone that route; instead, the film's comedy relies more on great lines from its main character \\"Fish\\" and parody-like situations with the band. Comparisons between The Rocker and School of Rock seem to abound in the reviews, and Rainn Wilson seems to bring the same energy to this role as Jack Black did in School of Rock, but I thought this was the better of the two films.     The film's premise: After Vesuvius' show before a Cleveland crowd in 1986, the band decides to drop drummer Robert Fishman (\\"Fish\\") in hopes of their shot at big-time fame. Twenty years later, Fish is spurned by Vesuvius' popularity and fame as one of the greatest bands ever, and bitterly contemplates what could have been as he works in his cubicle while coworkers listen to Vesuvius. After being fired, Fish's nephew offers him a chance to play with them in a school prom, and Fish begins to realize that this might be his new-found chance at realizing his long lost dreams. His new band, A.D.D., begins to make waves in the music scene after sudden YouTube fame, and with their scumbag hipster agent (played by Saturday Night Live's Jason Sudeikis) they make their way up to the top and the eventual chance to play in front of a Cleveland crowd. However, there is a catch to this opportunity for Fish. He has a big dilemma: does he choose his pride, or loyalty?     Overall, this is quite an enjoyable and funny film. There are some laugh out loud scenes, and the casting for the various roles is fantastic. It is funny enough to be engaging, yet not too over thetop to make one disgusted. Among other stars in the film are Christina Appelgate as one of the band member's moms and Saturday Night Live's Fred Armisen as one of the members of Vesuvius. Rainn Wilson really brings an exceptional amount of humor to his role. Another great aspect of this comedy is that you seem to care, and root, for the main character along the way.     Great film!

B000005RT8|1.0|I like the infectious \\"Coming Up\\", and \\"Goodnight Tonight\\" is alright, but in between that is a whole lot of filler, not of it memorable. \\"Temporary Secretary\\" is a song that's like listening to nails on a chalk board.     \\"Waterfalls\\" is not a bad song, but it just doesn't sound so good in this version.     McCartney got his act together after this album with the good \\"Pipes of Peace\\", the even better \\"Tug of War\\", and the under-rated \\"Press to Play\\". I'd say skip this first effort of the 80's, which is a hollow experiment in sound.

B000002UQJ|5.0|I complain too often that McCartney's works usually feature 3 or 4 good songs, with filler eating up the rest of the albums. I'm a fan of \\"Flowers In The Dirt\\", and I thought \\"Press To Play\\" before that was vastly underrated. But OTG continues to be an album where I can put the whole thing on shuffle, and it just tickles my ears.     It's catchy, and for the first time in ages this album actually shows that he can write adult songs, particularly the socially conscious ones on this album, from \\"C'Mon People\\" to the wonderful \\"Looking For Changes\\". \\"Mistress and Maid\\" is very well written, and like \\"Biker Like An Icon\\", he's able to play the characters involved in the songs as well as to play the part of the reporter who is telling us about it. Not very many singers can do that.     Sometimes it just bugs me when McCartney and the other ex-Beatles get all \\"rinky dinky doo\\" with their songwriting, and other than the \\"fish in a sunbeam\\" in \\"Golden Earth Girl\\", Paul really sheds a lot of ham here, and production-wise, this album is the best all-around listen.     Just a great and complete record. \\"Get Out Of My Way\\" rocks, \\"Hope of Deliverance\\" is catchy as hell, the title track sets a great tone for the rest of the album. Excellent.
0060558121|5.0|My first Neil Gaiman novel was Neverwhere, which I found to be somewhat disappointing.  I thought maybe Neil Gaiman was just another overrated writer but I decided to give him one more chance.  I'm really glad I didn't write Gaiman off after just one novel because American Gods was everything I was hoping Neverwhere would be and wasn't.<br /><br />American Gods surprised me with sheer creativity. Gaiman presented a concept I had never considered before. The United States has long been a cultural melting pot in which tradition, religion and identity have all become meshed and blurred at the seams.  Over the years many of the old beliefs of immigrants have faded and the gods they brought with them from the old world have slipped into obscurity and myth.  So what then has become of these outdated icons? In American Gods Gaiman explores this concept through a brilliant work of dark fantasy and rich folklore.<br /><br />Gaiman pits old world gods of lore against the gods of the modern world: rising monoliths such as television and internet.  American Gods is not merely fiction; Gaiman truly has something to say about American culture in relation to religion and our rapidly changing society. This novel isn't like anything I've ever read or seen before. American Gods is a rich folklore which draws the reader into a world of warring gods and self discovery.<br /><br />Gaiman's talent for writing shows strongly in every lyrical line of prose; each sentence is dripping with powerful description and detail that paints a vivid picture in the mind of the reader. I also enjoyed the outlandish characters that pop up throughout the novel as well as the stoic main character, Shadow.  There are several little twists that make this book interesting and addictive.  I don't recommend that you read this book; I demand that you read it...now!

1416595546|5.0|This tautly written drama is rich in atmosphere and captures the tension and idealism underlying Revolutionary Russia.  Yet, as the story moves into the Stalin era, the erosion of those ideals is woven into the interplay of well-drawn characters. Sashenka, herself, is an idealistic, almost but not quite fanatical, revolutionary who resists the belief that the revolution has been subverted by Stalin's rise to power.  This is revolutionary Russia drawn up-close and personal.    A compelling read that easily flows smoothly and powerfully past its minor flaws.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I must admit, I really wasn't expecting this.  I had anticipated seeing yet another \\"superhero movie\\" and being visually entertained for a couple hours, but this adaptation of the allegedly legendary graphic novel Watchmen far exceeded my initial expectations.  David Hayter, who last wrote the first two X-Men movies, really outdid himself in writing this epic 160-minute film.<br /> Set in the 1980s, Watchmen focuses on a handful of superheroes whose servitude to the world neither seems wanted nor necessary, with the exception of the enigmatic and omnipotent Dr. Manhattan.  When one of the Watchmen is murdered at the beginning of the movie, it sets the stage for a jam-packed tale centered around questions of revenge and the human condition.  Unlike other superhero movies I've seen in the past, not only do you have dazzling special effects and a multitude of action sequences, but the accompaniment of blood, gore, nudity, sex, and swearing.  This, coupled with the dark imagery pervading the film, does a fantastic job of making the movie an adult feature, rather than a just torrent of guys and girls in tights kicking each others' rear ends.  Heavily emotive and extremely interesting flashbacks show the history behind the characters if you, like me, am not aware of the details behind the graphic novel (which I believe gave me a distinct advantage).<br /> The plot gives the feeling of a true crime type of movie, which further allows one to view the story as more of a tragedy than a simple action movie.  The acting is particularly well done, and I was pleasantly surprised to see Jackie Earle Haley as one of the main characters (his last performance that I saw in Little Children made this role even more unexpected).  The aforementioned special effects, though fantastic, don't overshadow the movie itself, and the mysterious orchestral score adds suspense and trepidation.  To further the impression of a dark drama set in the past, the score is peppered with songs from Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Jimi Hendrix, and others.  Though the movie was nearly three hours long, I was never bored and yet was consciously aware of its length.<br /> All in all, I hope (and believe) that Watchmen will open the door for more mature and adult-themed superhero films with R ratings, and being the first one of its kind, does a damn good job of setting the bar for those of its kind yet to come.  If you're looking for superhero action mixed with Dark Knight-styled imagery and lots of extras, you simply can't get any better than this.n & Garfunkel, Jimi Hendrix, and others.

B001FB55HQ|3.0|In the future, John Connor leads the human resistance against Skynet, a worldwide force of sentient machines hell-bent on destroying mankind, whom are viewed as mortal enemies.  In The Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the title role, as a cyborg who has been sent back in time to kill John's mother Sarah Connor; it is believed that eliminating Sarah would prevent John from being born and allow the machines to \\"win.\\"  A man named Kyle Reese is also sent back, by the humans, to protect Sarah; he succeeds, hence Skynet's attempt fails, and we find out that Kyle ends up being the father of the unborn John Connor.  Terminator 2: Judgement Day focuses on another killing machine, the T-1000, as it is sent back in time to kill John himself as a child, to fulfill the same purpose.  Yet again, the machines are met with failure.<br /> Way back when I saw Terminator 2 for the first time, I remember thinking that the storyline was one of the coolest in any of the movies I had seen.  That was over 12 years ago, when I hadn't seen many movies to begin with.  Even today, T2 stands as one of the best ever; the action, acting, music, and even special effects stand the test of time and still blow me away every instance I watch.  The Terminator, which I saw very soon after, filled in all the gaps and then some to a franchise that haunts me to this day.  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines seems to be widely regarded as a critical failure and misstep in the series, a mockery of everything T1 had foretold and T2 had knocked out of the park: the antics of an aged Arnold Schwarzenegger, a \\"Terminatrix,\\" and a seemingly bad choice of actor for John Connor's character.  I couldn't disagree more; Arnie once again rocked, Nick Stahl pulled off a wonderfully believable John Connor, and the twist ending in my mind made for a more than worthy addition to one of my all-time favorite movie series.  And then there was the sadly now-defunct Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles TV series, also berated by many fans.  I thought it was genius in every regard.  If you couldn't tell, I'm a rabid Terminator fan.<br /> Fast forward to 2009, where director McG has unleashed Terminator Salvation upon the world.  I had been looking forward to this film for many months, not only because it's another Terminator movie, but because McG had a trump card:  Christian Bale of recent Batman fame as survivalist John Connor.  I was absolutely certain that both of these beloved factors combined would make for yet another masterpiece that would be treasured in the Terminator collection.  And days after I've seen it, I'm still not ready to determine whether or not it belongs there.<br /> The Terminator series, in my mind, were always more than just action movies.  They were foreboding, horrifying windows into the potential dangers of technology and nuclear war.  The state of the planet after Judgement Day, the machine-initiated nuclear attack, as illustrated by James Cameron in T1 and T2, was dark, menacing, bleak, and felt frightfully real.  Terminator Salvation changes that, not necessarily on purpose, but because the film feels like a repackaging of the first two, wrapped in the pretty red bow of current action movie pap all too common in today's world of short attention spans.  Salvation focuses on two main things: John Connor trying to find and save the life of Kyle Reese (who turns out to be his father), and on a man named Marcus who wants revenge on the machines for very different reasons.<br /> Fortunately, Salvation does do one thing very well:  keep the viewer on the edge of their seat with tons of action sequences and great special effects.  Those expecting another deep, existential, philosophical twist relating to the Terminator mythology however, will be disappointed.  This is really the paradoxical thing about Terminator Salvation:  I honestly did enjoy the movie.  But I can't seem to lump it with the other Terminator movies.  Maybe it's Christian Bale, whom I worship; he just plain and simple is not a good John Connor.  He acts his tail off, but I can't help but feel that he was brought on board for \\"star power.\\"  Maybe it's McG's illustration of the state of the planet; post-Judgement Day is that of a desert wasteland, akin to the most recent movie outages of Resident Evil and Final Fantasy instead of the perpetual blackness and skull-ridden world of James Cameron.  Maybe it's the lack of emotive or relatable music short of the five-beat drum pattern synonymous with the Terminator series.  The whole thing feels, well, like someone did a Terminator movie just to do a Terminator movie.<br /> Those willing to overlook these nuances, though, are in for a treat.

He acts his tail off, but I can't help but feel that he was brought on board for \\"star power.\\"  Maybe it's McG's illustration of the state of the planet; post-Judgement Day is that of a desert wasteland, akin to the most recent movie outages of Resident Evil and Final Fantasy instead of the perpetual blackness and skull-ridden world of James Cameron.  Maybe it's the lack of emotive or relatable music short of the five-beat drum pattern synonymous with the Terminator series.  The whole thing feels, well, like someone did a Terminator movie just to do a Terminator movie.   Those willing to overlook these nuances, though, are in for a treat.

B000OPOAM0|5.0|The Termintor was one of the most ground breaking film of it's time, it also cemented the career of Arnold Swartzeneger during generations to come.    Linda Hamilton stars as Sarah Connor, a young woman who's innocence is robbed when an unstopable cyborg from the future is sent to kill her.    This is James Camerons work at it's finest and sets the stage for T-2  Judgement Day, T-3 Rise of the Machines, and the latest Terminator Salvation.
0307266303|5.0|Don't be fooled,this is a great read whether you are a runner or not.  The richness of the characters and the drama of the storytelling reels you in like M&Ms at an aid station at mile 23.  I read this book over the weekend and found myself wanting to skip work on Monday and go for a long run.  Chris McDougall obviously is a gifted writer, but what makes this book different is his enmeshment into the story.  You finish feeling a part of Caballo, Jenn, Bonehead, Eric, Luis, Barefoot and all the Tarahumara, and I can't help but feel that is what the author wanted to accomplish.  The only problem now is scouring the net to get pictures to go with the names of all my new running buddies!  Get this book, you will not be disappointed.

1400049628|5.0|I'm a big Zombie fan. This book is the perfect guide for any Zombie fan.<br />It starts with descriptions, what a zombie looks like, how they acts, different characteristics. And then how the Zombie virus started, the author tried to explain how the Zombie virus came about to existence in a scientific way. The book talks about what to do and what not to do, the different weapons that could be used in fighting off zombie hordes. And there was even a brief look into history that involved \\"zombie encounters\\" in places like Egypt. Very interesting and very entertaining. A zombie fanatic must have.
1439157383|1.0|Thirteen-year old Anna, conceived by her parents in a petri dish and biologically engineered to be a perfect genetic match for her older sister, Kate, who has a rare form of cancer, is suing for \\"medical emancipation\\" in order to gain control of her own body.  After years of painful blood and bone marrow donations, Anna finally puts her foot down and hires an attorney when her mother demands one of Anna's kidneys for the dying sixteen-year old Kate.<br /><br />Some of the ethical issues raised by this novel could have been really interesting, poignant and dramatic in capable hands.  But this author comes across as so indulgent and pleased with her own voice as a writer that she has created a flatulent, overblown 400-page melodramatic soap opera instead of a tight, well-written, well-reasoned novel.  The book is not only cheap and cheesy -- it's insultingly unbelievable and ill-imagined.  Picoult owes an apology to those people (doctors, lawyers, patients and donors) who really have to deal with these sensitive issues.<br /><br />Obviously trying (and NOT succeeding) to emulate William Styron, Picoult creates a myriad of subplots and minor characters which detract from her main story line, and also manage to insult the reader's intelligence.  What adult in today's society doesn't know that there are service dogs who do more than guide blind people?  I certainly don't know anyone that uninformed, or unsophisticated.  But this author keeps up a running unfunny \\"joke\\" throughout the book about Anna's lawyer and his constant need to explain to people that he is not blind just because he needs a service dog.  What family court judge in ANY circumstance (and I am married to a judge, so I asked) would allow a mother to be opposing counsel to her own daughter in a court case?  None!  The conflict of interest issues stagger the mind.<br /><br />I think what I am most angry about in reading this book is my reason for reading it in the first place.  My daughter is attending a university in the fall -- a major university, mind you -- and this piece of trash is the \\"Freshman Experience\\" book which all the incoming class is assigned to read for discussion in English and Sociology survey classes.  I am livid that the English department at a major state university chose this book to force upon young minds.  Last year's incoming class got Jeanette Walls' masterful \\"The Glass Castle\\", and my child has to read the equivalent of a month's story arc on \\"All My Children.\\"<br /><br />This book is not literature.

From what i have read, i have to imagine most of the influence on the writing was of a religious basis. This is really too bad.

B001KVZ6FM|4.0|Pixar can do no wrong and UP is probably one of my favorites from them. The visuals are beautiful, the characters are interesting and it features quite a unique story. Pixar knows how to balance scenes of true emotion and those full of humor and action like no other. I actually found myself liking this one more than Wall-E. I should also mention the short film, Partly Cloudy, which is shown before the movie. It's funny, pretty to look at and is just a clever idea. If you got some young ones around, take them to see UP and you will both end up having a great time.
0316010669|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Malcolm Gladwell's. I have previously read Tipping Point and Outliers.    This is a fascinating book about how people make decisions. Using many psychological, sociological, and educational research studies, as well as personal experience and anecdotes, Gladwell gives many examples of how people reach conclusions and decisions.    This is, again, a book that as I was reading it I was discussing it with other people. I can't wait till Gladwell's next book. This guy is brilliant.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is one of those rare animated movies that should delight adults and children alike. The animation is terrific of course but beyond that the creators offer a thought-provoking story that is both funny and sad. Was there ever a hero as valiant and brave, dedicated and appealing as Wall-e, the little tractor that could?<br />The early scenes of a post-apocalyptic New York City are brilliant. Then the scene shifts to the spaceship where humans now live.<br />I don't want to get too deep but I found the satirical vision of these obese humans stuck in their seats, allowing computers to do everything for them, a little too close to reality.<br />Perversely, it's left to the robots to teach humans how to love -- how to be human.<br />Great movie!

B001U0HBPG|3.0|How many renditions of miracle person overcomes struggle after fantastic struggle, only to triumph and be heartbroken by love can there be?  I can think of two right off--\\"Button\\" and \\"Forest Gump\\"--it's formulaic equivalent.  Complete with 'troubled childhood in the sultry south inspires world travel coupled with insurmountable challenges and insightful life experiences, only to end up faced with a love he can't have', Button's is almost exactly the same story as Gump's.  If you can suspend that obvious plot doppelganger, the performances are great, the special effects are intriguing, and the film itself is lovely to look at.  Just accept that from the beginning you already know how it's going to go.

032147404X|4.0|As a novice photographer, I wanted to supplement my learning by purchasing this book along side both of Bryan Peterson's offerings. It is very easy to read and much of what's shared is practical.    I have to be honest though, I got extremely annoyed with the sarcastic humor. I found much of it insulting to the reader.    Other than that, I think a lot of his tips should help to clear up the mystique of mastering my dslr and simply shoot impressive photos. As a beginner photographer, I still believe that this book is a must have in a photographer's library, if nothing but for reference from time to time.

0756405890|5.0|I would take this moment to reflect on various points in the book but I'd rather just goad you into reading it for yourself. I'd love to say that I knew who Patrick Rothfuss was all along and was desperately awaiting the release of Name Of The Wind. The truth is that someone at Barnes and Noble practically forced the book on me while I was searching for another fantasy title. I thanked her, smiled then walked away. All the while I'd planned on dropping the book off somewhere inconspicuous but something told me that any book that sparked enough passion in a stranger to 'book rape' me was probably worth taking a peek at. The stranger was right! AMAZING! I've found myself pacing around pining away for book two. I went to the author's page and tried to learn more about him. I found myself a huge fan before I was a quarter of the way through. Patrick Rothfuss is as consistent and enamoring as Kvothe (main character in NOTW). This book will make you believe in magic (sympathy) the way you did when you were 8 years old... or maybe you still do. Not for me to judge my friend. I will say this: if you haven't picked up a copy of Name Of The Wind, punch yourself in the eye. You will love it... reading the book, that is. Thank you again Mr. Rothfuss! Please never stop writing.

It's a handgun and she blows her own head off when Reacher confronts her.<br /><br />\\" `I think you tipped her over the edge,' \\" says Theresa Lee, the cop who conducts the investigation afterwards. Lee apologizes for the remark but it sticks with him as several sets of other investigators - shady and official - prod him for information and he discovers that the dead woman worked in an innocuous government job.<br /><br />Everyone involved - from the FBI on down - seems to fob Reacher off with falsehoods and spin and nothing quite spur's Reacher's need to know like a lie. As he digs he turns up connections that go deep into a Senate candidate's distinguished and secretive military career, an Afghani widow's tragic story, and her beautiful daughter's quest for justice.<br /><br />If flattery won't get him, then bullets will seems to be the mantra of the various human obstacles in Reacher's path as he doggedly, dazzlingly works out complex, top-secret plots and histories and then patiently, cleverly goes up against overwhelming odds, with little more than Theresa Lee as a hamstrung aide.<br /><br />A snappy, cunning, diabolical plot master with an engaging stand-up individualist as a hero, Child has given us another top-notch, page-turning winner of a thriller.
B0015XHP4K|5.0|I had only seen the Rambo films a few times on commercial filled TV, so I truly enjoyed this experience on blu-ray. The price was just right, 29.99 at the time of this review. I was also surprised to see how good the picture looked even though the movies were filmed 20 years ago. Very little noticeable grain, even in 1080P. Each film included a decent amount of extras, commentary and trivia games. This collectors set would make a great gift or a good starter for a blu-ray collection.

The stop-motion animation is outstanding and very realistic looking.<br /><br />Ebert said \\"the effects are not up to modern standards\\"???  Huh?  I strongly disagree.  Compare this to Indiana Jones 4, I Am Legend, The Mist, Anaconda, or any of the new CGI footage inserted in the original Star Wars trilogy.  It's not even close.<br /><br />Now, the recent King Kong adaptation did have some remarkable computer effects.  But this original, filmed in glorious black & white, harnessed a certain energy that was much more ferocious and primeval.  There is no drawn out buildup to the action.  No cute little ice skating scene.  No Jack Black/comedic elements.  Oh no no NO!  This is no friendly, oversized gorilla.  This is KONG, the 8th Wonder of the World.<br /><br />It doesn't get any better than this.

0393324818|3.0|In the mid-1990s, the owners of the Oakland Athletics slashed their payroll.  Their past GM, Sandy Alderson, decided that he needed to build talent from within.  Four first rank players emerged from this effort, three infielders and one pitcher.  In the late 1990s, new GM Billy Beane continued this effort and developed two more first rank pitchers.  The \\"Big Three\\" pitchers and the three infielders created the nucleus of a team that - despite its low payroll - won a lot of games.<br /><br />In the mid-2000s, all but one of those six players left the A's because of salary considerations. The effort to build from within hasn't yielded the successes of the 1990s.  The team now loses a lot of games.<br /><br />That's the story of the A's in a nutshell.  The moral of this story is that if a team can get lucky it can build from within for a few years and win.  But eventually, the team has to pay out the money to players.  It's not much of a story unless you're a baseball fan.  I am.<br /><br />Mr. Lewis, who is a good writer, took this basic story and embellished it with a myth.  The A's supposedly had a magic formula for success.  They found players that others didn't because they used an unusual methodology.  The A's GM Billy Beane was elevated to the level of a genius.<br /><br />The thesis for this book is just plain wrong.  It's entertaining to read, but it belies facts.<br /><br />The book focuses on the annual draft in 2002 when the A's were able to pick 7 out of the first 39 players.  Supposedly, the A's unusual methods would have yielded both easy to spot gems and diamonds in the rough.  They didn't.  The draft eventually produced one second rank pitcher, one second rank outfielder, and one middle-talent infielder, none of whom play for the A's.  The A's methods at finding young talent have been, as of late, not particularly good.<br /><br />It was a good thing that this book came out when the A's were winning.  It was the equivalent of writing a story about a craps player with a \\"method\\" who has an unusual run of good luck.  If all goes well, the story comes out before the luck runs out.  That's what happened here.  But in hindsight, this book looks just plain silly.aps player with a \\"method\\" who has an unusual run of good luck.

055380684X|4.0|\\"I'm going to practice it a zillion million times,\\" she said. \\"I'm going to play super good.\\"    \\"The Talent Code\\" by Daniel Coyle is a book on how to grow talent. The author is against the wisdom that talent is natural. The book is around the belief that talent come from Myelin. Myelin is the \\"insulation that wrap these nerve fibers and increases signal strength, speed, and accuracy.\\" When the certain signal is sent down the nerve system, myelin wraps around the nerve fibre. The thicker the myelin, the better the signal. Thus, \\"skill is myelin insulation that wraps neural circuits and that grows according to certain signals.\\"    The book is divided into three parts of talent growing; 1. Deep Practice 2. Ignition 3. Master Coaching    Contents    Part 1: Deep Practice    Chapter 1: The Sweet Spot  This is the first chapter to familiarise us with the deep practice. Coyle wrote about Brazilian football (soccer) and why it is the world's talent hotbed. He had an amazing story of Edwin Link and how his unusual device transformed the training of the Air Force.    Chapter 2: The Deep Practice Cell  This chapter surrounds the idea of myelin and how it might be the holy grail to talent. It is very scientific. To sum it up, \\"deep practice x 10,000 hours = world-class skill.\\"    Chapter 3: The Brontës, the Z-Boys, and the Renaissance  The author started with the Brontë sisters from England in the 1850s who wrote fantastic children books. He also wrote about the group of skaters by the name of Z-Boys and the guilds during the renaissance and how they produced highly talented people.    Chapter 4: The Three Rules of Deep Practice  This chapter, Coyle gives us three rules of Deep Practicing. 1. Chunk It Up 2. Repeat It 3. Learn to Feel It  Part 2: Ignition    Chapter 5: Prima Cues  It is merely things that get you interested, that excite you and bring you passion. Coyle wrote on how the success of Se Ri Pak, a Korean golfer, had an impact on the next generation of female Korean golfers and how young Russian tennis players wanted to be the new Anna. \\"If she can do it, why can't I?\\"    Chapter 6: The Curaçao Experiment  The remote Caribbean island, Curaçao, did a miraculous work at producing lots of talented baseball players because the ignition sparked when an island hero, Andruw Jones, hit a home run. However, the real success of Curaçao is that it keeps motivational fire lit, Doyle tells you how they did it.    Chapter 7: How to Ignite a Hotbed  This chapter is about KIPP (Knowledge Is Power Program) by Mike Feinberg and Dave Levin. The story of success of KIPP is like a miracle but the core of it is to constantly ignite the students with just a word, college. No,... \\"COLLEGE!!\\"    Part 3: Master Coaching    Chapter 8: The Talent Whisperers  Talent does not come alone, the talented people in their fields need a coach, a mentor, or a master. Coyle wrote about Herman Lamm, the originator and teacher of modern bank-robbing skill! He wrote about Hans Jansen, a cello teacher at Meadowmount Music School in Chicago and how he personalised his teaching method. There is also a wonderful story of John Wooden, a great basketball coach and his amazing coaching techniques.    Chapter 9: The Teaching Blueprint  The author elaborated the four virtues of teaching 1. The Matrix or a task-specific knowledge of the teacher (He wrote a nice story of Linda Septein who taught Jessica Simpson and Beyonce Knowles) 2. Perceptiveness - how to perceive students individually 3. The GPS Reflex - the just-in-time informative directives 4. Theatrical Honesty which is the ability to connect with students.    Chapter 10: Tom Martinez and the $60 Million Bet  This is a chapter about Tom Martinez, a retired junior college American football coach, and his teaching method on a promising young quarterback, JaMarcus Russell.    ...    I would like to compare this book to an ideal book: a book that is easy to understand, distinct, practical, credible, insightful, and provides great reading experience.    Ease of Understanding: 8/10: The book is written in simple language albeit some scientific information. The structure is very simple with the three parts, Deep Practice, Ignition, and Master Coaching. Minor drawbacks are some uses of unnecessary ambiguous words such as Matrix, Threatrical Honesty, etc. but they are minor, though.    Distinction: 7/10: There are many books on this subject already and it reminds me of a recent book, \\"Outliers\\" by Malcolm Gladwell and the two have some similarities and some differences. However, The Talent Code is excellent at instilling the knowledge of Myelin making us view talent from a different perspective.    Practicality: 8/10: This book is practical especially in the field on Deep Practice. Daniel Coyle explained nicely on this issue and it is not difficult to implement it to our daily life. Chunk It Up, Repeat, and Learn to Feel It are pretty much straightforward and Deep Practice is the best part of the book because the other two, Ignition and Master Coaching are more difficult to implement.    Credibility: 3/10: Although this is a very good book, it has a major flaw. This book is like a qualitative research. It is deep in the subject and in the examples and stories in the book. However, it lacks generalisation. You might say \\"That's the way it is\\" to a story but that might not be the way the rest are. There are some contradictions in the book as well.    For example, in the Chapter 9, the author stated that teaching soccer is different from teaching violin. Teaching soccer must be free flowing because the soccer circuitry is \\"varied and fast, changing fluidly in response to each obstacle.\\" So, the coach rather lets the players perform. On the other hand, the violinist has to be accurate, precise, and stable. The coach, thus, has to stop and make sure that the circuitry is correct.    The argument is convincing and sensible until we noticed the way the legendary John Wooden, a basketball coach, coached. It's undisputed that basketball is more similar to soccer than violin that it requires fluidity in the game but Coyle wrote that John Wooden constantly issuing informative corrections of movements to players. He might not stop the game but he surely keeps correcting players, not letting them flow. Coyle wrote \\"[The soccer coach] occasionally smiles ot laughs or says oooooooo for a close play as a fan would. But he doesn't coach in the regular sense of the term, which is to say he doesn't stop the game, teach, praise, critique, or otherwise exert any control whatsoever.\\"    There are some other contradictions or, at least, an overlap. In the chapter 8, Coyle wrote that some coaches coach love or make the children love what they are doing. The quote from the research of Dr. Benjamin Bloom in the chapter is \\"Perhaps the major quality of these teachers was that they made the initial learning very pleasant and rewarding. Much of the introduction to the field was a playful activity, and the learning at the beginning of the stage was much like a game.\\"    However, in chapter 7, regarding KIPP, the process is not really similar, if not opposite. The new students will be introduced to \\"discipline\\" from the first day on everything; how to walk, how to talk, how to sit at a desk, how to look at a teacher or classmate who's speaking, and so on. Students, on the first day, sat on the floor without a desk because \\"...everything here at KIPP is earned. EVERYTHING is earned. Everything is EARNED.\\" This is a much tougher game than the piano class in Dr. Bloom's research. Likewise, at Spartak, the tennis hotbed in Russia, they did not \\"play\\" tennis - they preferred the verb borot'sya - \\"fight\\" or \\"struggle.\\"    There are many minor contradictions and overlaps in this book and make it much less convincing and credible and much of them are in the parts of \\"Ignition\\" and \\"Master Coaching.\\"    Insightful: 7/10: Daniel Coyle had done a very good work with his interviews in theso-called talent hotbeds around the world. Those examples are backed with stories from those involved. However, more researches with less depth would be great to confirm the findings of the deep and insightful ones.    Reading Experience: 6/10: At first, this book is very promising with the first part, \\"Deep Practice.\\" It gives you intriguing knowledge and very practical methods. However, the book fades out in the later parts I discussed above. While the \\"Deep Practice\\" part is very scientific, the other parts are not as solid. The general theme of the whole book is nice but the contradictions can frustrate you.    Overall: 6.5/10: This is a good book with a different perspective on how we look at talent. It will provide you with inspiration and sufficient guidelines to make you more talented in your fields. The Deep Practice part of the book is simply invaluable. The other two parts are not bad but some unclear messages might hold you back.    (I have done this kind of review for some months; if any of you have a comment or suggestion, please do tell)
0345479092|5.0|I skimmed a few other newborn advice books, and found them too extreme. Tracy Hogg's approach (if not voice, \\"luv\\") was the most in tune with my natural instincts about parenting - that babies prefer a routine (not a schedule) - and gives you practical advice on how to set a course for your baby. My experience is that when I get a little off-course with my now 6-month old twin boys, I skim the appropriate chapter in the book and we all get back on track. My twins both had different personalities - one is an Angel or a Textbook baby, and the other is more of a Touchy baby - and her techniques are working for both of the babies. Within eight weeks of bringing my premature sons home from NICU, they were sleeping for 6-hour stretches at night, and within 12 weeks they started sleeping 10-12 hours at night, all because of the tips that I gleaned from this book. Learning to distinguish my babies' cries and responding appropriately has critical to my success. I recommend this book to all my new mother friends.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth is an absolutely beautiful series.  The amount of work and hardships faced during its creation is truly admirable.  You get to see a taste of it here though it does not detract from the series itself as they separate the \\"making of\\" sections into clips at the end of each episode and on the bonus DVD.     The series is set up interestingly as well.  The first episode is a general overview - \\"Pole to Pole\\" as they call it, and it is followed by episodes which each cover a specific type of ecosystem (caves, seasonal forests, deserts, etc.)    My only criticism, if I had to have one, would be that I wish they'd had more time to go into more species of plants and wildlife, though they did select the ones they did for a reason (as they explain in greater detail on the bonus DVD.)      Really stunning - I recommend it to everyone.

B000002KIE|5.0|OK, so the hook is a little off the wall, but this album came out during the peak of disco and all the 70's crap that served as 'rock music'.  This album was the BEGINNING of 'new wave' or 'punk'(as it was later called) and it was cutting edge for its time.  I remember hearing 'Pretty Vacant' on a college radio station before the album was released and I was so moved by the chord progressions, the energy, and the force of the music that I kept checking a couple times a week at the local record store for the release.  It finally was released and I purchased the album the next day.  It is classic.  It IS classic.  Most everything you heard from 1977 until 2009 was influenced in some way, great or small, by this album.
1582701709|1.0|This material is as old as the hills, though some of it IS very useful. I would suggest you read 3 Magic Words, (also available on Amazon) written in 1952 by U. S. Aunderson. Many of the passages in this book look suspiciously like exact extracts from his book with a slight rearrangement of the words.    Again, let me stress, positive thinking IS a fine thing but when your health goes south in a serious way, go to a doctor or the only thing you're going to be attracting is an undertaker. I found that out the hard way!    I recommend you buy 3 Magic Words instead. As a side bonus, that book gives you the only plausible explanation I've heard of what God may be like or doing with the Universe -- just a theoretical concept not a religion -- but it has the extra bonus of curing you of Christianity (if you need it, which I didn't) as he thoroughly and simply debunks the concepts of heaven and hell and a loving God overseeing a world full of misery and suffering.     I suggest reading it when you need it, when you've bottomed out, and are willing to pay attention to his philosophy and trying his interesting 30-day mental diet-- an incredibly simple exercise that turns out to be extremely difficult to do.
1427200882|5.0|The book has an unfortunate title, as it belies the quality of content.<br /><br />Naomi Klein's discourse (in audio- or paperback) could be subsumed under the subject matter of Neoliberalism, which is explained most excellently by David Harvey in his book \\"A Brief History of Neoliberalism\\" (ISBN: 0199283273). He explains the causations of the doctrine and its development in the last century (he mentions \\"the Chicago Boys\\"), and its relevance (and more) to the current century. This book and another, Web of Debt (ISBN: 0979560829), complement each other. If readers read both books and correlate the information, they will see greed reflected in history on a grand scale.<br /><br />Naomi Klein's discourse on \\"disaster capitalism\\" is a sensational expos&eacute; of \\"Neoliberalism\\" in action brought about through the events of violent \\"capital colonization\\" (not human colonization, but by violent natural causes or human intervention) of so-called developing countries by imperial capitalist countries (such the EU, USA, and Britain). Zimbabwe is an example of an apparent exception, because it has been undergoing \\"capital decolonisation\\", but this is actually an example of violent (internal) human intervention, which makes it a prime target for imperial capital colonization later in history. (Watch out to see if I am correct in forecasting this event)<br /><br />The economist John Maynard Keynes (1883 - 1946) once said: \\"The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood.

B0002ZDVEU|4.0|It would seem that the reason this sequel was made as it was is that the inner spring of the Agency's deceit was not revealed in the initial release.  And so, rather than pile on the fight sequences, the producer/director decided to (yes, pile on the fight sequences, but) dive into the villany of Bourne's predicament.  And its simply this: the USA for some reason, wanted to wire either 3 million or 3 billion dollars in aid to Russia, and it was stolen en transit.  The theft was engineered by a corrupt member of Russian Intelligence, working with two corrupt CIA officials.  The three split the money and faked the theft by cloaking it in a CIA assassionation by a new operator, Bourne.  His fingerprints were stolen to be used later as false proof of his involvement, and his memory and/or identity snapped or malfunctioned.  We can't be sure how, but it appears to have been a reaction to his home agency's guilt in not only the murder of the Russian businessman and his wife, but in its willingness to sacrifice personnel so that the CIA thieves could keep not only their stolen wealth, but their positions and perks in the Agency.    Not an easy skein to unwind at any speed, but seemingly impossible at the speed required to match Bourne's life as an international fugitive.    True, one of the two corrupt CIA officials was killed at the end of the original story, but as we learn, the survivor, in order to protect himself from the hidden but questionable file involving himself, has to use his contacts with the KGB to eliminate Bourne.  That Avening Angel with Carl Urban's raptor face, like the hero in Prokoffiev's opera of that name, seeks out Bourne and his lover in Beach resort Goa, and kills her with a sniper's long range rifle, believing he's killed him.  Then he's off to Russia never to be seen again, presumably.    She is shot behind the wheel of a 4X4 as it crashes through a guard rail and plunges into the water below, and the underwater sequence in which Bourne tried both to save the dead and/or dying woman and then to reposition her in the vehicle inspired, it seems to me, Daniel Craig's very similar attempt in CASINO ROYALE to save drowning Eva Green who's trapped in a metal elevator cage that is sinking into a Venedian canal.  The intensity; the despair of love and sensuality irretrevably lost.  Its all there.  And then the movie gears up into Bourne's Revenge Mode.  And it doesn't slow down.  Bourne becomes, his humanity nearaly burnt away, like the edge of ALLAH's sword, Justice, which no man can evade, fortell or delay.    At Headquarters we see faces we remember from the initial show, and replacing the corrupt Management Operative who was taken out, we find Joan Allen as Langley's on-the-spot Inquirer, re-opening the Bourne file and searching through whatever evidence remains to find out not just who, but why.  Good performance.  But how unexpected: to play the character as the femenine side of Ann Coulter!    Well, there are chase sequences throughout Europe -- all thrilling and ingeneous -- and finally, in Moscow, Bourne -- piloting an old RussoFiat Taxi like a maniac -- manages to get his lover's killer, and we get a keen sort of sensual fulfillment looking at dead Urban's face, the top of his bloody head blown away.    Personally, I find this feature to be extremely rewarding and entertaining, but I think the best way to watch it is not as a sequal to the first film, but as the second part or reel of that story.  Just watch it without interruption and any sense of dislocation of narrative tissue will be lost.  Instead, the Bourne experience will be heightened.  Which is amazing, even to contemplate in the abstract!

B00005JLWN|5.0|I love this movie.  Love it.  It reminds me of the older sci-fi movies like Soylent Green, Rollerball (the original with James Caan), Logan's Run, Silent Running ... or even the more modern Demolition Man.    Sci-fi with a message.  Fortunately for us, this one manages to cram a lot of gunfire in with that message.    Some reviewers have compared this movie to The Matrix.  The are, simply, wrong.  There are brooding heroes in both.  That's about where the similarities stop.      Equilibrium is a pleasant meld of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451.  In the future, feelings are considered bad.  Feelings lead us to war, crime, and that which we can no longer tolerate.    So, a drug is created: Equilibrium.  Taken twice a day, all citizens are required to take it.  To not take it is a crime apparently punishable by death.    To go with the drug, all things that might cause one to feel are outlawed, classified EC-10.  Our main character, Bale, is part of the police-like force, called Grammaton Clerics, that are tasked with eradicating all things that elicit feelings.    Naturally, there are folks who dislike this.  They like to feel.  They want to feel.  They need to feel.  They are the rebels.  These rebels hoard items of art, perfumes, music, books.    The movie is about Bale's character, Preston, and his journey from unfeeling, lethal enforcer for a very dull and oppressive government ... to sense criminal and last hope of humanity.    I do see a lot of 1984 in this movie.  The imagery is drab, we see children enlisted to spot feelers and turn in their parents, we have a \\"benevolent\\" leader known as Father.    This is mixed with the very basic premise of Fahrenheit 451: the Grammaton Clerics are tasked with destroying anything that results in feeling.  Unlike their F451 counterparts, the firemen, the Grammaton Clerics are also tasked with killing anyone who feels.    All this, and the movie was done on a tiny budget in Eastern Europe.  Great, great fun.
B000VSBX34|5.0|I hadn't seen the Beatles' Help! movie in a long, long time, let alone the 2007 premastered version. Well, I picked this up recently, and boy, am I glad I did. The 2007 reissue is a 2 DVD set.<br /><br />DVD 1 of \\"Help!\\" (95 min.) brings the original movie (released in 1965), and what a delight it is to see it again after all this years. It doesn't have the original charm and innocence of 1964's \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", but that is not a surprise as at that time the Beatles were battling the peak of Beatlemania. Director Richard Lestor somehow manages the 4 guys through a zany script (something about a chase for a ring on Ringo's finger, not that it matters a whole lot). The movie is just a pretense to showcase the Beatles in any way, shape or form. The way the songs are presented in the movie became, what is clear by now, a model on how to shoot interesting music videos (as is acknowledged in the second DVD, more on that later). The songs play fabulously if you have the proper home-theatre set-up (which I have). To think that this movie is now 44 years old just boggles the mind. It still feels fresh to this day.<br /><br />DVD 2 (60 min.) brings mostly a recollection of those who were involved in the movie at that time, and it is a delight to hear these people (including the director, but also many others) recollecting on the insaneness that it was to shoot a film with the Beatles. Lester tells a funny anecdote that he received an award from MTV for being the father of music videos and he says \\"I want a blood test\\", haha! It also includes a look on how the movie was \\"remastered\\" (with spectacular results, by the way) and several trailers for the movie, including one in Spanish for \\"Los Beatles\\", just hilarious.<br /><br />In all, this is a must have for Beatles fans, and by now also a great historical time-capsule of things in the mid-60s. Highly recommended!
B0010X745K|5.0|There are a lot of well written, in depth reviews of this film already here.  I just wanted to chime in and say that it met my ultimate criteria: it held my interest and made me care about what happened next.  I agree there were no clever plot twists, but the acting of every single person was so committed and realistic that I couldn't stop watching.  This was one of those flicks where a friend just put it on and said \\"Let's watch this, I think you might like it\\", and he was absolutely right.  I think it probably helped that I knew nothing about it before he popped it in.  I did not expect the ending, but I agree that it worked.  All in all, a good story, well told, with superior supporting acting.
B000002KOQ|5.0|This was Jon's third album and followed on from Clouds, the album that featured Joni's own versions of Both sides now and Chelsea morning. Expectations for this album were probably quite high in anticipation of its release. Such expectations were fully justified as Joni moved away from her folk roots just a little by use of a slightly fuller musical backing, especially the addition of a piano. I love the sparse backing that Joni used on Song to a seagull and Clouds, but I'm in a minority in liking folk music recorded that way. I suspect that most people welcomed the slight change in style here. It's still easily recognizable as folk music, something that cannot be said of Joni's albums from the mid-seventies onwards, though I also love those albums but in a different way.<br /><br />The songs here are outstanding. The opening track, Morning Morgantown, paints a great picture of everyday urban life in the morning. In the next song, Joni expresses feelings of guilt about being paid for singing, contrasting her situation with that of a street musician playing his clarinet for free. Many more classic songs follow but I'll just mention the last three tracks.<br /><br />Joni wrote Woodstock, which later became a British number one hit via a cover by Matthews Southern Comfort, despite not actually playing the famous event there. Big yellow taxi, the single lifted from the album, provided Joni with her only major British hit single, just missing the top ten. It's a great song that seems more relevant now than it did in 1970, commenting on the way in which much of the natural world is destroyed for developments of one kind or another. The album closes with Circle game, a great song about how life just goes round and round.<br /><br />Joni recorded many great albums of varying musical styles, but this one certainly rates among her best as far as I'm concerned.

B001KMB6YG|3.0|Babylon A.D. / B001KMB6YG<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />I'm not really sure what happened here. Vin Diesel does mindless action, and does it well, and here is no exception - whatever flaws \\"Babylon A.D.\\" has, they are not his fault. Nor are they the fault of Michelle Yeoh who carries herself (as always) superbly, leaving the viewer to wonder why, exactly, Yeoh keeps showing up in particularly flat action movies ([[ASIN:B001HQZJMU The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]] leaps to mind) when she really is so much better than that and has proven it time and time again. Either there's still some kind of \\"White Actresses Only\\" rule barring Yeoh from the better movies, or she has a really terrible agent. Anyway.<br /><br />Sometimes you can just tell when a movie is based off of a science fiction story you haven't been exposed to. \\"Babylon A.D.\\" is definitely one of those movies - sure enough, the opening credits note a sci-fi story that may or may not be obscure, but which I definitely haven't read yet. A lot of the standard sci-fi fare is here: much of the world's animals have died out, and have been replaced by clones; America is a closed-borders super-power where a high standard of living is possible for the wealthy, but the rest of the world flounders in deep poverty and warfare; genetic modification of humans is the way to the future. Etc.<br /><br />Into all this steps Vin Diesel, a conscientious mercenary given a second chance to re-enter America, if only he will deliver a sheltered teenager (and her adoptive mother, Yeoh) along the way. Vin Diesel is only too happy to comply, although he is understandably spooked by the sleepy-eyed girl he's been given charge of. When the girl starts displaying uncanny abilities, such as a near-psychic understanding of the immediate future, an ability to speak multiple languages fluently, and intimate knowledge of the controls of a derelict submarine, he recognizes that there's something a bit off about the young lady and - suspects - that she might be carrying a terrorist-created virus. If so, he vows to murder the girl before she can be 'activated', although this doesn't make much sense because (mind you, I'm not a biologist) it seems like that wouldn't necessarily neutralize the danger.<br /><br />Anyway, that doesn't matter, because it turns out the girl is *really* a genetically modified human with 'the brain of a computer' and she's been impregnated with twins (apparently during a brief doctor's visit prior to the start of the movie) who are 'powerful' even in the womb, yet in a completely undefined sense. The girl's \\"mother\\" - the leader of a cult who commissioned her birth in the hope that this new messiah/madonna would bring in a few more converts - plans to kidnap the girl and...well, it's not exactly clear what she plans to do with her. Use her as a P.R. device, apparently, but it's not clear why Vin Diesel feels compelled to save her from this fate. For that matter, it's exceedingly creepy to see the young lady come on to Vin Diesel, given that he's getting at that age where he could probably be her father and, besides, his entire role in the movie up to her attempted seduction is a paternal one, not a romantic one. It would seem that Hollywood no longer knows how to portray a Man and a Woman without insisting that they \\"Find Twue Luv\\".<br /><br />Despite serious differences in age and genetics, Vin Diesel realizes that he does love the girl and saves her from a non-specific fate that might be bad, but might not be. And then, because the movie was getting a bit longish, we immediately jump to the epilogue where we find that our Computer-Brain Girl was only designed to bear children and nothing more (why? how?) and she has spent the entire pregnancy in a coma (which we all know is just wonderful for fetal development, good grief), and once she delivers (in the quietest delivery ever), she will die and leave the infants in Vin Diesel's capable hands, where he will protect them from...what? Being used for evil, perhaps, although it's unclear how the children could be useful for anything more than the average human baby. This is left out, however, either because they were hoping for a sequel or - more likely - because they ran out of budget.<br /><br />\\"Babylon A.D\\" suffers simultaneously from too much exposition and not enough of it. Huge swaths of dialogue are devoted to heart-to-heart conversations between Vin Diesel and Yeoh while they hash out that the girl is really super special and important - really! - without the viewer ever understanding *why* the girl is useful nor *why* her children are important or powerful or even where they came from. The result is that there is far too little mindless action (because we have to talk about Special! Computer! Girl!) for this to be a proper action flick, and yet far too little pertinent exposition for this to be a proper science fiction film. Since much of the movie feels sloppy and poorly edited, I expect that the whole thing was filmed with a proper amount of action and exposition and then someone with poor editing kung fu took out the relevant dialogue and left in the moody, introspective stuff.<br /><br />It is possible that familiarity with the source material is just a necessity for proper viewing of this movie, however, I tend to feel that a movie should be able to stand on its own without needing \\"pre-reading\\" on the part of the viewer. In that sense, \\"Babylon A.D.\\" fails, and I don't particularly recommend it as anything more than a mindless adult-protects-precocious-child-through-scifi-explosions movie, and if you want to watch something like that, at least [[ASIN:B000FGGE68 Ultraviolet]] has vampires.

1400082773|4.0|If you want to know how our President lived and what made him tick and what his journey of discovering himself was like before he became a politician, this book is the best.  The good news for all America is that he's a brilliant man, a deep thinker, and a great writer and it comes through in this memoir of a bi-racial boy and man coming to terms with his racial and cultural heritage.  Despite being raised in a mostly white environment in Hawaii and then an Indonesian environment in that country when his mother marries a native of that land, this book gives short shrift to those influences as he understandably searches for the African heritage he did not grow up with.  Still I would have liked to have seen him give more credit to those who raised him and his bi-racial heritage, although it is our historically racist American society that wanted to pigeon-hole a bi-racial child into the black racial category.  For example, about a quarter of the book dwells on his adventure to Kenya where he met the family on his father's side and most of that covers then-current and past stories of this large extended family.  I don't recall him mentioning his white family beyond his mother and her parents.  I don't recall if he ever saw any of the cousins, aunts, and uncles on that side and if he didn't why not? He barely mentions his half-sister that he grew up with in Indonesia, but there are dozens of pages about a half-sister from Africa (he seems to have several such half-siblings) he didn't meet until he was an adult.  He was certainly affected by the militant black politics that was common on college campuses when he went to Occidental, but he was skeptical of the more strident rhetoric and his experience as a community organizer in Chicago which represents a large portion of the book brought him in touch with the tough intractable realities beyond the sloganeering. In many ways this is not unlike other coming of age stories and the man that comes out of it is a fine human being.  I would have liked more on his Hawaii/Indonesian youth, less on the community organizing. For a memoir, he sometimes spends too much time telling instead of showing (particularly in the community organizing part), but our now-President narrates time and place beautifully as he struggles to find his identity in the world.  And he knows how to weave a tapestry of fascinating stories into the man he became. If he had never become well known this would still be a very important and interesting book.  Because of who he is now, it's a must read.
B00000K3D4|4.0|Labyrinth / B00000K3D4<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />It seems like just last week I was reviewing [[ASIN:B000R8YC1I The Dark Crystal]] and hailing it as a timeless classic adventure, enjoyable for both children and adults. Having just also seen \\"Labyrinth\\", which is often packaged together with \\"The Dark Crystal\\", I have to say that, though I enjoyed \\"Labyrinth\\", it isn't a timeless classic for all ages in the way that \\"The Dark Crystal\\" is.<br /><br />In an ominous foretelling of Lucas' now much-lamented propensity to prefer attractive young actors/actresses as opposed to ones who are skilled at their craft, lead actress Connelly, seems ill at ease here, often pausing excessively long as her lines are (apparently) fed to her and providing the same blank expressionless face repeatedly. The scenes between her and the Goblin King (Bowie) are often charged with sexual tension that is, in my opinion, largely inappropriate, and can someone please explain why they felt the need to dress Bowie in skin-tight tights with an accompanying jutting cup in his nether region?<br /><br />Someone also felt the need to include music that can only be described as \\"very eighties\\" and while none of it is bad, one really does not make a \\"timeless classic\\" by slapping a music genre like this on it - an action which invariably dates it.<br /><br />Once you get past the over-sexualized, under-achieving Connelly and maintain eye-contact only with the suggestive Bowie, things improve. The labyrinth is intriguing and amusing, with its hidden doors, moving passageways, loose stones, and excessive traps. The theme is a little more specialized than some (saving a brother as opposed to saving the world), but is something that will resonate with children - particularly children with a younger sibling, I suspect. The supporting muppets are superb, with an over-sized Yeti (\\"Smells bad!\\"), a quixotic fox (riding an adorable doggie), and a troll who dares to hope that the lovely Connelly will be his friend in spite of his ugly face. (Again, though, this is a little creepy, with the troll receiving a much-anticipated spontaneous kiss from Connelly, albeit of the friendly 'on-the-cheek' variety.) And, of course, the crystal ball juggling featured throughout the movie has to be seen to be believed, along with a hallway mirroring the famous M.C. Escher stairwell painting.<br /><br />I don't regret watching \\"Labyrinth\\", and I think children may appreciate the movie for the bright colors and fun music, but definitely the movie is lacking the strong heroine, good acting, and overall appeal of \\"The Dark Crystal\\". I definitely would have liked the movie much better with a more decent actress and a lessening of the sexuality overtones that someone, I suspect Lucas, thought was a good idea to include.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollgain, though, this is a little creepy, with the troll receiving a much-anticipated spontaneous kiss from Connelly, albeit of the friendly 'on-the-cheek' variety.)

0226264211|4.0|I received Capitalism and Freedom as a gift from an admissions officer at the University of Chicago.  At the time, I was a 17 year-old kid in high school applying to U of C, which of course, is the University where Milton Friedman taught.  After several failed attempts to read it, I left the book to gather dust in my bookshelf for several years, and only recently picked it back up.  What I found is a book that I should have read many years ago.  Mr. Friedman's philosophy is essentially the philosophy of free-market advocates even today, almost fifty years after Capitalism and Freedom was first published.      The author provides a list of fourteen activities that the U.S. government was engaged in the early 1960's, and which it should immediately stop performing in order to allow the country to become a true Capitalist nation.  This list of activities includes trade restrictions, public education, and agricultural subsidies among others.  In fact, the later chapters of the book are mostly devoted to explaining why the American government should seize to perform the aforementioned activities.    I believe that the first two chapters are by far the most interesting and insightful in the book.  Here are a few of my thoughts on the first couple of chapters of Capitalism and Freedom:    Chapter 1 - Relation between Economic Freedom and Political Freedom  Friedman contends that the primary function of government in fiscal matters is to coordinate the economic activities of its citizens.  There are two fundamental methods in which a government can achieve this.  The first is through central direction, that is, through big government and/or military efforts.  The second, which is of course the more desirable of the two, is to identify and enforce the rules of engagement by private citizens in a free market.  Moreover, the latter method would allow individuals to acquire economic power (i.e. wealth), which in turn offsets political power.  It is this essential relationship between economic and political powers which allows for the maximum freedom of a nation and its people.      Chapter 2 - The Role of Government in a Free Society  In Chapter 2, the author further expands on the principles laid out in Chapter 1 and lays out perhaps the most insightful notion of the entire book, which is, that \\"...the role of the market...is that it permits unanimity without conformity.\\"  In essence, Friedman is arguing that only a free market, and not the government, allows individuals to achieve the maximum amount of freedom.  This is obviously an indispensable role in a society where freedom is the most desired quality of life value.    The remaining chapters in the book break down as follow:    Chapter 3 - The Control of Money  Chapter 4 - International Financial and Trade Arrangements  Chapter 5 - Fiscal Policy  Chapter 6 - The Role of Government in Education  Chapter 7 - Capitalism and Discrimination  Chapter 8 - Monopoly and the Social Responsibility of Business and Labor  Chapter 9 - Occupational Licensure  Chapter 10 - The Distribution of Income  Chapter 11 - Social Welfare Measures  \\"Humility is the distinguishing virtue of the believer in freedom; arrogance, of the paternalist.\\"  Chapter 12 - The Alleviation of Poverty  Chapter 13 - Conclusion    I do not give Capitalism and Freedom a rating of five stars, because of two major factors.  First, the book is definitely outdated to the point that it is hard to ignore in some chapters.  Moreover, as has been stated by other reviewers, Capitalism and Freedom does not go in depth on many of the key issues of interest in the book.   It appears that Mr. Friedman provides a more comprehensive evaluation in Free to Choose, but I have yet to read that book.      I do, however, rate the book as 4+ stars and recommend it as necessary reading to any person interested in Economics, Politics and/or Philosophy.  It is also a good book to read and own for the casual reader.
1416562605|5.0|The author, in his first novel here, highlights the slums and its people, and follows the life of a man, Balram, born to be the servant of the wealthy-a man whose status condemns him to being less than a man-and follows his life of servitude into liberation. Along the way, we are treated to illuminating vignettes, rich satirical comedy-in-tragedy, and carefully observed details that have the smack of truth.<br /><br />India's social reality is the subject of this book-her troubles,  inequalities, and social injustices. In fact, the tone of the book, and its use of language draw us into the slumdog world of the main character very effectively, and makes clear the distance between rich and poor.<br /><br />Balram's ambition to rise from his low position and life of indentured servitude gives us the title of the book-a person with such ambitions is a \\"White Tiger\\"-rare-special. It is the special ambition of Balram that weaves him through the first leap into becoming a driver for a wealthy family-then to establish himself by crushing his former boss.<br /><br />The details of the story are too rich to give away-there is corruption-and there are difficult passages that make one question the morality-who is right? Who is wrong?<br /><br />In conclusion is the system of injustice itself destroyed or perpetuated, with different clients and bosses? The controversial reception of the book suggests that these are not easily answered questions.
0891419195|5.0|As one of the Less-Than-5-Star raters said, there are a few parts of this book that are a little slow, mainly in the first third or so.  Aside from that, this is a book everyone should read to understand more about war.  Even the mundane events are somehow fascinating and his vivid depictions of the horrors of war are heartbreaking.  Read this book and you'll rush to hug a war veteran.  After you stop crying.
B00008RWRN|5.0|The music alone is well worth the $22--although cheaper versions do exist-- but where this version soars above all others is in the sound quality.  The sound quality is simply stunning.  I could go on, but just listen to the audio preview available on this product's main page.  While listening, keep this in mind:  the audio preview is only 1/10 the resolution of what is found on the Hybrid SACD.  And as good as the audio preview sounds, the Hybrid SACD sounds that much better.  Highly Recommended.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Great record!  The GZA throws down on this one.  It takes a little time to get used to, give it a few spins and then you'll start to get it.  Every song on \\"Liquid Swords\\" is a keeper.  No hits, no crossover stuff just pure hip-hop with one the top Mc's in the game.  It has a lot of guests on it but, it's done the right way. The record is all about the GZA, the guests don't take away from the record like most rap records.  Every song gets better and better as the record goes on.  I can't give this record enough credit. Just Awesome, beginning to end!!!
B001VB8UAE|5.0|My mother is a huge Barbra fan so I purchased this set for her for Mothers day and she was absolutely thrilled. Every time I go to see her the tv is set on volume 50 (the highest it will go). She loves every song and video from the set!

I know that Twlight is writen so the young adults can enjoy it, but I have to say that from book 1. (Twlight), book 2. (New Moon) that is going to be a Movie that's coming out in November 2009, book 3. (Eclipse) and then the 4th, you can not get enough. I love, the love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob, but your always in Edward's cornor.<br />The twist, and turns that goes with these charaters, will keep you up all night reading. Many a night I kept telling myself one more chapter, and then before you know it it's 3:00 in the morning.<br />If you enjoy Vampire's, and Werewolfs, and never ending love, this is a must read!!!
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|This live collaboration has energy that surprises, given the sort of tepid AOR product that each of these legends has tended to rely on in the art of their late middle age, Clapton especially.  His live album from the \\"Reptile\\" tour could have used the sort of spark that Winwood brings to these proceedings.  Some things never change about Clapton, and one is his need for a foil to bring out his best, particularly in a live setting; only a peer of Winwood's stature could provide that, as he does here.  One look at the set list, full of blues offerings, could have indicated a snooze-fest, given the languidness of Clapton's guitar work in recent years, yet each song is invested with geunine energy, adding R&B-shuffle-fuel to what might have been extended slow-blues yawns.  (The one slow blues here, Winwood's take on Ray Charles' \\"Georgia,\\" is searingly soulful.)  Slowly but surely, Clapton is building a late-career retrospective through his recent live outings, and one hopes he continues to build momentum as he does with this release.  (It may be late in the game to hope for a release of his Dominos-heavy last tour, with Derek Trucks and Doyle Bramhall providing sparks, but one can dream.)  This is to say nothing of Winwood's creative renaissance, which he began with the Latin-flavored (even Santana-ish) \\"About Time\\" album.  All told, a timely collaboration, giving these artists a push they seem to relish and fans the hoped-for result.
B0024F08RO|3.0|Prison Break season 1 was superb, probably the best ever TV series out there. Season 2 still rocks and Season 3 was getting a bit boring. The original concept of this series is to show how a group of ppl managed to get out of prison cell, expertly! But for season 4, i felt that this series has really lost its way, from prison all the way to Sylla? It is now way totally out from the original story in my opinion, so i guess it's really a good time to take this show off air in season 4. I continue to watch this show in season 4 because i have already watched season 1-3 and i really need to know how it ends, otherwise, i wouldn't bother watching this anymore.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|I'd read the reviews on how great this is but still took a big punt on it. Man, this is an amazing movie. I actually found myself slapping my knee at one stage because I was laughing so much.
B00127RAJY|3.0|The work outs are great. Too bad she talks FOREVER before you get to it. You only need to hear that the first time you go through the DVD, not every single time. There should be a track for people to skip through the talk (because the DVD won't let you skip the track). Love the work out, but I hardly ever do it because I don't want to listen to a 10 minute intro every time. Bummer.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I literally just got done my first session with this DVD. Literally must have thought (since, I still don't think I can talk, I'm so out of breath), about 100 times that I hate her. It is hard. Very hard. I'm a beginner, have no arm strength, can't do a push up to save my life, and love this video. In less time than it takes to watch an episode of Spongebob, I can get my workout for the day. No more excuses about not having enough time. This will work.
B001DJ7PR8|1.0|I selected Penelope Cruz when I was completing a form in \\"OscarMania\\" because \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" was nominated in her native land, because she's one of the my movie favourite artistes, because she's loved with our advertisers, because she likes... to look in telescope.     It's false when I'll say I like to watch \\"tv soap opera\\". To seat and look into the box day after day isn't my nature. Concerning movie. The one turned out like a part of some \\"tv soap opera\\". But I am not falling into a faint because, at the same time, this movie showed how it isn't advisable to travel for the sake of it.     General impression of movie must hasn't been main thing for each single artist. Main thing for artist is whether a role is performed, whether a role is subperformed or a role is overdone. Using correctly this approach a role itself will search such artist. There is nothing for it but to select.
B00164KYV4|5.0|This movie is an excellent depiction on how relationships truly are.  The truth is sometimes, brutal, but it's the truth.  Great movie, great cast. If you loved the book you will love the movie!!
B000005ALP|5.0|First purchase of an EEls CD. Excellent. Lyrics & melodies are great. Would love to see in concert
B001TH16DS|5.0|The last time I viewed The Original Series (TOS) was back in 1996-98 when they didn't even have DVD's. So for me to go from VHS to this was extremely significant. I bought this series right away, because I was always a fan of just mainly the original crew (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc.). After seeing the new movie, it renewed my interest, (excellent marketing Paramount!) The HD picture is so much better on this set and the new special effects shots are stunning. I am in shock and awe that this series came out in the 1960's. You will be also when you see the new effects. I also noticed that some of the action is remastered in HD audio. For example, when Kirk throws a punch, you hear it well. The only issue I was curious about was whether they would decide to remaster \\"The Cage\\"(the original pilot) or just leave \\"The Menagerie Pt. 1&2\\" as enough of the episode. This show is really great and a must see for anyone.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Just when I was beginning to lose faith and interest in American TV Chuck Lorre comes along with this gem of a show. Never having watched Roseanne I was unfamiliar with his work and some of the people involved with this show. For me, the stand out actors are Jim Parsons and Kunal Nayyar, Both have amazing comedic timing. It's been a while since I liked a show this much and looked forward to the next episode.   If you haven't seen this give it a try - it really is the best TV show ever.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I have to wait on this one. There is no firmware upgrade for a Magnavox Blu-ray player availible yet. Unless someone out there knows of one. I have the movie I just can't watch it.
B0013D8JAQ|5.0|Love this album.........if I was stranded on a deserted island and could only chose one album, this would be it.....
B001FB55HG|4.0|I was drawn in immediately, and that's not easy for a dedicated sci-fi fan who's seen it all. The opening action sequence alone is astonishing, even for a world overdosed on fx. And the ending is an example of the best in classical theater.     [...] I'd much rather be surprised, slapped with the unexpected. That's where creativity lies, where a good story leads you to a new place you've never been.  Sure there were some cloddy moments, but overall the story and atmosphere made for a rich world. One stark moment had Marcus Wright in the distance walking down a sand dune, with power lines in the foreground - a long pause, a silence; it hearkens back to the best of \\"Twilight Zone\\" and \\"Outer Limits\\", making us look at our own world in a different way.     If there's one thing I judge a sci-fi (or any genre) film by, it's whether it makes me think about our existence and our future; this film, like the first two Terminators, rings that bell.     As for criticism of Christian Bale's performance, I can understand that to an extent; but remember, he wasn't given much to work with, so let's not get carried away with the analyzing. He carried the ball fine - and in the end it really is an ensemble piece involving not just the other actors but all the tech team as well.     True, the film is heavier, darker, more existential than its predecessors. There's also good mind-bending surrealism, characters getting shuffled like a kaleidoscope. Some people like their sci-fi lite, others go for the full deal. There is no question that - despite what critics may say - this film has set a new standard. Like \\"Final Fantasy: Spirits Within\\", which was trashed by critics and then became a benchmark, I expect \\"Salvation\\" to rise in the coming years to a position of general respect.
B00127RAJY|5.0|What I love about this DVD is that it really works. I lost 15 pounds in the first 5 weeks, using it 3 days a week, and following her diet plan. (All you need is hand weights!)<br /><br />When I began using the DVD I was out of shape. I had had a baby a year before, and finally felt ready to start working out again. I also checked her book out from the library to try the diet plan, since she recommends using the DVD and book together. I did not use a diet pill.<br /><br />I starting using the DVD every other day, and did my best to follow the diet plan in the book (it is customized to your body type). The entire six weeks that I used the DVD, I did not progress past level 1. It was hard, but not too hard to do. Jumping jacks, push-ups, ab-crunches and squats make up the majority of the work-out. It goes bam-bam-bam, from one excersize to another, with no rest.<br /><br />The diet itself was strange - for me I'm supposed to eat meals with 50% protein, 50% carbs, in addition to calorie counting. It helped keep me full longer (which is the hardest part of dieting for me - being hungry all the time), but I often ate strange combinations - like a small bowl of cereal and five shrimp, or a yogurt and can of tuna. The book was worth reading, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.<br /><br />I started going to the gym and dropped off using the DVD for the past few months. I've been working with a trainer, and going to the gym four days a week. My kids were sick this week, and since I couldn't make it to the gym, I went back to the DVD. I assumed that since I'm in such better shape that the DVD would be easy - but level 1 was still hard! I was sweating and really felt like I got a great workout. However, at this point I know I'm ready to try level 2.<br /><br />Seriously - get this DVD! I highly recommend the workout - it gave me great results, and it works.
B001KVZ6FM|4.0|Like all Pixar stories, this movie is really two movies, one that has a real heart with solid character development, combined with a rousing adventure tale for the kids.<br /><br />The rousing adventure part of the tale -  an old man lifting his house off on balloons and flying to South America, and then saving this rare giant bird and battling a pack  of talking dogs along the way - was a bit over the top, although young children may enjoy this part of the movie.<br /><br />What made this movie special, for adults, like almost all Pixar movies, was the care shown in fleshing out the two main characters - the old man, Carl, and the over-eager boy scout Russell.<br /><br />Carl  is not just a grumpy old man with a wild dream - in the opening sequence, which is heartbreaking to watch, we see how Carl  first meets his childhood sweetheart, Ellie.  We see them get married, suffer through the inability to have children, and then grow old together in bliss until she dies one day.  We see how from the very beginning as children they shared a fascination for this South American adventurer Charles Muntz, and how they perpetually planned for, but had to put off their plans to visit the fabled Paradise Falls that Muntz had explored.  When she dies and he faces eviction from the house they had always lived together, he sets off determinedly for Paradise Falls.<br /><br />Russell too has his back story -  he misses his father, who used to do simple things with him like sit by the street and count blue cars together, but now his father doesn't have time for him.  It is when Carl asks him why, that the movie strongly hints that Russell's parents are divorced and his dad is now with another woman named Phyllis.  At the end of the movie, Russell's father is still not there for him, despite having promised (only his mother shows up at the boy scout ceremony), but Carl is there for him instead.<br /><br />The movie ends in heartwarming Pixar fashion - through her old scrapbook, Ellie has left a message for Carl to start a new adventure - and he does, and we see Carl take on his new role as surrogate father for Russell, and we also see that his old house has miraculously landed right next to Paradise Falls, just like in the old painting that Ellie had done years ago over their fireplace mantel.<br /><br />The movie has sad and funny moments and is one that the whole family can enjoy together.  It continues Pixar's fine tradition of going beyond mere movie formula to explore the nuances of human relationships and emotion.t a new adventure - and he does, and we see Carl take on his new role as surrogate father for Russell, and we also see that his old house has miraculously landed right next to Paradise Falls, just like in the old painting that Ellie had done years ago over their fireplace mantel.

Well written (though contains tons of medical terms, which could be hard to understand). The book is so inspiring that now I am seeing Alzheimers disease and people diagnosed with this disease in the different perspective. Very informative novel as well.

Getting marked means you have to move to the House of Night and train to become a Vampyre.  Not everyone survives the change...      I've read a lot of mixed reviews about this book, but I liked it.  The storyline was good and kept my attention.  For the most part, the characters seemed like typical teenagers.  Zoey's use of the word \\"poopie\\" was all that seemed a bit off to me.  It was definitely interesting enough for me to continue the series.
159448385X|5.0|Long before Mariam was capable of even understanding the concept, she knew she was a \\"harami\\"- illegitimate and unwanted. Her impoverished, embittered mother, rejected by the wealthy Afghani business man who had fathered Mariam, spirals downward from disgust and hatred through mental illness to an eventual suicide. She spits the cruel, pejorative label into Mariam's face at every opportunity. Her sole remaining purpose in life is to have Mariam join her in the crushing belief that there is no future, no pleasure, no value, no life and no meaning to being a woman in the male-dominated culture of war-torn 20th century Afghanistan.<br /><br />At age 15, Mariam makes an impetuous overture to the father she is convinced loves her in a way her mother simply doesn't understand and sadly discovers that her mother was right all along. Her father summarily pushes her out of his life and away from his legitimate family by arranging her marriage to Rasheed, a 40 year old shoemaker, who treats her exactly as Mariam's mother might have predicted. Physical abuse, beatings, sexual assault, intimidation and virtually complete isolation become the hallmarks of a dutiful Mariam's dreadfully unhappy marriage for the next twenty years.<br /><br />At age 60, Rasheed takes a second wife - Laila, a 14 year old child-woman, separated from Tariq, the young man that she loved and orphaned by the civil war bombs of the bickering Mujahideen warlords. After an impossibly short period of initial infatuation with his new young bride, Rasheed's incorrigible violent misogyny re-surfaces and Laila faces the same daily litany of abuse that Mariam has already known for over twenty years.<br /><br />\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is the gripping, emotionally powerful story of Mariam's and Laila's life together in the wreckage of Kabul, the impoverished Afghanistan city bloodied by years of external war with the Soviets, scarred by civil war among the Mujahideen lords and repressed by the religious intolerance and domination of the Islamic extremists that form the Taliban regime. \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is a novel that nobody will find pretty or comfortable to read.

B000UEYT8A|2.0|I bought this book years ago.  Since that time this volume has appeared in both a white cover and as a two volume set.  My sole encompassing criticism is that most of the songs are in the wrong key.  This is something I did not realize way back when at a time when I barely practiced guitar and assumed that the slightly off -- and often times way off -- key was a result of my poor playing or an out of tune guitar.  Years and countless practice hours later I realize that the sheet music bound in the book was wrong.<br /><br />In most cases the chords are only vaguely similar to the Beatles recordings or performances.  This is not just the case of barre chords versus traditional chords.  In viewing Beatles performances, including many close-ups during Beatles movies, some of the chords in the book are no where close to what is actually being played.<br /><br />As a beginner book this volume is worth adding to your bookshelf.  If you want to do some serious Beatles playing then you should best find another resource.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Ok, it starts out with cranky,old Clint Eastwood's character. The begining is basically the part where it shows why he is all grumpy and has that hoarse smoker's voice. It is somewhat about the car because how the confilct against the Hmong gang all started was because of the car. One of the Hmong boys got got and was forced to work for Clint Eastwood's character. They began to bond with eachother and they began to like eachother. The boys sister was beaten and raped and then Eastwood's character decided to go out and finish his deed. If you are into those dramatic/sad stories and movies, or just any type of genre I would most definitley reccomend this to everybody out there!

He does have the vocal style of a soul shouter in the tradition of guys like James Brown, Solomon Burke, Otis Redding...  However, the musical style is pretty far removed from most of the phases in James Brown's career.  The music itself combines some gritty blues-based guitar with some Stax-sounding horns and a rock feel.  That combination gives this album much more individuality than I was expecting, and it was a happy surprise.  If you are a purist looking for another soul revivalist like Sharon Jones, this ain't it.  However, this album fits very comfortably alongside recent gems by Bettye LaVette (in particular, Scene of the Crime, and I've Got My Own Hell To Raise) and Mavis Staples (in particular, Live at the Hideout), two more established figures in authentic R&B with a penchant for looking forward rather than backward.     Another point of comparison that comes to mind would be the current sound of J.J. Grey & Mofro (at least, the sound on Country Ghetto and Orange Blossoms).  Of course, Grey goes for a more swampy sound, so his albums are a bit more loping and stripped down.  Perhaps if he grew up in Memphis rather than Northern Florida, he would sound more like this.  Put another way, add in some Tony Joe White swamp blues, and Joe Lewis would sound like J.J. Grey.    Anyway, the title of this review pretty much says what you need to know.  If you are looking for some gritty, funky, bluesy, rock-influenced R&B, you can't go wrong with this one.    [...]

Only thing I would change is the size - it is very large and hard to handle when you have a 9 month old in your lap - the illustrations were adorable (one child even looked like my grand child).....Have fun reading it to your \\"little ones\\"....Grandma Rozzi
B000G8NXYQ|4.0|Fellini's 1973 AMARCORD was hailed by critics in both Europe and the United States as a return to the standard of quality of his earlier works. It certainly was more controlled than several of the films that immediately preceded it (like FELLINI'S ROMA and FELLINI SATYRICON), and it's one of his most visually striking films, with celebrated images like the famous peacock flying in a snowfall or the torn turning out to greet the great ocean liner Rex passing by the harbor (shown to be as impossibly large--and as artificial--as the townspeople had hoped). But the film lacks much of a sense of human suffering which always provides the emotional resonance of his best films, and those few moments when it does--such as the town beauty Gradisca pouring out her hopes for a conventional marriage to the townspeople while waiting for the ocean liner's passage--are the best of the entire film.     The film centers upon an entire seaside resort town on the Adriatic in the mid 1930s, during the height of fascism, and it truly stars the entire town, and centers in a cyclic, seasonal way on the few times they all come together: for fascist holidays, a funeral, a ritual bonfire, the greeting of the ocean liner. Gradisca (the voluptuous Turkish actress Magali Noël) makes the biggest impression on the audience; golden-haired Titta (Bruno Zanin) is meant to be the key figure and stand-in for Fellini himself... though, perhaps ungallantly, he is the only physically attractive male character in the entire film (most of his friends seem practically deformed). Indeed, since this is late Fellini there are more physical deformities among his characters than seem fully plausible; but this is all a memory play--showing us Rimini not as it actually was but as the artist remembers it. (This seems to account for the excess of bathroom and bedroom jokes, which are amusing but sometimes repetitive.) You do wish for more sometimes if you've seen Fellini's thematically similar, but far more richly scripted, I VITELLONI; but this is one of the later Fellini's best and most pleasing films.
B001993Y2C|5.0|Friends, I was one of the hesitant ones when the Mini-series premiered with it's \\"re-imagined\\" universe.  Starbuck and Boomer having sex-changes was my big sticking point.  But it worked.  Once in a rare while someone comes along with a vision and the mettle to see it through to what they see as it's conclusion, and you just have to stay out of their way.  Ronald Moore and David Eick are two of those someones.  They created a sensation.  And what really has me on pins and needles waiting for the release of the entire series on Blu-ray, is that they produced the whole thing in HI-DEF, from the first scene.  A previous reviewer stated that anything over [...]for the entire series was over-priced.  With the DVDs, yes this would be true.  But a price of [...] for HD Blu-Ray?  MORE than acceptable.  This will be stunning.  I cant wait.                                                                            ****************************************              Friends,         The wait is over, UPS delivered my boxed set a few hours ago.  The first thing I looked for was, \\"Caprica\\" which was supposed to be included.  Well, apparently they decided at some  point to NOT include it.  There is NO excuse for this GLARING FRACKING omission.       The individual season boxes are just as reviewed by someone else.  You cant take a disc out without getting a finger-print on the edge of the data surface, which means an immediate  wipe with a disc-safe cloth.  I'd have been happy with this type of packaging if they'd lined the sleeves with velvet, or at least felt.       As to the BIG box... it's... attractive I suppose.  I'll have to put the geekoid in me to bed for awhile at some point and clean up a place on my video-shelves to store this thing.  Yeah,  RIGHT!!!  As to the CYLON CENTURION FIGURE that comes looking like it's in hibernation on the top of the box... best to just leave it.  I had to man-handle it out, and I was NOT impressed.  This  thing would sell for about [...]at a dime-store, and that would be pushing it.  The plastic seems to be a bit... rubbery.  The figures long slender fingers FLEX a LOT, which is good because that will keep them from breaking too quickly.  Keep your kids away from this thing.       I'm now beginning to watch the first season, after having just finished the original mini-series.  I thought I'd check on the status of, \\"Caprica\\" and you already know about that.  I'm sure that what we do have here, will be what we wanted from it.  But it looks like, \\"Caprica\\" will constitute ANOTHER expenditure.                                                                            *****************************************              Friends, and now here I am, 9 days later.  \\"The Face of the Enemy\\" webisodes which give a reason for a MAJOR CHARACTERS about-face in attitude and loyalty in episodes 11-14 have  been left off.  WHY?!?!?!  How can Universal POSSIBLY call this the \\"COMPLETE\\" series, when it is NOT complete?  If I'd have known that the webisodes would not be in this set.  I would NOT HAVE  ordered it.  I wish I could delete all of those stars above.  This release does not deserve it.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I took the wife and kids to watch this movie thinking that it will be more of a futuristic action movie with lots of intellectual dialogs.  But, to my surprise I was wrong, this movie has deeply touched areas of my life that I have just try to ignore.  One of them is my identity, where I'm from and who I am.  Another aspect is my mother, who I love, but I try to not show enough affection.  Going back to the movie itself, it has more than what you would expect in every aspect. Acting was great, sound was incredible, the graphics looked very real and a great story that will touch your heart.  A must see!
B001KVZ6FM|2.0|Remember when kids movies used to be for kids? Let's see in the first few minutes we had 1) a death and subsequent funeral 2) an old man's unwillingness to sell his home to a big corporation and 3) the sending of the old man to a retirement home, by the big corporation, as he's become a menace to society. My kids are looking at me like what's this \\"cartoon\\" about.<br /><br />Once you get past all this, the movie does get better and is entertaining. The little boy and the dog are great but all in all, I don't think this one lives up to all the hype.
0920668364|5.0|This book is a must have for all parents.  It is very heart felt.
0375842209|5.0|It's been a month since I read 'The Book Thief' and still find myself thinking about the characters...like long lost friends who have a special place in my heart.  The subject matter is dark but Zusak's use of death as the narrator was so clever it cushioned the tough subject matter.  I've never had such an attachment to book characters.  It is beautifully written and I absolutely loved it. I don't know why it is geared to young adults because I think it is very fitting for adults as well.  My entire book club loved it and raved about it.
0894803123|2.0|I purchased this book along with an ice cream maker for a young adult.  While the book is attractive and nicely illustrated to appeal to a young audience, I was disappointed to see that many of the ice cream recipes incorporate raw eggs.  This is an outdated practice - raw eggs haven't been used in recipes for at least 20 years because of the risk of salmonella .  The ice cream recipes using raw eggs in this book need to be updated or at least include a warning of risk of salmonella contamination inserted.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The vampire issue  is a simple excuse for a deep analysis on human nature. Issues such as bigotry, human's natural attraction with the forbidden, politics, human rights, conservatism, racism, media, cruelty, hypocrisy in religion, indifference... The show is so rich in so many layers. I wonder if the extreme presence of sex is not meant to be an extra provocation after all these years of sissy, conservative, repression of sex that started with reagan, up to the bush years.
1400079179|3.0|Great Book - less than average in condition.  Would probably not buy from this seller again.
B000NJVWU0|4.0|Many things in this world confuse me. The one I'd like to focus on here is that most stores don't carry this album. I can go to Best Buy and pick up every Nelly or Eiminem CD ever made, buy obscure underground albums like My Bloody Valentine (the 80's scottish group) and the complete Sonic Youth back catalouge, or even find the occasional Anthrax disk. But I couldn't find most of the APP albums anywhere!  Remastered Judas Priest? no problem. Remastered ELO? Tricky, but still available. Remastered Alan Parsons Project?   \\"Who?\\"      Now on to the review.      The Project's EVE was one of the strangest albums in their already strange series. EVE features female lead vocals on 2 songs and a series of impressive project signature songs and instrumentals that are completely different in structure from ones on their previous albums. Upon first listening it appears to feature a continuing theme of powerful women tearing down men and their retalliation. But that's only one way of hearing it, as it presents the theme and leaves the listener to interpret it their own way.        This album has all the Woolfson musical trademarks that make his music so catchy, and the orchestration seemlessly blends in and takes the lead just at the right times. Lyrics are deep (as always) but not insanely so (ala Pink Floyd).        Listening to the Project and the few other 70's and 80's groups that made great big music like this makes one wonder why there was so little of it and why everyone else made simple three beat pop hits that drone on and on through every so-called \\"classic Rock\\" station in america.        Bonus features on the remaster are few but some are very interesting. The first track is Elsie's Theme, from the Silican Defense.  For those who aren't fanatics, The Silican Defense was a concept album which was recorded at the same time as EVE. The record company rejected it and it was shelved. This is the first time that anyone outside the Project has heard any of The Silican Defense and that was a treat in itself.        The rest of the bonus tracks are alternates to the original recordings in one form or another, and although interesting, are not as special as the \\"Naked\\" bonuses on other Project remasters.        All in all, if you've never really been a fan of APP but enjoyed one or two of ther songs in the past, or if you're simply looking for something different than the junk you hear on the radio every day, then give The Alan Parsons Project back catalouge a try. You may not like all their music but APP is so diverse that it's a sure bet that you'll find at least a dozen tracks you'll love.       Also, for those who don't know, The Alan Parsons Project is a group name. It featured a rotating line up of great musicians and vocalists. The bulk of the music was written (and occasionally sung by) Eric Woolfson who was also the manager. Alan Parsons was the engineer, occasional co-writer, and played keyboards from time to time. Alan also did some back-up vocals, but rarely ever sang or played. Being that Alan put the albums together and engineered the recording it's best to say that they are an Alan Parsons Project!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Skeptical before watching it, I none the less found this to be a very watchable film - one of Bill Murray's best. I've spent time isolated in a huge oriental metropolis, wide awake and flipping channels at 4AM, walking unfamiliar streets soaking up the ambience, so its easy to relate to the ambience Sophia Coppola and her cinematographer have captured. Excellent cinematography, great writing, teriffic performances; what's not to like? Those reviewers who find it 'boring' must not have spent much time outside their home town, or much time living life. Sofia Coppola has produced a very satisfying film.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|I got this for my niece, who is 10.  She loves it and has found it very inspiring.  The best part about it is that she is not really excited about her singing and dancing lessons.  It has given her a sense of hope and purpose that goes way beyond basic television entertainment.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|I love the Sookie Stackhouse books.  Perhaps that is why I was so disappointed in the television series.  Not having HBO, I had to wait for the DVD to come out to watch the video.  To sum up - Bill is the only half-way decent thing about this series.  It is a pornographic view of everything that is wrong about living in the South.  I haven't been this disappointed in an adaptation of a book since Peter Jackson's high-handed re-writing of J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings.  If you want to watch a lot of sleazy sex, this series is for you.  If you want to watch a story about a young woman with a special talent making the best of her life, and of the people in that life, you will be extremely disappointed.  I will remain a fan of the book series, but I sure as heck won't waste my money on Season Two.
1594481717|5.0|I am reading this book now and really like it. I believe the key component in what Daniel teaches is to have a niche. You can do quite well by serving a niche group of people and put into action his teaching. Having a niche is where its at.
0385486804|5.0|I recently reread \\"Into the Wild,\\" and it's as good the second time as it was the first.  Author Jon Krakauer deserves accolades for doing two difficult things. First, he did exhaustive research on an elusive person by literally tracing his path across the U.S. over a period of months. Second, he thoughtfully put together the elements of psychology, family history, natural history, and literature into this unforgettable book. It's one thing to do research; it's another thing entirely to present it efficiently and with deep emotion.    Ultimately, I don't think I would have liked Alex McCandless, the subject of the book. Though I have an independent streak, I'm not a dreamer, and I don't have a lot of patience for dreamers. I'd probably have been impressed with his skills and his energy, but I'd want to convince him to direct his energy towards something productive. But those reasons don't diminish the power of his story for me.     The story of \\"Into the Wild\\" is well-known by now. Chris \\"Alex\\" McCandless was a smart, athletic, and musically talented son of a NASA engineer. He chafed against authority and structure throughout his childhood, but he graduated from Emory University and seemed on his way to a career as some type of environmentalist or environmental lawyer. Instead, he dropped out of society, never to communicate again with his parents or sister. He embarked on two years of wandering around the U.S. West and Northern Plains. Mostly, he hitchhiked or rode the rails. He camped out in the desert, paddled a second-hand canoe into Mexico, slept under overpasses, and scrounged meals at missions. He worked at hard minimum-wage jobs. He was basically a tramp.     Eventually, he got it into his head to live in the Alaskan wilderness for a few months. His plan was to get as far from modern society as possible.  This would be his greatest challenge, and one that he hoped would bring him spiritual strength and show him the \\"truth\\" he'd read in Tolstoy, Thoreau, Pasternak, and others.  He got to the wilderness and did reasonably well for three months. Then, when he tried to leave, he realized he was trapped -- or, rather, he thought he was trapped. He didn't think very clearly about how to get back to civilization (which was less than 20 miles away), nor, apparently, did he explore any alternate means than hiking out on the exact route he took to come in.  He starved to death.     Author Jon Krakauer meticulously tracked down people who met Chris (who renamed himself \\"Alex\\" McCandless) during his sojouns. Since those people live well outside the mainstream, Krakauer's investigation brings to light fascinating asides about the underbelly of our urbanized country. And he uncovers some possible motivations for Alex's restless pursuit of his own form of a nomadic, monastic existence.     Yet, Krakauer does not romanticize Alex. As a world-class climber and hiker, Krakauer understands both the things that motivate people to challenge the elements and the skills that are necessary to come back alive. He has empathy with Alex's motives (which are not unlike Krakauer's), but he lays out in stark detail why Alex's lack of knowledge led to his horrific death.     In this way, the book serves as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.  Alex inspires because he pursues a dream, because he seeks truth, because he feels pain and joy to the maximum, and because he is not afraid to be afraid. Few of us will ever step off the well-trod path in any aspect of our lives, but Alex did it to the ultimate degree. Yet, the book is obviously also about mistakes, and what it means to be so full of our vision that we don't see the real world that is around us, too.    A couple of other thoughts. First, Krakauer deserves huge credit for revisiting his original story about Chris McCandless and explaining what he got wrong in that piece, and the impact that those errors had on Chris' reputation after death. In an era when many reporters have been shown to lie, it's extraordinary to find a reporter who seeks to declare the truth, even when it puts him in a bad light.  Second, some people have suggested that the book praises Alex too much. On the contrary, I think it downplays his courage and strength. Think about it: Could you  hitchhike for months on end, scrounge food and live off the land, and then muck-out grain silos for a little cash, while charming every person you meet?  All in a search for truth?

It was both well written and well paced.  I actually put it aside to prolong the enjoyment and plan on reading it for a second time very soon.  A very interesting perspective on running done incredible justice by a writer who blended humor with compassion and ultimate respect.  I ordered my running shoes and have been back at it after a very long hiatus.  So nice to not hear only about the challenges of running, the mechanics and injuries, there was certainly information on new theories and practices... but instead to hear about the joy of running. helped me remember what I have loved about running.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest, best, most phantastic show ever created.  I can hardley wait for Season 5 to air.   Can't wait to see what happens next.  Season 4 was a hard one; it kept you on the edge of your seat every episode.  I was getting kind of mad when Sam and Dean started drifting apart there.  The bond these two guys show while on their everyday mission, is one of the things that makes this show so great.  So when in Season 4 they started drifting apart, with Dean displaying his usual follow in his father's demon hunting steps routine and Sam slowly starting to act like a demon/not demon self, I was beginning to wonder where the show was going.  But thankfully, in this season's last episode with the rise of Lucifer, it looks like Sam and Dean are going to start acting like the brother's we fan's love and stick together to fight off whatever Lucifer may bring.  Anyone who hasn't seen this show, needs to hurry up and buy the previous seasons and sit down and watch, because I know that once they do, they won't be able to stop watching and in fact, will probably do what I do, re-watch over and over again until Season 5 airs.  Can't wait for the next season.  I'm so excited!!!  Keep up the great acting Jared and Jensen!

I think he's got an interesting voice that could be an asset with the right material.    This material, however, just makes you want to say \\"get over yourself!\\".  Every (and I do mean *every*) song is so much navel gazing.    I imagine this stuff goes over well with the teenage Goth crowd.  But for everyone else, listen for the voice, ignore the lyrics, and hope for better material in a future release.

0307265730|5.0|Every time I read Jhumpa Lahiri's stories about the children of immigrants, I end up crying because I feel as if she is writing about me personally. I am not Indian, but I believe that she perfectly, exactly captures the push and pull that the children of immigrants (especially immigrants from non-Western countries) feel between America and their parents' home culture.     The first section of the book is stronger than the second, which maybe could be called a novella rather than a short story. I can understand why people criticize her for always writing the same story about the same characters, but for me, I can never get enough. I think that if you had this kind of childhood, especially if it was set in a place where you were extremely unusual for having immigrant parents, the constant reassurance that despite your belief that you were the only one in this situation while navigating the path into adulthood is extremely moving and comforting.     The characters and situations are so real. Usually I finish a short story feeling like there is more to be said, and as a result, I rarely read them, but Jhumpa Lahiri is really the master.

0380820846|5.0|After reading this book for the third time I realized I've never written a review for it here on Amazon.  That situation is being rectified right now.  Even after the third reading I know without doubt that I will read this book again in the future because it is that good for me.  There have been so many reviews written concerning the plot that I'm not even going to get into that area.  Just know that this is the fourth book in the Bridgerton series and the main characters are Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton.  I'm a little hit-or-miss on the full Bridgerton series.  Books #1,2, and 4 I absolutely love.  Book #3 was not as good for me.  After book #4 I think there are lots of differing opinions as to quality of the individual stories.  They can actually be read as stand alone novels because Julia Quinn puts in enough information to bring the reader up to speed on what happened previously.  Since there are already so many reviews it may seem completely redundant for me to write one also, but I hope I can give you an idea of why I recommend this book so highly.  Here are the reasons I love this book so much.<br /><br />1.  The book is a wonderful example of the humor that Julia Quinn does so well in her books.  There are lines in the story which always make me laugh out loud, even though I now know they are coming.  The humor is never sly or mean spirited but reflects how good friends relate to each other.<br /><br />2.  Penelope and her best friend, Eloise Bridgerton, are written to be women you expect to look up and see walk into a room.  They are real, warm, engaging, sometimes exasperating, and loving.  They are two women who are tied together by many circumstances in their lives, but first and foremost because they sincerely like each other.<br /><br />3.  Penelope is not a perfect, ravishing woman.  She is a little plump (even after losing her \\"baby\\" fat over 10 years previously), she is not beautiful, at 28 she has never been married and is officially considered to be a spinster, and she is very shy in social settings.  According to the socially elite of London she completely disappears into the background.  She is even relegated to the background by her mother and two of her sisters.<br /><br />4.  This author has given her leading female character an intellect and allowed her to use it.  How refreshing to read about a woman who is interested in all types of reading.  Penelope is also fiercely independent although that doesn't become apparent to the reader until at least halfway through the book.  And the secret Penelope is hiding is something which is logical, it makes sense, it doesn't grate on my nerves because it is so far fetched as to be completely unbelievable.  Wow, how enjoyable that is for me.  I get so tired of feisty heroines who do completely stupid or impossible things!<br /><br />5.  Colin Bridgerton is a wonderfuly written character.  He seems to have everything at his fingertips; good looks, health, incredible charm, money, social standing.  And yet Ms Quinn gave him a vulnerability which could, and did, cause problems between him and Penelope.

And the secret Penelope is hiding is something which is logical, it makes sense, it doesn't grate on my nerves because it is so far fetched as to be completely unbelievable.  Wow, how enjoyable that is for me.  I get so tired of feisty heroines who do completely stupid or impossible things!<br /><br />5.  Colin Bridgerton is a wonderfuly written character.

The book is must for all those thinkers that debated about the human behavior and how to predict our behavior.  I gave it 5-stars although I did not understand many parts of the book. But not-understanding means to me to read it again.
B00164KYV4|4.0|So i liked this movie because I didn't have too high of expectations. Most movies inspired by books don't do the books justice, but this one did better than most. There is a great cast of characters and plenty of laughs. The only real complaint I have is that certain parts of the movie seemed to drag out, but it is still a fun movie to watch with the girls.
B000009ED0|2.0|I actually liked this when it first came out. 12 years later, I have to wonder why. Kid Rock may be talented from what I've heard about his live shows. I was surprised to find out he could play an instrument. That leads me to believe he might be able to read music...another big surprise. I think there's many much more talented artists out there for sure. This is my personal opinion and I'm entitled to it. He's great if you're not that much into music and have a cheap stereo or an IPOD.
0385341008|5.0|I was skeptical of this book, because the title sounded rather whimsical and cutesy, but the story is anything but! Very affecting, and a good companion to Barbara Pym--the same clear-eyed, brisk look at hardships that we can barely imagine.
0061020710|5.0|Terry Pratchett is a phenomenal writer! I'll tell you that any of his books, especially the Disc World series are well worth picking up! In my youth I loved the Lord of the Rings books by J.R.R. Tolkien (and yes, I'm talking pre-movie adolescence, thank you). I read any fantasy/adventure novels I could get my hands on. Eventually I ran out of books worth reading.... In my late teens I even resorted to Harry Potter, which I thought was amusing (but with a very low reading level) until I stumbled upon Terry Pratchett. Oh what a day! It was as if I had been waiting for his writing since the first time I picked up a book! The worlds he has created within the Disc world series are so interesting and entertaining. On each page he has spelled out endless wit, comedy, and enchantment. The characters hook you from the start and in each book you learn more about them and how they intertwine with one another. The imagery Pratchett depicts with his stories is absolutely amazing! And one of the things that I think is the best about this series is you don't necessarily have to read them in a particular order. There are a few here or there within the series that do fit better together read in a certain order but besides those you can just go with the next one that strikes your fancy. Every time I finish one I CANNOT wait for the next! Soon I'll be done with the series and this is sad... But reading them all was well worth it! See for yourself!
4789009637|4.0|In my study of Japanese, I've used Genki (the standard textbook at my College) as my primary text.  I definitely recommend the text but when it comes to learning any foreign language, no textbook on it's own will take you to mastery.  Here are a few additional resources that I found particularly helpful in supplementing Genki, in the areas of listening, speaking, Kanji and slang.    - Genki Online \\"Self-Study Room\\":  Lots of resources here, my favorite of which is \\"Genki Movies.\\" The textbook dialogues are presented by native speakers in a more natural way (meaning more challenging to comprehend) than the CDs that accompany the text.    - [[ASIN:0974869449 White Rabbit Press Kanji Flashcards]]: Genki is a little light on Kanji in my opinion.  These are truly the best Kanji flashcards available.  I started by re-arranging the cards to correspond to each Genki chapter, then expanded my study to incorporate additional Kanji not covered in Genki.  They've got way more info on each Kanji character than the text does, and they're organized for JLPT test prep if you're into that.    - [[ASIN:0743523539 Pimsleur Japanese I - 3rd Ed.]] and [[ASIN:0743528832 Japanese II - 2nd Ed.]]: These audio courses go much further in terms of building your listening and speaking skills than the text with accompanying CDs alone.  They also introduce new vocabulary that's not included in the text.  So far I've discovered that Japanese I roughly corresponds to the grammar covered in the first half of the Genki I text.  Note there's also a [[ASIN:1599120135 digital version of levels I, II and III]] available.    Lastly, for those who want to learn Japanese the way it's really spoken on the streets of Japan,  - [[ASIN:0804833966 Making Out in Japanese, Revised Edition]]: This little book has all the slang, chit-chat, insults and pick-up lines that have been understandably omitted from the Genki text.  It also delineates which expressions are used by which genders.      Good luck with your Japanese language studies!
B0002DB52M|5.0|No props only tape lines where houses and stores would be on an empty stage.  Dialogue carries this film and even though there are no props, the director has you seeing the town clearer than the real thing. once again another film made that does not need SFX to be great.

0974869449|5.0|The hallmark of any gaijin teaching her or himself Japanese is this: a bookshelf full of books, workbooks and flashcards of disappointingly low usefulness (and often exclusively in Romaji - WTF?!!)  Throughout my own trial-and-error, I'm grateful to have stumbled across one nugget of gold: White Rabbit Kanji Flashcards.    I'm taking University-level Japanese (we use Genki) and was looking for some supplemental Kanji materials (the Genki text is a little Kanji-light, methinks).  I tried several different books and cards without satisfaction (including Tuttle) until I discovered White Rabbit.  Now my Kanji skills are way ahead of everyone else in my class--I know on-yomi and kun-yomi, common compounds, stroke order.       Don't be daunted by what looks like TMI!  As other reviewers have pointed out, these cards are extremely well thought out and organized:    - They follow the JLPT levels (although I can attest that they are great even if you have no intent to ever take the JLPT)  - They use kana for all pronunciation (Sayonara romaji!)  - They incorporate 6 frequently used compounds on each Kanji (this has turned out to be a huge aid for me in memorization as it provides a \\"context\\" for the individual Kanji)  - Plus radical breakdown, stroke order, commonly mistaken Kanji, an excellent index, and they're really durable cards!    I've now moved on to Volume 2 and just cannot recommend these cards highly enough!  Max and Tomoko-san have earned an A+!    BTW, if you carry your flashcards around with you, White Rabbit sells some cool plastic cases that fit around 60 of these cards.

0385340575|3.0|Fair or not, every Lee Child Jack Reacher book has to be compared to the other Jack Reacher books.  This was a reassuring step up from last year's \\"Nothing to Lose\\", but it still just missed.  Like all the Reacher books, it can stand alone, but knowing the main character gives the reader instant familiarity with his eccentricities.    This entry in the series has plenty of action, especially in the last fifty pages, and plenty of Reacher's stellar deductive reasoning.  However, the setting, like that in \\"Nothing to Lose\\" just doesn't ring true (understanding that \\"ringing true\\" in any of these books is a relative term).  The old Jack Reacher used to be thrust into situations where he was forced to fight the bad guys to a) save some one; and b) save himself.  In this book as in last year's, Reacher thrusts himself into a life-threatening situation just because he \\"hates to go backward\\".  It's fine if a character does not want to walk away, but the plot here is so forced it really defies logic, especially for Reacher who likes to portray himself as a person who reacts rather than an agressor.      That having been said, the plot is still a good one.  The foreign female characters are excellent (can't say much more without giving it away).  What appears to be a suicide to start the novel is much much more and just the tip of the iceberg with foreign intrigue, the NYPD, FBI and nameless national agencies all aligned against Reacher at one time or another and even, for a short time, all at once.  Once again, Reacher defies the odds through his unique blend or Holmesian reasoning and physical prowess.    All in all, a fair book, but nothing great.  I hope Reacher is not tiring.

B001MYIXAC|2.0|Given the gushing reviews here and elsewhere, I had high expectations for this movie.  I expected to see a nuanced, innovative, and intelligent take on the vampire myth.  What I got was a movie so slow and disjointed, that it was nearly impossible to watch.    The movie's overriding problem is that nothing happens.  There is a complete absence of suspense; there's nothing at stake.  Suspense doesn't require over-the-top action or a ticking clock of doom.  Just a sense that the characters have a goal or some sort of motivation.    Clearly young Oskar, the protagonist, is an unhappy kid, bullied and isolated.  And yes, he fantasizes about the day when he will finally turn the tables on his bullies.  But the movie's producers, apparently mistaking \\"glacial pacing\\" for \\"subtle,\\" have crafted a movie that creeps so slowly, even the protagonist seems bored.  Perhaps Oskar is supposed to acquire his eventual courage through his friendship with girl-vampire next door, Eli, but their relationship meanders as aimlessly as the rest of the plot.    The vampire, Eli, played by Lina Leandersson is the strongest aspect of the movie.  Simultaneously creepy and sad, she's all vampire without the usual gothic Lolita trappings.  But as with everything else in this movie, much of her life makes no sense.    Why for instance does she need Hakan, her apparent Renfield?  As the movie demonstrates, she's more than capable of getting her own meals.  And Hakan, in addition to being a total incompetent, employs methods of procuring her a meal that are hardly subtle. In a typical town, with normal police, the appearance of dead bodies, drained of blood and stuffed in drainage channels would generate a lot of police interest.     In fact, as the body count slowly rises (slow being the operative word for this movie), people spontaneously combust, and sightings of a strange girl who attacks people are reported, the police are curiously absent.  In this cold little slice of geography, the policeare apparently more interested in doughnuts than solving crime.    Further complicating matters is the movie's editing, which is jarring, often jumping erratically from one scene to another with no sense of conclusion for the previous scene.    The strongest element of the movie is the ending, which avoids the usual (read American) need to dish out justice to the bad guy (in this case the vampire), and which is also enhanced by a strong sense of ambiguity.    But Let the Right One In's complete lack of character motivation and suspense creates a movie, which while starkly beautiful, brooding and atmospheric, is ultimately as lifeless as a vampire.    (Note:  I watched the dubbed version, which I suspect is some of the worst dubbing ever, making the characters, especially the adults, look like blithering idiots.)

He signs a paper donating his organs to science -- Skynet!<br /><br />We're introduced to 2018, a war-torn California where they are fighting only one of many branches of Skynet as it slowly exterminates humans and as we find, experimenting on them to create human-cyborgs that think and act human.  Quite an enemy that can take  on your own face and feelings.<br /><br />Skynet however does not take into consideration the human frailties of love, honor and obedience.<br /><br />What struck me about the film was how the humans were using the same tactics that the machines were, to the point of taking on their ruthlessness, even among their own kind.<br /><br />Several points of interest:  How is there a working command base and air force if the machines are destroying humans?  You would think that would be fairly illogical to not destroy the human's war machines.  Oh well, just a story.<br /><br />And the Dante's Inferno feel of the Skynet fortress, stepping deep into the 7th Circle of Hell with accompanying music -- moody and interesting!<br /><br />Moon Bloodgood -- nice eye candy and a kickass fighter.

My stereo sits to the right of me no more than 2 feet away while I'm at work, and I listened to these recordings closely.

076790592X|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie shows a different perspective while it explains how we must perceive our lives rather than conform to the worldly views of society.   Mitch, who has forgotten his ways and emerged himself in work later finds Morrie, his teacher in college. He then finds out that Morrie is sick and is close to dying. Mitch then finds Morrie and with every Tuesday he constantly visits Morrie and restarts to form a bond of coach and player. I recommend this book because not only does it teach how bonds can be recreated but also that the worldly things in life does not hold much value as the things picked up as time passes by. The book teaches the reader how to accept what life throws at you and teaches how to send out the messages of heart-warming feeling to others. Morrie says \\"love each other or perish\\" as he teaches till the end of his time to fall away from the society's wants and rights and go with your own feeling and accept the true feelings that comes within you. Mitch then learns how to reconnect with himself as he lets go the works and stress that had brought him down in the first place. Tuesdays with Morrie is a great book that teaches life lessons and if your looking for any philosophical or a quick book to read, I recommend the book to anyone looking for something to read.

0198534469|5.0|Having struggled when first taking complex analysis in college, I wanted to find a book that presented the topic in a much more clear and concise manner.  Visual complex analysis not only helped in that endeavour, but increased my understanding of the subject tenfold.  A key aspect of this book is looking at complex variables as transformations.  Using this book, I put together a computer program to transform various objects into other objects.  This was an understanding that I acquired through this book and did not grasp earlier when taking this course as an undergraduate.  I recommend the book strongly as a companion to students taking complex analysis to clarify topics in this subject and save many hours trying to de-mystify the topic.

B000XTLUW0|5.0|This is one of the most amazing live albums I have ever heard. The DVD footage is incredible, well produced, and the music again, is amazing. I was just recently introduced to Muse and I am very thankful for that. I'm not sure why American bands always seems to be churning out the same ol' cookie cutter stuff and I defy anyone to name me one American band that can match Muse on any level. The fact that they are coming to North America this year to open up for U2 in my opinion is a complete insult. Nothing against U2, they have their place, but Muse by no means should be playing a supporting role to anyone.    -David

You'll love it too!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|The number of rarities that needed to come together for this film to work as well as it does is as mind-boggling as the content. As citizens of a country, we always wish we could enter the mind of those in power or those working with those in power, but we know we never can, because we know that all those in power are secretive and hide their true opinions, most of the time for security reasons or to cover their guilt. So that McNamara opened up like this is the first incredible offering of the film. That he revealed not just the facts but his emotions towards them is the second. This is a man that either has not let his guilt blind him or at least is using this film opportunity to transcend his guilt. Combine this with the music and visual hypnotic craftsmanship of Philip Glass and Erol Morris, and this is a must see political film. Perhaps the best of the genre.
B00005K3NR|5.0|In league with 'The Shining', 'Cujo', and so on.  A 70s masterpiece in the horror genre.  It is relentless in scary psychological undertones that play on the emotions, sympathy as much as terror and wonder.  Sissy Spacek is dynomite.  The filming is dynomite as well with touches of the 70s that you make you wonder how you survived this era.  Truly creepy but a very interesting drama as well.  Beauty and terror ride high in this feat by Brian DePalma - and the mind of Stephen King.
B001IBIQU6|1.0|I've been a Depeche Mode fan since my sister and I went halfsies on Speak and Spell in 1981 (on vinyl, no less). I own all of their albums, and generally love all of them, although a new album generally takes 3-4 listens to grow on me and capture me.      Exciter disappoints me the most out of all their albums.  I found it dull, maudlin and thin, and feared then that the group head reached its end.     Playing the Angel gave me new hope that the group could still make the type of Depeche Mode music I came to love - emotive, sometimes harrowing, sometimes angry, with extremely catchy if not nasty, intense riffs. A Pain That I'm Used To, John the Revelator, Suffer Well, and Lilian all convinced me that these guys could still put me on the roller coaster.     Not so with this album.  I've given this one several tries and it just is not happening.  Hole to Feed and Wrong probably come closest to what I like from Depeche Mode, but Wrong is boringly repetitive, and Hole to Feed quickly deemphasizes the initial, deep riff which could have made for a great DM song.  Otherwise the songs are frankly boring, with thin sound, vocals that seem to flounder all over the place, lazy tempos, and no memorable riffs.  The \\"retro\\" sound reminds me of - get this - Duran Duran and Yaz.  I grew out of the Atari sound 20 years ago.  Depeche Mode always seemed to keep itself fresh; SOTU sounds like a stale blend of Exciter tempos and mood on sounds from A Broken Frame.    Sorry guys, really badly wanted to like this one, but it falls way short.  Wife and I will go to the concert this summer, but only to hear the old stuff.  Because this sounds too much like a 401k (retirement) effort, and maybe the last opportunity to see them in concert.

B001KVZ6FM|4.0|My family is just back from seeing \\"Up,\\" and it's an odd movie, but it worked for me.  I'd recommend seeing it without reading much beforehand, but if you want to know more, it's part existential philosophy, part Odd Couple/road trip movie.  It's a little [[ASIN:B000ADS630 Wizard of Oz]] a little [[ASIN:B001SGN1JM Land of the Lost]] and a lot [[ASIN:B0001CNQVM Scooby Doo, Where Are You!]] in my opinion. (I was just waiting for someone to say, \\"And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for the meddling kid, the old man, and the dog!\\")    I saw the movie with 9 and 10-year-olds, and they enjoyed it, but on another level if features \\"circle of life\\" themes that will resonate with adults:  lessons about letting go, and what it means to have a life well-lived.    This very \\"cartoonish\\" animated film was also a three-hanky tearjerker for me, the kind where the adults will cry more than the kids.  Only Pixar could pull off such a crazy adventure tale with heart.
B00008WT5M|3.0|I always loved Brian Johnsons voice because he sounded like a real rock singer with a nice smoky rough voice, but on this album his voice waas too rough. The bamd sounded great.

B001GCUO1Q|3.0|I don't think this strenuous 2009 offshoot of the [[ASIN:B000HEVZ9E X-Men]] series should be dismissed entirely, but it really doesn't contribute much to the genre the way [[ASIN:B001C08RHA Iron Man]] and [[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight]] did last year. Both of those films set a high water mark for comic book franchises, and unfortunately director Gavin Hood ([[ASIN:B000FC2FX8 Tsotsi]]) can't seem to get his filmmaking arms around what would make Wolverine a compelling character over the course of 107 minutes. Don't blame Hugh Jackman, who puts in a valiant effort now in his fourth familiar turn in the title role. Addressing the inner demons of a conflicted character should have been within Hood's oeuvre given his previous serious-minded work, but he seems overwhelmed by the film's persistent blockbuster aspects. Fight scenes seem identical with each other, and there are lots of them here, so much so that the net result is more wearing than enthralling with the choreography and special effects looking the same from scene to scene. There are also new characters constantly introduced, each with some unique superpower of dubious distinction, so the story starts to feel like a springboard for yet more franchises.<br /><br />Given that I am not familiar with the X-Men series, I will trust that screenwriters David Benioff ([[ASIN:B0012OX7EO The Kite Runner]]) and Skip Woods have remained faithful to the comic book with the convoluted storyline, a true chore to follow for the uninitiated like myself. The opening sequence shows Wolverine as a sickly child sometime in the middle of the 19th century. Along with his brother Victor, he has apparently fought every major war since the Civil War, both getting killed and resuscitated for their next enlistment. The immortality aspect is probably the most problematic aspect of the story since it really doesn't give the viewer any legitimate reason to be concerned with Wolverine's ultimate fate. Consequently, the story focuses the conflict more on Wolverine's soldiering for the government and his growing identification as a mutant. This inner turmoil tears the brothers apart since Victor cannot forgive his brother for deserting the military. However, living peacefully as a poor lumberjack in Canada with his comely schoolteacher girlfriend Kayla does not prevent him from being drawn back to the cause as a member of an elite mutant unit due to the persistent efforts of Colonel Stryker.<br /><br />Even if abject alienation is still not his forte, Jackman does what he can with a rage-filled cardboard role that requires him to alternate between vindictive and sympathetic in lightning flashes. In an exasperating turn, Liev Schreiber has even less latitude as Victor (a.k.a. Sabretooth) since we never figure out why he turns so completely malevolent. Danny Huston fares better as Stryker since the character is rich in Machiavellian tendencies that are easy to root against. Lynn Collins plays an ambiguously dichotomous role similar to Eva Green's in the James Bond vehicle, [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale]], and Ryan Reynolds has a near-cameo role as yet another comic book franchise in the making. He provides some much needed comic relief, but it's not enough to offset the constant mayhem. The explosion-driven helicopter chase and the relentless fight atop the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor are the only set pieces that linger in the memory. The rest of the movie will have greater resonance for devoted fans of the comic book.more on Wolverine's soldiering for the government and his growing identification as a mutant.

B001SGEUNI|5.0|I bought this album after hearing Halestorm on the radio, and I could not wish for a better sound.  Liz Hale brings you back to the good old days when women didn't have to sound whiney to draw in a crowd. She's like a hit of Lita Ford and Heart all in one.  Love the instrumentals; the guys have real boost.  Thank God for this band.
B001P9KR94|1.0|After finally getting to view this I will start with the good. Excellent Blu-ray in terms of audio/video quality. Soundtrack is fantastic so fans of this movie will be very happy.<br /><br />The movie itself I did not care for at all, all the hype surrounding the Oscars I really was expecting a lot more. This is just my opinion. If you havent seen it yet I highly suggest a rental first!
B000002UB3|5.0|The Cd was in amazing condition, and not a scratch was found on it anywhere. very good, very good. and honestly, can you really go wrong with the beatles?
B00133KFGW|5.0|So good my mother in law liked it. A delightful fairytale of impossible happenings. Check reality at the door, sit back and enjoy. As with all good fairytales, just as things get set good the final credits role . If you like the genre live with it. If you don't like the genre you will miss a delightful, well crafted story.
0446402397|5.0|This action novel is the most powerful psychological treatment of life under Stalin since Alexander Solshenitzin. If you wish to understand why Russians make great chess players, read this book.  It is not about chess, but about the mental gymnastics required with every statement in a state where any statement can be punished.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series should still be in production! Great story lines, wonderful interaction between actors & characters, some of the funniest one-liners ever acted and the detail put into the scenery, the costumes, AND THE SHIP!!!! AMaZING!
0316066524|5.0|The writing was inspiring and worth every moment it took to read it. I am reading it for the second time and it just gets better.
0812968255|5.0|Generally speaking, I really dislike \\"new translations\\" for the very reasons that those 3-star ratings below cite--they are usually watered down, do not actually convey what the author really meant to convey, and often treat the reader as an idiot without a shot at getting his GED. In fact, if my study of ancient languages were better, I might go with what they suggest. However, this translation does clear up several impenetrable idioms that the usual reader would find frustrating. And the original does stand up against this treatment. It's amazing. Another item I usually skip--the introductory essay aimed at keeping some professor both in print and in a job--was surprisingly useful. A great little edition full of some often very powerful principles. Very pleased with this inexpensive translation full of useful notes. I would buy it again in an instant with my limited budget for books.
1575666286|4.0|This is not the first exposure I've had to the Gerson Therapy--I've also watched both videos on the subject.  This book is well put-together and will walk you through most of the steps necessary to do the Gerson Treatments yourself.   I would recommend it to anyone who is open-minded about treatment protocols that are not necessarily endorsed by the A.M.A.
B001PP9ALY|3.0|it was ok. there are some cool stunts. way too much cursing for my taste. i don't mind when it contributes to the character - but it seemed like they threw in curse words just to be cool.  the plot was ok - but i kinda guessed it from the beginning so it wasn't a surprise or anything.  i don't like the part with the rats - but whatever. i guess it's worth renting once, but i probably wouldn't buy it.

0786860707|5.0|The Illusion of life is a heart felt take on the progression of animation (particularly disney) from the late 20s through more modern traditional animation.  It also covers the principals of animation and includes MANY pictures on each page to clarify points made.  It features many flip book animations in the margins.<br />Good for anyone interested in the entertainment industry (even video game development)<br />If your not interested in the studying the field of animation, it's just plain interesting.
0340881542|4.0|This book is the second in the CHERUB series.  It's action-packed and a page-turner.  I'd say the books in this series are for teens, as some of the content is too mature, in my opinion, for younger readers.  So, if you're a parent and considering the CHERUB series for your kids, you might want to take a look into more detailed plot summaries. (Good summaries are available at wikipedia.)  You may find the Alex Rider, Jimmy Coates, Artemis Fowl, and Percy Jackson series more suited to capable younger readers.
0805079831|5.0|Will US citizens be subjected to \\"shock therapy\\" by the subprime crisis(a form of disaster capitalism) If you read Naomi Klein's book the faint outlines become very clear..very frightening...Watch the public sector go on the auction block to cover state/local/federal gov't budget deficits..So the Wall Street bailout will aid the banks in facilitating purchases of public goods on the cheap!    Klein through a series of case studies document how the IMF/world bank either take advantage of disasters or create them for the benefit of multinational banks/manufactures/mineral extraction/travel industry interests. The Chicago School of Economics theorists private the false economic doctrines & the Dictators/US Military/Homeland Security/ contractors provide the muscle.    >So we see fishermen on prime beach front property from Sri Lanka displaced by the tsunami only to return finding property off limits..Gotta make room for the Hotels/Resorts> The natives are left to fend for themselves in temporary shantytowns which much of the disaster relief subsidized.   >In South Africa Apartheid has been kept in place with increasing poverty rates. How? Former ANC activists contend they focused on reforming the government while not grasping the role of the IMF/World Bank conditionalites which totally undermined economic reforms. So we now see the government/parliment run by the black majority while the same discriminatory white business interests control the economy.  >In Russia, Yeltsin destroyed the parliament and by decree handed out state property to former communist party insiders as the Clinton administration & the Western Press cheered. Why? The property giveaway was the bridge to forming partnerships with western interests to gobble up property for pennies on the dollar.    Several other case studies focusing on New Orleans Poland,Chile,Bolivia,South Korea,Thailand etc
B001DTPZNY|1.0|As a Peruvian, I have felt deeply insulted by Steven Spielberg. I admire him as a great moviemaker, but this film sinks irremediably in the ocean of the Great Mediocrity. If he ever visited my country, at least he should have made the script previosuly reviewed, by somebody who had visited Peru!!!!<br /><br />George Lucas, David Koepp and Jeff Nathanson were also the great collaborators for making this movie, one of the greatests BLUNDERS of Cinema history... Where did they get the foolish ideas for the script and the locations? From those old Carl Banks' 'Disney Ducks' comic collection???... From Belgian cartoonist Herge', the great maker of 'The Adventures of Tintin'???... I cannot imagine how these supposedly \\"greatly reputated\\" film makers (Spielberg & Lucas) got associated on making a disastrous film like this!!!<br /><br />Imagine... A typical town of Peru, Nasca (where the magnificent Lines of Nasca are drawn in the middle of desertic soil), located pretty close to Cusco???  Hey you, there are some hundred miles from one place to the other!!!!  And... Mexican music played in a Peruvian town market???...<br /><br />C'mon messrs. Spielberg and Lucas!!! Don't you ever keep thinking that we Peruvians and Mexicans, are the same thing!!!<br /><br />Spend your valuable money in any other of the great items sold by Amazon, not on purchasing this movie! IT SUCKS!!!!

B001LPWGE6|5.0|As far as Im concerned, Bourne is the best action movie series ever made and it gets even better on bluray.
B000P0J0B0|2.0|Screen lore tells us, and there's reason to believe its true, Quentin Tarantino sold the script for NBK to finance his brilliant Reservoir Dogs.    Makes me wonder what might have happened had Tarantino been able, somehow, to hold this one in reserve and make it himself.    He's more subtle than Oliver Stone, in the same sense that a single drop of rain is more subtle than a tsunami.  He's more inventive, and cannier by far, and he understands these characters better.    Stone took what may have been a fine story, and turned it into an exhausting mess.  I truly did not like it.  I gave it two stars because of Harrelson and Dangerfield and Downey, worth the price of admission when the film was released, maybe worth a Netflix rental, but NOT going in my collection.
B001R0KH3W|4.0|On September 30, 2008 Stevie Wonder took his Wonder Summer Nights Tour to the O2 Arena in London and put on a show that will not soon be forgotten. This DVD captures that night perfectly. Performing with a 14 piece band that featured his daughter Aisha on backing vocals, Wonder worked through his catalogue and got the audience on its feet in a show that never slowed from beginning to end.    The concert was expertly filmed in high definition by Hamish Hamilton and the sound design was equally excellent. Wonder fuses soul and jazz into his music like no other and his ample talents were on display on this night. Highlights included Higher Ground, Visions, Part Time Lover and Sir Duke.    The only issue that I had with this disc is that it featured no extras. This was however one of the best concert DVDs that I have reviewed in a long time. If you have any interest at all in Wonder's music this is essential viewing.
B001UE27X8|2.0|This is a very tired Tony.  There is nothing new or fresh about this CD.

1401207138|5.0|Amazing book made even more amazing. Worth the extra price simply to read Watchmen in a slightly larger format. It may be only slightly larger, but it looks so much better. The new subtly different coloring is loyla enough to make it hard to find a difference, yet looks worlds better. Just brighter, I'd say. All in all, it's worth it for the presentation, but also for the cool info found in the extras. Get it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I saw two episodes of this show when it first aired. I liked it but I lost track of it during the season. So I purchased the first season. I have never read the books so I am not all bent out of shape over the TV adaptation. I find the show interesting and funny. I guess I will have to read the books to find out why so many are fascinated with Sookie Stackhouse. I find Sookie to be annoying and naive. Even though Sookie works my nerves I still love the romance between Sookie and Bill. I have to say that Bill is one of my favorite characters. I also enjoy Lafayette and Tara. I even liked Sookie's grandmother.  I think the character of Jason is a dimwit horny toad that has no purpose as far as I can see. Well I take that back he is very funny at times. I like Sam and hope he finds someone so he can stop pining over Sookie.   I am not a prude and I know this is HBO and they will use nudity and language to get people to watch. I just feel that the show is great without it.  Oh and one last note Sherrif Dearborne and Detective Andy ( I think that's his name) are the most clueless law enforcement officers I have ever seen. They are the only characters that I wish would not return for season 2.
B0013ND36G|3.0|Movie looks great - very crisp/clear on Blu-Ray player and plasma tv.    It felt a little like a tv show/movie rather than a theatrical movie like the first two. Not sure what about it made it feel like that, but it was there.....    Pretty much the same story as T2 - Arnold is zapped back in time, heads to a bar, gets come clothes heads out to protect someone....meanwhile another terminator (more advanced, just like T2) also is zapped to earth, commandeers a vehicle, and starts hunting down people....where have we heard this before?    Overall I did enjoy it, but a little \\"freshening\\" up of the story would have been nice.
055380684X|5.0|Coyle has written an extraordinary book examining the mechanics of skill building within the brain that has revolutionary implications for learning, parenting, teaching, coaching, leadership, and perhaps above all, self-awareness. I can't recommend it highly enough.
B001TODCII|5.0|I'm not huge on the whole movie-review thing. Usually, because I can't come up with anything worth while to say for most of the movies today. But, in this case--with this movie--I have alot to say...    First off,(without spoiling the plot for those who haven't seen it)I want to commend the screenwriters--or novelist--for even thinking up this movie.  It was gutsy and bold--despite the PG-13 rating. Few screenwriters want to even express the truth that this film holds. The subject matter is a bit controversial, and few people would touch the idea w/ a 10 ft pole.    Secondly, I want to commend the talented actor Liam Neeson for portraying the character of Brian Mills so eloquently and with raw emotion. Have I ever seen a movie of yours that I didn't like? I think not. You bring the emotion from the screen direct to us...the viewers.    And finally, to the director and producers: Despite the slight--and I mean slight plot holes--you guys tied this movie together almost seamlessly. Full of action, emotion and adrenaline. This movie left me surprisingly impressed.    In short, I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 13--due to the violence and subject matter.     I think all young people should watch it--and I am a young person, so I can say it is an eye opener for me. It might provide a much needed wake up call to those unaware of the trafficking of American girls into slavery in foreign countries.    Buy this movie! Lol
B001TI9N7I|5.0|Elegantly written, suspenseful, full of twists and turns in a setting unfamiliar to most of us in the US, social, political undercurrents, with an understated style that mirrors Swedish society and yet universal in its appeal. A must read for the best is yet to come in book 2 of 3 ( which I have read after buying it in Europe). You will be hooked, I guarantee!
B00192KCQ0|3.0|What can I say, it is much better than the last few albums. first track is the standout and all nightmare long video is outstanding - what the album lacks is that sonic-boom you got from the early albums (puppets) the drum track still sound tinny and the solos are un-inspired and lazy. Metallica were once great as was sabbath in its time , I don't understand why Hetfield & co. insist they don't want to remake master of puppets yet all the hardcore fans want it! they've forgotten how to thrash!! Releasing day that never comes is a BIG @#$%ing mistake worst song B-side from load (self-forfilling title) at best, fast part towards the end of the song is completly laughable, very spnal tap-esq except...and they continue with Broken,beat & scarred??? I wish somebody would fire Q-prime and get some sensable management (lars' dad -\\"I would delete it!\\") honesty is best! I can't say welcome back boys yet, but I hope they were taking notes when Lamb of God opened for them last year, felt like Ozzy in 86' when Metallica blew oz away every night. lastly NO MORE Documentaries Please!! that mosnter did more damage to this band than Al Queda does to women. I take it back, It was very endering to see James go see his little daughter's dance lesson, but on the other hand, Lars came off even a bigger douche-bag than ever!!
B000EHSVOG|5.0|This film was the first in a trilogy of films that I recently acquired for nostalgia purposes when they were released in the 1970's.<br /><br />The other two were Earthquake and Poseidon Adventure and I always felt that the Towering Inferno was unique in its talent and direction.
B00005MP58|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this movie. If you are not into old-fashioned romances and Jane Austen novels/movies - this won't be for you. But if you enjoyed Sense and Sensiblity, Emma, etc - you'll love this one too. It's long so save time for a movie marathon, but it's worth every penny. The Amazon price is really good too, compared to purchasing it at a specialty movie store. This one, in my humble opinion, is SO MUCH BETTER than the more recent Pride and Prejudice version with Keira Knightley (no offense - the acting is good, but the storyline has way too much cut out to make it shorter for the boxoffice). And my favorite part of the movie - Colin Firth. Can't get enough of staring at him! lol. Great movie - you won't regret it. It's been a true favorite of mine for years and I could watch it time and time again.

052167543X|5.0|I have a large collection of English Grammar books. I have found this one to be the best. Each topic is clearly set out, one page of explanation followed by one page of exercises, indexed for easy referral. Ideal for the student who wants to work by him/herself (with answers in the back) or the teacher who wants to check the accuracy of what he/she is teaching. English is a convoluted language with many exceptions to the rule and it is important to be able to present it accurately and clearly to students the first time.Many of my students have bought this book as they consider it sets out clearly all the things they were unsure about in the past.

The recipes all make a quart of ice cream, which is perfect for my machine.  The book also talks about the science of ice cream and the growth of Ben & Jerry's as a business, both of which are a really interesting read.    I made the Georgia Peach ice cream, and I added some fresh ginger to it.  The result was expressions of delight on my husband's and kids' faces and three enthusiastic thumbs up.    I'm going to make the Chocolate Cinnamon ice cream next!

0345495004|4.0|Interesting slice of FLW's life with M. Cheney.  Reminds me of the saying,  \\"Be careful what you ask for, you may get it...\\"  M. Cheney tested the waters of women's freedom to \\"be,\\" but the cost for her was disastrous.  Read the book Many Masks before you read this book.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I have enjoyed this seris, however, I did not know that every book provides more questions than it answers.  I think the story is great and the characters are well developed but I would like for the story, at some point, to be resolved.  The next book is still not published even though this one has been out since 2005.  If Mr. Martin can not bring a conclusion to some of these characters (without killing them) then I will not continue to buy\read future installments.
B00288KNLS|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the best movies for (older) kids I have seen in a very long time. A welcome break from all the movies with a super nice and/or super intelligent dog that you usually get to see here in the USA.....
1416914307|4.0|o save her mother's life, Clary must travel to the City of Glass, the ancestral home of the Shadowhunters -- never mind that enter-ing the city without permission is against the Law, and breaking the Law could mean death. To make things worse, she learns that Jace does not want her there, and Simon has been thrown in prison by the Shadowhunters, who are deeply suspicious of a vampire who can withstand sunlight.<br />As Clary uncovers more about her family's past, she finds an ally in mysterious Shadow-hunter Sebastian. With Valentine mustering the full force of his power to destroy all Shadow-hunters forever, their only chance to defeat him is to fight alongside their eternal enemies. But can Downworlders and Shadowhunters put aside their hatred to work together? While Jace realizes exactly how much he's willing to risk for Clary, can she harness her newfound powers to help save the Glass City -- whatever the cost?<br />Love is a mortal sin and the secrets of the past prove deadly as Clary and Jace face down Valentine in the final installment of the New York Times bestselling trilogy The Mortal Instruments.<br /><br />This is the third installment in the Mortal Instruments Series (City of Bones, City of Ashes). If you haven't read them yet...do it now! I love this fantasy series and highly recommend it for anyone who likes romance or fantasy especially if you like the \\"forbidden love\\" theme a la books like Stephanie Meyers Twilight series. There are a lot of interesting diverse characters and every otherworld creature you could think of from demons and vampires to werewolves and angels. I had a few questions at the end and it seemed to me that there was some plot lines left open but I know there is a prequel in the works and maybe we'll find out more. But like I said, read these books you won't be disappointed!
B00005ATZT|3.0|No doubt about it this is a great movie. It was nominated for Best Picture in '93. But my three star review is for the poor quality dvd. The picture is very grainy. I'm waiting for Warner Brothers to come out with a better quality dvd, maybe a 20th aniversary edition-where they can use a better quality copy of the film for the dvd transfer. And from what I understand the Blueray version is not much better.
B001NESPHC|5.0|This is her best album yet.  She sounds confident and true.  Great songs! Great purchase.
B000002JSN|2.0|May 2009:<br /><br />The epitome of Classic Rock.  My favorite Zep album.  Possibly responsible for most of my hearing loss...  What was the question?<br /><br />Oh yeh.  Been looking at the $25 CD-set for decades, but I wasn't sold.  Then, I see Amazon has an MP3 download for $12, and I bought it in a second.  It's 256 kilobits-per-second, which is good enough for my aching eardrums (Zep's fault, I'll betchya) and my computer speakers.  The mp3 audio-level is well chosen for plenty of dynamic range for when Bonham beats one of his big drums.<br /><br />June 2013:<br /><br />I wrote a short, lavishing, 5-star review on this mp3 four years ago.  I'm retracting it.  Two stars, buddies, because Amazon damaged the reproduction, so the mp3 file stinks.  Amazon's definition of 2 Stars is \\"I Don't Like It.\\"<br /><br />Many of the songs begin with a short guitar solo, and then the bass and drums join in.  And when they do join in, the overall volume level drops.  I.e., just because the bass and drums join in, that's no reason for the guitar's volume to drop.  It wasn't recorded that way; it wasn't released that way.<br /><br />And there are plenty of other examples of the volume levels being increased and decreased besides most-distractingly at the beginnings of songs.<br /><br />I expect that kind of cheap compression to come out of an FM broadcast station, because that is exactly what this volume-manipulation sounds like.  Is that where Amazon got this material, recorded off an FM receiver?  Because someone did some continually annoying volume-tinkering on this.<br /><br />Man, I've spent years with this file turning down the levels on earlier audio-amplification stages, and turning down levels on the bass, and compensating by turning up levels on later audio amplification stages trying to stop the compression.  Finally, I just turned down everything and listened, and the compression is uneffected -- it's in the mp3 file, not in my equipment.<br /><br />I intended to purchase a digital version of this album, but not a digital version where someone tinkered with the levels.  It wasn't necessary to screw around; there's no excuse for it.  And now, 4 wasted years later (and when I say \\"wasted,\\" I mean that in the bad way, and when I say \\"bad\\" I mean \\"bad\\"), the question is if I can find a way through Amazon's maze of links to tell 'em what I think of them destroying an album that was supposed to be serious flashback material, but it never materialized because of their fiddling and botching.<br /><br />Today, the \\"Most Critical Review\\" is from a self-described not-so-audiophillic guy who is more vague about the damaged audio engineering that went into this mp3, and his conclusion is that he's not buying any more mp3s from Amazon.  Someone please remind me to do the same -- no more Amazon mp3s, unless I'll be satisfied with dissatisfaction.
B001974DG0|5.0|Dean Koontz can be brilliant, medicocre, and occasionally pretty bad. (I couldn't even finish \\"Your Heart Belongs to Me\\"). But when he gets it right, he gets is really, really right. This book is a joy on every level. The characters are engaging people the reader would love to know, the plot is compelling, and the narrative is top-of-his game Koontz. This story is one of gripping ideas, told in a setting of the transcendance of love and courage over evil and misfortune.<br /><br />If you don't have a dog when you read this, go buy some Alpo. You'll want to get a diog when you are done.

B001UREJWM|5.0|I got the Black Sabbath The Dio Years and was please they were working together but really thought that there was going to be a tour and then that would be it.   I thought that the new songs on that cd were ok but I honestly didn't get what they were trying to do.  I had no idea this thing was coming out until a few weeks before hand so I was looking forward to listening to it.  When I put this cd into my drive my first thought was \\"uggg\\".  I thought the sound was just too thick to handle.  I made a rule for myself though.  I promised myself that I   would never write a cd review unless I had listened to a cd 4 to 5 times completely through. I think it only fair and I'm glad that I did.   There are only 10 songs on this disc.  Who does that anymore?  The song arrangement on the cd is non-typical since they didn't follow the usual formula of fast song, slow song, medium, etc.  As a matter of fact, the cd might be a little bottom heavy in that respect.  The mix is unusual in pop metal.  Dio.  This is dense, muddy, sticky, lump stuff.  The guitars are heavy and the wrifs imaginative but don't look for a lot of shredder buzzkill or divebomb leads. Geezer's bass is still playing the blues. Though the drums are solid quality they rarely get a chance to shine on this cd, but then again this is Vinny Appice.  The lyrics are much more in the style of this line up rather than Dio since Geezer's also in on the lyrics writing along with I have always thought that they made a great writing pair.  Giving this cd a few listens forced me to go back and listen to the new songs on the Sabs Dio Years cd and suddenly I got it.  Lol  These aren't people \\"doing\\" Sabbath.  If you can't dig this cd then you should ask yourself what \\"kind\\" of heavy metal you like.    All of the songs are deliberately heavy and make welcome additions to the BS library.  This wouldn't be a surprise for Sab fans IF the vocals are \\"there\\" but with the ever-strong Ronnie James Dio on vocals it's specifically a statement of what heavy metal is/was and should be without ever saying heavy metal in one of the songs.  Give yourself a chance to dive into this one.  It's like quicksand but it's awesome.  I'd like to pre-pay for their next two cds.  I hope they make it that far.  Yep, this ones my new favorite. I'm excited for metal that this cd is out.
B001MEJY8W|4.0|Another movie that you should go watch right now without reading another word.  In particular, don't look for it on Youtube because there are major spoilers up there.  For me \\"Martyrs\\" didn't quite live up to its hype for being gut-wrenching (\\"[[ASIN:B0009WFEDC Audition]]\\" got much deeper under my skin), but it did live up to its hype for smarts.  Make no mistake, this is primarily a bit of grindhouse nastiness, but \\"Martyrs\\" also plays with the conventions of horror films in a masterful way.  Halfway through you think you know exactly where the movie is going, and then it goes somewhere else entirely.  Recommended, but the less you know going in the better.
B001P4KXXO|5.0|I choose this rating because I've thought Prima was one of a kind performer...I haven't found anyone that could compare with his energy and his stage presence...Besides he was the first show that I had seen in las Vegas about 50 years ago...His unique voice, animation and his band were the best... I recommend it for Prima fans or those who appreciate a fine musician and performer..
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|I have been waiting ever since this movie came available on DVD at Wal-Mart for the price to come down but it is still $20+ there and I got it brand new from Amazon.com for less than $9.00 including shipping and handling. Also it is a Great action movie
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|Beverly Hills Chihuahua was wonderful, especially good for dog owners who associate the word \\"family\\" instead of \\"Pet\\" to their 4 legged family member.    Taken was a thriller which kept your attention and on the edge of your seat the entire film; this is one dude I would never want to get on the wrong side!  I'm not use to seeing Liam Neeson in a role quite like this but he had me scared!
B001M5UDGS|3.0|I may have been a victim of overhype.  So many claimed this was up there with Joss Whedon's best work.  I enjoyed it but wasn't blown away.  Kind of a rehash of the Buffy episode \\"Once More With Feeling.\\"  Definitely worth a look, even the commentary is sung!!!
B000VDDWDS|4.0|The actual Blu-Ray movie is excellent, as well as the soundtrack. Comments on Blu Ray PQ lacking is probably due to the way it was shot, especially with the night and interior scenes in low light. The story, as most agree, is probably the best rendition of period naval warfare done in modern cinema. It has the same realistic treatment of battle scenes that [[ASIN:B000PAAJVA The Patriot (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray]]] did with cannon based land warfare. But where are all the extras that are in the [[ASIN:B0001DI0FI Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]]? It just bugs me that the studios churn out something like this fast and seemingly without thought, and leave great content out or don't even add anything new. The same thing with JFK, which now has this awesome regular DVD [[ASIN:B001DJ7PN2 JFK (Ultimate Collector's Edition)]] and a Blu Ray edition that comes out at almost the same time with almost none of the extra material.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is one of those rare occurrences where the movie is better than the book. I am a hopeless romantic and this film tugged at my heart strings. Some parts are a bit sappy, but overall the story is fantastic.

0446607274|4.0|Angels Flight is another solid entry in the Harry Bosch series.  It's got an interesting but very slow first half.  When the second half of this story starts, look out.

B001K3JF7K|3.0|Several years ago after hearing her version of Nat Cole's \\"Frim Fram Sauce\\", I bought Diana Krall's \\"All For You\\" ... which is an excellent album I'd recommend for anyone's collection. So I got \\"Steppin' Out\\", \\"Only Trust Your Heart\\", \\"Love Scenes\\", and \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\" ... all with some nice piano trio work that worked well with her vocals.<br /><br />Since I liked all the others, when \\"The Look of Love\\" came ought I bought it, too. Besides, the cover of that album flat sizzles, ifyaknowhatimean. Ouch!<br /><br />With this album more than any other to that point, though, she went more to orchestration and away from the piano trio format -- which is where she shines (with the later, not the former). But it'll hold a special place in my collection and get played with the first four, which is probably a tribute to the brilliant marketer who had her pose just so in that black dress and those heels.<br /><br />Since then she's gone mainly to torch songs and Jobim sambas. Great material, to be sure. And I'm as big a Jobim fan as anyone. It worked well with the Christmas album, \\"Christmas Songs\\" which is a perennial in my collection. But even on that her vocals had a jazzier spark to them on several of the tracks even if she was away from piano central. Ok, and the green dress and heels didn't hurt, either. Same marketer, I presume.<br /><br />But with each new album, Christmas album aside, I've been hoping she'd go back to the trio format. She's a good jazz musician. This arranged stuff boxes her in. And she has a pleasant voice ... I mean, I like it. It's better when she's belting a song out than it is when she's sighing one. That worked for Astrud Gilberto. But not everyone is Astrud. It's just not bringing anything interesting to the material in this format.<br /><br />And so it was with \\"Quiet Nights\\", which just came out a couple of months ago. I was again hoping she'd be tickling the keys and leaning into the piano with some of the old gusto... but no. This has got to be the breathiest, most arranged album to date. Pleasant background dinner music, to be sure. But a far cry from her early work.<br /><br />Maybe this is what's in demand and it's how she can rake in the big money, which is totally understandable. Or maybe this is really what she wants to do... which would be totally understandable as well. But it isn't lighting a fire under my rear to go out and buy any more Diana Krall. Me, personally. I've never been one of those fans who has the audacity to tell an artist what they should do. I'm just personally disappointed. Still, I have the early albums to listen to, and my collection is richer for it.ranged album to date. Pleasant background dinner music, to be sure. But a far cry from her early work.

0802798225|5.0|This book was one of the most amazing books Ive read. It was filled with details that never let me put down the book and I was envious of Brittney for having such a guy like Alex.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this CD to familiarize myself with the music before I saw the musical at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago last November.  Since then, I've popped this back in the changer repeatedly, enjoying the music more as it becomes familiar.  It combines great variety including quite a bit of humor as on this lyric from \\"The Wizard & I,\\" \\"Do you think the Wizard is dumb, or like Munchkins, just small-minded.\\"  \\"Popular\\" is such an upbeat number that it never fails to cheer with Kristen Chenoweth's bubbly vocals.  \\"Defying Gravity\\" -- that I recall as the first act closer -- builds intensely.  Joel Grey played the Wizard on the soundtrack while I saw Gene Weygandt in the Chicago production.  The Wizard's vocals on the lighthearted \\"Wonderful\\" are lovely, \\"Elphaba, where I'm from, we believe all sorts of things that aren't true; We call it history.\\"  \\"No Good Deed\\" highlights the clash in the action.  My perception about the musical was that it tackled the subject of racism with many objecting to Elphaba because she was green and the animals because they were -- well, animals.  \\"Wicked\\" is a stunning musical experience, well worth checking out if like me you're coming to appreciate it a bit late in the game.  Enjoy!
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen is essentially a Super Hero murder mystery. It's a very dark, gritty look at superheroes and the world they live in. The characters are developed very well and the story relies on the specific characters it creates. While many of the characters are based on other, more recognizable ones, the writer (Alan Moore) manages to give each of them a very unique persona unlike the heroes they're based on.<br /><br />I will say that the art isn't the reason for liking this book. I was initially turned off by the coloring. It could definitely use an update in the color and shading areas. However, the actual line work art is very good and consistent and you've got to hand it to the artist, Dave Gibbons, for the shear amount of panels in this book, most of the pages using a 9 panel layout.<br /><br />It's one of those books that when you finish reading it you want to talk about it with someone.<br /><br />I would say this book is one of the essential reads for anyone interested in comics, superheroes, or just plain good writing and story telling.
1401207529|5.0|Frank Miller is very good at making human characters. Never before have you seen this Batman. This tells the tale of when Batman first dons the cowl. This is Batman who makes a lot of mistakes, who is looking to find his path, and is beginning to make his mark on Gotham City. It also tells of how James Gordon gets his start in Gotham. A very intriguing story from beginning to end.

B001GM28HO|3.0|. . . and that sums up what \\"The Fame\\" is all about.  For me, anyway.  I realize I am in the minority in not liking this album, and so, to determine whether or not our tastes match and this review will be helpful to you, consider a song like \\"Poker Face.\\"  Is it just me, or is there something about that song that leaves you feeling hollow?  I don't think it's all that catchy and, well, it just isn't fun.  It isn't easy, breezy, and groovin' . . . or fluffy and frivolously sweet . . . or charismatically pummeling, tough, and intense.  It doesn't have emotion.  It's weird.  To me, it sounds and feels empty.  Like it was composed by and sung by a robot.  You can't get inside the track and find a real, flesh-and-blood person behind the pop-star facade.  The rest of the album comes from that same emotionally vacant place.<br /><br />Before I write of this album completely, I would like to recommend three tracks that I thought were actually very good: \\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich,\\" \\"Summerboy,\\" and \\"The Fame.\\"  You can still hear the same detached, (frankly unlikeable!) person at work, but I thought the grooves and hooks were good enough to make up for it.  I would also like to give dibs to Lady Gaga for 1) having a good singing voice and 2) being in control of her arty image and sexuality (as opposed to stars who, um, owe their styling to greedy producers and parents.)<br /><br />Finally, if you love pop music, you should hear this record and form your own opinion about it.  While the lyrics are hopelessly banal, (she sings about sex, ambition, money, and the club scene with about the imagination of a tree stump), the beats, production, and singing are quite good.  I can see why some people like this album; it is stylish.  However, for me, the songs were too heartless to be fun.  And once a pop song ceases to be fun, there really is no point in listening to it, is there?
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, but I've seen better.  However, my three year old son absolutely loved it.  I think he enjoyes watching all of the rats running around, because the script was not that impressive.
B0000041XX|4.0|[[ASIN:B000JFZ9G6 The Italian Opera Collection]]This is one of the best examples of the Three Tenors that I have come accross in a long time; so much so, that I bought the CD instead of downloading it. I bought it in the first for Pavrotti, but the others are quiet good, esspecially Carreras.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Season 1 was neat, unique, funny, gruesome and it totally sucked me in. I thought...Season 2 won't be as good. It was. The writers did a good job of keeping it interesting where other shows would've slumped off and killed the series.

B0018CWEYY|3.0|I loved this season. For me this show just keeps getting better and better. My only problem was the quality of the DVD's. Disc four skips on me all the time and I can't watch all of the bonus features on disc five because it crashes on me. For what I payed for stuff like this pisses me off.
B001HN69AE|5.0|This movie gets such a bad rep, but for what it is, it's a great movie. I mean, It's a remake of a 150 episode series. Considering in the US the original is mostly unknown outside of fans, and Z is well known as an action show, many of the changes can be overlooked. And anyway, it's a remake, it's not supposed to be exactly the same, that would be boring. Can't wait for the BD.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I had concerns that this flash would not have the power to do the job of lighting up a large dance floor in a NYC Club. I'm not sure how this would perform on a Nikon D2x, however, on a Nikon D5000 it's a perfect match.<br /><br />Match this flash with the D5000, a $75.00 Stroboframe camera flip bracket, a $50.00 Nikon flash cable (don't get the cable with the focus assist)and pick up a $17.00 Sto-Fen Omni Bounce designed for this flash. You'll have a fully capable flash system. You won't regret it.<br /><br />For moving around very crowed clubs, photojournalism, and the like, I can't think of a more capable, comfortable, and affordable camera outfit.<br /><br />Don't worry about the lack of controls on the flash itself. The way the D5000 and this flash functions together will please you much. Especially if you are use to constantly adjusting and setting an external shoe mount flash. The flash is fully controllable from the camera.<br /><br />Also, you don't have to worry for the safety of the flash as much when mounted on a bracket (or the camera) when moving through crowds.<br /><br />Compared to a $200.00 to $300.00 flash, getting this flash for your Nikon D5000 only makes good sense.
B000MGATTE|2.0|Lisey Debusher Landon has lost her husband Scott. He was a famous writer and Lisey lived a quite life in his shadow. Never did she complain when she had to travel along on those numerous literary tours because she always enjoyed the deep love they felt for each other. Two years ago Scott suddenly died and Lisey's life came to a sudden standstill. Now it is finally time to clean out his office and make sure that the unpublished work of her husband is getting in the right hands. But that seems not as easy as it looks. When she gets some threatening calls she realizes that is all becomes too serious. At the same time history catches up with her and it becomes clear that her dearest Scott possessed powers that will make normal people insane.<br /><br />As a big Stephen King fan this novel was a really tough nut to crack. For starters it is quite a heavy piece of writing. With more than 500 pages it is simply too long. Certainly if you see what is actually occurring in the book. Notwithstanding some quite horrific scenes the main part is a lot of romantic and feely-touchy rambling. On top of that King uses a plethora of silly, non-existing and most of the time meaningless words, as such that the joy of reading quickly disappears completely. For the romantic souls it all might be interesting and enjoyable, but then again the horrific stuff might not be their cup of tea. Whereas for a horror fan it will certainly turn out to be a bit too lame. I can believe that King intended this novel as a tribute to all writers and their symbolic lake of inspiration, but for me it never reached the impact that On Writing, his non-fiction tribute to the art of writing, has brought over me.<br /><br />It really hurts me to say this, but Lisey's Story will not be a book that I will reread very soon.
0545003636|3.0|I'm a collector of children's books and the parent of avid readers, one of whom will read anything with science in it and the other who will read anything historical. I'm also a doll carver, and am fascinated with joints and mechanics; especially automata. When I read a review of this book it sounded wonderful, so I bought it on CD and we listened together. I am familiar with Brian Selznick's illustrations, and love them. The cover of the book is a good example of his inventive style. I hesitated to buy the cd for this reason but ended up glad I didn't have to be put off by the distractingly amateurish drawings. Indeed, when I watched the bonus DVD I found myself fixated on how the children's noses changed in every picture.     One sentence in, we all had a visceral reaction that prompted this conversation:   \\"Ewwww, who is reading this? Their voice is SO patronizing!\\"  \\"The author okayed this?\\"   \\"The author is the one reading this.\\"   \\"Huh? What age is it written for?\\"  \\"9-12\\"  \\"He makes him sound a lot younger\\"    A short while later it was:  \\"The sound affects are distracting and affected. I don't like them\\".     I myself kind of liked them but my kids did not. They, BTW, were 13 and 17, but have always enjoyed books for all ages.     My 17 yo son dropped out 1/4 of the way through. My daughter and I finished the book for the sole reason that we wanted to know how it ended. It seemed to go on forever, and although the author suggested tantalizing possibilities of so many places it might go, it never followed any of these leads - instead it merely fizzled. George Melies in particular was portrayed in a way that was both vague and disturbing, as if Mr. Selznick thought he might have a mental illness, but wasn't sure which one, so he merely hinted at a number of them.     What was particularly disappointing to me was that I researched George Melies after we finished the book, and discovered he as a real person, who really made automata, and also that the automata described in the book is not only real, it is the most advanced example ever discovered. This automata is not made by George Melies (he destroyed his) but by a Swiss man named Maillardet. I became eager to find and see this piece for myself. I watched the bonus DVD that came with the cds in hopes Mr. Seznick would show it, and tell where it can be found now. Perhaps he even would include swoon) video of it? Nope. Just a dry description of how he came to write the book. Actually, here is where  he somewhat redeems himself. Although this DVD is dry, it contains some valuable tips for young writers on how to research and plan a book. It is clear he did research and plan the book, quite well, in fact. So what happened - perhaps he planned so much that it killed the story?     One month after reading the book my family went on vacation to Philadelphia, and while visiting the Franklin Institute, we turned a corner and came face to face with THE automata from the book. I gasped. What serendipity! Along with the piece itself, there was a video that showed it in operation and examples of all 7 of it's poems and drawings. The best tidbits of the book - including many avenues Mr. Selznick never explored, turn out to be real parts of the story. Was he uncomfortable with telling the true story, so he made up one that was very much a lesser version? Did he feel the story required a boy? Fine, if so, but there are far better, less intrusive ways to write one in.     When we came home, I found videos about the automata AND Mr. Selznick on YouTube, and after that on Selznick's own website [...] . Apparently the museum allowed him to thoroughly examine the automata. When they did so, the original writing instrument was found.     The three stars I give this book are not for the writing, but for introducing the world to the story of Melies and this automata. He also gets marks for describing his process in a useful, albeit boring, way. The basic story isn't terrible, even with the cheap trick of killing off the boy's parents - a pet peeve I have with children's books.  Even with this flaw, the story was both meaty and juicy. So how did the final product end up being a pile of dry bones? The effect the illustrations had on me was to make the story even drier and dustier. Why on earth were shaded pencil sketches chosen to drive such a (potentially) exciting story? And if they were, why weren't they done in sketchbook style, as if done by Melies?    I suspect Mr. Selznick has no children, or is not very connected with them if he does. His character never reads like a 12 year old. He reads as much more childish - perhaps 9? but he supposedly was able to restore the world's most complicated automata with parts stolen from a toy shop? That disrespect for the *team* of *highly skilled* individuals who actually DID restore this machine, but took *4 years* to do so, really irked me.     Mr. Selznick wrote a long book with a potentially complex story, and the publisher set an age range ( 9-12) to fit that. However, the story is better suited to putting children of about 6 or 7 to sleep - and likely to nightmares, given that the only life in the book was relegated to dead parents, a drunk and missing uncle, homelessness, hunger, etc.  I blame the editor of this piece as much as I blame Mr. Selznick for actually ruining a potentially first class book.     Mr. Selznick says he got his original inspiration from Edison's Eve by Gaby Woods.  I have ordered that book and hope it delivers what this did not.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is truely a spectacular nature documentary. Probably the best nature documentary to date. I rented this from Netflix, and knew right away that I had to buy this! The underwater and whale scenes are stunning in blu-ray clarity and will leave you in awe. The landscapes are breath-taking and glorious.  It captures nature in fascinating and bizarre ways. Beautiful, educational, touching, - truely a masterpiece! It is well worth any price to me.  I gained a new appreciation for nature, and learned just how extraordinary our planet is!  Buy this! You will not be sorry.
0553582038|5.0|There is great potential here.  GRRM is a fantastic story teller.  Tough, very believable and gritty, he's laid the groundwork for possibly one of the greatest fantasy novels ever written.  GRRM's talent for naming things and his verbiage is unsurpassed.  Names such as Aegon the Conqueror, his daughter Daenarys Targaryen, Jaqen H'ghar of the Faceless Men and his saying of Valar Morghulis, Ser Arthur Dayne \\"The Sword of the Morning,\\" Stennis Baratheon, Gregor and Sandor Clegane, Tywin Lannister and of course everyone's personal favorite Tyrion - names such as these bring the book to life.  The naming of the characters and places show a depth of understanding seldom seen since Tolkien's Middle Earth.  Martin deserves credit for his understanding of Celtic-Gaelic naming patterns and this alone distinguishes him from other would be medieval fiction writers.  The way he writes, I honestly believe sometimes that Martin must have been there.      On the negative side - the story seems to be getting dragged out for no apparent reason, especially in A Feast for Crows (AFFC).  Rumor has it that AFFC focused on Southern Westeros and ADWD will focus on Northern Westeros.  My biggest complaint is that the central characters need to have more interaction or else they will continue to wander around Westeros without ever coming into contact with each other.      I am hoping the plot can advance in the next installment.  I highly recommend the series.  I recommend that you listen to it on audiobook as opposed to the printed version, especially if you are just taking up the series.
1905654294|2.0|It actually took me some time to define my opinion about this book. There are so many people who hate it (seems like about a third of those who have read Twilight series) and even more of those who love it. Few are in between.<br /><br />Although I haven't been a Twilight die-hard fan, I enjoyed books 1-3 quite a bit. Just like everybody else, I skipped through them propably in a week. I never disillusioned myself about SM's quality of writing, but yet, we all have to admit, there is something about these books that just draws you in.<br /><br />And then, I started reading Breaking Dawn. I didn't have any kind of high expectations, but like everybody else, I knew there were things that were destined to happen based on the story lines of previous three books (just the same way we knew that, let's say, Harry Potter would take a stand against Voldemort). This things were: wedding, consummation (don't lie to yourself, this is what we all were looking forward to!), Bella becoming a vampire, Volturi's claim on Alice, Edward and Bella.<br /><br />All these were touched upon in BD, but the that was all, just a touch. These events never became a focal point of the plot of the last book in the series. All these issues did come up and were resolved instantly, without any hesitation or struggle. Nobody opposed the wedding; wedding night went almost without a hitch, lacked romance, intimacy, or any kind of details; Bella became the bestest vampire ever and never experienced bloodthirst everybody was warning her about.<br /><br />So what is left to drive the story? This is where comes in the craziest, most absurd and illogical \\"twist\\" that so many fans defend - Renesmee (did I spell this right?). Her existance didn't make any sense, her presence killed the romance story we all loved so much.<br /><br />Impossible pregnancy aside, what surprised and disappointed me the most about this last installment was total lack of any kind of believable conflict (peaceful Volturi standoff instead), but abandance of useless narrative (J.Jenks storyline, Jacob'Seth'Leah endless patrols, numerous new vampires with special talents nobody cared about).<br /><br />I won't go as far as to rate this book at 0 or 1. There were few entertaining scenes, and the book did give some semblance of closure. But this closure was similar to the one you get from reading fanfiction. Yes, it shows you your favorite characters happy, but you know it's not the real thing, the real book would have been so much better and truer to the story. But unfortunately, we will never read that \\"real\\" Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />Many fans defend this books saying that this is SM's story and she wrote it the way she wanted it to be written. That's fine, but looks like this story of hers wasn't all that good.<br /><br />The saddest thing about Breaking Dawn is that it managed to alienate so many dedicated fans. I've never heard of such a thing before, honestly. It pains me to see how many fans now try to find solace in making fun of SM and the entire series. Very sad...<br /><br />Breaking Dawn could have cemented S. Meyer as a great storyteller, instead, this book exposed her (in my opinion) as an extremely weak writer. What does future hold for her? I think next book will be vital in her career. Hopefully rumors about \\"cannibal mermaids\\" books on the boards are not true...tead), but abandance of useless narrative (J.Jenks storyline, Jacob'Seth'Leah endless patrols, numerous new vampires with special talents nobody cared about).<br /><br />I won't go as far as to rate this book at 0 or 1.

Very sad...<br /><br />Breaking Dawn could have cemented S. Meyer as a great storyteller, instead, this book exposed her (in my opinion) as an extremely weak writer. What does future hold for her? I think next book will be vital in her career. Hopefully rumors about \\"cannibal mermaids\\" books on the boards are not true...

B00013RC66|2.0|Black Widow (Bob Rafelson, 1987)<br /><br />I seem to be one of the few people who never quite got the obsession film viewers had with Ken and Theresa Russell. I'd heard Black Widow, in which Theresa plays the title character, bandied about for years as the height of sexy thriller-dom, so I finally got around to checking it out. While it's not a completely awful movie, it's not all that great, either.<br /><br />Russell plays Catherine Petersen, a very rich lady who got that way when her previous husbands died under very mysterious circumstances. On the opposite side of the fence is Alexandra Barnes (Debra Winger), a Federal agent who, as the beginning of the movie progresses (and as we see the mysterious circumstances under which her latest late husband, played by Dennis Hopper, meets his end), becomes obsessed with tracking Petersen down and bringing her to task. Her boss (Terry O'Quinn) is worried that her obsession is clouding her judgment, so he orders her to take a vacation. She chooses Hawaii, which just happens to be where Petersen is wooing her potential next victim. Things get more comlicated when Alex falls for him as well.<br /><br />And really, do we need more complexity than that? Whether we do or not, Ronald Bass' script gives it to us in spades. (Wait'll you see the climax, which is just beyond silly.) But despite all that, it's quite a pretty thing, as you'd have to expect from any film that's half-set in Hawaii (to be fair, it's probably more beautiful because Alex's office is so dingy), and both Winger and Russell overact this thing halfway to heaven. Oh, so stupid, but it's the kind of empty-calorie movie that once you've started, you just can't stop. **

B00003CX8V|5.0|The Apartment (Billy Wilder, 1960)<br /><br />When the subject of the greatest director in American history comes up, the usual suspects come out of their holes with the usual assertions. When you look at thousand-best-movie lists and narrow them down to movies made in America, the same two names pop up over and over again: Alfred Hitchcock and Woody Allen. While Hitch, obviously, was British, most of his films were made in America, and so I hope I can be forgiven for calling him American when it comes to his movies. As with Hitch, then, obviously, with the German director Billy Wilder. Wilder, despite having made some of the best-loved films in American history, always seems to get overlooked when this debate comes up. I have no idea why; pretty much everything that the man did is a classic. I have yet to see the Wilder film that isn't brilliant, and The Apartment is no exception.<br /><br />C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is a hack at an insurance agency, a bachelor who works long hours simply because he has nothing better to do. One evening, he allows a work colleague to use his apartment for a tryst with a woman who is not his wife. Word gets out, and soon Baxter's apartment is the place of choice for colleagues in the same situation. Things get a bit complicated when his boss (Fred MacMurray) finds out about the arrangement and starts using the apartment as well. Meanwhile, Baxter has struck up a friendship with attractive elevator girl Fran (Shirley MacLaine), and he hopes to take it farther. Then he finds out that his boss' girlfriend is none other than Fran. How many more ways can his job be in jeopardy?<br /><br />It's a nasty topic, and in 1960 it was positively scandalous. Wilder offsets the outrage of the thing by turning the material into a comedy, and a very funny one it is. When, of course, it's not playing your heartstrings. Baxter, as the film begins, is a truly pathetic individual, and Wilder and his longtime collaborator, screenwriter IAL Diamond, initially play this for all the comedic value they can. But as Baxter runs into conflict after conflict, basically forcing him to grow a spine, his character's pathos is played more and more seriously. After all, such a tenuous situation is bound to induce some serious incidents. When they occur, they never feel forced, and more impressively they never feel out of place. Everything here grows organically out of what's come before. Nothing is too convenient or too precious; it all hangs together perfectly.<br /><br />And then there is the acting. Wilder was a genius at taking the A-list actors of his day and managing to coax them into giving performances that were just that little bit better than they'd ever managed to come up with before. MacLaine was still, relatively, the new kid on the block, and no one really knew what to expect from her, especially when put up against such heavyweights as Lemmon and MacMurray (both of whom had teamed successfully with Wilder in the past, Lemmon the year before in Some Like it Hot and MacMurray, of course, in Double Indemnity). To say she held her own would be quite the understatement; she was nominated for Best Actress, losing to Elizabeth Taylor. (The movie did take home five Oscars, including Best Picture of 1960; it was nominated for ten.) As well, aside from the three leads was a wealth of talent in the supporting roles, including Ray Walston, Jack Kruschen, and Edie Adams, among others, all of whom turn in performances as impressive as one would expect in a Billy Wilder movie.<br /><br />As with every Billy Wilder movie I've seen (save The Lost Weekend), I simply can't say enough good things about this movie. Want a romantic comedy with real bite? Skip whatever's playing at your local cinemaplex and rent The Apartment instead. It is a superlative example of the genre, arguably the best romantic comedy ever made in America. **** ½he comedic value they can.

B000RJO578|4.0|Hot Fuzz (Edgar Wright, 2007)<br /><br />I expected to like Hot Fuzz, the second feature by the same comedy team (Wright, Pegg, and Frost) who brought us Shaun of the Dead in 2004. What I didn't expect was that under the comedy, which we assumed we'd get from these very funny guys, would actually be a cracking mystery that would hold my interest just as much as Pegg and Frost's banter.<br /><br />Plot: Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a cop's cop, the kind of guy who can make a mugger put down the purse and back away just by cocking an eyebrow. Problem is, he's making the rest of his department look bad, so they conspire to get him sent to Sandford, a quiet town in the country well-known for its low crime rate. He gets off to a great start when he gets there by finding one of the town's rare crimes; he's not even on the force yet, but he ends up hauling in a guy for drunk driving. Of course, the next morning, he finds out that the guy he hauled in is his new partner, Danny Butterman (Frost). Sandford's police force is very laid-back; why shouldn't they be? After all, the town has almost no crime. That doesn't sit well with Angel's type A personality, of course, so he starts looking around to see if there's anything the lackluster bobbies around him have simply been overlooking. With Danny as his reluctant accomplice, Angel starts investigating a series of accidents he finds suspicious. Together, the two of them get closer and closer to what's looking like a major conspiracy. Their challenge then becomes figuring out who's behind the conspiracy before those unknowns can stop their investigation permanently.<br /><br />Put Pegg, Wright, and Frost together and you're basically guaranteed a good time. Shaun of the Dead was a brilliant send-up of zombie films, but really, when it came right down to it, it was a straight comedy, albeit one that was fantastically made. Hot Fuzz, while just as hysterical as Shaun, is not a straight comedy at all, and shows the versatility of Wright as a director, Frost and Pegg as actors, and all three of them as co-writers. Sure, you come for the comedy, and the movie delivers as expected on that front, but this is a whodunit that's got some teeth as well, and what a pleasant surprise that is. A definite recommendation, even for those who, for whatever reason, didn't like Shaun. ****d Pegg as actors, and all three of them as co-writers.

B00288KNLS|4.0|Coraline (Henry Selick, 2009)<br /><br />Henry Selick's greatest achievement until now is sadly neglected--the great The Nightmare Before Christmas. Why neglected, you ask? Because, thanks in large part to its stylistic tricks and the presence of Danny Elfman, ask ten fans of the movie who directed it, and you'll get nine people who say \\"Tim Burton.\\" (Burton was actually the writer of the story upon which the movie is based, after a brilliant adaptation by Michael McDowell.) There can be little doubt that Burton had a profound influence on Selick, given his later work, but Selick has proven himself quite capable of standing on his own. Here, he partners up with another dark-fantasy great, Neil Gaiman, for an adaptation of one of Gaiman's finest novels, Coraline. And I have to say, this is the best film I saw on the big screen since El Laberinto del Fauno. Selick, who also wrote the screen adaptation, nails Gaiman's book in a way I wasn't sure could be done.<br /><br />Plot: Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) and her family move to a spooky old boardinghouse in the middle of nowhere thanks to her mother (voice of Teri Hatcher)'s new writing assignment. While she does make a tentative new friend, the nerdy Wybie (voice of The Happening's Robert Bailey Jr.), she's roundly unsatisfied with her home life, and wishes she could find something better. That night, she discovers a tunnel into an alternate dimension, where she meets analogues of her mother and father (voice of Daily Show regular John Hodgman) who seem to have no interest other than pleasing her. The only other denizen of the house who can travel between the two worlds is a cat (voice of Keith David), who cautions Coraline that not all is as it seems. Coraline is willing to forego warnings for cake, but with the help of some of the house's more eccentric inhabitants, Coraline discovers that not all is, in fact, as it seems.<br /><br />The house's other inhabitants are brought to life wonderfully, and with incredible talent (French and Saunders in fine form, Ian McShane), but it's Fanning and Bailey who steal the show here; they bring a magic to these characters that's rare even in live action. I tend to think of voicing animation as the opposite of silent film; rather than having no voice and having to get things across with exaggerated gesture, you have no gesture at all, and have to get things across with voice. Voice, however, is more subtle, and overdoing it can kill a movie (or a series, as anyone who's seen English-dubbed anime series can attest). Fanning has already proven herself an accomplished voice actress, but it's hard to believe this is Bailey's first outing. Good stuff, indeed. Hatcher is right at home playing a desperate housewife, of course, and French and Saunders just do what they do best, and it works. Heck, the whole cast have themselves a great time here, and it shows. It's all backed up with Selick's trademark creepy animation, that works just as well here as it did in The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. (It may be heresy, but I'll note it, at least in passing; the film is currently rated a tenth of a point higher at IMDB than is The Nightmare Before Christmas. Shocking!) As a side note, making Teri Hatcher's character look like, well, Teri Hatcher will be an extra kick for Desperate Housewives fans.<br /><br />In the afterword to the novel, Gaiman notes that while adults are likely to read it as a horror novel, children see it more as an adventure, and tend not to be scared by it. This is one aspect of the book that Selick didn't translate, and my thirteen-year-old daughter (who is rapidly becoming a connoisseur of bad horror films, just like her dad) was extremely creeped out by a few scenes towards the climax of the film. You may want to shoo the younger kiddies out of the room before watching this, but no matter. The adults will be just as charmed by it as the older kids will be.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Let the Right One In (Tomas Alfredson, 2008)<br /><br />When trying to convince my sister-in-law and daughter, both thirteen, to watch this fantastic film, at one point I got tired of trying to do so with my usual critical terms and just said, \\"it's Twilight, but good.\\" Which, of course, scandalized them both, but when it comes right down to it, there are a great number of similarities between the two films' themes, but the execution is almost polar opposite. Film buffs will detect, for example, hints of Kieslowski in Tomas Alfredson's location choices. I defy anyone to say that about Twilight (and be able to back it up).<br /><br />The plot should sound familiar, if you're in America (since it seems everyone in the country has either seen Twilight, read the book, or both): a young human falls in love with a young vampire, who returns that love, but realizes that a true match between them is impossible. Where Stephenie Meyer's sparkly vampires, on the one hand, want to be RomEmo and Juliet, it seems as if John Ajvide Lindqvist (adapting his own novel) simply said \\"hey, how about we write your basic love story, but give it an undead twist?\\" Ironically, the one that doesn't try so hard is the one, if either of them does, that will end up the classic. Oh, yeah, and Eli (Lina Leandersson in her first film role)? She don't sparkle. However, similar to Twilight, there's a scene where the human finds out what happens to the vampire during one of those times that are traditionally supposed to be bad for vampires. And, like Twilight, that scene is one of the movie's most memorable. But trust me, there ain't no sparkling.<br /><br />I don't even know where to begin saying great things about this movie, so I'll start with the obvious: the two young actors playing Eli, the vampire, and Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant), her human friend. I absolutely, positively cannot believe neither of these two has acted in professional movies before this. They are absolutely perfect in every way. Oddly, they remind me of Jude Law and Elina Lowensohn in The Wisdom of Crocodiles, though the roles are reversed (and yes, I do mean to imply there's tension of a romantic nature between them), and despite my love of The Wisdom of Crocodiles, Leandersson and Hedebrant are simply flat-out better in this film.<br /><br />Then there is Tomas Alfredson. Unlike his stars, this is not, by any means, Alfredson's first movie. Before getting showered with awards from around the world for this flick, Alfredson had already won both TV and movie awards, most notably for his 2004 film Four Shades of Brown. This is the kind of guy who would likely, were he in the American system, never even consider making a horror movie. But then, I'm not sure there's anyone like Alfredson in the American system. Who's the last director you can think of in Hollywood who made a TV comedy series, a movie spinoff, gritty dramas, and a horror film staring a couple of preteens? That sort of thing doesn't happen in America. And we are the worse for it. (And when was the last time you saw Kieslowski echoed in a horror film? Look at the building in which they live--if the two movies had been made in the same country, I'd swear it's the exact same apartment block that sits off to the side of the block where all the main characters live in Dekalog. And it's not just the building--it's the lighting as well.)<br /><br />I've already mentioned John Ajvide Lindqvist's script, but I should do so again, because it doesn't matter how good your actors are, you have to give them something to work from. And this script? Genius. It's everything that, I think, Twilight wanted to be and failed, both book and movie, so miserably to be. Everywhere that Twilight is ham-fisted, Let the Right One In is understated. As a result, the relationship between these two characters feels far more real than that between Bella and Edward, for whom the world essentially stops in order for the two of them to emote. The big difference, naturally, is that Twilight is essentially a romance, and is written in the way Americans expect a romance to be written. Let the Right One In, on the other hand, is a drama that contains romantic elements. The love story is less important than the characters who are involved in that love story; Lindqvist's characters are gloriously three-dimensional. Lindqvist took a lot of care to bring his characters to life, and it paid off in spades. Eli and Oskar are two of the most endearing characters in modern film, to the point that when we see Eli doing the things she needs to do to survive, there's no real horror involved; we can sympathize with the vampire during the vampire's least human moments. (There's one scene in particular towards the end of the film where this is particularly powerful, but it would be the mother of all spoilers to tell you what it is. You'll know it when you see it, and like the scene I mentioned before, it's one of the film's best. The sympathy that Lindqvist has taken the time to build is, one hundred percent, the reason this scene works as well as it does.)<br /><br />I could keep going. Once I'd made the Kieslowski connection in my head, I almost dug out my Dekalog review as used it as a template for this one. (This was the result of frustration; I've been trying to write this review for two months, and every time I've tried, it kept turning to mush. What finally made it gel was the other connection, to The Wisdom of Crocodiles. I can't believe it took me two months to see that.) It's one of the handful--at best--of movies I've seen since Dekalog that has had an effect anywhere near as profound. And the list of movies that would qualify contains a number of immortals (most notably Satantango). It's obviously far too early to consider calling Let the Right One In one of the best movies ever made. That hasn't stopped the machine that ranks the IMDB Top 250, where this movie sits at #190 as I write this. Time will tell if it becomes the classic it currently promises to be, but on a more local scale, I can remember few ten-best-of-2008 lists where Let the Right One In did not appear. The reason for this is evident; it is, in every way, a superlative achievement.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|As one of the earliest examples of cinematic science fiction and fantasy, \\"Destiny\\" director Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis\\" ranks as an unparalleled achievement in its size, scope, and vision. Forty years would elapse before Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (1968) would rival Lang's epic spectacle about a troubled, dystopian society fractured along the fault lines of the economic inequality that isolated the haves and the have-nots. Nevertheless, nothing could ever be said to surpass \\"Metropolis\\" as a film of scale, special effects, and surrealism. According to Frank Miller at the Turner Classic Movies Website in his Overview Article about \\"Metropolis, \\"Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou were influenced by several writers: \\"They drew ideas from a variety of sources, including Karel Capek's play about a robot revolt, R.U.R.; the pioneering Soviet science fiction film Aelita (1924); and H.G. Wells' novels.\\" Miller describes \\"Metropolis\\" as \\"the most influential science fiction film of all time.\\" Nevertheless, moviegoers should keep in mind that \\"Metropolis\\" was not the first science fiction film. George Melies short film \\"A Trip to the Moon\\" aka \\"Le voyage dans la lune\\" (1903) and the Soviet film \\"Aelita\\" (1924) preceded \\"Metropolis.\\"<br /><br />\\"Metropolis\\" inspired generations of filmmakers with its use of state-of-the-art visual effects that transformed the science fiction film.  Thea Von Harbou's saga about an evil robot  designed by a vengeful inventor to impersonate a flesh & blood female Christ figure and incite anarchy can clearly be traced as a source of inspiration to many contemporary sci-fi films and television shows, such as the \\"Terminator\\" franchise, \\"Robocop\\" franchise, \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Logan's Run,\\" \\"The Fifth Element,\\" and Battlestar Galactica.\\"  The \\"Metropolis\\" robot was not the first robot, but it was unmistakably the seminal one that sired a long line of cinematic robots.  The famous transformation scene where the robot turns into a human foreshadows the \\"Frankenstein\\" franchise.<br />Many detractors of Lang's visionary work--primarily noted sci-fi author H.G. Wells--derided it as shallow and his criticisms are not without substance.  Indeed, the characters lack depth because they represent archetypes instead of individuals in a larger-than-life story.  The spectacle, this Marxist chronicle of humanity at odds with itself over machinery, and the anarchy that emerges from this division makes \\"Metropolis\\" a memorable meditation about our flawed society, part sci-fi, part horror and a statement about the incompatibility polarity that comes about between those who control and those who are controlled.  Again, von Harbou's theme re-echoes with greater intensity.  The virtuous Maria would say that the head and the hands would need a mediator and the mediator would be the heart.  You cannot understand and appreciate science fiction as a cinematic genre until you see that every sci-fi film owes a debt of gratitude to Lang's masterly work of genius.  Actually, while Lang would make many greatmovies in a long career, the legendary Austrian director never made another sci-fi film that surpassed this milestone.<br /><br />A malevolent robot, messianic crusaders, a patriarchal titan of industry, a mad scientist with vengeance in his heart, and masses of mindless men and women enslaved by the patriarch constitute the array of characters in this famous work of German Expressionist cinema, and embraces Art-Deco in its architectural designs.  Scenarist Thea von Harbou and Fritz Lang assembled these protagonists and antagonists for the clash of the century with visuals that were designed to  overwhelm 1920's audiences by their sheer beauty and grandeur.  In the annals of science fiction film, these special effects, involving the use of mirrors to supplement shots of live action, matte paintings for sprawling cityscapes, and miniatures of the city, were singular.  All the planes, trains, and automobiles in the long shots weredone either with wires pulling them along or stop-action photography.  Reportedly, Lang got the idea for his cityscape from a trip to Manhattan, but there are too many undocumented stories about Lang and his inspiration; so you'd have to read the biographies available about his life to sort out the fiction from the fact.  One thing is certain Lang was more a film dictator than a director and he toiled endlessly and made his cast and collaborators toil to forge his vision.  Lang drove his actors, actresses, and technical crew like a slave driver and often exhibited a sense of perfectionism that defied civility and common sense.  He amounted to a cinematic Herod.<br /><br />While \\"Metropolis\\" qualifies as sci-fi, the film also dabbles in the disaster film.  The villainous father of the hero, Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), enlists the evil inventor, C.A. Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), to create a robot look-alike of the virginal heroine, Marie, who preaches a gospel of sorts to unit the workers.  Rotwang dresses in dark colors, has wind-blown hair, and wears a black glove on his right hand.  Fredersen wants Rotwang to forge a robot that can assume the identity of Marie (Brigitte Helm), mislead the masses, and get them to destroy themselves.  Joh has obtained secret plans for meetings among the workers and wants to thwart them.  Rotwang escorts Joh down into the 2000 year old catacombs to witness Marie preaching her gospel of unification and that is where Joh sees his son Freder (Gustav Fr&ouml;hlich) appear and embrace Marie.<br /><br />Previously, Freder was smitten with Marie when he saw her first early in the film.  She entered the Club of Sons where Freder cavorted with various women.  Freder was so stricken by Marie that he descended to the depths where the workers operated the machines and witnessed a meltdown.  Joh is worried about his son's dalliance with the workers because it threatens to destroy everything that he has worked for for so many years.  In fact, Joh fires his secretary Josaphat (Theodor Loos) because Josaphat didn't inform him about the incident with the machines.  Joh replaces Josaphat with the Thin Man (Franz Rasp) and orders him to keep him constantly abreast of his son's whereabouts.  Eventually, the false Marie does mislead the workers into destroying the Heart Machine and the loss of power leads to a flood that wipes out their homes.  Grot, the foreman in charge of the machines, warns Joh, but he orders Grot to open the gates so that the workers can destroy the Heart Machine.  The evil Marie leads the men and women workers alike to the machine hall, but she slips out a back exit while they destroy the machines.  What the workers fail to realize is that the destruction of the Heart machine will destroy their own homes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Freder and the real Marie rescue the children below as the flood waters rise from an underground river that Joh had constructed.  They use the air shafts to escape from the depth and take the children to the Club of the Sons above the earth.  At the same time, Grot alerts the workers about the dangers of what they have done and how it will jeopardize their children.  The furious workers now want to kill Marie.  The evil Marie has gone to a nightclub where she is celebrating her masquerade over the workers.  The nightclub revelers leave the club with Marie on their shoulders and go out into the night air.  The virtuous Marie has gotten separated from Freder and the children and is now being pursued by the mob of angry workers.  She runs into the revelers and wicked Marie and the mob grabs the evil Marie.  They tie her to a stake and set fire to her.  Rotwang captures the real Marie and takes her to the top of the cathedral.  Freder spots Rotwang with Marie over his shoulder and sets off in rapid pursuit.  They fight on the roof-top and Rotwang plunges to his death below.  In the last scene, the virtuous Marie calls on Freder to serve as the mediator between his fatherand Grot, the worker's representative, to work together.<br /><br />\\"Metropolis\\" dealth with one of Lang's recurrent themes--mob violence.

6305511055|4.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***    I really enjoy watching this film. It has first-rate suspense and is definitely entertaining. I have seen it multiple times and will continue to watch it.    Having said that, I have to admit I laugh when I read critics (elsewhere) writing about how \\"intelligent\\" this movie is. Intelligent? Yeah, right.    Let's see. A man goes out to lunch and comes back to discover (after walking into an open front door that previously shuts and locks automatically) that all his co-workers have been murdered. Shortly afterward, he is shot at by a professional killer, who, conveniently, misses! OK. Now on the run, our hero (Robert Redford) kidnaps a woman at random in broad daylight and forces her at gunpoint back to her apartment. (Nobody sees any of this.) About two hours later, the woman is making love to the man and is instantly in love with him!!    It gets better. The man - a professional reader, a bookworm, instantly turns into James Bond and the woman is instantly transformed from a lonely, shrinking violet into an international spy, boldly breaking into the CIA and talking tough to an agent. Wow, yes, that sure sounds plausible to me!     Well, I''ll repeat one thing, for the readers here who forgot my opening paragraph and think I am panning the film. I am not. I like the movie. it's entertaining. It's fun to watch, and that's the name of the game. It's nice to see it's out on Blu-Ray.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|This tiny little amp will change how you hear and think about music and all for under $30. It is so small; it literally mimics the size and shape of the iPod shuffles including the clip. By adding about 20% more power to your mp3 / computer / portable music playing apparatus, the music lights up as if it was the first time.  Features include a rechargeable internal battery, a high gain / high bass switch and its minuscule size. Distortion products are small as well. Personally this was perfect for me. A tiny amp that adds just enough so that the music can benefit and is less than 3 oz. If you've never used an amp this is perfect to start with. Combine it with even a middle-of-the-line headphone (less than $80) and you'll never look at music the same again. Highly recommended.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that it doesn't have an auto shut-off which became bothersome for me. Because of this you could easily leave it on all night spending the battery quickly; along with that, there is no battery meter leaving it up to the imagination as to how long you have left. I estimate a recharge lasts about 12-15 hours. What worries me is actual time before the battery goes permanently dead because it's internal and doubtful that it will be something you can pick up at your local retail store.
B000FMBCUK|5.0|Ok. This album is amazing. Never Going Back Again is brilliant and so is Second Hand News. There is not ONE bad song on this album. I don't know if it's my favorite FM album, but it definately owns up to today. Not many artists capture any feeling in their music like Fleetwood Mac did on this album. BUY IT! :)
0670020745|2.0|I was hoping for a first-hand account of stroke told through the (somewhat) objective lens of a scientist.  However, the book is written from the perspective of someone who buys into a lot of unsubstantiated and unproven ideas about how the brain works and pawns them off as empirical truths.  Unfortunately, the fact that the author has a Ph.D. (in the study of the anatomy of the brain, no less) will lend credibility to the new-agey claims she makes (especially in the latter half of the book).    The author also somewhat romanticizes and glamorizes stroke.  The vast majority of people who have a stroke don't have a caretaker with the financial resources to drop everything and take up their loved one's long-term care.  Most people go through traditional inpatient rehab and many also suffer from debilitating physical problems that they must deal with.  Many people struggle to resolve their pre- and post-stroke personalities, abilities, and identities without the aplomb Bolte-Taylor describes.  She glosses over the devastation left in the wake of a serious stroke by constantly referring to her ability to \\"connect with the oneness of the universe.\\"       Ultimately, the author makes too many illogical claims, professes credence in junk science, and contradicts herself too often to allow me to value any of her insights.  I am glad that Bolte-Taylor survived her ordeal, but I wish she had not written this book.
B001IF252M|5.0|This product works just as advertised, maybe even better. I have hooked this adapter up to my macbook and connected to countless displays and they have all worked perfectly, no wavy screens, no color mismatches and no bands. The only con if the VGA plug is a little loose, it wont output video so you have to connect and make sure you tighten at least one of the screws on the plug. The best part is that it outputs upto 1920X1080 resolution instead of apples adapter being limited to 1600X1200.

A well listened to cd in my collection!Also played in music rooms on the net all over the world. This is a highly recommended cd for all to collect. Enjoy !
159102594X|4.0|Just finished this book and jumped right into book number 2. I picked up this series based on the reviews that are posted here and I can say that I actually really like the story. The story mostly builds up for what is to come in the next two books, but there is still lots of action, overall has good writing, the characters are mostly well defined and not your standard cookie-cutter barbarian, warrior, wizard, etc. The character Glotka is definitely a someone that I haven't seen in all the many fantasy books I've read. I recommend this one.
B001GCUO16|4.0|X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a good prequel with Hugh Jackman, once again, starring in his most famous role as Wolverine. The focus is on the origin and essence of the young man who becomes the most famous Marvel Universe mutant. In the same vein as the recent comics storylines, this movie adaptation reveals that despite his somewhat youthful appearance, Wolverine is among the oldest of the mutants. His physical prowess, as well as his abilities to physically heal immediately after being injured, make him virtually ageless in the sense ascribed to the Vampires and Lycans in Underworld.    Though not perfect, X-Men Origins: Wolverine has no quickly apparent plot holes. The attention was placed upon the title character, as one would rightfully expect. A \\"sibling rivalry\\" against Sabretooth provided an interesting twist that laid the foundation for both character and story development. And it is the escalating animosity between the two that plays to the movie's strengths.    Fascinating special effects are added as Wolverine's physiology undergoes drastic transformations. With his natural healing abilities put to the ultimate test, Wolverine is having to endure levels of extreme pain, as his skeleton is infused with the indestructible metal that comes to be known as adamantium.    Wolverine, by undergoing this experiment, is identified as the outcome of the Weapon X project, which, as a central theme in itself, adds nice science fiction components. Involved in the program are the capture of mutants of exceptional ability and then taking samples of their traits and later amalgamating them to create a type of indomitable super soldier. One might not help but think of Frankenstein or Re-Animator but with a higher level of genetic engineering involved.    Ironically, it is when the the most stunning visuals are displayed that the story momentarily loses traction. As the movie delves further into the Weapon X project, the viewer finds out that it is part of a grand scheme designed to wage war on mutants. This overture, I think, could and should have been avoided. Though there are brief glimpses of the early pasts of Wolverine and Sabretooth, as they survive the Civil War, WWI, WWII, and the Vietnam War, the history of how humans came to fear mutantkind is not intertwined. Thus the mutants are our enemies theme does not serve an insightful, pivotal element.    However, despite the deficient forthcomings that have emanated, things are properly adjusted, and X-Men Origins: Wolverine turns out to be a success as opposed to a disappointment that fizzles to the end. The movie gets back to its strong points, where we are entreated to a Wolverine and Sabretooth showdown, as well as romantic involvements concerning Wolverine that were never introduced in the previous X-Men releases.     Overall, a thumb up for this near masterpiece. Hugh Jackman, as anticipated, shows his acting talents and, once again, recreates one of the most fascinating and popular Marvel characters around. His Wolverine, from a theatrical perspective, triumphs as the lovable, perfect character who, though not idealistic, has far too much courage to be branded an antihero.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|BEFORE<br /><br />I thought this movie was great! Slightly wierd perhaps, but a really good ride and very interesting.<br /><br />THEN<br /><br />I saw Firefly.<br /><br />And NOW<br /><br />the movie isn't as good to me<br />it doesn't entirely make sense<br />there is still so much missing that we never learn about. :(<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />Since I watched the movie first when I didn't know it was related, I can still enjoy it somewhat, I just try (very hard) to distance it from the series in my mind. That way they are relatively unrelated and the movie didn't sck.<br /><br />(The movie didn't actually sck, but the series shouldn't have ended and there is still SO much missing that we never get to find out about, it's very disapointing, enough to cause a wee bit of movie dislike.)
B0009AM5I6|5.0|I love opera, but I bought this DVD because of Gheorghiu's debut playing Violetta, and of course, Solti conducting this wonderful Traviata. I own several DVDs with this opera, but she is the best Violetta ever on my DVD collection. Her voice is so beautiful, rich and soft, velvety when needed that you can feel Violetta's love, and power of sacrifice. Huge talent. I also loved her acting. I can't say the same things about the whole Traviata. Lopardo didn't seen to match with Angela. I did not enjoy his acting. Unfortunately, when Alfredo is not the right acting/singing tenor, the whole performance is damaged. Leo Nucci as his father, Giorgio Germont, is a wonderful baritone, with a good acting and overall he almost outshines his son.<br />My best Traviata would be with 1994 Angela's Violetta from Covent Garden and the rest of the cast would come from Zeffirelli/Domingo Traviata in the small Giuseppe Verdi theater in Buseto, Italy. But that's just a dream...<br />I recommend this DVD to all opera lovers looking for a wonderful almost historic Violetta.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is amazing awsome.<br /><br />It is horribly horribly sad that (stupid) fox got it cancelled after only one season.

0226264211|5.0|Whether you are a liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, this is a fundamental popular \\"textbook\\" of required reading, if you care about your family and this (or any) country.     It's timeless: the book sounds like it was written this year, even though it was written in the early 1960s.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|I don't understand the the fuss over trival details with the extras and comparisons to other movie mastering.<br /><br />The reality is that this is a great edition of a great movie. The BD version is terrific - best yet, and I've seen Patton since the theater when it was first released. The improvement over the previous DVD release is amazing, I felt like I was in the theater again.<br /><br />The Ghost Corps is  a worthwhile addition whether you agree with it or disagree. Form your own opinion - remember, the movie Patton is considered a war movie, an anti-war movie and a select biography of an undeniably important hero of WW II.<br /><br />Waiting for \\"the next version\\" is silly, get it now.<br /><br />The movie stands alone and Blu-Ray does it justice.
0375826726|4.0|All in all after reading the first two books in this series, Paolini delivers a thrilling, well-paced read again.  While some of the plot twists and turns are predictable, Paolini still hits you with a few unexpected ones.  I enjoyed the time spent on further developing the different characters in this one.  You feel yourself growing along with them as they develop, almost like you are flipping through each one's family photo album.  I'm looking forward to the fourth book and seeing how Paolini finishes this very entertaining series!

B001DHXT20|4.0|The great special effects make this a fun movie to watch for the whole family. If you like The Incredible Hulk comics then you'll love this movie. But even if you've never heard of The Hulk this action packed flick will take you for an entertaining ride.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Being a person who is afraid of heights, it's a wonder why I went and saw this movie. I know, I know...it's an animation. But we are talking about Pixar here. These are the same people who challenge reality with their 3 Dimensional pixel interpretations of it. So, yeah, the continuous shots way UP there had me a little phobic.    It's a little embarrassing really. There I am - a grown man - trying to maintain composure, while surrounded by a bunch of laughing children who no better than I do that it's only a movie.    It's only a movie. It's only a movie.    Luckily there was plenty of comedy to relax me between my phobic fits. From the trailer you'd think the funniest character in here is the dog with the talking collar. Oh, he's funny alright. But what got me are the old fogies who go at it. Who knows if Pixar will get an Academy Award for this one. But there should be some kind of trophy for being the first company to animate two cranky geezers putting the smack down on each other.    One of these cranks is Carl Fredricksen, who goes on a last second honeymoon balloon ride to Paradise Island. His co-pilot is a boyscout who effectively overlooks or just plain ignores Carl's crusty exterior. They make it to Paradise Island alright. That's where they find \\"Dog\\" (that's his name), and this other old crank who has been there long before them. Two cranks as neighbors, even in Paradise, never works. So the fighting begins. And some of it happens way up in the sky, so my twitching and shifting in my seat began. But I loved it, anyway.    Old Man Carl reminds me of my cranky Uncle, whom I love almost as much as this movie.

1416550534|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I won't recap the plot since others here have. This is a very rich story of sisterhood, secrets, and hw a few relationships define a person's life. It also spans a century and tells the story through reflection, with Grace looking back upon her life so you get to see her world through different lenses; the clarity of the present and the perspective of the past.
1905654294|1.0|This book is so bad that there are actual websites devoted to how bad it is! I don't know why amazon.com decided to separate the reviews for the hardcover vs. the softcover book, they don't do this for any other book so it just seems weird to me but if you are a new reader and stumbled onto this page by mistake just look up the hardcover version you will see over 4500 reviews there, almost 1000 of which are 1-star.<br /><br />I have a review already on the hardcover page but I'll just say I was ESPECIALLY SAD for what she did with Jacob and Leah. It seems like SMeyer doesn't care about any of her characters except for Bella and Edward, all the other characters are there just for scenery's sake. I also felt very sorry for Charlie and Renesme, the supposedly \\"uniquest baby in the world\\" who will never have a childhood and already has her entire future planned out for her including her future husband.<br /><br />Smeyer, what did \\"Free will\\" ever do to you?? Really??

0060833459|5.0|I read this as an MBA student and it helped a lot throughout my formative years in the business world. Reading it now (12 years later) as the owner of my own business makes me appreciate this classic even more. It's a great book to have at your side to make the most of the most valuable resource: time. As in Drucker's on Innovations and Entrepreneurship, its fundamental lessons are solid foundations to build a career/business on. Read it, learn it, live it and you will get more out of life.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I love this game.  Some friends introduced it to my husband and I and we loved it so much, we had to buy our own.  Every since then, we have brought the game to every party we go to and have introduced it to the students in my 7th grade classroom.  Everyone who has tried it loves it.  It's always slow in the beginning when you are first learning how the games work, but every game after wards gets more and more exciting.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|First off, I wish people would not rate this movie, just based on the subtitle mess-up. The review box should be more about the whole content of the movie, and not reflect just one flaw. That being said, I do understand the frustration with the subtitles, as I have a copy with-out the theatrical subtitles. Thus I was forced to watch the movie in English (dubbed). I do plan on getting the version with the theatrical subtitles, but I still think this movie was awesome.    The story:  I have to admit it was slow in parts, but that does add to the overall feeling of the movie. It struck me as a cold (no pun intended), dark movie. The plot was not as slow, as within a short time the movie took it's first dark turn with the first murder. As the story progressed the relationship between Eli and Oscar became more fascinating for me. It seemed like Eli was Oscar's strength and yet Oscar was Eli's emotion. Yet the relationship between the two was almost sinister, urging each other to do things the other would not have done with out the other. This is manifest for Oscar in the scene were Oscar fights back in the park, and for Eli it is in the scene at the pool.    The production/music, ect. -  The production was good. It really set the mood of the movie, as did the music.    Overall-  Great movie. I really can't say it any other way. Watch it and decide for yourself.
0307155102|5.0|I have bought this book over and over again as a gift for everyone I know that is having a baby. My own kids absolutely loved it. It is wonderful for having converstions with little ones about the pictures and building vocabulary. No child should miss out on it!
B001RTP48G|4.0|The remixes are very nice. I like the '80's feel to the remixes. It is definitely worth purchasing.
0316017922|4.0|I had previously read \\"Blink\\", which I thought was just repetitive droning about an intuitive topic (which was that experience allows one to make gut decisions). I was prepared for more of the same, but to my surprise, the author does provide insight into topics which I had not heard of or understood well. As usual, the author writes in a clear and engaging style.    Some of the reviewers of this book overly criticize it for being insufficiently deep. Such criticism is misdirected: this book is intended for a general audience, not for scientists.    The author discusses several topics in this book, including:    (1) how the month of birth for Canadien hockey players affects their career (being born immediately after the cutoff date for team eligibility allows such kids to have an extra year of practice and physical growth);    (2) the importance of attaining mastery of a topic after reaching the magic mark of 10,000 hours of practice in one's chosen field (the author provides stories of how Bill Joy and Bill Gates were able to get programming practice on time-sharing machines -- as opposed to batch processing systems -- in 1971 and 1968, respectively, as well as anecdotes on chess players and musicians, including the Beatles);    (3) in chapters 3 and 4, he discusses the difference between what I would call \\"book smarts\\" and \\"street smarts\\": the author talks of how Robert Oppenheimer had incredible book smarts but used street smarts (aka social skills) to get the position he wanted;    (4) the importance of \\"being in the right place at the right time\\" in chapter 5 is discussed. Being born in the right year allows one to have great opportunities (e.g. being in college in the early 1930s when enrollment was low allowed you to get a great education, and being in a particular industry just as it's booming leads to riches).    In the latter half of the book, he talks about how one's ethnic and cultural backgrounds affects decisions and personal opportunities:    (5) In cases where airliners were crashing, much of the problem evidently stemmed from cases where the first officer was not sufficiently proactive in raising safety issues because they were from a culture where submission to the pilot and other authorities (like the air traffic control) was the norm.    (6) In some countries in Asia where rice is grown, the discipline instilled from rice growing (\\"waking up before dawn 360 days a year\\") provides a positive boost in kids' learning. He notes that kids who scored higher on difficult tests were the same ones who spent the most time working on these tests before giving up. The author also mentions an interesting idea that the reason the Chinese do better in math is because their language for numbers is shorter (allowing them to absorb more numbers in two seconds -- the limit of short-term memory -- than English speakers) and because their counting system is better (for example, the English word for 14 is fourteen, but the word for 12 is twelve, which is weird and, as the author asserts, may be the reason why four-year-old Chinese kids can count up to 40 but 4-year-old English-speaking kids can count up to only 15).    (7) In chapter 9 the author explores the impact of the summer vacation. Kids from better-off families can spend time reading and learning, whereas kids from poorer families do not do so and receive much less support from their parents. This assertion is backed by a study that show how both classes of kids learn the same from September to Spring, but their retained knowledge the following Fall differs significantly.    Overall this book was very well written in an easy, fluid style. The only negative is that, indeed as critics say, it is not deep; for instance, the assertion from chapter 9 is backed by only one study. However, that is not a terrible fault worthy of a 1-star review; as I mentioned at the onset, the book is written for a general audience, and the book serves its purpose well in engaging the reader.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|\\"Fans are clinging, complaining dip***** who will never ever be grateful for any concession you make.  The moment you shut out their shrilled tremulous voices the happier you'll be for it.\\"  -A saying from Yahtzee the video game reviewer (who I think actually hated this movie too)    This is true for the unfortunate who actually think that this movie is so terrible that it should have never been made.  These same fans were the ones who hated the prequel star wars trilogy.    I'll admit that when I first saw this movie in theaters I had the same feeling of dissatisfaction that I felt when I watched the star wars prequels, which I thought had horrible acting.  However I never hated any of these movies but was grateful that the same people who made the originals were willing to put out the hard work to make more of what I liked.    Although, I recently watched the entire star wars saga with my girlfriend (who hasn't seen any of them) and found that I enjoyed watching the prequel trilogy a lot more than I did the first time around.  When watching these films together for the first time, I was extremely shocked to find that the original trilogy had just as horrible acting as the prequel trilogy did, which is something I couldn't notice as a kid.  My girlfriend actually liked the prequel trilogy the most (which still drives me crazy).    When I watched Indy 4 for the second time along with the first three in the series, it was a similar feeling.  I realized that Indy 4 is just as ridiculous, unrealistic, and fun as the first 3 in the series.  It really isn't that much different.  The story is the same, in that Indy tries to find an ancient artifact before its power falls in the hands of evil-doers.  The only disappointment is that it seems as though Lucas has been adding more and more cartoony elements in his films over time.  While they existed in his previous films (R2D2, C3P0) its gotten worse (Jar Jar Binks, the stupid prairie dog in the beginning of this movie, and the dumb vine swinging scene).  This film has a lot of those elements but it doesn't ruin the movie.  The best part about this movie is how good Harrison Ford still is and I was surprised to see that.    Yeah yeah they probably could have made this film better but whoopty-freakin-do.  Just take it for what it is and enjoy it.  When I watched it the second time, I realized that it I changed more than the indy or star wars films have.  I think that its the same for everyone.  If you hate this film as much as the people who rate it one star then that just means that you are missing out on the fun and its your loss.  I would give this four stars, but I'm giving it five to try and cancel out the ridiculously low ratings that this film doesn't deserve.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|'Martyrs' is one of those movies that slips along once in a while. You catch word of it, believe the hype about how extreme/ how shocking, it is - how it's going to make you re-evaluate horror movies forever - and you get a rush from it. The moment the film starts the rules are out and anything goes...  'Cannibal Holocaust' was maybe the last movie i saw to elicit such a response, probably because it was all i dreaded it to be and more. But most of the time the hype doesn't catch and you feel let down, not with this movie.   Playing from every sub-genre of horror from the torture gore of 'Saw' and 'Hostel', to the clinical realism of Michael Haneke and David Cronenberg to the illogical stylism of Dario Argento - film makers not only know how to work with the genre but effortlessly play with the rules - not for the sake of it but, much like Orson Welles with 'Citizen Kane',because they CAN!   From beginning to end you have no idea what might happen next. OK so maybe a few things remind you of movies past, but seriously, the ultimate message is way behind normal horror fare and, in another sense, it's hard to find a movie so gut-wrenchingly twisted that has a point. anybody who would give this an average/ below-average review is not a horror film lover and is therefore biased. they cannot appreciate a movie within the context of it's genre and therefore have no right to an opinion.
0312427999|5.0|Naomi Klein explains the shock doctrine as the political stratigy that exploits crisis and desperation of the masses to create a magical way out of a crisis and enact policies that would never be approved in \\"normal times\\".  The shock doctrine frequently applies to a situation where developing countries need foreign aid, because they're facing a disaster, and that presents an opportunity to promote extremely unpopular pro-corporate policies. As a result of governments' deception, the majority of people will suffer declining incomes and increased unemployment, while few parties benefit disproportionately from the situation<br /><br />Klein discusses the similarities between the political/economic shock doctrine and psychiatric shock therapy in terms of torture and failure to improve the state before and after the shock.. She gives numerous examples over the last 30 years of history, where the shock doctrine was applied: The seventies where the shock doctrine was used to transform South American economies, the Falklands during Margaret Thatcher's times, and natural/economic disasters where the shock doctrine was used in Poland, Russia, Asia and Africa.<br /><br />Brilliantly, Klein elucidates  the \\"disaster capitalism complex\\" where companies profit from these disasters and shows how the invasion of Iraq was a full scale use of the 9/11 shock. The evidence that most people choose to ignore is detailed in this book; the result of pushing the Iraqi parliament to accept a US-backed oil law gave oil companies the ability to manage 75%of the oil fields and leaving only 25% for Iraqis. As Klien puts it in one of her recent interviews; what happened in Iraq is a \\"daylight robbery\\".<br /><br />During these difficult economic times, This is one book that everyone should read. Hard working American citizens wonder why our economy is falling apart after the war and this book helps explain why. It is sadder yet when good Americans who are loyal to their government refuse to understand that Iraq's oil fields were one of the reasons behind the war. These good hearted people defend their government saying: if the oil was the reason, how come the oil prices are high and why is our economy suffering now that the American troops are in Iraq? This book helps answer these questions. Neither the American citizens nor the American soldiers' families ( and for sure not the Iraqi people) are benefiting from the war, but other some major corporations and daylight thieves are.<br /><br />In these hard times, when companies are still using economic shock to sell us more fake solutions; Viagra's commercials, for instance,  tell us that during these hard times of foreclosures and unemployment, a man should be hard too. Sadly, it's a very funny commerical, and there are numerous other examples of products being pushed in the market to distract and numb the shocked masses .  The escape from this economic disaster can not be found in magic products or new distractions. Open your eyes!  Read this book and you will understand the reasons behind this situation.  Highly recommended.l fields were one of the reasons behind the war.

0205632645|5.0|I purchased three copies of this book as graduation gifts as our relatives begin their college careers and one copy for our son who is a fine writer and finds the guide very useful.
0385340575|5.0|I am giving 5 stars for this book because it is as good as it gets for the character as he has evolved.  The earlier novels that explored Jack's past and how he came to be who he is were better books.  But Child is through with developing the character, it seems.  So I have decided to evaluate him on the basis of the action/intrigue formula.  And Child has returned to top form with this entry.       I won't go on and on regarding the plot.  There are many good synopsis reviews here.  But this was a great read.  It was intriguing, exciting, and satisfying.  The villains were very very bad, frighteningly plausible, and yet unique. In response, Reacher rained down enough righteous fury to satisfy the most depressed international news junkie. Lee Child is to be congratulated on creating a book superior to several previous efforts, rather than continuing on an inspiration-drained slide, as has been the fate of other series that started well.  The author is still not thrilled with the excesses possible under the Patriot Act, but he does not spare us any details of just how dangerous our enemies are either. Hey, we get all our great plots and action from the guy, Don't begrudge Mr. Child a bit of a bully pulpit - as long as it doesn't become a political diatribe like Born to Lose. He obviously listens to his fans; and that is a smart man.     Back to his protagonist and our hero, Reacher is a bit superhuman, but we like him that way.  Jack has to be 47 at the time of the action in 2008, since he states that he was still at West Point in 1983 (22 maximum plus 25).  He gets a lot of \\"senior\\" comments from active law enforcement types, but holds up just fine, thank you. However, it was cool to have him being taken a bit down to size (figuratively speaking) by Delta Force veteran Springfield's comments regarding the denouement, despite his obvious prowess.  And as for what one reviewer has referred to as the gratuitous roll in the hay, would he be Reacher without reminding youthat he is a sexual, if not romantic, guy? I was waiting for it and could actually have used a few more details, thank you. As a female reader, I like my action heroes sexy as well as lethal. For sexless I could just turn to the Terminator. And speaking in that vein, Child makes Reacher larger than life without becoming a cartoon. I kind of dreaded the new Reacher novel after being mired in Despair the last time.  But Hope prevailed. Ok that's corney, but pretty hard to resist. At any rate, I can't wait for Number 14.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|I'm a big fan of Westerns and I had already read the book, so this was a no-brainer for me. I was further intrigued when I read that Ed Harris had fallen in love with the book while on vacation and had immediately purchased the rights. In my estimation, Ed Harris is one of the most underrated actors out there and I had high hopes for the movie when I learned of his involvement. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />The story is familiar to most fans of the genre. Rancher Randall Bragg, played with cold charm by Jeremy Irons, believes he and his men are above the law. They take food and supplies from the town of Appaloosa and create a general atmosphere of terror. Enter Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch, travelling lawmen hired by the town to deal with Bragg and his henchman who have disposed of the town's previous sheriff. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are excellent in the roles of Cole and Hitch, capturing perfectly the complex friendship and loyalty between the two men. They institute a new set of laws and proceed to enforce them, much to the chagrin of Bragg, his men, and the town fathers alike.<br /><br />Complicating matters is the arrival of a piano playing widow, Alison French, played by Renee Zellweger. She takes a fancy to Cole and the feeling is mutual. Alison has issues of her own, however, chiefly the need to be with whatever man she perceives to be the alpha male. This leads to problems later in the film.<br /><br />The film deftly moves between Cole and Hitch's efforts to bring Bragg to justice and Cole's burgeoning relationship with Ally. The two plots come together in an unexpected fashion and lead directly to the resolution of the film.<br /><br />The movie is dialog driven and moves slow in places, but it never seems ponderous. The relationship between Cole and Hitch drives the film. Their loyalty and deep bond for one another is something that Robert Parker has always been adept at creating and Harris wisely showcases these elements in his screenplay and direction. Harris's director's eye is impeccable, making use of classic western imagery. The attention to detail is impressive, as weapons, clothing, and setting appear authentic to the times. The violence in the movie comes in quick brutal spurts, very realistically portrayed.<br /><br />I enjoyed the hell out of this movie, just as I had the novel. The characters act and talk the way you wish you could in real life. The casting was great and even Renee Zellweger held her own. (I was especially pleased to find that Lance Henriksen was cast as a hired gun employed by Bragg.) Ed Harris does a remarkable job as Cole, a cold man with few social graces, struggling with his feelings for Ally, driven to defeat Bragg and enforce his law. When he's violent it is without remorse. Mortensen is equally as good as Hitch, a more emotional man, who sees the darkness in Cole, but doesn't have it himself. As I said before, their dynamic makes the film work. This is a western in the tradition of [[ASIN:B00006FDCJ Unforgiven (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00005RHGL Tombstone - The Director's Cut (Vista Series)]], maybe not quite as good as those two films, but it's damn close. Even though I knew what was coming, it was still stirring to see the action played out on the screen. The movie's ending is elegant, holding true to the code that the two main characters have forged.ye is impeccable, making use of classic western imagery.

B0015OKWL2|1.0|For me, this failing attempt to bring together to the screen two acting legends, Academy Award winners Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, is reminiscent of the equally disastrous project from few years ago, The Monster in Law for which another legend, Jane Fonda came our of the retirement. While watching her so called comedy, I kept thinking, is THAT what she picked up for her come back? While watching Righteous Kill with De Niro and Pacino, for almost every of its very long 103 minutes I thought, you guys better enjoy retirement than choose the project like this.<br /><br />Why are the ending results of both attempts so disappointing? Why do we have the comedy that is not funny and the thriller that does not thrill. Watching Richteous Kill, You would think that the union of two brilliant actors would save a weak, mediocre, simply not interesting in all departments picture but it did not happen. Instead of following rather predictable plot, I kept looking at the actors who have given us so many moments of joy and thinking to myself, no, it is not Serpico, nor ...And Justice for All, no Taxi Driver, nor Heat, nor The Sea of Love. What was it? What about the twists that I figured after ten minutes into the movie? What was about the ending that easily could win an award for the most ridiculous, preposterous, and stupidest scene that involves two Oscar winners ever. I love Crime /Thriller/Mystery mixed with the drama. Those are among my favorites and I am not too picky. As long as the movie is clever, well acted, keeps me guessing and entertains me, I am happy. It is not the case with Righteous Kill, and even two stars can't save it. Ironically, the most memorable scene for me was De Niro (Turk) quoting Dirty Harry, \\"There's nothing wrong with a little shooting, as long as the right people get shot.\\" It made me think about Clint Eastwood. How did he manage to direct himself last year in his own film at the age of 78, and to make it a fantastic poignant movie that obviously salutes to his most beloved character Dirty Harry Callahan, tells the story in the best traditions that seem lost nowadays, and ends on a high and moving note. The film with two great actors should be a cinematic event, not a laughing stock. I'd suggest De Niro and Pacino contact Eastwood and try to do a movie together or even crazier idea - to remake Righteous Kill with Woody Allen or Brothers Coen. I would be first in line to see any of these three hypothetical movies during the first weekend.o his most beloved character Dirty Harry Callahan, tells the story in the best traditions that seem lost nowadays, and ends on a high and moving note.

I was not prepared for what I would be learning... and I am sure there is a lot more to this than was written... to think that this is still going on in Africa and the world is watching, or more like turning their heads... the story of Ishmael is very well written and drew me into the life he had to live to survive... it was a great book and if you are looking for a read to learn about the trouble these children are living, I highly recommend it...

B001TOD9VI|4.0|The Wrestler was one of those movies that you heard everybody talk about. You heard Mickey Rourke was back in the performance of the life time playing a charcter that mirrored himself. Believe the hype because the movie is that good. It's a movie fueled by character performances and was a pleasantly suprising movie.    Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson was a star in the 80's. He was the equivalent of Hulk Hogan. He dominated the wrestler world. The 90's and new century haven't been so kind to poor Randy. He's found himself as a wash up and has been. Instead of filling Madison Square Gardens he's now having trouble packing a high school gym. It gets even worse after a hear attack finds himself wondering about what to do with his life. He longs for a relationship with Cassidy(Tomei) a stripper who doesn't date customers. He's trying to patch a relationship that he never had with his daughter Stephanie(Wood). In fact she can't stand and pretty much hates him. Randy is faced with a ton of problems. He should give up wrestling on the eve of the 25 reunion of his greatest match. Can he get a true relationship with either women in his life. That is the tale of the movie The Wrestler.    Rourke truly is amazing in the movie. He pulls the look off of a wrestler. He had to be looking at picutres and videos of Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, and any other wrestler trying to hold onto his 80's glory. Rourke plays the role to perfection. I found myself feeling bad for the guy as you see him trying to sruggle to hold onto his past glory. The things he does to try to stay in shape. You pity him that he has no friends and struggles for attention from anybody. There's a great scene where you find him playing NES with a kid in his trailer park. It truly is the performance of his carear.    The two women in Randy's life are exceptional as well. Marisa Tomei looks great in the movie. Evan Rachel Wood does also. You feel pity for both women whose lives are almost as bad as Randy. You want to see bothsucceed both Randy keeps blowing it with either of them, especially his daughter Stephanie. They give Oscar caliber performances and this movie should help both build on budding carears.    I've seen all of Darren Aronofsy's movies now except for The Fountain. The guy is pretty dang good as a director. I'd say this is his second best work behind Requiem for a Dream.\\" Like most critics I doubted his ability to do a wrestling movie. I would have doubted almost any director not named Scorsese, Coppola, or De Palma making the movie. The movie flows incredibly. The acting, editing, music, and everything else are great. I hope people keep bank rolling Aronofsky and he keeps churning out great movies.    I was pleasantly surprised by The Wrestler. Mickey Rourke is back and hopefully can keep his act together. It really is a decent movie. It's one of the best movies of 2008 and is a must see. Plus, you have to love the 80's nastalgia to it. It features the music of Ratt particulary the song Round and Round. Take a a nice round journey and don't miss The Wrestler.

It's just the \\"songs\\" from the play, which doesn't really tell the story.  Just wanted to prevent someone else from making the same mistake I made.

However, the narrative of the movie does not flow well. Sequencing is off, and some parts seem compressed. The ending does not leave the viewer wanting anything. I listened to the director's commentary, and he gave a decent reason. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen. If you're a fan, then you almost have to see it, but you shouldn't expect it to be as good as the books. The cast and the effects are awesome, but the storytelling would've been better had it been more straight from the book with better pacing.

B001GM28HO|3.0|Stefani Germanotta, a.k.a. Lady Gaga, has pulled all the right strings to stir mass attention and create quite a buzz at retail and radio. It just so happens that she has single-handedly given pop music a stinging shot in the arm. Late 2000s pop needed an intriguing figure like Gaga to come along - a rearview mirror on this decade in Top 40 land makes for a relatively unmemorable glance. Or at least it did until now.<br /><br />Her public persona may absolutely ooze pretense, but quite the opposite goes for Gaga's music itself - \\"The Fame\\" has a healthy serving of sticky, summery, track-repeat-button-beckoning pure pop confections. Save for Kylie Minogue and Britney Spears, no pop performer this decade has succeeded so well at delivering tunes that so squarely hit the musical sweet tooth - treats that are not guilty pleasures but simply pleasures. Gaga, however, outdoes her contemporaries in that she is the principal writer behind her material and creator of her style and persona, even if the music itself is not entirely original - nor need it be.<br /><br />The opening foursome of \\"Just Dance\\" featuring Colby O'Donis, \\"LoveGame\\", \\"Paparazzi\\" and \\"Poker Face\\" are all the stuff of pure pop bliss with melodies that not only thoroughly entrench themselves in the cranium but do not irritate from overexposure or wear out their welcome. They at once demonstrate Gaga's gift for scintillating melodies and sexy, club-friendly lyrics. Choosing RedOne and Rob Fusari as producers was a stroke of genius. These tracks serve as a reminder of an important truth that seems to be eluding not only the general public but the entertainment industry as well - at its best, pop songcraft is as valid a musical endeavor as any other.<br /><br />\\"Just Dance\\" and \\"Poker Face\\" have both been solid #1 hits, and \\"LoveGame\\" is headed in that direction, currently sitting at #22. With its slinky, sultry beats and yearning, tugging melody, \\"Paparazzi\\" is unlike Gaga's current hits in that it is not straightforwardly club-ready but instead benefits from a starker treatment, showing off her particular vocal versatility and grace. Its nearly twisted, dreamy take on unrequited love is wholly original.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the quality of the album takes a small but noticeable dip. Tracks like the muscular \\"I Like It Rough\\" and \\"Money Honey\\" are choppy and energetic but instantly forgettable, while the flighty \\"Summerboy,\\" which catches a ride on an awesome electric guitar, is quite fun yet falls substantially short of being in the league of the album's opening tracks, or, for that matter, substantially differentiating itself from much of the material that pads the middle of the album, \\"Boys Boys Boys\\" being a prime example. \\"Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\\" is also a sprightly little piece of pop that renders itself completely innocuous. Other tracks such as the breathy, downbeat \\"Brown Eyes\\" and the title track attempt to demonstrate Gaga's versatility but show her creative palette wearing a bit thin. Her eagerness to please the listener is never in question, but that these tracks are not worth repeated spins - especially when given such a strong bunch of radio hits at the beginning of the record - is neither.<br /><br />\\"The Fame\\" is not an out and out homerun, but it shows exciting potential for a rare new talent who is already deserving of the title 'pop star.' Gaga knows what people like and she demonstrates unrestrained determination to deliver it. Many young female entertainers draw comparisons to the entertainment powerhouse that is Madonna (Spears and Katy Perry chief examples), but in Gaga the public now has one who is truly worthy of such a comparison. It is a premature stage, of course, but if \\"The Fame\\" is any indication Gaga's engagement entertaining pop listeners will be long and fortuitous.ady but instead benefits from a starker treatment, showing off her particular vocal versatility and grace.

So much of the 1980s hits are best remembered as heard on the radio, or at best, in CD quality at the supermarket, etc.  So I can understand why they would put out a single layer SACD of Cyndi Lauper for die hard fans.  It's single layer because you already own the CD.  An SACD format is required to get those shrill notes, squeaks and screams.  Surprisingly, even some of the synth work benefits from super-sonic playback.  I find my ear drums quake from the keyboard at the start of \\"All Through the Night\\".
0375826726|1.0|It's not bad to be formulaic. High Fantasy usually follows a pretty predictable story arc and although predictable, the nuance the writer brings is what keeps me coming back.<br /><br />Eragon was formulaic, but a good start all the more intriguing for the author's youth. My hope was for some maturity in his writing as he matured. No such luck though. Unfortunately (for me) in Eldest, Eragon was blessed overnight (literally) with increased senses, super-strength, and elf-like ears. At that point I no longer connected with the character and the story went two-dimensional for me. He didn't have to work for those abilities so I lost the tenuous connection I had with him.<br /><br />This brings me to Brisingr. I didn't finish it, so perhaps this review is untimely. But I found I didn't care for the Eragon in this volume as I did in the first one, so I ended up not caring what happened to him.
B000GW8OAK|4.0|This movie has a strange appeal.<br />It not only brings out your atavistic side but it also shows a simple and very often touching comradery not only between the two main characters but also the entire group of the good \\"bad\\" guys.<br />The plot is simple and mindless but it is a great ride, particularly on a 57\\" HD TV.
B0007RO57U|2.0|I am disappointed with this recording. It is not at all exciting and contains intrusive coughing in several tracks.<br /><br />We had a wonderful recording of Gavrilov playing virtuoso 19th and 20th century repertoire, but this cd is not in that league.<br /><br />I recommend Murray Perahia's Handel and Scarlatti cd as a much better piano alternative.
0525457585|5.0|Great book for all ages.  One caveat though ...  If you love the movie then the book may confuse or even frustrate you. The movie ends at about the halfway point of the book. If you haven't seen the movie I recommend reading the book first.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I already have about 6 handheld GPS's, all which would have worked for me (but required more wires & space in my backpack) but I bought this one for convenience to go with my new Eee PC and Microsoft Streets.  As other reviewers reported, it is amazingly good at getting a signal.  When I first tried it, it actually got a signal INSIDE my hotel room (I am normally standing out in the parking lot with my GPS muttering 'acquire, acquire'.<br /><br />It is also very well built... solid feeling, etc.  Not cheaply made.  Worth a little extra, IMHO.<br /><br />It also works fine with all my marine navigation programs like Maxsea, The Capn, Nobeltec, etc.  Very nice backup unit in a very small package.
B000002JKS|4.0|If Pictures at Eleven was LedZep for the 80s, and The Principle of Moments was a nod toward the art-rock of Asia, NOBODY was prepared for this album, Plant's avant garde masterpiece. Jimmy Page fanatics must have been aghast at the keyboards and guitar synth splashed all over the sonic canvas. This album was SO weird I could not stop listening to it for the entire month of June 1985. While the MTV/dance floor/hi-tech influences are everywhere, the album bizarrely holds together even when it sounds like Plant is THISCLOSE to completely losing it. Only the single \\"Little by Little\\" sounds even remotely like anything that has come before, so far off the beaten path has everyone involved strayed. Drummer Ritchie Hayward almost steals the whole album, and guitarist Robbie Blunt was so unhappy with this brilliant mess he was fired after the tour. The drift away from LedZep's monumentalism is complete. I found this album much easier to absorb than 1989's Manic Nirvana. And pity the poor soul who tries to transcribe the lyrics: it must set some kind of record for the most usages of the words \\"girl\\" and \\"baby\\"!
B001PA0FFO|4.0|Saw this one under duress, since it looked kind of dumb in the trailer, and also the play had such a good performance in it by Cherry Jones I couldn't imagine anyone else but playing Sister Aloysius.  Well, the movie is slightly better than I had hoped.  It is awful in a way, but sticks in your mind even weeks after seeing it, so it must have something, right?<br /><br />It doesn't have subtlety, that's for sure.  The scenes of Meryl Streep battling the wind are more laugh inducing that the combined efforts of Jim Carrey and Steve Carell, and you can throw in the Marx Brothers too.  They must have suggested to Streep that she watch the silent classic THE WIND with Lillian Gish and then ordered her to out-Gish Gish, with some Marcel Marceau thrown in too.  I'm surprised she didn't pluck a flower and smell it, she is so hammy you have to love her.  That, and the lights going out, are movie devices you hardly ever see today, more's the pity.  In fact we don't have enough symbolism about Vatican II in general.  I lived through the whole era, and in fact had an inappropriate relationship with a priest, without any of the wind coming down and whipping our garments around our faces.  And it just gets worse and worse.  At least Streep and Hoffman look like they're having fun, as does Viola Davis, much more pragmatic about letting her son carry on with an older man than my mom ever was, God rest her soul.  Amy Adams on the other hand does more moral suffering than all the actresses in Cries and Whispers combined.  Why she ever took the part I don't know, but it's lousy and so is she.<br /><br />Don't hate me, DOUBT lovers.  I just call them like I see them.  And remember, that was my T-shirt the priest put in my locker, and I've got a right to give my opinion of what was basically the story of my life if I was black and teased.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Not quite your typical Hollywood budget movie, perhaps there wasn't enough influence to garner higher ratings from known movie critics.  The \\"people\\" however seem to be right on with better than average reviews.  What readers will want to know about this movie: 1) It's a fantasy/fiction love story, so you are one who likes to dream about something that could never happen in real life  2)  The enjoyment of the movie comes from scenarios that, with it's sum of compliments, creates an emotional connection  3)  The chemistry from director to actor to scenary is sublime.    Reason and logic don't apply here because, well, it's not supposed to.  You're supposed to get \\"lost\\" somewhere, and lost I got.    Don't forget to buy the soundtrack afterwards.  Excellent tracks by Paul McCartney, Nick Drake, Rachel Portman, and more to bring you back to the lakehouse.
B0000714BP|5.0|This is so great.  Love Patrick Swayze in all he has done. Did not know this existed.  You truly fall in love with all of the characters.
B0011HF6GE|3.0|3 1/2    Alluring, hushed folk can become muddled in repetitious acoustic phrasings throughout the entire course, but remains strong track-by-track if nothing more than for sincere delivery.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This show is like a Shakespearian drama set in the world of an outlaw bike gang. It's so good.     As a teenager I hung with bikers, and I have to say that of course there are \\"outlaw\\" biker gangs. There are also biker clubs who do charity work and hang together and ride for enjoyment who just love to ride.     But you can't claim that the Mongols, the Pagans, The Bandidos, The Hells Angels, The Outlaws and the Vagos aren't violent, criminal gangs. They produce, transport and distribute meth and all kinds of other drugs.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I read a review that said the CD was not a good one, but when I heard it played on Lola Granola's program (WOLF Station) I knew I needed to purchase it and have not regretted it one iota.[[ASIN:B001R7IHA0 Defying Gravity]]
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This Showtime Show is very addictive.  I think my daughter and I watched the whole 1st season in one day & I have already purchased the 2nd season (should receive today) from Amazon (of course)!!!!  I can't wait to watch it.  Very entertaining!!!  A must buy for the Crime/Drama type like myself:-)
B000VDDDY6|4.0|Very happy with this purchase.  The episodes are remastered and the colors just pop.  The added special effects are seamlessly added.  Only downside is the packaging, which is a bit frustrating and resulted in many of the title inserts to constantly fall out. Also, the discs are double-sided so they do have to be handled more carefully than regular dvds.  But the show itself is brilliant and as cutting edge as ever.
0316017922|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this insightful book.  I think it should be required reading of every educator in America (and every airline school in America!)  What he writes about makes so much sense when seen from his research.  I'm amazed that some people did not appreciate the book.  I thought it was organized, very well written, and the examples were always compelling.  I highly recommend this book...you won't be sorry.
B002501AGG|5.0|almost bought a Polar 400SD which would have been roughly the same price. Instead, this watch has all the same features plus GPS (Providing you buy the foot pod as well for indoor use)    Easy to set up and mind blowing amount of data during your workout using scrolling pages of customizable data fields, suggest you download the instruction manual from Garmin before you buy to appreciate the features.    Not sure about the Garmin Connect web software yet, might be better if you could compare workouts somehow to plot progress (Maybe it can do that and I just haven't worked it out yet).    The is also \\"Garmin Training Centre\\" which is a non web based bit of software - not sure how this is set up but it might have added functionality.     I like the bezel interface which is a bit like an Ipod control, the heart rate monitor and USB ant. both sinc and work perfectly.    All in all an excellent piece of technology which I'm sure will help my motivation to keep fit.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I received the controller just 3 days after I ordered it. It was brand new, as advertised, and worked perfectly. This was also the best price I can find a PS3 controller at, yes even cheaper then Gamestop. Thanks a lot.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I felt the characters were correctly cast, and it was superb. Nobody does classics like the BBC. I consider this in the same category as Pride and Prejudice (Firth & Ehle) and expect to watch it over and over.
1416955070|3.0|This book is quite interesting it's main character is Clary Fray. At first she seems like an ordinary teenager in the big city. However, one day when she goes to a club she witnesses a murder but she is the only one that sees what happens. Clary gains a new ability to see the mystical creatures invisible to ordinary humans but she has this gift not by accident. The book as a whole is interesting. The author creates this new world where many creatures like vampires, demons, witches .... exist side by side with humans but magic makes them invisible. The character of Clary seem to be very smart. She is an artist with talent for drawing. She is also a book lover that seems to like fantasy books. Since the character was build to have intellect therefore, it was annoying when she was missing the obvious. I think when you read a lot stories in which deception and evil character spin the action of the story you would know better then to trust a man whose stories change each time you speak to him. Therefore, it was irritating that Hodge Starkweather did not make Clary suspicious. As a whole, the Clary character was not as solid as it should be. Jace character on the other hand was written much better. He is funny and sarcasm is his protective mechanism. Without this character it would be a waste of time to read this book. I will start reading the city of Ashes and I hope that it will get better. Right now I am between 3 or 4 stars mainly because the story even though interesting, it was predictable.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|As usual, I enjoyed the movie,but what I really enjoy is having purchased it at such a good price!
015206396X|5.0|Lady Katsa is the main character of this book. She is born to a world where some people are born with special abilities. They can be recognized because they have different color eyes. A person that is graced can be a great swimmer, fighter, cook or can read minds. Katsa talent at first seems to be killing. Since her ability showed itself she became the lady killer of one of the kings of the seven kingdoms. People fear her grace so they keep a distance. On orders of the king she chops fingers or tortures in the most extravagant manner all men that defies the king. King thinks nothing of her, in his eyes she is simply a tool without a mind of her own. However, there is more to Katsa that meets the eye. Katsa meets Po who is also graced and because circumstances they join they forces in a common mission. The author wrote characters in this book very well. They almost seem like people that are alive on the pages of the book. The action and progress of the book is nicely paced according to the circumstances and allows for better exportation of the personalities that make the book good. I look forward to read Fire a second book by Kristin Cashore that further explores this new world but beyond the seven kingdoms.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|Don't make the same mistake I did... I bought the mp3 disc. I am now kicking myself, Steven Wilson puts so much effort into the production. Being a Porcupine Tree fan, I should have known better; I am going to have to repurchase the CD/DVD version. (Maybe Amazon should offer FLAC downloads next...)  Most popular music these days is produced for the masses. Songs are pretty much meant to be downloaded as singles, Insurgentes is the opposite of this. The album as a whole is a piece of art, and it should be enjoyed as one continuous piece of music. The more I listen to Insurgentes, the more I love it. The contrasts are breathtaking... crescendos into a wall of sound that drops off to a simple piano melody, classical harmonies blended with noises I didn't know the guitar could make...this is not easy listening. If you are a casual music listener, this disc is not for you. On the other hand, if you are a Wilson fan already, and you find that certain music captivates your soul as well as your ears, Insurgentes would be a great part of your collection.  I can't wait until the remix disc comes out, it should tide me over until the new PT release this fall!
B00007LTIA|5.0|\\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" is my favourite Yes album. Although they recorded great masterpieces before and after this, TFTO is when they were the ripest and mature enough to come up with such brilliant concept - a total challenge to untrained ears!  When the classic line-up consisting of Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire, Rick Wakeman and Alan White entered Morgan Studios in London in the summer of 1973, they recorded this magical journey of sound which amazes and uplifts me to this day! And what a magnificient journey it is!
0743277708|5.0|The book, actually, is not about rabbits.  Strange to say, because the characters in the book, virtually one and all, are rabbits.  But for clarification to those who don't understand, the Little Prince is not about miniature royalty, Jonathan Livingston Seagull is not about maritime fowl, and the Perfect Storm is not about the weather.  Having said that, you ought to read it.  It's about life, and good, and evil, and struggle, and triumph, and bravery, and sacrifice, and those things that make us human (or rabbit, if you prefer the literal version).  It is one of the best books I have ever read about humanity, and you will think about it for a long time after you read it, maybe for the rest of your life....
B001TWT0AE|3.0|I saw this film as a kid on a double-bill with Wayne's \\"Hatari\\"  With trailers, cartoon and short subject, well over a 6 hour show.  But I digress.  It has never been one of my favorite westerns, I've always considered it to be rather a maudlin, depressing film.  I bought this dvd in the hope that Peter Bogdonovich commentary would answer many of the questions I've had about the film such as why it was filmed in black and white and why Duke Wayne took the secondary role and second billing to James Stewart.  These questions were answered although sometimes there were more than one answer.  Regarding why the film was filmed in black and white, we are told that it was a combination of the old-age make-up at the beginning and end of the film, on Stewart and Vera Miles, looking better in black and white.  We are also told that the depressing subject-matter worked better in black and white and Ford tells us himself in a very nice 7 part retrospective that he simply liked filming better in black and white than  color.  I had always heard that Paramount had no faith in the film and did not want to spend the extra money that color filming entailed.  This never made sense to me: how could anyone not have faith in a film with both John Wayne and James Stewart at the top of their games? As for why Wayne took second billing and the secondary role, you'll have to hear for yourself.  I enjoyed the Bogdonovich commentary on this and the recent release of \\"El Dorado,\\" one of my favorite Wayne westerns.  This DVD also includes little commentaries by Stewart, Ford and Lee Marvin, taken from Bogdonovich interviews.  Like \\"El Dorado,\\" this includes a nice retrospective, trailer and pictures of the complete lobby card sets.  \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance\\" is still not one of my favorite westerns, but I did enjoy watching this new DVD and learning more about the making of this legendary film.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|GOOD: The special effects! The Enterprise was gorgeous (I loved all the beauty shots, such as when the ship rises out of the mist), and I loved feeling the BOOM in my chest when the ship went into warp (this is why you should see the movie in a theater). The visual and sound effects were the real stars of the movie. My favorite moment in the film is when the Enterprise shows up, guns blazing, for the final confrontation with Nero's ship. It's simply awesome to watch the fireworks - I only wish the battle wasn't so short.    Also good - Karl Urban's portrayal of Dr. McCoy was excellent. I wish there was more of him. Quinto did a pretty good job of Spock, considering that he had to share the screen with the real deal. I loved the homages to various things from the Original Series - Sulu's fencing, for example. Oh, speaking of Sulu, I liked the way his character was portrayed and expanded a little bit. He was my least favorite character in the Original Series, but he's fun in this movie. Chekov was pretty funny with the over-the-top accent (it's interesting how they turned him into a Wesley Crusher character, i.e., a teenage genius, but without making him annoying because his accent is so goofy). Finally, I loved the way Chris Pine says \\"Bones!\\" right at the end of the film - he said it just right. it's the only time he channels William Shatner, and it made me smile.    NOT GOOD: A few things - these didn't ruin the film for me by any means, but to be fair, I should point out the negatives as well as the positives. First, the biggest thing that didn't make sense at all was Kirk being made captain of the Enterprise at the end of the episode - he's a cadet! It takes years and years to become a captain (just ask Commander Riker, haha). In fact, it was pretty unbelievable that Pike suddenly made Kirk the first officer when he wasn't even supposed to be on the ship. It would be believable (though odd) if they made Spock a captain - after all, he's already a commander and he's the one who drew Nero's ship away from Earth by flying away in Old Spock's little ship. It seemed really contrived and unbelievable for Kirk to become captain that easily. Give him a medal. Maybe skip ahead a few years and show him becoming captain. That would make sense and wouldn't hurt the film at all.    Second, Spock and Uhura. I'm rewatching the Original Series and I can definitely notice a flirty relationship between Uhura and Spock (mostly on her part), so I think it would have been okay to simply imply that kind of attraction between them or even make it one-sided or merely flirtatious. But I don't think Spock would kiss Uhura in front of anyone. That's so not Spock. He *might* allow her to kiss him, but I don't think he would kiss back, certainly not in front of Kirk and the others. The other thing is that he's supposed to be engaged to a Vulcan girl... but perhaps that fact was erased in this alternate timeline (easy answer to anything, huh).    Third, Chris Pine's Kirk does not really seem like the Kirk of the Original Series. If you watch Star Trek, you'll notice that Captain Kirk is actually quiet a lot of the time, maybe with a sly smile on his face. He's very calm and cool, but can suddenly spring into action. Pine's Kirk just talks too much and seems like such an overactive, overgrown kid. I can't imagine him maturing into Shatner's Kirk. But again, this can be attributed to the alternate reality - his father died in this new timeline, so maybe that's altered his personality.    SUMMARY: I enjoyed the film but gave it a 4 because 5 would mean it's perfect, and it's not perfect. Whether you're a Trekker or not, just go into it with an understanding of what it is - a cool action flick that takes place in an alternate reality. Don't expect it to be at all like your expectations of Star Trek (whether you love Star Trek or despise it) - it's quite a different animal. If you keep this in mind, I don't think you'll be disappointed and may actually enjoyit a lot.    ABOUT THE REVIEWER: I'm not a stereotypical Star Trek fan  - I'm a 24-year-old Asian female, and I've never been to a convention, never worn a Star Trek costume or spoken Klingon to anyone, never even read a Star Trek novel. But I consider myself a real fan - I've seen all of the Original Series, the Next Generation, and Deep Space Nine, as well as all the movies, multiple times and own them on DVD.

0385341008|2.0|Although this was an entertaining story, ultimately it felt two dimensional and fell flat. I appreciated the research and the telling of, to me, a previously unknown chapter of World War II and it's aftermath.  Having said that, I found the author's characters steriotypical and trite. Ultimately it is a light, beach read, not true literature.

B0025X4P24|4.0|Its no secret that I love Vanessa Williams in terms of her acting and music presence. I have seen her in concert twice and each time has been phenomenal. I have had the chance to listen to the album for a while now and here is my review!<br /><br />1. Breathless.<br />Very sensual and romantic, with a catchy hook that keeps you humming breathless long after the song is over. Vanessa is known for her soft take on romance and this is a stellar track to open the album.<br /><br />2. Hello Like Before.<br />Love this one a lot. I love jazz, and what made this song really stand out is the clear, pitch perfect vocals, along with the string arrangements and oh that sax! The lyrics are memorable and poignant, and Vanessa pours such emotion into the song, its hard not to reminance on your past loves.<br /><br />3. Loving You.<br />Full blown jazz, that boasts great lyrics. I am not surprised Babyface penned this one. A sure winner at Weddings and smoky jazz clubs.<br /><br />4. Just Friends.<br />Great song. Vanessa is stunning in the video and caresses the ear with her pristine vocal styling and charisma. Again penned by Babyface, the tune is memorable and should do well on the charts with the right promotion. Get it on the airwaves.<br /><br />5. The Real Thing.<br />Vanessa loves to salsa. If you've been to her concerts, she always end with \\"Betcha Never\\" in full blown salsa splendor. This song is a hit. I was shocked at first when I realized it floated on a full blown spanish rhythm but immediately got sucked in with her perfect take on the Stevie Wonder written ballad. Again get it on the air, shrill it on Dancing with the stars, do a video for it. It's a solid track.<br /><br />The remaining tracks \\"Lazy Afternoon\\" and \\"Come On Strong\\", lie on the jazz scale with the former being a soothing afternoon ode of jazz and cocktails with the latter paying homage to Wilhelmina Slater. Its campy and playful, much like her character which as we know, if you're going to come to Willy, you better come on strong!<br /><br />\\"Close to You\\", to me is the most disappointing track. I like the song, but hate the arraignment. Vanessa sounds great, but the song falls a little flat because of its lackluster production. Its a shame because Vanessa looks downright sultry in the video.<br /><br />\\"I Fell In\\" seems strange among this collection, sounding more pop than along the lines of Jazz or latin music. The arrangement do get too heavy at times, obscuring rather than highlighting Vanessa's vocals. It doesn't quite reach the standards of \\"Save The Best For Last\\", but then again, what song can ever match the classic.<br /><br />October Sky, features a duet with Javier, whose second album I own. It was a pleasant surprise, though he's barely in the song vocally. Vanessa leads the way through much of the song, and thats fine because she sounds superb.<br /><br />And finally closing the album is \\"If there is no song\\", Vanessa once again mesmerizes us with fine vocals in breathy latin vibes.<br /><br />I must profess my excitement for Vanessa's return to music, it is much welcomed and very enjoyable. So fellow fans and music lovers, dig in and enjoy, all in all, the album is a solid hit.most disappointing track. I like the song, but hate the arraignment.

B001M5UDGS|4.0|This product is original, witty & corny in a good way. It has some wonderful key moments. The Dr Horrible/Penny/Capt Hammer triangle is interesting to say the least. I was not overly thrilled with the ending. It was just typical of Joss Whedon's one-note style, but other than that it's definitely worth checking out.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I've watched this twice now and really came to appreciate it on the second viewing.  The first time through, I was a little bit on the \\"what the hell was that?\\" side.  But I watched it again, and found that I really enjoyed it the second time.      The realistic feel of ordinary people facing unimaginable circumstances really came through with the use of the whole \\"handy cam\\" shooting style.  However, I can totally understand how some might find this frenetic style difficult to watch, especially when most of us are used to traditional cinematography style of the static camera, close-up, wide shot, reaction shot with its many cuts between characters and straightforward storytelling style.  This, however, is undeniably messy, and for me, that's what makes it effective.  The very long, hand held shots must have been a marvel of choreography, and what cuts there are, are cleverly worked in and interwoven.    Good casting of some relative unknowns.  When we're introduced to the characters at the party, it's almost like some indy film about 20-something relationships in NY which could have been kind of interesting just as that, but it really sets characters.  These folks are not heroes, nor are they particularly smart or brave.  In short, they're ordinary.  But then this catastrophic event happens and pushes them into making decisions and choices that were inconceivable just earlier that day.   And while surviving the rampaging monster is the catalyst, it's the relationships that take the film forward.  In particular, the scene where Rob must tell his mother about Jason is well done.    For the most part, the effects are well done, and there are some great action sequences such as the race to get to the subway, and helicopter escape.   It's truly exciting and scary in places.  Great sound effects.  Are moments implausible?  Sure.  But hey, Monster attacks New York -- I willing to suspend my disbelief.    Oh, loved the little easter egg the filmmakers put in the very lastscene off coney island.
0316044695|5.0|\\"Greater love hath no man than this, that he should lay down his life for a friend...\\"    These words were meant for Seal Team 10 and Marcus Luttrell. \\"Lone Survivor\\" is the true story of Operation Redwing and the almost indescribable valor of Seal Team 10. The story is told from the perspective of Marcus Luttrell, the only man of four SEALs to survive Operation Redwing. The four highly trained specialists infiltrate the mountains to root out and kill a Terrorist mastermind, responsible for the death of countless soldiers, when the SEALs are found by three shepherds. The decision is made to allow these three to live even though the release of these men might put the four into peril. Luttrell goes into great detail concerning the problems that face our soldiers in the Middle East: On the one hand they are charged with protecting the United States and finding Bin Laden and the rest of his gutless  wonders, on the other, is the real concern that our media (with the help of Al Jazeera) will turn their collective lives into a nightmare with accusations of murder etc. Sure enough, the choice to release the three shepherds brings 140 Taliban soldiers down upon them. These odds are too much even for the highly trained and skilled SEAL team 10 and Luttrell soon finds himself alone in enemy territory.     This is truly a story of courage and Love beyond what most of us can even imagine. Luttrell describes how team leader Michael Murphy sits down in the middle of hellish gunfire to make a phone call to rescue his men with full knowledge that to do so means Murphy's own death. Murphy takes a bullet in the chest, sits back up calmly to thank the men on the phone for responding. Though each of the men is mortally wounded, they fight on to protect the lives of their brothers. Their stamina, courage and love is a testament.      The responders hear only that their boys are in trouble and dying, and without another thought are off to rescue them. Sadly the helicopter is shot down and every man aboard killed.     In a time when the cult of celebrity is at its' peak. When Congress (to gain votes and endorcements from Liberals) has the audacity to create ROE's (Rules of Engagement) for real soldiers fighting real death, it's important to read this story of real heroes.     God Bless the SEAL's and all of the men and women in our armed forces willing to sacrifice their lives for the rest of us.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|i have listened to their record label debut and every thing up till ALL HOPE IS GONE  before i go deeper in to my review for this CD i did like slipknot when they first came out that is because i have not heard of them until late '03 ever since then i have loved every thing that they have done i have heard die hard slipknot fans say they did not like this album because it was a lot like VOL 3 which i also liked also this is by far the best album that slipknot has made if you are a fan and you expect Iowa then then you really are not a fan of slipknot to expect them to make the same album again this album is a step in maturity, Corey's singing and in the lyrics themselves i love the screaming every once in a while depends on the mood i am in but when i hear fan's or maggots as they are called by slipknot bitch about this album because it is to soft they strayed away from the sound that was in Iowa it pisses me of as maggot a fan of slipknot that you criticize them for maturing bringing in acoustic guitars i heard from another great musician that if it sounds good acoustic than it will sound better with electric guitars quoted by Brent smith from Shine down it is a very well rounded metal/rock album if you liked slipknot before then you like them now while listening to the album i imagining what the songs will sound like live i can only wait to hear and see them live i say this do not listen to anybody that says that this is a bad album because it is not they just want another Iowa album they just do not understand a band growing and maturing as a artist it is a must buy if you are a fan like i have before if you were a fan before but you are not now then you never was a fan of slipknot because you stick with that bend no matter how bad you think a album is that they came out with

You have find them in your computer and figure out how to get them to come up.

Since im familiar with the characters more with this book, i find it even more intesting than the first. This leaves off right after the first book. But u have to read book 3 to fully understand the entire trilogy.

1416914285|4.0|my lil cousin recommended this book to me while i was in my twilight phase, and said she'd prefer this over the twilight saga any given day. i thought i'd give it a try. the book cover captured me also. but this book is totally different than twilight. it doesnt have the kind of romance as twilight... but all in all it was an intersting read. it was very engaging and had me reading from beginning to end. there was alot going on all the time. no boring parts. i live in NY so i esp liked how it was featured in NY. this is also a series read. u have to read all 3 books to understand whats going on. and the ending for book 1 might get some ppl frustrated. but i dont want to spoil anything. everything makes sense after u read book 3. overall if you r looking for a book full of romance like twilight, this isnt it. this has lil to no romance. but..this is an exciting read, sorta like harry potter meets buffy meets charmed.
0143036556|4.0|The main theme of this lengthy and substantial book is that human beings invariably leave too great a footprint and that, given current human population levels, we've now just about infested the entire planet with nowhere else to go (barring substantial advances in space travel and better opportunities out there). As Jared Diamond shows again and again, through a large number of fairly well documented and examined examples, human societies tend to consume the environments in which they are established. While many societies have obviously survived and prospered to date (or we wouldn't now be threatening the entire planet, as Diamond sees it), our societies tend to rapidly consume the more fragile environments in which they take root, bringing on their own collapse. Now, as Diamond notes at this book's end, we've reached the point where we're testing the fragility of the Earth itself.<br /><br />In an earlier work (The Third Chimpanzee) Diamond focused on the kind of destructive primate that humans are as seen by an imaginary visitor from the stars. We would, he suggested, be looked on, not as a unique species, but as one (and, of course, the most successful) of three chimp species because we're so close in genetic makeup to chimps (of which there are two distinct species in the natural world, making us, of course, the third). In the present book Diamond returns to this earlier theme of human ecological rapaciousness and shows how archaeology and paleontology provide ample evidence of human societies repeatedly bringing about their own collapse through the ages. From modern Montana in the United States to the disasters that befell the Easter Islanders and their Polynesian kinsman on other fairly isolated islands (Pitcairn, Henderson and Mangareva) to the collapse of the southwest Pueblo native Americans to the Mayans, and on to the failed Norse experiment of Greenland and the destruction their Norse kinsmen wreaked on their fragile environment of Iceland. As Diamond demonstrates, the more fragile the environment, the more certain that humans will wreak havoc upon it.<br /><br />After reading the book through, though, it's hard to see how we could do anything else. Diamond makes a powerful case for the importance of a robust natural environment but everything he presents tells us we humans are devastating to that. When he gets to modern Haiti and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the Dominican Republic (two nations which share the same island of Santo Domingo) the damage that man has done to his habitat is nearly terrifying. If we can do this to a once lush and beautiful island like Santo Domingo, how can we avoid doing it everywhere as our numbers grow?<br /><br />He dutifully reports the devastation to be found in modern China, too, though offering a few salutary examples of societies which managed to recognize and reverse the process such as Shogunate Japan which, self-isolated from the rest of the world and with a powerful central government, managed to impose strict rules upon its constituent states to halt the stripping of that country's natural forests. Alas, as Diamond reminds us, Japan is less protective when it comes to plundering the planet's resources outside its borders and that is ultimately a problem since we're all on this one hunk of rock together, hurtling through space with no immediate prospects of anywhere else to go.<br /><br />The problem, unfortunately, is that Diamond's moderate optimism in the final chapter (that we can all do what the Japanese shoguns did in their country and what some New Guinea natives managed to do in theirs to halt the depredations of the entire planet) falters on the realization that his ultimate prescription is for massive change in how we live and in the level of prosperity we have become used to. Diamond is right to note that if the globe is teetering on the precipice of collapse, as Easter Island and the Mayan city states were in their era, then radical rethinking and massive behavioral changes are required. But it may well take a much more imminent disaster than we're currently facing and a much more powerful central state than the old Japanese Shogunate. And there is the problem. In the end, Diamond's argument is for humans to change their values, their preferences, their goals and even their beliefs about themselves, a prescription diametrically opposed to the values of individual freedom that have made us successful.<br /><br />If he's right, then such values are anachronisms just as the competitiveness that drove the Easter Island chiefs to plunder their tiny homeland in vain competition to outshine their fellows was and, ultimately is, disastrous. If he's right, then refusing to change and adapt must inevitably do us in as it did the Norse \\"chieftains\\" of Greenland who, he tells us, hoarded resources and refused to change their mode of living in order to continue as \\"Europeans\\" in a most non-European environment, an environment that offered survival only to those prepared to live more like the Innuit (Eskimos).<br /><br />Diamond wants us to go green but, more than that, he wants us to recognize the destruction we humans bring with us everywhere and change it by changing ourselves. Of course, the planet is not Easter Island. It's much, much bigger and more resilient but, as he notes, it's not infinite and a large enough human population will certainly exhaust it. Nor, he reminds us, will we necessarily know when we cross the point of no return as the Easter Islanders did not know on their little homeland which hasn't regenerated itself to this day. Nor, he reminds us, has Iceland, where humans have managed to persist. Our own country, he notes is rapidly losing its forests, clean water and native species, too.<br /><br />If the Third Chimpanzee is invariably destructive, Diamond wants to tell us we can only change the outcome by altering what we are. We need central controls and plans to save the planet that can be enforced and, most importantly, we need to stop hungering for more and accept a less consumption-oriented global civilization. How \\"green\\" must we be? We cannot be \\"green\\" enough, he seems to be telling us, and that looks like a problem because people don't change their values easily nor is it always clear to all that they should, even if it seems clear to some. Diamond's prescriptions don't work unless the vast majority of mankind signs on or a strong enough centralized state takes over and forces the issue the way the Chinese government forced massive population control. People in the third world have to voluntarily surrender their potential to live like today's first worlders and those of us in the so-called first world have to set the example by accepting lower living standards than we have become accustomed to. Ouch!<br /><br />While everything comes to an end, and it's not unrealistic to expect our world to do so as well at some point in the future, Diamond argues that we can stave that off longer than would otherwise be the case and make those salvaged years more rewarding for our posterity by bequeathing them a green world instead of a denuded planet. But aside from the challenge of achieving such change (movement away from fossil fuels, reduction in populations, reduction in the agricultural use of land, etc.), what about the cost of altering our values enough to accept a larger, more powerful, more intrusive state?<br /><br />On a different front, I was especially interested to see what Diamond had to say about Greenland because, a few years back, I wrote an historical novel partly set there. I wanted to see if the Greenland he depicted matched the country I had envisioned based on the research I had done and, to my pleasant surprise, it did. The reasons Diamond gave for the Norse collapse there largely mirrored the society I had depicted in its formative stage with all the problems already inherent in its system, prompting me to a certain respect for Diamond's assessment, even if I think his thesis overly grim and his proposed solutions nearly unlikely, at least at this stage in human history. And that's pretty depressing because I share with Diamond a passion for the natural world we humans seem bent on washing away under our feet.<br /><br />Stuart W.

0316166685|5.0|The book was received in good condition and on time to read it for my Book Club
B001QBC4AG|4.0|Widely considered to be among the best records of the 1960's, and by many thought to be The Who's greatest recording: \\"The Who Sell Out\\" once again, has received a major overhaul. This \\"Deluxe Edition\\" features 2 full CD's of the classic album in complete stereo and mono versions, and another albums worth of unused songs, commercials, jingles, radio spots and alternate tracks.<br /><br />The original album was recorded between April and October of 1967. This was a very hectic year for The Who, between live dates, TV appearances, and trips to America, the band somehow found time to record, in studios in London and the USA. It was all rushed together in November, so the album would see a release prior to the Christmas holiday.<br /><br />The concept behind: \\"The Who Sell Out\\" was all about the pirate radio that was broadcasting offshore England in 1967. The entire radio format is reproduced by The Who. Radio spots, commercials, jingles and pop songs of the highest caliber were all the work of Pete, Roger, John & Keith. The power pop, heard on the band's 1966 recording: \\"A Quick One\\" builds to enormous explosion with this project.  Power pop, comes into full bloom on: \\"The Who Sell Out.\\" This is the last of the first wave of Who records, as the next project would be very different from this.<br /><br />Some of The Who's finest music can be found on this record. With: \\"Tatoo\\", \\"I Can See For Miles\\", \\"I Can't Reach You\\" & \\"Rael\\" this is finely crafted rock/pop music that doesn't show it's age in 2009. Good pop music is timeless, and The Who understood this, that is the secret to this album's greatness.<br /><br />With this expanded and remixed edition, sound clarity of this project has improved, but due to the limitations of equipment of it's time,{and Kit Lambert} \\"Sell Out\\" may never sound the way we want it to, but it has gotten better. The early demo of: \\"Relax\\" fearures some jazz piano and has a 'laid-back' feel to it. \\"Jaguar\\" is an all-out eruption of Who fury. \\"Sodding About\\" is a jam, much like: \\"The Ox.\\" \\"Glittering Girl\\" is a feast for the ears here, the mix has new found clarity and depth. Even: \\"Someone's Coming\\" {a song I never cared for} comes alive here as there is much more prominence to the instruments, now heard.<br /><br />With four different versions of: \\"Rael\\" included here, you will hear music that was buried in the old mixes. An early: \\"Summertime Blues\\" will reveal how many years the band would age between 1967 and 1970. A surprise hidden track, is included at the end of disc two, with some things I won't disclose here {it would be like unwrapping a Christmas gift early!}<br /><br />The last edition of this record was released in 1995. \\"Melancholia\\" and \\"Glow Girl\\" were a part of that version. The reason, that they are not included here, is because they were recorded after the completion of sessions for: \\"Sell Out\\" {they are both from 1968.} The Radio One spot {Boris Mix} is also absent here.<br /><br />Again, it is fair to say that The Who, do reach a peak on this record, that they will never achieve again. The band sounds so young and spikey here, that it is a little hard to believe that they have to grow up with: \\"Tommy\\" and become a different group, a rock group. In 1967, Pete, Roger, John & Keith still sound like teenage punks....well power pop punks!<br /><br />My only issue with this set is the mono still sounds compressed. This fantastic  band cannot be contained in it. Some prefer the mono to the stereo versions, and I don't agree to that. The Who, were way ahead of the equipment that they were forced to record on. You would need 64 separate tracks to let this music breathe the way it needs to.<br /><br />Sound issues aside, this is about the purist glimse into the music of the sixties, that you are going to find. This is a great record, the extras add to the fun and excitment of sounds that are hardly being contained herein. I am not deducting a full point to due sound problems. The music of: \\"TheWho Sell Out\\" is an 11 !!!<br />4.75 Stars !!!

B001PA0FFO|5.0|John Patrick Shanley has turned his prize-winning stage drama into a cinema version that is richly flavored and expands slightly on his theme of power, corruption and moral authority in a Catholic Church during the 1960s. At the heart of the tale is a progressive-minded priest (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is viewed as highly suspect by a tyrannical nun (Meryl Streep) who personifies all that was wrong with the strict nuns who thought that harsh discipline and humiliation was the way to rule the school classroom. The old vs. the new is what happens when these two clash.<br /><br />Very unlike what happened when Hollywood first tackled the subject of old vs. new in films like GOING MY WAY and THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S where a young priest has to cope with the unchanging steel will of a crusty old parish priest.<br /><br />Here the subject matter is much more serious too, involving the suspicions of a nun eager to seize on any reason for ridding the parish of Father Flynn whom she accuses of an immoral act with a young altar boy in his charge, based on very flimsy evidence of another naive young Sister James (Amy Adams).<br /><br />The story becomes a character study of these three as they confront the issues raised by the domineering Sister Aloysius (Streep) who insists on a private meeting with Flynn in which the accusations fly fast and furious. This scene is super-charged with emotion and dramatically effective--but even more striking fireworks are yet to come when we meet the mother of the boy (Viola Davis) who is brilliant in her two big scenes with Streep during which another twist is given to the tale.<br /><br />To tell any more would be to spoil this for anyone not familiar with the material. Clearly, Shanley has written a very powerful drama and staged it with simplicity and truth in a way that is cinematic without losing any of its dramatic force as a play.<br /><br />For the performances alone, highly recommended as a thinking man's morality play that never quite gives you the feeling that you know all the answers to the riddle presented. It's open to many interpretations, but there's no doubt about one thing--this is a stark, emotional drama and Shanley makes the transfer to screen full of cinematic magic.w all the answers to the riddle presented.

B000NZIP5E|5.0|Zakk Wylde, Ozzy's lead guitarist, put out a southern-rock record under the moniker Pride & Glory in the mid-'90s & then issued a solo album called \\"Book of Shadows.\\" But it wasn't until he formed Black Label Society (BLS), that he really hit his stride.    This Japanese release by Mercury Records back in 1998 is truly the beginning of this mad-man's BLS project. It even features the original cover artwork. They had to change it soon after after receiving a legal cease & desist letter from Johnnie Walker, Inc. Cease & desist? How about an endorsement? The higher-ups at that company sure missed the boat considering how much Zakk & Co. drink on a daily basis!    BLS's sound is quite simple. It's equal parts Black Sabbath & Lynyrd Skynyrd. Heavy, heavy riffs with Wylde's swampy southernesque, Jersey-boy vocals. And there's usually at least one or two instrumentals and/or acoustic numbers tossed in among the heavy metal tracks. This import release has 13 tracks & the production/mix is over-the-top heavy. The bass is so distorted & up-front in the mix that you wonder if it was done on purpose or not. But BLS were out to take a stand & make a stand. They wanted to annihilate the No Doubt & Bush's of the world with their scorched earth assault. And they succeeded. The best songs are \\"Bored to Tears,\\" \\"Born to Lose\\" & \\"Spoke in the Wheel.\\" However, they're all good & Zakk shows of his musicianship with the speed-ball that is \\"T.A.Z.\\" Fans of Ozzy will love this. Fans of Black Sabbath will love this. Fans of G N' R will love this. In fact, fans of all hard-rock/metal/southern-rock, etc. will be thrilled to have a new band to follow. Considering it's now 11 years later, Zakk shows absolutely no signs of slowing down & he's put out 10 discs under the BLS name. So get on this train & hold on tight. You know Zakk's got the energy to play straight through the night.
0821221841|5.0|This is a great book for anyone interested in enhancing their knowledge about film photography.  I'd recommend it for anyone interested in purchasing and using a film camera.  Just as the title suggests, this book is about the camera itself.  There's a useful chapter on lenses that will help you decide which type of lens to buy for your shooting needs.  Plus there's a good chapter on image management: how to compose shots to create visually interesting photographs.      I've read all three books in this series, and while they do lean on the technical side I still consider them essential references for film camera enthusiasts.
B0001Z363W|4.0|After \\"The Blessed Hellride,\\" Spifire Records wanted Zakk to put out another album of the same kind of rock that all BLS fans had become accustomed to. One problem with that idea was that Zakk wasn't having it. He wanted to do something different and that's exactly what he did.    \\"Hangover Music Vol. VI\\" is a pseudo-acoustic affair. It's got fifteen tracks. They're all good including a song called \\"Layne,\\" which is a tribute to Alice In Chains' fallen singer. \\"Crazy or High\\" is also a solid track & it leads off the album. The only hang-up I have is that most of these tracks are slightly-amped. For my tastes, Zakk is at his best when he is either tearing up his electric guitar and pummeling his audience with riff after amazing riff or it's when he's strictly on an acoustic & churning out songs such as \\"Spoke in the Wheel,\\" \\"Like A Bird\\" and 'Lost Heaven.\\" I would've loved a full album of tracks just like that because I favor them over these slightly-amped/pseudo-acoustic numbers. But, once again, the man does deliver & there's plenty of good material on this disc. BLS fans will want this in their collection &, at the end of the day, that's what matters most.
1932907009|5.0|I work in film and this is THE most on target book on screenwriting I have seen. I don't totally agree with everything he has to say.  I think he's a bit skewed by the genre he wrights in (PG comedies) but I do think he's still 99% correct.  Films are stories and stories have pretty much fit into a number of molds since people started telling them.  We pretty much all want to hear the same stories, with interesting variations.  And what Blake has done is put into modern terms the formulas that work.  But WAIT you say I don't like formulaic stories...  An ancient greek writer put down the 13 plots that made up all stories, Blake refines it and breaks it down a bit further but essentially ALL stories fit into one of the formulas.  It's not about the formula it's about HOW you tell it.  What's great about StC is he breaks down the formulas.  You still have to say it in a new and interesting way but the structure is laid out.  If you spend a lot of time working it all out and you come up with a great script you will find it ends up fitting one of the formulas.  So save some time Read the book and follow Blakes breakdown, your going to end up there anyway.  And if you just love movies but have no interest in writing one, read it anyway.  It will give you insight as to how things are being worked out, it's not a spoiler its a door opening up.

Ruth Wilson is particularly effective in her role, and the film is well cast in all the major players.  Highest recommendation.

Robin Hobb has done an excellent job of painting the picture of the life of solitude that Fitz has made for himself and the pull that his former life has on him. While not a whole lot happens in the span of this novel, it is none the less important to the development of Fitz and Dutiful. The insights provided to further explain the Fool's character are especially fascinating and I can't wait to dig even deeper in the next two books.

B000002LQD|5.0|When this CD came out, I was 21 and I just lost my gramps to lung cancer (DONT SMOKE!).  I was a heavt metal, long haired head banger back then. For some reason I bought this CD on one of those CD mailing clubs.  I put this in and was transformed musically and spiritually.  This CD is amazing and it was like Lou was there with me along the way of my gramps demise.  There even lyrics in it that relate exactly to incidents that ocurred during his decline. Anyway, aside from that, the songs on here are great. They are well written and just have tons of feeling in them. You can tell Lou went deep into his heart when he wrote this. This is easily in my Top 10 CD list.  Rock on!
B001U0HBPG|1.0|F. Scott Fitzgerald made \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" a poignant but whimsical and often funny tale of a man born old who grows young. Hollywood twists this short story beyond recognition.     In Fitzgerald's version, the father is discombobulated but takes his gray-haired, withered newborn home and has him dye his hair and otherwise try to masquerade as a young 'un. The film father tries to drown and then abandons his son. Fitzgerald's Benjamin woos and marries the belle of the ball; as she ages, he uses his burgeoning energy to attend parties and master the latest dance steps. In the big screen version, romance ends in tragedy.    Thus does the film convey Hollywood's idea of a serious message, to wit, \\"Life sucks, then you die.\\" Some reviewers have noted the similarity to 1994's FORREST GUMP. Was that the last time a Hollywood movie with a happy ending won Best Picture?    This reviewer is happy the Jazz Age master isn't around to see what they did to his odd little yarn.
0307276902|2.0|\\"A Million Little Pieces\\" by James Frey<br /><br />James Frey awakens to find himself on a commercial airliner bound for Chicago. Apparently he has been placed on the plane by a doctor and will be met by his parents when he lands who will deliver him to one of the best addiction treatment centers in the country. Although only 23, James' addiction to alcohol and crack amongst other things has done substantial damage to his body and if he doesn't quit now it isn't likely that he will see 24.<br /><br />As a stand alone \\"Fiction\\" book, \\"A Million Little pieces\\" isn't too bad. As a factual memoir it isn't too great. Obviously since its release Frey has come out and admitted that many parts of the book were embellished. My only question is how did anyone believe it was true to begin with? There is no point in rehashing all the details, but there is no shortage of things in this book that are not believable in the least and it makes you wonder how Oprah and crew so easily had the wool pulled over their eyes.<br /><br />The Good: The story is somewhat compelling and places the main character in some interesting situations and the character himself while not a likeable person definitely has an interesting history and is probably the only redeeming characteristic of this book.<br /><br />The Bad: Normal punctuation and grammatical rules are completely ignored in this book. This was completely annoying because you are never quite sure when someone is speaking and when they stop. The way the author tries to remedy this was quite annoying as well ala:<br /><br />Leonard speaks<br />That's it?<br /><br />I don't know if this is supposed to be an extension of the author/character's `rebel, rebel, down with rules' attitude but it just makes for an annoying read.<br /><br />As stated the main character is not likeable so this makes it hard to root for him or care about him in any way. This is compounded by the character's constant chest puffing attitude towards the center's staff and doctors and his constant proclamations that he doesn't need to do it their way. The lack of believability also makes it tough to suspend disbelief (even though it is fiction).<br /><br />Overall: With all the hype surrounding and even Oprah getting behind it I was expecting something solid. What I got was something so so. If this genre interests you give \\"[[ASIN:0061656836 Futureproof: A Novel (P.S.)]]\\" a try.nd doctors and his constant proclamations that he doesn't need to do it their way.

B0025X4P24|4.0|It has been 4 years since Vanessa Williams came out with a great album. When her last album was released, 2005's Everlasting Love, it sadly and somberly was overshadowed by radio, and she was going through a tough divorce with her 2nd husband former basketball star Rick Fox. She also was dealing with the tragic death of her father whom was a school teacher. But, she always has a great deal of joy that does come in the horizon. That has shown with her comeback to acting on ABC's hit Ugly Betty, a role in the wildly popular Hannah Montana movie, and a honored star on Hollywood's Walk Of Fame. She definitely still has shown a graceful beauty heart and soul to her devoted fans. Now, she is back with a new twist to her voice, and it swoons the soul beautifully.<br /><br />The Real Thing, Vanessa Williams first album in 4 years, really brings in a sophisticated and seductive appeal to her voice, by blending in a smooth and strong mix of Jazz, Quiet Storm, R&B and Latin rhythms very well. The album includes a lot of great songs including the seductive Breathless, the smooth standard Lazy Afternoon, and the soulful Hello Like Before, all into one unique package. While the album doesn't dissapoint for hard core fans, I honestly was hoping for a few more upbeat songs to tide me over. While Vanessa doesn't bring in the upbeat dance R&B vibe, as was the case with her first few albums, The Right Stuff and The Comfort Zone, Vanessa still reels in the songs well, with her sultry voice which has never lost its luster and shine after 21 years into her career as a singer, and strong and simple arrangements that are just great for a easy listening afternoon of pure blissful pleasure.<br /><br />All in all, The Real Thing is honestly one of the best albums I've heard so far this year, and I definitely enjoyed hearing Vanessa Williams swoon her heart out. While this year hasn't actually brought out very strong records, Vanessa Williams still knows how to make great music, and sing a great high note. If you're a hard core fan of Vanessa Williams, or new to her music, than this is a great buy for your music collection. I absolutely recommend the album.<br /><br />Album cover: A-<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Mastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B+f you're a hard core fan of Vanessa Williams, or new to her music, than this is a great buy for your music collection.

B001GM28HO|5.0|I heard Just Dance and Poker Face on the radio and had to buy the CD!  I think that the whole album is great!  As a matter of fact, Lady Gaga really does have The Fame!  She keeps an exceptional tempo to her lyrics, and the electronica genre that she adds makes for a great party time.
B0024FADAQ|4.0|The Last Starfighter is essentially a space opera hinged on the fantasy that video game skills will save the day. Obviously this movie was made for the young teen crowd (essentially 13 yr old boys with Ataris/ Intelivisions/ColecoVisions/etc) and has its share of action and comedy that, like most space operas in the 80's, has more than one similarity to Star Wars (but then again Star Wars was a homage to the classic space operas of the golden age of television). So it's not high caliber sci-fi, but it's not B-movie fodder either.     The story is pretty simple: Evil leader of evil aliens wants to attack good aliens, so in walks a single hero who is the last hope for freedom. That's about it. The movie doesn't deviate too far from this premise other than to further flesh out the fish-out-of-water scenario of an 80's Earthling thrust into space (as well as a little fun with an alien in 80's Earth) as well as the inner battle of said Earthling to stay and fight for a Star League he doesn't know or stay home and go to community college. A serviceable story, if not deep.     The acting does make the simple story enjoyable to watch. Lance Guest seems to have fun with the role, which works for the character. Biggest props go to esteemed Robert Preston's Centauri, who plays the role with the style of a magician and the charisma P.T. Barnum. Another esteemed actor, Dan O'Herlihy, does a surprisingly good performance. Especially when you consider he is wearing full prosthetics with less facial mobility than the costumes from the original Planet of the Apes. Yeah there is a bit of theatrical \\"drama\\", but that works with the whole space opera motif.     Special effects are a benchmark here because this is the first film to incorporate live action elements to computer generated animation. The CGA is pretty barbaric by today's standards and even back then was noticeable. The biggest glare in this are the scenes flying in around asteroids, which look pretty \\"plastic\\" CG-wise. However the CG ships looked awesome and you can't beat the camera angles and fly-byes that computer animation affords. Plus back then this was pretty state of the art.     Not a lot of details have come out regarding The Last Starfighter 25th Anniversary DVD, but this is what I found out so far:    - Digitally remastered video (finally!) so it should be MUCH cleaner than the first DVD release. Anamorphic wide screen.     - It will have the same commentary with director Nick Castle and production designer Ron Cobb as in the first DVD release.     - It will have the documentary Crossing the Frontier: Making The Last Starfighter. This also was on the previous DVD release and as far as 30 minute featurettes are concerned it covers all the bases well.      - A new featurette, Heroes of the Screen, will be included. Will post more information when I found out.     - Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround in English and subtitled in English (SDH), Spanish and French.     - Theatrical and teaser trailer.     - Image gallery is likely, but not confirmed to be the same as the original release. This includes images from an alternate ending.     Now they are releasing a Blu-Ray version too and as far as features are concerned will be identical to the DVD release. The differences are of course 1080p high def picture, 5.1 DTS-HD audio and BD-Live.     This movie is definitely a time capsule for 80's science fiction. If you like that sort of charm then by all means pick this one up. If you already have the original DVD you may still want to grab this for the remastered picture surround sound more than just to have the one new featurette.

0316044695|5.0|A great book despite having been edited by what must be a plant by the Taleban!    Marcus: thank you. Simply amazing.    But what in God's name are we doing for these villagers? Where is the protection? This man, Gulab and his village must not be forgotten! Marcus would not be alive today if it was not for these villagers!!!!    Where is the eternal gratitude that must imply action not words!     \\"Little help for his trouble    Nearly two years later, Gulab's act of mercy has cost him the life he knew as a woodsman in his mountainside village of simple mud and timber homes. Gulab, 33, has fled his home in the village, Sabray, moving his wife and six children to the thin safety of the government-held town of Asadabad. Still, he says, the Islamic militant guerrillas pass on threats to kill him.    Gulab and others in Afghanistan's Kunar province say neither Luttrell nor the U.S. military has done much to help him. That, they say, may discourage other Afghans from following his example in defending U.S. soldiers.    Soon after the rescue of the seal, the U.S. military gave Gulab a construction laborer's job at its Asadabad base, paying him $280 a month. He moved his family to a rented house in the town.    Then, last April, American soldiers at the base arrested him. \\"They put handcuffs on me and a sack and earmuffs on my head,\\" Gulab said. For five days, \\"they accused me of meeting Taliban and people from Pakistan. I felt ashamed. I couldn't eat anything. I haven't told any of my own people about this; it is a great shame to me.\\"    Gulab's arrest followed a Newsweek story about his rescue of Luttrell and interrogators questioned him about his having met a Pakistan-based correspondent for the magazine, he said. U.S. forces released him without explanation, he said.    The arrest was acknowledged by the top U.S. officer at Asadabad, Navy Cmdr. Ryan Scholl, in response to queries from Newsday. The U.S. Special Operations Command in the Middle East said it was checking on the incident but had no immediate comment.    Far from supporting the Taliban, Gulab said, he is still threatened by them. \\"People come down [from the Shuraik Valley] and tell me that the Taliban have warned them that I will be killed whenever they get the chance,\\" he said.    If he has kept his enemies, he feels he has lost his friends. \\"Before, I used to go to their [the Americans'] rooms freely and talk with them,\\" Gulab said. But since the arrest, \\"they don't allow me on the base.\\"    Every two weeks, Gulab is permitted to go to the base's gate to collect his salary for a job from which he said he is now barred. \\"Nowadays, my situation is very fragile,\\" he said. \\"My security from the Taliban is not good . . . They can easily reach to Asadabad and find me.\\"    If Gulab is mistrusted by the Americans, he is admired by many locals as a good Pashtun who did the right thing for his own honor, said Ruhollah Anwari, a prominent Afghan journalist in Asadabad.    \\"I am not sorry that I helped him,\\" Gulab said of Luttrell. While he said he did not save the American with the expectation of a reward, he said he hopes the U.S. will help him out of his predicament. \\"If they help me, they will get the reputation that they help their friends,\\" he said. \\"In general, I am very sad,\\" adding that he has had no contact with the SEAL he saved. \\"I think he has forgotten me.\\"
B001KVZ6FM|4.0|Ed Asner talks for a grumpy old man who always dreamed of adventure along with his late wife. After accidentally hurting someone, he's about to be sent to an old folks home. So he attaches a bunch of balloons to his house and is off to Paradise Falls. Since it's the one place him and his wife always wanted to go.<br /><br />  Along for the ride is a boyscout who just happened to be on the property when the house lifted off. He rather just be alone though with his house and the memories of his wife. But he also winds up with more company than he'd like when the trio meets a talking dog and a rare bird while at Paradise Falls.<br /><br />  The movie is sentimental and touching at times. The first 10 minutes especially had me weeping lol. But don't worry, it's not Marley & Me and the movie is more funny than it is sad. It's uplifting in fact. While the talking dogs that work for the villain are hilarious. I also loved the musical score. In closing, just see Up.
B0026JWDQW|4.0|As though in an attempt to banish once and for all, all those James Morrison/James Blunt comparisons, Scottish singer Paolo Nutini returns on his sophomore disc \\"Sunny side up\\" with a more diverse array of sounds. From Bob Marley-lite Reggae (\\"10 out of 10\\"), Bob Dylanesque Folk (\\"Growing up beside you\\", the acoustic \\"Tricks of the trade\\"),  bouncy Blues-tinged (\\"Pencil full of lead\\") to Country-tinged (\\"Candy\\"), he tries it all, and for the most part, it works.<br /><br />There's still some of his blue-eyed soul though; songs like the organ drenched \\" Coming up easy\\",  the Bluesy \\"No other way\\", and the Jackie Wilson/Marvin Gaye-channelling \\"High hopes\\".<br /><br />Other standouts are the beautiful \\"Worried man\\" (which sounds like it should be on some soundtrack to some Western), and the tender retro ballad \\"Keep rolling\\" with layered sombre harmonies.<br /><br />Highly melodic, and filled with witty lyrics, this charming disc just grows and grows.
6305882592|5.0|The film, didn't make me have any expectations initially, but as I started watching it, I was amazed. The film has been made with such flamboyancy and so beautifuly, you just can't afford to take your eyes off the screen, its a pleasure to watch Ruth Gordon in the role of 'Maude'. She is just, just impossible, she just steals the whole show. The boy in the role of 'Harold' did a terrefic job as well. The chemistry between them shone all the way throughout the film. The film was not just a pleasure, it will also teach you certain things about life. You will definately love this sweet piece of cinema. Its a unique film, definately worth watching again and again.
B001O8C5KK|5.0|My favorite Butterfly recording has always been the Freni/Pavoratti/Karajan version but this new one brings a welcome freshness to the opera. This isn't just another ho hum interpretation but, rather, one that is thought out and carefully considered in all its elements. Gheorghiu is fabulous (as always) and Jonas Kaufmann gives the role of Pinkerton a different sound and approach. Pappano's conducting brings out all the pathos in this great score.
B001SF8G1Q|4.0|Wow, I am pleasantly surprised by this 2009 remastered edition. From the pleasant album opener \\"If Not for You,\\" I knew I was in for something special. The sound quality reveals layers I hadn't noticed before -- most noticeable to my ears was the crispness and clarity of the acoustic guitars, as well as Al Kooper's great organ accompaniment. The songs vary in style from the romantic waltz of \\"Winterlude,\\" the jazzy \\"If Dogs Run Free\\" (complete with scat-style vocals by Maeretha Stewart), the soulful \\"The Man in Me,\\" the spoken word spirituality of \\"Three Angels\\" and the brief gospel-tinged \\"Father of Night.\\" What the songs have in common is the sheer quality of writing and a lot of heart. Dylan is backed here by a fine group of Nashville session players, who add much to the arrangements. This album has a laid-back feel, but never comes across as lazy or half-hearted. Also, the packaging is nice as well, featuring some in-studio photographs and musician credits. In short, I have new respect for this recording after hearing the remaster. Defintely recommended. Just make sure you're getting the 2009 remaster, not the inferior earlier version.
0743290119|4.0|A good read that doesn't require a huge amount of thinking, which makes it a good chick lit book... also the type of read that shows a life that is not possible for most of the world - making it all the more fun to read.
B00008EY7H|5.0|Very entertaining and wonderful price
0679720200|3.0|First and foremost, I probably don't have to write about what a famous and influential book this is since, odds are, if you're looking at this book (and my review) you are already somewhat familiar with that fact.    That being said, I found this book rather dull from a literary standpoint. It's quintessential existentialism and Camus at his finest. There is no overarching, plot driving feature to this book. However, it does focus on the protagonist's struggle to find meaning and purpose as he goes through the French judicial system after committing murder. As a philosophy major, it appears to me that \\"The Stranger\\" has more philosophic value than literary or entertainment value.     I would recommend this to anyone wanting to broaden their knowledge of 20th century philosophy, continental philosophy, or existentialism.........or Hemingway lovers.

B000A6T1JU|4.0|Walter Hill's THE WARRIORS was a remarkable film when it emerged in 1980. Based on Xenophon's legendary military tale ANABASIS, about a gang of soldiers cut off from their homeland and outnumbered on enemy turf, it retains a mythic atmosphere, and Hill admitted its rhythms and style were much based on comic books. (The film was apparently a favorite of President Reagan's, which may be an apocryphal fact but which makes perfect sense when you considering his own cinematic career.) Hill makes some terrific choices, including a kind of \\"chorus\\" part enacted by the great Lynn Thigpen (see only as a mouth in extreme close-up) as a radio DJ announcing the plans to attack the Warriors after they've been framed for murdering a legendary visionary gang leader. And the film genuinely has visual dazzle, with New York City figured as a hot graffiti-riddled neon wasteland inhabited almost solely by gangs and cops.    Even so, the film has unfortunately dated more than you'd think. The gangs (all gathered together in the Bronx in the film's beginning by the visionary, Cyrus) each have a distinctive look which every member in the gang wears, such as purple forties hats or (in the case of the titular heroes) red leather vests. This has the unintendedly humorous consequence of making the gangs all look like Olympic synchronized swimming teams, or like Seventies rock bands: in fact, in one of the film's most famous sequences, the Warriors face off against the Baseball Furies, a gang that wear baseball uniforms and full face make-up clearly inspired by KISS and Alice Cooper. (One of the film's few jokes is that the Baseball Furies turn out to be wimps; \\"I should have guessed,\\" one of the Warriors remarks after defeating them.) The presence of Michael Beck as Swan, the Warriors' de facto leader for most of the film, might remind you of his next film XANADU, which in its conclusion also featured groups of men and women in fabulous costumes also set against a musical background. (The by-and-large unthreatening gang members here look like they might easily have been re-outfitted to be the rollerskaters, muses, and pop-and-lock dancers from that later film.) Neither Beck nor his lady love, the luscious-lipped Deborah van Valkenburgh, are very gifted in their line readings, although they're both quite memorably beautiful--they might be style icons of the year 1980. You'll see instantly why this film has a confirmed cult status.
B000053VAZ|3.0|Benny & Joon is a mediocre example of a typical made-for-TV-movie. Except for Johnny Depp.    The scenes without Mr. Depp, featuring Aidan Quinn & Mary Stuart Masterson in the title roles, tend to drag, despite the best efforts of the actors. When Depp comes into the scene, there's suddenly life. It's truly amazing.    Overall score for movie: C      With Johnny Depp: B+
B00000F14B|5.0|An all-time favorite. Great music and great talent. Shirley Jones and Robt. Preston are wonderful and Ron Howard is such a young little fellow in this movie and cute as a bug. Wonderful classic.
B00005A3KS|2.0|This is a relatively fast-paced, no-brainer action flick. The trouble is in the details. Many, many details.    The 1st & biggest problem in my view is where are they? Oh sure, the script says Southern California, but I lived in SoCal for over 25 years (I was living there when this was released to theatres) & I can tell you that there are NO beaches like that anywhere in California. The waves are large & tubular. There are very few surfers on them. The sand is empty of onlookers. There is vegetation nearly to the water. The movie supposedly takes place during August & September (the hottest months in SoCal), yet the surfers are all wearing wetsuits. Trust me, NO surfers would wear wetsuits at that time of year.    Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) lives on the beach in a rather large cottage. With no neighbors. Assuming (as a bank robber) he could afford a beach house, believe me, there are simply no isolated 'shacks' anywhere in SoCal. Another 'little' detail gone wrong.    It was nice seeing Anthony Keidis (lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) in a cameo role as a hot-headed surf nazi beating up on Keanu Reeves' character, but Keanu himself runs the gamut of emotions from A to B. Just like all his other films. Patrick Swayze does what he can with Bodhi, but the mis-casting is obvious from the start.     Final verdict? If you must see this film, rent it first. Trust me on this.
0783225857|5.0|This movie is an \\"all time favorite\\"/ \\"oldie but goodie\\"! Gregory Peck is fabulous in this wonderful classic. Take a good look at Boo Bradley and try to guess who plays the part. Amazing! Have enjoyed this movie since my youth.
B002B8BU6C|5.0|As a big fan of film, especially historical propaganda, Triumph of the will is probably the greatest example in existence.  This film progresses over the 4 days of the 6th Congress of the Nazi Party in Nuremburg, Germany and is directed by legend Leni Riefenstahl who you actually get to see in the nude at the opening of the film [[ASIN:B000FQJA2S OLYMPIA -The LENI RIEFENSTAHL Archival Collection]].    Day 1 - Landing at Nuremburg to the Day 1 Night Rally  Day 2 - Luitpold Arena Opening Ceremony to the torchlight SA Parade  Day 3 - Hitler Youth Rally to Hitler Night Speech  Day 4 - SA at the World War I memorial to Hitler's final speech    The real find on this DVD is the film \\"The Secret Life of Adolf Hitler\\" which is given as an extra.  Honestly, as a lover of history and propaganda, this may be worth the purchase on its own.  This film actually contains footage shot by Hitler's love, Eva Braun as well as soldiers of the Nazi German Army.  Imagine seeing this piece of history unfold through the eyes of these crazies.  You also get to see footage of Hitler's sister Paula Wolfe who supposedly was put in a mental institution under the 3rd Reich's policy and eventually put to death...WOW
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I had heard some Kings of Leon songs on the radio and decided to get this record based on the reviews and the press they have received.    Listening to the record shows that it is all well deserved.  Solid songs that are both catchy and interesting at the same time.    Too often I have bought records based on hearing a song or two and a \\"buzz\\", and the records do not stand up.  This one does and I will have to go back and get some of their other CDs.
B00005JM1F|5.0|I know several persons in their early 30's that will tell you that this movie is closer to a true story than you think...A midlife traumatic break up mixed with lots of partying and little self-control.    Once again a movie with one of my favorite people, Will Ferrell. He has a way of stealing every scene that he is in, and this movie is no different. Together with mr \\"i talk all the time\\" Vince Vaughn and \\"i look insecure no matter what\\" Luke Wilson they are a very good comedic gang. I watched the unrated edition on dvd and of course they have tried to put as many pairs of breasts they can get away with :) But this is a simple and funny movie. Will Ferrel goes streaking through the city, Sean William Scott does a small role as an abusive animal trainer and Snoop does a cameo. All in all i think people will enjoy this movie. Although it is not exceptionally good, it is good enough to have a few laughs and enjoy yourself.
B00008NRLO|2.0|The film begins with scenes that suggest the 19th century. &#34;No one escapes his destiny.&#34; Knock, the house agent, reads a strange letter from Count Orlok of Transylvania and sends his agent Thomas Kutter to finish the deal. [Do the actors seem weird?] The name of Count Orlok surprises and scares the people at the inn. A strange animal is outside (a striped hyena). Kutter goes to Orlok's castle; the sun is setting. Kutter awakes the next morning to find his meal. He has two bites on his neck, the mosquitoes are terrible there. Kutter learns the secret but is trapped until he can escape. Knock the house agent has gone mad: flies and spiders!   Ellen awaits the return of Thomas. A ship sails the Baltic Sea. One sailor falls sick, then others. The captain is last to go. What is the matter with Ellen? Count Orlok arrives in Wisburg to inhabit that house. That ship lands with no living soul aboard. Is it the plague? This results in many deaths. A mob chases Knock, blaming him for the plague. What will Ellen do to rid Wisburg of the plague? Will Orlok make the mistake of tardying before departing? Will Ellen be saved? The plague ends as suddenly as it started.   The creators of this film were sued for violating the copyright of Bram Stoker's &#34;Dracula&#34;. They changed the names but this story tracks &#34;Dracula&#34;. This appears to be a low budget film. Setting this story in the 19th century seems more credible than the 20th century. The fall in 1921 for agricultural prices was worldwide. Does a recession create a market for horror pictures? The 1932 Hollywood film &#34;Dracula&#34; remains the classic version of this story. [Were the ears of &#34;Mister Spock&#34; copied from Orlok?] Horror stories like these died out after victory in WW II and the prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s. Horror films then were based on &#34;science&#34; (like giant ants or invaders from space). Will more horror films be produced in the current recession? One consolation is that horror films will never become a TV series.   In this and other films the bite of a vampire is shown as two small punctures about 3 cm apart. That represents a small mouth like a snake or small animal. How much blood could be extracted that way? Would there be enough calories? If not, that is proof for the non-existence of vampires.
B0006IJ5PM|5.0|It certainly started out as just another football film (though over-directed with a hyper-active camera)...the parties, the sexual shenanigans, the over-the-top characters. I was ready to pan the film.  But then it heated up. Once the season started, and the football action became the centerpiece, this film shined. The characters were compelling and you really felt for them and their individual situations.    I am not a Billy Bob Thorton fan, but I was pleasantly surprised by his controlled performance. Too often the coaches in football movies are completely over the top. Thorton had the strength to get on people - but he never over did it. It was a football coach.  And the movie ended on a strong note. The half-time speech Thorton gives during the final game is something that gives a former football player goose bumps. It really encapsulates what its truly like to be a part of a football TEAM...and how powerful that experience can be.    I have seen movies like \\"All the Right Moves\\", \\"The Program\\", \\"Varsity Blues\\" and the laughable \\"Any Given Sunday\\". NONE of them can hold a candle to this movie. Any football player or fan needs to watch this film...the best football movie I have ever watched.
B001UE276A|4.0|If you're a big fan, you have to buy this. There's no way around it. The books and all the extras on the 4 DVDs are more than enough. The only flaw is that the printing could've been of a higher quality, just as the \\"diploma\\" you get in the box. It somehow makes it look rushed. But in the end, it's still worth collecting.
0671027344|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful. I've never enjoyed reading so much in my life. It was a very sad-happy book, and honestly, i wanted to cry at some parts. But when i finally brought myself to read the end, i no longer felt like crying, i felt happy. The book changed my view-point on life. It showed me that i should stop thinking about everything i think about so much and just do it. Participate in life, as the book says.

Choke leads you on a path that you assume is going somewhere, and although it has many surprises, it fails to make any ultimate point.<br /><br />I'd buy it again.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|If you're expecting the usual pop songs and cliche lyrics that tend to come out of American Idol, then this album will surprise you!     Produced by Rob Cavallo, the album encompasses all sides of Rock, from the anthemic 'Declaration' and 'Heroes', to the softer 'Come back to Me' and 'Lie', to the poigantly personal, introspective 'Permanent', to the metallic crunching 'Bar-ba-sol'.    A strong album full of rich lyrics, strong vocals and catchy tunes, this debut definitely shows David Cook's Star is firmly on the rise!
B001FB4W16|4.0|I am not one for ridiculous essays on products since I am not getting paid (you know who you are)to write an honest review of something I own and have watched. The series is great, good storyline thus far. I like the southern creole vampire feel, kinda Ann Rice, but less gothic and more contemporary. Wish HBO would have longer seasons than 12 episodes and kinda silly that there is only 2 episodes per disc on the blue ray. Never was a fan of HBOs DVD formatting anyway. The quality is good for BD, but there is some digital noise and artifacts you won't get on say the Dark Knight blue ray
B000005JA8|3.0|This is an act I have to confess I'd never heard of until recently. Some people online (maybe only one, in the circles that I move in) have either catergorised this band and/or album as one of the all time greats. Recently I reacquainted myself with a list compiled a few years back by Australian Rolling Stone magazine of 100 \\"must have\\" cds, and this cd made the list. This act also doesn't seem to be played on mainstream FM radio here in Australia either. So, have to say, that I had absolutely no idea what to expect from this album. It's just my curiousity which was piqued by the references to this that I've heard.        Due to the nature of this album, rating it is not easy. I could say that I give it 2.5 out of 5, but with a margin of error of +/- 0.5...meaning that on a bad day I'd give it 2/5 and on a good day, 3/5. That's because it's not really my type of music, though, for people who like jazz or experimental music, this could be a 5/5 album for them.        Some adjectives that could come to mind for people listening to this album might be: avante garde; jazzy; poetic; beat poetry (?); art studenty; English major project; theatre studies major; pretentious; genius; self-consious; waaaay to long; post-modern; radical.       Not really having had much exposure to this kind of music, I can't make any claims as to how original or not this album may be. As a newie to this form of music, it strikes me as perhaps a transpotition of jazz forms to rock, of an avante garde variety.       In some ways, this reminds me of The Beatles' self-title album. That album had an enjoyable avante garde composition in \\"Revolution #9\\", but, mainly, both albums think that they deserve to LPs worth of material. For me, in both cases, I think that both albums could have culled loads of tracks and not suffered for it. \\"Trout mask replica\\" comes in at around 80 minutes of playing time, so you have to make a commitment to listen to it...you can't really play it all in a short burst.As for the style of music, I'd say that this album is like the olympics...something you do once every four years. People into more avante garde music would, of course, desire to play this way more often than me. Lovers of pop/rock might not appreciate the lyrics, which do not come in verse, chorus, verse form.        Now, to the kind of music, instruments, lyrics you hear in this album:  electric guitars, accoustic guitars, saxophone, bass guitar and brass instruments of some description. My guess is that a lot of the music could be described as \\"jazz\\", though the odd song does sound like blues, or folk/country music. The jazz style tracks can be of the discordant kind, but other times it is of the more regulated variety. If you've heard The Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \\"Around the world\\", specifically the introduction to that, you can sort of imagine what kind of discordant sounds this album may have. A few of the tracks are instrumentals, which I suppose I can sort of appreciate on a jazz level, even though I am not a big fan of that genre. Lyrically, the songs can be absurdist type poetry (not sure whether some would count as 'beat' poetry). If you like train of thought lyrics, or the lyrical equivalent of jazz improvisation, you may like this album a lot. The sleeve notes state that there are two singers in this band. One of the voices is a bit throaty-sort of like a middle aged African American singing. The other voice, male also, is less marked. However, you do occasionally get some silly voice effects.        Some of the ways in which album is avante garde include aspects like the song obviously being recorded in increments, and off the cuff, lyrically. Sort of like jazz improvisation...except there is less emphasis on instantaneous improvisation. You will hear false starts, corrections, and ambient noise and conversations.        Okay, I can't really say for any track on this album \\"Oh my God, you MUST hear this!\\". It's not like that. I've made the same point for the only truly jazz album I've reviewed on this site, Miles Davis' \\"Kind of blue\\", to which I gave a similar score for just this very issue. However, of the tracks that I sort of liked, these are the ones that I've made a note on:    Sugar 'n spikes - has some interesting melodies going on in it and the drumming is interesting.    Veteran's day poppy - once this song turns into an instrumental, I don't mind it.     The blimp - on a second listen to this album, I finally put a dot next to this song, albeit in brackets (a dot signifies in my notes that I don't mind the track...a tick next to it means I really like the song). On this track, you can literally say that the singer just phoned in their performance...they did...and that's part of the appeal of this spoken word song. It's an instance of the poetic style working well.     Being facetious, I'll mention the following two songs:    Pena - Marge Simpson sings!    Orange claw hammer: Bob Dylan's unsuccessful attempt at writing a theme song for the tv show \\"The Beverly hillbillies\\"!       Also should mention the song: \\"Dachau blues\\"...I'm not sure if this song is in good taste or not.        Mentioned The Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \\"Around the world\\" a little while back...the first track on this album is what brought that connection up, I mean the song \\"Frownland\\".        For those wondering about the absurd title of this album, the track \\"Old fart at play\\" is the source for it, though the exact phrase is not used in it...but you can piece it together from the context of the lyrics.        So, why would you buy this cd? For something different. It could be useful to would be artists as a way of showing that you can improvise musically, and you don't have to be perfect, or write perfect songs.       Of the albums that I've reviewed, the people who love this Captain Beefheart album might want to check out:    Miles Davis: Kind of blue (described as the jazz album that people who don't like jazz will like).Patti Smith: Horses (emphasis on poetic lyrics and avante garde style)    The moldy peaches: D.I.Y experimental, playful garage (sort of) folk/rock.       Like I said, I don't enough about this genre to pontificate on how important this album is. If this band has been influential, it's not on the kind of bands that you hear on commercial radio, that's for sure!

B000LTAY1U|4.0|First let me say that I really enjoy this watch.  I've had it for about 9 months now and have found that it keeps relatively accurate time.  If you decide not to wear your watch for a couple of days I have found that it gains time quickly after you move it around to rewind it, so make sure you reset the time after the first 15 minutes of wearing.  Also on occasion I have noticed the watch gains time quickly if there is a lot of movement of the watch.  I attended a wedding and after dancing 3 dances I noticed my watch had gained 35 minutes!  Talk about a surprise.      My biggest problem with the watch is the level of water resistance offered.  Now I'm sure I over estimated the amount of resistance offered by the watch.  But after a recent trip down the river my hour hand no longer matches up with my minute hand (ie instead of being halfway between the 9 and 10 at 9:30 it now sits at the 9 o'clock position).  Not a huge problem for some but the problem now has me contemplating the purchase of a new watch.      Overall a great watch to have if you don't get wet often and are aware of the possible time keeping changes after quick moving activities.  Will certainly keep even if I buy a replacement, will be hard to part with.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|I saw it in theaters because it was 100% on rotten tomatoes. People don't lie! It's very refreshing, and kind of random, but Philippe Petit is a random kind of guy. It's a documentary, but watches more like a heist. The music, the homevideos and reinactments, everything, is very well done. Definitely a story to delight many and make you wonder in awe about what kind of people are out there.

B001H5X7JS|4.0|I have to admit I had terribly low expectations for this move, just as I did when my then-sixteen year old daughter dragged me to see \\"George of the Jungle\\" yea these many years ago. I sat down to watch, grimly expecting my intelligence, taste and sense of humor to be insulted for two hours... but contrary to those low initial expectations, both \\"George\\" and \\"Tropic Thunder\\" turned out to be very, very funny movies.<br /><br />The opening sequence to \\"Tropic Thunder\\" - seemingly a series of trailers for the sort of film that I avoid like the plague was hilarious, and all the more pointed for really, really looking like trailers for real films. Apparently it has taken quite a few watchers to realize these trailers were part of \\"Tropic Thunder\\" - the essential set-up for the main plot. Which says something about the current state of Hollywood, and sets the tone for the subsequent two hours of gleeful skewering of war movies like \\"Platoon\\" and \\"Apocalypse Now\\", over-involved method actors who don't drop character until the last commentary is completed on the DVD release, actors who play every damn part in a fat suit, fake Vietnam War vets and the memoirs they write, out-of-control movie spectaculars involving protracted and expensive location shoots and a whole range of directorial pathologies. That the director, Ben Stiller could induce a whole array of fairly well-known actors to go along with him in poking well-aimed fun at everything to do with their profession does argue that Hollywood as a whole has not entirely lost a sense of humor about itself.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, concerns a wildly expensive and over-budget war movie spectacular being shot on location with an all-star cast, a la \\"Apocalypse Now\\". Lurching wildly out of control, the producer and moneybags (a profane, practically unrecognizable and differentially hirsute Tom Cruise) is about to pull the plug. The desperately overwhelmed director connives to drop his stars into a bit of reality - turning them loose in the jungle, and film them at a distance as they complete their impossible mission.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|Martyrs is an exceptionally violent, gory, gruesome and emotionaly charged movie that would leave you searching for answers behind its premise long after it's over.<br /><br />Let's start with this question - what causes one to question the meaning of life? Is it the joy of living, the fear of suffering, or the anxiety caused by the fear of death? I didn't ask these questions before I sat down to watch Martyrs, but I walked away with them.<br /><br />The movie starts with a scene of escape. We witness a seriously hurt girl running out of a very shady warehouse in The-middle-of-nowhere, France. The girl is semi nude, barefoot, very scared and very hurt. Yet it isn't so much the disturbing image she portrays, but her cries of desperation that draw our attention. Just this scene is enough to lock its self into one's mind and cycle in search of its meaning, but the director doesn't allow us the time to think. During the next few minutes, we are exposed to a quick run through years of the girl growing in a home for abandoned children. We see her attempt to make friends with other and her emotional struggles to cope with a secret locked deep in her mind. We can only dares to image what it may be.<br /><br />Then the movie takes a sharp turn into the dark alley of the unexplained. And this is why I'm writing a review for this movie and not for one that bores its viewers with the first 15 minutes. The turn is so sharp that I found myself glued to the screen until its final scene despite the abundance of brutality and violence.<br /><br />Over the next 30 minutes, viewers witness the shocking murders of a four-person family. This is where we meet the girl again except she is now grown up. And rather than seeing her well adjusted in life, we see her carrying a double barrel shotgun blasting away what appeared four innocent people. The director doesn't spare the viewers the ugliness of a murder. One can almost imagine what the students of Columbine must have felt when the two insane individuals blasted their way throughout the school.<br /><br />But there is a reason behind the senseless killings. Later we discover that the mother and father were the torturers from the girl's past. And if viewers can find some justification for the gruesome killings, it soon diminishes as we discover the girl's depth of psychological disturbance. We see her slash her own body and tear at her own skin as if possessed by an unseen forse. Except we can see the force, an image of a twisted human shape (this one worse than the one in The Ring).  At that point the only way the director can bring us back to sanity is through the eyes of the only sane character in the entire movie. A friend arrives at the scense, a compassionate and courageous girl who shines with her devotion to help the lost. Her compassion is contagious, yet devastating as it becomes the leading cause of her own demise.<br /><br />A lot more can be said about this movie, but I'll leave it with this: Martyrs' is unique in that it actually has an encoded meaning in the suffering of its characters. This meaning is partially revealed in the last sentence of the movie, when viewers uncover what remains after death arrives.

B000P12LWY|4.0|Out of all the reigning monarchs of England and elsewhere whose lives would have made a smashingly entertaining soap opera, that of Henry VIII is generally acknowledged to be at the top of anyone's short list. The man certainly had a way with serial monogamy, and as such has kept writers like Philippa Gregory, movie-makers, playwrights and the BBC busy for decades. Make that centuries, for even Shakespeare had a go. One would think there isn't another blessed thing that could be said about the much-married monarch, and yet Showtime has managed it. And they haven't even gotten up to the point where he had finally and irrevocable divested himself of his first wife and married the second - in the process almost casually wrenching England out of the orbit of the Catholic Church. This season just sets the stage and establishes the personalities.<br /><br />In one way, this reminded me rather vividly of the movie \\"Elizabeth\\", in that it combined psychological acuity with considerable historical inaccuracy. Yes, there are all sorts of inaccuracies, merged events, death of historical personages that did not occur for years after the events depicted here, deaths that did not in the least happen as represented here, and strikingly divergent  visualizations of personalities - not least of which is Henry himself.<br /><br /> This is not the usual Henry VIII, a heavy-set and peevish middle-aged man; here he is vital, young and passionate; a sort of rock-star king, as charming as he is - perhaps - a sociopath. He is the sun around which the whole of his court and government revolve. Jonathan Rhys Meyers looks nothing like the historical Henry. However, he conveys the arrogant attraction of the man and his single-minded pursuit of his desires, whether it was victory on the tilt-yard or in a diplomatic convocation... or to be rid of a wife who could not bear him a son. One has the sense that yes, Henry VIII was probably very much like this; charming, mercurial and dangerous to cross - and that his court was a snake pit of seething ambitions and relentless plotting to gain his ear and his favor.<br /><br />Eventually Henry would be also be rid of anyone around him who dared to tell him \\"no\\", and that is what is the larger drama in this first season: the downfall and disgrace of his most trusted adviser and chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey (Sam Neill) and the setting aside of his proud and able wife, the Catholic Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) in favor of the younger and presumably fruitful (and Protestant) Anne Boleyn. This is the point which has been reached in the series finale, although for my money, the most noteworthy climax was that moment of quiet horror when Thomas More (Jeremy Northam) and another councilor seemed to realize that there was absolutely no one left at court who would be able to reason or coax Henry out of the disastrous course that he had set.<br /><br />Of the extra features included in this set, the most interesting is a look at series production and sets, and a tour of modern-day sites in London associated with Henry VIII's court.court was a snake pit of seething ambitions and relentless plotting to gain his ear and his favor.

1415743762|4.0|Everyone has a guilty pleasure in their life, something that completely counters their alleged public tastes or persona, a taste or an activity which they might have a great deal of trouble admitting they indulge. Consider the health fanatic who secretly indulges in the occasional quart of Ben and Jerry's, the gourmet cook with a liking for chicken Mcnuggets, the litt&eacute;rateur who curls up with a good trashy Jacqueline Suzann novel. I write carefully researched historical novels, and take such care with the authenticity of them, that the pleasure of watching movies and television set in the same era and place that I specialize in is usually completely and comprehensively ruined, for I am taking note of every little anachronism or error.  But the Tudors - over the top, flashy, trashy and cheerfully, unashamedly inauthentic as to every category of historical detail - is my guilty pleasure. Yes, I know that all sorts of liberties have been taken with details of the lives of various prominent people at the court of Henry VIII, to the point where reviewers of the Tudors Season One are reduced to incoherent gibbering, and ordinarily I would be gibbering right along with them. But... the Tudors are still my guilty pleasure, and I think there may be two reasons for that. First - because the series dares to re-imagine a very familiar and of-told story, a story which was so complicated, which so well mingled the personal and political, and had such far-reaching effects. Secondly, it is authentic on a psychological level. Henry VIII was once young, dynamic and dangerously attractive, not the peevish middle-aged man in the usual more authentic visioning of his travails and wives. As played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, he is the central sun around which his administration and his court - more or less the same body of characters - revolve. Single-minded, absolutely determined to have his way in matters small and large, he is seen as rather a rock-star king. This may be very close to how he actually was in life, and his court just that scorpion-pit of conflicting and deadly ambitions. Because this is an extended series, there is space to examine some of the secondary threads and characters; in season one, it was the musician Thomas Tallis. In season 2 it is the character of Thomas More (Jeremy Northam), not quite the saint, but rather the lawyer and bureaucrat, increasingly disturbed by how matters are spinning out of control, deeply troubled by his inability to do anything about it or make the king listen to reason. By the end of this season, Henry has rid himself of another wife and has an eye on a third - and almost as an afterthought, separated the Church of England from the authority of the Pope in Rome.<br /><br />Oddly enough, only two of the features on this set have anything to do with the actual series: a tour of the Tower, and a short feature on various descendants of Henry VIII. All the rest are promotions and episodes of completely different series. All very interesting in their own right, but may leave anyone who wants to know more about the Tudors, or the making of this series feeling a little short-changed.ow he actually was in life, and his court just that scorpion-pit of conflicting and deadly ambitions.

B001PKHS68|5.0|Another Paramount classic, given the lavish \\"Centennial Collection\\" treatment - Cary Grant at the height of his powers as the suave and debonair reformed jewel-thief, once known as \\"The Cat\\",  Alfred Hitchcock at the height of his own directorial powers, Grace Kelly in her last big-screen role as the willful heiress ... and the French Riviera in all of it's mid-century glory. Tiny villages with weathered tile roofs cling to the mountain ridges, classical villas with formal gardens overlook the distant blue Mediterranean, and in the casinos and grand hotels of Nice and Cannes, the wealthy amuse themselves with gambling and displaying their wealth - including lavish jewels.  As the story begins, an extremely agile and daring burglar is harvesting said jewels, and the suspicions of those on both sides of the law fall upon one John Robie, an American expatriate, reformed jewel thief and local hero of the French Resistance. Robie, who has been granted a conditional parole for his burglarious activities on account of his wartime heroism, realizes that his only chance of remaining out of jail and to clear his own name ... is to catch the real thief. So he strikes a deal with a representative of the insurance company - he'll use his own skills to track down and catch the thief. In the process of this, he encounters Frances Stevens, who is more than a little titillated to think that Robie might actually be a jewel thief. And so it goes, the two of them striking provocative sparks off each other, as the plot turns and twists upon itself, just as one of those twisting roads along the coastal cliffs twists and turns, climbing higher.  Ironic indeed, watching Grace Kelly as Frances, try and shake Robie's nerve by driving fast and reckless on one of those roads, knowing that she would die after an auto accident on a similar road, decades later.<br /><br />The movie itself has aged very well - the Riviera locations and the palette of colors are still striking, although the use of rear-screen projections for the scenes in which the actors are traveling in a motor vehicle is very obvious, and looks even more contrived now than it did fifty years ago. Of the extra features included, the stand-out is a long feature on the movie production code which existed at the time \\"To Catch a Thief\\" was written, produced and filmed. This feature dealt amusingly with all the constraints imposed on the director and the studios, and the stratagems employed to get around them and still tell the story, with a wink and a nod.een projections for the scenes in which the actors are traveling in a motor vehicle is very obvious, and looks even more contrived now than it did fifty years ago.

B001N26GFM|4.0|This movie is a vivid, meticulously observed and detailed attempt to imagine the unthinkable, to see the unimaginable - through the eyes of a child, a lively and outgoing little boy named Bruno. Bruno is the youngest member of a loving and affectionate family; he has an older sister who is at that age of being on the cusp between playing with her vast collection of dolls and her first teenage crush. Their father is a professional soldier, rising up in the ranks, who has a prestigious new assignment which will take them far from the city, and their mother, a beautiful socialite - who obviously cherishes her children, nonetheless.  It is a small world, the world of a child - delineated by the streets between a home and school, playmates and parents, the grandparents - a gruff and bluff Grandfather, and the queenly grandmother with sharp eyes and an even sharper tongue. Within the space of the first ten minutes, Bruno and his family are wrenched away from everything familiar and dear, when his father is sent off to a new assignment - away from a comfortable and stately old house in the city to a new and uncomfortably modern one, away out in the country.<br /><br />Of course, it is instantly plain to everyone above the awareness of a mollusk that Bruno's father is an SS officer in Nazi Germany, and that the new assignment is at a concentration camp ... and that the uncomfortably modern villa - so far away from everyone and everywhere, and staffed by slave labor - is on the periphery of the camp, where Bruno's father is in charge. The viewer knows this, simultaneously seeing and knowing, and yet seeing it filtered through Bruno's awareness, that bright and lonely small boy looking for someone to play with. In spite of his parents' efforts to keep him out of the back garden and woods which lead down to the periphery fence around the camp, Bruno does find a friend, another bright and lonely small boy, a Jewish prisoner named Shemuel. They play checkers through the fence, strike up an unlikely friendship. Bruno brings him food - and childlike, never gets around to wondering why Shemuel is constantly hungry.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted that both Bruno, and especially Shemuel seem to be quite terribly - even fatally naïve about a great many matters, not finding it quite credible that both of them would be so clueless about the camp, about Nazi aims for the Jews, about the purpose of the camp itself, especially after the brutality that Shemuel experiences during this movie, and that he would have experienced in being brought to the camp. It might be stretching the bounds of believability, but I recall that I, as  child among other children, lived in our very own world. Nothing bad could ever happen to children, and yet at the same time, we were most amazingly accepting of the most startling circumstances, as long as our parents were present, and calm. Of course we were safe, Mummy and Dad were there and they said so. Remembering this, I can accept that Bruno would go to Shemuel's aid within the camp - Shemuel was his friend, and Bruno felt guilty for having let him down, once.  And so this movie ends, on an abrupt and brutal note. Although it is about children, it is not a movie for children of the age that the protagonists are.<br />Of the extras, there is the usual \\"Making of\\" feature, and a selection of deleted scenes - about half of which, in my opinion, would have been very well included in the feature itself.p an unlikely friendship.

B000XUOIQ4|4.0|It's all about the voices... and something of the animation, in this gentle story of a much-loved mother cat and her three charming kittens in 1910 Paris. Pampered by their elderly mistress who intends to leave her entire estate to them, they find themselves drugged and abandoned in the countryside by Edgar the wicked butler - who wants the whole estate for himself. But since this is a Disney movie, the perils are well - not very perilous at all, as Duchess and her kittens are taken in hand by the roguishly handsome and good-guy-in--spite-of-himself Thomas O'Malley, the Alley Cat. Only a little diverted along the way by a pair of wandering British geese, and a rollicking good time with a swinging alley-cat band, the `aristocats' return home... but Edgar the wicked butler is still there. Thanks to their mouse friend, Roquefort and O'Malley's alley cat friends - and the last-minute aid of a horse with a very neat sense of timing (not to mention good aim!) Edgar is banished, and it all ends on as happy a note  as Disney movies ever did.<br /><br />Released in 1970 it marks the end of an era, being the very last feature personally supervised by Walt Disney. It was also Maurice Chevalier's very last vocal performance, according to an interview feature with the Sherman brothers, included among the extras. All things considered, it has worn very well. It is one of those small mysteries though - how Eva Gabor could be such a mediocre actress in live action, but do such touching and personable voice work as Duchess. The characters of the country dogs, Lafayette and Napoleon (voiced by Pat Buttram and George Lindsey) and their complicated pursuit of Edgar and his motor-bike sidecar was also unexpectedly diverting and hilarious. But what was a pair of southern good old boy hound-dogs doing in 1910 France? Probably the same thing that a mid-20th century feline jazz band was doing; this is a Disney movie, after all.<br /><br />Extras include interviews with the Sherman brothers about the music, and a restored sequence of a song that was not used in the final cut. For my money, the best extras were a very witty and artistically accomplished excerpt from Disney's \\"The Great Cat Family\\" and an entire short Minnie Mouse and Figaro featurette \\"Bath Day.\\"and a restored sequence of a song that was not used in the final cut.

B001V7YWTQ|4.0|Great sound, terrific song selection, excellent musicianship - this CD is a testament that these two rock icons still have a lot of fire left in them. Better than any live Clapton since The Rainbow Concert, Better than any live Winwood recording since Welcome To The Canteen.  Highly Recommended!
B001LMU1JG|5.0|Top Secret is one of my guilty movie pleasures, for the non-stop way in which it throws every imaginable gag at the viewer - sight gags, puns, political humor, slapstick, musical parody, movie parody, classical ballet parody, Omar Sharif in a crunched-up car, an underwater saloon brawl to the tune of the theme for Bonanza, the surreal `backwards' scene in a Swedish bookstore (with subtitles, yet)  and a member of the French Underground named D&eacute;j&agrave; vu (`ave we not met before?\\") . These elements all come flying so thick and fast that at least some of them have a chance to stick to your funny bone. Top Secret cheerfully managed to skewer two apparently disparate genres; the `Cold War/WWII espionage flick, and Elvis Presley musicals, with some passing swipes at \\"Blue Lagoon\\" and various James Bond flicks. Frankly, it doesn't much matter of one gag falls a little flat, for there will be five or six more in the next few seconds, and the odds are that at least one of them will elicit uncontrollable giggles. \\"Top Secret\\" may have been Val Kilmer's very best movie performance, along with \\"Real Genius\\" - and it also proved without a doubt that if he couldn't have made it as an actor, he had a better than even chance as a pop-singer. Alas, within a couple of years he would start taking himself all too seriously. No movie role that he has had since has displayed quite as much of the manic sense of energy, the musical chops - or the gleeful sense of humor.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the most memorable and funniest films from the 1980s, amusingly repackaged with a bonus CD of pop songs from that period: INXS, A-ha, and the barely-recalled Echo and the Bunnymen. Extra features for the film itself include four alternate scenes, the original theatrical trailer and the obligatory commentary track by the directors, and producer.
B001UREJWM|3.0|Ronnie James Dio at age 66+ still has growl & snarl.  Age has taken some edge off.  But sweeter \\"singing\\" passages still show his command of voice as an instrument.  Tony Iommi as always springs some intricate phrasing into signature Sabbath sledgehammer chords.  Geezer fits in with Tony's style and always has.  But drummer Vinny Appice has little presence; seems like he's thrown in just to do a job.  His timing misses & he has no pizzaz.  Only two tunes stand out: Bible Black and Double The Pain.  If Bible Black were a poem with no music, it would still be fascinating.  When I think I have it figured out, I see another veiled reference or subtle metaphor showing more depth.  Great lyric writing.  Double the Pain, while not so good as literature, is driven hard like the Sabbath we know & love.  The rest of the tunes are just so-so.  Maybe if they'd worked on it a bit longer, other songs would have jelled into better quality.  Only three stars, but I bought it, and I'll certainly keep it.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|If there is some kind of contest on for the Walt Disney movie which least resembles the supposed source material, \\"The Jungle Book\\" must be the clear winner. It bears only the lightest and most coincidental resemblance to Rudyard Kiplings's cycle of stories about a little boy raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. Only the setting and the names of characters are preserved. That said, \\"The Jungle Book\\" deserves to be considered on its' own terms as a classically animated Disney feature,  the very last to have been blessed by the hand of Walt himself. The plot is as thin as a wisp; the journey of the boy Mowgli to the village of his own kind, interspersed with some good-natured musical numbers, and helped or hindered by a variety of genial animals, and not terribly threatening villains.<br /><br />It is a curious jumble, to watch with eyes accustomed to more recent animated features like \\"Shrek\\" and \\"Toy Story\\". Without exception the backgrounds are beautifully rendered, densely detailed, almost painterly. The animal characters were fully-fleshed, and with the exception of Kaaa, the python, seemed to move and flex like their real counterparts; especially King Louie the baboon, Bagheera the panther and Sher Khan the tiger. The last two seemed especially slinky; it would be nice to know if the artists responsible for their rendering had cats. King Louie is hilarious, and so are the four vultures - very obviously patterned after the Beatles.  In contrast, the rendering of Mowgli the boy and ostensible hero, looks like a bland and sketchily rendered cut-out. It almost seems as if the artists were far more interested in the animals.<br /><br />The extra features included are generous; this is veritably the platinum standard for a DVD classic. It is on  two discs; necessary to contain the complete movie and commentary. There is also a nearly hour-long feature about how the movie was developed, along with several shorter features. One of the bonus features is a look at a character \\"Rocky the Rhino\\" who was eventually omitted - rather a pity actually, since Rocky  would have been voiced by the man who did \\"Crazy Guggenheim\\". There are also complete recordings of songs which were dropped from the final version, and probably a good call. There are also generous picture galleries of the characters and of the background art, which was purely my favorite, and a series of games. The actual movie itself takes barely more than an hour itself, but the extras will keep an audience amused for days.e Rhino\\" who was eventually omitted - rather a pity actually, since Rocky  would have been voiced by the man who did \\"Crazy Guggenheim\\".

B001EOQWEO|5.0|Of all the references that come to mind with the phrase \\"robot love\\" Wall-E must be about the most cheerfully innocent  - as well as being the most inarticulate for the first half hour or so. Laboring tirelessly away for seven hundred years among the ruins of some unnamed Earth city,  compacting endless mounds of trash into neat cubes and stacking them up in orderly rows, Wall-E is hard-working, but creative and after a long exile with no other companion but a cheerful little cockroach - about to fall in love with his robotic Eve. Who really is named EVE - a sleek white survey `droid, come venturing back to earth to see if it has become fit for humans to return from centuries-long exile on a luxury space ship run almost completely-run by robots. Computer animation allows the `look' of Wall-E to be as visually rich as any three classic Disney efforts put together - the piles of junk on earth  are all individual, and detailed to the nth degree. Wall-E is as endearing and sympathetic a character as has ever been made from a mechanical object, shyly courting the object of his affections and following her back into space and defeating the machinations - literally machinations - of  the robotic first mate of said luxury space ship. Because EVE is bearing a secret with her... but that would give away the plot, such as it is.<br /><br />One of the most creative aspects about this release comes at the very first; the packaging of the set itself; entirely in light card-stock, which admittedly may not wear very well - but it has the holders for the three discs slide out in panels from each side - a very clever and retro space age in design, as well as being ecologically sensitive. The persistence of garbage is one of the points of this movie.<br /><br />The extras are generous, including a whole additional disc with the movie in digital version. Of the expected extras, the most amusing (and cringe-inducing) are the shorts about the inner workings of the Buy n Large Corporation, and the `bot files - all about the various service robots who do the work that humans have apparently moved beyond doing. (They have moved beyond anything except being zipped around on something that resembles an animated barca-lounger, and expanded accordingly.) One interesting feature was about how the robots were designed; apparently all kinds of current technology was studied for insights into how to make Wall-E convincing and believable.<br /><br />This being Pixar,  the outstanding extra short  \\"Burn-E\\" - about a continually frustrated maintenance robot - is right up there with the space aliens in \\"Lifted\\".iles - all about the various service robots who do the work that humans have apparently moved beyond doing.

If ever this book is made into a movie, I will boycott it and Pickett it!     I borrowed the book from the local Library.

This one is not deep or preachy. It pokes fun at the game of wyst and of lace and proper manners while still realizing that this is part of the romance of Jane Austen. This one stays true to Jane Austen's morals without the bad language and sex thrown into a lot of of them nowadays. A lot of authors are jumping on the Jane Austen fan Frenzy with books such as \\"Confessions of a Jane Austen Addict\\", \\"What Would Jane Austen Do?\\" and many others.

0316017922|4.0|Follow-up books can be tough. Like movie sequels, you can end up with a \\"Grease 2\\" or \\"Caddyshack II\\" at one end of the spectrum, to the \\"Godfather\\" series on the other. Happily, Outliers is closer to the good end of the spectrum, and in many ways, I enjoyed it more than \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink\\".    First, let me admit that I'm a sucker for statistical analysis applied to human behavior. I am also well aware that some serious errors can be made by too closely correlating statistics to behaviour in a cause/effect relationship. Having said that, I think there is a lot of truth and insight in this book, and even more than that it's an enjoyable read.    The sections and insights into the Korean Airline disasters, lifelong analysis of the highest IQ students and the opportunities afforded by birthdate are really fun to read and to speculate upon. For me,that's an important point. The science and research underpinnings of the book may not be the most rigorous or exhaustive, but that's not the point. This is a work of popular psychology, not an academic treatise. If you are stimulated to read further on the topics introduced, go ahead. But first, let's have some fun.     The book IS a little short on conclusions, which is ok by me. I'd rather draw my own. For what it's worth here's my takeaway:    You too can be an outlier is you have some skills and are willing to work really, really hard: Like practice for about 10,000 hours.    You can avoid being a \\"disaster\\" outlier by engaging in \\"best practices\\" in communication.    You can become an outlier through a combination of being \\"intelligent enough\\" \\"street smart\\", a good communicator, and by practicing you craft. Other people may have advantages over you because of when they were born, who they were born to or where they were from, but you can compensate.    Not terribly profound, but maybe that's what makes a great work of popular psychology. It helps us understand what makes common sense so uncommon.

0375713751|1.0|Allison Pearson should try another line of work, because she is not good at being a novelist.  This is absolutely aweful writing.  The \\"idea\\" of the book is brilliant, but the execution is...well...excrutiating.  It was so hard to get past the first chapter.  Ms. Pearson is too descriptive in her efforts to get us \\"into\\" the book.  Most of us who are reading this book are already \\"into\\" the subject~~we are stay at home moms, we are working moms, we are busy moms.  We LIVE the idea of this book.  We would be able to immerse ourselves into a book like this if it weren't muddled with soooo much wording.  Ms. Pearson takes 50 words to describe what she could have in 10, and takes 338 pages to tell a tale that could have taken 200 or less.  This was an agonizing read, I would not recommend it, and while parts of it relate to those of us moms living it, it would take you more effort to read it than it would to actually get through the experiences she is trying to relate to us.  Do not bother with this aweful book.

B001HAQB9G|5.0|Doidge helps to bring together \\"edge\\" findings in science that, when given appropriate perspective, lead us to realize we're at a new threshhold of being able to understand and control our physical and mental experience of the world.  Doidge evaluates new findings and experiments in areas such as learning disabilities, phantom limb pain, and stroke recovery, to support the common findings that the brain is an adaptive mechanism that can be understood, and often corrected when things go wrong.  I want to start this book over when I finish to get all the details, decide what source material to pursue further, and consider the further implication of these findings.  Many fields of medicine lend themselves to \\"remapping the brain\\" consideration -- addiction, autoimmune disorder, post traumatic stress and phobias, clinical depression,etc. can all be seen as the brain/nervous system learning maladaptively.

B000025O03|5.0|When I first heard Stain (I got it in a CD shop at The World Trade Center the day it came out,) I fell in love with Living Color. I had Vivid and Time's Up, the band's fantatic first two records that showed everything they could do. But I was almost overwhelmed by the heavyness of the music in what was then reletively new digital production.<br /><br />Stain is tighter, funkier, and meaner. The bass player on the first two albums, Muzz Shillings, was replaced by  session pro Doug Wambush, and he gave a chunkier, more popping bottom to Living Color's music. You can hear this on tracks like \\"Go Away,\\" and \\"Auslander\\" At the same time, Living Color was making the chord structures more dissonent, and the hard rock harder. and so the band was maturing in its sound as it expanded, simultainiously, in two differant directions. They were also widening their dynamic palate: listen to the pulsating electronics that run through \\"Auslander\\" You would think these would be garish on a nuts-out hard rock album, but like any master musicians, the band makes it work like a charm.<br /><br />If I were getting into Living Color now, I would probably start with Stain and work backwards. This album converted me fully to this band, and my tounge was hanging out wondering where they would go next.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they broke up--not part of my plan-but at least they left me with this.<br /><br />Living Color may have made more diverse records than Stain, but never made a better one.

0375842209|5.0|In my family, I'm famous for reading the spoilers for movies and even occasionally some books . In a moment of suspense at whatever movie we might be attending, my husband can always turn to me when the tension gets to be just too much and ask me how things are going to turn out because he knows that I've read the spoiler. Why would I do this you might ask? To protect myself from caring too much. My theory has always been that if I know things are going to turn out badly I won't get too attached to the characters.    Imagine my surprise when The Book Thief destroyed all of my carefully laid plans. Since the book, which takes place in Nazi Germany, is narrated by Death it isn't giving away too much to say that I knew things couldn't possibly turn out happily for Liesel Meminger, the book thief. Death himself even gives us very broad and specific hints at what lies in store for Liesel, and those she cares about throughout the book. Despite all this, I fell hard for almost each and every character in this book. I actually found myself wiping away a few tears as I finished the last few pages. I've been reading a lot of great books lately, but this one really stands out as an amazing read.    The story is that of Liesel Meminger, a young German girl who we meet just prior to the rise of power of the Nazi party. Liesel is sent to live with some foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, who live on Himmel street, just outside of Munich. Liesel has lost everything; and is haunted especially by the death of her brother which she witnessed. Somehow, she finds comfort in words and books, despite her inability to read. Hans, her amazing foster father, teaches her to read. This love of books, especially stolen ones, becomes Liesel's salvation, and her means of survival as her nation goes up in flames.    I honestly can't say too many wonderful things about this book. I honestly loved everything about it. The characters are so wonderful, so amazing, so imperfectly human, and the story will inspire you and break your heart all at the same time.

The first books were truly entrancing, so well written and moving, exciting page turners.  Right now I feel like I've been slimed by weird lifestyle propaganda and I live in CALIFORNIA.    Stephanie Meyer, maybe you should have studied Harry Potter instead of Wuthering Heights.  You really missed the chance to take proper care of your readers.
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|\\"Midnight Express\\" was nominated for 7 Academy Awards in 1978, winning for Best Music, Best Original Score, and Best Writing for Material Adapted From Another Medium for Oliver Stone. Brad Davis stars as Billy Hayes in this true story of a young man who is arrested in Instanbul, Turkey for trying to smuggle hashish out of the country. What follows are five harrowing, hellish years for Billy as he tries to survive living in a foreign prison, in a country he knows little about, and with people who seem at times unhuman. Billy ultimately has a nervous breakdown and he is sentenced to time in the psychiatric unit of the prison.<br /> In the late 1990's both Oliver Stone and Billy Hayes stated they were sorry for the film's depiction of Turkish people, as not a single Turk was dramaitized as compassionate. The film has gone on to be hated by the people of Turkey for it's narrow-minded view on a foreign country and its people. Nevertheless, \\"Midnight Express\\" is an excellent film, one you will watch time and time again for its graphic depiction of prison life and the attempts of those who are imprisoned in trying to survive. \\"Midnight Express\\" is prison slang for inmates who want to attempt escaping, thus that is where the title is derived from.<br /> The movie has an excellent cast including Bo Hopkins, Randy Quaid, and John Hurt. Brad Davis is mesmerizing as the young Billy and he should have received an Oscar nod for Best Actor but was overlooked. Maureen McCormick from TV's \\"The Brady Bunch\\" was considered for the small part of Billy's girlfriend, but the role was cast with another actress.<br /> This new anniversary edition of \\"Midnight Express\\" includes the film in widescreen format, which is beautifully restored, a director's commentary by Alan Parker, photo gallery, and a producer's featurette. Brad Davis' widow has written a fascinating book on Brad called \\"After Midnight\\" which features some great information on the movie. This book came out after Brad died of assisted suicide in 1991. Brad Davis was diagnosed with AIDS.<br /> If you enjoy this movie three other prison films are worth watching: \\"Ecsape from Alcatraz\\", \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", and \\"The Green Mile\\" are near the caliber of \\"Midnight Express\\".icide in 1991.

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Here's a movie for dog lovers, the elderly, children of divorce, FOBs (Friends of Birds), former Boy Scouts, people yearning for adventure, and anyone who has ever loved... and lost. Up is for everyone. It made me laugh out loud, and it made me cry.<br /><br />I thought it would be tough for Up to match the emotional power of [[ASIN:B001EOQWEO Wall-E]]. The two Pixar films are similar in their lack of dialogue in the first act, which helps deepen the emotional impact. Up begins with Carl, a shy young boy star-struck by a famous explorer; and kookie Ellie, who has a similar obsession. The two kids become fast friends, and vow to one day travel to Venezuela. After getting married, they buy their dream home and fix it up, hoping to fill it with children. Carl and Ellie's life together from childhood through old age is depicted, silently, with delicacy and subtlety. These first 15 minutes is like a celebration of a happy marriage, and you truly feel Carl's pain when he is left alone. He sits slumped in his chair, talking to the house as if it is the missing Ellie.<br /><br />When developers close in on Carl's beloved home, he decides to fulfill his promise to Ellie and travel to Paradise Falls. A former balloon vendor, Carl lifts his home with hundreds of colorful balloons. Stowing away on the porch is Russell, a plump, plucky kid trying to earn a scouting badge.<br /><br />Later, man and boy are joined by a golden retriever who can talk with his collar, and a huge, colorful bird. Dug the dog is priceless: spot-on for every dog that ever lived, including his obsession with squirrels. Through a series of close calls and adventures, the quartet vanquishes a villain and saves the day. And Russell earns his scouting badge.<br /><br />In the process, Carl learns to let go of his mourning for Ellie, and live life again. When this happens, a magical thing happens. Before, Carl's craggy face is gray and monochromatic. At the moment of his transformation, Carl's face is awash in color, and he is surrounded by beautiful hues. It reminded me of [[ASIN:B000Q66J1W The Wizard of Oz]], when Dorothy steps out of her gray world and into a candy-colored Munchkinland. Carl, too, enters a whole new world.<br /><br />Up is an emotional movie, full of truth. It's one of the year's best films. Score another triumph for Pixar.<br /><br />-- By Julie Neal, author of [[ASIN:0970959672 The Complete Walt Disney World 2010]].beautiful hues.

How Come?    I mean unless a second production includes the spanish subtitles for me they are jerks.    ariel
B00005RYLE|4.0|This review is primarily for the Book of the Dead packaging, but I will delve briefly into various presentations of the film.    I originally bought the Book of the Dead version when it was first released by Anchor Bay. The obvious luster of this packaging struck me with excitement as soon as I saw it. At the time I had the Elite version, which I immediately sold to fund the new purchase.    This packaging is awesome. The binding is latex and looks and feels great. The pages inside are thick and contain artwork inspired by the film, as well as a book of liner notes. The dvd itself is in a thin plastic sleve with a soft back for the data side.    Everyone who sees the book on my DVD shelf immediately picks it up and checks it out.    Having said all that, over the years the book is finally starting to show some degeneration. The binding along the top and the sides of the latex have started to tear. The face and back look great, though I'm concerned that the tears will destroy the entire cover.     Considering the book is 9 years old (2002 - 2009) it's had a good life, and should be great for at least a few more. I don't handle it frequently, it simply sits on the shelf with the other DVDs.    In regards to other editions, the newest \\"Ultimate Edition\\" is the best way to go. The packaging is beautiful, with the different covers that have been released previously as separate editions. The special features are great, and it includes the matted as well as the full frame editions.    Personally I have both the Book of the Dead, and the Ultimate editions. The Book of the Dead edition is just too cool to let go.    **Look closely at the cryptic text inside the book**

0393320928|5.0|I read this book, several years ago and I read it even now, selected pages over and over again, when I need a source of inspiration.    Feynmann was one of the first rate scientists, even more, a first rate citizen. Few are lucky to live a life like he did, to have courage to live like he did, and to have the skill to write/express/explore like he did.    He was not only an exceptional scientist, but a gifted teacher who could teach other scientists how to be a scientist of the scientist and engineer of the engineers.    This book (as his almost all books, which I have) is a must read.  An enjoyable journey of insight into his thinking, analysis, questioning attitude and utter honesty.    I am a professor at some university and this book influenced my thinking and approach profoundly to the extent that when I am confronted with teaching and understanding complex scientific stuff, I often wonder how Feynmann would do it, and I try my best to follow his example.    A treasure of candid thoughts and beautiful expositions of life experiences.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Amnesiac being Radiohead's 5th studio album and their 2001 release was a quick follow up to the album Kid A which had been released just one year before. The album was a smash hit in both the UK and peaked their at #1 and also did well on the Billboard 200 peaking at #2. Unlike the prior album which had released no singles this album had three singles released \\"I might be wrong\\", \\"Pyramid song\\" and \\"Knives Out\\". No lyrics are included in the booklet but we get a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5.
B000244FDW|5.0|Elizabeth Garvey and David Rintoul are a marvelous Elizabeth and Darcy. Rintoul is more as I imagine Darcy than Colin Firth is -- stiffer, more formal, and better groomed.     Priscilla Morgan as Mrs. Bennett is wonderful. And appealing! You can see how Mr. Bennett might have fallen for her. Mr. Bennett is rather too austere for me, though.    And Malcolm Rennie as Mr. Collins! I love him! He's exactly what the book says he should be -- large, conceited, pompous -- without making you cringe at being near him. Some Mr. Collinses make you want to wash your hands after watching.    This is a gentler, less boisterous production than the Ehle/Firth one. I'd say Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine (Judy Parfitt) are much better in this one. My husband and I watch both, often, and I think we have almost a skull video going with a combination of actors.

B00005JKTF|4.0|It had a few nice twists and a nice developing love story.  The only thing I didnt like was how sometimes Cate would have a good Scottish accent *like she should for the movie* and sometimes it would just be a plain british accent....  This is when she's \\"speaking english\\" not \\"speaking french\\" because both were in english.  Anyway yeah it was good.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|I tried hard to resist this film. Anything that bombards me with so much incredible press I find suspicious. Example? The Da Vinci code: with everyone and their mother talking to me about it I resisted reading it for months until I finally gave in. The difference between Slumdog Millionaire and the Da Vinci Code? I actually enjoyed Slumdog.     Despite myself I was thoroughly engaged, entertained, and delighted by the film. I still found myself put off by the constant talk about it everywhere-- I mean, comparing this film to such intense dramas such as Milk and The Wrestler?? Come on-- but really, deep down, I definitely enjoyed this movie. It is the epitome of the \\"feel good\\" film. Everything, from the end credits to the cinematography to the acting to the music, spins together to create a great and enjoyable film.     The current controversy surrounding the situation of the child actors in the film really raises awareness to the child poverty issue that is really at the heart of the film. While the film is ultimately \\"feel good\\" it is important not to ignore the whole \\"slum dog\\" topic that is often skirted aside by the uplifting ending.     The idea of this game show being imported to a poverty stricken and turbulent area and changing lives may seem far-fetched to some, but after seeing a preview screening of a documentary called Afghan Star (which focuses on Afghanistan's version of American Idol) the topic is much more believable in my mind. Afghan Star mirrors many of the scenes in Slumdog Millionaire that were often the most interesting, but this time for real-- people in rural villages crowded around small televisions in tiny rural and barren towns, families rigging up antennas to be able to catch the show in time, and a nation that ignores its problems for brief moments to come together and cheer for an underdog to change their lives on a reality show. Because of the real people at the heart of this film I found Afghan Star ultimately more moving and deep, and it also addresses the greater issues at work in the country from the turbulent politics to the social changes at work in the country.     Slumdog Millionaire is still a great feel-good film that really so many people can enjoy and, at the same time, be exposed to another culture along the way!
B00004XONN|4.0|Kid A  being Radiohead's 4th studio album and their 2000 release is a very experimental album that can be called both alternative rock and electronic music. The album met with mixed reviews but was a massive hit in many countries. The album peaked at #1 in the UK chart, Billboard 200, Ireland, Canada, France and in New Zealand. The booklet is very avantgarde and contains no lyrics and many strange paintings. I am very impressed by this album and it is one of the better albums that I have heard for quite some time. 4/5.
0375836675|5.0|After reading THE BOOK THIEF this book was recommended to me.  So different in tone than the first Zusak book I read & yet it was still completely gripping.  I fell in complete love with the characters- their flaws, their triumphs, the beauty in the little things.  The ending was predictible but I saw why he had to go there & I wasn't sad about it.  I would absolutely recommend it- just an amazing book from start to finish.  Everyone should have an Ed Kennedy in their life.  And I think I'd like to have a pint with Markus Zusak if I ever get the chance.
B0009A40ES|5.0|Excellent performance from Christian.  He can do crazy very well.  My favorite scene in the whole movie is when he's shooting at the cops and he blows up one of the cars... He stops for a moment and stares at his gun and gives it a sort of \\"What the hell\\" look.  Perfect, awesome... The second American Psyco is pretty hilarious too... good good.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I own this DVD, and I must say that I watch it at least once every week. This tour covers forty years of Cher who has and continues to live life on her terms and no one elses. This DVD is a must own for everyone! Buy it today!
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|Songs of Mass Destruction  being Lennox 4th studio album and her 2007 release sounds like a generic pop album with quite ordinary lyrics. I agree with Rolling Stones Magazine review of this album but since I can not give 3.5 then I give it 3 out of 5. Songs like \\"Dark Road\\" and \\"Sing\\" are not bad tracks but I have heard this kind of music so many times and it is not my favorite kind of music by far. All the lyrics are included, and we get a list of whom plays what on the album.  3/5.
0375842209|5.0|The most unexpected & beautiful book I read all year.  This book was recommended to me by Amazon.  I clicked to get the sample to my Kindle & could not put it down.  From the perspective that it was narrated by Death & takes place during the Holocaust you might think this book would be horribly depressing, but the characters are so endearing & charming it's tough not to root for them and love them in all of their glory.  While the world crumbles around them, they find love, friendship, and life.  It was hard not to feel uplifted at the end of this book despite the subject matter.  Markus Zusak is truly a wordsmith.  Read it- you won't regret it.
B000YAA68C|5.0|The first time I watched it... I cried for about 87% of the movie.  It was about 5 minutes of crying, 1 minute of not crying through the whole movie.  I watched it a second time and it was about 30% crying...  Very good performances from everyone.
0385341008|4.0|I enjoyed this book on the audio version with a great reader with the perfect accent.  I was also reading a book written about the same time in history, only a different location, so I did notice the same sense of hopelessness at times and glimmers of hope at others.  I liked the development of the characters and I felt like I could feel some of their pain as they described the events of the war on their island.  I also appreciated the fact that there was some actual history, with the fiction characters.

B001P3SA94|4.0|This is such a great movie!  Everyone in it did a fantastic job!  I've seen it three times and it's one to own.  The music is great, and even Beyonce - who comes in about two thirds into the movie - is the best she's ever been. Columbus Short was my favorite. His Little Walter was a trip.  And Howlin' Wolf was scary.  Mos Def was great in his short role of Chuck Berry.  I think it should have been in the theaters much longer and promoted more.  There are so few movies with a black cast that aren't comedies.  And Jeffrey Wright was great as Muddy Waters and Adrian Brody was very believable. My Mom and boyfriend loved it also. And I liked how they told you how they were in the hall of fame and who they sued for using their music.  Buy this movie
0312360266|5.0|I am utterly in love with the house of night series! Although it isn't written as well as twilight, it does have more action and frankly captures the imagination more easily. The twilight saga had a teenage girl who spoke and thought at the age of a woman in her mid-30s, and it was basically about the deep love, there was some action, but not as much as i had hoped for. House of night is literally from the teens perspective. But i loved it!I am totally apart of the nerd herd!
B00005OCMR|5.0|Loved this movie when saw it as a kid.  And it still holds strong even today.  This movie definitely had an influence on the new Matrix movies.  But this is much more family friendly...it's Disney!
037571457X|4.0|I bought the two books for the wedding of my uncle (who was born in Iran). We have already seen the movie which is really good and so well made. The story is simple, effective and also funny. This is the story of many Iranians who had to leave their country because of a stupid regime. I would like to thank Marjan Satrapi to finally give another image of Iran to people who still think that everybody there wears a beard and yells \\"Allah\\" every two seconds. I recommend this book to everybody on Earth, especially to people wearing beards :)
B001SMC91M|4.0|This is a nicely retro Memphis 60's soul record.  The opening track, \\"Gunpowder\\", could not make it any more explicit, borrowing in toto the horn riff from the Bar-Kay's \\"Soul Finger\\", I think I hear echoes of \\"Expressway to Your Heart\\" in the second track \\"Sugarfoot\\", and \\"Master Sold My Baby\\" has a bit of a Bo Diddly feel.    The aforementioned \\"Gunpowder\\" is the standout track, the rest of the album is very competent and listenable, but so far nothing else has really stuck in my memory.  I guess you could think of this as one of the old 60s albums that used to have one hit and 9 competent \\"filler\\" songs. (\\"Get Yo S**t\\" is a bit of a low point with a trite storyline and too much talking).    First get the originals (like the Stax Box sets), then if you liked those, get this \\"keeping the flame alive\\" CD.
B000002UJQ|4.0|\\"This album must be the greatest, because everybody says it is\\"...\\"it must be profound because it is ambiguous\\"...I think the point is that every generation/decade needs its own heroes, not recycled ones from past generations. And plenty of past talents don't measure up to their hype (Sinatra, Dylan, etc). EVERY british/american pop/rock band since the 1960's watershed has been derivative, trying to resurrect the cultural youth phenomenon of that era (or at least it's marketing potential) while trying to make a fresh statement, and largely failing because cultural phenomena can't be manufactured and youth culture has been particularly adrift since then. And just how do you emulate an era while simultaneously trying to bury it?     So how do they rate the #1 spot on \\"best ever\\" lists? Does Radiohead really have more to say than any other band since 1960, or do they say it better? Maybe they deserve respect for sheer hard work and determination through years of hated touring and recording, and still coming up with sensitive, interesting, fresh and energetic albums? Maybe they are the best middle-ground between 90's thrash/grunge instrumentals and intel/emo lyrics and vocals? Maybe they deserve a \\"retrospective achievement\\" award for those who survive cultural trendshifting with the most grace, skill and sensitivity in evidence? For all of the above reasons, maybe they deserve that. However, modern musicians should no longer be on comparison lists with decrepit 1960's bands, because those times and the worldview they reflected are increasingly irrelevant and overdue for retirement, some might say long overdue.     In the deepest analysis, American/British popular \\"youth\\" culture is a self-important and self-absorbed fantasy, based more in commerce than meaning, and blind to the greater global cultural reality.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Oh man, this is my second day doing 30-day shred and I'm still only at the ten minute mark on the DVD. This is a butt kicking workout, like everyone says, and today I could feel my first workout from yesterday, all day. It's a really amazing workout, I can't believe I can't even make it past ten minutes! Be careful, you don't even have time to get a drink of water with this DVD so be prepared!
B002B4AAS0|4.0|I'm a big Eels fan, so I'm not shocked that this was a good album.  A  bunch of really nice rocking throwback songs.  I'm a big fan of the neo-50's beach grooves.
B0012QTA8O|4.0|While I do agree with other reviews concerning the lesser quality of artwork, it is still beautiful enough to catch the eye--this deck is definitely unique in that each card has its own definitive personality.  It is perfect for someone with smaller hands-unlike its larger counterpart.  I would recommend this deck to anyone starting out in tarot.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|This CD is by far their best CD. I have owned this CD for a while now, and their music still is not old. I have only one song on here that I do not like - only one! This is a wonderful CD performed by a band with great talent, well worth buying if you can find it for a decent price.     That is the only downside, it is hard to get a hold of often for a decent price in the States.
1594201927|5.0|Being a finance major and coin collector, I read the book as one reads the People magazine. Very informative and entertaining, light and serious at the same time - one gets an understanding of the nuts and bolts of the economy and appreciation for the elaborate financial structures at the time when many tend to blame such structures for failing the humanity. The reality is, the more you make your monies work in different ways the better off you are...I won't even resell it, or give out as a gift, or bring to my office library - it's sitting on the shelf at home for future references.
0553260111|3.0|if your a big fan of the movie, don't buy the book. the story is very different from the movie script, and also the bourne character in the book is pretty dumb. the bourne we're used to won't appear in the book.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|If you're into racing games this product is well worth it. It's adds more comfort to the controller when using R2 & L2 for long periods of time. Your fingers can rest on the bottom of the triggers with a slight sqeeze of the buttons instead of pushing up and in. Something so simple but feels much better.    I wouldn't say RealTriggers are great for every game type since it's much easier to hit R2 & L2 than before and that's not always a good thing so I have them on only two out of four PS3 controllers. Only other issue is that if you are using something like [[ASIN:B000KITCFG Mad Catz SKINZ - Game controller protection cover - silicone]] the RealTriggers may not clear the skins everytime since the RealTriggers are a bit wider than the stock R2 & L2 buttons. The skins do have some give so only a slight issue I noticed with mine.    But overall I highly recommend RealTriggers for gamers that have games using R2 & L2 often, like racing games. Works great for other game types too, but you may need to adjust to the added sensitivity RealTriggers provide. Well made and just snaps on to the stock buttons. Simple and works as promised.
B00095MLGC|2.0|I'm rating the reissue here and not the album itself. The album itself is one of Porcupine Tree's finest and is a psychedelic masterpiece in its own right.    With that said, save yourself the money and track down an original 1993 CD or the much easier to find 1997 remaster. Why? Because this reissue amounts to nothing more than an epic fail on Steven Wilson's part. When an artist goes back years later and revisits their art and changes something, 99.9% of the time it's not for the better. Such is the case with this reissue of Up the Downstair. This reissue is full of revisionist history that would make Frank Zappa twitch. The electronic drums that were on the album originally have been removed and replaced with real drum tracks that were recorded 11 years after-the-fact. I don't have a problem in this in principle, however I do have a problem with it when it means that the original album is now out of print and the revised art gets passed off as the same album.    The real drums just don't work on this record. They don't fill in the space like the drum machines did. Furthermore, on an album that's almost pure electronica such as this, the acoustic drums stick out like a sore thumb.    This reissue is an interesting listen for people who are already familar with the real Up the Downstair album. It provides a new take on the masterpiece, albeit nowhere near as satisfying a take. For people new to the album though, stay far, far away from this and listen to the album the way it was originally. After you're well immersed in it, only then would I recommend checking this out.
031606792X|5.0|I CANNNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH THAT I LOVE THE TWILIGHT SERIES OF BOOKS. I THINK THAT THEY ARE FANTASTIC. I THINK THAT THIS BOOK BREAKING DAWN OUT DOES ALL OF THE OTHER BOOKS AND CANT WAIT FOR ALL THE MOVIES.
B001TK9CYA|4.0|In a December 2007 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS to her 2008 novel, THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY, author Mary Ann Shaffer wrote: \\" ... I hope these characters and their story shed light on the sufferings and strength of the people of the Channel Islands during the German Occupation. I hope, too, that my book will illuminate my belief that love of art -- be it poetry, storytelling, painting, sculpture, or music -- enables people to transcend any barrier man has yet devised.\\"<br /><br />And indeed 80% and more of the novel's text is focused either on the Channel Island of Guernsey during and shortly after five years of German occupation in World War II or on love of art, especially books. And nicely focused, let me add.<br /><br />Yet Mary Ann Shaffer's greatest strength, it seems to me, lies not in historical narrative or in boosting for art but rather in bringing fictional characters to warm, pulsating three-dimensional life. And she would do that, I suspect, whether writing about London, Guernsey's Saint Peter Port or Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso.<br /><br />I am particularly drawn to one character, a very young orphan girl named Kit. Her unwed mother Elizabeth was English and had come to Guernsey as a young girl herself. Her father was a German army captain, an M.D. who hated war and and hoped to return to his beloved Elizabeth when fighting stopped. But he died during fighting and Elizabeth was later executed at Ravensbruck Prison, because of her kindness to a Polish slave laborer on Guernsey.<br /><br />Little Kit is quite the pixie. At novel's begin she is being raised in rotation by doting members of the Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.<br /><br />Much of the novel involves Kit's winning the heart in 1946 of 30-something spinster novelist Juliet Ashton during her months long visit to liberated Guernsey, a Channel island. Here are excerpts from the letter in which Juliet described her first interaction with Kit to her friend and publisher in London:<br /><br />\\"Kit had chubby little legs and a stern face -- dark curls, big grey eyes -- and she did not take to me one bit. *** Kit sat beside me in the wagon and sent me many sideways glances.  ... She sat across from me at supper and turned down her spinach...'Not for me,'she said, and I for one would not care to disobey her. ... I must have passed some test I didn't know I was being given, because Kit asked me to tuck her into bed. She wanted to hear a story about a ferret. She liked vermin, did I? Would I kiss a rat on the lips? I said 'Never' and that apparently won her favor -- I was plainly a coward, but not a hypocrite. I told her a story and she presented her cheek an infinitesimal quarter of an inch to be kissed.\\"<br /><br />I found this a hard book to put down. I admired a well disguised romantic main plot and subplots treated as a detective writer might introduce red herring clues. And spunky little Kit and the people who loved her.  -OOO-tern face -- dark curls, big grey eyes -- and she did not take to me one bit. *** Kit sat beside me in the wagon and sent me many sideways glances.   ...

B0015DWLD0|3.0|though i wanted to finish the book i felt it was too crude.i liked how cocky balram was and also sympathised with him at times but felt he lacked motive to kill his master.with the way he chose to do things it would be only a matter of time till his nephew killed him .
B00009V7OL|2.0|Again, this movie is on the wrong format.  Theback cover show widescreen, but not.  Still it is 4:3.<br />A great movie, but todays standards are not acceptable.<br />Do not buy it, until \\"another\\" new edition will come with true 16:9.
B0011UGLK6|5.0|compared to The Namesake i felt some stories were too open ended.i guess in some stories you get so lost that you what to know how it would have ended.a certain amount of gloom is prominent in all her stories which as an immigrant makes me homesick.i like her writing,it makes it hard to put down.
B0012DOOF6|5.0|quite impressed with the quality of the CD from Russia.  The initial album itself was very good in sound quality, even the extra tracks were impressive.  I would recommend this CD to those who would like a different way the music was recorded.  The CD was in the condition as promised.  Thank you.  James!
B000J0UD94|2.0|I bought the import DVD and it appears to be a digitized version of the VHS widescreen. The image quality is very poor. Cover of the package appears blurry and seems more like a home-made duplication rather than a real off-the-press original. It doesn't do Ridley's film justice.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Probably the best workout video I have come across....I am in shape and workout pretty hard and I find this video to really meet my needs. I have always belonged to a gym BUT with 2 small kids I now workout at home with videos, weights, and my treadmill. Something I do b/c I find the segemnts too short is I either do 2 different levels back to back OR I bought Jillian's book and add my own circuits on at the end. I reverse the dvd back to the first circuit and follow Jillian's \\"time\\" but do my own exercises....then I do her cardio and usually her abs....For example I add tricep extensions for the 30sec exercise and then do a deadliftyupright row combo followed by her cardio and abs....Doing this I make the workout 40 min vs the 28min provided.
1400064287|4.0|I would be surprised to hear of anyone not finding this book enjoyable - it is made up of the same humor and well-researched examples that have made bestsellers out of its brethren, \\"Blink\\" and \\"The Tipping Point.\\" The duo of Chip and Dan Heath actually lifted the idea of \\"stickiness\\" from the pages of Gladwell's \\"The Tipping Point.\\" Here we are given the tricks of the communication trade: Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emotional, Stories. The authors give us a chapter on each of these elements, demonstrating how and why they are effective. Like its predecessors, much of this book's strength lies in the myriad examples and successes used by companies, advertisers, and average people trying to make a difference.<br /><br />The Heath brothers do provide a nice add in the form of \\"case studies,\\" in which they give real world examples for practice. We are given two approaches to help demonstrate how the application of the six stickiness guides can improve communication. Alright, I am making this book sound a little boring and it is certainly not boring. If you have ever wondered why those Subway commercials are so catchy or how \\"don't mess with Texas\\" became so popular or how you could put together a better pitch for your idea, I would suggest giving this book a try. If you liked Gladwell, you'll like these guys. I found this book engaging and surprisingly participatory. I may never look at commercials the same way again and the next time I catch myself singing the \\"five dollar footlong\\" jingle, I will definitely think about this book.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|I realized as I watched the (awful) previews before 'Up' that we live in a dark age.  The kid-film industry churns out film after film, each as dry and unoriginal as thelast.  While there are some worth mentioning, these are few and far between.<br /><br />And then something made me feel incredibly comfortable.  It was that familiar lamp, which hopped across the screen and squashed the 'i' in Pixar.  When I saw that, I knew I was in good hands.<br /><br />Pixar's 'Up' is one, if not the, best animated film in recent past.  It tells the story of Carl Fredrickson, who, as a young boy, dreamed of adventure, inspired by his idol Charles Muntz.  When he meets a girl who shares his affinity for adventure, they become friends.<br /><br />'Up' wastes no time in pulling the audience into the film on an emotional level.  A wordless yet brilliant montage near the beginning of the film tells the story of the two \\"adventurers\\" from childhood to adulthood and beyond.  By the time these masterful five minutes are over, we all feel a connection with Carl on a very deep level.<br /><br />The writing is excellent, with very smart comedy throughout.  the characters are lovable and the animation is, as always, superb.<br /><br />So, in this day and age of throwing ten bucks at some guys who don't care about the quality of movie you and your kids are watching, 'Up' is a funny, fresh, and wonderful reprieve.  A small taste, perhaps, of what a perfect childrens movie would be.<br /><br />Five well earned stars.
0316096199|3.0|I actually had to buy this book for school and was happy to find it for under a dollar! I don't like to read much but the author's story is pretty interesting. It also was a short read which was a plus!
B000F8DT4Q|4.0|I enjoyed the original album tracks much more with the cleaner, remastered sound on this Deluxe edition. The individual guitars and keyboards and vocals stand out more, whereas on the original CD release they seemed to blend in together into homogeneous sonic pudding. The remastering lets you hear the complexity and mastery of the mixing. And the soaring vocals are purer and smoother as well. I should add that the original US vinyl (if in prime condition) is more detailed and vivid than the Deluxe Edition CD, though that might not be a practical option for a lot of buyers. The Deluxe CD sounds very good, and if you can reproduce it properly, the original vinyl sounds very, very good.     Few of the Deluxe extras are of much use to me.     Most if not all of the B-sides are available on the earlier release \\"Saturnine, Martial, and Lunatic,\\" which I already own. I found the B-sides so-so, except for Pharaohs, which is a beautiful keyboard chord progression mixed with a recording of a British weather report and snippets of guitar phrases from Everybody Wants To Rule The World. All in all, it's a fine combination. Unusual, but peaceful and pretty.    Some of the 7\\" single mixes are nice, and would make nice tracks to transfer to your MP3 player for a bit of variety. The 7\\" single mix of Everybody Wants to Rule the World seems exactly the same as the album mix, except perhaps the equalization is a little different. I'm not sure, but they are very very close.     I had a hard time getting through the 12\\" singles. They were elongated, stripped down, and/or weirded-up versions of the originals. They simply didn't sustain my interest, and artistically, I thought they took away from the originals rather than added. Honestly, I think 95% of all song remixes are inferior and not worth the bother. Nothing in this Deluxe Edition has changed my mind on that.     The booklet contains one article/interview about the band and the making of this album. When asked how he feels about the album today, Curt Smith says, \\"...I just think we're a lot better at what we do now. So it's like looking back at schoolwork you did.\\"     That is my impression of the album as well. There are some brilliant spots, and overall it is a good album, but I think Tears For Fears went on to greater heights artistically following Songs From The Big Chair. The better mastering on this new release helps me appreciate what they achieved, but it still isn't my favorite TFF album, and the Deluxe Edition contains a lot that is only of interest to hardcore fans and completists.     Four solid stars. Although, I really ought to deduct another half star because there is NO LYRICS INCLUDED IN THE BOOKLET. Grrrr. For this price? No lyrics? Hmmph.
0375714839|4.0|Persepolis is a graphic memoir, a coming of age story of a girl growing up during the Islamic Revolution. It's sweet, funny, educational, serious, and sad all in turn. The reader acutely feels the longings of the author for love, for normalcy and for acceptance, but in an irreverent and lighthearted way.<br /><br />The second half of the book focuses on Satrapi's time spent in prep school in France. Her experiences as a third culture kid, in a country without parents, are a valuable insight into the loneliness and isolation of that situation. The story doesn't end with a difficult and confusing childhood, but rather sees the author through her maturing process.<br /><br />The simple pen and ink drawings fit the story well, the author is obviously talented and the starkness of them serves to convey the mood. It's a graphic book that's accessible to those less familiar with the format and is well received by readers of a variety of backgrounds. (9/10)
B001ILHY1I|1.0|Didn't enjoy this movie. I read lot of positive reviews before I bought this dvd and thought it would be a good film. finally it wasn't that good enough. this is movie with no story at all and its just some 3D made animation and effects. it was like computer game.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|then, take it from there!  I LOVED the movie and Tommy Lee as well.  I surely will need to watch it again and again to pick up even more of what the author was trying to relate. There are secrets inside the folds of this movie that I wonder if the book unravels.  I will have to get that as well..............!  :)  I honestly belive we do bring in unfinshed business from the past.  But, how far  back?  And, we must also finish undone business........... This moive has kept me thinking all day on mine.......Happy moive watching :)
B0017HEYEI|1.0|My five year old wanted the Snow White DVD.  Since Disney is not currently selling it, I referred to Amazon's list of vendors.  I purchased this DVD from Bargain Media Shop through Amazon.com.  Wow, was I in for a surprise when I pulled it out of the box and it was in Korean!  Not only is it in Korean, but the box indicates it has an English version...well if you can read Korean you might be able to figure out how to program the English version.      Additionally, this DVD got gummed up in my DVD player and ruined it.
0446579939|5.0|There's something very intriguing about a romance written from the male prospective, and something so appealing about Nicholas Sparks's style of writing! I loved the characters in this story - they were so well-drawn! I loved the showdown between Logan and Keith. And, I loved the interaction between the adults and Ben. This is an excellent book, with an interesting storyline, particularly the background of the Persian Gulf and Iraqi war and its veterans.
B001NLL8LA|2.0|I love Lee 'Child., one of our best fiction writers, this one just seems so long, so wordy, way too detailed.. pages discussing weapons, pages and pages discussing the subway system.  its almost like a 100 page book turned into a 400 page book.. I really dont like to say anything bad about any author because i cant imagine what thinking and hard work goes in to their books, but i ordered this on Kindle and paid 9.99 and wish i would have skipped it all together.  unbelieveably long and boring story plot, really dumb sex scene which lent absolutely nothing to the story and was hard to believe.  This book,  i would have to say is his worse to date. so please dont decide on his talent with this one, pick up anything else he has written and you will be happy.  dont know what he was thinking, but hopefully the next will be better.

B000R3QZ2C|2.0|I have no idea what Rattle is attempting here - but somewhere in his rise to the top of his profession he's managed to forget all the things that once made him an excellent Haydn conductor - or for that matter, an excellent conductor, period!<br /><br />From the lame unsprung rhythms of the Minuet of 88, where, instead of the bracing life-affirming fff stomp of a Furtwangler or a Scherchen, Rattle gives us a matter of fact statement of the forte carefully played and incapable of awakening anybody to stepping out - let alone back from the dead as Scherchen plays it! - and all the way to Rattle's handling of the final Presto of 92, where the opening woodwind's notating is completely smeared - and all the way between - this is just a total mess. Volumes too often merge together, rather than contrast. Playing continually runs down rhythmically, like water seeking the lowest level. One minute Rattle goes for rubato and odd tempo changes with all the trimmings and odd quirks ala Frans Bruggen and his Orchestra of the 18th Century, forgetting that Bruggen can do this without losing his edge because he brings far more alacrity to his proceedings through knowingly playing off the harsher contrasts of his period instruments. By comparison, Rattle's ensemble using modern instruments designed and played by the Berlin players for optimum melding sounds like a nun on a burleske stage. Then, just as you wonder what possibly could be the point to such contradictory proceedings, Rattle suddenly alters his style, and rushes things along to a strict metronome count as unyielding as Gardiner. It's positively crazy - there's no overall unifying vision, and the playing ends up saying nothing.<br /><br />I have no idea whose idea was this disaster - but why would one go out of his - or her- way to drastically reduce the forces of the Berlin Philharmonic in the first place for such grandly symphonic music is beyond my comprehension. We have far too many examples of smaller bands! As I have said before, and often, Haydn would LOVE to hear the full Berlin play his music. I mean really, would you tell Haydn, \\"We're only going to use the full orchestra for this Shostakovitch piece later in the program, your music gets the small group.\\" Yeah, right. Haydn was a reasonable man, but he knew his worth, and were he brought back from the grave I'm sure his reply would be ferociously and clear - \\"Like Blazes you're going to sell my music short! You play it with the full orchestra or don't bother!\\"<br /><br />Why articifically create another smaller ensemble from a group so peerless as the Berlin? Is this what we can expect from Rattle in the futrue when he essays Mozart's Jupiter? It makes no sense - especially for this large scaled - yes, even Olympian music. But worse, having shrunk the forces, one might at least expect period instruments and far more careful delineation, and better more precise readings. The idea that one reviewer claims, that you can have your cake and eat it too, with 18th century period style and late 20th century super smooth intonation and teamwork is laughable! This is the worst of both worlds.<br /><br />Symphony 88 is one of the grandest, most heroic symphonies in the entire classical repetorie. And 92 is not far behind. Denying these works their true glory with the full complement of the Berlin Philharmonic, as Furtangler used, is not so much a blunder, as unmitiagted baloney! Rattle does not expand our vision of the mighty works, he shrinks it!<br /><br />Boo!and often, Haydn would LOVE to hear the full Berlin play his music.

0380799006|5.0|I am so thankful for this book.  I consider myself a \\"good\\" parent, but after reading this book, I see so many changes that I am going to make in my parenting style!  I am guilty of too much praising with my older son.  Because he has behavioral issues, I am constantly looking to praise the good things that he does.  Now I realize that it would be more beneficial for both he and his younger brother if I helped them feel pride in themselves and not get there kudos from me.  I actually knew that from psych, but I didn't know how to go about it.  That's what this book does - it gives really clear, easy to understand examples on what to say.  Most of us have good intentions - and this book helps make them a reality.  I love the familiar-voice writing style and the \\"group therapy\\" feel to it.  It makes you feel like you are one of the parents in this book.  The stories they share make me feel like they are watching me and my kids!  I also liked how it said to allow angry feelings.  I didn't grow up like that - and it really opened my eyes.  Fabulous book!

0956010903|5.0|JK Rowling's work of bringing Harry's world in touch with our own has given us a treasure far beyond the magic of which she writes.  She has created magic in our imaginations and hearts through her literature and this Collector's Edition of her \\"book within a book (within a book)\\" pays tribute to that magic.  If you're at all in love with Harry's world, this book is a treasure beyond compare.  If only for the sake of having been alive at the time in which her phenomenon occurred, one ought to acquire a copy!<br />The actual book and guise book are very well-made.  Though not of genuine leather, the look and feel of both is perfectly sufficient as more of the proceeds are then able to go to the Children's High Level Group foundation the book was originally made to support.  The metalwork on the cover of the actual book has a very nice weight to it and, hinged from the back, the clasp is magnetic... evincing a magic of its own, I suppose. :)<br />The accompanying illustrations are charming and grouped together in an envelope behind a sleeve in the guise book, the interior of which is made of a faux suede.  The burgundy, velvet-like bag in which the actual book rests is beautifully embroidered with Ms. Rowling's signature in gold thread.<br />Truly a treat for any great fan, the Collector's Edition of The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a treasure all its own.
0375704027|5.0|So when it comes to Haruki Murakimi there are two basic sets of fans. There are the Alfred Birnbaum fans and the Jay Rubin fans. Birnbaum translated much of Murakami's early work into English language editiions for sale in Japan, published to help Japanese students of English, through Kodansha. When Kodansha published two of Murakami's novels in America--A Wild Sheep Chase and Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World--they stuck with the existing Birnbaum translations. When Knoff was putting together a collection of short stories, Jay Rubin wanted desperately to translate some of Murakami, and since he and Birnbaum gravitated to entirely different kinds of stories, they split the work between them. From that time on, Rubin has been Murakami's translator of choice and, occasionally alternating with Philip Gabriel, has been the one to interpret Murakami's work for the English-speaking world. When Norwegian Wood was eventually (belatedly) published in America and England, Rubin provided a new translation. And apparently it is the one Murakami prefers.    I do not. I've always found Rubin's translations a little dull. Not unreadable. Certainly not bad. But he's not one to go for the exciting word choice or the more spontaneous-sounding prose. His is a careful, graceful, but slightly grey style. I think it's to the detriment of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, actually (to be fair, he got the gig because Birnbaum asked for a break; I believe had this not happen Birnbaum would have been chosen tranlator, and maybe remained the central interpreter of Murakimi in English. But of course, there's no way to know). That Rubin should be the less satisfying translator is odd, since in fact he admires Murakami almost slavishly. It's very clear in any talk or article you read by him on the subject of Murakami.    Norwegian Wood is to my mind Murakami's most successful novel. I'm not as crazy about his pop fantasy works. I think they're enjoyable, but the existenialism is more pleasantly trippy than frighteningly nightmarish, and the social criticism isn't all that penetrating. Here, by contrast, dealing with a realistic situations involving young adults, he really catches hold of something. Toru is a less pleasant character than many Murakami protagonists. Not as gentle, not as poetic, more unhappily alieanted (as opposed to, say, the protagonist of A Wild Sheep Chase, who is romantically, appealingly alienated). I don't want to give the impression he's an anti-hero, that would be going too far. But he's a warts-and-all rather than a romanticized conception.    And I think this is true for all the characters. Naoko isn't just another quirky Murakami heroine, she's disturbed and it causes her much pain, in a way reminiscent of Catherine in Jules and Jim (fittingly, as this novel takes place largely in the late 1960's). Midori, the other girl in Toru's life, is more playfully eccentric, but she's also somewhat untrustworthy and selfish. These are real people, and they relate to the real world, and not just because there is not alternate-universe jumping or magical realist imagining, but because Murakami makes us believe in their situations, their pains, and their failings. Though the book brought down criticism from devoted fans when originally published in Japan, I think it is his most serious effort as a novelist, and his most daring.     And I think it's best in the translation Birnbaum penned for Japanese students of English. That translation is no longer in print, but copies are available. Sometimes they are quite expensive (I paid over a hundred dollars for mine). But I think they are worth it.    Read in Rubin's easily obtainable edition, the novel is simply not as satisfying. That dependable, grey style again. Particularly in the longer chapters, it can make pushing forward a chore. But, of course, it's better than nothing.

0517548232|5.0|With the current (6/2009) economic crisis well underway, this book reads like it was just written.  The fact that it was written 60+ years ago is a surprise.  There is nothing out of the ordinary about this crisis.  Politicians today say the same things that politicians said for at least the last 100 years.    I have read the chapter 'The Mirage of Inflation' many times, worth the price of the book.

1591840562|2.0|Kawasaki does offer a framework for those seeking funding, but other than that, it offers very little for real boot-strapped start-ups seeking to innovate.    As an aside, the reader is left wondering if Kawaski made his fortune from writing books about making money, rather than really having a method.  And if he did have a real method, he's not sharing it here because I didn't learn much from reading this book.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout can definitely be done by beginners.  I haven't worked out since 2005- that's 4 years.  And I've managed to gain 40 pounds since! After renting this from the library, I decided to buy it. I did this workout for the first time, last Friday morning.  There were a few times when I couldn't keep up and had to sit out to catch my breath.  I was also very nauseous for about an hour afterward.  The next morning, I couldn't walk down the steps without a hand-rail.  There is a lot in there for only 20 minutes (Strength, Cardio, Abs)!  Sunday, I took my kids to the zoo like I promised.  My knees buckled a little throughout the day, but we saw the whole park.  So today is Tuesday, and I decided my break was over.  I just completed the workout again- and what a difference!  Although initially terrified, I was able to push through the entire workout with minimal stops, and the exercises seemed a tad easier.  I didn't feel like I was going to die so much this time.  I'm sure that tomorrow will be even better.  (I think I'm going to move up from the 3lb dumbbells to the 5lbs too!)  So if you feel that this is not for beginners- give yourself an entire week to be able to do the workout.  You have to break yourself in.
B000U0F7RG|4.0|The show itself is fantastic!  The writing, acting, and chemistry between the ensemble of actors is without equal.  The show offers a wide variety of elationships and social situations that are believable.  I care about and feel I know on a personal level each character and I really like them all.      The ability of Graham and Bledel to deliver complex lines at a very fast pace make the rythym of the dialoge exceptional.  This show recreates for all viewers the sense of belonging to a small town where residents know and care about each other that few in this country have an opportunity to experience in the real world.    My only complaint is that one of the 42 discs in the set would not play.
0345494768|5.0|J. W. Rinzler always delivers when it comes to documenting the making-of processes of movies. But I never thought he could out-do himself ten times over in this book. Very simply said: You will NEVER read a more comprehensive book about ANY movie... I mean EVER. Every single piece of information about the first Star Wars movie is simply there, from old early drafts (it is almost shocking how the original conception of the saga is so radically different from the final product, especially because the original script drafts have almost no humor) to the complete set of gorgeous Ralph McQuarrie paintings in full color and detail, to most models used in special effects to an almost breath-taking chronology of events, including money & ego troubles, set accidents, fights, and so much more.<br />Don't get me wrong, this is a long read, at more than 400 pages. It took me almost two months of occasional reading to complete it, but it was well worth it. Call this the ultimate Original Star Wars Bible if you will. The hardcover book contains some extra material including a complete set of storyboards and a cute little compilation of anecdotes written by Lucas about the backgrounds of the film's characters--they differ radically from the arcs and character backgrounds later provided by the prequels.<br />A must-read for every Star Wars fan. I can only hope Rinzler and Bouzeraou will do the same thing for Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|I may be extra harsh on this film because `Casino Royale' was such a blessed cinematic experience for me.  I was not in the least a huge fan of James Bond, but 2006 totally changed my opinion when it unleashed the brilliance that was `Casino Royale' (ranks in my top ten of the year and garners a Lead Actor and an Adapted Screenplay nomination from me at my personal awards, The Ellington's).  Because that film was so cleverly crafted, I expected a lot from `Quantum of Solace'.<br /><br />I wanted it to be bigger, bolder...better.<br /><br />Instead of building off the intensity provided by deep character development and genuine attachment to plot points, `Quantum of Solace' goes in a different direction and just merely offers the audience a briskly paced thrill ride with hard bodies and `Bourne' style action sequences.  I'm not saying that a good action flick is a bad thing, but when you have such a wonderful starting point it is disappointing to see them somewhat throw away all that they worked to achieve by reverting backwards and delivering something that just doesn't stack up.<br /><br />The films plot seems a little underdeveloped (the film is also about an hour shorter than `Casino Royale', which may be part of the problem) and so it becomes almost forgettable.  This is sad, because the film doesn't provide us with the character development needed to make the films plot unnecessary.  Daniel Craig does a fine job presenting us with a sour Bond, one that doesn't really need to develop because we saw him grow to this point so lavishly in `Casino Royale', but Craig is not the only actor here and Bond is not the only character.  The sad thing is that Bond is the only interesting one.  Vesper was such an exciting Bond Girl, and so when I see someone as beautifully dense as Olga Kurylenko's, Camille take her place I'm left a little brokenhearted.  There is no denying that Olga is a ravishingly beautiful actress, but Camille is such an underdeveloped beauty that she practically becomes nothing but eye candy.  I'm glad they gave her a character arc, but it really isn't much of an original one (very `been-there-done-that').  She has a coldness that I liked, but she could have done so much more had they really tried to flesh her out.<br /><br />Dench is perfect, as usual (love the inspired casting of this role), Jeffrey Wright is good, Gemma Arterton is gorgeous and Mathieu Amalric is sorely miscast.<br /><br />I know that this sounds rather harsh, and the film itself it not bad (I own it and will watch it again), but I just want to express my disappointment.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I don't think so.  When you come out of the gate with a blistering and inspired take on a film franchise you have an obligation to back it up.  Look at what Nolan did with his sequel to `Batman Begins', or even what Raimi did with his sequel to `Spider Man'.  They took what they did in their first film and flipped it on its head, delivering to us an even better film the second go around.  They built on their original film.  Maybe the change in directors had a hand in this films fate, but there is no way that one can say that Marc Forster does any justice to Martin Campbell's `Casino Royale'.<br /><br />So, if I were to grade this film separated from `Casino Royale', grading it as if I never saw Campbell's film, then I'd give it a B.  It is entertaining, action packed and exciting, and the brisk running time makes it so that you never get bored and never have time to really notice that the film is lacking in any real emotional connection.  It is also no where near the campy stupidity of some in this franchise and so the plot never makes one want to throw a shoe at the screen.  But, sadly (well, sadly for this film) I have seen `Casino Royale' and so I cannot grade this film separated from its predecessor.  Having said that, I give the film a C+.  It should have been much better.<br /><br />Thankfully it's not `that' bad.ing but eye candy.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|I didnt catch this in the theaters, so I can only speculate on the validity of the comments regarding the subtitles. Either way, this is a great film. I haven't felt this enthusiastic about a movie since Pan's Labyrinth. Lonely and tormented Oskar meets his new neighbor Eli, a dark and seemingly wise young girl at the hieght of his despair. They soon form a bond driven by their mutual disconnect with the world around them.     The greatest genre films somehow find a new approach, and the genius of this one is it's simplicity. All vampire stories are about loss of innocence, yet there always seems to be resistence to explore evil from the point of view of the truly innocent. In this story, we never really feel that evil exist in the heart of any of the characters, yet the tension is great. Even after the film's bloody climax, we feel that not all goodness is lost from our heroes. While we may feel conflicted about the outcome, we never doubt the goodness and purity in Oskar's intentions.   I purchased this version, and will likely purchase the one with the more proper subtitles. I would recomend this movie,and I'm certain that it will have a large following in the years to come.
0316017922|4.0|I've just finished reading Malcolm Gladwell's latest study of human behavior, Outliers, about the backstory of success in America and to a lesser degree, in the world. The other books are The Tipping Point and Blink, both of which I enjoyed immensely. Outliers did not disappoint. Gladwell delivers a diverse range of applications of his thesis with humor and the kind of penetrating wisdom you would expect from a poet who can reveal some hidden secret in something you think you know all about but have never really seen.<br /><br />Someone asked me if Outliers was a religious book, and I told them that it could be a way to understand the more subtle and powerful ways of grace in our world. But while Gladwell prompts an exploration of the road to success (and how we might widen it a bit), his definition of success creates an extraordinary tension he can never resolve.<br /><br />Stratospheric success, it turns out, according to Gladwell, involves the gift of talent and extraordinary, relentless hours of practice - 10,000 hours of practice. That's the kind of precision Gladwell delivers repeatedly, like the fact that you can recall a series of numbers you can recite in 2 seconds, or how the ability to stay with a math problem for 22 minutes makes the difference between excelling in math and merely surviving. Or if you're a southerner who has just received an insult, you'll walk to within 2 feet of a bouncer before turning aside, rather than 6 feet (for anyone not from the south). All of the numbers, of course, are based on studies Gladwell cites to buttress his argument that reads more like a conversation over a really good meal.<br /><br />The last tidbit exemplifies the thesis that gives the book title an ironic twist: in addition to talent and determination, outliers are inevitably products of their families and the larger communities (living and dead) and even history - in other words, they're not really outliers at all - they're inescapably woven into the human social fabric. And though Gladwell spends much more time exploring this thesis than suggesting ways to capitalize on it in society, he repeatedly asserts that taking the social environment part of the success equation far more seriously would result in far more opportunity for success.<br /><br />Near the end of the book, he cites an inner city school program that closes the well-known learning gap between rich and poor students by extending the classroom hours and nixing a three-month summer break (where studies Gladwell cites demonstrate the real reason for the learning gap between rich and poor occurs). Earlier in the book, Gladwell writes about a group of geniuses followed by a sociologist whose success or failure correlated well with the income and education levels of their parents. The extended hours school program recognizes this cultural reality and then mitigates it essentially by removing the kids from their unsupportive home environment.<br /><br />Another example of what Gladwell refers to as taking cultural factors seriously involves the retraining of Korean pilots in the wake of a series of accidents. Recognizing that a Korean culture of deference to superiors made it difficult for co-pilots to correct pilot errors, an (American) consultant banished the Korean language from the cockpits, essentially creating a competing cockpit culture that would allow the egalitarian cooperation necessary to safely fly commercial jets. And of course it worked.<br /><br />But this is just where Gladwell's highly entertaining book leaves me unsettled. The author shifts between the draconian social re-engineering I mention above on the one hand and a resignation to the fate of (for instance) being born in 1835, 1917, 1951, or on January 1, which would give you a much better chance to be one of the richest persons in the history of the world, a highly successful Jewish lawyer in New York, an architect of the PC revolution, or a professional Canadian hockey player, respectively.<br /><br />Radical social reengineering (or, more to the point, eradication, as in the Korean Airline cockpits) to level the playing field for far more people to succeed and \\"luck\\" (to use Bill Gates' words) form opposite poles of Gladwell's study of success. But I can find no middle ground - no spectrum of what I have come to call Grace in between the harsh poles of Make and Fate. In the end, Gladwell refuses a \\"bloom where you're planted\\" ethic for a success standard imposed by a non-existent patchwork culture he forms from Asian rice farmers to European tailors and obnoxious air traffic controllers from the Bronx - all with the goal of getting into a mythical house on a hill, via a road marked with 10,000 hours of unrelenting toil for greatness.<br /><br />His epilogue is a colorful description of his own patchwork Jamaican/English/African cultural history, which makes a kind of sense, given the thrust of his thesis. The view from his house on a hill must be marvelous, and he justly recognizes that it is built literally on the foundation of the backs of his tireless and blessed forebears (blessed by fortune in ironic ways).<br /><br />As it happens, I'm also reading Tom Sawyer to my 12 year old son and 11 year old foster son, each night as they go to bed. They boys love the hero of the quintessentially American tale, and strive to emulate him in their lives. They look forward to a golden summer of delights at the helm of a mountain bike, in the pool, surrounded by budding beauty they (like Tom) are beginning more and more to appreciate, and at the computer screen, where they live out a heroic existence Tom would not have been able to imagine. My son is gifted with extraordinary intelligence in math and science. My foster son is a whiz on the basketball court and skating rink - and is remarkably observant. My daughter already dreams of putting her considerable empathy and music talent together into a career in music therapy.<br /><br />The idea of sending them to a rice paddy this summer to increase their chance at success seems to mock the very idea of success. And grace. No doubt hard work finds its own reward. But the culture that nurtures them and my wife and me encourages us to value other virtues as well, like friendship, sacrifice for others, and Sabbath. And grace. Which promises me and my community that God has indeed gifted us all for a purpose.<br /><br />In the midst of his discussion of the arduous labor involved in rice farming in China, Gladwell defines what he calls meaningful work. To be meaningful, Gladwell asserts that work must involve (1) a clear relationship between effort and reward; (2) complexity; and (3) autonomy (p. 236). Those sound like the reflections of an entrepreneur - an author, perhaps, from the vantage point of the house on a hill. They are the words of a self-made man (albeit haunted by the injustice of fate that allowed him to make himself on the backs of others).<br /><br />The words I would use to define meaningful work would be challenge, variety, and value (not merely defined in terms of money, of course). Life work should be stimulating, worthy of the creator and their creativity, and it should make the world a better place. Perhaps that's too much to ask, but in the end, I'd rather not settle for anything less (for myself or for anyone else). Success does not mean masking my cultural impediments, but recognizing in them (and in myself) unique strengths and (as I would label them as a pastor) gifts from God.<br /><br />Gladwell entertains, surely. And he has collected a stunning amount of data to ponder the meaning of success. But his title dooms his thesis by posing an insoluble dilemma: how to escape the bonds of one's culture in order to achieve \\"success\\". He is right about one thing, certainly. There are no true outliers in the human community. No islands.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|When Bruce Dickinson left Iron Maiden to poursue a solo career in 1993 the band had to look for a new singer.That singer turned out to be former Wolfsbane Blaze Bayley,he did two albums with the band [[ASIN:B000063DGJ The X Factor]] and [[ASIN:B000063DGM Virtual XI]] who were meet with poor reactions by fans.I'll just say that his style didn't suit the band and following his departure Bruce Dickinson returned to Maiden in 1999.The best of this is that Adrian Smith came back as well.Now Iron Maiden's new lineup was the same as the classic one but Janick Gers is still playing in the band meaning that they have three guitarists wich makes a monster show live.It was a turn for the best in the Maiden camp and the arrival of Bruce and Adrian gave a new life to the band.<br /><br />At the turn of the century however,things have very much changed since Bruce had left the band.Many artists came with some rap sounds added to their music and nu-metal came in.I'm glad to say that Maiden ignored all of this and remained true to their music and they did one of their best albums here.Who would have tought Maiden could come back and do such a great album after the last two?Not me,and not unless Bruce came back!Brave New World turns out to be one of ther best albums,it sounds like old Maiden,they're definatly back.The songs are incredible,the playing is tight,everything sounds good.<br /><br />It feels really good to have Bruce and Adrian back in the band,they're playing like they've never been gone!Right with the first song \\"The Wicker Man\\" you know that Maiden is back for real.Amongst the songs I enjoyed best are \\"The Gost Of Navigator\\" a song I think everyone so far has mentionned as one of their favourite,\\"Blood Brothers\\" is a great song to me,maybe a little long and repetitive but still great I love the guitar,\\"The Fallen Angel\\" and \\"Dream Of Mirrors\\" who both have a great choruses.I'd say there's not a bad song but I'm not really a fan of \\"Out Of The Silent Planet\\".I could make a song-by-song review but that's not my point,my point is if you're a fan you have to get this,Its such an amzing album.<br /><br />I think the album suffers from one particular thing : repetitiveness,some songs can tend be quite repetitive and long.I'd say that it is the only bad thing about the album.Every fan will find something to like about Brave New World,it's a great comeback album for the band.It seems like they haven't changed much,its the old Maiden we used to love.It features all of what these guys always did,great time changes,great solos,solid playing,great vocals,just amazing altogheter!The songs are also quite long on this one,they're refusing to age!Four songs over 7 minutes and the rest are pretty long too.Overall you need this album,your collection of Iron Maiden will not be complete without it.review but that's not my point,my point is if you're a fan you have to get this,Its such an amzing album.

B000E6ET1G|5.0|I still own the original double album and recently purchased the CD.  This is a remarkable classic set of exciting rock gems from the 60's.  Plug it in and crank it up!! These songs showcase artists pushing the boundaries in different ways and this is the music that helped pave the way for much of what was to come to the FM dial in the next decade and beyond. Lenny Kaye did a remarkable job in selecting these songs. Awesome!
B0000844M8|5.0|More tragedy on the plains of Africa...<br /><br />Astonishingly, Joy Adamson and George Adamson were both murdered, in 1980 and 1989 respectively.<br /><br />Joy's death was originally thought to be due to a lion mauling, according to the autopsy report. Then it was hinted that she had been murdered with a weapon which inflicted wounds similar to a lion's...traces of metal in the cut flesh. Finally, Paul Nakware Ekai, one of the compound's employees, was charged and convicted of her murder. He initially admitted to stabbing Joy, later stating that she had shot him in the foot, and he, in turn, of shooting her three times. Her temperament was not, by some accounts, remotely similar to Miss  McKenna's.<br /><br />George was shot and killed by Somali bandits while coming to the aid of a safari.<br /><br />Parenthetically, Dian Fossey (Gorillas in the Mist)was brutally murdered in 1985. Her true assailant, a government official, has recently been charged with her murder, though two others were earlier convicted of the crime, Kangaroo-Court style.<br /><br />The 1980's were bad years for prominent naturalists.<br /><br />1966 was a good vintage for great films: Born Free, A Man for all Seasons, The Professionals, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.<br /><br />Nice to experience (not merely see) films where you respect and admire all of the central characters, human or otherwise.
0316017922|3.0|I am a big Malcolm Gladwell fan, and Outliers, while an enjoyable read, was my least favorite of his books so far.   Outliers has the same riveting storytelling style, and I loved the Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes and The Trouble with Geniuses story of Christopher Langan.  But I was left with the somber feeling that success is a cosmic conflicting mix of random and pre-ordained, and either way, there isn't much that could be done about it.    It was the opposite feeling I had reading a similar, success-themed book, Geoff Colvin's Talent Is Overrated.  Talent didn't have as breezy a style  but at least it had an uplifting point (success is hard work, actually REALLY hard work, 10,000 hours' worth).   Colvin also actually had practical advice we could use -- the importance of Deliberate Practice, for example.    Outliers has the fun stories and does remind us that hard work and talent play roles in success.  But it left me empty and unmotivated, probably not the effect I am going to want to pass onto my coaching clients.     Read it for the interesting anecdotes and certainly if you're a Gladwell fan, but seek your success tips elsewhere.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|This is a great movie that keeps you going the entire time.  It shines on Blu-ray.  I highly recommend you watch it the first time on Blu-ray.  Liam Neeson is the right man for the job and I found myself cheering him on.  But, I don't recommend buying the movie until it also comes with a digital copy.  I Netflixed it and was glad I did.  On a movie like this, once you know the ending the reason I watch it again is to fill in some of the little bits that I might of missed.  Doing this on my iphone while waiting for the doctor or some other appointment is a great way to re-live the experience.  Unfortunatly, this movie did not come with a digital copy like a lot of the major films do now days.  I only have one Blu-ray player so until it comes out with a digital copy, I Netflix.  I recommend you do the same.
B00000JZI9|3.0|Seen worse.  SILVERADO has its entertaining moments, to be sure, and while actors like Scott Glenn and Danny Glover look believable sitting on a horse and sporting a six-shooter, other actors like Kevin Kline and Jeff Goldblum have me rolling on the floor.  Please.  Kevin and Jeff never should have ventured off the set of [[ASIN:B00000G3I2 The Big Chill]]; urban is definitely their forte.<br /><br />Meant to revive the Western genre when it was released in the mid-Eighties, SILVERADO is a mongrel of several retread plots heated up and served again.  Vengeance--check.  Cattlemen vs. farmers--check.  Racism--most definitely.  Main Street showdown between good guy and bad guy--of course.  And if I didn't lose count, you have to get to the fourth saloon scene where a fight doesn't break out.  Ah, predictability.<br /><br />Brian Dennehy plays a good villain, and although he, too, looks out of place (see Kline and Goldblum referenced above) I sure got a kick out of Brit dandy John Cleese playing a sheriff.  (\\"As you can tell, I am not from these parts.\\")  A young Kevin Costner is so annoying I wanted to shoot him myself.  Again, some of it works, some of it doesn't, but if you can get past all the trite and hackneyed and overused cliches SILVERADO is okay.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B001GCUNYO|3.0|I've seen this movie a couple dozen times now.  A man loses a family member and kills everyone responsible.  There's no tension because you know what's going to happen.  He tortures, kills, etc., his way to the goal.  Man on Fire is a much better version of this same story.  Liam Neeson is an extraordinary actor and he adds a little bit of coolness to an otherwise cliche repetition of the same old thing.  By far the best part of the movie is the phone call where Neeson says menacingly and coolly that he's going to come kill the guy.  But I saw that on the trailer 100 times already.
B000007ODY|5.0|I have long thought there are just two very good ways to conduct Brahms' symphonic output. One is to emphasize the use of color and intermittently lush textures in the orchestration. The other is to emphasize the vigor and uncompromising rejection of the sound of Wagner and his allies. This set is the best example of the first side of Brahms' symphonies. The set George Szell made with his ensemble, the Cleveland Symphony, is the best example of the latter.  Which recordings someone buys will be determined by one's tastes and what can be afforded. Sometimes the works of a composer lend themselves to more than one kind of interpretation, as Brahms' symphonies do. On the other hand there are some composers whose works do not lend themselves to different interpretations, like Mozart. There is good Mozart, and then there is bad Mozart, which is basically just dull and plodding.  If I could afford to buy only one recording, I would pick this set of Karajan's from the late seventies.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|This is the ultimate movie for a rush. You never know what the next tornado will bring.
0451528298|5.0|The Moonstone is the perfect introduction to the Victorian novel.  Written in the day of serialized fiction, when reading was still a primary form of entertainment, The Moonstone is a gem.  Full of cliffhangers, written from multiple points of view, it's the tale of a stolen jewel whose original owners will stop at nothing to get it back.  In the hands of a lesser author, The Moonstone would be confusing and rambling, but Wilkie Collins so adeptly drew his characters and gave his narrators such distinctive voices that the reader is drawn deeper and deeper into the story, anxious to read on to see what is going to happen. The tale is liberally strewn with clues, but it's the description and the characters who make it so readable.  Who could ever forget the ominous and deadly Shivering Sands or Miss Clack's cheerful and relentless distribution of improving 'little tracts'?<br /><br />Unrequited love, greed, jealousy, hypocrisy; valiant heroes, romantic heroines, exotic villains, comic relief and a mystery to tie them all together-everything we love to read about is present in lavish measures. The Moonstone is a book to curl up with on a winter weekend and get lost in.  One of the best of Victorian novels, when a precise turn of phrase was appreciated and families eagerly gathered by the fireside each week to hear the latest installment read aloud, The Moonstone has been in print since 1868 for good reason.  It's a great story told by a master storyteller and puts most romantic suspense novels to shame.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who is tired of what's currently available in the fiction marketplace.  Read this and see what an excellent book really is!
B001TODCII|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. Excellent!
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|\\"Up\\" the latest joint offering from Disney and Pixar definitely has that effect on your emotions.  From the beautifully drawn posters to the triumphant end, this film's a winner.     Carl Fredricksen (v. by Ed Asner) admired explorers even from boyhood. His particular favorite hero was Charles Muntz (v. by Christopher Plummer) who traveled to Paradise Falls in South America and discovered a new species of bird.  Unfortunately, all he was able to recover was a skeleton.  Scientists examined the skeletal remains and stated the bird was a fake. So, Muntz returned to Paradise Falls in ignominy vowing to find the bird and reclaim his honor.    Young Carl was a true believer in Muntz's dream.  So, it turned out was Ellie.  The two adventurers made an instant team and built their dreams together into a marriage.  They always planned to go to Paradise Falls, but life intervened.      Then, Ellie died leaving Carl alone in their big house.  We see him embittered and embattled struggling against the encroachment of a new development right next door.      An unfortunate accident has Carl declared a menace to society and sent to a retirement home.  But, Carl has other ideas.  He's taking his house with all the treasure of a lifetime and he's using helium balloons tied up in the fireplace and getting out of there...    What Carl doesn't know is that he's got a stowaway on the front porch.  Young Russel (v. by Jordan Nagai) is trying to win his Wilderness Scouts badge for assisting the elderly when he gets snared in Carl's scheme.     The adventure's begun.  Yes, the two do get to Paradise Falls.  They even find Muntz and some adventure....    \\"Up\\" is a multi-generational film that will lift spirits of both young and old.  I'd strongly recommend grandparents taking their kids to see this film.  One thing--while the story looks like it's good for even the very young, the children below 7 in the audience didn't quite understand all the facets in this story.  Using Nickelodeon's ratings, I'd call this a Y7--recommended for kids over 7 years of age.      Rebecca Kyle, June 2009
B0018M6J90|4.0|Frances McDormand and Amy Adams ably provide an hour and a half of charm and wit in this stylish comic drama adapted from the 1938 light classic novel.  Ms. McDormand plays a dowdy, unemployed nanny with personality issues who falls into the glamorous world of theater and fashion after a bit of desperate subterfuge to land a job.  Of course, Ms. McDormand's Miss Pettigrew character turns out to have the exactly right combination of solid values and feet-on-the-ground common sense that her new employer, Ms. Adams' flightly actress/singer character Delysia LaFosse, needs in her life at that moment.  And that was fine; predictability isn't necessarily a bad thing if the predictable developments are satisfying.<br /><br />But what's nice is that Delysia's world also gives something back to Ms. Pettigrew, as a little style and excitement is just what the lonely spinster needs.  Furthermore, Miss Pettigrew soon sees that, aside from possibly helping Delysia make the right decisions about her own romantic life, she just might attain a great romance of her own.<br /><br />While there's some predicability in the plot, the flavor of the film is anything but.  At times it's old fashioned and plays out like a 1930's screwball comedy- energetic and sassy, but ultimately polite- and other times it's bawdy and sexy and quite daring.  There's even possibly some level of sexual tension and attraction between Ms. Pettigrew and Delysia, though the charge I detected between them is definitely subtle, and maybe based more on an admiration of each other's strengths than a hidden mutual desire.

B00003CXD0|4.0|It's strange how seeing a man dressed up as a woman always seems to be funny and popular with the audiences. Milton Berle helped make television a hit with skits like this on his early 1950s show. It works here, too, with Dustin Hoffman applying the makeup and playing the role to the hilt.    Helping Hoffman is Jessica Lange in, by far, her most attractive role. I'm not particularly a fan of hers but she looked spectacular in here, almost like Marilyn Monroe.    This was a popular film because the humor was good and the two leads did a nice job, and people like a good romance story, too. Hoffman,  a fabulous actor, has always been  able to play diverse roles. He's an amazing actor.    Sometimes overlooked is the big-name supporting cast which includes Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr, Bill Murray, Chares Durning and Geena Davis. The latter was making her screen debut in here!

1400034779|5.0|Love, love this book.  It's written so simply and beautifully.  I had read other of the books in the series and went back to read the number one book so that I could understand what happened first.  Precious Ramotswe is a gem.  Nothing escapes this woman's eye.  Yet she always has time for a break and nice cuppa bush tea.  I wish I could join her and we could have  a talk and a little gossip about the situations in Gaborone, Botswana that she is sorting out. Her assistant Mma. Makutsi is a scene stealer.  She is so serious about her job and very conscientious. She was very proud of the fact that she earned 97% on her final exam at secretarial school.  The cases Mma. Ramotswa solves are secondary to the humorous goings on in this African town.  Author Alexander McCall Smith is a wonderful story teller.  When you finish this book you can't wait to read the next one.

B001FB4VZS|3.0|The best thing I can say about this seasons is that it was the best way to leave it and never have to watch it again. I will not be back for the 9th season. As a former review said, this season was more of the running in the same place.  Like being on a treadmill, but not going anywhere. Sure they introduced 'doomsday' and the future legion, but one of the things that make Superman what it is is the fantasy.  By trying to make it in the real world of regular people and life, it takes away what it should be. The 'doomsday' thingee was just aweful all season; stringing it along with no climatic finale. Chloe needs to go; Lana needs to go; Lois needs to tone down the attitdue(it's annoying to sound that confident).  Suit up and be done with it.  Maybe every 3rd or 4th episode even. It doesn't need to be for 5 minutes in each episode even.    The new woman who took over for lex was stupid(the character). I never really liked lex anyway; so he's a smart guy who manipulates people and things.  Superman needs to go off into space and fight Mogul(the real comic book guy, not some stupid Smallville facsimile like 'doomsday') and tear some stuff up. I finally got too fed up with the whole destiny thing of Clark.  How long has it been that they don't want to move the character into what he is: Superman.  They don't even want to say the name, they toyed around it in that one episode. Utterlly frustrating.  Tom welling could have been in Transformes: Revenge of the Fallen, but he's stuck on this groundhog day of a show not going anywhere. I guess it's a steady job with good money, but please move on, he can do better. Since The Unit is cancelled, now all I'll have next season is 24 on Fox, Flashpoint on CBS, and Soutland on NBC.  I'm glad this season ended the way it did. The loose ends were not signifianct enough for me to return next season. Bye, bye smallville.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|My wife and I were at one of the MSG concerts, it was one on those rare events that just don't happen anymore. The first part of the concert was OK. I don't mean that as a backhand compliment, but it's what you'd expect from veteran rockers who have played those songs thousands of times before. Instead of an intermission, there are solo versions of Rambling on My Mind and Georgia on My Mind, giving each guy a rest. And then come the darned best 36:20 of music you will ever hear: Little Wing, Voodoo Chile, Can't Find My Way Home, and Dear Mr. Fantasy. I could just see Jimi smiling for the first two. Time was suspended. This set fits right in with, and is a valuable addition to, all of the other performances out there of these songs.
0312944926|2.0|What I mean is, the book talks on and on about how brilliant the protagonists are - a head professor of linguistics, a brilliant cryptographer -- but these are the dumbest smart people ever.  The book is peppered with sentences like \\"he wondered what anyone would want with a ring with writing engraved all over it\\" -- LA DUH!  um, the fact that you are on a secret mission to get the ring for the cryptology department of the NSA? and you can't figure that out?      Sad, I do like Dan Brown, but I'm glad I checked this audiobook out of the library because I would have been upset if I had actually paid for it.  The narrator is decent, though.This book review is of the unabridged audiobook.
B001QB9H10|2.0|I like Jason Statham and have seen almost all of his movies.  He does action movies very well and would have made a great James Bond.  I enjoyed the first two Transporter movies and was expecting to enjoy this one.  Unfortunately, I disliked Transporter 3.    One of the main reasons is the love interest, Natalya Rudakova, is not particularly attractive.  Moreover, her accent got on my nerves almost from the start.  I usually don't mind accents; in fact the love interest in the first Transporter film had an accent and I liked her, but this one got very annoying very quick.    In addition, the plot was too stupid.  Its an action movie and I am not really expecting too much in the way of a plot, but come on!  At one point in the movie, Jason Statham's character opens the bag he is supposed to be transporting and finds phone books and then realizes that the woman accompanying him is in fact the \\"package\\" that he is transporting.  Well duh!  Didn't he watch the first Transporter movie in which a woman was the \\"package\\"?  Its stuff like this that made it difficult to watch - I can suspend disbelief only up to a point.  Also, the gimmick of the movie, in which he wears a bracelet that will explode if he strays too far from his car is very reminiscint of his Crank movies.    Corey Yuen (choreographer for the Matrix) does a good job with the fight scenes, but even those weren't as inventive as the previous Transporter movies.

B001TODCII|5.0|Let there be no mistake - Taken is a no-holds barred, balls-to-the-wall action film.  But it also has first rate acting and a gritty feel to it.  Liam Neeson is well cast as a former covert agent for the U.S. Government who has retired to spend more time with his seventeen year old daughter.  He is unhappy when his daughter decides to embark on a tour of Europe with just a female friend.  His fears are confirmed when the two girls are kidnapped as soon as they land in Paris by mobsters who turn their victims into prostitutes.    Neeson then goes on a one man \\"Dirty Harry\\"-like rampage to track his daughter down.  There are also a few plot twists along the way that keep things interesting.  The only thing that I didn't care for was the fact that Neeson was cast as an American and so had to lose his Irish accent.  They could have had him play an ex-MI5 agent who had married and moved to the USA etc. to explain his accent.  Nevertheless, its still worthy of a 5-star rating.  Now if you'll excuse me, I am going to go buy the extended director's cut version.
0312427573|5.0|This is a great book about a prominent Wall Street financier who has the misfortune of becoming a political football after he is involved in a hit and run accident on a black youth in the Bronx. Wolfe once again captures all of his characters perfectly - all the idiosyncracies are there. How do I know this? Because we see ourselves in these characters. We think many of the same thoughts and only when reading Wolfe do we say, \\"yeah, that's how I am too\\" which may be a humbling experience.     While an interesting plot in its own right, Bonfire of the Vanities is also a piercing commentary on race relations, class relations, and human relations. Wolfe has an uncanny way of getting into each characters head and the reader cannot help but empathize with each one.    This is Wolfe's first fictional work and widely considered his best fiction (of only three though). I have also read I Am Charlotte Simmons and I would argue that Bonfire is not quite as good as Wolfe's novel about a small town girl in prestigious university. Since I have never been to New York City etc I could not connect quite as well with the characters as I could in Charlotte Simmons which was an eerily accurate portrayal of collegiate life.

Oh my, I had completely forgotten what a brilliant writer Ms. Heyer was.  I had forgotten how absolutely wonderful her books were.  This is especially true when you compare her work to some of the stuff gracing the shelves now. Ms. Heyer's work shows that careful craftsmanship (and a respect for the intelligence of her readers) can result in a true gem.  I look foward to renewing my acquaintance with all her work.

0312944098|4.0|I've been reading Jeffrey Archer books for twenty years, and enjoyed this one, but found it to lack the deep and careful character development that was the shining feature of books like Kane & Abel, the Prodigal Daughter, and As the Crow Flies.  The villains are villainous--and deliciously so--while the heroes are heroic--and creatively so--but none of the characters are truly knowable.<br /><br />Archer's creative plot construction is alive and well as he improvises on Dumas, and the book deserves four stars when stacked against generally competitive fiction, but it is not one of the stars of Archer's canon.
0743455967|5.0|I don't like writing long reviews, so I will keep this brief and to the point. This is not a nuts-n-bolts, how-to primer. Although King metes out several valuable technical pointers, the book is really about the craft of writing. If you are a decent writer, this book will validate what you are doing right and give you some insight into what you can do better. Yes, there is a biographical element to the book; however, if you are paying attention you will see that there are gems of wisdom about being an author mixed in with King's reminisces. The main thing I took away from this book was that in order to be a great author, you must become a great story teller. The technical aspects of writing are very important, but they can be learned.

B00005JKMQ|5.0|Ali is a biopic directed by Michael Mann that successfully covers legendary boxing icon Muhammad Ali's benchmarks over a ten-year time frame. The film opens as Cassius Clay prepares for his fight against heavy weight titleholder Sonny Liston. `That man's so ugly, when he sweat... the sweat run backwards off his forehand just to stay away from his face.' The famous `Louisville Lip' opens up as Clay taunts his opponent during a press conference.   From that point on, there is no doubt that Will Smith did a brilliant job in portraying one of the greatest of all time: from the hard work Smith put in at the gym to look and move like Ali, to Smith's emulation of Ali's persona, Smith's talent and achievement is undeniable.   Ali is set in the 1960s, a time of the struggle for civil rights and also a time of war. It is a docudrama that is faithful to historical context. It depicts Ali's at first brotherly relationship with Malcolm X, which slowly deteriorates as X drifts away from the Nation. It also boldly depicts Elijah Muhammad's blatant behavior towards his followers. Ali's wartime struggle is also successfully portrayed as the film dedicates a big part to show his three-year slump after he refuses to join the army on moral grounds.    Some criticized Mann for taking `docudrama liberties' as he depicts the relationship between Ali and Howard Cosell more intimate than it really was and for assuming that Sonny Liston DID apply a substance on his gloves before his fight with Ali. But these are minor `Hollywood touches' that Mann uses to appeal to a wider audience and hardly cause a drag to the great picture.   The only real disappointment of the movie is that it solely focuses on the `greatness' of Ali instead of telling a wholesome life story. It doesn't tell us how Cassius Clay grew up, learnt to box, and gradually made his transformation into Ali. The film also concludes after the `Rumble in the Jungle' fight between Ali and George Foreman; it doesn't deal with Ali's later life after catching Parkinson's.   The power and inspiration of Ali is undisputable, and probably one of the most successful docudrama ever made. `Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee His hands can't hit what his eyes can't see.' No film about The Champ would ever come close to touching Ali.

0575081244|3.0|As I don't quite know what to make of this book, I am resolutely sitting on the fence. The fact that I read all of it means it wasn't horrible, but the fact that I was more than happy to put it down means it wasn't great either. So, for me, Altered Carbon falls somewhere in between.<br /><br />On the positive side, the pace was fast and the ideas were engaging. The main character, Takeshi Kovacs, is a former UN Envoy (sort of like the US Special Forces) who has been \\"stored\\" due to something he did that was either illegal or simply a bad idea. (It is never really clear what he did.) At this point in the future, human beings have worked out how to become functionally immortal. Consciousness is stored in a cortical \\"stack\\" at the back of the neck, which is transferred to a new body when the old one wears out or dies (the process of \\"re-sleeving\\"). In this story, Kovacs is re-sleeved into the body of a former cop, and employed to discover the murderer of a wealthy Meth (someone who can afford several re-sleevings). The twist is that Kovacs has been employed by the victim, who is not happy with the way the police have dealt with his case. The plot goes on from there, with Kovacs marching to the tune of lots of graphic violence, torture, kinky sex, murder, mayhem, and accompanied by numerous beautiful, sexy women who assist/sleep with/try to kill him. (I should point out that though their purpose is to add sex to the plot, these women are significantly smarter than Kovacs. They outwit him at every turn.)<br /><br />Although the basic premise was interesting (I'd LOVE to get re-sleeved just about now), the story line got too convoluted. There were so many characters that it was difficult to keep track of who was doing what to whom and why. Too much was introduced all at once. And, in the long run, none of it seemed particularly relevant. It was just action for its own sake. Adding to the confusion, the dialogue was excessively cryptic. Kovacs hints at startling revelations which you, as the reader, haven't got a clue about. (But, not to worry, on the next page Kovacs is bound to shoot a bunch of people, which will take your mind off the fact that you don't know what's going on.) At times, Kovacs starts to think about his past (these sections are in italics), but again, lacking context, his reminiscing (especially about his father) only served to muddy the waters. I never really understood why Kovacs was so enraged, or why he was so sentimental, or why he cared about strangers he went out of his way for, or why he suddenly went on murder sprees (is there a functioning justice system in the future)? The motivations of the main character were simply too opaque to be convincing.<br /><br />And this was Altered Carbon's primary flaw. It was not convincing. After all that \\"sturm und drang\\" (the conspiracies, the carnage, the huge cast of characters) the resolution to the murder mystery was anticlimactic. (Almost silly, in fact.) And once there was nobody left to kill, Kovacs simply walked off stage. End of story. I imagine he'll be walking back on in the next book, but I won't be in the audience.the reader, haven't got a clue about.

What I will say is that this movie will break your heart.<br />As Benjamin says \\"nothing ever lasts.\\"<br />Cate Blanchett is absolutely exquisite in this role. Brad Pitt also brought great warmth and charm to the portrayal of Benjamin. I was shocked that this movie was directed by David Fincher as it is very different from his previous films. Kudos also to Tilda Swinton who has a wonderful cameo as the wife of a Russian diplomat who has a dalliance with Mr. Button.
B00004R99U|1.0|I've been a fan of the original Pocahontas movie since I was five. I'm nineteen now, and recently came across this movie on YouTube and watched it. I heard about the movie when it first came out when I was eight, but I never saw it, and my mom refused to buy it for me. Now I know why. This film is so horrendous that I'm incapable of considering it canon. I REFUSE to acknowledge this horrible sequel to be a continuation of Pocahontas' story. I know that Disney was historically inaccurate in the first movie and wanted to \\"correct\\" things in the sequel, but by doing so, they angered many people and ruined what made the original movie so great.     The first, and most obvious thing, that I cannot forgive Disney for doing, is ruining the beautiful love story between Pocahontas and John Smith. In the original movie, Pocahontas and John Smith had to actually get to know the other person and overcome obstacles in order to be together. Their love for each other was portrayed so beautifully and passionately, and is rare, even in Disney cinema. Disney heavily implied that Pocahontas and John Smith were meant to be together in the original movie, but with this crappy sequel, they threw that away completely. I hated how in the sequel, the strong, beautiful love Pocahontas and John Smith had for each other meant nothing. Basically, when Pocahontas and John Smith said to each other, \\"I'll always be with you, forever,\\" it was all crap.     Second, Smith was so out of character in this movie, it's ridiculous. In the first movie, his character went from being arrogant and laid back to someone who was passionate, loyal, and who fought for his beliefs. His character developed in the original movie. In the sequel, he's an airhead who only cares for adventure and glory. To say that Pocahontas' influence on him was only temporary is absolutely ludicrous. I was appalled that the creators of this movie chose to regress his character to the point that he was unrecognizable. The John Smith inthe original movie wouldn't have let Pocahontas walk away from him so easily. He would've fought for her and proved to her that he truly loved her. When she decides to go off with John Rolfe in this movie, he doesn't care at all! I was disgusted that the creators butchered his character completely and angry that the creators set him up to look like a jerk so that the audience would justify Pocahontas choosing John Rolfe. Plus, in the beginning of the movie, John Smith is shown in his home in England looking over a map of the New World and making plans to go back there. What the heck, Disney!? If you implied that John Smith planned on going back there, most likely to reunite with Pocahontas, why didn't you go through with it? That was crappy writing and extremely lazy.    Third, Pocahontas is completely out of character as well. In the original movie, she was a strong female character. She knew who she was and was confident, but also very down to earth. She, too, was very passionate about the things she believed in and was determined. Pocahontas genuinely loved John Smith. In the sequel, we see an unsure, confused Pocahontas who does what others tell her. No longer does she think for herself in this movie, instead, letting others think for her, and enabling others to try and make her into a person she's not. I was disgusted that Pocahontas let people walk all over her in the sequel - in the original movie, Pocahontas NEVER did that! When her father told her to stand back so that he could kill John Smith, she told him no. When Nacoma tried to persuade her not to see the man she loved, she did so anyway. While watching this movie, I also saw a huge character regression in Pocahontas. I was furious seeing that the creators of this movie would do that. One of the reasons why I loved the original movie was because Pocahontas was a strong female character, but in this movie, she's just weak and a doormat.     My fourth nitpick with this movie is obviously John Rolfe. I hated his character, not just for coming between John Smith and Pocahontas - there was more as to why I didn't like him. He was cowardly and basically walked with his tail in between his legs the entire movie. Additionally, he was pompous and extremely arrogant, but unlike Smith, his character never developed. He only seemed to like Pocahontas once she became a \\"civilized\\" English woman. He and Pocahontas had no chemistry, no passion, in their relationship. Nothing indicated that they were in love or that they cared for each other deeply. There's no actual romance or love between them. Pocahontas and Rolfe getting together is impulsive and another case of lazy writing.    Next, the creators really screwed up when they let a huge plot hole make way into the sequel. How is Radcliffe not rotting in jail in the sequel when he proved himself to be a fraud and was chained and gagged at the end of the first movie, with full intent of being sent there? Jamestown was his last chance for glory, and he screwed it up big time. Radcliffe knew that he'd lose the King's trust if he screwed up in Jamestown, plus, he physically harmed another human being (John Smith) by shooting him.  How is he roaming as a free man in England after the mess in Jamestown where it was proved that he was a fraud and attempted to attack an entire group of people? When you watch the first movie, Radcliffe's main motive for having the men go to battle wasn't to save John Smith (Even though he motivated everyone to fight that way), it was to see if the Indians had gold.  He had NO part in the second movie, and I had a hard time believing that the King would believe Radcliffe's story over John Smith's, over Thomas' and over all the other settlers there who saw for themselves that Radcliffe was a complete fraud. Why weren't they listened to as well? How Radcliffe gets away with those two things is beyond me. He shouldn't have any place in this movie, and the fact that he's a \\"free man\\" after his crimes in Jamestown is yet another case of bad writing.    Last, but certainly not least, is both the animation and the music. In the original, the animation was gorgeous! I loved the coloring, and how it appeared that time and effort was made into making the characters look just right. Each of the scenes in the movie was breathtaking for its own reasons. Also, the music in the first movie - fantastic, and the musical score was beautiful too. I understand that this movie is a sequel, and has a lower budget, but I still feel like a little more effort could've been made. The animation is sub-par compared to the first, and most of the characters look completely unrecognizable. The songs are horrid and make your ears cringe. It seems like the only reason why there were songs in the movie was just to make it longer.    If you can't already tell, I hate this movie. It ruins a beautiful love story, regresses the two characters from the original movie that we've come to know and love to the point that they're unrecognizable, and delivers lackluster animation and songs that have yet to be memorable and enjoyed. If you're a fan of the original movie, or just in general, don't consider this movie canon. I don't. To me, the end of the first movie left it completely open, but not for a sequel as crappy as this. Personally, I like to think that John Smith made his way back to the New World and reunited with Pocahontas. They marry, have beautiful kids, and live happily ever after.

This book goes WAY beyond just running and the stories within are at times amusing, and at other times mind-boggling.  I found myself thinking ' You can't make this stuff up! '  The characters on this journey are unlike any I've ever read about or known.  Some of the findings are somewhat revolutionary but at the same time may not be for everyone  (barefoot running, running in sandals, consuming certain food products to enhance overall health).  I am looking forward to the response from the medical, science and even running technology fields.   Regardless, highly entertaining and a very fast read for a book this size.

0312370830|3.0|This book is certainly not the best novel set during the Holocaust that I've ever read, but it was pretty good - worth reading.  The subject of Vel d'Hiv and the children is very interesting.  At first I enjoyed the switch between the modern day narration of Julia Jarmond and the Holocaust era voice of Sarah.  However, I soon found that I was eager to read Sarah's chapters and disappointed when I came to Julia's.  By the second half of the book I found Julia's character whiny and annoying.  Without Sarah's chapters to break up Julia's, I realized that I really didn't care about her or her relationship with her husband.  This was just an OK read for me.  It started out very strong in the beginning, but lost momentum in in the second half of the novel.
B001FB55HG|4.0|The film opened a little on the muddy side. A convicted murderer is signing his corpse away to a dying woman representing Skynet.   Huh?  From there it goes uphill in a grim and unrelentingly violent way, if \\"uphill\\" is really an accurate description.  Despite all the fighting, explosions, gunfire and murdering terminators the core of this film defies the standard blockbuster. Many viewers appear to be disappointed that Christian Bale isn't a bigger personality on screen. I think he's perfect for the role because his charisma is not so much in your face but that of a determined man who, through his actions and evident intellect, earns the respect of the other field soldiers. He's like a grimacing dead man who holds THE secret. Sam Worthington's character is the reluctant heart of the film. He's the human being seemingly in spite of himself.    Going into this film I decided to lower my expectations to stave off any serious disappointment.  That attitude seemed warranted but I slowly found myself enjoying the film, appreciating the story as it unfolded. This film shows remaining humanity from a diverse perspective even as bleak as life is. From those fighting the good fight but being beaten down by the unrelenting machines (some hanging on by their fingernails against all odds) to self-exiled scavengers and even a few genuine miscreants, living on the edge of humanity, all are bent on surviving by their wits (or what little they have).  This can also be seen as a coming of age film as Conner discovers that trust in other humans may be the key to all their salvation, hence the title of the film. That trust was earned the hard way and there was still considerable reluctance. Desperate times....    What's refreshing is that the film doesn't rely too much on Bale to carry the film. Bale clearly sublimates his star status to be a fictional but also more realistic icon, a catalyst for hope without being the sole focus of the story. That was a smart move on the part of thedirector even if it pretty much eliminates any chance of this being a summer hit. Instead it's a good film with a good story, better than average acting and a solid re-establishing effort to bring the series back to square one, and actually before square one. The supporting cast was pretty impressive. The FX are very good, somewhat overwhelming but that establishes what the resistance is up against.  The finale was not overtly moving, or even remotely schmaltzy. It was effective and inspiring.  Best of all is the way I keep thinking about this film even as I forget I saw Star Trek.  This is not an Academy Award nominee but it is a solid film that's being beaten up because it had an unexpectedly layered story and a star who decided to be an actor instead.   As always, if you want any chance to enjoy something leave any and all expectations at the door.

I still prefer T2 out of the series, but no disappointments here.
B00000IQMT|4.0|Ten years ago, STAR WARS came back in the form of THE PHANTOM MENACE.  And I was one of the first to go out and purchase the eagerly awaited soundtrack by John Williams.    Needless to say I was in awe!  Even after I saw the movie and was subsequently disappointed, I was still enamored by this music.  Although \\"Duel of the Fates\\" felt a little out of place in the Star Wars universe (don't get me wrong, it's an awesome piece of music), it eventually grew on me, especially after getting incorporated into the succeeding prequel scores, ATTACK OF THE CLONES and REVENGE OF THE SITH.    I still think the soundtrack would have been improved if John Williams had used more of the Tatooine themes from A NEW HOPE (perhaps excerpts from \\"Binary Sunset\\" or \\"Mos Eisley Spaceport\\").    But after ten years, it's much more Star Wars-ish to me now than it once was.  It's still a fun musical adventure, full of excitement and wonder.    Par for the course for John Williams.

The remixed versions are interesting at first to listen to, but they certainly are not any better.  In some songs, it's much worse.  Yes it's good to hear Vedder more clearly but in so many songs the guitar solos are pulled back and get drowned out by other instrumentation.  Other times Vedder sounds so separate from the music that it's almost like he's singing in a closet.

B001SMC91M|5.0|I first encountered Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears at the Austin Chronicle Hot Sauce Festival last August in Texas.  It was a hot day--up in the '90s--and the heat was compounded by the scorching hot sauces that vendors were offering as samples.  As I was waiting in line, BJL started a set.  It was perfect.  Great rocking soul complements great hot sauce, and BJL brought it.  Even though it must have been 95 degrees, the band was blazing along at full throttle and intensity.  This CD captures some of that heat.  If you're into James Brown, then you've got to hear this.  If you're into great music, then you've got to hear this.  And catch them live if they swing through your town.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />------<br /><br />Some music critics at WXPN in Philadelphia, among other places, have made this a top 10 album of 2009 pick.  I wholeheartedly agree.  Great band.  Check them out.

I have lost 15 pounds. Let's just say, dear hubby thinks I am \\"hot\\" (well, even more so than before).

0385340575|5.0|Everyone who has read Lee Child's Jack Reacher books has a favorite. Mine happens to be the newly published GONE TOMORROW, and there are a number of reasons for this. For one, the novel is set in New York City, where Reacher, at least for me, seems to be at his best. Another is that the always self-assured Reacher reveals a side and quantity to his wit and wisdom heretofore unseen. A third is the nuggets of information about New York that are dropped appropriately and generously throughout the book. And then, of course, there is the story, which is perhaps the most interesting and complex tale with which Child has graced us to date.    GONE TOMORROW begins with Reacher on the subway, undertaking the first leg of a journey to take him out of town. We learn soon enough that his entire reason for being in the city was to visit some Bleecker Street clubs and listen to music. But his travels are interrupted when he spots a woman who meets almost all the criteria for a suicide bomber (the criteria list, if you haven't seen it, is worth the price of admission all by itself). When he approaches her and attempts to quietly and civilly ascertain her intentions, she shoots herself. Suddenly, Reacher is a person of interest in the eyes of a number of different groups of people.    First are the two officers investigating the death of the woman, whose name is Susan Mark. The police are almost immediately followed by a trio of nameless federal agents from an unidentified federal agency. Next are a quartet of gentlemen from a private investigator's office that does not exist, as Reacher soon finds out. Then there is the brother of the unfortunate Mark, a cop from a small town in New Jersey who cannot believe that his sister committed suicide. While each group seeks information from Reacher, it is Reacher who manages to extract a crumb, a thread, or a nugget of information regarding Mark, and the events that led to her killing herself on a New York subway train, alone and far fromhome.    Reacher soon ferrets out two vital pieces of information: Mark knew something about John Sansom, an up-and-coming Senatorial candidate from North Carolina, and she was in New York to meet with a woman named Lila Hoth, a foreign national who was waiting for that information, supposedly with benign and benevolent intent. Everyone (except for the police and Mark's brother) is lying to Reacher, as they all think that Reacher knows more than he actually does. What develops is that Mark was in possession of a memory stick containing documentation of an incident that occurred decades before and could cause some earth-shaking, and world-changing, embarrassment to a number of people for different reasons.    Reacher, for his part, is initially compelled to find out why Mark killed herself in front of him. His private investigation leads him from Manhattan to Washington, D.C. and back again, down streets that are on and off the beaten path and into buildings that few if anyone ever notice. Everybody is playing for keeps; when Reacher learns the what, the why and the who behind Mark's suicide, however, the matter becomes intensely personal for him, and he unleashes himself in a manner rarely seen thus far in the series.    There are some nice touches throughout GONE TOMORROW, brilliant in their simplicity. A loner who is always on the move (though not on the run), Reacher has let technology pass him by. One scenario involves Reacher needing to avoid a spot of trouble by turning off the ringer on a cellular phone, something he does not know how to do. Another displays his unfamiliarity with playing a DVD on a computer, a mildly amusing vignette that sets up a stark contrast for what follows. Whatever Reacher lacks in technological familiarity, however, he more than makes up for in urban knowledge. His apparently encyclopedic knowledge of the city, encompassing information that is useful as well as that which only seems to be trivial, serves him well, especially near the end of the book, when Reacher pulls off a neat trick that had me howling as much from its execution as from its truly brilliant setup. Then there is the ticking clock of the plot, which starts at the beginning and gets louder and louder, even as there is some misdirection as to what the clock actually is, and where.    The best part of GONE TOMORROW, though, is the mystery behind all that occurs, a puzzle that Reacher slowly and painstakingly unravels while on his way to a climax that is stunning in its violence yet brutally satisfying. Both Reacher and Child are at their best here.        --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
0307346617|5.0|Is this book really five star?  No..., but as far as a kick butt zombie book goes, it is all five stars.  The book is a realistic, if that term applies, appraisal of how the world would react to an undead pandemic.  The author brilliantly uses brief short stories from various characters to navigate through the plot line.  I blew through this book in a day, but it is written so you could easily read a few papges, put the book down, and then pick it up again in a few weeks and start right where you left off and still be able to follow along.  Many other reviews have been written of World War Z so I'll keep this one short.  If you are a zombie apocalypse fan, well, just say you aren't REALLY a true fan if you haven't read this book.
1439138311|4.0|Although it's a relatively slight work when compared to its prize-winning predecessor, THE MASTER, a brilliant treatment of the life of Henry James, the latest novel from Ireland's Colm Tóibín is a warm and finely observed tale of one young immigrant woman's coming of age in the America of the early 1950s.    At the suggestion of Father Flood, a New York parish priest, Eilis Lacey, a young woman from the village of Enniscorthy, County Wexford (Tóibín's own hometown), leaves her widowed mother and older sister in 1951 to make a new home in Brooklyn. It seems she has little to lose, abandoning a menial job in a grocery store and facing the chance to emerge from the shadow of her poised and accomplished sibling.    Tóibín recounts in gruesome detail Eilis's wretched weeklong ocean passage in a cramped third-class cabin. She takes up residence in a Brooklyn rooming house inhabited by five other young women and owned by the officious and opinionated Mrs. Kehoe, herself an immigrant from County Wexford. At first Eilis is overwhelmed by the novelty of her surroundings, in which \\"each moment appeared to bring some new sight or sensation or piece of information,\\" but her fascination with the new world soon is overtaken by intense homesickness, especially for her older sister Rose: \\"She was nobody here. It was not just that she had no friends and family; it was rather that she was a ghost in this room, in the streets on the way to work, on the shop floor. Nothing meant anything.\\" In a gorgeous passage, Tóibín describes how Eilis is both sustained and tortured by thoughts of her Irish home, of an \\"early evening in October walking with her mother down by the prom in Enniscorthy, the Slaney River glassy and full, and the smell of leaves burning from somewhere close by, and the daylight going slowly and gently.\\"    Several months after she is settled into her job as a clerk at Bartocci's Department Store on Fulton Street, Eilis enrolls in night classes at Brooklyn College, where she studies assiduously for her bookkeeping certificate, her dream eventually to attain an office job. At a parish hall dance she meets Tony Fiorello, a handsome, earnest young plumber from Bensonhurst, and the mutual attraction, if not instantaneous, soon becomes obvious. Before long their relationship settles into a comfortable pattern: Tony \\"collects\\" her from her night class every Thursday; they attend the parish hall dance on Friday and take in a movie on Saturday night. Tony's feelings for Eilis grow more quickly than do hers for him, but Tóibín writes movingly and perceptively of the young woman's deepening affection for her uncomplicated companion.    In the midst of this intimate tale, Tóibín subtly alludes to the changes coming to the world of post-war America: the first \\"colored\\" customers at Bartocci's, the arrival of television, and the early days of Long Island's suburban boom, as Tony and his brothers dream of building family homes, and eventually a construction business, there. Eilis's comfort in this strange new world grows alongside her attachment to Tony, as he takes her to the crowded beach at Coney Island and to Ebbets Field, where he vainly tries to rouse her interest in the game of baseball that's incomprehensible to her.    When a family tragedy causes Eilis to return to Enniscorthy, she encounters Jim Farrell, a young pub owner for whom she develops feelings that rival the ones she holds for Tony, and she must decide whether she'll return to her roots in the sleepy village or to the new life she has carved out for herself in America. \\"It made her feel strangely as though she were two people,\\" Eilis thinks as she reflects on the choice she inevitably must make, \\"one, who had battled against two cold winters and many hard days in Brooklyn and fallen in love there, and the other who was her mother's daughter, the Eilis whom everyone knew, or thought they knew.\\" Tóibín resolves that conflict with the same subtlety and mastery thatcharacterizes the rest of the novel.    In his quietly perceptive prose, Colm Tóibín effortlessly captures the duality that lies at the heart of Eilis Lacey's story. BROOKLYN unassumingly offers both a classic saga of an immigrant coming to terms with life in her new land and an equally appealing story of one young woman's grasp of a hard-won maturity.        --- Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg (mwn52@aol.com)

I don't know if its how Metallica does it, but there is WAY too much distortion in their songs I absolutly hated the whole album. This is my opinion, but there really was no song all I could hear was BzZzZzZzZ and thats really annoying, and being a musician, its a little hard to play along when you can't hear all the instruments in the song.

(I'm purposely overlooking 2005's \\"Everlasting Love,\\" a throw away album if there ever were one.)  I'm not quite sure what I expected, but this odd, mismatched m&eacute;lange of styles wasn't it.  Williams was moving towards smooth jazz a while ago, but now that recording has pretty much become a hobby for her, identity is something she seems to be having some trouble with.  Is she the new Anita Baker or Natalie Cole doing the standards thing?  Is she the kindler, gentler Queen Latifah of \\"Trav'lin' Light\\" or a Basia-style singer of pseudo-Latin pop?  She's all of them on this album, which means she none of them.  Which might not be quite so bad if the material (the standards aside) weren't so utterly forgettable.  There's certainly no question that Ms. Williams has talent; I guess I just wish she'd do more with it.  Personally, I would have loved something a little more hip, with some of the old edge (not that Williams ever had much to begin with). And while I wouldn't expect that, at this point in her career, \\"The Real Thing\\" would be \\"The Right Stuff,\\"  it's discouraging that so much of it is...well, wrong.

If there is anything not to like its the endless prarde of family member suspects --but don't worry in the end for the story its not important. Roll with it.

By focusing attention on interests and away from egos, I find the methods it introduces border on the therapeutic. This is not a bad thing, since every negotiation is the product of personal interaction. Addressing the confounding effects of personality and ego directly simply makes sense.    Getting To Yes is the only book I consistently wish I had read sooner. It was first recommended to me in an undergraduate political science class. Since then I have re-read it every few years, and gifted it on numerous occasions -- including 3x this year alone. The last occasion was my extremely gifted niece's 10th birthday.     The clarity of expression and the usefulness of the principles described make it suitable for any high school student.

Acting shout-outs in particular to the JenBen couple and Ginnifer Goodwin and Justin Long.  Jennifer Connelly, even in a film that may not perhaps be Oscar material, shows us that no matter what she does, she herself is Oscar material every moment she inhabits a frame. I felt her pain, especially (spoiler hint alert) how she focused on the ciggies.  Been there.  We really do that.  The writing and situations are so realistic we have all been there.

Max goes on a wild adventure in which he tames monsters and becomes their king, and yet ultimately needs to return to someone who \\"loves him best of all\\". This story is also available on DVD from Scholastic - complete with behind the scenes interviews with Maurice Sendak. The illustrations are top notch - so carefully and beautifully done. Mr. Sendak explains in the DVD that the monsters were originally going to be wild horses but he couldn't draw a convincing enough horse, so he decided to make monsters instead! He also says they were based on his aunts and uncles, who were terribly intimidating to him as a child! Highly recommended.

This author's popularity is enormous, as I realized when someone stopped me at lunch and mentioned that he had noticed me reading this book.<br /><br />That should have been a tip-off. Anything enormously popular has got to be worthless.<br /><br />That said, the book is horrid, of absolutely no interest. Waste of paper, ink, binding materials, cardboard, transportation costs, and air. I read three or four chapters and that was it for me. I took the book back to the store and got a refund.<br /><br />What is the point? There is nothing in this book of the slightest interest.<br /><br />Disposable trash.<br /><br />Skip this.<br /><br />For those of who who don't understand what 'useful' means, it does NOT mean that you agree with the review.
0064430227|5.0|This is probably the first children's book I purchased as an adult, as a gift for friends. I've since read it to my preschool age children, and they've enjoyed it as well. Harold comes across some sticky - even scary - situations - in some of the Purple Crayon stories. But his imagination and ingenuity always see him through. A wonderful fantasy for children, who after all live in a world in which they have very little say, but many opportunities to be creative and use their imagination. An important part of any child's library.
B00005NKKY|5.0|Bookends is far and away one of the best, if not the best, album that Simon & Garfunkel ever released. Their sounds on this recording are phenomenal; the remastering job is superlative. This is a must-have CD for any Simon & Garfunkel fan; and we get two bonus tracks here that were not on the original record album release. Great!<br /><br />The album begins with the \\"Bookends Theme.\\" The guitar work stuns me with its beauty; it's all THAT good. \\"Bookends Theme\\" is a strong number with which to open the album, too. \\"Save The Life Of My Child\\" features great guitar and percussion work as Simon & Garfunkel perform this to perfection--and beyond! This is solid proof that these two masterful artists could handle complex tempo and key changes like the true pros they were and still remain. I'm very impressed. \\"America\\" is a much more mellow number with Simon & Garfunkel harmonizing faultlessly; \\"America\\" has a terrific flavor to it and the music fits in perfectly with their vocals. How's about that woodwind playing, too?<br /><br />\\"Voices Of Old People\\" isn't exactly my favorite number on this album; but I can tell it has artistic value. It's just not my style; but many people will like this nonetheless. \\"Old Friends\\" stuns me with its beauty. \\"Old Friends\\" sports a lush musical arrangement and it all holds it own very well. The \\"Bookends Theme\\" comes back to complete the cycle of life with people growing old from being very young; and that's special.<br /><br />\\"Fakin' It\\" has a mellow rock sound that strikes me with its beauty; this is Simon & Garfunkel at their best and just one listen will tell you why. They perform this without ever letting go of a superfluous note--impressive! \\"Fakin' It\\" is one of my favorite numbers on the entire album; it's really quite strong and the music fits beautifully with their vocalizing. In addition, \\"Punky's Dilemma\\" sports a mellow flavor that showcases the talents of Simon & Garfunkel; Punky's Dilemma\\" is indeed somewhat unusual--but it works every step of the way. Of course, \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" is an extremely popular number; all the stars in all the heavens were aligned in just the right places when Simon & Garfunkel wrote this tune. \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" worked well in the film \\"The Graduate;\\" and it's a classic ballad that will always remain incredibly special in its own right.<br /><br />\\"A Hazy Shade Of Winter\\" uses the percussion and guitars well; even the brass sounds perfect! \\"At The Zoo\\" uses creative percussion while Simon & Garfunkel turn this out like champs! The guitars in \\"At The Zoo\\" couldn't have been any better sounding, either. We then get two bonus numbers, \\"You Don't Know Where Your Interest Lies\\" and \\"a demo version of \\"Old Friends.\\" Simon & Garfunkel make these memorable with their impeccable delivery; and that's grand.<br /><br />Simon & Garfunkel could never be forgotten; they gave us so much and we are all better off for their sharing their talents with us. I highly recommend this album for their fans especially since it has two bonus tracks. This is equally good as a starter CD for people just getting into Simon & Garfunkel.the way.

B000LPS4BQ|5.0|This movie totally rocks! I've always loved Scooby-Doo since i was a kid (I'm 21 now) and I remembered watching the original Scooby-Doo Where Are You episodes, The Scooby-Doo movies, The Scooby and Scrappy-Doo show, A Pup Named Scooby Doo (which I absolutely loved!) and the recent animated movies. Oh, plus What's New Scooby Doo! I remember, when I first heard of the release of this movie in 2002, I was really excited! One of everyone's favorite cartoon been brought to life! I was even more excited to hear that Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. would be the leads in the movie as Daphne and Fred. Their previous movies were mostly really cool, and neither of them are bad on the eye (they're both GORGEOUS!). When I saw the movie, I was blown away! This movie was PERFECT! Really fun and funny, action-packed, filled with jokes and also pretty scary. That was even more than I really expected. WAY MORE!     The CGI Scooby was top-notch (making him look like a real dog, making him cartoony and funny at the same time and leaving him intact as the actual cartoon must've been really hard, BUT THEY PULLED IT OFF 100%    The characters, Shaggy, Daphne, Fred and Velma, played by Matthew Lillard, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Linda Cardellini were dead-on their cartoon counterparts. To me, this cast was perfect, they really felt like a group of friends (well, Sarah and Freddie were engaged during this [and they have such chemistry!] and Matthew had appeared with Freddie in other flicks and are really good friends). I think this cast actually made me like the characters even more. Matthew Lillard IS Shaggy, no questions. Linda Cardellini IS Velma (and she even made her quite sexy) Freddie Prinze Jr. IS SO Fred (quite funny performance by the way). But Sarah Michelle Gellar completely blowed me away! She made Daphne so much better than the actual cartoon character. That ain't an easy feat. I liked how she gave Daphne that edge and spunk, while still lookingcompletely stunning in 6'' inch high pink go-go boots.    Everything in this movie was REALLY WELL MADE. The CGI effects, the sets (HUGE and IMPRESSIVE), the costumes (I LOVE how they made Mystery Inc. look, they seemed cooler, more modern, but still retaining their cartoonish charm...    I really can't say enough of this movie! I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT! I saw it in theaters, bought it on VHS, then DVD, seen it like 5+ times and still love it! I can't wait to own it on Blu-Ray and see how it looks!    This movie has everything= Cartoon mega-hit brought to life even better than the original, FUNNY, WITTY, COLORFUL, ACTION-PACKED, GREAT CHARACTERS and PERSONALIZATION, HORROR and so MUCH MORE!! That's SCOOBY DOO! Gotta love it!
B0025X4OYI|5.0|Talk about a CD that showcases Ray Charles' incredible talent! He could sing, play piano, arrange music, write and more. These country and western songs shine bright when Ray Charles performs them with so much genuine emotion. I really love to hear Ray sing; he could do a lot with that voice of his. This also marks the first time that the songs from volume two are on CD; and this is great for Ray Charles fans and anyone who enjoys high quality control country and western timeless ballads.<br /><br />\\"Bye Bye Love\\" is dynamic and Ray bats this straight out of the ballpark with a flawless musical arrangement. This is one awesome starting number for this CD! Other numbers that shine bright would have to include \\"You Don't Know Me\\" with that incredible arrangement while Ray sings this to perfection--and beyond; \\"Half As Much\\" with that incredibly sophisticated sound; the energetic \\"Just A Little Lovin'\\" with its fine drums and percussion; \\"Born To Lose\\" which was one of Ray's best known hits; \\"It Makes No Difference Now\\" showcasing Ray's incredible sense of timing; \\"You Win Again\\" with those fantastic strings and that chorus backing up Ray; the poignant \\"Careless Love;\\" \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" which is another of Ray's best known hits; \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" with a very creative arrangement that Ray aces as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing; \\"Don't Tell Me Your Troubles\\" with Ray handling complex tempo and key changes like the pro he was and always will be; \\"Take These Chains From My Heart\\" which features Ray squarely front and center as he sings this beautifully; \\"Your Cheating Heart\\" with Ray's excellent diction bolstering his performance and \\"Hang Your Head In Shame\\" which ends the CD leaving me wanting more.<br /><br />It's no secret that Ray Charles was a giant amongst giants; he will never be forgotten. I'll treasure this album for years to come; it's a great Ray Charles album and it's a fine CD to add to your collection.

1416562605|4.0|In a book-length correspondence to the head of the Chinese government, Balram writes his views on the changing landscape of the global economy and the personal experiences on which his thoughts are based.  His ideas a progressive and it must be his upbringing within the world of organized crime in India that has given him his unique perspective.  He uses his experiences as evidence to bolster his credibility.      Aravind Adiga won the Man Booker Prize in 2008 for The White Tiger.  I use the Man Booker Prize nominees list every year as a great source for my to-read pile.  Sometimes I agree with the chosen winner, sometimes I do not.  I have not read each book that was nominated in 2008 yet, but I was not disappointed with the Prize going to The White Tiger.  I have never read a book like this before and I thought it to be very creative.  This was a departure from what I normally read and that was as refreshing as it was frustrating.  But I was pleased to see an author write in such a way to better display the main character's personality.  I think all of this speaks to why Adiga was only the fourth author awarded the Booker Prize for a debut novel.

0393312836|5.0|Beyond the detailed violence (very well written on Burgess' part) I REALLY enjoyed this book especially the slang (Nasdat). A Clockwork Orange is a dark and humorous tale which when given a chance expresses deep insight on government, free will, moral choice, and much more. I can't really think of much more to say except that if you are considering seeing the movie, read the book first...in my opinion the book is much better. Also, don't let anyone's tales of the violence depicted be a reason for not reading the book, because beyond that, is so much more.     A real horrorshow book. : )
B00169N0BK|5.0|It works as advertised. Support is excellent includin a downloadable video, which is one of the best ive seen.
B00005B1W5|3.0|I stopped everything and put this DVD in the player just as soon as the postman brought it today.  I expected to be captivated, just like I was with the Acropolis DVD.  Unfortunately, this is one of those concerts that I can listen to a couple of songs and then go about my business.  I really liked Adagio and Tribute...and that's about it.  In the Acropolis concert, Yanni's music is crisp and clear and beautiful.  In the Taj Mahal/Forbidden City concert, Yanni's music is loud and busy...leaving the listener with very little opportunity to appreciate any of the components.  At one time, with the long trumpet solo, it was just another piece of jazz...IMHO.  And what's with the go-go girls?  Now and then a voice or two is okay...but continually using the girls and their synchronized moves?  No thanks...it shouldn't take that to get Yanni's music across.  The new conductor was very bland compared to Shardad, the new percussionist was pretty good,  Ric was great, of course.  The new keyboardist was spectacular.  And I really missed Charlie...

0312945973|3.0|I guess I'm just not enough of a \\"manly man\\" to appreciate Mr. Smith's rapturous descriptions of slaughtering animals which abound in this otherwise very readable actioner set in the Egypt of the pharoahs.  The novel starts out with a very long, detailed and gory account of a savage hippopotamus hunt.  I managed to get through that only to encounter Smith being similiarly thrilled by his recounting of the massacre of an oryx herd.  By the time we got to further technicolor exultations about the destruction of elephants to plunder their ivory - complete with horses being impaled on tusks - I gave up.  Give me good old human-to-human cruelty any time, but please leave the Great White Hunter shtick out.  This is essentially my only comment about this novel.  Quite ordinary in conception and execution - not surprised it was big on the New York Times bestseller list.  If you have a soft heart animal-wise (bleeding, some might say), do not subject yourself to the obviously delighted Mr. Smith's detailing of the gruesome destruction of wild animals.  How many parts of a book can you skip over and still consider it a good read?  Teddy Roosevelt I'm not.  Please leave the carcasses and mounted antlers elsewhere.  TYVM
B00000DHRZ|1.0|When I heard \\"Come Out and Play\\" in the middle 1990s bands like [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nirvana]], [[ASIN:B000002B86 Silverchair]] and [[ASIN:B000002B9P The Presidents of the United States of America]] were testing the faith I had as a child in commercial radio but was rapidly losing. At first, I thought the song was by an Australian band (whose name I will not mention) I had read about but never heard (later a familiar tale for me) and it was only after I had really come to detest the Offspring that I realised \\"Come Out and Play\\" had been thier first hit single.<br /><br />During the 1990s I had a stereotyped image of \\"alternative\\" music as loud, tuneless noise whose critical praise I could never grasp (not at the time did I care). If you want to keep that image, the Offspring is exactly the band to hear. Their songs, all along, tend towards the inanely catchy at the expense of the slightest substance, in exactly the same manner as bands like [[ASIN:B000005S0Q Slade]] and [[ASIN:B00000E78O Gary Glitter]] did in the early 1970s for audiences who could not resist a song like \\"Rock and Roll\\" or \\"Cum on Feel Tha Noize\\".<br /><br />If anything, the Offspring were sillier than those terrible glam bands, and though their sound was harder and more emotional the manner in which their songs would hit one's brain with a terrible aftertaste is quite unlike most previous pop music. The awful tunelessness and lack of harmony can be seen on \\"Why Don't You Get A Job\\", which could be a rewrite of the justly deplored \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" from a few years before. When they really move close to metal on \\"Have You Ever\\", Dexter Holland sounds as if he is straining to be heard, whist \\"Staring at the Sun\\" is just a terrible punk pop number. The way in which Dexter Holland uses obscenities as humour makes a band who pay with a self-conscious childishness that no doubt appeals to the many angry young kids in American and even Australian cities. It does not, however, detract from the fact that self-conscious childishness makes for the worst possible music because it clearly shows the musicians involved feel only on the shallowest possible emotional level. The Offspring like the spoilt childish person I have always been owing to autistic problems - only they will not even try to discuss their problems with a sympathetic counsellor and instead make a living out of acting this role. The problems the Offspring sing about are not deep or even personal, but relate to hated Others who become criticised without reason or feeling.<br /><br />The Offspring, despite their history on an independent label, sound on radio like a band manufactured for children to prevent them from growing up. Anyone with a serious interest in music will know that strategy is the worst possible one to make music that can be easily listened to or remembered.childishness makes for the worst possible music because it clearly shows the musicians involved feel only on the shallowest possible emotional level.

0891419195|5.0|While reading this book I could feel the heat, and the sweat running between my toes when Sledge described the climate on Peleliu.  One could sense that he was there in combat fighting right next to him. I could smell the rotting human flesh and see the maggots clinging to their clothing while he fought on Okinawa. If you enjoy reading about the war in the South Pacific, this is a must read. From what I have read, no one has ever written a more accurate day to day account of the hell that the American Soldiers experienced on Peleliu.

B000002VTE|5.0|The third album by Jason Pierce's project Spiritualized, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE ARE FLOATING IN SPACE is a therapeutic record, meant to help Pierce get over a doomed relationship and offer some solace to listeners out there. Indeed, the remarkable design of the album, worth carefully admiring before playing the record, has it matching a box of medicinal tablets (the limited edition went one step further by placing each of the 12 tracks on its own individually wrapped disc).<br /><br />The album consists in the main of three types of material: droning rock guitars, grand string or choir arrangements, and free jazz-like jamming. A few tracks are dominated by one particular sound (\\"Come Together\\" the first, \\"Stay with Me\\" by the second, and \\"Cop Shoot Cop\\" by the third). Generally, however, Pierce has created his songs from massive layering of elements that reconcile elements one might consider heterogenous. Underneath the rigid structure of most tracks, there's a guitar or saxophone line that is complete pandemonium. The contribution of the Balanescu Quartet, the London Community Gospel Choir and Dr. John give the album a memorable grandeur, and Pierce merits praise for keeping the tradition of Phil Spector \\"wall of sound\\" production alive.<br /><br />I come back to LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE ARE FLOATING IN SPACE quite often and can recommend it to listeners looking for psychadelic music of recent times.recent times.

Hamish this may be fun to make for you but as a music fan and consumer of such, this non artistic direction sucks just like it did for the Boston and Vertigo Chicago concert, it drives me crazy.  Bono, The Edge, Adam and Larry do you ever see these videos and do you have any imput?? Fans want to see the Band playing and singing the songs long enough to focus your eyes on the next shot.  Buy this set but be prepared to get dizzy. Thanks again Hamish.

B00003CXAW|5.0|I am a huge fan of stop motion effects and what better example of this process than King Kong! Harryhausen would take over as king of Stop Motion, but without Kong, there would be no Harryhausen!<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies of all time and the DVD is nothing short of spectacular! Not being old enough to have seen this iconic film in a theater, I was finally able to watch it in my home theater on a 10 foot screen! As the movie began I was amazed how clear the print was and I noticed little things I had never seen before. This is pretty amazing considering I've seen this film over 100 times. The sound is mono, but it's very clear and would be hard to really improve on this. The film holds up amazingly well and is the definitive giant monster movie!<br /><br />King Kong is the ultimate adventure film and I doubt it will ever be surpassed. One of the most intriguing things about this film is that Kong is a rampaging monster and never steps out of character, but in the end when he's being attacked on top the Empire State building, you can't help but feel sorry for him! Never has an eighteen inch puppet ever evoked so much sympathy! It truly is a masterpiece and I can't even imagine never seeing this film!?<br /><br />The second disc in loaded with wonderful bonus features including two long and interesting documentaries. I bought the box set which includes the original Mighty Joe Young and Son of Kong on separate discs, which are sold separately for those who only want certain films in this set.<br /><br />All three films are great examples of Stop Motion, so it's an essential set for fans of the genre. The set includes the same 2 disc special edition of King Kong and two other classic stop motion films! All the films have been re-mastered and look better than ever!<br /><br />I know that many were disappointed that the original \\"spider\\" sequence was not included on the Kong set, but the footage has yet to be unearthed! They did the next best thing and it is interesting to see the re-constructed scene.<br /><br />I had reviewed this film several years ago, but somehow it disappeared!?ructed scene.

0201633612|4.0|First let me start with the good points about this book.  This book absolutely rocks in terms of ways in which you can write a beautiful piece of code. The authors have picked up the best recipes which are time tested to create a book which should help everyone from a beginner to an expert. The book has been written for C++ programmers and requires some amount of experience in object oriented programming (hence java and c# programmers are fine too).    The bad points are:  It's old. The current and only edition came out in 1997. A second edition is long overdue. A lot has changed in the software methodologies since then. JAVA already incorporates a lot of things that are mentioned in this book. An example in point is the iterator pattern. Hence, a better book for JAVA programmers would be JAVA Design Patterns Explained or Head First Design Patterns.    Still a pretty great book...

B0018LX9T4|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best films that I own. There are those who have reviewed this and said it was slow and boring but obviously didn't look beneath the surface and see the true beauty of it.True BDSM is not about throwing down and having sex every two seconds, if you wanted that, then go watch some teen sex comedy crap.This was about the relationship between a submissive and a dominant.It takes time to build trust with a partner in a relationship such as this and I think that film portrayed it brilliantly.This is a film the definitely deserves 5 stars for accurately portraying a D/S relationship.It wasn't overly graphic or silly with over usage of whips and chains and such which is what I think alot of people were expecting out of this.In my opinion, this is what true love is.What is pain without the pleasure?Boring.
B001RZC4VA|5.0|This album is amazing.  The saxaphone mixed with the 2-string slide bass makes for a unique and awesome sound.

It's one of those albums you can listen to all the way through and never skip a song.      I saw them on the second stage of the H.O.R.D.E.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is fantastic, it has provided countless hours of play for our family.  We purchased it as a Christmas gift and the kids played almost non-stop for the entire holiday season...in fact, there was usually a line to get into the next game.  If you have more than 4 people that want to play, tandems work very well.  This can be especially helpful for younger kids that don't quite understand strategies as well.  When we played, kids and adults of all ages joined in and had a blast.  We went ahead and immediately bought the 5-6 player extension so more people could play.<br /><br />Each setup is totally unique, which makes each game totally unique.  Strategy (and some luck) is required in order to be successful, but there are a number of strategies that can used to win the game.  The corners of some of the cardboard pieces are starting to show a bit of wear, but it should be able to hold up for quite a bit longer.  I highly recommend this game - you will not be disappointed!
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I read this book recently and found this movie to be a terrible adaptation of the book. As other reviewers said, Anne was too old and tired looking to represent the Anne of the book. While she had \\"lost her bloom\\" she seemed to get it back during the course of the story. She also displayed a subtle strength which I did not see in the character at all. Obviously the movie cannot go into the same depth as the book but I found at times they movie veered from the book too much changing the characters in ways that did not do the story justice. In the opera scene, Anne chases down Fredrich desparately..this did NOT happen in the book -she held her composure at all times.  I am pretty forgiving of books to movies but this one was just plain poor. I terrible disappointment.

Bruno, the main character, will lead you and through his eyes you will witness how cruel the human being can be, and how what comes around goes around<br />It does not contain cruel images though, but you will see the tragedy of a nazi camp from a boy's perspective
B001GM28HO|5.0|This is the best CD I have purchased in a long time.  \\"Just Dance\\", \\"Poker Face\\" and \\"LoveGame\\" are all smash hits.  I like other pop artists like Britney, Gwen, Madonna, etc. but have rarely liked one of their CDs from start to finish.  Even the bonus track on the album (\\"I Like it Rough\\") is quite good.  People who are turned off by lyrics that center around having fun, partying, money, sex and fame should definately avoid this CD. Awesome debut from young Lady GaGa!
B001EYGOEM|4.0|This is my daughter:    I really liked the lyrics!!!!! But it could get boring after a while. Certain songs have similar tunes, but they are all still VERY good!!!!!! Love Story is my favorite! Hey Stephen is also VERY good and something I can relate to. You Belong With Me is very good, I love the lyrics. And the tune to fearless, sounds well, FEARLESS!!!!!!!!! I absolutely love Taylor's sweet voice, and I especially think The Best Day suits her voice. It's very sweet and I know my parents would love it.  YAY!
B002B4A94A|4.0|There is no doubt about this year in the way of albums that are out. most of them have felt like you've wasted your money on something that felt like garbage. It has been very sad. Nevertheless, there are some artists that have really known how to make a great album time and time again. That absolutely has been the case with Vanessa Williams. It has been 4 years since her last album, 2005's Everlasting Love, and she has proven that she has more life in her music and acting than ever. With the massive success of her work on Ugly Betty, Vanessa has been introduced boldly to a whole new generation of fans. Now she is back to sing her soulful little heart out again, and this time it definitely is a winner.<br /><br />Vanessa Williams 2009 album The Real Thing is definitely a well-rendered and delightful return to form for Vanessa's sultry voice. The album contains a nice and simple mix of quiet storm, R&B, Jazz and Latin rhythms. The songs here really work very well for Vanessa, and shows how much she has delivered well. The album includes a lot of great tracks including the sultry and seductive Breathless, the Jazz Standard Lazy Afternoon, as well as other great songs like the title track The Real thing, and the easy and mellow Hello Like Before. Sadly though there are a few disadvantages with the album. The first is that it is very short, and leaves hard core listeners going wild for more. The second disadvantage is that I was hoping for a bit more variety in the songs, considering there could've been a few more upbeat songs to the mix. Still, Vanessa carries through on the album very well, by letting her simple and soulful voice carry through the album beautifully.<br /><br />While there really haven't been very many albums that have worked this past year, Vanessa Williams still knows how to make a album work well. If you haven't yet heard a Vanessa Williams song, or if you are a hard core fan of Ugly Betty, than this would be a great download for your MP3 Player.  So than you'll finally hear why Vanessa Williams is still The Real Thing for over 20 years as a singer.<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Mastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B+nally hear why Vanessa Williams is still The Real Thing for over 20 years as a singer.

0756405890|5.0|How do I begin?  Rarely have I been as captivated by a novel as I was with `The Name of The Wind'.  Another reviewer mentioned this, and I have to agree.  We often spend too much time with our favorite authors that we miss out on incredible writing by new authors.<br /><br />It's unbelievable that this is a first novel.  The writing is beautiful and harsh and lyrical.  The story of Kvothe, in this first of the trilogy, leaves me begging for more.  The characterization was so real, with strength and weaknesses, with good and bad - all rolled into a single role.  Is Kvothe hiding behind the mask of the simple innkeeper?  Or is that truly his life now? We've just begin to learn his story.  I eagerly await the next two books.  Amazing lands,and people,and magic, and music.....and a darn good story!
1401216676|1.0|Generally I am forgiving with well-intentioned works; however, this is neither well-intentioned nor well-realised. Although Brian Bolland's art is, as always, striking, the writing for The Killing Joke is lacking and in fact virtually nonexistent. Alan Moore was assured that the story would not be entered into continuity, and yet despite that it was. The irresponsibility and sheer idiocy of having a major continuity event take place in an extraneous graphic novel and not the actual comic titles is immediately lamentable, but the event itself is even moreso.<br /><br />Essentially this is just an excuse to torment beloved characters in excessive ways, yet it manages to pioneer absolutely no new territory. It is the same plodding plot that has always been associated with Batman and especially the Joker, and it is needlessly pretentious and unappealing. It goes far too far in some ways, and yet not far enough in others. All in all, it is completely needless, utterly superfluous, and should indeed not have ever been included in formal Bat-canon. Moore himself even said that if he had known they were going to take it into canon, he would never have done it. I only wish he had known beforehand.<br /><br />The Killing Joke is one of the worst Batman stories ever composed. It seems that whenever a new writer attempts to give a new and dangerous spin to the Joker, it ends up being the same spin that every other new writer attempts to give him. He's not an interesting villain any longer, and especially not as the same things are always done with him. In this case, you have him doddering along and ruining a character for the long term (that is not even plausible considering the setting) just so that he can share a completely overdone and unexceptional 'moment' with his mortal enemy. Who cares?<br /><br />This is yet another supremely overrated piece of drek that was always just style over substance and added nothing -- in fact detracted majorly -- from the Batman mythos. It'snot worth looking at, and it would be especially wonderful if everything that came from it were completely undone. It should never have entered into continuity, but now that it has, it's made the work even more lamentable.<br /><br />A piece of pretentious, self-important garbage. It's not even worth it for the Bolland visuals.
B0025X4P24|5.0|And Vanessa never did'nt disappoint her fans this time. Four years after her last album, \\"Everlasting Love\\", Vanessa had to figure everything out as she tries to reconnect her own fans. The result? She went back to the drawing board, and create her sound that call s it her own. This album is a perfect mixture of R&B/Soul, Quiet Storm, Smooth Jazz, Salsa & Standards.<br /><br />This album is dedicated to her late father, Milton Williams, a high-school music teacher who have taught Vanessa through her years in school; Milton's favorite singer happens to be Bill Withers, for whom his song \\"Hello Like Before\\" is specially written for Vanessa.<br /><br />Vanessa recorded 11 songs for her album between her summer breaks from her show, \\"Ugly Betty\\", and her first single, \\"Breathless\\", sounds quite like the love theme for Wilhelmina Slater, the character she plays on her show. She also did two more videos from her album, \\"Just Friends\\", & \\"Close to You\\". Other stand-out tracks include The Salsa flavored title track, \\"Loving You\\", and \\"Coming on Strong\\". The latter 2 songs makes you feel like you're in New Orleans.<br /><br />Personally, My favorite song off her album is \\"I Fell In\\", Which does have a strong making of a #1 Smash hit for Vanessa. I was moved by the song's lyrics, and this happens to be a life-changing song for the people who happens to walk down the same road like everybody else, and this song happens to carry a message of hope in a period of uncertainity of what's happening now.<br /><br />Vanessa's new album really does put the vibe into this vibracious,  extremely beautiful Sex Goddess. Put this in your i-Pod, and Enjoy The Music!
0783240287|5.0|If you are a Donny Osmond fan this is a must have.  I heard a few of these songs at a live Donny Osmond show. When his 70s CD came out.  It was so cool to hear the audience sing back to him.   So I had to get the DVD, I'm glad I did.
