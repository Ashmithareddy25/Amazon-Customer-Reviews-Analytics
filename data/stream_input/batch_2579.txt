B009XIXVU6|3.0|Like many others, I couldn't wait to read this book. I immediately started absorbing the tale of Abdullah and Pari. But, then it went to the next chapter and I was introduced to others. No more Abdullah and Pari until later on. I enjoyed many of the characters and their stories but it got to the point that once a new chapter started, those characters were left by the wayside. I would get attached to one and then bye bye. I love a book I can't put down and disregard other things that need being done, but on this one I'd put it down and find other things to do. I was simply disappointed with the lack of character development. One reason I gave it 3 stars is the writing and descriptions are beautiful.<br /><br />So many people absolutely love this book. I just did not.
B004UID2LC|4.0|It's great cause all those YouTube favorites can now be watch on my  own kindle even without WiFi......it forecloses every now and then. But for now it's tolerable :)
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|This isn't the greatest movie but it also isn't the worst by action movie standards. Schwarzenegger does his best at coming back into the movie biz again and I will have to say it's good to see him again in action. Not his best work but still a no nonsense fun action flick none the less. If your a fan of his other action movies and want some nostalgia then I say watch it because it is a fun popcorn flick. If your not a fan then I would say probably skip this one.
0312243022|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted to read the book. This is now one of my favorite boos of all time. The style of writing is very descriptive and in &#34;real time.&#34; Meaning, it's not exactly a slow read but you feel as though you are in that moment experiencing what the characters are and you get to share in their self reflection and self awareness. Really good book. I liked as much if not more than the movie. I think the movie did a pretty good job.
B002RKSZWG|4.0|It is always great to read the classics and this didn't disappoint. Plus the price can't be beat. I recommend it highly.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie. Quality audio and video!!! I can't tell you how much tension was in the room watching the movie!!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|One aspect of this film that demands more of a mention is something that has been sorely lacking in most of the Trek films through the years: Suspense. The original series had some truly suspenseful, nail biting moments that were unlike any suspense seen anywhere before. The Enterprise Incident, Obsession, Day Of The Dove and The Doomsday Machine all had moments of edge of your seat suspense and there were several others, but when it came to the films, something malfunctioned on the level of a major engineering blunder that would send Mr Scott into a tizzy: The suspense was largely gone. Seems impossible, given that with a film, there are MORE opportunities for intense suspense thanks to more time and better budgets which could lead to more elaborate plot points that could create tense situations, but alas, Star Trek got it wrong..... until now.<br /><br />With Star Trek Into Darkness we are treated to more suspense than the total sum of all suspenseful moments from the entire Original Series. If you're NOT on the edge of your seat watching this movie, trekker, trekkie or not, you must be a cliff diver or live on rollercoasters.<br /><br />Some of why the film is so suspenseful is the pacing itself. Abrams and his team barely allow you to recover from one suspenseful situation before the plot, which is excellent, hurls another one at you. That's not to say the film doesn't contain moments of heart and those humanistic elements Roddenberry built the franchise on, they are there, and in more abundance than has been recognized by other reviewers due to the pulse pounding action and incredible visual effects that will have you wanting to be a part of the Enterprise crew more than ever before.<br /><br />Abrams does a marvelous job at PROPERLY recreating in the new altered timeline everything that made the original series such a terrific show and he manages to make it fresh and appealing to everyone even more so than the first of his forays into the Star Trek universe.<br /><br />That there is a villain from a place you might not have seen coming (besides the villain that everyone has been muttering about, yes there are TWO villains in this film) that adds that topical touch of reflection of current headlines to the mix, another hallmark of much of the writing of the second and third seasons of the original series, is also a welcome plot point.<br /><br />To sum it up, Abrams and his crew have a huge uphill battle to endure now that they have so perfectly put together the most satisfying Trek film ever created. Here's hoping Abrams is up to the challenge and that he will continue going where no man has gone before.
B008VI0A2G|5.0|I like it except the last CD which contains outtakes and other filler, but the other 4 CD's contain everything recorded in the '50's like it says complete 1950's masters. I bought the repackaged set so be careful with putting the CD's back or taking them out because the plastic that holds them in tends to break from fatigue, so I wished it had better packaging. But great entertainment besides that. It's a keeper.
B005LAIHHC|2.0|For me this film was not funny at all, it's so artificial and mostly silly, that I must say, it's waste of time and money to watch it
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|I made a review for the deluxe edition of the album, which began with a lament that Best Buy offers the definitive version of the album.  The bonus disc is the more accesable, faster songs and the additional track, albeit just over 3 min, is worth every effing penny.  When I make my burn-for-the-road it will start with the 4 bonus tracks before progressing to the album proper.<br /><br />If you keep an open mind, you'll like it.  The songs get better as the album goes on.  Im only a few listens in but enjoying it immensely, with the hooks from God Is Dead? & Dear Father stuck in my head all day these last couple days.  Don't believe the haters.  They probably don't like Never Say Die! (my favorite) either.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I only can say I love it.<br />Everything is great, the actors, the set, the costumes, the story line, everything.<br />I'm addicted to it. Can't wait for the next release.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|First off, Damn You Best Buy!  You just HAD to offer an additional bonus track AND be cheaper than the independent store I picked my copy up from on release day.  It's a short song, but any and every Sabbath track is necessary for optimal enjoyment.  Especially b/c the bonus disc has ALL THE CATCHY FAST SONGS.  For people who have only heard that the album is slow, plodding & boring need to start with the second disc before digesting the album proper.  The album itself gets better as it goes along so that by Dear Father there is nowhere left to go... except back to the beginning.  Not the first track on the album, but the first track on the first album.  It puts the lyrics of their namesake song in a whole new light, even more sinister.  A fitting capstone to a storied career.<br /><br />You can't hold this album up to the classics, though as far as new releases from old bands go, it's pretty tits.  For all its perceived faults (at least the drummers initials are the same), its amazing and perhaps what makes me like it more is it seems to be a very personal album for the 3 involved members.<br /><br />Best companion/comparison to this album would be Pentagram's Last Rites.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great little book.  THANKS for the inspiration. LOOKING forward<br />To reading  more of your writing. IT seems that so much potential of mankind is lost to the race to the end-in the interest<br />Of greed & selfishness instead of the great er good.<br />Thanks again
B00AAI7B7W|4.0|I remember when The Exorcist first came out.  When I first saw it, I was quite disappointed and found it almost laughable at the time.  There was just so much hype surrounding it--people fainting in their seats, etc--that I thought it was incredibly over-rated.  The years went by and I decided to give it another look and I actually found myself enjoying it much more than my first viewing in the theater.  Now another 15 or so years have passed and I couldn't find anything better to watch so I decided to freshen my recollection of it once again and found it had aged fairly well.  It's still not a &#34;great&#34; work by any means, but it beats many movies being made today.  Yes, it is as silly and as unbelievable as ever, but hey, that's entertainment.  And when it's viewed that way, it is still quite an enjoyable piece of entertainment.  The acting is decent and there's actually some good character development and something like a plot.  So, all-in-all, The Exorcist has earned and deserved it's classic status quite well.
1421550644|5.0|If you are like me, and just keep going back and looking at this set with shiny, greedy eyes but aren't sure if you want to take that plunge and just get it over with, let me give you some advice.<br />GET IT NOW.<br />I almost missed my oppurtunity to get it (for less than a hundred+ smackaroos) And as soon as I thought I had, I realized how much I needed to have it. NEEDED.<br />It's worth every penny, cheaper than getting the individual books, binding is great, poster is great, box is fantastic protection against the humidity without adding more space on your shelf, and it just LOOKS fantastic on your shelf.<br />Get it. Get it now. You'll be glad you did.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I gave book 3 one extra star only because it added a little mystery to the mix. Hell, it even had a car chase in it.<br /><br />I have read all three books and found them very lame. Page after page of “I love you Christian” followed by “I love you Ana” and on, and on, and on. Their one-line emails (some of them one-word emails) go on and on as well. There must be 100 pages of emails.<br />There is very little erotic about these books. Most modern 16 year old girls can handle everything in these books.<br /><br />Lady’s, and guys, if you want to read well-written hot erotica without the crude language, check out the D’ Amour series written by Anne Marie Villefranche. They were written in chronological order starting with Plaisir D’ Amoure: an erotic memoir of Paris in the 20’s (Aug 1984). I believe there are six books in all, Joie D’ Amour, Folies D’ Amour, Mystere D’ Amour, Secrets D’ Amour and finally Souvenir D’ Amour. Save your money and look for these books instead. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I am trying to get Amazon to offer the D’ Amour series on Kindle. If you read any and agree with me, please let Amazon know.

0425263924|1.0|I first read this book because it was compared to 50 Shades. So disappointed with the series but especially the last book. I do not understand the reviewers who say that it is better than 50 Shades. It does not have the character development nor the story line that has made 50 the ground breaker that it is. I can not believe the lack of quality of writing and storyline in the last installment and then to read that the author has stressed out the series for 2 more books! I could not finish the 3rd book and will definitely not read the next 2 books.
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|This is one of the best novels that I have ever read (and I began reading novels more than fifty years ago). I don't understand why this book has not become a classic and have decided to put some effort into making it one. It is extremely well written, the theme is universal, the characters are very well developed. I can't think of anyone to whom I would not recommend this book.
B00846REIS|4.0|I actually read Reflected in you before reading this book. If I had read this book first, I'd be as interested to read the second as reading the second made me interested in reading the first. Good story. A little too much sex for my tastes, but the good story line made it readable.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Usually the middle book of a trilogy is a bit lame but I found that this book moved the plot/story (yes, there is one) along and still provided a lot of interest of its own. Again, things moved way faster than they would have in real life. I mean, who meets, goes to bed with, and marries someone within a couple of months? Oh, yeah, I did that. But we were broke. I guess that makes a difference.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The global tragedy of Afganistan ( via these books ) became more human and real for me.The book is unique and fascinating...it,s like a blast of fresh air during a summmer heat. Alexandra Sasha Reynolds. California
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If I never see the word &#34;smirk&#34; again, life will be fine. Yeah, the writing, she is not so good and yet it works. Because of the narrative structure, I guess you can get away with repetitive and uninspired phrases. Maybe it would have messed up the message if it had been more elegantly written. What message, you say? Yeah, definitely some great sex but there is real angst and real growth in these pages. The action is a bit contrived and the development is way to quick for my taste but, still, a message can be found. Oh, who am I kidding, this first book is about the sex.
0307352153|5.0|as somewhat introverted myself,  this book validated me in a way nothing else has.  I am ok, there is nothing wrong with me, I simple need more alone time than extroverts and that is just ok.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|But that doesn't hurt. There is a lot to explore in these books. I find I know all these people in one form or another and wish they could have found solutions for their own issues as easily (subjective analysis here) as these people did. Life is never so simple and certainly such encompassing solutions are not won in so short a time as represented in these books but it is a fun ride anyway. I think I even learned something about myself in these pages.

B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I imagine \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a hell of a book. The movie does make me want to read it. But does the book make for a good movie? That depends; you'll enjoy this one if you enjoy watching actors with a $1.99 disguise kit raid their parents closet in a mad dash to play dress-up. Despite the epic story arc and mind-bending themes, I found myself distracted by what amounts to a complete failure of the movie's wardrobe and make-up department to deliver. That's a shame, especially when there is so much good acting here, none of which is delivered by Tom Hanks this time. And the sound editing; simply dreadful. Please take the advice of another reviewer and turn the captions on because you won't understand a lot of what is being said, especially in the post-apocalyptic future where cave people living in Hawaii somehow sound like they're from Alabama. There's also the matter of the movie's first half, which meanders so far and wide that you're almost tempted to turn the movie off. I admit I am glad I stuck with it despite the afore mentioned misgivings. The second half of the movie wakes from its slumber, quickens its pace, and begins to weave all the threads together with results that are often heartbreaking yet nonetheless bespeak of hope. \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a three star movie that could possibly earn another half upon a second viewing, but I simply don't have that much time on my hands. If I did have that much time to kill, I'd sooner read the book.

B004UHSB5A|4.0|Out of all the domino games I played on my kindle, this app is the best so far.  There is a glitch. Sometimes you can put a domino right on top of another domino ,and the scoring will read something else. It doesn't happen all the time.  Once that happens the dominoes are not counted properly and it can screw up a game.  You have to be careful of the placement of the domino. Other than that, is a good app. Better than other domino games I've bought and played.
B0041T7FS6|3.0|Glad I've still got my 12\\" singles.<br />Maybe it's just me....but the \\"CD remastering\\" sounds pretty lousy. Compressed almost to the point of being distorted. The music sounds aggressive, almost hostile. Not liberating. Glad I got it just for the Sister Sledge stuff, but I'll play \\"My Forbidden Lover\\" off the vinyl, the other stuff off the earlier CD releases.
B000QXDED6|5.0|This heavy duty action film is based upon a true story.  Sometime around 465 BC, the Persians, under the rule of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) mounts an invasion force into the Greek homeland.  He leads an army reputed to have more than a million soldiers to the Hot Gates at Thermopylae.  King Leonidas (Gerald Butler) is onto their game and leads a party of 300 Spartans and 1000 Arcadian allies to intercept them.  But all is not well at home either.  As a plot is hatched to put Leonidas in disfavor with the senators and abuse his wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey).  Thereby leaving Leonidas without any badly needed reinforcements.<br /><br />Meanwhile Leonidas has his hands full at the Hot Gates.  Xerxes throws everything he has at them, including The Immortals, his most powerful warriors.  But the gates are so narrow, they cannot push past.  A deformed traitor proves to be his undoing though, and shows Xerxes a way around the pass and behind Leonidas.  It is interesting here that the very kind of deformed imperfect people the Spartans try to rid themselves of, causes their downfall.<br /><br />The Spartans revere physical fitness above all and are said in battle to come home with their shields or upon them.  The actors here in 300 are all very buff, especially having great abs.  After watching the movie, I tried to achieve the same effect and failed miserably.<br /><br />Director Larry Fong did an admirable job filming this great semi historical epic story.  It's films like this that can bring history to a life never achieved or imagined from reading a dull dry history book.  In fact, to some of the more intense viewers, it's like being there as a participant yourself. Nearly 2500 years have passed but what was done there that day is still remembered.

It has everything I am looking for. A very visible sweeping second hand. military time, date, lumes, and relatively clean look. But I work (manual labor) Fridays to Sunday and I cant wear a wrist watch on the weekends.<br /><br />I realized that I was probably going to set the time on this watch every Sunday and I just didn't feel like dealing with that. I wish I have the extra money to be able to keep the watch but like I said.... just a student.

I was stunned that Hayek didn't receive the Oscar that year, she deserved it hands down. Fully developed story of the life of Frieda, one of the great artists of the 20th century. Simply a must see film. Very poignant is the scene where Frida's former lover singer, Chavala Vargus, sings to Selma as Frida. A magical erie scene.

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I thought it was new. I'd already seen it but it was great anyway. six more words required? it's all been said.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series is so addicting.  I can't keep from watching it.  Brilliant cast and reflects the best of British broadcasting.
B004IYWN7C|5.0|a good movie for the whole family!! an the adults can enjoy, the more adult side to the humor. cheap an on instant video.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Okay you just have to watch all the doctor shows every made, from the last 50 years.  It might take a long time but it is better than other shows out there.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Ridiculous plot, corny dialogue, over-the-top chase sequences….  and that was only the first 20 minutes!  Sadly, I think the Die Hard franchise has finally run its course.  Goodbye, John McClane…
0786955554|4.0|This resource was a  great help in running D&D 4.0 games.  I recommend it for GMs to use in they game.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I like Theodore Boone. The plots are intriguing and thoughtful in all the books, but Theo is still a 13 year old kid. He is knowledgeable and mature, but he still thinks and acts like a 13 year old. Kids like that are fun to be around. After reading all of the Theodore Boone books I may try some of Grisham's for adult books. My granddaughter reads and likes them too.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out because I so enjoyed his first two.  Although still focused mainly on Afghanistan, this story was very different but equally compelling.  The reader had to pay attention because characters came and went, sometimes over the span of many years.  The plot had many twists and jumps as well; not everything was handed to the reader in a neat little package.  Several times I went backward in the book to see if I had missed a clue.  Personally, I appreciated being treated as someone who could get from Point A in the story to Point C without an obvious map.  A smart book.  Hosseini has the ability to voice all the inner thoughts and secret fears of his characters with pinpoint accuracy.  I can't think of another book with as much insight.  Even though it is a cliche, I REALLY hated to see it end.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I ordered this after seeing Leonard Cohen live for the first time...I was blown away by his show and ordered this because I wanted more!!  This double CD did not disappoint.  It has been in my player since it arrived and I listen to at least part of it almost every day.  Leonard Cohen is superb and this brings me back to the incredible performance I was lucky to see a few months ago.  The sound on this album is great and the song selection is very satisfying.  I am thrilled that Take This Waltz appears on the album, as it is one of my favorite songs and it sounds great.  If you are an LC fan, definitely add this to your collection!
B000XQR7VQ|2.0|I agree with a lot of reviews here which say that the writing/presentation fails to impress. As a veteran of Paulo Coelho,James Van Praagh, Neale Donald walsh, and Chicken Soup for the Soul books, I was not moved at all. I thought the book would follow the journey of Jullian through India, but no it's just Jullian talking n talking n talking. It's like reading a very long lecture. It would have been much better if instead of a long conversation with Jullian it would have been many short conversations maybe once a week and in between we could have seen John applying the principles to his own life. We don't see the change happening in John. We are not given a clear picture of John's life n what is wrong with it. We don't see how he benefits from the \\"wisdom\\" for Jullian. The ideas are great, but they should have been clothed better. There are many people out there who say the same things in much better presentation. If the state of Robin Sharma's best work is like this, then I am not doing to bother with his other books.
B000F8DB4O|5.0|My copy was destroyed and I just had to get another copy. I can listen to this CD all day.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Even if you have accomplished these goals in life ,it's never a bad idea to read a book that will help you stay on track.
B00AFEX83C|4.0|It's a PIxar flick; the 2.5 year old likes it and that was the goal. Looking forward to the sequel.
B0012NO316|4.0|The acting was at its best. I don't usually watch these older movies. Although it was dark it was impressive to watch great performers at their best.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This was a typical MI movie.  Almost to predictable but still enjoy the action packed scenes. Def worth a watch especially free on Amazon Prime!
B00D6OV57O|5.0|Don't go into the film or the purchase of this soundtrack expecting John Williams. This score does not have \\"Can you read my mind\\". It is driving, and at points, very subtle. After seeing it fit within the film, it all makes perfect sense. I really enjoy it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids 10 and 12 love it!  My house has never been cleaner!  Chores first before they play this game!
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD FATHER AND FLICK WITH LOTS OF FAMILIAR ACTION, THIS IS A MOVIE FOR THE YOUNG AND NOT SO YOUNG.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|This game was pretty fun until i clicked on the level drag n dash In the middle of the level it just stoped working. Plus the controls always freeze up and u can't move. I think it's a waste of 99&cent;.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Awesome game couldn't stop playing... Great for both kids and adults... Just like the movie almost the  same action... love the graphics. Can't wait to level up to get more cool stuff
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|The Impossible starring Oscar nominee, Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor will leave you in tears. This film is breathtaking and gut-wrenching to watch, make sure to have some tissues nearby. This incredible, heartfelt film just broke my heart. There is nothing like when strangers come together and the human spirit is tested. Naomi Watts is spellbinding and fearless as Maria, and I still can't believe she didn't win lead actress at the Oscars earlier this year. McGregor plays Watt's husband in the film and he turns out a solid performance as well. The Impossible is based on a true story, I also recommend watching the audio commentary which features the real Maria. I love, love, love this movie...it's powerful and so good for the soul. I highly recommend it!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|SAW IT IN HOUSTON ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, PLAN ON SEEING IT AGAIN THIS SUMMER,I LOVE THE TWIST ON THE WIZARD OF OZ!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This isn't necessarily a game I would play over and over but my children (age 4 and 6) seem to love it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Challenging and fun. A good game to occupy the time and keep the mind working. Can frustrating to find some things.
B005GIS23I|2.0|It was pretty funny until Paul arrived unfortunately, he just isn't that funny. All the characters were stereotyped and as flat as the alien CGI , no depth at all.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Thanks Sylvia Day as usual you did not disappoint!! I can't wait for next chapter in Gideon and Eva's life together!! I so recommend this series to all readers! It shows the power of a deep love over someones dark side and secrets!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 it!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great to be able to get all the books I love, on a device I can cary in my pocket. No longer the hassle of luging a book around when traveling to a doctors office or some other waiting room. I now have several of the books on my phone, to read anywhere I please.
0679809015|5.0|It is a simple book, but my son loved it when he first got it 2 years ago and now my daughter has one. She is just learning how to talk and loves this book. She likes trying to imitate the sounds and names that each animal makes. She also really likes that it is small enough for her to carry (~3.5&#34; x 3.5&#34;) AND that it has flaps to open for her to discover each animal. Some people have complained that it is too simple a book, but for children that are just learning how to talk and differentiate animals it is perfect. I will be getting one for our next child when she starts to talk.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|While the world of the Walking Dead is growing bigger, character and story remain at the center. So even when it seems to be pulling away from the story of Rick Grimes, it manages to stay true to itself. The introduction of the Governor as a duplicitous borderline psychotic leader of a refugee camp is a move that promises to reap benefits in Season 4.<br /><br />MILD SPOLIERS<br />The return of Merle was capped off with an outstanding reunion with his brother Daryl. Meanwhile the shifting alliances of supporting characters kept viewers guessing from week to week. For fans of the father and son who who first saved Rick in Season 1 Episode 1, there's a bitter sweet reunion that made me wish he was back for a recurring role.<br /><br />Bring on Season 4!
B0038AUYKU|4.0|Kurt Wallander is a tireless detective, addicted to coffee and solving a case. He is &#34;old school&#34;, rumpled, loves his drink and hopeless in his pursuit of a female relationship.
B009NY43NY|1.0|After 12 books, I was disappointed in this book.  New characters, a sloppy mish-mosh of the old characters and unresolved relationships left me wishing I had stopped reading these books years ago.
B001QD3JYE|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie! I only watched it because I love Johnny Depp But it was a great movie regardless. Johnny Depp makes the character perfect though. I do realize that not everything in the movie is 100% accurate but it is very entertaining and gives you a good look into how drugs got big in America.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|The actor is so gorgeous and his acting isn't bad either.  I really really like Gillian Hough's character and how she make you empathizes really well with her as you receive more of the storyline.  The last few seconds of the movie are a little confusing but over all it was a wonderful movie.  Nicholas Sparks does it again and I like how you don't know how he is going to end his movies anymore like the previous ones.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so... Amazing. Although I'm sure  one cannot imagine the heartache or struggle that comes with an awful disease such as cancer, this book does an impeccable job at capturing the raw emotion.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Let's be honest: almost everyone has a twitter account whether they admit to it or not. The Twitter app is great for reading through your feed, composing your own tweets, or creeping on celebrities. I recommend it without a doubt!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This app is really fun, especially if you enjoy solving mysteries. This app will you jumping at every creak. Playing it a night is even more exhilarating, with surprises at every turn. The downside is that if you buy the free version, it ends fairly soon, with a pop-up encouraging you to p purchase the full version. :)
B000CNEO1G|5.0|My husband and I first heard Alison Balsom on our public radio station -- and loved what we heard -- so we have been buying her CD's and we manage to secure tickets to her performance at Town Hall in NYC.  What a treat!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THREE APPS I AM USING TO READ PDF FILES.  IT IS GOOD AN IT WORKS WELL AS WELL AS PROVIDIN ANOTHER OPTION TO READ ARTICLES WHEN I AM ON THE RAOD.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Makes a nice night-light. Cool alarm sounds. Easy to use.<br /><br />I would appreciate a wider range of clock faces and white noise.<br /><br />Overall a solid app for kindle.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|The attempt to combine the tale of a disturbed army veteran and a cult leader totally failed. Both were fatally compromised.
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|Who can really top his iconic theme, that we have associated with Superman for the last 36 years?<br /><br />While the theme is now gone for this movie, this collection has its own appeal. There is a recurring theme that underlies various tracks. Signifying hope (&#34;Its not an 'S'.....On my world it means Hope&#34;) and Kal's/Clark's own identity crisis, the music does evoke his inner turmoil to find the man he has to decide to become.<br /><br />Is it Superman? No.<br /><br />I love Hans Zimmer, having grown up with his music from the Disney films. I am a fan outright.<br /><br />Call me biased, but after hearing the iconic John William's soundtrack (which has since been carried on to 4 movies, 5 when you count the try at a reboot in 2006, an animated series, a 10 year run live action tv series, countless video games --including the various Lego based ones, and other Superman media) for the last 35 years, its kind of hard to accept the next gen theme.<br /><br />Give me a couple of more movies and it will most likely grow on me.<br /><br />4 stars out of 5 as its a good listen (the whole cd can be listened to in about an hour). My kids definitely liked it after hearing the songs in the trailers for the last half year.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This book was amazing, was it was thrilling and surprised me at every turn if the page, I just wish there were more books after this, it's just so great.. before you read this you must read the first two, they are great!!!!!!
B003G4W49C|3.0|Didn't really like this book...might be that I've moved away from sci-fi books. But it didn't make want to continue in the series.
B00BB22GSU|5.0|Great album, really enjoyed it. If you want to read more, look up a Pitchfork review or listen to the NPR All Songs audio interview with the two main guys.
B008KP6ENE|3.0|At first it was confusing on how to use the controls but after a awhile it made more sense. Its a really fun game when you get the basics
B00821OX98|5.0|Character development is great. The story premise is a good mix of science fiction and history, when a smaller, less powerful force is able to push back a larger, stronger one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It has twists and turns and you don't know what's going to happen next.  Alittle romance and just an easy read.  It grabs you from the beginning.  I loved it and kin of excited to read Losing Hope. First time read from this author and it didn't disappoint.
B0093QE37S|5.0|This film is an older one but the story is still very entertaining and the acting excellent.  The later version of the film with Grace Kelly, Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra was not as entertaining.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Although I wasn't able to sit and watch the entire movie all at once I truly loved it! I loved where they took the movie and its plot.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|I have a kindle fire. I tried to download videos and this stupid app crashes every time. I report for what. users beware of viruses and crashes overall I like the app but the frequent crashes to have to download the app again I will lose all my already downloaded videos. this app has bugs
B000005H3R|5.0|This was a replacement for a CD that was loved to pieces. Highly reccomend . Special kudo's for \\"Tenderly\\" duet with Joe Williams . . . Supurb!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Master storyteller Khaled Hosseini once again manages to tell a wonderful tale of broken people, whose lives intertwine in the most unexpected ways. I loved seeing the restraint in his writing. He has matured as a writer, and probably I have matured as a reader as well; preferring subtlety over exaggerated displays of emotions. I cried for the characters in his previous books, Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. But I journeyed and empathized and experienced catharsis with the characters of And The Mountains Echoed.
B000FCKBCU|2.0|Not exactly the best kinsella book. I found the plot too predictable and far-fetched. My best kinsella book is Remember Me?
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|wife liked it.  i thought it was a bit slow.<br />neither liked the ending.<br />not a movie i would watch again.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|Pretty good game if you like games like &quot;Mario bros&quot; and the &ldquo; Sims&quot; but I wouldn't recommend it for people who don't like those games
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game it inspires me to help animals and makes me love animals even more it is very fun I just got a baby zebra :)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|my kids are enjoying this game :) however i liked the previous version. there's just a problem wih navigation once in a while.
B0093QDGEO|5.0|Really funny, clever, and well-done. You wouldn't think this would be good, but it's HILARIOUS. It's smart in a savvy, but self-depreciating way that's super rare and fun to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is fun and a great pass time. It is very accurate and you can buy clothes and powerups for the characters which is pretty cool. The best part is that it was free, which makes the game even better.
030746363X|5.0|This book is exactly what my husband and I were wanting.  Has tons of great info.  Would recommend to anyone to buy it and read.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app is great it gives you a huge selection of  makeup and clothing. U have to pay a dollar to get everything but it's worth it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|What a quirky, delightful novel!  It is full of picturesque characters.  I was eager to see whom he might meet next.  Go Harold!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My opinion is that they should make a Illinois theme. Maybe on Mattoon? My other one is that they should really let us customize ate own characters.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoy the story and the author really knows how to keep your attention to the hero's heart .  I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think that this is the best book to read. I highly recommend Catching Fire! I wish there were more than three books
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Even though this is a tv series, I consider it's a movie because it's so much better than many movies of the same genre.<br /><br />It excels in many angles such as plots, characters' depth, suspense, action, acting and directing.<br /><br />The plot is thick. It has many twists that I could not foresee. They also make this show suspenseful and exciting.<br /><br />There are so many characters with depth that it's amazing. For example, besides Spartacus, the story of Crixus and his lover is deeply touching. She even risked her life for him.<br /><br />The action scenes are extremely bloody, brutal and decisive. Many limbs and heads were chopped off. Most of the times, the blood was digitized. So, it did not look as real as ketchup but the scenes were still terrifying.<br /><br />The directing is perfect to me. Every scene was beautifully filmed and crafted. All the action scenes were intense, horrifying and bloody. There were also lots of touching love scenes.<br /><br />Besides Spartacus, the acting of many other characters is also superb such as Crixus, Quintus, Lucretia, Ashur, Doctore, etc. For example, Crixus, convincingly portrayed himself as a passionate man deeply in love. When he was angry, I could see exploding hate in his eyes.<br /><br />As for Quintus, I was so caught up in his acting that in the end, I really hated his character.<br /><br />It contains a lot of red hot sex scenes. It also depicts homosexual relationship. Definitely, it's not suitable for children.<br /><br />I've watched this show two times. I was deeply and satisfactorily entertained every time.<br />If you love period shows/movies, you don't want to miss this one.<br /><br />In short, it's one of the BEST that my MONEY CAN GET. It's perfect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one cool game!it's easy to learn and you just want to  keep dodging trains!I recommend this to anyone who's into addicting games!
B00881VLCE|4.0|The pictures are beautiful.  You can choose how many pieces you want the puzzle to be.  I find it amusing.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Overall, I just like being able to go on my phone and check out the news feed, make a few comments here and there, and see what's going on. I also like that I can access my messages, contact info for contacts, events, etc.  I've enjoyed checking in places, posting pictures, and updating my status on the fly. Like I said, it's Facebook and the app stays pretty true to all the features that I can get on my computer.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is heavily criticized by some as being to confusing, childish, and horribly written. All of these may be to a point true but not to the point where want it banished from the Star Wars Saga. While I must admit that it might possibly be the lowest point in the saga, it is still a great movie. It is a great beginning to such a legendary saga that has been expanding through books, movies, short stories and the internet for almost 40 years.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />The Phantom Menace begins with two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi on a mission to settle a conflict with the Trade Federation. The Federation has blockaded Naboo because their Trade Routes have been taxed and they are trying to get the Queen, Amidala, to sign a treaty that will stop the taxing. The Jedi are attempting to negotiate with the Federation and stop the situation that has gotten far out of hand. When the negotiations go wrong the Jedi find themselves in the midst of an invasion that the Trade Federation is planning on the peaceful planet of Naboo. The Jedi are intent to warn the Naboo but are a moment to late. The invasion begins. The Jedi attempt to flee the planet with the Queen for they fear she will be killed. Amidst their flee the ship they are in is damaged and they are forced to land on the desert planet of Tatooine where the fate of the galaxy will be changed forever. On the planet Tatooine they find a boy (who's name we all know) Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon believes this boy to be the chosen one who will bring balance to the force and is intent to bring him to the Jedi Council on Coruscant and have him tested to become a Jedi. To get the parts they need Anakin will have to race in a podrace and if he wins they will obtain the money for the parts they need. Meanwhile, a Sith spy, named Darth Maul, has been sent out to find the Queen that has escaped Naboo with the Jedi. Maul's hunt for the Queen and the finding of Anakin Skywalker will begina battle that will be the first steps toward the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire and the Rebellion and ultimately begin the stride toward the original Star Wars film that we all know.<br /><br />SPOILERS END<br /><br />The Phantom Menace, to some fanboys that expected far to much from George Lucas, are displeased with the movie. But to me who saw the prequel trilogy first, The Phantom Menace shatters expectations. It serves as a great beginning to such an in depth saga. It is great movie overall, with a great story and astounding visual effects that will surely please all (except the fanboys who expected to much) who watch it.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|I wasn't a huge fan of Pages Manager at first because you couldn't &#34;share&#34; things on your page from the regular Facebook app, but now you can! So, I'm pretty pleased with that, and it seems like they've been making more improvements on managing the pages from the app. Overall it is convenient to be able to manage the pages all in one place.
B0063IH60K|4.0|classic game - easy to play with the hints and ability to tap a card and it goes where its supposed to
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I usually figure out the ending before I see it, but this was a great surprise ending.  Love the movie!!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The first half of the book was good; the second half was not. Too many characters were introduced who were irrelevant; a disjointed and confusing second half. I had to force myself to finish the book, which was frustrating since the first half was very interesting.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|What happens when you take quite a few excellent actors and put them in the same movie?  Almost always it's the same:  blah.  And blah some more.<br /><br />Not that this is necessarily an ensemble film, but it is certainly close.  Clint Eastwood, one of the best directors ever and a very good actor as well.  Amy Adams, one of my favorite actresses who rarely makes a misfire.  Justin Timberlake, who I think is actually better as an actor than as a singer (check out \\"The Social Network\\" if you disagree.)  And John Goodman, who -- minus \\"Roseanne\\" -- is always good for a really good laugh.<br /><br />I could argue that the dialog is full of sports clichés, and I would have a strong argument there.  However, in reality, people often speak in clichés in real life -- particularly sports; have you ever listened to a sports broadcast? -- so I don't always have a problem with it in film.  But worse, \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" feels overly manipulative to me.  You've got the daughter-who's-still-upset-with-daddy thing going on.  You've got the old-timer-who's-career-is-coming-to-a-close thing going on as well.  And you've got the unnecessary-love-triangle thing that might be the worst.  The entire plot just felt terribly contrived to me.<br /><br />It looks like Mr. Eastwood didn't direct this film, and perhaps if he had, it would have surely been better.  I think that if he had directed, he would have required a rewrite on the script, and he would have made it less manipulative.  After all, Mr. Eastwood is an expert at taking a story, telling it straight, and not purposefully manipulating his audience.<br /><br />What's the \\"Trouble with the Curve\\"?  I think there was a story here somewhere trying to get out that, well, unfortunately remained on the bench.  And to risk using another sports cliché while simultaneously ending a sentence with a preposition:  They should have just sent Robert Lorenz down and called Mr. Eastwood up.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|Doesn't have technical details on implementation, more focused in what HTML5/Javascript have to offer nowadays. But, being a quick reading, it's worth the price.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I truely do not like zombie movies or books, that type of undead story never appealed to me and really didn't seem romantic.  When I watched the preview for warm bodies I laughed and thought how it seemed so very different.  This movie did not disappoint me and I would tell friends and family they should watch.  I fell in love with R which I couldn't believe cause well, he is dead and eats people.  I loved the humor in this movie and was grinning quite a bit.  I think if you hate zombie stories this one will surprise you and you will love.  Give it a chance, I am glad I did.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|Warm (no pun intended), touching movie.  Very humorous as well.  I think the &#34;bonies&#34; and some of the zombies might be a bit much for younger kids.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Beautiful scenery and costumes.  Mostly great actors and characters.  The plot is a little like a soap opera, but really draws one in.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love going on here for some of my tattoo ideas. Great shopping and gift ideas as well. I'm on pinterest at least 3-4 times a day lol. I addicted to it :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is good to waste time around on while waiting for something to do. I didn't know what this was till I searched it up on youtube
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever! Great dynamics between Jennifer and Brad, plus Robert DeNiro! Every actor is wonderful, plus a great story!
B009NY43NY|4.0|From the first pages, it was clear how the saga would end.  And it made perfect sense.  I'm sorry to see it end, though.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|It's clear to see the heart and struggle of this author.  A witness to the horror in Dresden, he shares his story with candor and perspective only a genuine witness can relay.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love it<br /><br />I would recommend it to other buyers<br /><br />The case gives me a little bit more piece of mind knowing it will be covered if not in use.<br />Fits tight like a glove
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I am addicted to this game. Graphics are great and it keeps you entertained for hours.  Easy to understand and play but difficult enough to be a challenge. Worth the upgrade.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements is an amazing, insightful book.  I've bought it multiple times, read it then gave it away to a friend.  Everyone I give it to loves it and finds something useful in it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is similar to the Secret =. The difference between the two books is that this book is much easier to read and process. Love this book
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is an excellent product; However, the primary knife I bout it for is too thick to be sharpened effectively . It is great for pocket knives and medium thickness knives. The serrated blade sharpener is great and really works.
B0076NAVNA|5.0|Rock n roll done right.This is a fantastic recording,I liked it from the start,not a bad song on it.The more I listen to it the better I like it.Hoping there will be a follow up.Kudos to the musicians involved.Buy it,you won't be disappointed.
B006TKP2B2|3.0|A fast read and not all that compelling. The first third of the book kept wondering when the story was going to go somewhere. Thought the ending pooped out on us. Was Emiko the main character in the story or wasn't she. Felt like Bacigalupi couldn't decide whether he wanted her to be a heroine or a victim. The premise was interesting and certainly makes one sit up and take notice about all the GMO who-ha going on in the press right now. Just read this book.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I would normally be happy with anything staring Bruce Willis but this was not up to par.  It was all right but not up to what I had expected.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to lovers of film, lovers of humankind, and lovers of what's good about life. And, after only about three minutes, the subtitles were not even noticeable. It was that good. Enjoy!
B00006LFGD|4.0|It is Barbara Streisand !!!I have all her records and she is just wonderful on Duets . She does it all on this CD
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Nice to have this service for the different devices I have to access the info when needed.  Recommended to all.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|If you are a Scifi fan this series calls your name. I myself enjoyed all of the star gate series and am definitely a fan of this one. Watch it, you will not be disappointed!
B002CSC5EC|4.0|I was not able to go to this so getting a good copy with the extras was a big plus.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love to read that is why my mom got me this kindle. This book was actually a pretty good book. I pick 5 stars because I just loved the problems and the solutions to it. I think this book is good for fifth graders maby sixth and seventh. I loved this book and I hope all of u read this book too.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Very fun game.  So much fun your fingers will get sore!! (as mine did, from playing too much).<br /><br />It was great for one complete play through (a few hours), but wasn't great enough to go back and try to unlock all the planes I had missed.<br /><br />There are a tonne of planes to unlock.<br /><br />I got it for free, so no complaints.  I uninstalled after my initial play through though.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|The Amazon videos do not stream well. I have to wait minutes to watch the movie. This happens every 15 minutes or so. And this is on my computer hard wired to the internet. I gave up trying to watch any videos from the Amazon site thru Wi Fi.
B0036T31YY|5.0|Watched it twice - great movie. Be prepared for complete and total mental engagement though. You can't half pay attention, because you won't have a clue what happened.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Humans, yeah, can you believe it.  Relatable.  Real.  People just trying to find their way.  No bad bad guys.  No nauseatingly unreal good guys.  Maybe you know someone like this?!  .... and they have a story to tell ....
B005K17RU0|1.0|they wrecked a clean layout. the new version complicates using the app. I wish they would go back to the old version.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely love this show.  What an interesting era, so rich in history. Great acting & such colorful, intense characters. Looking forward to Season 4 and so on ...
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Over the years, the Superman franchise has had its share of hits and misses - both on the big screen and the little screen.  Depending on who was wearing the cape, Superman has soared to the amazement of viewers, and also crashed and burned, falling out of favor with fans and ending with cancellation.  George Reeves was nearly every child's idol in the 1950s.  In the late 1970s and 80s, Christopher Reeve did such a tremendous job with the iconic red and blue character that it's quite possible no one will ever wear the cape quite as well again.  Through the 1990s and 2000s, Dean Cain and Tom Welling kept Superman alive on TV, while the Superman film franchise lay in ruins, desperate for someone to return the character to prominence.  In 2006, Bryan Singer did an admirable job, casting Brandon Routh as the lead, yet the film never quite clicked with Superman fans.  Now, seven years later - director Zach Snyder and the man responsible for Batman's return to fame, Christopher Nolan, have completely re-imagined a modern Superman.  Will the summer of 2013 belong to the Man of Steel, or is this just another poorly executed effort that fails to find the essence of the greatest comic book character of all-time?<br /><br />Directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), Man of Steel stars Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El, an alien sent to earth from a dying world.  As a child, Clark Kent desperately tries to fit in, even though he has extraordinary super powers.  As an adult, he must either embrace the idea that he's humanity's protector, or risk watching the earth be destroyed by the arrival of General Zod (Michael Shannon) - a Kryptonian criminal hell-bent on repopulating his race on earth.  Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Antje Traue, and Russell Crowe also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />It's a travesty to watch a character so engrained in American culture treated in such a poor, careless manner.  Man of Steel is an absolute mess and you can place the blame squarely on the writer and director.  Christopher Nolan and David Goyer may have had a pulse on Batman in The Dark Knight trilogy, but as far as Superman goes - they should be ashamed of themselves and never be allowed to touch this character ever again.  Director Zack Snyder completely misses the mark, spending the majority of his time focused on uninteresting spaceships and the endless amount of buildings falling down.  Snyder completely sacrifices screen time that would have been much better spent establishing characters, including but not limited to Lois Lane, Martha Kent, Perry White, and the completely absent Jimmy Olson.  And, don't even both with that \\"we were saving him until the sequel\\" crap because Jimmy Olson is just as important to Superman lore as Lois Lane, Smallville, and Krypton.  Superman Returns was a flawed film, but at least that film took the time to incorporate the important aspects of the Superman universe.<br /><br />Who is this Superman in Man of Steel?  He's certainly nobody you'll recognize from the comic books, previous films, or basically any other variation of the character.  For instance, someone needs to explain the logic behind the most powerful superhero on the planet being forced to hitchhike.  It defies comprehension how in the snap of a finger this character can be on the other side of the world, yet when a bar rat half his size gets under his skin, his first reaction is to quit his job and hitchhike to the next town (and no, it doesn't make up for such a ridiculous idea even if the truck says LexCorp on it).  While we're on the subject, why is Superman working in a bar?  You have to be kidding with this stuff.  Not only has Superman worked in a bar, he's also tried his hand at being a sea fisherman, too.  Feel free to drop your jaw and say, \\"huh?\\"  These are just the small, tiny nuances that will make you want to scratch your head.  We haven't even got to the completely flawed decision that Superman makes atthe end of the film, which completely goes against every single standard set for the character since his creation.  Suddenly, the decision to make Superman a parent (Superman Returns) doesn't seem like the dumbest decision ever made.<br /><br />Superman is a character with near limitless power at his disposal, yet he fails to use half of his abilities in the film for more than mere instances.  Several attributes, like his x-ray vision, heat vision, and superhuman hearing are briefly displayed, while one of his most prominent powers, super breath, is nonexistent.  This superhero is supposed to be invulnerable, but somehow manages to spend the majority of this film getting beat up and knocked down, not just by his fellow Kryptonians, but also by bullies at school.  For a reboot film that is meant to establish Superman as a character to be feared, he certainly doesn't stand out above any of the other countless Kryptonians that manage to find their way to earth.  Superman is a character of standards, standing prominently in the defense of humanity, but his human side appears to dominate his thoughts, showing little interest in preserving the future of his native people.  Sadly, it's hard to call him anything other than slightly above average in Man of Steel.<br /><br />Even though the plot is complete trash and does absolutely nothing for the advancement of the DC Cinematic Universe, the film is not devoid of a few shining stars.  Did you ever imagine Russell Crowe or Kevin Costner wouldn't bring their A-game for this film?  As the fathers of Kal-El/Clark Kent, these two masterful actors display a complete understanding of their characters, quickly establishing that they are out to nudge their son in the right direction, ultimately leaving Clark to decide the man he wants to be.  Michael Shannon is no Terence Stamp, but he does mold the role of the vengeful, angry General Zod into his own, creating a grander villain as opposed to the character Stamp displayed in Superman and Superman II.  And, while we're on the subject of Zod - sadly, there's no classic \\"kneel before Zod\\" quote to look forward to in this disappointing film.<br /><br />As far as the rest of the cast goes, they are basically average at best.  Henry Cavill brings the attractive features to the role of Superman, but he suffers from the same fate as his predecessor (Brandon Routh) - a proper dialogue for the character.  He's a far cry Christopher Reeve, not to mention Tom Welling.  Superman's romance interest, Lois Lane, ineloquently follows the gigantic breadcrumbs right to the front door of the Kent farm, eliminating any possibility of future quirky exchanges between Lois and Clark at the Daily Planet with Superman (disguised) staring her right in the face.  Speaking of the Planet, Laurence Fishburne showed such great potential in the role of the Planet's editor, Perry White, but is left to flounder around for more than half of the film due to yet another nauseating and destructive alien invasion.  This all just goes to show you that no matter how many high profile names are in your film, they all look foolish without an interesting story and progressive dialogue.<br /><br />With an array of villains in Superman's rough gallery, it's unfortunate that the writers and filmmakers choose to go with another General Zod story.  Man of Steel feels much more like a Brainiac story than a Kryptonian origin story, leaving far too many questions unanswered.  The countless blunders of this film compared to previous comic book failures, like Ang Lee's Hulk and Green Lantern.  Speaking of the green guardian, there is no mention of him or any other major characters from the DC Universe - meaning there's absolutely no lead-in to a potential Justice League film or a Batman/Superman team-up.  Allegedly, there's a Wayne Enterprises logo on a satellite during the film, but if that's the best they can do for a reference, that's just sad and bothersome - which is basically the overlyingtheme of this film anyway.<br /><br />Overall, Man of Steel is one of the worst comic book films to date.  Not only did they do away with John Williams' famous theme music, the filmmakers completely failed to make Superman interesting and frankly, they obviously don't understand the character at all.  This all comes as a bit of a shock, but there it is in all of its CGI-abusive glory.  Granted, Superman's costume looks great and his origin remains intact, but that doesn't change the fact that this film is too long, bumbling from the get-go, and a complete misrepresentation of the Superman character.  In any event, a Man of Steel sequel has apparently been fast-tracked, so we're apparently stuck with Zack Snyder and his poor re-imagining of Superman.  Hopefully a sequel can right the ship before we're forced to go another seven years without a Superman flick.<br /><br />Overall Grade:  D-<br />FNDNreview.coman and Superman II.

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This is a touching book with unexpected twists. It feels like its geared toward teens, rather than adults. But it was enjoyable.

B00D2K40WY|1.0|My little girl wanted this game so bad and when I downloaded it and we went to play it we could not play it unless we bought the game but it was in the free games  section
B0058SN2C2|5.0|I bought these shoes back in early August 2012 and wore them nearly every day (even in the rainy Oregon winter!) until June 14th, 2013 when a hole was worn through the bottom. Just remember to order on the smaller side (I am normally an 8.5 and an 8 was perfect). I am ordering them again!
B008Y73940|4.0|The storyline had some interesting twists and surprises.  McConaughey is a good actor and kept my interest throughout the movie.
0765337541|5.0|Was just like the description. Showed up on time. So far the book is great and I'm only a couple chapters in.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Was expecting something &#34;out of the ordinary&#34; after hearing about how shocking and sexy the book was supposed to be.<br />really it's  just boring.
0451196716|2.0|This is my first SK book that I have read. The premise behind the book is intriguing and the character build up is also very good. I found myself cheating for some of the guys to make it through. When I finished reading it I thought I was somehow missing pages. A quick read, I have not read other SK novels but I do not recommend this one.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really don't care for Zombies but I found this an interesting read. Max Brooks does a good job of making a history book fun to read.
B008QTUA5W|1.0|I was hoping this series was going to grab me like 24 did but I only made it through the first twenty minutes of the first episode.  Wasn't looking for f-bombs and bare breasts.  I'm sure some people think that's fine, but it's just not for me.  Interesting, though, that 24 managed to keep us all on the edge of our seats with out the need for profanity and/or nudity.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun during down time or time in a waiting room! I haven't gone to far yet but it's great having the different things to upgrade and keep going
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|fun. challenging! adventurous. exciting. bumpy! 200, 400, 600! up, up and away. ludicrous. craziness. elevation change. formula one! watch out!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game keeps you playing and wanting to move to the next level.  It is very hard to get the sunken items!
B009CF3MEK|1.0|I couldn't watch this film after about 30 minutes of trying to like the female lead. She is not very attractive and her personality was so annoying!  A man as handsome, successful and intelligent as Robert Redford's character Gatsby would never be able to stand this airhead lady after one encounter.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|A great movie and fun too. Paris in the rain beauty and finding solace and inspiration from the past to extricate oneself from present troubles and a drone of a time to blossom in the future.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME MOVIE, IF YOU WERE PRIME FROM THE 80'S LIKE I WAS, GROWING UP WITH POISON, GUNS N ROSES, REO SPEEDWAGON, JOURNEY, DEF LEPPARD AND OF COURSE BON JOVI; Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I AM TALKIN ABOUT!!!  AWESOME JUST SIMPLY ROCK ON DUDETTE!!
B001NA6096|1.0|I only watched this insipid &#34;Chick Flick&#34; becaue some morons gave it good reviews.  Nothing happens.  My wife even hated it.  Dont waste your time.
B008CRC506|5.0|This was a wonderful TV program during season 1 - but, I will not buy Season 2 (it was a flop, in my opinion) - no fault of Amazon, product was exactly as ordered.
B00BLCHYKU|2.0|Who cares about a bunch of dirty, smelly actors running around trying to look like Vikings?  You may like it if you're under the age of 9............... Me? I'll pass.
B00447L4JG|5.0|Enjoyable movie. My 4 yr old granddaughter loves this movie. Does have a scary Halloween<br />theme but she loves it.
B000ZJTPLG|2.0|Sound is not so good. Strange how the gain has to be turned up along with the volume to hear anything.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is fun, a great way to keep all those tidbits of inspiration and lovely that we wish we could keep...now we can and get directly connected with those who are responsible for it...lol
B005CRQ2IU|4.0|This book is great. I've read it many times before. It's a quick read and a very human view of super heroes.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great page turner. Read most Bosch novels and almost expected quality to drop off, not so. Impressed about detailed knowledge of police investigation process. Can't think of anything you might not enjoy if this is your genre.
B000UZQI0Q|3.0|Very slow getting started. Didn't pickup till the end of part four.  I will still get book three so that I can finish the trilogy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this app and the update is the best you get lava and ways and just a plain bucket this app rocks! And please send in more reviews thanks
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Not a bad read. This is more for people who have awful social skills, than for the person who is already well on hurt way. If you already have many friends and find yourself in lots of social situations, you may get bored with this book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|At first, felt it was just another story of the horrible time in our history when humans were subject to slavery but it is well written, some good twists, and was a good read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Awesome game of the foods that are littered littered with burgers burgers and McDonalds or taco taco taco taco taco and filling McDonald as the
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Ez brain teasers that are very addicting. I would recommend this game to everyone. Works great on my kindle fire.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the next book....when will it be released? Another great book that you can't put down, loved it
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Still one of my favorite movies ever. If all you have seen Jim Carrey in is movies like Ace Ventura Pet Detective, you will be very surprised. Along with Ed Harris, he is brilliant in this.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is a great app to keep in touch with your friends. I have found this app very helpful! It is worth the buy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the game is just really fun. I don't want to say everything about this game but just know its great.<br /><br />oh ps its solo addicting
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The ability to draw me in to their pact, their love with all its fears and hopes and surrender was so intense I could hardly breathe at times while reading. This is a MUST read.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This collection fulfilled my high expectations by keeping some of the most important original effects of the fourth, fifth, and sixth episodes. Some changes were made like additions of CGI in certain cut scenes. However, the<br />Star Wars experience was well preserved.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Wonderful modern day approach to a classic series. It sounds like some of the music is similar to the Robert Downey movie series. I would recommend to friends.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This classic was slow in places but really good and was pretty true to the book.  It's worth the watch
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really like this book, much more than I expected.  Maybe it's because I am a nutty pathological optimist like the protagonist, or maybe it's I remember that Eagles season when Jeff Garcia took over as quarterback.  But I think it's because it's a simple, sweet, well-written, creative book.  The characters really came alive for me, and the happy ending somehow worked.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My stepdaughter love's tapping on the screen playing the mini games she starts smiling and gets excited so I just let her play that way she can learn
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I finished book 5 in the Game of Thrones series and needed something very different to read. This was it! A calm, introspective book about human existence. Really enjoyble.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It´s a very interesting game, besides you enjoy it your brain works. Good for your eyes too. Just for fun.
B001EO748M|5.0|I still like season better than Season 2 but Season 2 has so much shock value. Trust me i guarantee you in this season you will be shocked over and over again. The first few episodes aren't that interesting but the last few is where all the action happens.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love the app cause it's simple and easy to use. Comes in very handy and with a bigger screen and buttons I prefer using my Kindle HD over my phone!
B00821OX98|5.0|I can't believe it took me two years to discover this jewel. I initially thought that this would be another series about a post apocalytic world dominated by hostile aliens turning children into zombies. From the start, it became clear to me that this was a serious adventure series involving fundamental values essential to establishing and maintaining a good society in the face of a seeming insurmountable obstacle presented by an alien species whose nature has a complexity that is not immediately apparent. This series pushes all of my buttons. I love science fiction, but I'm also moved by values regarding family, community, courage and character. These are all incorporated into a remarkably well-written, well-acted drama with the highest production values. I can't recommend this series highly enough. Do not just dive into the series in the third season after watching the two season summary on youtube. Start it with season one, episode one and let the story unfold.
B00821OX98|2.0|I had high hopes with this classic theme and the Spielberg name attached. For naught. The sci-fi is part is barely background with most episodes spent watching characters mope around looking sad and lonely. We get it, alien invasions suck. The main character played by Noah Willey represents hope for this band of misfits, but not enough to make me hope the show gets better. The show feels cheap too, with the constant use of a high school as a set. The special effects are adequate. You've got to wonder what it is a great story teller like Spielberg had to do with this.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is so good! Love it! And how it shows up in my status bar and tells me how much I have!
B0062OCNAI|5.0|Life, death, love, hate, dysfunction, and so much more...all marvelously wound into an intricately written mystery.  The twists and turns were difficult to keep straight, even while they kept me guessing who really did what.  Read this one!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The trilogy was an easy read. It seemed too simple at times. The books had riveting experiences and twists, but I feel the writer couldn't convey these experiences fully. The books seemed like they were robotically listing these experiences of a young girl. Aside from that the trilogy was great. This was an interesting story to tell and I think it had a just ending. I smiled when I finished the end and thought that was a great story.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|The basic story is almost submerged in flashy special effects, poor editing, and sentimental scripting.<br />For more reasons why this movie is a failure, read Tolkien's essay &#34;On Fairy Tales&#34; where he discusses the willing suspension of multiple levels of unbelief.
B0014JKJJI|5.0|I am replacing an existing pair of the same style and color that I had purchased for about 35 dollars a year and a half ago. I wear them to work in a kitchen. If this pair lasts just as long as the previous then it was money well spent
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Reading this book made me feel at times almost like I was there in it.  Such a descriptive author, at ease painting pictures with words.  I found the future genetic manipulation by humans controlling and modifying our food system somewhat frightening because it is completely imaginable and most likely already happening.  So glad this was a kindle read because the \\"hold your finger on the word\\"  dictionary came in handy several times.  Wonderfully entertaining reading.  Highly recommended!  After reading this book, I had to devour all his other books as well.  Great story teller!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|could hardly put the book down. His books are the greatest. He keeps the reader in suspense ,traveling all around.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|If you read and enjoyed the books, you won't like the film.  The characters are shallow & the plot is completely different.  You will ask yourself continually, &#34;Why couldn't they stay true to the book?  The book was so good!&#34;
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Enthralling, and like their other Pendergast novels, impossible to put down once you begin reading. This novel cuts to Agent Pendergast's core. The earlier novels are essential to understand the depth of his pain. Puts much into perspective.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I enjoyed the adventure and Enders creativity.  There is a required amount of words, I have said all I want to.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|loved the world of the first book. This one was more depressing. I hope the last book is more uplifting as life is depressing enough!
B002HK9HR8|4.0|An enjoyable film to watch on first and second and third viewing (if so inclined) and great to sit down after and deconstruct for personal filmmaking pleasure.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel, but it certainly took a turn which was unexpected and tested the bounds credulity. Overall though I would recommend.
B002NNA9N0|1.0|I was very disappointed in the movie.  I get the story they were trying to tell, but the f-bombs were dropped constantly by everyone, so I felt that the dialogue was lame.  If it weren't for the beauty of Alec Baldwin and Ed Harris, the movie would have been a completely waste of $1.99.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A novel with a happy ending and a good moral that people of all ages will enjoy reading.  Much better than violent stories that predominate the shelves today.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|The music is the deal with this one which is sung beautifully and performed with feeling.  Such a moving story.
B0058SNKM4|5.0|I ordered these to wear around the house.  The first day that I wore them, I had a few sore spots by the end of the day.  After that first day, however, they've been great.  I can tell that I will get a lot of use out of these.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Having seen the Musicals,and movies ,I just had to read the book finally.  Never did I intend to also read about the Battle of Waterloo and Napoleon and many more side stories.But I worked it through to the end and felt I learned a lot of history of Paris as a city and all components. I was satisfied to know that Jean Valjean came through as a fine man with a good set of values in spite of everything that happened to him. Fascinating story telling of the author.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I've read the books Neverwhere and the Graveyard Book so far.  Neverwhere is still my favorite, but Americans Gods was still excellent.
0783222149|5.0|This is a great Meryl Streep, Kevin Bacon movie. It's a movie I'll enjoy watching many times. Great river rafting scenes.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is the second book I've read by Colleen Hoover and certainly not the last. Not many writers can make me cry and hold my breath but she sure has a grasp on it. Her love of The Avett Brothers only makes me love her more! Thanks for the escape!
B008D28HYS|5.0|Best game of its type anywhere. I have liked. Awesome layout and controls. I own both crossme and crossme color. I have beat all the puzzles and just wish more will come out soon (there are a lot of puzzles, I just play this a lot)! Definitely worth every penny for this app.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|Great, inspiring read that I could not put down. I highly recommend it to anyone, you won't be disappointed at all!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A real page turner, had trouble putting it down. Not to sure I liked the ending, however. Will read her other books.
B00AZKCU7G|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis was very good as Lincoln as noted by his Academy Award.  Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Fields also gave terrific performances as well....Recommended for any Lincoln buff
B005KR6OBM|5.0|To me, this is the best sitcom on TV for the past few years. I saw the second episode on a plane flight from France, and watched three times. Needless to say, I was hooked! Got these to get caught up on the series. While, just like other shows, there are strong and weak episodes, but the former outnumber the latter greatly, and there have been only a couple of episodes I would call bad. The cast is perfect for their parts, and the writing is superb! I cannot recommend this show highly enough!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|The movie wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. The premise is a little off beat and gets off to an extremenly slow start.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Even though I watched the shows live, I got this so I could re-watch episodes, as this is a series I can watch over and over. I can't recommend this show enough.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I read all the reviews and knew I was NOT getting a vacuum cleaner. This is a lightweight electric broom and it works great.  Small enough to fit behind my kitchen cart out of sight.  The battery lasts about a week and I use it every day to pick up crumbs and the grass and leaves tracked in from the garage.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sweet,awesome,fun,great,cool subway surfers  cool I love all the characters and everything i like how there is an update to this game and it changes the background and it has sooooooooo many details and stuff like that :)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great story line kept me interested didn't want to put it down read it in 3 days. Will read more from this author.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Read it in one sitting. I simply could not stop and would do it all again. Much better and deeper than the movie.
1616284382|5.0|Any true Disney fanatic will fall in LOVE with this book! A must-buy! The pictures are gorgeous and the history just makes me appreciate the company and its work that much more.
147674355X|3.0|Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />I liked the first half of the book.  But the second half.....that's a different story.  Literally.<br /><br />I didn't understand how Holder or any of the characters his age spoke as if they were mature adults.  He is eighteen! I WISH the guys I went to high school with spoke or acted like that!<br /><br />Secondly, it CONSTANTLY bothered me how Hope at age four or five or Holder at age six spoke as if they were eleven years old.  \\"You know sometimes when your daddy makes you cry?  Will you promise me that when he makes you sad, you'll think about the sky?\\"  ............are you kidding me?  They kept referring to Sky as Holder and his sister's very best friend.  I know she was kidnapped and all, but kids move on... I don't think it would have such a huge effect on a six year old child to the point where they're \\"still looking for them\\" after 13 years......but that's just me.<br /><br />The second half of the book in general just bothered me with the amount of deep, cheesy conversations between Holder and Sky.  \\"You are so strong, I love you so much, you are always there for me.\\"  After a few thousand of those conversations, WE GET IT.<br /><br />I'd also have to agree with the low-rated reviews with how the character name choices were ridiculous.  Her best friend's name is Six...need I say more?<br /><br />However, this would have been a good book for me to read during high school.  I don't think as much would bother younger audiences.  I liked the beginning of the book, and Holder in the beginning in general.  I could guess early on that she was sexually abused, though.  But I will admit there was a lot I didn't see coming.<br /><br />Overall, the book was just OK.  I don't think it deserves an \\"OH MY GOD THIS BOOK IS SO HORRIBLE\\" rating.  After all, it is fiction.  You have to let your imagination stretch a little with any fiction book :)
B007D48ASU|5.0|Our daughter (21 months) had me read this book three times in a row as soon as I opened the package.  She loved it!  Even better, 5 minutes later she took her first tinkle in the potty all by herself!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Disappointed about the ending. To many questions unanswered. Please give the continued story soon. What goes on in California, who moved the braclet to the mob guys wrist. Need to know!
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|What else to say beyond the fact that somehow, after a terribly long break, BOC is back with an album that fits perfectly in the musical pantheon they've been working at for nearly two decades.  Both a a jump forward and call back to their earliest work, Tomorrow's Harvest is a one of a kind album that feels both like a long-lost artifact and a totally relevant reflection of today.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Great series. So much happens from episode to episode. Wonderful characters. Can't wait to see season three! This is a must watch!
B00821OX98|5.0|I never watch TV shows but this show really caught my attention and it is so good! You'll have to watch it to believe me.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I love this game and I think its great but I can't  get the new levels for cloud city because every time I try to open cloud city it takes me out of the app and this upsets me.
B00005JKGO|5.0|This masterpiece by Fellini should rank alongside Seven Samurai, Battleship Potemkin, and Rules of the Game as one of the best foreign language movies ever made. Just calling it the best Italian movie of all time doesn't do it justice. I must admit that I was bored while watching it but I couldn't take my eyes off of it and the reason is because I got caught up in the mania of everything that was going on in the movie. What struck me was how surrounded the protagonist was on the outside but was also lonely on the inside. He was pretty sympathetic I must say. It seems almost as if he is afraid of being bored and getting old, so as a result, he transforms into this outgoing socialite who just can't help himself. The pleasures of the upper-class are just too tempting to pass up. After all, this is the \\"good life\\" right? A whole lot better than what the poor and middle-class are going through. Although Mastroianni gives an unforgettable performance, Fellini is the real star here. The close-ups and camera angles are all perfect. This is a work of expert craftsmanship. Not only is the movie amazing on a technical level, but it also shows true vision as well. He shows that the rich are just like you and me with the only exception being the possession of money. They do what the rest of us \\"normal\\" people do for fun: they dance, they sing, they drive around (sounds boring, but in the hands of Fellini even THAT has a romantic allure to it), they sit around and listen to music, they drink (boy, do they EVER), and yes, they have sex (the sex is implied in the movie, it was 1960 after all). What Fellini is trying to show us all is that being rich isn't what it's cracked up to be and even (or in Fellini's point-of-view, especially) the rich can be dull and mundane. I usually like my movies to have some sort of plot. This one does not. It rambles, almost in a drunken kind of sense, but that is part of the appeal. As far as \\"rambling\\" movies go, this is probably the best one ever made. It just paints a picture, but the picture has a purpose. I recommend a drink or two while viewing. Drink along with the characters. Trust me, it will be an experience.ade. It just paints a picture, but the picture has a purpose. I recommend a drink or two while viewing.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|This helps explain why I tended to avoid the group activities in Grad school--just the day of groups wore me out.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|City of Ashes is the second book in the Mortal Instruments series.  The book is fast paced and full of action.  It was hard to put down.  When I finished, I could not wait to start the next book.  Overall, the book was great and the series is wonderful.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This is a Romeo/Juliet love story with an interesting Zombie twist.  I think it falls definitely into the chick flick category and I am surprised my husband stayed awake.  Anyway, I liked it.  While it was a bit hard to wrap your mind around hanging out with someone who likes to eat your friends, R was a really likeable character and the mostly subtle humor just added to the movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|There aren't many books I can't put down but this is one of them. Seriously shocking, entertaining, crazy and twisted. The description doesn't do it justice but I guess they can't have any spoilers either.
1439130833|5.0|I read this every day and it seems some days that the teachings were all about me it is so interesting and I am a better person by it
1623420148|3.0|I read this book after seeing tons and tons of fabulous reviews but I just didn't love it.  I can see why people would love it, its just not for me I guess.<br /><br />Drew is a man whore who like to get around but his career is #1.  He meets Kate at a bar and tries to pick her up even though he tells her he is engaged.  She ends up being the new person that got hired at his firm.  They fight and compete like crazy and he ends up falling for her. There was a lot that was funny in this book but it just didn't do it for me.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was an amazing historical fiction book! I loved the way how Death was telling the story about a young girl who would steal books in the time of WW2. There was a very neat perspective because usually, books wouldn't be put in Death's view. I loved Death and Liesel because they were the most interesting to read about!!<br />-Bea Chen :-)
B0081336FO|5.0|Another winner from the UK. Best version of Sherlock Holmes yet. I like the movie format rather than the 40 minutes of program and 20 minutes of commercials like most of the drivel on television today.
B0073XV2W2|3.0|I enjoy Daniel's books a great deal. I have read Daemon and Freedom and enjoyed them tremendously. Although I enjoyed Kill Decision i dont feel its nearly as good as his previous two books. This one is much more militaristic and less cyber-thriller focused. Its a quick, entertaining read with great action scenes and given recent events, seems stunningly plausible. The characters arent very well fleshed out and some of the dialogue is clunky. But otherwise I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys whip-quick action and a fun read.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|...love Alicia and Will. Peter is getting better. Kalinda is a puzzle. also, love the costumes. And the music. Great show
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Best of the series so far. Can't put it down. The first two are wonderful, but the series, the history, the character development really shows in this book. Phenomenal.
0553801473|5.0|I got so addicted to this series.  The books are far better than the show. My only complaint is who knows how long I will need to wait for book 6!
0345529057|5.0|The first book is identical to the first season of the TV show almost scene for scene but still a great read and allowed me to understand a lot of things that went over my head when watching the show. I'm now in the second book and that's where the TV show and the book start to have a lot more differences and I'm enjoying the book even more!!!<br />An awesome saga!
0446585041|4.0|Only four stars because I haven't finished it yet.  I do have to say I like this one better than the first one.  I do like Ellen though, she's got a huge heart and she's a really good person.
B00976MZYM|4.0|I'm always looking for new music to workout to, and this was a great addition!  I hope I can find more like this one.
B005HEPN06|5.0|Brings me back to childhood and watching this with the fam.  Always clean, usually taking the high moral road, and fun.  Deanna Troi episodes are always a bit dramatic ;)

B004XDYJRU|1.0|Nothing special, not very user friendly. Just too many user options for me, I don't want or need access to the whole world just the US is fine. Will not update, 5.00 wasted. :-)
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book  is a must read if you are even remotely interested in realizing your awesome human potential  and having a fulfilling life at every level which is yours to have with the simple and timeless techniques presented in the book , practice of which must destroy your old lackful  and limiting mental models which are the main cause of our suffering in this day and age.<br />It's a great family read.- the techniques entire family can practice together, have fun, explore their potentials and grow to a higher level by understanding life and themselves.
B004YF6MHW|3.0|It basically does what its meant to. But I couldn't get to the settings to change the ISO, and I was hoping to have spot metering available. Back to the stock camera for me.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This is a quirky little puzzler with solid game design, good theme and a nice metagame. Worth playing. Kids love it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game has beautiful graphics and cheap prices for items if you want to pay however it isn't necessary if uoh want to take the Tim's to grow everything . I love it!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a story for all ages. All young ladies over age 16 should read this love story. It captivates and holds your heart. You want to know what,why when and how. I want to know all about Holder. Can't wait for the second in the series.<br />Bravo
B007CF7L9O|5.0|Check the measurements, this one is HUGE!  It's so big and sturdy that my 2 year old and 3 year old take turns riding it's back, no joke!  Hands down currently their favorite dino.  Beautiful details and paint job.  My son's face just LIT UP when he saw it and he hasn't stopped playing with it!!!!!!!!This one is an absolute must buy!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Wool was a good story.  Not hard to read.  Lots of characters that can probably have their own story in other books.  I thought there was a lot of extra &#34;filler&#34; to make the book bigger but it was entertaining enough.
B00192IV9U|3.0|The king of pop is one of the greatest of all time but he's dead you shouldn't take recordings  of the mans voice if he's passed on
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A really good film for the family.  It shows the love and dedication that a pet will give. I highly recommend this movie. Just be prepared to keep some tissues handy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the intensity and the mystery incased in this extraordinary book will forever and ever love this exciting story
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|Once started the game would freeze up,  The only way to exit was to shut down the devise completely.  Very frustrating for the kids.
B00AYHK7RU|5.0|My husband loves Bowie so I purchased this CD for him.  It is a great album and we have enjoyed it very much.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|It is easy, but additive. It takes a long.time to finish it, but it is good that you can stop and start  at the same spot .
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Most of the time when a book is made into a movie, fans of the book are disappointed.  Even those who get that something has to be cut from the average novel to make a movie that the average movie-goer is willing to sit through are usually unhappy with what was cut.  But I've got to say that this movie does an excellent job of keeping the essential plot, characters, and feel of the novel.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B0060D0OWA|5.0|I loved this movie !!! Jake Gyllenhaal is so witty and handsome and I love all the shots that were done... simply superb !!
B00004XPPK|5.0|This love-hate-love relationship story is a terrific drama.  It is the movie that made me wonder whether or not Rita Hayworth might just have been the most beautiful of all Hollywood stars.  I had the pleasure a few years after this movie came out in 1946 of traveling with her co-star, Glen Ford, and his wife Eleanor Powell, on a ship bound for South America.  I spent two weeks with them and their son Peter Ford on a wonderful ocean voyage - can't do it like that anymore!.  Ford made a lot of good movies and this is no exception.  George Macready is an excellent &#34;heavy&#34; and the little philosopher at the club sidelined a mildly philosophical view of the intrigue and romance.  Excellent movie!
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|Though Hans Zimmer's \\"Man of Steel\\" soundtrack is disappointing to those (like myself) who bought the hype that this soundtrack was going to be something truly different and unique from Zimmer's recent blockbuster score style in the vein of \\"Inception\\" and \\"Dark Knight\\", there are still enough epic and thrilling moments, with enough hope piercing the brooding darkness occasionally, to warrant a purchase. Overall, the 12 piece drum orchestra is thrilling, though not as different as would have been expected (in fact, some of the drum beats are lifted directly from the masterful \\"King Arthur\\" soundtrack), the arrangements are still synth-powered orchestrations, and the ethereal soundscapes sometimes venture a bit too close to \\"Inception\\" territory.<br />However, when the Kryptonian choral elements come into full power with the driving drums and powerful brass, the results are truly epic enough in scale to make up for the mundane familiarity of the rest of the score. The middle section of the score is a work of brilliance, far overshadowing the mediocre opening and closing parts. A haunting, beautiful melody for Krypton is hummed by a female vocalist on \\"Goodbye My Son\\", merging beautifully with the choir, which follows into the magnificently urgent and heroic \\"If You Love These People\\", a driving tune of heroism in classic Zimmer style: driving percussion, frantic string ostinatos, noble brass, massive choral, and hints of guitar acting in the role of a classical string section (one Zimmer innovation on the record that shows up rarely but effectively). This leads into the tragic string lament of \\"Krypton's Last\\" which precedes the nine minute epic track \\"Terraforming\\" which places the motifs of Superman, Zod and Krypton in epic contention with each other for a powerful ride that builds to an almost religious crescendo.<br />Aside from this tour de force of a midsection, however, \\"Man of Steel\\" is rather standard Zimmer fare. One can pass on the deluxe edition and not worry about missing much music worth having (unless one really wants the steel case for the CD, which I must say is a brilliant idea. Kudos to the steelcase design. Clever and hardy, I hope more soundtracks will pick up on this idea). The highlights are the aforementioned midsection, and the soundtrack works brilliantly within the film.<br /><br />EDIT: On several more listenings, the theme for General Zod has really begun to stand out to me. Really menacing string ostinato with some great brass that portrays an angered nobility with a villainous twist. It shows up on part of \\"Terraforming\\" towards the end, gets its most magnificent and bombastic performance on \\"I Will Find Him\\", and is explored and featured most prominently on the aptly named \\"General Zod\\" and \\"Arcade\\" on the Deluxe Edition. So perhaps give the Zod theme a listen before determining whether you want the Deluxe or not. If you like the Zod theme as much as I do, might be worth a purchase.
B004FWPK8G|3.0|This was funny as usual and sported a good cast.  It reminded me a little in its theme about the military of what happened in HAIR, luckily without the same consequences.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This is a really good YouTube app. It looks great, the videos look great. Why does this app have a low rating? If adds appear on the screen while the video is playing, pause it and then play it. They'll go away.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it four stars is because it freezes up sometimes. Not a lot, just sometimes.<br /><br />This is so worth downloading! Don't let the ratings fool you!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Really addicting! I enjoyed it so much! I end buying it by sheer luck. I was searching about Chia Seeds and Pinole and what and how the Tarahumara eat them. First, I got the free sample from Amazon. Then, I realized I couldn't help to buy the book and began reading, gulping, reading as running, even I didn't leave my house except to go to my work (I'm an MD with a lot of joint pains and targeted to do anything but stay quiet between work and home).<br />Now, I feel alive, and even I'm quite 64yo, I had rediscovered the pleasure of imagining running for the first time in years. Not that I have already begin to run, but, I sense I can do it as soon as I recover from a bad bowel infection.<br />Folks: don't dare to miss this awesome book!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great app.<br />Love playing this game. Would totally recommend this game to people who love bingo games. You won't be disappointed.
B003477DVK|5.0|My Dog Skip is an old fashioned coming of age story set during World War II on the home front. Based upon the semi-autobiographical book, Will is an undersized bookworm trying to fit in with the more physical kids and trying to live up to his image of his hero, the local star athlete who is leaving for the war. His relationship with his dog brings him to deal with others and to become a man. There is reality and humor in this heartwarming story.

B00284G2IA|3.0|Other reviewers are spot on about the quality of this concert. I just wanted to add that this Blu-ray is a 720p recording and only features a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. No 1080p or DTS-HD lossless audio to be found here. I think it's the first Blu-ray I've seen where they seem to have forgotten to use all that extra disc space... :(
B00CRW2066|3.0|I loved their previous 3 albums and each had at least one song that was droning, lacking in melody, and collapsed under its own weight.  This album has several like that, and none as good as the best of their previous efforts.  This is, of course, my opinion.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Love it, can't want to read the next one!  Also watched the series and Will resume in September. Will be waiting
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed this game. Love the mysteries around each turn. Very entertaining my children and I had fun going through the different realms.
B008OOYALE|3.0|The screen went blue after a few minutes play and I could not get it to reset. I am trying to remove it from my Kindle.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Written in the same style as his other books Khaled tells a gripping story of what life in Afghanistan in 1952 means for families who live in poverty through the deepest winters.  Decisions and sacrifices that have to be made to save the family and the bond between brother and sister.  The story spans many years and generations and to families rich and poor.  It moves from Afghanistan to Paris and America before all the intricate layers come together.  An interesting read and an unforgettable story.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Easy to play the family enjoys it. Though to get all the things you might need in the game to beat it looks like you will need to spend some money
B005PK57NU|4.0|A good series pertinent to what's happening in the US today....I love lawyer shows but the material for this one was getting confusing and harder to follow...not sure how long this series will last
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game. My three year old and fourteen year old love it. Realistic graphics and teaches how to be responsible for each horse.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It was a cute movie!  A good way to pass a rainy afternoon, or an evening when TV has nothing on worth watching.  I enjoyed it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I'm a little disappointed with the ending/epilogue. All the build up on Katniss/Gale relationship for nothing; Peeta just had to stick around for her to be chosen.
0143122916|4.0|Best value was getting information from only person to have experienced Camp 14 and lived to tell about it.  Wanted to know so much more and blew through the little book in one sitting.  Author had a unique perspective and I imagine it was difficult getting subject to reveal much but it was so capsulized.  I think I would have written it differently.
0425263991|5.0|This has been my most anticipated releases this year, and Nalini sure does deliver. The story is complex, nuanced and so so romantic. LOVE IT!<br /><br />*SPOILERS ahead*<br /><br />Kaleb has always been one of my obsessions in this series. He is an amazingly \\"gray\\" character where you are always unsure of where he stands. I loved that this book tells us where he stands but doesn't make him a straightforward character. I really liked his backstory because it does explain so much about him and the decisions he has made so far. His relationship with Sahara is beautifully written - there is the innocence of first love combined with the bone-deep passion you have for the \\"one\\". On top of all this, we finally know who the Ghost is and get to the \\"end\\" of Silence. I am just super excited to be on this journey with Nalini and am really looking forward to seeing where she takes us from here.
B00B9LNK5G|5.0|I really enjoyed John's first CD, but actually like this one even better. What's so interesting here is the instrumentals. Very unique, and I enjoy that so much of the individual songs have long instrumentals with interesting segways and seem to reflect the feelings expressed in the song lyrics.  There are several styles of songs here and that adds to the enjoyment.  Would recommend this CD to anyone looking for a fresh and contemporary music style.
1601251831|4.0|Like most Pathfinder books it has great art and a nice clean page layout that makes it easy to read stats.  It includes most of the common monsters from the oldest rpg around and it gives guidelines for making new monsters.  This and the core rulebook are pretty much all that's needed to start GMing a Pathfinder game.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I'll be honest -- I read this book thinking I would hate it. As mother of two young children, trying to finish my PhD, teaching classes, writing papers for publication, doing professional development for teachers, applying for jobs, cleaning my house, doing the laundry etc. I initially found the idea of &#34;leaning in&#34; offensive. I mean, I'm trying. I'm really, really trying to do good things, to lead, and to be a good parent and I didn't much relish the idea of Sandberg telling me that I needed to just &#34;lean in&#34; to my work, to &#34;step up&#34; or to &#34;sit at the table&#34;. I had read reviews that suggested Sandberg's focus was solely on changes that women, as individuals, could make to alter their trajectories in career and at home. That, to me, also just seemed offensive. The United States is woefully behind other developed nations in recognizing the importance of paid parental leave for family health. The US provides no paid parental leave as a matter of policy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave I'll be frank. I think it's inhumane that government provides no paid support to parents at a time when they are especially vulnerable psychologically, emotionally and financially. I was afraid Sandberg had utterly dismissed the policy issues that have, to my mind, forced women -- even extremely ambitious and well-educated women -- to make difficult choices. To my surprise, although Sandberg spends most of the book encouraging women to be critical of the ways they've been socialized, she does make a very direct call to companies and governments to change policies in ways that would enable women to achieve true equality. When I read her stance here, I felt that I could listen to the rest. And, you know, she's done good work. I really liked this book. I think Sandberg's is an important voice for women to hear. I also really hope that Sandberg uses her social capital to advocate for much-needed policy shifts nationally so that women have the spaceto make real choices and don't feel forced into decisions about work and family one way or another.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I HEARD THE CD TONIGHT. I GIVE A RATING OF 5 STARS.  THE SOUND IS GREAT. THE TITLES AQND LYRICS ARE VERY PERSONAL. I BEEN WAITING 35 YEARS TO SEE OZZY BACK.WITH THE GROUP MAKING A RECORD TOGETHER.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS.
B00992CF6W|5.0|On the next update there's Gonna be cakes,Cow spawners,Sheep spawners,Pig spawners, and Chicken spawners too!!! I have an ipod touch 4th generation and they updated it!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan 4 stars<br /><br />Delightful!  Such a good book-the plot is fantastical and fantastic:  Clay loses his job and comes to work as a night clerk in Mr. Penumbra's bookstore.  From tall, shadowy bookshelves containing strange books to mysterious customers that are logged with great attention to detail, this story just unfolds and doesn't stop!  I liked the mix of high-tech and print books.  There is a quest and some quirky characters help in the fun.  Google features prominently in the story in a good way.  There is romance that actually plays out like they sometimes do in real life.  My only critique is the writing style is a little stark, I would have liked more showing instead of telling the story but all in all a great read that would be a fantastic movie.  4 stars.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Tried to play this on the Kindle Fire, but these kinds of games are hard to play on it because of the screen being so small. I have the 7&#34; screen.  You can't really find items that easily.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really enjoy this show. The actors do a great job of getting you to love them or hate them. Each episode is intriguing. I watch on Roku, so it's great to watch them one after the other.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like this game.  I pretty much like any match 3 game especially since it's a game you can play alone without friends or requests from friends.
B00AYCOUOG|4.0|After the slightly disappointing album \\"A New Morning\\" and a ten-year hiatus,  Suede are back in fine form with the album \\"Bloodsports\\". The group sound is intact and there are not immediately noticeable differences in their sound anno 2013 compared to \\"Coming Up\\" - the group's biggest commercial success; maybe no big surprise considering that the line-up is the same.<br /><br />The album starts off with three typical Suede rockers, with singable melodies. Especially the opening track \\"Barriers\\" has something special and magnificent - this clearly must be a new fan favorite. \\"Snowblind\\" and \\"It Starts and Ends with you\\" come close to those of \\"Barriers\\" and both are fine numbers.<br /><br />Less typical is \\"Sabotage\\", which is a song that wins on closer acquaintance.<br /><br />Among the actual ballads we find \\"For the Strangers\\" and \\"Sometimes I Feel I'll Float Away\\" - both songs in familiar Suede arrangements - and both great songs. \\"What are you not Telling Me\\" and \\"Faultlines\\" are more special and less accessible - perhaps slightly pompous.<br /><br />\\"Always\\" is very cute, but not particularly memorable.<br /><br />\\"Hit Me\\", which is selected as a single, is a pretty simple rocker, which almost sounds like an outtake from \\"Coming Up\\". My choice for a single would have been \\"Barriers\\".<br /><br />It seems the most catchy songs are placed first on the album, and that the new ideas are mostly assigned to the last part of the album.<br /><br />At any rate very nice to have Suede back.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|The battery application is very helpful. I am able to know immediately how long until I need to recharge my kindle.
B00D3V85FA|1.0|Been a Sabbath fan since 12yrs old. Couldn't wait for it. Listened to all Ozzy Sabbath albums for months. And then bought what turned out to be a bad sequel to Ozzmosis. Maybe it'll grow on me. But it seems like this \\"reunion\\" was more of a money maker idea rather than a \\"for love of the music\\" type of thing. If you listen hard enough you could here shades of vintage Sabbath. I just expected something way different. Like.... Something Good.
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|This 3rd novel I thought was not as well written as the other two as it was very predicable and left you in no suspense which was a bit of a let down as the others were very exciting.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Enough surprises and twists to keep readers' engaged until the last escapade on the last page in a satisfying, deliciously tight plot.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this game and spent my entire night and morning playing it. I can't wait for the next one!
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|It's a pretty fun game but gets boring after a while downloaded it for my cousins and they said they didn't really like it......
B005OCFGTO|4.0|You get all eight movies ... for under $40—quite a bargain if you ask me. They're the regular, theatrical editions. There are no special features. It was exactly what I wanted and expected. If you're looking for more, this won't be the collection.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I hope Sylvia is right about it not taking long for the next book to come out. Ended too abruptly to hv to wait to long. I really enjoyed it tho.
1781162646|5.0|I won's say too much because this is an exquisite jewel from the Master Stephen King. A ghost story, a murder mystery, an historical novel of recent history; evocative of time and place.  It is a beautiful story and will become one of my best beloved. If you are looking for the Shinning, or It, or The Stand, you won't find it.  It is not that kind of story, but it is one of King's best.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I am almost through the first season it hasn't taken me more than a week to watch it because it is that good! my husband has already seen all the seasons but he is rewatching the series with me he liked it so much.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Reflects historical period I love.  British productions are more subtle than American films and television drama.  Love more of this genre.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|This is a gift......so I don't know yet how it is liked.  However, person receiving loves NCIS and has asked for all the seasons........so think they will enjoy it.l
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|This movie just did not capture and hold my attention.  Too many witches to keep up with!  The best character was the monkey sidekick.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|A great little app; got it on my tablet, kindle and phone.  Find a wi-fi,, connect, view the data, sort the ap for the best one.  easy, quick and free.<br /><br />history and data storage or public database share would make it perfect.
1781162646|5.0|JOYLAND is a terrific summer novel from author Stephen King, who can still churn `em out nearly 40 years after the publication of CARRIE. JOYLAND is published as a trade paperback in the Hard Case Crime series and is as pulpy as King can get, meaning it's much more accessible than the Don Westlake and Jim Cain books published under the imprint. Taking a break from monsters, at least supernatural ones, JOYLAND is the story of the summer of 1973 when Devin \\"Jonesey\\" Jones, a UNH student, takes a job at a second-tier amusement park on the coastal waters of southern North Carolina. As always, King gets the period details right, with a delightful cast of characters, using the jargon of the carnies to punctuate King's always steady writing hand. I remember in the 1990s devouring the true crime book LOBSTER BOY about the death of sideshow long stay Grady Stiles Jr. There is a phrase in that book: \\"Carny Folk are Good Folk,\\" though for Stiles that wasn't the case. JOYLAND on the other hand is full of carnies (or carny-from-carny, meaning second generation) who just want to show the \\"rubes\\" a good time. There is also a chilling ghost story (\\"the fun house of fear\\") and a DRAGON TATTOO-like mystery, all handled deftly and integrated seamlessly into the narrative. I've written before of King's flawed endings, but JOYLAND is a singular delight from beginning to end and makes for a pleasing summer read!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Picoult  is one of the best storytellers around!  This one grabs you and doesn't let go.  The title belies the deeply complicated moral conflict explored within these pages.  The story flows effortlessly, but remains with you long after you put this book down.  A must read for those of us who think we &#34;know' all the answers.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|Grant & Hepburn are the classic romantic comedy couple.  Jimmy Stewart won an Oscar for his role as the newsman.  Lots of laughs and style...worth seeing over and over again!
B007SOQBCM|5.0|I use this app almost everyday, its works well and very functional. I would recommend it to any one. v
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It moved fast enough to keep it interesting. A little different from most movies I watch.  Somewhat of a surprising ending.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I haven't seen the movie, but the book only did one thing for me..helped me sleep like a baby. If you are really into Philly Eagles football, perhaps this is a good read
B00B2YH7BS|4.0|I knew that The Valley was an important spot for 70s, 80s, & 90s rock music.  I just did not know that it was right in the center of where I grew up, went to shcool, and worked only a few miles away.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Not finished with this one. but I can say yes. I am enjoying this. Great if you<br />believe in god. I have cancer and I am enjoying reading half way through. Kris
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Thought these young actors/actresses did a pretty good job overall. I did think the storyline was pretty weird though. Overall, a  decent movie.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Makes you wonder what the pilot did the day, week or year before you get on a plane with him in the cockpit!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I assumed author's research was well founded and the book was more than a political statement.<br />The pointed humor relieves the horror, but cannot eliminate the truth and reality.<br />Still, an interesting read and worth the time.
B005MP28B2|3.0|It was a difficult film to watch.  The father depicted in the film was certainly not &#34;father of the year&#34;.  The son was brave and gutsy.
B00AQM8H9I|1.0|Really?  The title says it all, after all what's left after boring?  Good maybe for a young child but not suitable for adults.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Who wouldn't like Chris Evans shirtless? But seriously, good movie. I would recommend it to everyone who likes superhero movies.
B005C9YZIW|3.0|I have long been a fan of David Attenborough but this series was a real letdown.  Zev Toledano's three star July 24, 2007 review does a good job explaining why.  I felt like the producers did not structure the series on the basis of, \\"What would be important to know about Planet Earth?\\"  Instead they asked, \\"What cool footage do we have?  In particular, what cool footage do we have that no one has gotten before?\\"<br /><br />One result of this: Though the series is about life on Planet Earth, there is little about the 90% of life that is made up of plants.  Plants mostly don't move and don't make for cool footage.<br /><br />BTW: the Six-Disc Special Edition contains everything (and more!) that people complained was missing from the original DVD set.
034580404X|5.0|I think this book should be compulsary reading for all males 15 and older to learn how to please a woman. I have given away two sets of the books already.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It is a very original format of a timeless story.  It is well written and holds the reader's interest throughout.
B0098466CK|4.0|I saw them in May for the first time, sound just like their albums live.  They even covered ZZTop. Definitely Sabbath inspired. This cd is pretty good.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This has become one of my all time favorite films, I have always wanted to be a bigger fish than I am, you should watch it !!!!
B008Y73940|4.0|Thought it was a good movie.  It really demanded your attention and it kept you in suspense as to what was going to happen next. It keep you guessing.  I enjoyed it.
B0094M2S5A|4.0|This us a movie than makes you laugh and cry. Have been watching it for years now. Our family suggests this movie to all.
B009439HEY|5.0|I don't care that it's more of a cover project. As a guitarist this is the way Genesis SHOULD HAVE sounded... with Steve Hackett's guitars more up front in the mix.  Overall the recording and mixing is SO much better too, much more dynamic than the original recordings.  The variety in lead singers is refreshing.  Some of these songs never sounded so good.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|My husband asked me to order this one for him and he is very happy to have received it.  Another good choice from Amazon!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Loved this book - but did not realize that the next book would not be out until September.  Can't wait to read it.
B009NX409M|5.0|This is a story about two individuals who travel on Metro North together and in spite of themselves, fall in love.  They are both married and try to stay true to the marriages.  No bad language or violence, making this a good old fashioned movie.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is one of the most exciting TV series that I've seen.  The visuals are rapidfire, but make the story even edgier.
B007ZCOT6C|3.0|Character a bit younger than me so harder to follow than some.  Still really enjoyed the book though and interested in her other books for sure
B002WSASIC|5.0|Although some of the scenes should be cut, this should be required viewing for high school students.  The cruelty and senselessness of racism is portrayed without sparing anyone's feelings.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I searched all over the stores and on the internet for the perfect cover for my Kindle Fire HD. I found it! This cover has every feature that I wanted. Easy to use, great quality. Couldn't ask for more. Thanks for making it.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|The movie is long and boring. I did understand to story. Maybe it's just me, but I don't recommend it.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Game is fun. Just wish the aura generated quicker so there was no need to purchase more. Great graphics and storyline.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I really enjoy Suits. It's not the greatest TV show of all time, or even a Top 10 TV show, but I love it because it is entertaining. There are some things I dislike, such as the House style &#34;eureka&#34; moments for solving how to win a case, and some of the things about what they say Mike should have learned in law school are not what you learn in law school. It's still a fun show to watch though, and it's easy to overlook its flaws.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Shameful but I am sure a lot of this stuff happens in real life....dirty cops!  Most of the actors are good with a few not so good.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I downloaded this app cos it was free and I would not have been upset if I had paid for it great clues good fun just difficult enough but not so much that you give up just wish It was longer
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows and since I gave up Directv, I have to pay to watch it but I am willing to do that, I like it that much and look forward to season 5.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|when I saw this picture the first time I wanted to get it on DVD and now I got it and the same day I received I got my grandson to see it excellent
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I didn't watch this in prime time but once I started watching it through Amazon Prime I had to watch all 8 seasons.
B003YNFYCO|4.0|First, I was never a big Beatles fan and after listening to this I remembered why I didn't buy many of their records when I was younger, although it was nice hearing some of these songs again.<br />  Second, there certainly could have been a much better mixing, as many others have pointed out, the technology does exists and probably has for years.<br />  Overall it's a decent CD however some of the songs were not worth while listening to, such as Yellow Submarine while others, like In My Life and Yesterday, were worth while listening to several times.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. I am hoping when I finish the last free level I won't be so addicted that I need to buy more!
B0090EJR1K|1.0|This film is a huge waste of time. I'm perfectly fine with racist jokes, crude humor, \\"non-political correctness\\", but  this film just isn't funny. It's stupid. His fake-ass accent is annoying and stupid. The plot is stupid. The cast is stupid. Thanks to prime, I'm very lucky I didn't have to spend a dime to watch this movie (I didn't finish it).
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This game is pretty cool. Build a disease and take over the world.  It is a fun game, worth the price.
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|This Movie take you on a fun fantastical adventure of Giants  and knights. I thought the animation was  good and storyline was fun.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is a great book. Kept me on the edge of my seat  wanting to keep reading more!! Definitely recommend especially if you liked Gone Girl. Go for it!
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Have thoroughly enjoyed the entire series.<br />Theodore is an absolutely adorable and careing character.<br /><br />Look forward to all future stories on Theodore<br />Always enjoyed nancy drew growing up but this character is wonderful<br />Keep writing !!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Bought if for my ten-year-old's Kindle Fire and he loves it.  We went on a long car ride the other day, and usually he gets restless.  Temple Run: Oz kept him busy the entire ride.  Mike LaMontagne, Author Wizard of Oz: Dark Witch Rising trilogy
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Fun informative surprising.... And that's just the flower meanings. The storyline was also very good, gripping and will keep you turning the page
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read the book and then saw the movie, even with great performances, the book is way better. A lot of changes give the movie a different feel and character profile.<br />It's a great book to read to keep a positive viewpoint.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|Really cool band that makes really cool music. The singers voices are so sexy and sweet at the same time.I highly recommend it! Buy it now.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Not so much a comedy as a drama, but very good none the less. Very original plot, and the ending was nice. Recommend it!
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My 5 year old is usually pretty good at getting lego sets together, but he needed help with this one, which was fine.  I thought it was great in detail and my son LOVED it for his birthday.  There are LOTS of TINY pieces, but that was fie with us.  Overall if this is for someone who loves Minecraft...they'll love it.
B003XURDAY|4.0|I actually bought this movie for my husband. I love sci-fi movies, but this one is my husband's favorite. Great movie for the time period it was made.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a fast read and it kept me engrossed until the end.  I enjoyed reading the entire Hunger Games series.  Thank you!
0062200909|5.0|I love the Lord of the Rings. I mean I am a hard core fan. So, when I saw this book and it's sequel at Barnes and Noble I had to look here on Amazon for a slightly cheaper version. I love both of the books.
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|Since it's based on a dice game, there's a lot of random luck involved. Good strategy can overcome it most of the time, but not every time.<br /><br />Still, this is afun, challenging game and well worth the price,
B00009TB5G|5.0|I love the Lord of the Rings. I mean I am a hard core fan. So, when a friend of mine began bragging that they had the extended editions, I had to buy them too, SO WORTH IT!
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|This is one of Disney's last animated greats. The story is cheesy and predictable, but the characters are great, hilarious, and the score is light, fun, and exciting.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|A must have movie. Awesome fight scenes, great story, I love everything about this movie. I recommend this to anyone.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Excellent starter book.  Now I need more investing books.  I hope his other books are as helpful.Thank you rich dad.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Recommend to anybody who wants a change of pace book. Gets you thinking and extremely entertaining. Really enjoyed reading it and great for many many ages
1616550414|5.0|I bought the Japanese version last year cause I didnt know whether the English version will be coming out or not, I was happy with the the arts alone but I dont understand all the words. That said, I bought 2 copies of this book and I just received it today, to my surprise the size is bigger than the Japan version and the cover is better too! I'm aware people has already reviewed this book to the core so I would just write this review to say I'm very satisfied with this book!<br /><br />If you're Zelda fans I dont see any reason not to get this. Perhaps the timeline is the only one that hardcore fans will argue and always will no matter what. Sadly, the fact is there's contradiction but at the same time every game often shows connection with other games which causing the confusion. However if you disagree with the game creator then I have nothing more to say :)
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Love this movie!! I could watch it over and over again. I would recommend this movie to anyone to watch.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a great overhaul of the original Temple Run with added features and customization that still remains faithful to the original gameplay and style of the first.<br /><br />Graphically it has seen an immense upgrade in quality and atmosphere, with surroundings almost being distracting and functioning as an obstacle themselves.<br /><br />Tilting seems to be a little stiffer in responsiveness, and the minutely shifting camera angles along the paths are a minor nuisance.<br /><br />Further inclusion of the extra characters is neat, as well as utilizing their unique abilities in gameplay.<br /><br />I think this is what Temple Run is meant to be.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|This is not exactly like the early Megadeth speed/thrash metal, but its very good solid heavy metal and the lyrics are really good and very intense. I suggest instead of comparing it to the older albums just take it for what it is, a great metal album. Kingmaker, Burn, Dance in the Rain, Beginning of Sorrow and Cold Sweat just rock, really every song hear does.  This is the best metal album out so far this year.
B000002GJH|5.0|I really cannot say enough good things about this album. If you are a Chris Cornell fan than you probally already own this album, if not you are in for a real treat. Alot of people do not know about this Album because it was the only one put out by this band, which was formed by Chris Cornell in memory of Andrew Wood, the lead singer of Mother Love Bone who died of a heroin overdose. This album took 2 years to reach the charts, and only did so after Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam got their fame. Chris Cornell got Eddie Vedder to share a small role in the album on the third track of the CD called Hunger Strike. If you love early 90's rock than you MUST own this CD
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A truly energizing read, packed with plenty of action and mystery.  One of the best books I have read all year.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I think that this game is great and I believe that all Iron Man fans should get this amazing game.
0440246318|4.0|Classic Jack Reacher book though a bit drawn out and loose at the end. What was very interesting was how often Lee Child described Jack Reacher, mentioned his height and physical presence ... how often pointed out his intimidating physical size ... almost like he was telling us he knew what his hero looked like and was not responsible for movie casting!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It was  a awesome game I hope there is a part 2 I enjoy this game very much. Thank you for making this game keep it up.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Allman hits all the right notes with this superb blues album.  The voice and instrumental work are fine renditions of the blues.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|When I read this dictionary I was reading some tough words. But I did learn some new ones and what they ment this was a very good book. Thanks! I give you a 5/5! I give you this rating because it teaches me new words.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I'm sorry my memory isn't being kind today. I do remember enjoying this book but the details are what I can't remember.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci does not bog you down in alot of technical jargon like Clancy did, not that this novel is anything like what Clancy wrote.  In Clancy's Novels, I would find myself skimming whole pages of needlessly detailed technical info that did not do anything to advance the story but instead detracted from it.<br /><br />I am hoping that Baldacci slows down a bit before he gets like Patterson, with 3 and 4 novels on the shelf at a time,  Readers aren't stupid.  We know when the main author has stopped writing and the ghost writer steps in.<br /><br />I have enjoyed his writing and after reading the Innocent, purchased &#34;theHit&#34; right away based on my enjoyment of The Innocent.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|This is a movie you need to watch multiple times to understand exactly what is going on. I see things I didn't catch the first or second time.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Following the most recent reading, in February 2013, of the final Navy SEAL book I would ever purchase (about eight in all), some of which were fabulous reads (Lone Survivor, The Warrior Elite: The Forging of SEAL Class 228), and some terrible (SEAL Team 6), I swore to myself that I'd never purchase another SEAL book. Most of them are structured along the same tiring format, BUD/S, advanced training, additional training and then a couple stories in their careers. This is not to diminish my love and respect for any man able to endure and become a SEAL. I hold them in the utmost respect and am deeply greatful for their inner strength, endurance and determination to be the best in the world. I recently read a review of Fearless, the story of SEAL Adam Brown. WOW. am I  pleased with the decision to try one more. This book was very different. It;s about Adam Brown the boy, Adam Brown the teen, Adam Brown the athlete, the addict, the recovery... Adam Brown the husband, father, patriot and written into his story was Adam Brown the SEAL. Buy it... Read it... and you'll identify and be inspired by him. Superbly written by a caring and excellent author, Eric Blehm, it's all a book can be. Get It..Read it... You'll be pleased you did.
1400052181|4.0|Cellular physiology is not an especially exciting subject to the average man, but the superb writing skills of Rebecca Skloot bring the questions of ethics and law to life. Her depiction of the Lacks family is honest and candid. She does not romanticize the ignorance nor demean the people. Likewise, she characterizes the scientists fairly, acknowledging their achievements but also showing their insensitivity. A very interesting and informative work. And a timely one, given the most recent U.S. Supreme Court decision on patent protection for genetic material.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|I found the premise of being shocked! shocked! to learn that lies we're propagated to cover a failed covert operation a bit weak, unfocused, ho-hum in the context of some of the actual sordidness that we can daily read about in the news. I stayed to the end, hoping against hope that something a bit stronger would happen, and because Le Carré has never lost his stylistic touch, but, in the end, I left disappointed.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This was a book club selection and I really didn't know what to expect. I certainly did not anticipate a romp around the world following the historic events of the 20th century and meeting the characters that drove them. The dry humor, even if a little dark at times, was enchanting. I recommend this work as a fun read for light entertainment.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|It's okay.  Don't know exactly know what I expected but it's just not that great.  It seems kind of jumbled up and not well organized.
B0093BUVPG|5.0|I bought the vinyl copy, and it's wonderful 180g pressings with plastic sleeves, definitely a surprise for the price. Great vocals and beats throughout this album.  I heard it first on NPR (you can search to find a streaming link) and had to buy it the next day.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Hated it. Deleted it!  Don't want it! Don't like the concept of being tied to someone else! What was I thinking!
B00C061I3K|5.0|It's not as club friendly as previous works by daft punk, but it flows nicely between many genres and styles and I have enjoyed this album thoroughly.
B00004ZBVG|5.0|one of t  he best dvd's that i have to date. i will be looking for more like it very soon
B003YL4LYI|1.0|After waiting months for this last volume I was completely disappointed.  Suddenly a multitude of new characters and no conclusion as to where the characters from the first 4 volumes are.  Everything left hanging.  Waste of time and money
B00CW665VI|5.0|I looked like an idiot laughing my ass off reading this book at work but so worth it! I can't wait to read her next book. I loved reading this book from a males point of view. You are now one of my new favorite authors.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Makes me wonder how Lisa Gardner comes up with all of these twisted plots and dark characters...<br /><br />Why I liked the book?  Plot, characters and well-researched facts.  Why you should buy or read the book?  It is very well-written and paced just right.  It is actually cheaper than watching the latest movie, and a lot more gratifying.<br /><br />Recommendation:  Buy it or borrow a copy from your local library.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this  game! The best thing about this game is that you don't have to have energy just to do something. If you like/love animals this is the game for you
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Beautiful graphics! Enjoyable for every one who doesn't own a horse but wants one. Perfect for horse lovers. Very fun!
0143116738|2.0|I have to agree with another reviewer who gave the book two stars and went on to describe how the book talks a lot about celebrities who found and pursued their, \\"Element\\". Or about someone who started out as a doctor and ended up being a writer. Lots of examples of: started out doing \\"this\\" and ended up becoming the well know \\"that\\". It is not a bad book but I wanted more than what it offered.  There are far too many examples about celebrities and their road to the top.  There are some great little gems in the book but those could be summed up on a page or two. Unfortunately you have to read through the whole book to find them inter-dispersed. I am a great fan of Ken Robinson but this book falls short. I guess it is good for someone who needs a pep talk to get them on there way but not a lot meat. Most of the book is obvious. It is a guide on how to make lemonade out of lemons, how to find and follow your passion, the secret to happiness etc etc.. I recommend that one borrows this from the library as it's not a keeper.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really entertaining story! Youre going to love it. i personally couldn't wait until the nighttime to read it again. Well written. So glad I ordered it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Clever, dramatic, intelligent, comical and exciting. Can enjoy re-watching any and all episodes. Highly recommend to anyone that enjoys a great story , lovely period clothing,and an idyllic setting.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I wish there wer more series like this one.  The story and acting, music are great. The singing is really wonderful.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have been waiting for this book for awhile and was eager to see how this story ends. But no. I am left still asking questions about the characters. This is frustrating. I enjoyed this story and the storyline keeps your interest going, but the book goes into too many different directions. I wished that  Eva and Gideon`s story could have come to one  happy conclusion. I feel unsettled.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This one keeps my brain working.  It is enjoyabe and addictive to me.  I have recommended to all my friends.  I am trying to beat my former score every time I play it.  I recommend it to everybody.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|i loved this app but then it started freezing and i tried to get into the app again and it wouldnt let me. it just went back to my carosel. i took it off but it wont let me get it back!!!!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Pros:<br />Nice shape, extremely comfortable with a great button layout.<br />Very sensitive.<br />Easy to use software.<br />Can adjust weight of mouse.<br />Can adjust the dpi on the fly.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Only 2 profiles in the software.<br />Adding/ removing weights clumsy due to holes the add ins could easy fall down into the mouse body if you accidentally dropped them.<br />Software only supports 2 profiles.<br />Adjusting &#34;color&#34; of the mouse only adjusts the Anker logo, none of the other lights.<br />Mine came with the cord cover slightly frayed at the end, fixed with scissors, QC should have caught that before it hit the box.<br /><br />Really, I'm having a very positive experience with the mouse even if I sound like I'm being critical.  Amazing deal at the $40 US I paid for it.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I was surprised on how good this movie was, especially for a Tom Cruise movie. I also want to mention its super LAME there is a minimum word requirement for a review: not really wanting to write page long reviews for every little purchase I make on this website.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|The program was excellent - however my internet speeds for upload and download are 40 - 50 mbps and had a problem with your HD. Netflicks and Vodo never a problem............
B00985E3UG|5.0|great. well written  read if you dare to eat again.  Amazing what big food businessis up to. Makes me mad and  I know they don't give a dam.
B002YVAT72|3.0|PROS: 1) Good-looking turntable; 2) The software that comes with it is very easy to use.<br /><br />CONS: 1)  Please be aware that this turntable does NOT have a button/switch that moves the needle arm to the record. (There is a lever to move the needle arm up and down, but you must manually move the needle over to the record). For me, this is primarily a problem when transferring (&#34;recording&#34;) LPs to my PC, as you might hear a &#34;clunk&#34; when you lower the turntable cover and this &#34;clunk&#34; will be picked up in the recording.<br /><br />2) Fairly often, and rather inexplicably, when in the &#34;recording&#34; mode (LP to PC), all you hear is a large hissing sound---total distortion. Sometimes this hissing sound goes on for several minutes, sometimes for just as few seconds. I didn't notice some of the instances of the hissing until after I burned and played the CD copy of the LP.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works better then the usb came with my kindle fire 8.9 HD and charge faster best one I got
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|Time was not the Rod Stewart of the past.  I guess he must be in love with his wife. Most of the songs seem to be for her. To sentimental, but Okay.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|To my immense surprise this movie is a good one. funny, loving and partly at least well acted (ms Lopes is great, Ms Diaz ..not so much) I hate that all the  ladies are hot and the guys tend to be lukewarm at best and it IS fairly (and unnecessarily) *colorless*. and it brushes over the real possiblity of maternal mortality (like almost all american movies on that front) but since it is intended to be light, that is ok. I was surprised by how nice it was overall
B00COGXX7A|4.0|Enjoyable.  Book is better...Very touching story!  I would recommend this movie, but say you should read the book before seeing it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is awesome. You can even build famous buildings.It`s entertaining for all ages. My son,daughter liked it. You should get it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book does not need another 5 star review but to be fair to the writing community I just have to.  Sometimes you feel you have to write reviews because a book is really, really bad.  This time I felt I had to write a review because the book was so good.  I LOVED the characters, all of them.  The dialogue was hilarious and best of all, the h was a strong character.  I'm sorry to say that it is extremely hard to find all of these things in books and Tangled had them all.  I can't wait to read more from this author!
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|This album is great! I would suggest it to all Shinedown fans! Definitely worth it. Another great one from a rocking band!
1451627297|5.0|When you think about Stephen King you may think that since the fact that he's cosidered the King of horror, the only thnig that he can write is horror. You're wrong! This a time travel story but it catches your attention since the first page just like the Others King's books. It's a page turner book you won't put it down.<br />King Rules!
0062225715|4.0|Not the best one, but definitely way better than a fair amount of books from anyone else than Pratchett. In short, decent amongst the Discworld series, very good over all nowadays' novels.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game has made me think of the old Mario bros. Can't wait till candy crush saga come to amazon.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is a fun packed game. You collect money and buy characters and upgrades. I give it five stars.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Its great for kindle fire and amazing to use it helps u keep in touch with old friends or family
B009HUB40Y|2.0|A rather boring game all-in-all.  Plus the flickering and pulsing jewels were annoying.  Played it for about 5 minutes then promptly uninstalled it.  If I need something for appt waits etc. I'll stick with solitaire.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I love this game it is awesome I get in trouble for playing to much. it takes to long to load that is the only problem
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Reading this book makes me incredibly proud to be an American and to know what true heroism looks like. Excellent book that embodies the best America has to offer on the battlefield.
B0094K1K42|4.0|It was a well done some what non-fiction of what happens to the these past high school popular girls that seem to think they can keep living in the past; and find it difficult to accept real life.  At times you felt sorry for the main character but most of the time you were just &#34;whatever&#34;, should have been a better person.  Charlize Theron was excellent, and pushed my review with an extra star.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Great game, keeps you thinking the whole time. You just don't want to stop so see what's next. Beautiful scenery!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It's fun its not my favorite game to play but its fun from time to time. This game is the kind of game were you try to beat your score kinda like temple run 2 were you try to get new characters.  Its fun.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Whether you are a parent, educator, or American, this book will challenge your belief systems related to success, and it will poke holes in the great American myth of our heros pulling themselves up by their bootstraps in times of adversity to overcome all odds by themselves.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Another fascinating book by Halled Hosseini. I give it 4 stars only because I can't like it more than The kite Rinner
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|This show is very entertaining. I would not watch it with small children around though. I read the books and especially like how accurate it has been. My only criticism is the deviation from the books, but I can understand the constraints there must be for filming.  I truly enjoyed tyrion and arya. These are my favorite characters.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Good story I don't know why they altered the movie story so much from the true story but still cried like a baby.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Just did not enjoy the story line as well as his first two books and the characters were somewhat hard to follow.  However, it did give a story of life in Aphaganhistan if extremely poor vs extremely rich in the mid 1900's to current days.  Makes one have sympathy for these people and the poor in these types of countries.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|One of the better books I've read so far this year. I will look forward  to reading  Kaled Hosseini's next work.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Enjoyed this book and the first person approach of author.  I prefer reading the books first if a movie has been made about them.  The movie followed fairly closely; some discrepancy,
0307730700|5.0|It is said that a hero is an ordinary person who does extraordinary things. Well said, and mostly true. But I think it is possible that some people are just born...extraordinary. And when they go on to use that for good, they are heroes too. Adam Brown was such a man, and his story, Fearless: the Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown,  flawlessly told by Eric Blehm, is breathtaking.<br /><br />Adam was born to a simple family in Arkansas, but it became quickly apparent he was not simple. A daredevil's daredevil, he raced, jumped, and crashed through his childhood at breakneck speed. All well and good until he graduated high school and that daredevil personality was hooked by the ruthless allure of dangerous drugs. His life spiraled downward until one day, he gave it to Jesus. From that point forward, Romans 8:28 began to find proving ground in Adam: \\"For we know all things work together for good to those who love God and are called according to His purpose.\\"<br /><br />Marrying the love of his life and beginning a family, Adam began to pursue a military career that would take him to the absolute top handful of soldiers in the world--SEAL Team 6. Battling the drug demons that surfaced from time to time trying to reclaim a lost customer, he nevertheless pushed on and ruthlessly pursued perfection in every aspect of his military career. And through it all his passionate love for his God, his wife and his children was an irresolute background.<br /><br />Killed in action in Afghanistan, Adam died a hero...but he had lived a hero's life for many years already.<br /><br />This book had me riveted. Eric Blehm's writing style is so personable that I feel like I knew Adam a little bit, and that I know his family. I definitely put down the book feeling changed; it makes me want to live life for my kids as heroically in my own ordinary sphere of influence as Adam did in his extraordinary realm. Although I received a copy of this book for free from Multnomah WaterBrook for review purposes, I would have read this book anyway.<br /><br />For more information on the book and the author, go here and if you would like to read the first chapter, go here.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Well done just like the Tudors. However it's not historically accurate its very well written and produced. Jeremy irons and all other actors are great!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  I think this is one of the most entertaining books I've read.  Pick this book up!
B0071MDA2U|5.0|This is Great dystopian fiction written by a great author. I loved this series. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
0061730335|4.0|good book with a great story. We could all learn alot by doing what this young man did in our own lives.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Garth Stein wrote this book from the perspective of the dog's obversations of the people in his world, and it is both touching, funny, and enraging.  I couldn't put it down and loved the ending.  I bought the book for my son.  It's one of the few books (I think) that isn't a dude or chick only book.  When I was in the Frankfurt airport I saw a guy in he Army reading it and ended up having one of the best conversations with him about books and life-philosophy, which is a bit about what The Art Of Racing In The Rain touches on.  Buy this book and sit down for a great read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Loved this show, I am hooked on it and cant wait for the next season! Love the witty humor and would definitely recommend this.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I had to watch this movie for a class I was taking an had not heard of it before so I watched it on instant video. Turned out to be a really good movie, just dont walk away without hitting pause. There is too much going on and missing one part can be very confusing. It does jump around a lot through the different time periods, but it's interesting to see how it all comes together.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game on my kindle.  It is AWESOME!!!  I have been playing almost every day for the past 6 months.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|He murked this s***. He did such a beautiful job on this album that I'm proud of him! He has really evolved from his Bastard days and is doing it right. Woooo~
B00AKFG15S|2.0|The first 2 books were a good read but this one onky<br />the first half was ok,<br />for the rest it seems that he did not know how to end the book<br />and many things seened really unreasonable.<br />I am sure he could make a much better job of it. My wife also<br />read it and also she was very disapointed and would give it one star only.
B007HJ9LXE|2.0|I thought it was well acted but the tempo was slow and a bit boring for me.  Selma Hayek is great as Frieda.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very funny.  I wouldn't show it to my 5 year old - not ready for him to pick up on that humor, yet.  But very funny.  I look forward to number 2.
B00008RV1L|2.0|I did not care for this movie. I realize that it was a comment on the excess of the 80s but found this to be underdeveloped and could have been shorter. I really got very little out of watching this and would not consider watching it again. Waste of time IMO.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I think this game is fun, because you have to build your base and defend it. This game<br />Also has good graphics
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Lots of fun. You won't be disappointed. History channel did a good job with this one and it is a hit.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|it is so much fun to play by completing missions and getting new pets to take care of.I LOVE LITTLEST PET SHOP
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Typical Baldacci.  Hard to put down.  How does he keep coming up with new ideas??  Intrigue and fun are his specialty.
0062101897|5.0|its awesome! i love harry potter and the book i got is brand new for a lower price, its perfect thank you.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Great, educational, makes the kids think! a Good Thing these days. Grandson loves it, and I think it's better than a violent video game.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I installed this app for the express purpose of downloading android games/apps to my phone.  (The Google play won't download larger games to my Samsung phone.) I purchased several games.  They never got sent to my phone.  I never received any notifications of failure.  Following the instructions doesn't work either, as there is no place in the app's menu structure to go to \\"my apps\\".  Consequently, I can't re-send the games to my phone and the whole thing is a colossal waste of money and time, especially time.<br /><br />I'm not such a shopaholic freak that I can't wait to get home to my PC before buying something.  I've got a certain amount of impulse control...
B006LSZECO|1.0|I downloaded this book one night because EVERYONE was talking about it and EVERYONE was recommending it. I was rolling my eyes by the end of the first chapter. The characters are unlikable, the prose is weak, and anyone who'd ever taken an introduction to creative writing course saw the Mack truck sized holes in the plot. I think this book is one of those that people only talk about because it has a big (totally predictable) plot twist and it makes people who've read it feel &#34;in the know&#34; over people who haven't. I wish I had my $12 and three hours back...
B00821OX98|3.0|Post apocalyptic series, survivors struggle with invading aliens and local bandits...  a bit formulaic, but keeps your attention.  Character development weak
B001ANSSDC|3.0|When I start hearing a lot of popular buzz about a book, like this one or Gone Girl, I try to make an effort to read them and I'm always sorry. I just didn't get it. While there was nothing wrong with this book specifically, I didn't think it was great. In the end I was uncomfortable with the way the author approached the subject of mental illness. I felt like, from time to time, rather than being fully capable adults with struggles, the characters came across as mentally handicapped. It frequently left me shaking my head. It's an interesting story, but the plot is predictable and the presentation is nothing profound. It's strictly okay.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|I hadn't bought a Willie Nelson CD in years, last time was a vinyl LP, I think.  I wanted this one for the first song on the playlist but ended up loving the whole thing.  It's Willie-style, what else, and it's just a truly lovely take on some wonderful old tunes. They are precious and beloved tunes. Spouse and I sang along as we danced and spoke of being grateful for the old songs that people know and sing to and love.  We thought the same thing this week as the wonderful Stephen Colbert had as his guest the wonderful Paul McCartney and what did they sing (beautifully) together?  \\"Cheek to Cheek\\", the beloved old standard from probably the 1930s that Fred Astaire sang and danced to.  McCartney and Colbert - and spouse and I - all knew the words and sang them and it's a joyous thing to do that. Who knows or sings - or cares about - the stuff that is pumped out today?  What an amazing songster Willie is and we're so glad he keeps on singin' the songs, his own and others.
1439192812|5.0|This book if for people that want to understand our world through the nature, with a beautiful designs that explain much more than a words.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I actually enjoyed DEAD EVER AFTER more than I expected to; in fact, I enjoyed it enough to order the follow-up epilogue due out in a few months. I thought Ms. Harris was correct in deciding it was time the story come full circle. Besides, there can't be any more supernatural creatures out there who haven't yet shown up in Bon Temps, short of Darby O'Gill and his Little People. No spoilers here, but I liked the ending and thought it was appropriate. A good ending to a very creative and delightful series!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|My phone does not tell me exactly how much of my battery is left, so having an app that does is extremely useful.
B009RH9FR6|3.0|I like this case, but it could be better. If you happen to lift it from top panel, the hold thing opens up like a trifold wallet, with your kindle swings in the air.  It needs some thing to hold it together .  It's okay.
0553814826|5.0|This book is truly very intelligently written and insightful.  I loved it because it helped me to come to terms with the very horrible parents that I had.  Many times even though one wants to become independent from a dysfunctional family and becomes prey to it again.  This book helps overcome the traps our toxic parents set for us to be unhappy, unsuccessful, and unloved.  It helps and shows ways to overcome the unhealthy relationship with parents which can help you take control and overcome the negativity.  It also helps with letting go of the toxic influence of parents.  This is a book which any good therapist and client should read because I learned more from it than all my years of therapy.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|There is good reason why this show is so popular. We've enjoyed following these characters as they live out the years depicted in the series. Can't wait to see where season three takes us!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|wouldnt recommend to others although its pretty fun but he flips over and i dont like that but try it and see its free
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|I love this movie, never saw it till recent and the fact that when i got ready to order it i got it in 2 days & it was cheaper than at movie store.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Book went really quick, and I really enjoyed the way Card kept you guessing as to what would come next.  I'll continue reading the series.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|very colorful and interesting movie!<br />the only thing I didn't like is the whole good witch/bad witch thing....so stereotypical for nowadays...
B009EAO38C|5.0|I love this calming music. I have it on my kindle & listen while I read! Good special deal, too!
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|It was ok pretty much what you would think. Girl married bad guy. Girl leaves bad guy. Bag guy goes crazy losing Girl. Girl moves to a new town falls in love with a beautiful man. Beautiful man saves Girl from Bad Guy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's fun and not to hard to figure out. I'm stuck on a floor right now, should be able to get out soon.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Very moving. Just so hard to even imagine. Happy ending but very hard to believe they all lived. Bring tissues.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I just wish it didn't end. I would have liked to see Arthur find out Merlin had magic and then see them together bring peace after defeating Morgana.<br />Thank you for providing me with the entire series of Merlin. I literally watch it every night to get my fix.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I thought this was going to be alot like Knocked Up. At least fun way. Not at all funny, more stupid funny. Plus too many bad words. That didbn't even belong. Came off strange.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|The movie was good. I like the message of choices  between good and bad. It paints a picture of people making sacrifices
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I just love Tom Hanks usually love his movies. But this was not for me. Didnt like it. Just not for me. Completely different then what I thought or expected.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Side effects is a great drama. it leaves you in suspense. The actors are wonderful. It kept me interested throughout the movie
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Fell asleep several times. Usually love the actors in this movie so I was super excited but was extremely disappointed. Just slow and dull.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This calculator is perfect for any quick math needs! I have absolutely no complaints about it! If you need a calculator definitely get this one, it's worth it. However, I got it when it was on the free day so I couldn't tell you it's worth paying for.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My mom told me about this app and I use it daily. I love it! Great buy and I would recommend it to anyone who loves nature sounds.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|The tiles are not as challenging as I would like them. It is a however good enough to pass time and keep the brain sharp. I do enjoy it when I have idle time on my hands.
B00BUT5IAC|5.0|After giving this new album about 3-4 full spins, I find that it grows on you more each consecutive time. While the lead off singles, &#34;Hollow&#34; and &#34;Stone&#34; may not seem like the instant hits like &#34;Check My Brain&#34; and &#34;Your Decision&#34; from the previous album, they stand as a testament to Alice In Chains' perfection of the sludge/grunge sound they created 20 years ago. Jerry Cantrell has always leaned heavily on the dismal side of life and his songwritng on this album is pure depression all the way through. Perhaps the sarcasism of the title track might be seen as a glimmer of humor with lines like, &#34;The devil put dinosaurs here, Jesus doesn't like a queer&#34;. Nevertheless this is an album that will turn your sunniest days to grey no doubt. The artwork on the picture disc vinyl version, (which is the version I purchased through Amazon) is creative and grim, adding to the overall theme of the album.
B007SGM084|4.0|The book is very captivating and enjoyable to read. I find myself so intrigued with it that time passes fast for me.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I loved this movie from its brilliant start to startling climax and amazing conclusion. Never before has such a fantastic character seemed so... plausible. The extended opening sequence on Krypton lends a solid foundation to this highly character driven story. The first big screen adaptation of the most iconic superhero of all time claimed \\"You'll believe a man can fly.\\" In this stunning piece of artistry and masterful storytelling (with plentiful explosions :) laced throughout) you will believe once again. His power of flight, heat vision, physical strength, and speed are all seamlessly a part of who he is. Yet for all of his \\"powers\\" his greatest strength is his very human spirit, and this marvelous strength is shared by those he strives to protect.<br /><br />As a comic book fan I found this adaptation richly satisfying. Nearly every element that I was looking for was present, but with a twist that made the story more coherent. And many highly implausible things from the comics and previous movies/TV shows that always made me roll my eyes with a \\"yeah, right\\" were not shied away from but rather redressed in a way that made me respond, \\"ah, that makes more sense.\\"  We've been waiting for this Superman to show up for a long time. Well done guys, well done.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I use it all the time. I think it does a pretty good job. You have to easse into it and figure it out a little
B003VANOFY|5.0|For the price, I feel the Logitech G930 is worth every penny!<br /><br />Basically, if you're looking for quality of sound and decent battery life, get this!
B00C7JG0KG|2.0|Let me get this much straight: I absolutely looove blu-ray 3D films and am totally for getting as much of it as my wallet affords.<br /><br />Here's what I just don't get (and the reason for 2 stars--\\"I don't like it\\"--on this PRODUCT, as well as the reason for not purchasing): I'm an amazon customer living in Mexico who just hates what Disney does over here, which is to sell a bare-bones 1-disc 3D version of a movie (rarely it'll also include the digital copy disc) for a waaayyy much more expensive price than a 2D blu-ray + DVD + digital copy bundle! PLUS, being Disney, it's usually more expensive than other studio blu-rays and prices hardly ever drop--even after years of release dates! As an example, \\"Oz El Poderoso 3D\\" (Spanish title) is available on a popular Mexican site in a 1-disc Blu-ray 3D presentation (and NO digital copy stated in the picture) for a \\"pre-sale\\" bargain (LOL!) price of 445 pesos (Mexican currency)--roughly 34 or 35 US bucks--, while the 2-disc 2D blu-ray + DVD (again, NO digital copy seemingly included) \\"bundle\\" is (also \\"low pre-sale\\" price) 326 pesos--about US$25 or US$26. There's no other way to get the complete set (3D+2D+DVD+or-DC) than buying both of these separately MEANING 771 PESOS OR 60 DOLLARS!!! NO WAY, JOSE!!! What can a man like me--faaar from wealthy, sorry to admit!--do but order from amazon and pay international shipping (and wait longer than US residents etc) simply because A) the bundles are (better said, \\"were\\") complete, and B) oftentimes cheaper than their Mexican counterparts even with shipping. I'd bet it's happening in many other parts of the world, as well! JEEEE-ZUS! On a side note, I just looked at Alice In Wonderland 3D single-disc Mexican version and it's 495 pesos--that's 39 US!!! What a joke!<br /><br />So, it all boils down to Disney spreading the greed disease to the US. My having written this is with the intention that, now that you American residents can feel what many others around the globe (or at leastsome miles south) are suffering from, you will then add your voices to make this expensive-single-3D-disc trend change for the better. Heck, by now one would think 3D was a given addition to ANY blu-ray package just in case people wanted it, AND CHEAPLY IF NOT FREELY!<br /><br />Had to get that off my chest. Hope people react--especially you, Disney suits! 3D is now becoming very well crafted and there should be no reason for marketing to end up killing the format, as more and more customers will in the end be forced to turn away from it... WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE!
B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan and Charlotte sound terrific together on this CD.  Jonathan's voice does sound a bit different from his live performances, but it still sound great.  The whole family enjoys listening to it.  Every time I listen to it my favorite track changes -- there's not a bad song on the CD.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I truly had to question if the same author really wrote this one. It was extremely cheesy especially the ending. Really reminded me of an old Scooby Doo plot.
B004X30XPC|5.0|I have just played my CD to death - the combination of Ella and Joe is beyond belief!<br />Listening to them on Henry Mancini's Oscar winning \\"Days of Wine and Roses\\" makes me<br />cry every time.  It's just so beautiful.  There are some GREAT songs on this CD, some<br />popular, some you didn't hear Ella sing quite as often.  Each song is a gem, and the<br />synergy between Ella and Joe was made in heaven.<br />Highly recommended for all fans of jazz and the great American Songbook.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I updated my game and when ever I tap on the new levels it freezes and closes my game fix the game and then I will give it a better review
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|man cant till I get the full edition and man I love the music and the theme of the clock also, I like the alarm clock because it reminds me of my android phone. XD
B001DUDKEY|5.0|One of the best movies ever. I have seen every adaption of this movie and this is my favorite. You really come to care for these characters.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Product was easy to mount and came with a protector to prevent scratching of the handle bar to which it mounts.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|My title says it all, but to add to it I'll say it's useful most of all....that's all I have to say.
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|I toiled between this mount and the one larger. This was the perfect length for my bike. Puts the mounted object in a natural reaching distance
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It's as if you have the computer game in your own convenience, now you are able to take your gaming wherever you go<br />(DOWNSIDE)<br />  If you have already created a online ninjakiwi account, with this mobile purchase you must start all over, but take it for this, are you up for the challenge!!!!!!!! :D
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed how this story unfolded, it was gentle, but inviting. I found the narrative about the children in care slightly  disturbing. I particularly  enjoyed the ending.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is a game where you make a dragon zoo and get rare dragons by breeding.it's addictive and I played it so long I have a gemstone island!it's very fun and addictive.I suggest this to all dragon lovers.
0756407915|5.0|Yes, Rothfuss is dragging with the storyline.  Yes, you don't know much more about our friends the Chandrian at the end of this book.  I'm still enjoying the read enough to be very eager for the next installment.  I actually ran into a relative at a party that also read the first two and he's very excited about the third book as well.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is a great app. Always tells me how much battery left and how long it needs to charge. Recommended
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Ugh...  My son has wanted this game for a long time so I finally downloaded it.  Let me just say that I'll not look back on the fifteen minutes I spent on this game fondly.  I'll remember it like a particularly boring church sermon from my childhood.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't pur this book down. It was very interesting. The writing was very imaginative. I did not know what to expect  next.  Every trial encountered by the Tributes was unexpected.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|I got this movie from Netflix. I usually don't watch movies with subtitles but this movie is sooooooooooo worth it. I watched it alone twice, then called my best friend and we watched it together and she loved it as much as I did.  I called my son and he came over and watched it with me and he loved it.  I'm buying this movie because I know that I will watch it over and over.  The relationship between these two men, one a paraplegic, the other, a black man, poor, living in the projects and unemployed after doing time in prison for robbery. I would've loved this movie even if it was fiction but the fact that it's a true story blew me away.  It's part fall down laughing funny and bring tears to your eyes poignant.  If you could only watch one movie for the rest of your life, watch this one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Another imaginative read. It was full of lots of adventure and heart stopping drama. Loved the ending.<br />We need another Trilogy of books!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|jet pack joyride provides  a lot of information on the joys eof flying along with easy amanieverability and i really enjoyed playing ..easy for many agese
B00992CF6W|4.0|A portable version of minecraft! I can't complain to much but there is one thing, I found red stone mined it got nothing. This needs an update. If your looking for a story driven game this is NOT for you. This a sand box game.<br /><br />8/10 Jesse~
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Graphics are great and the gameplay is amazing. The tutorial is extremely helpful and pretty much everything else works great<br />. Just great
1594745692|5.0|I won't comment on how accurate or inaccurate a reading from this deck is, but the artwork is beautiful! If you are a zombie fan, this tarot deck should be in your collection.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I had chosen this game to play on my emulator on my desktop. My desktop is not a touchscreen, and therefore I could only play this with the mouse, like playing with 1 finger.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I didn't know what to think about it at first. there seemed to be a lot of people who liked it, and I heard it was fun, so I decided to try it out.<br /><br />It is addicting. It really is. The object of the game is to build things out of blocky materials like dirt, sand, stone, gold, etc. If you play in survival mode, you have to basically survive against zombies, spiders, and creepers that try to attack you. This mode is very fun and is probably my favorite. the other is creative mode, where you have unlimited resources and no monsters to create anything your blocky heart desires. this mode is good for passing time and getting creative juices flowing.<br /><br />the update has this thing called realms, which is my only problem. even after I created an account to play this collaborative feature, it claims that no slots are avalible. I check back all the time and cannot get it to open slots. I don't really know what's going on, but that's my only complaint.<br /><br />yep... that's it...
B003XQG0JI|2.0|I absolutely love the Corrs.  I was hoping this would somewhat satisfy my desire for more Corrs-like music.  I really enjoy the Corrs' instrumentals, as much and maybe more than their other pieces.  I really like Andrea's voice and thought Sharon sounded good as a back-up singer.  Sharon is a great violinist, but cannot carry an album as a lead singer.  I didn't enjoy her singing at all.  She should have done more instrumentals.  Maybe their brother Jim is the main one to thank for all that great music!  These songs don't quite measure up.  I was disappointed.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I love this CD,  I could not believe my ears when I heard this Cd for the first time;  since then I have not been able to STOP!<br />this Cd will take you into a trip, has a lots of 70's and 80's on it and I love it! the rhythms could not be better position on the whole album the arrangements and the collaborations are perfect .<br />This album was a very nice surprise!
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Anything like this is a tale. However, the boy and the community accepting him as a lawyer in a small town are creating a warm atomosphere.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My favorite feature of this version is that it turns with the screen and can be switched to and from right handed. This makes the game enjoyable no matter what position I'm in.  No issues, Ben using it for months.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I buy these for use in my child's talking books.  They are the same as what I find in the local stores, but cost only 20-30% of what I usually pay
0525425772|5.0|Another great book in the life of Theo Boone. I have read all the books John Grisham has written. When I found this series, I thought my son might enjoy them. I was right but I read the books with my son. Great summer read for anyone!
B00BX2QTWC|5.0|I really just love Woodkid. I've never heard music like his before.<br /><br />This debut album is simply amazing, a great experience.
0743243153|5.0|His Book \\"The Road Less Traveled\\" Was A life Raft To Me. I Read It In The Early 80'S. I Also Was Fortunate Enough To Meet Him And Attend some Of His Talks...My Pastor/Mentor Was A Friend Of His..I Don't Think He Lost His Way At All.He New Exactly What He Was About And He wasn't Afraid To Share ...He Just Didn't Follow The Pack and Was One Of A Kind....A TREASURE.....
B006LSZECO|5.0|Spell bounding, keeps you reading, want to turn the page and don't put down until fished! Finished in 2 days.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin paints a vivid picture of LINCOLN. How fortunate we were to have had Lincoln as president when we did. We see a truly self-made man who did not let his ego get in the way of the needs of the country. We see Lincoln grow in stature as he faces the great crisis of the civil war. I recall a motivational statement: &#34;There are no great men, only great challenges ordinary men are forced by circumstances to meet.&#34; Lincoln was seemingly the most ordinary of men, who became GREAT by meeting a great challenge. DKG does an outstanding job of showing the reader the process of this outstanding personal achievement.
B005HSL626|4.0|All you have to do is slice the fruit.  sounds easy but then the bombs sneak in with the fruit and sometimes more boms than fruit.  It keep the kids entertained.  I'm a little slow.
B00985E3UG|5.0|If you think you can trust the food industry to provide you with healthy food guess again. As long as consumers are willing to buy and eat it (and food producers will make sure you are), they will produce it,  regardless of what effect it may have on your health.  Michael Moss describes an industry without a conscience and what happens to those within the industry who do have one.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|My grandson plays it and likes it. I tried and its not as good as a real pinball game. I am just old school.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is one of my favorite games to play and this version is very user friendly and fun to play.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|This figure is absolutely amazing. It's detail put in to this action figure is top notch. I would definitely recommend purchasing one whether you're an adult collector or as a gift for a kid. It's a must have.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really good game if you like escape game you will love this. All good fun. But I would say that as I love escape game.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I downloaded it and it started working greatly. Im so happy to have this app. I have the same app on my phone and I wanted it on my kindle as well.
B009RH9FR6|3.0|I wanted a cover that would double as a stand.  This one does that with no problem.  I particularly like the elastic band that allows me to hold it without cramping my fingers.<br /><br />The rating would be much higher if the thing didn't weigh so much.  It definately rivals holding a hard back book.  Also, the elastic I love to use has started to weaken at the connecting corners.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Being that it wasnt able to download fto my kindle for some reason, we cant play it to try it out.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|The use of the N-word was used like the F-word in the Sopranos. No social value to it if the point was to advance race relations. A dark comedy and no pun intended.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|i always enjoy quentin's stuff.....no lack of gore here! LOL<br />The good dentist was outstanding and very clever in his dialogue which I found to be very entertaining
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|There are no big surprises in this move but it is an enjoyable period piece with wonderful characters and witty dialog.  Classic Jane Austin.
1416914307|5.0|we did receive this product and are very happy to have it. It is a good read. Thank you very much.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Very good show, I would recommend it one hundred percent ! I am glad to see there is a second season.
B006TTC5JK|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie. Rainy Saturday afternoons watching it on a snowy TV as a kid to the new digitized captioned copy as an adult.<br />The story line could fit in anywhere. It is a story about someone who likes the skin they are in even if everyone else thinks they are a bit touched. Sometimes silly, sometimes profound. And you can hear the dialog over the music.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Streaming you tube on the tablet is very slow and pauses a lot.  You have to be in an optimum area to get a decent viewing.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It's is great to play and has lots of action. I really recommend it to all of you gamer peoples!
1781162646|5.0|Only complaint is I wish it was longer. Great story (especially for a summer read). Steven King is still the best.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show. Glad I stumbled upon it on my Kindle Fire. If you are looking for &#34;Legal Laughs&#34; try this.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|A stylish psychological thriller with an amazing cast.  The characters are so complex and fascinating... I can't stop watching it!
B004G600A4|5.0|Great Packing, Good Shipping time. All as expected.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Fantastic story will be re-reading for sure! Cant wait to see the movie, I'm sure it will be awesome. Recommend entire series to anyone interested.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Great Packing, Good Shipping time. All as expected.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Awesome book. Couldnt put it down. This is the second time I am reading the series and still just as great as the first time. Love the fanatsy!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great Packing, Good Shipping time. All as expected.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I am very happy with the last book of the series. Everything happened that was supposed to happen. Would have been nice to read a little more on Katniss & Peeta's life with their kids, but otherwise a great book.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Great action and good story.  It's like the Walking Dead but with aliens. Somewhat hokey though. Flew through season 1.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Great read, couldnt put it down. The movie was fantastic. I sometimes wonder what it would be like if our world had to be tributes, and whether it would teach us anything...
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of this new take on an old favorite.  Great special effects and switch from animation to real acting.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|Book two is great. A little weird with the brother/sister attraction, but thank god they arent really related... (Sorry if I just ruined it for anyone) Love the vampire/werewolf thing along with other beasts. Cool series.
B0001I561E|5.0|Had to replace my vhs tapes with dvd's.  Glad I found it!  It was hard to locate this one. Didn't even have it on the Disney Movie Club.
0425263908|1.0|No real story line here. Only sex and with 5 orgasms each time, over and over. Come on... make it a little more realistic.
B00026WU7I|4.0|It is hard to get used to new Dylan if you play the ecomearly ones frequently but I think come a regular this CD will become a regular in my play rotation
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|I had never heard of M83 prior to this score but I was blown away when I first listened to it. Then I understood that this was also co-produced by Joesph Trapanese who delivered the awesome Tron Legacy and Uprising soundtracks and I knew this was going to be good. So much in fact that I listened to this score two more times back to back! It does not let you down.<br />This score is exciting, has a great pace for adventure, and covers the spectrum of both the movie and your imagination capable of telling a story all on its own.<br /><br />Add in the incredible song by Susanne Sundfør and it delivers a great 1-2 punch. I had downloaded the song long before the score but was pleasantly surprised to see how it all fit together as a soundtrack and in the movie. Great work!<br /><br />It does not disappoint and anyone looking for a sci-fi adventure while in the car, exercising, or relaxing this will fit just nicely.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|This let's me print from my kindle which is great. However it was difficult to set up and I still can't print web pages. Don't know if I just haven't figured it out or if it is not possible.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Following the intense and action packed scores from Batman and Inception, Hans Zimmer delivers another knockout in Man of Steel. The music is compelling, emotional, and strong as it paints the picture for the new Superman vision. A more serious tone it takes you on a journey similar to the Dark Knight saga so that you can feel the story as well as see it.<br /><br />My only concern is that there was no tribute to the main William's Superman theme but that was probably lost by WB wanting to set a new era for Superman as Zimmer had done when they broke away from Elfman's Batman theme from the 80's. Still it would have been nice to see. There is a lot of value in tying these together but maybe that is something only us fans expect.<br /><br />24 tracks with one of them being 28+ min long is excellent. All the tracks are a must listen too. It really is great when you spend a bit more for a score soundtrack and you get your full money's worth. If you appreciated the last few scores from Mr. Zimmer then you will truly appreciate this one.<br /><br />A must buy for fans of scores!
B001EAWMGA|3.0|I thought I was ordering a movie about Jamie Fraser and Claire Randell, main characters of the &#34;Out;lander&#34; series of books written by Gabaldon.  Imagine my disappointment when it turned out to be science fiction.  However, my husband really liked it and wants to get the rest of the series!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|The only addition to this app that would give it five stars in my opinion, would be the inclusion of bookmarking capabilities and hyperlinks imbedded in pdf documents.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This show is great because it is original and makes sense, well as much sense as a time traveling doctor can make sense.  Every episode is great fun!
B005DC68NI|5.0|This book has it all - from the why to the how - where self publishing is concerned. I learned a lot and it was particularly informative about tips for the how-to.
1451668945|5.0|I love all of Mary Higgins Clark's books.There are never any offensive words or situations in her books..Can't wait for her next one.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|Hello.<br /><br />I give this product a three star because it was ship in very quickly. It came like two weeks early although it was coming from another country, but the reason why I didn't give five stars was because the case was broken in pieces. In other words it didn't had enough protection.<br /><br />Thank you for this item I don't know if it works good because It was going to be a present and it came right on time; the only problem is the case!!!
B0058PJ6NE|4.0|I have noticed that In the past few months it has to force close but other than that it is pretty seamless and for those who are looking for the search bar you push the magnifying glass on the right side oh your screen to pull it up thank you for reading -the silent reviewer-
B00C061I3K|5.0|the sound is really evolved, with  original roots. Daft Punk never fails, can't wait for them to tour next year.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|This was a fun game until it crashed my Kindle Fire after 2 days, getting just 6 dinos and upgrading them a couple of levels.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|it was a very good movie. I enjoyed it a lot. it was a bit different from the book but most book to movies are. I highly recommend this movie.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game continues to amaze me.  It keeps your mind and coordination sharp....  It is an excellent activity for all family members, from the children to the Grandparents.
B001F12J0C|4.0|Enjoy the Borne Trilogy for many hours...only wish that all three were on one disc but it is all good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is very entertaining and adicting and I just love it and I think that you guys should make more games like it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think this is an awesome game If you don't mario bros then this is the best game to have also there is leps world 2
1591845556|5.0|This is a brilliant expose of the mechanical reality that the first efforts to learn a new skill will pay huge dividends, compared to an equal amount of effort in learning a more advanced nuance of that same skill later on. I have always been fascinated with the \\"it takes 10,000 hours of practice to get REALLY good at xyz\\" factoid, but here's the necessary counter-point. Who needs to be world-class in anything? Twenty hours will advance anyone past 95% or even 99% of everyone else, no matter the particular skill or task. That's good enough for me...<br /><br />What I especially like about Josh's book is the utter believability of it. No theory or mumbo-jumbo philosophy.<br /><br />What 20 Hours boils down to is simplicity and mechanical reality: Topics that are near and dear to me personally. This book is a winner.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This is a great game but I can find better games then this crap<br />But there are swear words in it like danm and hell oh well
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I loved Bare to You and Reflected in You. Really loved them. This book was just Ok to me. There wasn't as many heart felt moments, smiling/laugh out loud moments or any tears. It did get better and interesting towards the end. I love Gidion and Eva and look forward to reading about them in the next book.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|this is one of the best shows on tv today, it has a great cast and they seemed to fit well together. I would recommend this to anyone who likes funny (not silly), yet serious cop shows, it has great humor and serious subject matters.
B00A6WSTIW|4.0|Deep Blue Sea is a very entertaining film with exciting actions and without a dull moment throughout. The anamorphic widescreen picture is excellent.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|this is one of the best shows on tv today, I would recommend it to anyone who likes funny, yet not silly, and serious yet not sad, cop shows. You won't be disappointed, I promise
B000IYU9IG|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies. I can't get enough of it! It makes me laugh and thing of times when they made good movies and not junk for movies!
B006IYFCIM|5.0|Great book for anyone. Scientific studies to backup their information. I would recommend this to anyone, especially managers, law enforcement, etc.
B00BRUYQFC|3.0|THOUGHT I WOULD CHECK HIS MUSIC OUT.  WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH HIS MUSIC AT ALL, MAYBE YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT AND GET USE TO IT OVERTIME.
159463176X|3.0|I really liked his first two books, but this is just a few linked, disjointed stories none of which in the end feels very deep or substantive.  The book starts out great but gets progressively unintersting and riddled with irrelevant story lines.  I suppose he was trying to provide a panorama of events related to people with a link to Afghanistan, but at times it felt like the linkages were forced and had to be expressly told to the reader (x was a neighbor of y from the last story, a was the guy who moved into the house from an earlier chapter, etc.).  It became a struggle to finish and I wish he had concnetrated more on fewer characters/events to really rope in the reader.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Exercises your brain and keeps your mind young.  I would recommend this game to anyone who needs to work on memory skills.
B001NLL93W|5.0|There are not many series that suck me in as much as this series has. This is a great book. There is never a dull moment.
B008C20TDG|3.0|A brief description of my background:  I have been researching health & fitness since I was 16 years old, when my brother in law informed me that I was “getting fat”, I am now 44.<br /><br />If you are new to a Paleo/Primal/Ancestral lifestyle I would recommend this book as a good starting point.  If you are well versed with this type of lifestyle you won’t find much new information in this book.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|My four year old son likes this game, though the noises coming out of his Kindle are very annoying to listen to.  Of course, he'd probably like anything with Iron Man in it, based on his love of Iron Man underpants.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|A brief description of my background:  I have been researching health & fitness since I was 16 years old, when my brother in law informed me that I was “getting fat”, I am now 44.<br /><br />This book is the layman’s version of Gary Taubes original, and far more technical, book “Good Calories, Bad Calories” which I have also read.  This is one of the books I recommend to people who ask me how I maintain such good health.  The information I excellent and provides and easy to understand scientific explanation of what causes people to gain body fat.  If you choose to read this book, prepare yourself because it will explain why conventional wisdom, our government guidelines, and even what your doctor tells you about eating healthy is wrong.  From my experience, MANY people are just not ready or willing to accept this information.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook is watching me all the time.  They watch me when I sleep, they watch me when I eat, and they watch me on the potty.  I don't want them to watch me anymore.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved it.  A different perspective on individuals working in a domestic environment and retaining their own personalitie.<br />Would love to see Season 3 when Prime offers it for their members for free.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Not read her before, but will again, an interesting twist to a regular who dunnit. Liked her writing style, not too complex to overly detailed.
B001OKJU4M|4.0|Crazy, nice, psychotic Michael Douglas. A very different movie for him, but as usual... He is just an helluva good actor.
159463176X|5.0|I read both of his previous books and this one was just as wonderful page turning read as I expected
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Great family movie! My daughter loved it when she was a toddler and now my son is a toddler and it's still a hit!
B006TKP2B2|4.0|Very unique setting and characters. Although the ending was within acceptable possibilities, I felt the political risks taken by the Environmental Ministry were less likely than the alternatives.
B000002GBB|5.0|&#34;Pieces Of Eight&#34; along with &#34;The Grand Illusion&#34; both are Masterpieces.They are the best Styx albums definitely.Great singers,great musicianship.The band is at its peak.In my viewpoint is a concept album because there´s a kind of link song after song.The whole album is fantastic.You find out killer songs like &#34;Sing for the day&#34;,&#34;Renegade&#34;,&#34;Blue collar man&#34;,&#34;Pieces of eight&#34;,etc.I strongly recommend this cd.It´s a MUST.And you can buy it on Amazon for a penny.P.S:It needs a new remaster.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game!!!  Something that I like about this game is when I get knocked off the Internet or there was connection problem they always return my coins as soon as I come back to the game.  Love that!!!
B000002GB2|4.0|This is the last album with John Curulewski.After &#34;Equinox&#34; he left the band.It´s a great album.It has a good bunch of songs and some of them are Styx¨s classiscs like &#34;Lorelei&#34;,&#34;Prelude 12 along with &#34;Suite Madame Blue.It´s easy to recognize the contributions of each member of the band.I love the album completely.If you are a Styx fan ;you should get it.There´s a good price on Amazon.The sound is good,not great.This is the first edition from the 1990.I bought it because I love the band and because there isn´t any new remastered edition.Perhaps the terrible arguments between Denis de Young and the rest of the band make it difficult any agreement for a new remasters series the fans are waiting for.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|Rereading this book even more pleasurable.  It is a timeless delight.  Just the thing for a summer escape without all the smells and trials of that period in English history.
B00C5XBAOA|2.0|I bought this as an add-on to the Disney Sofia The First Magical Talking Castle, since they are needed to unlock additional voices in the aforementioned &#34;talking castle&#34;.  Only problem is each character is supposed to talk in their respective voice, yet everyone talks in Sofia's voice except Amber.  Another major downfall?  All three children's heads pop off without any effort whatsoever.  Thankfully my 2.5 year old knows not to put things in her mouth, but that's another story for 15 month old.  So now these toys have to be put away when he's awake and my daughter can only play with it when he's not around.  She is a huge Sofia the First fan and we preordered these items months ago.  I wish I could return them but my daughter would be devastated.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|If you need an alarm clock, This is it . Great for travelling. I like that it is simple and straightforward. Thank you.
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|For the price--these are great. I do not like the plastic clamps that some with throttles, but I hard mounted them to my flight sime table and they look great
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Although a little short, the puzzles are fascinating and challenging, and a lot of attention to detail is required to complete the game... well done!
B000FA675C|5.0|The book was well written and gave a lot of clues to some things that were going to happen later in the book.  Kept me in suspense the entire reading.
B008ROELL0|5.0|Although this is an older movie, Michael Douglas does an amazing job demonstrating how many of us have felt at one time or another and the actions that sometimes we would like to take. He also leaves no question as to the consequences of those actions. Great flick!
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|What's the point?  On a Kindle it's very hard to operate.  It is hard to make the first turn. Deleted.
B00D78J7SI|5.0|Hey I understand bands looking to evolve or change because they're bored but COBs last couple releases were bland. Halo of Blood is far better and I can already tell there are parts of songs that are sticking with me. After a few listens I know this will have a lasting effect and I'm happy that they have rejoined my collection.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I got tired of waiting for the Game of Thrones tv series, so I purchased this book. I'm glad I purchased the book because it is better than the tv series. I have recommended it to several friends and they are now Game of Thrones fanatics.
0316223239|3.0|In \\"Reality Hunger,\\" David Shields wrote that the American writer \\"has his hands full, trying to understand and then describe and then make credible much of the American reality. It stupefies, it sickens, it infuriates, and finally it is even a kind of embarrassment to one's own meager imagination. The actuality is continually outdoing our talents, the culture tosses up figures almost daily that are the envy of any novelist.\\"<br /><br />I read \\"Room,\\" by Emma Donoghue, after the three \\"disappeared\\" girls/young women were found on Lorain Ave. in Cleveland. A friend recommended the novel based on that incident and \\"Room\\" is a powerful and creative attempt to imagine the horror of such an imprisoned woman and to observe her behavior through the eyes of her born-in-captivity, five-year-old son.<br /><br />I wonder if Donoghue wouldn't agree with Shields: that the reality of Cleveland \\"stupefies\\" and \\"sickens\\" in comparison with what she dreamed up in \\"Room,\\" which is plenty bleak on its own.<br /><br />And also, oddly enough, \\"Room\\" is at times full of joy. We observe most of this story from the perspective of Jack, the five-year-old.  His observations show a keen, sprightly mind at work--though that mind only knows the small space he's inhabited all his life. So we feel his youth and eager spirit.  Jack's ability to find pleasure in so little, his ability to engage his imagination in such a vivid manner, and his growing awareness, as the book progresses, that there is something more out there, makes for a memorable first section of the book.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I found the second half of this novel to be flat-line and a bit repetitive. Because of the thriller-suspense arc embedded in my reading genes, I assumed that the tension created in the first half of the book would redouble itself and ramp up to a new level. No. The second half of the book plays like more like a straight novel about re-birth.  This felt like an odd mash-up.<br /><br />The novel form is meant to be toyed with (nothing I dislike more than pure formula) and I admire Donoghue's willingness to play with the rules, but I found less and less reason to keep reading as the pages turned. Jack's vocabulary is spotty.  He seems not to have been taught one expression so he takes everything at face-value and the constant explanations grew wearisome.<br /><br />But it's hard not to read \\"Room\\" and ponder how reality often trumps fiction.  Donoghue seems to understand this. The best part of the book is when she lets us observe Jack's mother wrestling with the story she has concocted to keep Jack content with their confinement.<br /><br />\\"Are stories true?\\" Jack asks about the books his mother reads to him.  She replies: \\"Stories are a different kind of true.\\"el form is meant to be toyed with (nothing I dislike more than pure formula) and I admire Donoghue's willingness to play with the rules, but I found less and less reason to keep reading as the pages turned.

B00BN3ECTS|5.0|Best love story/thriller of the year! Several twists and a payoff you'll never see coming. Loved this movie. Saw it in the theatre when it first came out and knew I had to own it. We've been to the city of South Port NC where this was filmed and love the town. This film reinforces the beauty of this quaint seaboard town. I think I'll watch it again tonight.
B000I3P3EM|4.0|I'd seen it when it originally came out in the theater and don't remember being that impressed with it, compared to II,III & IV. But I really liked it this time.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game!! I like how it's not too easy. Sometimes it can be a challenge to stay alive. Be aware of the scuba divers they will kill you if you don't eat them!! :) but I give it 5 stars
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Image quality was great, this is one of my most favorite Disney movies, and the two day rental was great
B009XIXVU6|5.0|once again shapes a tale that catches the imagination and makes characters come alive through decades.  The parallel stories of love,loss, and Afghanistan culture will rest with the reader well after the last page.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|I have no quarrel with those who found this a superior picture. Taste is taste is individualized. I do not say this is not a good picture. All I can say is that I did not find it satisfying. I suspect this will also be true of some number of other potential viewers. There is no coherent order to which most of us are accustomed, there is no clear delineation of what the point is, the acting of the principals appears fine, but is it;  how would we know if it is aimless and self-contradictory. I recognize that to those raised on the Waiting for Godot style, these  may not be issues. They were for me. By me, so to speak, this is an art-house, off-off-off Broadway, Dadaist, University  experimental film. Usually, when I put on a movie with which to relax after dinner, I want something straightforward to watch. In sum, the potential viewer should figure out what he/she is in a mood for and judge this as a choice which is not what most movie-goers are interested in.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Personally, this is a splendid window into the Tudor royalty. But I grant how it can turn off some folks due to some very questionable soap opera-like elements. It seems to track fairly well with history as per Wiki. Felt terrible about Anne Boleyn. Half the series involves her. She was a tragic contender. BTW, there is an interesting 5-min clip in YouTube where Natalie Dormer talks about her role as Boleyn. Henry #8 was bizarre and monstrous. IF the series is true, they should pronounce a curse on him for homicide against so many of his own people. Ugh.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved it. Worth reading before you watch the movie. Good for ages 13 & up in my opinion.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Watching Hannibal unfold every week is like delving deeper and deeper into madness, until you're not sure anymore that madness is the right word. The two main characters, Will Graham and Dr. Hannibal Lecter, play brilliantly off each other.  Each brings their own &#34;madness&#34; to the table, with Will feeling things so deeply it gives him insight into the most horrifying crimes you'll ever see on film, and Dr. Lecter having no moral center whatsoever, even as he helps Will solve those crimes.  It's a brilliant show, with plenty of nods and callbacks to the films that inspired it, but this is a very different Hannibal Lecter than we're used to.  Here, when we see him start to care about someone, it's genuinely frightening in a way that the Jodie Foster/Anthony Hopkins relationship wasn't.  Hannibal is an apex predator, and attracting the interest of a predator as intelligent and ruthless is just as dangerous as being rude to one.<br /><br />The show is artful in its execution and always manages to surprise.  If you enjoy the more psychological aspects of crime drama, you won't find a better drama.
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|My kids and I were in awe of the graphics and the story.  It was great!!!!  I would recommend to anyone.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|This is a pretty simple good vs evil movie. There are some great action scenes and special effects are very well done.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|You will like it. Nothing fancy. Just a great looking and working calculator. It offer all basic features of normal calculator...get it
B00BJS7104|5.0|Jamie Foxx has grown into a great actor. He skillfully adds just the right amount of subtle humor to his roles, to remind you the he is still a comedian at heart.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Helps me keep up to date info on my stock portfolio.  Easy to use and makes me money! What else could I want from a free app. Thanks amazon.com
B0094M2X6Y|5.0|I don't understand why this movie did not do well at the box office when it first came out. It's a great story.
B0064MGU98|5.0|We've only watched the first six episodes, but from what I've seen so far, it's great! Great premise and storyline, very well written, interesting array of characters with lots of room to develop them further. So far the focus has been primarily on the cases, which have all been very interesting and engaging. Looking forward to seeing more!
0374214913|5.0|This is my favorite novel in ages - read it, and immediately reread it!  It's light, but intreguing - fanciful, and fun - extremely well written.  Also has insight into people's motivations and relationships.  Would expect it to appeal to a wide range of ages.  Look forward to more from this author.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|I love the simplicity of their sound and their groove. Britany's voice is classic soul all of its own. Great new music.

1594204217|4.0|I really like the way Michael brings a purpose to enjoying and mastering the processes of cooking.<br />A very good read to anyone who wants to fully understand a process.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|I waited so long for this book...in fact I counted down the days.  Imagine how disappointed I was when the book ended without finishing the story.  I was looking forward to an ending for Gideon and Eva not a fourth book.  It was supposed to a trilogy!
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game works great on my kindle fire. Tons of levels to play. I love  to play it to pass the time.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I am always so very impressed with Dr. Wayne Dyer and tonight on PBS he had Anita Moorjani on and she recounted her experience in the hospital room when she was in a coma and she could hear everything that was being said and could not understand why her family could not hear her as she was trying to speak with them but they were not aware of it. I have always told people that whether it be a person in a coma or one that has had a stroke, people can hear you even though they can not respond. I had a TIA and I tried everything in my power trying to get my husband to look at me (as I was screaming inside) and he had no idea, until he was going to bed and realized, I was not responding, just starring off in space). It is such a scary thing when you are trying to speak, yet nothing comes out. I am ordering the book, for I know it will be well worth the money.
B000T433CO|5.0|One of my favorites...!! ...this is my second copy...wore out the first one.....watch it for &#34;girls night&#34; we all love it especially at Christmas<br />F
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal. The erotica was delicious, of course, but the plot twists were intriguing and scary and fun. I look forward to more adventures for Ana and Christian. The series was all that friends said it would be. I would definitely recommend the series to friends.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game. I love playing it and it is better than all the other solitaire card games. Would recommend it to anyone.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|Wrote noise helps me go to sleep at night and distracts me with soothing sounds that distract me from all the noises in my house. You should get white noise it is an amazing app.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|In strategy, the movie reminded me a lot of \\"The Prestige.\\"  As soon as the movie was over, I felt like watching it again.  It's a great story that some people might find boring.  Ignore those people though and watch the movie anyway.
B0061US58C|5.0|Funny movie. My son loves this movie and I've now seen it about 10 times. Gets funnier each time, unlike some of his other favs (Super Why, et al). We own the DVD but he wanted to watch it while away at grandma's so we rented it.  Really, grandma wanted to see it too. :)
B00BMUVUZG|1.0|I have read and enjoyed all of John Grishan's books, but This book appears to be targeted at a young audience.  Wasn't obvious prior to purchase.  only read about 25% and then gave up.  Too obvious a plot etc
B00785P2QC|4.0|Lots of detail and tons of fun. Great game f o r people who want to play SimCity but can't afford it
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|We found ourselves gasping right along with the characters in the movie. Naomi Watts never acted better while being completely beat up by her ordeal
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is seriously one of the best movies to come out in the past like 10 years.  Definitley worth it to snag the combo pack!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Holy crap! Drew was a piece of work! I loved him! Sexy, intelligent, witty, arrogant, driven - and the way he doted on Mackenzie ... charming. I really enjoyed the book from his POV.<br /><br />The secondary characters were outstanding as well. He had very close ties to the people around him. The scenes with the family and his best friends were gems. Alexandra was deliciously wicked! The Bad Word Jar was hysterical! His advice to Mackenzie was priceless! Sister Beatrice and Matt's CPS ... haha!!<br /><br />Kate and Drew were fun and hot. I enjoyed their banter and the smoldering attraction between them. They were equals in so many ways, but they also made each other better. They stumbled on the way to happiness, but it was an interesting, and at times amusing sequence of events that led them back to each other.<br /><br />This book was entertaining from beginning to end, although I was left wanting more from Drew and Kate. But, there's always the next book.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|What can I say about Clint that has not already been said?  Great movie will plan on watching it again.
B005544TRQ|5.0|MY wife and I love this show... Season 1 is free VOD with Prime membership so if you have it... check it out.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia wrote another exceptional book.  I waited for Entwined and was completely satisfied with the the ending....this means there will be another book...why all the bad reviews?  If there was not anticipation with Eva and Gideon, then how could book #4 happen?  The book was perfect as Eva finally becomes her own person and Gideon becomes a bit submissive to her.  The story will continue and I CANNOT WAIT !!!  This was worth the wait.  Thank you Sylvia.
B004C00EM8|5.0|The movie came when it was suppose to, and even thought the movie wasn't exactly what I thought it was, it was still really good. I give my overall experience 5 stars because I got it on time, and I loved the movie. Im glad i got it on blu-ray so i can watch it when ever I want.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This games is fun. I wish there were more rooms. You just can't help but to keep playing. Worth the download.
B007WULJ5G|5.0|This was the whole film. uncut and had the parts taken out from most of the others. The only downside to this is the packaging. It looks like a bootleg movie, but the actually quality is awesome, and this is probably the only DVD you will find that is truly uncut. I'm glad i bought this one.
B009L7MD44|2.0|Technically, it does what it says - it can transfer files wirelessly. The problem is, it will leave them in a no mans land on your iPad. Hence, when I transfer music, yes, I can play the music in the iUSBport simple music player, but the tracks don't show up in the 'Music' ie iPod section of the iPad, hence none of my music apps can see the new tracks. Disappointing. So, I haven't tried all files, but it will vary if you can actually open the files in your apps once they are on the iPad.<br /><br />One tip - use the iUSBport app to move folders of files, otherwise you're just moving 1 file at a time, cumbersome.
B008KP6ENE|3.0|gets boring quick<br />really boring once you start to actuelly play, kinda like mario. i dont like it very much
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One might read the summary of the book and think &#34;chic lit.&#34; And, not that there's anything wrong with that genre. But this story is still so much more than that.<br /><br />It was a wonderful story where the reader could see such a wide array of character development and change. I've recommended this to many people and will continue to do so.
0679457313|5.0|The God of Small Things has remained in my top 5 books of all times list since I first read it fifteen years ago, and since I've read at least two books a week for over 50 years, that means it's in my top 1%. The book is brilliant, poetically written, haunting, guaranteed to cast a spell over you. It is not an easy read, and in fact, you may struggle a bit while reading it to figure out what's going on, but that's partly the author's intention, to keep you wondering and emotionally engaged.<br /><br />As you read it, you're likely to start becoming aware of its multi-levels - poetic, literary, psychological, interpersonal, socio-political, all interwoven together and unfolding, much like a rare and powerful dream that reaches deep within you connects with the substratum of both personal and collective unconscious.<br /><br />If you feel too confused reading it, and even if you don't, I recommend reading some of the articles and guides regarding the book which you can find online and are likely to enhance your reading of the book.<br /><br />This is a do-not-miss book, truly a classic of the late 20th century, and worth the patience it may take when you start reading it to get used to the author's style. My highest recommendations.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think Hill Climb is fun, addictive and intellegently made. Who knew flipping a guy on his neck to hear the crack would be so much fun?
B0064MGU98|5.0|Fabulous acting and a very, very well written script. The Good Wife is THE premiere show on TV this season. It's nice to go back and catch up on missed episodes.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read!I laughed, cried, smile, and couldn't wait to see the characters unfold. This type of book isn't usually the kind I would normally go for but it was a great read. After reading life really gets put into prospective! I would recommend to anyone looking for a good story!

0553386697|5.0|No one book is a cure-for-all, nor does any single strategy work for every child and/or every parent.  That being said, the simple to understand and apply concepts in this book cannot do anything but help any parent-child relationship.  It's not a fix all, but an amazing way to begin to look at any/every situation though slightly different eyes -- and what parent wouldn't be helped by seeing a situation through a different lens.

B008JFUPFI|4.0|Man of Steel (2013) Rated &#34;PG-13&#34;. Running time: 2 hours, 23 mins.<br />Directed by Zack Snyder. Story by David S. Goyer, Christopher Nolan. Superman created by Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster.<br /><br />Fans who fondly remember and still enjoy the Christopher Reeve &#34;Superman&#34; movies [[ASIN:B000IJ79VQ The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection (Superman - The Movie / Superman II / Superman III / Superman IV - The Quest for Peace)]] (1978-87) may enjoy this re-telling of Clark Kent/Superman, but there are many differences.<br />  The movie begins on the planet Krypton. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is awaiting his wife, Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer), to give birth to their newborn baby. It is a son and he is named &#34;Kal-El&#34;.<br />  Later, General Zod (Michael Shannon), kills the Kryptonian Council. Jor-El swims into the Genesis Chamber and obtains a skull that has the codex to continue the Kryptonian race. This is exactly what the evil, General Zod is after because he wants the power.<br />  Knowing himself and his wife will not survive the destruction of Krypton, he puts his newborn son in a spaceship with the codex. The spaceship lands in Smallville, Kansas. Kal-El is found by Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane).<br />  That is all I'm going to tell you.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Well it is an amazing game it's my favorite but it would be cool if you can drive cars and stuff you make
B00BDSRISA|4.0|Like this album. It's not my favorite, but many of the songs on it are good and I haven't been disappointed.
0756407915|5.0|It is an excellent read! Thank you, Friend, for recommending it to me. It portrays in adventure-quest, whose power (magic [AKA sympathy]) rests on the power of the mind an ingenuity. Interspersed within the story are quotes of wisdom akin to diamonds in the rough. Yet, within its text is the representation of a character who, through is story, is reluctantly attempting to find his purposs.
B007CIQ4B2|4.0|This CD is great! Very mellow, with great lyrics and instrumentals. I truly enjoy Ben Howards' voice on this album! A must buy!
B00D3V5V7U|4.0|I think that still can do better. Hope there is a 14 on its way. Come on guys you still got it.
B0085FF55W|2.0|ONE good track on this album. ONE. I started listening to it this morning while I was getting ready for work, and actually TURNED IT OFF after 3 songs. I am SO disappointed in this purchase. I'm usually very open with music, but this CD is TERRIBLE!!! Background singers are a chorus of what sounds like children... which is NOT to my liking at all! If it wasn't for the ONE song on the album that I like, I would DEFINITELY return this CD!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Just started playing and can't put down this fun and<br />challenging game.  I encourage you to try it as it is easy to learn and fun to try and get better at this game.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I really wanted to love this movie. I wanted to laugh.<br /><br />Instead, my husband went to sleep and I spent date night bored to death.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|My enthusiasm for the book ebbed and flowed..Like Harold.  I felt the writing lacked clarity at times and continuity.  As though it had been written over a long time with many long intervals.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Liked the twists and the chemistry between the characters would recommend this book to my mystery loving friends in a heartbeat
072325804X|4.0|A sound compilation of Potter's children's books. The drawings are faded and not as I remembered them from the original books, but still a book worth having.
B008Y6RYDS|2.0|They say this is a classic. I guess I can see why, but I truly did not like this movie. Way too indie for me. Too many artsy undertones. And it was like one big music video.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Flows smoothly and great card action when you win! Nice for when you need to wind<br />down. I enjoy it and recommend it.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|What a classic! Still pertinent today. My daughters love it and so do I! The ending is just amazing.  Even after seeing it 100 times in my life!
B00BHU261S|3.0|The movie's writers tried too hard to insert drama around the man and create a Hitchcockian story about Alfred Hitchcock.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This album takes you on a ride. Glimpses into the mind of genius and madness and sadness and love are all over this thing like white on rice. I Appear Missing doesn't fail to stand up the hairs on my arm. What an amazing album. Buy it. Live it. Love it. Be it. Let it soak into your skin. Wear it like a suit. You'll dig the way you feel.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Stopped watching after 15 minutes. Maybe it gets better, but didn't want to invest any more time trying to find out.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|it is a great cd and it was like new like they said it was it was not scratch it was a good cd
1439127727|5.0|What an outstanding book!  Authors really did their research.  I always knew of the &#34;club,&#34; but wasn't aware to the degree of how much help past presidents actually helped a sitting president.  And all the negative campaigning is all forgotten ... well, mostly.  This is a must read for anyone interested in American History, or even Political Science.
B000T00PE2|4.0|I must admit that this really isn't the type of music I generally listen to, so I don't have a great deal of insight into the genre as a whole.  However, I find this is generally pretty good for when you are doing something and just need something going on in the background.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Ego, ego, and more ego.  Look, these guys were all very talented musicians ... I don't think there's ever been anyone who thought otherwise, but The eagles is a BUSINESS first!  This comprehensive autobiography of the band is for serious fans only.  It tells the story from the band's inception right through present day, telling you WHAT THEY want you to know.  It's too bad they couldn't put personal differences aside and give their fans what they want.  But, hey, this is rock and roll!
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Satch is back in a big way.  While I love all of his work, I think at an overall album level, The Extremist was probably his best put together, listen from front to back kind of album (followed by Crystal Planet).  This album hearkens back to that, it's a solid album all the way through.  I think his outside efforts with Chickenfoot have taken him back to a great song focus, as this is certainly one of his best solo efforts in recent years.  Joe wastes no time at all, because &#34;Unstoppable Momentum&#34; fires out of the gate full speed ahead (&#34;A Door Into Summer&#34; has a similar spirit).  I will say that my favorite song is actually &#34;I'll Put A Stone On Your Cairn&#34; because of its simplicity and beautiful melody - my only complaint is that I wish it were longer, it's gorgeous.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was fun but too short.  Oh well at least it was free!  Hopefully some new rooms will be coming soon.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|great album, like all the songs, was what i wanted now i got to get shinedown,get it youll love it
B005GFPZYK|4.0|An unusual trueful  account from the battlefield by someone actually in the middle of it all.<br /><br />Finally a soldier admitting he loved his job; this is universal with warriors.<br /><br />Trouble on the home front; the number one reason for leaving the services.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|This movie is great.  Thomas Jane is perfect, so is the rest of the cast.  Scary.  One of my favorites.
B000062XFG|5.0|Love this series - season two is even better than season one! I'd recommend this to anyone - especially nerds at heart. :)
B004GXZ69W|3.0|I had problems with my wrist and hand since I work at a computer all day. It had gotten so bad that I couldn't grasp and open the doorknob when I got home. The angle of this mouse helped my wrist. The small size was a good fit for my hand. I didn't have any problems using/figuring out the buttons or setting this up on the computer.<br /><br />However, I also have a problem gripping--especially the muscle that moves the thumb toward or away from the palm. With this mouse being at such an angle, my thumb was not resting--it was having to clinch to hold the mouse and move it around. This caused a lot of tension for me. I had to return this. I had to pay return shipping but didn't have any problems getting a refund.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Better than most Die Hard movies. All the actors did a great job on this thriller, and the subject is timely given all the government scandals recently.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great - and suitable for whole family: no language issues, limited sexual issues.  Would recommend and look forward to more episodes
B004K00NMG|5.0|My daughter loved this movie. She cheered and clapped at the end. Great price too! I would recommend it as good children's movie.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I have such a busy schedule with work and two little boys, but I couldn't put the book down!  Lived it!
B00BTHV05M|4.0|OneRepublic is one of my most fav band and I must say Native is okay.  There are some songs that I find myself repeating many times and there are some songs that are forgettable.  This album is still really good but personally I like their previous albums better.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My son is really liking this app.  It is basically like temple run but on train tracks.  I think we will have hours of fun with it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Andrew (Drew) is one of those guys you hope your sisters, daughters and friends never meet and that you hope to be able to stay clear of if you ever do. He is selfish, narcissistic and used to getting his way. Always. He is also the hero - and narrator - of this story. He meets Kate who happens to be what most of us want to be - smart, sexy and a very nice person.<br /><br />Apart from Kate being perfect, we never really understand why Drew falls for her - and hard. But he does. Head over heels and for the first time in his life. And this is where I was having problems as a reader because I really wanted Kate to find herself a better man because we all know what kind of person Drew is: He`ll cheat on Kate the moment they argue over who`s to stay at home with the kids, when her boobs start to sag or when the sex isn`t as new and exciting anymore.<br /><br />But - and it`s a huge BUT - because of the writing, because of the amazing author of this hilarious tale, I actually found myself rooting for Drew. I wanted him to have Kate. I almost felt he deserved her even if getting her would just be another thing that went his way. And even if he turned into a creepy stalker. I mean, if she`d really not wanted him, his antics would have been more than enough to land him in jail.<br /><br />But nevermind. The book was hilarious and if we can pretend for just a moment that we would have preferred a different outcome in real life, then it was romantic too. And hot. Don`t forget hot!<br /><br />So read this and have a chuckle and a sigh and end up with a stupid grin on your face :-)
B0081336FO|5.0|If you love Sherlock Holmes, you'll find this present-day version to be as clever as the original. You won't be sorry!
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I would recommend this movie my son rented it then begged me to watch it with him and I thought it was cute and I would rent this movie again for the enjoyment Paul is sweet but mouthy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best book out of all I can't wait until the movie  comes out its going to be great !!!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A lovely study of a wounded person existing on the periphery of his society, it's a sweet story with amusing observations. The author hasn't let an insistence on realistic narrative get in the way of a good story. She plays with it as she wishes, which only adds to its charm; very Irish. I liked it.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Another great compilation by this duo. These two complement each other very well. Beth's vocals and Joe's incredible guitar work are just awesome.
B00030DEQE|5.0|works perfectly on Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.1-64<br />I would then expect it would work in Win7, Fedora 18 Linux as well as Ubuntu 13.04 Linux
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I don't play many games, but I couldn't put this one down.  It gave just the right amount of help so I didn't get too frustrated.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love playing this game with my facebook friends.recently the new update no longer allows me to do so! What can I do??
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was easy to read and I found it hard to put down.  I found myself cheering for the heroine throughout her placements in that I hoped she finally would find happiness. Bought it because I think I read that Oprah liked it, but it's truly worth the purchase.
B003G4W49C|5.0|this book changed me, and is now one of my top favorites. I will recommend this book to everyone I know!! Thank you Orson Scott Card.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|Disney had a field day with these remakes of classic children's movies targeted at little girls, and they actually hit quite a few home runs.  `The Secret Garden' was one of them.  The beauty of this particular film is that it really captures the spirit and heart of adolescence while tackling the important and thematic issues such as death, loss and love in a way that never feels overwhelming yet never feels slight.  It is a thin line, and this film treds it rather remarkably.<br /><br />The story revolves around a young orphaned girl named Mary who is sent to live with her Uncle after an earthquake in India kills her parents.  Her Uncle, depressed and mourning the loss of his wife, leaves her pretty much unattended while he travels.  So, she is left in the care of the stern Mrs. Medlock.  After disobeying orders to keep her nose where it belongs so-to-speak, Mary winds up stumbling across her Uncle's crippled son, who shares Mary's stubborn and spoiled demeanor.  The children share a common thread, for they are both in many ways orphans.  While young Colin has only suffered the death of his mother, his father's continued absence has left him bitter and repressed, thrusting his inner turmoil at the world through temper tantrums and demands.  With the help of a young maid and her charming brother, Mary and Colin begin to mend their broken hearts and souls by visiting an enchanting garden that contains the spirit (in a more figurative way) of Colin's departed mother.<br /><br />The themes here are beautifully etched into every frame, and the technical merits here also help to elevate the film.  The score is enchanting, to say the least, and the performances by the entire cast, especially the children, are hugely effective.  Young Kate Maberly is astonishing as Mary, and Heydon Prowse pretty much steals the whole show as the emotionally, and physically crippled Master Colin.<br /><br />Not just a story for little girls, `The Secret Garden' is a touching and moving film for the entire family, young and old, and proves that the magic of the movies is still very much alive and can be found in the most unexpected of places.  A Disney movie centered on yet another orphaned girl may not seem like the most likely place to find such subtle life lessons and yet Polish director Agniesza Holland beautifully pulls back and delivers a soft and sincere look at adolescence with enough restraint to create an authentic atmosphere.for the entire family, young and old, and proves that the magic of the movies is still very much alive and can be found in the most unexpected of places.

B006OOHYIC|4.0|It is simple and complex Very stimulating. Very fun game. Sometimes the obvious is the answer and sometime it is not that simple.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|We just watched this movie last night. I think I may buy it in 3D because it looks like it would be a good one to own. They did a great job with the storyline, it kept moving and added depth as it went along. I really laughed out loud a couple times and some of the comedy was blatant. I thought at the closing credits a lollipop being shattered by a flaming arrow was hilarious and clever. The action, character development and special effects were all well balanced and we enjoyed it very much. Hard to believe they could sprout an entire movie from a fairy tale, but it works!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Love this book!  A very good insight for children in the classroom as to how the &#34;non-normal&#34; child feels. A must read!!!
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|We really enjoyed this prequel. It plays out similar to the original giving nods to the black and white intro and character development between the real world and Oz. There are a couple twists and turns in the plot that kept it refreshing. The special effects were amazing; I might buy it if it comes out in 3D. The only think I would have done differently would be to have it end with Dorothy's house falling on the witch, well that's my creative prerogative! Anyways, I don't think the reviews were too nice but as always there are politics and snobbery involved in those. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|the story was ok but it was not what I expected it to me. Would not recommend to other reeaders.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is so.much easier than playing on my computer at home. As I can play on my computer at home.
076780421X|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies bc not only are they adorable, but it makes you realize how important family is versus work.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I laughed so much and truly enjoyed the man's perspective even though it was written by a woman. She was spot on. I was cracking up and loved the style. As a woman, I should have hated Drew but he's impossible to hate - he's just so honest about who he is with no apology for it. I loved him from the first chapter. I loved Kate too - strong woman but a lady too. The love story was great, sex was hot. The author developed these characters perfectly. I can't recommend it enough. I hope she writes many more books! Loved it!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have really enjoyed the way the fantasy stories in this series have used the history aspect. You really feel as if these could be stories of an ancient time, told in a modern way. I can't wait to see how it all turns out in the end. Keeps you guessing.
B004G600A4|5.0|Fast delivery and good quality movie. One of the best quality movies we have bought. This is also of course one of the favorite movies (for both kids and adults).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was one of the best books ever!!!!! I really enjoyed it and it made we like reading<br />And I think you should write one that is after the last book
0920668372|5.0|A friend gave me this book and I have since bought it for other friends to read to their kids. My kids, now age 7 love this book as it makes them feel SOOO loved. Actually makes the mom feel just as loved! I have such and intimate time with my kids when reading them this book, which I plan to read to them for many more years.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a really really really really good book it v was my favourite book of all time! Thank you for writing them!!!
B00947N6D8|5.0|Fast delivery and good quality movie thanks. This is my kids' favorite movie. My child does however doubt whether the Easter Bunny is truely real...
1439152802|4.0|Pleased with this purchase.  It looks very interesting.  Have not read the book yet so can not offer any more insight.  Thanks
B009FXIICK|3.0|Wasn't as fun as expected. I was not drawn to playing it when I had the extra time. It was ok.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It is nice to buy music and have it available and any device that you have (thanks to amazon cloud) with internet connection. You can also use it with other mp3 files you have on your sister. The only negative happened to me last week when I went to a remote area for a relax mini vacation and my cel phone didn't have internet. But that is life
B00062PN6I|5.0|I have a handicapped brother who loves music and uses headphones so I bought these for him because he goes through headphones fast, he destroys them with using them so often. These lasted a while compared to others and the sound was good.
B000VSQ17M|5.0|Although this album isn't much of a change from Veneer, I still enjoy his style. Favorites on this album are Teardrop and Cycling Trivialities
0937381888|5.0|Got this with my boyfriend for his dad for fathers day. The plan is for them to be able to make beer together. We got this because of the other reviews and the fact that it is not just a starter book, but can be used forever. Looking through it there is so much information and it is very informative.
B005R32L66|5.0|Skype is a great way to communicate with family and friends. I connect with people all over the country. Great.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|I do not use this very often, usually forget I have it. It comes in handy when I want to see a video.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is really cool. Love the story. The graphics are cool. Puzzles get progressively harder. You should get this great game! Enjoy!
B006M4F67A|5.0|i had never played this game and  love figuring out puzzles, only problem is it wasn't enough puzzles and i finished all the one they had. how can i get more puzzles on this game
B001NZF1O6|5.0|I chose this DVD to show in a summer camp. The extras are great! The ideas in the teacher's notes were very helpful. Recommend for any teacher.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this item is something that is taken everywhere on any kind of gadget. i view it to just keep up with everyone of my peoples and sometimes  i post pictures. I'm still learning how to maneuver it
B003B02OQ4|5.0|Anyone familiar with John Grisham's writings knows he exposes the dirty little secrets of the legal profession and of the criminal and civil justice systems. And he does it so entertainingly as well. 'The Client' is my all-time favorite. Read it for pleasure, and read it for an education about how to protect yourself when both the bad guys and the good guys are out to get you!<br /><br />I bought the Kindle edition from Amazon for my new tablet (after installing the Kindle reader app) and it downloaded and installed perfectly even though it was my first try at this sort of thing.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|he is always an excellent actor in anything that he plays. I loved the concept and how he switched so many different roles. Im glad he won in the end
1401937268|1.0|These cards are really hard to shuffle and the words on them detract from the art work. This is the only deck of cards I've ever thrown away.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|i didn't even know it was part of the other movies until i saw it. Excellent movie, i had to watch the others again
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book explains a lot about how some people became great.  It made a lot of sense to me.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|i would recormend this movie to all all of my friends. i can not get enough of downton abby. i am in love with this show
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Disjointed !  Moves too quickly in some places - not quickly enough in others.  Not up to the high standards I place on K. Hosseini's writings.
B002NHGG92|4.0|I'm surprised how good the show is. I am a fan of true blood and didn't think I would like vampire diaries but they do a good job keeping people hooked.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|This game is like any other building/collection game. One thing that is nice is so far it has not made me try to gather a bunch of neighbors to do something.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I am waiting to see if they continue to make movies of the other two.  I liked all the books.
1451688091|5.0|This book was very good. It expressed a lot into Lincoln's believes that are not told in school text books.
B008B1BL4E|3.0|I was looking for an easy read on a new view of history.  Instead, i partially finished reading this book as it got bogged down in details
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Read this last month, 5/13, despite its being published years ago, somehow I had missed it. As one very familiar with all the Clancy / Jack Ryan characters, it was not a predictable read, but one in which the characters were well used in their literary and situational roles. Its also strikingly prescient in its depiction of Chinese cyber espionage and terrorism based on events of 2013 to date. Recommend to all Clancy / Jack Ryan fans. Would be an excellent beach book if you have not yet read it.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so disappointed in this story that I want a refund. I have not finished this book and will not.  The story line is poorly written and none of the characters had a sense of direction. Please quit while you are ahead. There is no need for a fourth and fifth installment as the third installment is a total disaster.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I was hooked from the first episode! This season is just as good as the first one and I absolutely love this tv show. You should definitely buy this! It's so worth it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Constant action and exciting throughout--didn't want to put it down!  You never knew who to trust or what would happen next.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I was not very excited by the promotional media for this film, so when we rented it I was pleasantly surprised. I felt that there is a lot to enjoy, particularly the colorful antics of James Franco's sidekicks the bell hop flying monkey and the little china girl.<br />  Franco himself, However can't seem to shake the sleazeball persona he sets up in the first act. Also, there's a lot of violence. I'm a fan of rough and tumble fun, but the original oz was so remarkable as it was pure magic with basically no violence whatsoever.<br /> In the end this movie is a decent diversion but no where near what it could and probably should have been to stand next to the original.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Very funny and plenty of twists and turns--I couldn't wait to see how it ended!  Great for a summer read.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book was probably one of the best books i have ever read. I am reading it for school and we will get out in a week.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|If you have any sense of the whimsical & fun. this is the movie for you.  As usual Judi Dench steals the show, but Maggie Smith is no slouch.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I was a bit late getting into this show, but I'm so glad I checked it out. The characters are well-written/developed, the story lines are interesting without being too serious, and the dialogue is realistic. Of course, now that I've found it, the network will probably cancel it. Sigh...
0783226888|4.0|Great movie..that Willis, he can do any part well.  Richard Gere is also fantastic.  Wow, what more can I say??
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I have seen this movie four times and I still can't get enough of it. I'm planning on buying this and<br />the Avenger.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This is John Grisham the master.  How else can you measure anything he writes.  The Activist is a thought provoking piece that perfectly presents the Greater Good gone wrong.  It is a classic oxymoron the injustice of our judicial system.  In some ways we are not much different from China or Russia.  A John Grisham fan.
B00992CF6W|5.0|0.7.0  came out yesterday and there is online multiplayer. It comes out soon but for now it is just cakes, buckets, milk, eggs, spawn eggs, and smooth lighting. Best app ever. Worth the price!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Like always John Grisham makes us fall in love with his heroes. A John Grisham fan.  If John Grisham wrote it I will read it.
B004FWPK8G|5.0|I absolutely love this movie; have seen it several times.  Goldie Hawn is perfect as the pampered Jewish bride who suddenly loses her way and joins the army.  And what could be more mismatched then Goldie and the army and yet somehow she finds her way in just this situation.  And figuring out the French guy's shallow meaningless character was brilliant.  Judy, you rule!
B002WY65W4|5.0|Christmas gift he loved it! he always wanted the movie!<br />works great and good quality.<br />Anyone loves a good movie!
B00007BKVC|5.0|I am so happy to be the 200th feedback for this incredible flick!  Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were so incredible as Thelma and Louise.  This movie is never ever dull..you will stay tuned in to every detail of this wild ride!  The ending is perfect considering the mess they are in and the people they have become.  I always hope they somehow made it safely to the ground!  ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES..A MUST SEE MOVIE THAT WILL NEVER DISAPPOINT!! And this was Brad Pitt's breakout movie; he's really good in it and definite eye candy!!
B00129I5SM|5.0|Brand new in box just as I needed it disk were still in perfect condition and movie worked great. Thanks.
B001C3I4UM|5.0|From back when there was such a thing as a &#34;concept album&#34; this is THE album to have. Just replaced my vinyl with an mp3 version and it had been years since I had heard it. So glad I bought this one again!
B001QERPDO|5.0|Whether its a heartbreak or a death in the family, The Script's lyrics are healing and truthful...they really hit home. I already loved them when I bought it. I love their drumming the most. Great gift! I burned copies of it for my friends and they all love it!!!!
B005O7Q6FM|4.0|If your looking for serious melodrama, or 'tear your hair out' emotional scene, then you definitely in the wrong play. Castle is rifled with good humor, bad jokes, and hold your breath action. The Best part of the show: it's not a soap opera. A little B-flicky yes, but still good.<br /><br />Warnings though it can get a little violent and mild cursing. Overall a good show and defininetly something I would recommend watching.
0679805273|5.0|I ordered these books for end of year gift for my class. They came quicker than I expected and were in excellent condition!
B005DJREJS|5.0|This is such a great series.  I would highly recommend, but know it does have harsh language and adult situations. The cast is cleaver and the storyline is something anyone who has been through high school could relate to.  I can't wait for the new season!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun game like the free daily tournament. Can be quite challenging to play if u don't pay attention but easy to catch up if you get behind.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|If you liked the Star Trek series at all, you'll love the movies.  Great science fiction shows.<br /><br />Great characters and new plots on each one.<br /><br />You'll enjoy if you are a Trekkie at all....
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Good product. Worked right out of the box. Anker's customer service is the best I've seen from any Amazon merchant. They contact you immediately after any purchase to ensure you're satisfied. Too bad more companies don't treat us the same as Anker.
B000001F9N|5.0|One of Donna's concept albums, it tells the story of love affair from beginning to end. This was early in her career when Donna used her upper register to sing before settling on her middle range mostly for the remainder of her career. These are the songs that made her famous, the voice, the music, played in nightclubs it was the perfect venue for them. The days when music and lyrics stuck in your head. Oh what a time it was, a magical era. Wish most of you could have witnessed it.<br /><br />Again this is part of a group of Donna Summer cd's I bought to replace the original albums for sound quality as it's difficult to keep vinyl in great condition when it's been played a lot and I wore out most of my Donna Summer albums from playing them so often.<br />They're fun and they bring back so many memories of Donna who listened to and loved all kinds of music herself and that kept her relevant in the business. I was so hoping to hear many new songs from her but sadly that wasn't meant to be so I will keep collecting and enjoying what's available to me and be thankful.
B0030V0PEW|3.0|The author, a surgeon, makes a persuasive case for use of checklists in a variety of endeavors. But, most of the book is redundant and repetitive. His most compelling point -- that it's a human frailty to steer away from using a checklist because leaders feel it would reflect poorly on his/her abilities if he/she need a checklist -- comes at the end of the book and more attention could be given to that point.<br /><br />In summary, this would have been better, if shorter.
B006ISJQ3K|5.0|I again have the original on vinyl but was excite when this was released. First off, Theme From Mahogany is one of my all-time favorites by Diana, Of course Love Hangover got her named Disco Princess and showed us a whole new Diana Ross. &#34;I thought It Took A Little Time (But Today I Fell In Love) was the first single dropped but when 5th Dimension released their version of Love Hangover Motown was forced to release Diana's which shot to no.1 on the charts but killed the first single. What they were thinking to hold back on a guaranteed smash hit for her in the Disco clubs is beyond me. &#34;After You&#34; is a beautiful ballad that Diana does so well on and her very controlled and classy version of &#34;Smile&#34; is great too.<br /><br />In the Bonus Tracks section &#34;Sorry Doesn't Always Make It Right&#34; is a first and only country western tune Diana did, almost didn't know it was her when I first heard it in the 80's. &#34;To Love Again&#34; is another beautiful ballad but my favorite one is &#34;We're Always Saying Goodbye&#34;.<br /><br />Diana's voice was in top form here, just recently solo from The Supremes she still had that 'killer voice'. I would venture to say this is one of my favorite Diana Ross cd's I just love the songs and her voice on this one. I've learned over the years to always buy the expanded edition when you have the chance to, rarely are you sorry as they offer extended versions, previously unreleased and alternative versions of songs. Buy this cd and hear Diana at her finest.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Not much to say about such a simple device, except that it worked and filled the need to replace the original Kindle charging cable, whcich basically fell apart.  The rubber insulation disintegrated.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|I saw this special for PBS three times and still bought the DVD I loved it so much. His voice is so incredibly beautiful and so are the voices of those he duets with including reuniting with Celine Dion for &#34;The Prayer&#34; was so magnificent but for me the highlight and I wasn't expecting it was when he returned for the encore and sang &#34;Nessin Dorma&#34; it made the hair on my neck stand up.<br />In a time when music lyrics and quality and artists now are at an all-time low I am really appreciating the artists of my generation who not only were the best but have stood the test of time. I want to make sure I own as many of their bodies of work as I can.<br /><br />Cd's such as this one can be brought out every holiday season and enjoyed. I especially like having all the concerts, I just keep putting on different ones  and with today's bigscreen tv's and sound systems it's almost like being at the concerts.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|I am a sucker for disaster films done well and a sucker for anything with Jake Gyllenhaal or Dennis Quaid in it.  This movie is a good winter evening watch.  Cuddle up with a throw, turn the lights off, the sound system up and enjoy!
B000HZHBIM|3.0|I loved the old Star Trek when it was on tv in the 60's.  It was exciting and innovative but this movie was so slow I could have slept through it.  It was good to see the old crew though.  What a lineup!
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|The music is a natural evolution from the superlative This is War, offering an even more orchestral/symphonic sound to amplify Leto's vocals. Every track is solid, though some are a bit short.<br /><br />Overall, this feels more like an EP than a full album, leaving the listener wanting more.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Riordan really found his stride with Kane Chronicles.  The Percy Jackson Series was edge-of-seat exciting, funny, and a quick read without being condescending or simplistic.  This sequel series has the more &#34;grown up&#34; feel of Kane, with all those aspects of Percy.  I simply eat up every book, and I expect I'll keep doing that! Get caught up, and get this read!
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|This is the most important release since Moses brought the Ten Commandments down from Mount Sinai. Commandment 11 should have been - dont f' with the origninal mix.
B00B45FO7E|4.0|A former KRAFTWERK member  who still manages to be relevant after so many years away from the group.  I am running the CD in my IPOD rotation and really enjoying the beats while driving in particular.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I put it down i wanted to re-read immediately. I am not a teen but this book is not just an Young Adult read. it is a fantastic view into a damaged psyche. amazing read. highly reccommend.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game ! If you're a little girl wanting to become a princess someday I think you'll love this app. You'll have to pay for the looked items and princesses. This app is like a real salon and the graphics are awesome! In this app you help the princesses get ready for the ball! If find this review helpful  I recommend you get this app. I'm 9 years old and I give this app a  5 gold stars!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Hopefully, the movie will be more concise. I found the repetition tedious. However, I love the characters and had to see it through to the end.
B006M4RN3U|3.0|the singles that were released are easily the best songs on this album.  when i hear them, i think of Queen.  the rest of the album makes me think of a group of people playing around on their computers, &#34;making music&#34;.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|I've been a fan of Demi for years and I have to say this is my favorite album of hers yet. In Case, Warrior, and Nightingale are my favorite songs on this album. There is so much emotion and energy in all of her songs. This was definitely money well spent.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|finally a chance to hear new material from Tom!  this album really goes back to the Cinderella &#34;Heartbreak Station&#34; period stuff, and that is a really good thing.
B0089LOG02|5.0|One word: AWESOME!!!!! I had never heard of orphan trains and I am 62 years old! Real eye opener. Look forward to acquiring more books
B003PIUBZS|5.0|first season rules totally worth buying the DVD (or blu ray if that's your thing) for the extras on the actors' workouts and training for the show
B003WH765U|5.0|A Tour de Force from Marlon Brando as Major Lloyd Gruver, an Air Force pilot who has just been transferred to Kobe, Japan after many successful missions over Korea.  A born and raised southern gentleman, a man's man, career pilot, slated to marry the commanding General's daughter and traditionally solid in every way until he meets Hana-Ogi, the Japanese theater's most accomplished, beautiful and number one Geisha.  Portrayed by Miiko Taka, Hana-Ogi overwhelms Major Gruver with her sensitive and sensual ways.  Red Buttons as Joe Kelly and Myoshi Umecki as Katsumi, steal the film with their performances as a couple who wed despite the odds.  Their love for one another knows no bounds.  Slowly, Major Gruver learns what life is like when seen through the eyes and heart of the beautiful Hana-Ogi and how much he has missed through all the years as a military man who has to toe the line and live in a way that suits everyone else but his inner self.  The ending is one of the most surprising and satisfying moments in this wonderful film that was far ahead of its time...Sayonara!
055357342X|3.0|An irritating predilection with a Dwarf's sex-life and the disparate stories of loosely connected individuals.  Interesting characters die like flies while story lines ramble on with little direction.  If even George R.R. Martin knows where this series is going I, for one, will be surprised.
0451228731|5.0|The characters are totally believable.  Sucks you in and never lets up!  Terrifying and exilerating!  You won't be able to put this book down.  I recommend you purchase &#34;Freedom&#34;, the follow up to this because you will have to know what happens next.  Action adventure and candy for your brain too!  I loved it.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|It was okay. Plot was mediocre and the graphics did not look realistic enough for me. There could have been more action.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I think this is the best productiono of Persusion ever made. The quality of the dvd was fine--no problems. Recommend
B00D3V85FA|3.0|I don't think I'm the target audience for this particular Black Sabbath album.  It's sorta like a PSA for meth heads...
0800141660|5.0|This is the best movie version of Sense & Sensibility ever produced in my opinion. Emma Thompson, who stars, also wrote the screen play and she deservedly won an award for it. The quality of the dvd itself was fine.
B00BQH9UL6|5.0|It does have a bit of a sing-songy tone - like Dark Light, but overall its grungy and dark and reminds me of the old days.  Listen to When Love Starts to Die!
B001QWBM62|5.0|After reading many reviews over these types of devices i decided to try this one and it works amazing. for starters or experts to use as a handheld mic or anything. then when u wanna step it up XLR inputs on the bottom for that sweet shotgun mic to have crystal clear sound. no noise in the audio and just awesome.
1587613379|4.0|its not my favorite book.  it's not really what I was expecting anyway.  but it does give good insight on the topic, and the authors seem to know what they are talking about.  if you have interest in the subject, read this.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Excellent series of science fiction with a very contemporary theme with excellent audio and video work. Highly recommended and enjoyable
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Had I noticed beforehand that this movie was only 88 minutes long that would have told me that the movie had no character development or real story. The movie is tight and well produced for what it is, but if you watch the trailer on Youtube, you have basically seen the movie, and can save your money for something that has more content.
B004XQO8JG|5.0|One of the best action movies of Sylvester Stallone with a very interesting dynamic that breaks stereotypes of conventional police.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I started reading this series when it first came out.  I enjoyed it for a while and then it didn't advance the plot AT ALL.  Mr Jordan seemed to be writing to milk his fans pocketbooks.  I stopped reading for a little while due to being frustrated with the unmoving plot.  Mr.  Jordan loves the mechanics of battle and as Mr. Sanderson had access to his notes it is highly evident it was well planned out before Robert Jordan's unfortunate passing.  I am glad that his wife decided to bring closure to this epic story and Brandon Sanderson does it justice.
B004RE29PO|5.0|As with the first in the franchise, this second film is a sci-fi horror or horror sci-fi . . . take your pick . . . and just as frightening.<br /><br />Excellent Blu-ray transfer, including the audio. Exceeded my expectations, even though this sequel is a number of years newer than the original film in the \\"Alien\\" Franchise with better cinema technology for filming, special effects and sound.<br /><br />It's very good they were able to get a reluctant Sigourney Weaver back seven years later to do the sequel. The 1979 Alien was directed by Ridley Scott who did a stellar job on that film. This one was directed by James Cameron, who also did a stellar job. The story picks up where the first film ended, providing a nearly seamless continuation.  Watching the two back-to-back as a \\"double feature\\" works very well. The pacing increases a little faster, but it still doesn't hit high gear until the last third with, once again, the relentless aliens (plural this time) running amok. Unlike some of the current horror films that cut immediately to frenetic blood and gore scenes, this one develops the story and the characters. Its seven Academy Award (Oscar) nominations . . . winning two . . . are a testament to the screenplay, direction, cinematography, special effects, and acting . . . and very unusual for a film in the horror/sci-fi genre . . . which are usually better recognized with Saturn awards  . . . this one cleaned up winning eight of them which is no surprise given all the Oscar nominations.<br /><br />Like Scott, Cameron uses a combinations of tension building and shock cuts and a few realistic false scares thrown in to inflict mental horror with visual and visceral terror. There are also a handful of unanticipated surprises left for the end. Special effects are realistic with reasonable credibility (remember: this is a sci-fi story).<br /><br />Those who enjoyed the first film will, without any doubt, enjoy this sequel. I wish I could say the same for the third film, Alien 3, which should have ended the series, and the 4th in the franchise, Alien Resurrection. Both are disappointments compared to the first two, especially the 4th \\"Resurrection\\" film that employs Deus Ex Machina at the beginning so it can proceed to continue the story. A 4th film with continuity from the first three would not have been possible without it. As this film leaves things open at the end, the third provides definite closure if one chooses to end it there. IMHO the franchise should have.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've only done this 3 consecutive days so far, but I'm loving it more than any workout videos I've tried in the past.  I can barely walk due to the muscle soreness it's causing, but i'm way more energetic, and I actually look forward to the next workout.  It's not super girly, so my husband will actually do it with me, and I don't feel ridiculous the way i do with aerobics as i am definitely not coordinated. The exercises are tried-and-true basics, such as jumping jacks, crunches, pretend jump rope, and push ups.  I'm surprised i like it as much as I do, but I couldn't be more pleased.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I first heard Home on the radio and caught it with my Shazam and had to find out who that was.  The lyrics and music were just so beautiful.  So I came home, found it and listened to clips of all of the songs and decided to buy.  Boy was I ever glad.<br /><br />Man on the Moon - beautiful guitar work and a funky kind of beat with a catchy tune.  This is one that can get into my head and not leave for days.<br /><br />Gone, gone, gone - Another beautiful ballad like home, this time a little quicker pace.  Again, his guitar work is nice.<br /><br />Hold On - One to listen to when you've just had enough in your day and you just need something to hold onto.<br /><br />Tell Me a Story - A good singer-songwriter song about living life.<br /><br />Get up, Get down - My favorite on the album after Home.  Great bouncy beat.  Great words.  Another I can't get out of my head.<br /><br />Where we came from - good use of a Cello, rhythmic section, good words about remembering where we came from.<br /><br />Drive Me - Almost equal to Get up in my favorites - hot!  Good beat.<br /><br />Wanted is love - bringing back orchestral instruments, low key, sensual.<br /><br />Can't go wrong - Interesting mix of sound of music and lyrics give impression of rain at beginning.  Cool song.<br /><br />So easy - nice beat, nice sound, quiet mix - love song.<br /><br />Hazel - nice use of the minor key - lost love.<br /><br />Wicked Game - what can I say that I haven't already....<br /><br />This album didn't have to grow on me.  From the time I put it on my itunes I played it over and over and over.  It is SO good.  For a first album it is fantastic.  The melodies and harmonies, use of the minor key, strumming patterns, lyrics all come together to make this singer-songwriter stand out as a diamond amongst all of the coal produced today.<br /><br />Buy it!  TODAY!

B008JGSM6G|3.0|As the title says, FLOW FREE is enjoyable, but it's not very difficult. I would liken it to playing the lower levels of Sodoku...it uses bright, shiny colors on a jet black background, and as there's some thinking involved it leaves you with the feeling you've accomplished something. But really, it's not that tough a puzzle.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I use it to exorcise my mind. Not a bad way to keep my mind active<br />And alert. I like it and crossword puzzles.
B00BSO2U1Y|4.0|Remember when people were having many diverse opinions on the very first period instrument recordings of Handel's Messiah? or Handel's Concerti grossi OP.6? The reactive adjustment from one interpretation to another is definitely interesting and expected.<br /><br />I also have many recordings of Norma (Callas, Gencer, Scotto, Sills, Caballe and Sutherland). I decided to NOT compare this recording to all the old classic ones and listening to it afresh....<br /><br />The result is infinitely rewarding !!!! I have this opera on heavy rotation since I got this recording and I thoroughly enjoyed and moved by all the performers. The singers, unlike the older recordings (which I also love), portrait the characters in a more humanistic scale and less \\"monumental\\" and 'untouchable' as the classic Callas- Caballe- Sills- Sutherland- interpretations.<br /><br />There are really minimal faults for all the singers, as the project deliberately uses delicate lyrical voices and not the helden- or spinto- voice types to do this recording. I actually find that refreshing.<br /><br />The Romani-Bellini word-music fusion is even more evident as now the singers can really make EACH word counts.<br /><br />Even Callas once did something artistically WAY beyond her time at a rehearsal -<br /><br />\\"... A coda: In 1957, Maria Callas portrayed Norma in London and sang a very delicate, small-scale \\"Casta diva\\" in rehearsal. A colleague complimented her on the approach, and she replied that she considered it the proper way to sing the aria--but that Italian audiences, accustomed to heroic voices, would never stand for it... \\"<br /><br />As we see more and more operas being performed with period instruments e.g. Cherubini's Medea, Weber's der freisch&uuml;tz and even Wagner's Der Fliegende Hollander... BArtoli's recording/interpretation is long overdue :)<br /><br />I highly recommend this recording... alongside with all the classic ones I have mentioned earlier :)

B002QYNIHU|5.0|This is the ultimate Son Goku action figure, the sculpt is spot on, the details are amazing, the extra hands and face are awesome; The figure itself have a lot of attitude just being on the package. It is not only super saijan, but super articulated too. The only complaint I can make is the light orange color, that is not the same of its TV´s counterpart, and the size fits right on with most Marvel Legends, and even if you are not a scale nazi, with DC universe. I cant complaint for adding a fine Son Goku Action figure to my collection, specially at the 35,99 price of amazon.

B008JFUPFI|4.0|To start, watch out for the first period of the film, set on Krypton. It's full of sci-fi and comic eye-candy.<br /><br />It was great that Christopher Nolan chose a darker hero for his superhero debut. Given that he'd been directing such-themed movies (Memento, The Following, Inception), wouldn't it follow that the Man of Steel himself would take on a darker tone? While in a few ways it did, Zack Snyder's fantastic vision (as per usual) and Zimmer's cold, bright score helped breathe a different life into DC Comics' newest film feature.<br /><br />While I'm familiar with only some films (and none of the comics) with Superman, I will say I enjoyed this one most. It is a wonderful, emotionally-involved origin story that leads you through the development of this Man of Steel quite well. Henry Cavill plays an extraordinary man learning what it means to be a hero. I appreciated seeing his normal human attitude shine through. After all, he grew up knowing no other way to act.<br /><br />Amy Adams as Lois Lane didn't fit as I hoped, though she did fair. The Daily Planet group did well, but were slightly off-putting. I'm hoping they do more in future films, if they appear. Michael Shannon's was my favorite performance: a near-emotionless (yet obsessed) general with a greater good in mind, and nothing will stay in his way. The climax of the story was just as it should have been.<br /><br />Here are a few ways Nolan's darker presence have seeped in. Krypton is seen as a plague, destroying to survive, but I won't go further into that. The threats in Man of Steel are very real, and have dire effects. This isn't Avengers. People die, destruction reigns. That said, the violence isn't blatant, but does happen. On that note, there is some language and frightening/intense scenes, but nothing more to worry about. I highly appreciate the lack of inappropriate material in this film.<br /><br />In conclusion, Man of Steel has not let much in the past explicitly define it. A unique costume, altered chronology, real terror and threats, character accuracy and development, and more are all defined by this film more than the previous ones (or other superhero films). I recommend it to all fans and newcomers.me, altered chronology, real terror and threats, character accuracy and development, and more are all defined by this film more than the previous ones (or other superhero films).

B005FPT51K|5.0|We purchased the ibabyhot after reading many mixed reviews. Some negative some positive. With this camera I also purchased a wifi extender to put into the nursery. I was a little nervous to plug it in after reading the nightmare setup reviews, but went ahead with it anyway. I read the simple instructions and did just as they instructed. Setup on<br />Y took 3 mins tops. It works perfect. Now I can check in on my little girl from anywhere. I have mine running off the extender on wifi not the cord and they is very little delay. This thing has been a live saver and the added bonus is I can check in on her even at work.  Night vision with this camera is also amazing
B003D513TQ|5.0|Love this movie! Thoroughly enjoyed the perspective and the cinematography. Well told story, with beautiful costuming as well as authentic believable characters.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|COMPARE TO MAD MEN  AN  INTERESTING PART OF LIFE. THAT i MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN.  i WOULD RECOMMEND IT.  HAVE FOLLOWED THREE SEASONS AND LOOK FORWARD TO MORE.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Have all 5 soundtrack of the Twilight Saga - this one is the BEST.  Play constantly and never get tired of!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I am very pleased with this book. This was downloaded very fast and it was a great buy. Thank you so much!!!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I've seen a lot of reviews of this director and of this film. I cannot imagine the amount of dope being smoked by those giving such glowing reviews. Both movies I've seen by this director suck gloriously, they are complete garbage. This \\"movie\\" was a complete waste of time, I kept waiting for it to get better but it never did. Don't waste your time, you will thank me for this warning. BAD ACTING, FILMING, SCRIPT/STORY LINE, LIGHTING, MUSIC, heck even the hairdo's were a joke! This movie blows dead bears!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Dugard gives a chilling account of her experience in captivity. The book's first person point of view allows the reader to put him or herself in Dugard's shoes in a way that would not be possible if it had been written by a ghost writer. That being said, Dugard was abducted at an early age at which time her educational attainment came to a halt. It is important to note that she writes at an elementary level, and therefore this might not be a great read for someone who will find that distracting. In the midst of an era in which abduction and rape seem to be becoming commonplace, Dugard's account of her experience is worth the read.
B0026Q8EWW|1.0|Please take action to stop sending requests for review that I have NOT watched. Am happy to review those I HAVE watched!  Thank you!
0544139453|1.0|OK, forget the plot if you can.  It's flat-out unbelievable enough to have made me stop reading the book two times before I forced myself to finish it.  Just call it the frame of the story within the story.  That tale is mostly about the narrator's abject love for the heartbroken, pale, wealthy Erika who cannot forget her lover who died at 20 something of lung cancer.  Lung cancer??  Yes, I suppose that it could happen.  Still, the love affair has some nice moments although the fact that Changez (first time novelist's bad choice for a name) can't take the place of his dead American rival is an obvious plot device.  So then what?  The reader wants to know why an educated, well-paid Pakistani turns against the USA, right?  You won't get much of an answer other than Erika, I'm afraid, and the anti-Muslim furor after 911.  And you have to put up with the artificial story telling voice and the constant thought that no one in his right mind would keep listening to it, especially if he was sitting in a restaurant in Pakistan.  Unless of course he was an evil CIA dude . . . Well, some critics believed him, the bleeding hearts.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book and series its definitely worth buying. Also in August the movie will come out and you have to read the book before you see it because it will probably be less confusing then
B002QRWJA4|5.0|fans of the Stage show will love this! Emmy Rossum is magical! The score is intact, although a few scenes changed it is still dynamic!
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Great classic! Don't believe any of the negative reviews. This is a wonderful movie I grew up with and who cares if the &#34;Effects&#34; are not AMAZING. It is a wonderful movie.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|I was unable to view the entire  DVD.  I tried it on three different players and the middle portion of the film forward to the end continued to flicker, stall, skip.  Unfortunately time had expired for return and I feel I did not get my money's worth.<br /> Caution: Play the DVD as soon as you receive it to determine if it has defects
B007N6NGYG|5.0|This game is way better than the lite version of train crisis. The lite version has bad animation compared to the full version.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Pretty colors. Wonderful fun great for everyone else .So much fun. Don't be afraid to try this something even the youngest can play. Too easy to get hooked
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|I watched this show 2 times while I had it rented. It was a very funny movie and I enjoyed it alot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was a very great game. It kind of reminds me of templenrun; but in a more modern and stylish twist.
B000YJ6736|4.0|Mr Mcewan is very insightful.  His characters are very believable, especially if you are a child of the fifties.<br />They demonstrate the importance of communication.
0143119680|5.0|The compelling story line, unique take on witches, vampires, and demons, and complex relationship between the main characters is incredible. When I am reading this story, I don't want to put it down, and I keep coming back to rejoin my friends on their quest to learn the secrets of Ashmole 782.
B0018OAOQC|1.0|This album lacks a serious metal sound. Sounds more like a mix between southern rock and hair metal. What were they thinking? I reckon, not much by the sound of this album.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved it. I just hate the ending cause now I have to wait for another book. I just love how Gideon and Eva are now married and they are still figuring stuff out between them both. Poor Cary. I wish him the best of luck. I hope to see this book turn into a movie. :) Great job.
B004IY6API|5.0|Stained Class is one of Priest's best releases during their early days as one of the Metal Gods. Highly recommend this album to any Metal Head.
B00HT2RTU6|5.0|Why this incredible film gets lumped in with HEAVEN'S GATE, 1941 and other films that are held up as examples of all the &#34;excesses&#34; of Seventies filmmaking gone wrong is beyond me. Certainly director William Friedkin was plagued by problems in making SORCERER right from the start, compounded by the bad luck of having it open in theaters the same week in 1977 that some movie called STAR WARS opened. More than that, though, I think Friedkin was pilloried by critics and cineastes for having (by their lights) the unmitigated chutzpah to remake Henri-Georges Clouzot's THE WAGES OF FEAR, often considered to be a classic of French cinema. My goodness, it's like remaking CITIZEN KANE. The horror, the horror!<br /><br />Classics are as classics are. I've watched SORCERER at least 5 times over the course of the last 35 years, and find that, if anything, it only gets better each time, while I've managed THE WAGES OF FEAR a couple of times and own that Clouzot might have had a classic if the dialogue in that movie wasn't so hackneyed and the desolated South American setting where this is all supposed to take place didn't look like a movie back-lot. By contrast, SORCERER rubs the grime and the tension into the viewers face, makes you wonder if these four hapless low-lifes really are going to come out okay, plays with one's expectations and, more to the point, doesn't make ANY of this even remotely attractive while at the same time drawing you in, or at least it's never failed to draw me in.<br /><br />The best news, of course, is that FINALLY there's a great HD transfer of this video available to viewers, both as a Blu-Ray disc and as a first-rate digital download. It only adds to the power that this film already has, and makes this timeless epic even more of an evergreen.<br /><br />Thing is, there's room for both THE WAGES OF FEAR and SORCERER in ones personal movie library. Hopefully someday there will be recognition that the latter is as classic as the former...for me personally, it's even more so.e personally, it's even more so.
B000002GK1|4.0|Next to Superunknown, this is probably the second best release by Soundgarden. Killer riffs, vocals, and dark melodies throughout the album.
B0007QMY0G|2.0|Really what more can I say, it's just not up to far with their previous work. Their first full album, &#34;Homework&#34;, sets the bar quite high. Homework was a change of pace from the normal techno/house music of the late 90's that every seemed to be trying to get in. They followed up &#34;Discovery&#34; which seemed to set the bar even higher. Not only was it a great album, but there was a complete story behind it as well. Human After All just does not meet the standard that they had set before. None of the songs are particularly good and it seemed to be more noise than beats of music. I would recommend staying away from Human After All, but Homework and Discovery are must hear.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This is by far the best CD I've ever bought!! Love this, I listen to this every day!! I don't buy CD's but I love this ONE!!!!
B002FOQY2M|5.0|Fun.'s lead singer Nate Ruess picks up right where he left off with his old band, The Format, in Aim and Ignite. A fresh change of pace in an otherwise cliche and bland era of pop. Aim and Ignite is a blend of a variety of sounds ranging from trumpets, to pianos, accordion, harpsichord, gospel choir, and much more. In my favorite song of the album, The Gambler, Fun. moves as far away from the repetition of lyrics in pop songs as humanly possible, by not repeating any lyrics. It pains a complete story from beginning to end. The album as a whole is a masterpiece of a new age of pop.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Although i am drawn to books concerning women racing to the top while raising families, this book seemed repetitive and written from the point of view of a privileged person which she did admit, and might not apply to that many women who are still suffering with the demands of work and childcare without dependable coverage on the homefront.<br />I feel she is the face and figure of the forty something career woman who also wants to claim Super Mom status, and is sharing  experiences from that generation.  Being a mother of a forty-something who has dual roles, I was interested in reading this work, but found very few surprises, but many references, making this a highly documented work from a Facebook executive.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Enjoyed learning about Yemen (how's that for being sadistic?). Typical DeMille: good humor, well written, believable plot, moves at a good pace.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does everything I need from a calculator. Big buttons and large clear display. I like that it shows the previous entry, so you can keep your place in a calculation after an interruption. My kids love it too. Ages 6 &amp; 8.
B004L35GAQ|4.0|Got exactly what I expected in the expected amount of time so overall I am satisfied with my purchase of this cd
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I was told about this book when I lost my job.  Reading it was great for helping with reframing the situation.
B0094K1QR8|3.0|It just seemed to be more of the same from Ashton - perhaps I was expecting more since I've loved the work of Ms. Portman since she was young.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|My husband wanted this so we pre-ordered it.  He's watched it twice and said it was worth the wait, especially when we got it for a few dollars less than in the stores.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Sylvia Day has been good at keeping the storyline interesting. However, I felt the ending could have been a bit more leaving the reader wanting more. Overall good read.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This book will surprise you and leave you happy and thankful. What a great book! I highly recommend reading this!
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|The third world (Desert World) kills me automatically? It won't even let me try to move out of the way or jump! I really love  the game and would enjoy it even more  if I could pass this world! Am I the only one this has happened to?!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I wanted to watch this film because I am going to be traveling with my son and I thought it would help me get ready for the trip.  It did!  We have to laugh at ourselves and I could definitely see myself in the portrayal of the mom.  I hope my son will be as patient with me and my goofy momness as Andy was. LOL
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book is awesome! The first book is better, so it kinda dulls out this one. Keep writing Kami! Love it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|ok I thought it was spider solitaire at first but its not its just plain old solitaire you might want to tootle how to play to because the don't have instructions
B005NKGEP2|5.0|I enjoyed this book enough to read it twice in a period of 4 months.  It has a very fun twisty plot.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I was impressed with how quickly it arrived and my grandson was very happy with it. At 7 he knows more about what he needs for electronics than I do. Thanks!
B001NA6096|5.0|If you like thoughtful, romantic movies - this is for you. Reading the great reviews for recently released &#34;Before Midnight&#34;, I was intrigued and watched both Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.  You should too - you won't be disappointed.  The performances are wonderful, especially Julie Delpy's - unforgettable.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|My son loves that game. Great activity for little boy. There are many free games to load it. thumb up
B000S1M9LY|5.0|A re-read (or re-listening) comes naturally not from necessity but by choice since the novel is so intriguing. In the end is the beginning, in the beginning the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A real thumb up.  Very cool and so far out game.  My son loves it very much.  Double Thumb up
1932100660|5.0|Whether you agree or disagree with the facts this book presents, everyone should at least be familiar with the arguments made by Colin Campbell in The China Study.  If you are already favorably disposed toward diets that avoid meat and dairy in favor of plant-based diets, then this book will validate the health reasons for eating the way you do.  For those who love their meats and cheeses the information in this book will enable you to make an informed choice about the health consequences of eating a diet heavy in animal products.<br />The China Study presents evidence based on scientific studies of diet rather than opinions based on political agendas.  Today, as the frequency of obesity and Type II diabetes is epidemic, and heart disease, cancer, and dementia continue to be the leading causes of death and disability, The China Study provides well-researched information showing how our dietary choices can provide health benefits which far transcend any that pills and medications offer.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|best game for mobile nothing beats this any thing can try to top this and fail badly awesome thank you for making this game
B0094K20FK|3.0|Great to see these actors as I first saw them in the &#34;good old days&#34;.  Good film with more story than explosion special effects.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have enjoyed the series and appreciate the wrap up but not in he rushed fashion this one was done.
B008F9T76Q|5.0|I was impressed by this trilogy and even when I thought I could predict what was going to happen next, I was wrong every time with how James Dashner changed the plot and the direction of the story.  It was an easy read that was thrilling and kept me motivated to keep reading.  Thanks for such great books!
B0073B587E|3.0|I got this knowing that it might end up just being a toy, but the concept was so good and at the price I couldn't resist. The unit is pretty sturdy, doesn't feel cheap. the app that comes with it is decent as well, with good options, and good for learning too, if you just want to learn the basic chords.<br />But it is difficult to make it work with other apps, which was one of the major reasons I wanted this - from internet forums et al I had read that this is pretty much like a USB keyboard for the ipad. But I found it hard to make it work with a lot of the apps i use - thumbjam, morphwiz amidst others. It does work with garageband.<br />Also so the little more enthusiast, this does have a more than acceptable latency issue, which gets a bit irritating while strumming.<br />Maybe I was expecting waay too much, something like the kitara, and if a product like this achieves that standard, this would be an ace up the sleeve.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series sizzled from beginning to end.  Never a dull moment. I loved the plot twists all throught the series.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|Very cute movie for the entire family.  Beautifully animated, well scripted, and the acting was well done.  Comedic and sad at various points in the show.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|The product does what it says.. I wish there were more games and the SDK was open for other devs to acomodate it in their games<br />Otherwise quick response..
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book was truly inspiring.  What she talks about feels so true for me.  Anyone who feels lost or confused would find great comfort in her words.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|This has got to be the best cop show ever done. Michael Chiklis did an outstanding job as Vic Mackey
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Finally I get my say on this book... I've finished reading and I have to agree with alot of other disappointed folks that this book really leaves a lot to be desired for the $10 bucks I paid for it.  Geez... it might not have been so bad if I didn't feel so price gouged for what I got.  Okay... I LOVE the way Sylvia Day writes... that's why I fell in love with books 1&2.  And this one had excellent moments of top notch writing.  But the content of the writing is what really was lacking in this story and that's because \\"someone\\" has decided to stretch this story into FIVE books instead of what a trilogy really means. (okay enough of that since everyone has commented on it but it did make me mad).  Here's what I HATED about this book:<br /><br />1.  Nothing is resolved or revealed about Gideon and his past.  I mean come on Sylvia...give us something about why he has nightmares and is the way he is.  This is book three of the story for crying out loud and still nothing to explain his weird behaviors.<br />2. Gideon is really \\"dark\\" in this novel.  The way he treats Eva is darker, his acts of sex with Eva are darker(really STRONG dominant/submissive behavior in this book), his dealings with secondary characters are darker... it was kind of creepy and I didn't care for this very much... and Eva just lays back and takes it. He wasn't the Gideon that I thought I came to know and love in Bks 1&2.<br />3. Not a lot of substance in the story plot and just extra added \\"stuff\\" that was put in for filler. The whole Brett relationship with Eva... too much.  Megumi's whole back story... unnecessary.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'll continue reading this story... I WILL NOT if the price stays the same because book 4 might be just the same as book 3.  Also if it takes 8 months to release.... Well then forget it.  There are way better authors writing GREAT novels for A LOT LESS MONEY.  I'm giving this book TWO STARS because I'm applauding her excellent writing style... however,  I'm so disappointed in you Sylvia Day for whatever choices you made concerning this TRILOGY!!!!!o disappointed in you Sylvia Day for whatever choices you made concerning this TRILOGY!!!!!
B006IR6NH8|5.0|Part of the reason I've always sucked at racing games is the joy of controlling the vehicles with a keyboard or a tinny POS that tried to pass as a wheel.  The controllers that clamped on the desk got in the way and were difficult if impossible to calibrate.  This wheel does neither--it sits nicely on the desk on either the holder that was part of the package or the points of the rear flaps and the front of the wheel if you were not prescient enough to keep the holder handy.  It is also infinitely calibratable.  Now if I suck it's due to not following the right lilne through the curve, pushing the engine toward the redline too far...I can't blame that on the wheel.  Good piece of equipment.  The software rocks as well, although the &#34;pay to win&#34; model kind of turns me off.  Great package overall.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|THIS IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE, LOVE DANNY DEVITO AND MATT DAMON. WILL WATCH THIS MOVIE AGAIN. IT IS THAT GOOD
B001N9ESQ4|2.0|Their reunion is even more boring than their initial encounter. Over the years, they have each become more self-absorbed and less capable of real love. She is neurotic and difficult while he is just uninteresting.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|Aj very good book about Lucretius, bookbinding, scroolsa and the renaiscance. However the title that the world became modern just because an Epicurean masterpiece was discovered is overblown. The modern world has many causes and this may a small one. The book is readable and interesting.
B001NA6096|2.0|Two self-absorbed boring people having what they think are meaningful conversations. I wish there had been more of Vienna and less of them. No thank you to this movie.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I love this movie. It really shows people how in tune our pets are to us. I don't think dogs get enough credit for what they do for us and how they really do understand us. They love us unconditionally. Richard Gere plays an excellent roll and of course the main actor Hachi is excellent. I recommend this to everyone of every age. It will teach you things you may have never known about our furry kids and how they will go out on a limb for us. How strong of a love they have for us. The writers of this movie really did an excellent job.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci is a master story teller who captured my interest from the first page.  He kept up a quick pace with lots of turns and action throughout the whole book.  I've only read a couple of his books, but each time I finish one, I feel entertained and exhausted.
B00881VLCE|1.0|After I got this app, I deleted it.  I just found it too simple to do.  If I really think about it, how hard can it be to do a puzzle on your kindle?
B002PEP4C8|4.0|I had read both of A.S.'s other books. I'm not really into bio's but I had wondered what kind of mind could come up with stories like The Lovely Bones and Almost the Moon. When I found out it was about her rape I had a bit of an idea but I was not prepared for the brutality of it. I have read many intense novels so maybe knowing this is a true story is why I was exhausted and had to take breaks in reading. It's hard to give her praise for what she went through and how she conducted herself ONLY because she doesn't seem to want it. I will say I admire her tremendously. This book could be a manual for parents, siblings, friends, male and female, on how rape effects everyone around you. It jumps around some towards the end which is why I gave it 4 stars. Get ready for myriad emotions.
B00008BLAS|4.0|This album clearly is the close of a dynamic American rock giant. Grand Funk was moving in a different direction in their latter albums as compared to their hard hitting rock achievements of the past. This does not mean they got worse. They just strayed from the GRAND FUNK I preferred. They were becoming too commercialized for my taste.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I enjoyed Hosseini's two other books so much and I learned so much about life in Afganistan.  This book was not at all like that.  It was okay but not great.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|If you like action flic's that aren't over the top with blood, you'll like this I think. After watching this movie I wanted to read the book and that pushed me into reading a lot of Clive Cusslers books. BTW, as Hollywood seems to do most ofter, this doesn't follow the book very close. I think they did a pretty good job with the characters, but the storyline isn't very close.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|This movie is an excellent version of Persuasion.  I like the director's focus on the small things that you wouldn't normally notice.  The quality of the movie is pretty good for streaming.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Jude Law is adept at acting as a psychiatrist in this twist and turns type of movie. Love the never give up attitude!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Thought it was a good movie and can't wait to see the rest of the series. I will be waiting impatiently.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I love doodle jump. They have so many themes to choose from. They have a Christmas ,arctic,2Halloween,Easter,ocean,soccer,outer space,the original,and my personal favorite the samurai!!!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Again, Hosseini has crossed ethnic, cultural, religious, language, and geographic boundaries to explore in depth the human condition.  With touching and sorrowful topics. he writes filled with hope, joy, and a love for humanity.  He is a consumate storyteller, and reminds me of Steinbeck at his finest.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|The family and I are enjoying getting caught up with the series.  Love the storyline.  Can't wait to watch Season 2!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Got this for my kids and they love and I love to watch it, great movie, good job Disney love your movies.

B00BVYNSLC|4.0|Surprisingly fun science fiction story with plenty of twists and turns. Story needs a few things to make it truly stellar: More clones and more about the genetic engineering.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it the new update came out yesterday and now I can set things on fire I highly recommend this app
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I never considered OneRepublic to be one of my favorite groups, but this album has drastically changed my opinion.  My usual favorite groups are Snow Patrol, Coldplay, and Keane.  Native, however, has propelled this group into my top five.  It is a rare occurrence that I like more than two or three songs on any given album, but I love most of the songs on Native.  If I had to isolate my favorite cuts, though, they would be: Counting Stars, Burning Bridges, I Lived, If I Lose Myself, and Life in Color.  I find myself listening to these gems more than to any other artists' songs that I have recently downloaded.  If OneRepublic continue to produce music of this caliber, they stand a very good chance of moving to the top of my list of favorite bands.  I can't wait until their next album!!!!!!

B004W1GCQO|4.0|I'm not inspired by the characters, they don't make me root for them and I started watching it and didn't finish. Frankly I forgot about it. It is a good concept and a different era then Downington Abby, but you have to have the characters in order to continue to pull that off.

B00CL151G4|5.0|TO all you sharky BBC fans of Sherlock.<br />I do concur BBC version is great. I am a fan and waiting for season 3 with great anticipation.<br />HOWEVER- this version of Shelock Holmes stands alone in it's own brilliance. And the idea of a female surgeon as WATSON is gutsy and adds a new depth to their asexual relationship (please keep it that way). This version of damaged Sherlock holds more pathos for me.<br /><br />Johnny Lee Miller was made for this version of Sherlock. Please see him in his breakout role- Trainspotting. I can not imaging Cumberbatch playing ex addict Sherlock Holmes with tatoos but somehow I think I can see Miller bing able to pull of Sherlock in the BBC version ( now I am going to be blacklisted by the cumbercollective) but it would be different from Cumberbatch's version. I am just saying I think he could pull it off.<br /><br />And those who stated elementay has similiar story line, I have noted a trend in BBC's version as well- after watching 6 episodes of BBC Sherlock - there is SHerlock going off being bored and rude ( Cumberbatch plays these moments with great charm and energy), and their stories were rehashed modern versions of Old Sherlock- there is only so much Moffat can do in order not to damage his favor author's stories. (Excellent ANDREW SCOTT KILLED Off TOO SOON.) Only other villians are Sebastian Moran and CAM :(. Irene Adler is just a footnote now. As you can tell, I enjoy the BBC version very much but it did not put me off enjoying this version- please give it a try.<br /><br />In Elementary, I am expecting different stories (post 9/11 world) and perhaps it can  fullfill my hope for a more dangerous and brillant villians. So far I have enjoyed the interaction between Miller and Liu. Stories lines were tight and had enough spark to have me watch it over and over on my Video on demand.<br /><br />I like to point out that if most British fans can live with 10-11 versions of Dr WHO- there is more than enough  room for two excellent versions of Sherlock HOlmes in this life time. ( I could not stand the recent Sherlock Movies after watching these two brillant shows).<br /><br />Personal note- I find it  interesting that both actors play Sherlock and they were both in a play called Frankenstein -Johnny Lee Miller and Benedict Cumberbatch - both actors had played same roles in alternating night. I wish I could have seen it- but given their performances of sherlock holmes I would wager Miller would have made a better monster and Cumberbatch, the Dr Frankenstein. I am fan of both - and would love to see them in a same movie. But sometimes I wonder if they are each other's  foils.
0812415086|1.0|The pages are made out of some cheap, almost newspaper-like substance. They're so flimsy, I noticed at least one page that was torn about an inch. Very disappointed, as I gave this item as a gift!
B004K00NMG|5.0|My daughter loves this movie. She watches it every night before bed. It's her new all time favorite princess movie
B009R659L8|2.0|I usually buy her books the day they come out. Her first ones were open read and don't put down till finished.This one is taking longer. Hasn't dragged me in . Its OK but not up to her others. MHC is usually a buy without reading the synopsis. The last ones are not as good. Want a great review go find the first ones she wrote Where are the children and go from there. Stay away from the ones she wrote with her daughter.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|I knew that this movie was not going to be a great piece of cinema. My intention was to simply enjoy a fun gothy movie with my daughter and I realized that many laws of nature, physics, etc. would be totally flouted in order to make the film more \\"spectacular\\". The result was less spectacular and more comical. The writing was atrocious and the acting was so bad that I half expected the actors to just bust out laughing at how silly everything was. I think the special effects were done by Gallagher! I literally spent this whole movie cracking up. This should definitely have been listed as a comedy.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Its very boring to play. If I had paid any money for it, I would be angry. No fun and its horriable
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|This is just for all the one star reviews. Maybe do some research on the product your buying. If its 3d than see if it it has the features. Don't blame Disney cause YOU don't read the description of the features.
B000002LAC|5.0|My friend said this is one of her favorite CDs of all time. It is musically very interesting, as you can hear what each artist of the &#34;Trio&#34; brings with their unique vocal tone.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This movie is hilarious. The way it jumps back and forth between viewpoints is great. \\"hey, we got your friend!\\" ... \\"ahhhhh! /runaway\\" ... \\"where are they going? Don't they want their friend back?\\"
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love her music, loved her videos, as an overall is a delight for your ears and eyes. One of the youtubers that can reach stardom easily, but wait she keeps to do work with fellows from youtube, so she will also bring other with her.
B004XVN1T4|3.0|Good read, but not quite up to the skill he demonstrates in his later efforts. Some of the errors by the players in the book were too obvious for the level of skill they otherwise had.  His later works showed Follett continued to improve his skills with each novel.
1449408656|5.0|Not a big fan of this one, but it was a gift for  a catlover, so it turned out good
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I could feel what he was describing and I felt comfortable with it until he used another name for God, never really mentioned Jesus and felt a SEER contacted him while there. All of this could have been concocted by Satin for he is the father of all lies and will give a partial truth to draw you in. Everything implied a soul could get to heaven through any spiritual means.<br /><br />I do not recommend this for Christians
1449410243|5.0|This was a gift for a cat lover/freak, she loved it. Will make you laugh no more needed to say
0061743526|5.0|I gave this book as a gift to my son in law. He is looking forward to rereading this book that he read in high school!!
1401216676|5.0|Epic story, Epic art, Epic comic. Heroes hardly ever seems this real. A must have for comic book fans / lovers
B004X6PRO6|2.0|Not a good read!!Kept reading , hoping it would  become interesting and make some sence, but to me it was just a mish-mash of<br />nothing, , and rather stupid.
0446560073|5.0|My wife has been a fan of that cat for a while, so she really enjoyed this book. Most of my coworkers thought it was a painting book hahaha that could be another purpouse I guess hahaha
B004XISI4A|5.0|it is fascinating once you read it you can't put it down and wish that it will be extended bravo
