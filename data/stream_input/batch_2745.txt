B002EMESSM|1.0|Long Long Long movie that doesn't get good until the end.  I thought we'd never make it.  Everyone was doing some other activity while watching.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|The plot is crazy as it is sane.  The acting and directing are all top notch.  I'm not sure if you could relate this to a real life experience but the movie tries, and it is a very nice time away from the world around us.  It does not take itself seriously, and I could definitely connect in some ways to what happens in the film.
B008KNUKVI|4.0|These young people are such amazing musicians and they use their voices in ingenious ways.  I often like their arrangements of covers better than the originals.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|this item is so cheap it fell apart even after i put everything together. never buying this item again. you mite as well spend more money on a good quality camera holder
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|FOR 99 CENTS THE FULL VERSION IS ONE OF THE BEST DEALS FOR ANY GAME APP.  EXCELLENT USER PLAY. LOVE IT ON MY TABLET.
B00ASMK7WG|5.0|I CAN'T RATE ANY DISNEY MOVE BAD.  THIS WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED.  LOVED THE STORY LINE AND THE PACKAGING WAS JUST LIKE THE STORE
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game every day. Everything works great and I try to beat my previous score every time I play. !!!
B003DT19F0|5.0|I loved this.  Got it before the stores had it.  Bought it as a present for my 5 year old.  Quality was exactly the same as in stores.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Haven't read it yet, but after seeing Rezlan attacked on Fox News and responding with such politeness and effectiveness, had to buy it.<br /><br />Anyone who can respond with such poise to such a blatant attack will probably write a very compelling bock on this interesting subject.
0345529057|5.0|This box set was a steal! Seriously, the first 4 books for $20 was more than I could as for. And I'm enjoying them thoroughly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the first game to me that is the best game in the world than is why I need bananas.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this gAME  TOTALLY addictive. Boyfriend bought it and I love it.  Awesome.Love the  horses. Kids love it too. Easy to play
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|First time reading this author. I could not stop turning the  pages. I recommend fir those who don't fear the dark side...but oh how it is diminished by the authors ability to weave light.  Excellent story.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I would make this purchase over in a heart beat. One of the best nail biting series there is out there.  Kindle as has the voice to text to can turn on so it can also be used in an audio book kind of setting. Awesome Purchase
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's simple, cheap, and awesome. What's not to love? Once this thing gets hbo go support, pandora, and some other third party app support it will be a home run. Love it!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This brings Batman out of the craziness of Tim Burton and into as real a world as possible. A great start to a great trilogy.
0007345321|3.0|A little slow. Kind of strange with all the religious aspects. Ending was expected - no surprise there. Just ok.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can can only use off line so I haven't enjoyed using the perks of the online usage.  But how can you give bless than five starts to Gods word.  it never goes void.
B0067AC5KA|2.0|I don't know how this became a world-wide best seller. I've only read the first book, and it took FOREVER before I became interested. I'd say it was easily 9/10ths into the book that I wanted to read it. Once I start a book, I have to finish it even if it's dry, horrible writing (as in this case). I ordered the bundle because it was supposed to be so great. I'm used to books with more action in them (like the Anita Blake novels by Laurell K. Hamilton), Now my kindle is staring at me, reminding me I've got 2 more of these wretched books to finish. On days like this I wish I wasn't so compulsive, then I wouldn't feel the need to finish what I started. I can usually read a book of this size in one or two nights. I have NO idea how long it took to read this one, it was to painful to keep track.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show was amazing. I cant wait for season 4 to come out. I jst wish they brought these seasons out sooner than 6mo. after it airs on t.v
B009NY43NY|3.0|I will not give away the ending to this book. This is not a &#34;Spoiler Alert.&#34; I just want to say the ending sucked. It was a several book build-up to NOTHING. I was very disappointed with Ms. Harris. I thought she could've done better.
1451638450|5.0|Tip of the Day: Don't start reading a new Lois McMaster Bujold book at bedtime!<br /><br />Captain Vorpatril's Alliance is Ivan's story. Even though it was published after Cryoburn, it comes before it in the timeline, according to the author. If you have not already read [[ASIN:1451637500 Cryoburn (Miles Vorkosigan Series)]], read Captain Vorpatril's Alliance first.<br /><br />Ivan finally has an adventure for which he cannot blame Miles, even though he tries. To not give away any plot points, let's just say Lady Vorpatril raised Ivan to be a gentleman, and those gentlemanly instincts lead him down a rabbit hole. A very twisty, Barrayaran rabbit hole.<br /><br />Captain Vorpatril's Alliance pulls together numerous minor story lines from previous books and provides, if not closure, then updates on those character's lives and situations. This is only one of the many reasons this book is such an enjoyable read.<br /><br />If you are not already familiar with the Vorkosigan books I recommend you start with either [[ASIN:0671578286 Cordelia's Honor (Vorkosigan Saga Omnibus: Shards of Honor / Barrayar)]], Cordelia's story omnibus and the beginning of the series, or [[ASIN:0743436164 Young Miles (Miles Vorkosigan Adventures)]], the first Miles story omnibus which includes \\"The Warrior's Apprentice\\", \\"The Mountains of Mourning\\", and \\"The Vor Game\\". While Captain Vorpatril's Alliance is a good book as a standalone, it is an exceptional book as part of the series.<br /><br />Lois McMaster Bujold is one of those writers who make me want to get to the end of the story as fast as possible and at the same time stretch the story out as long as possible.<br /><br />The first because the twists and turns of the plot are so interesting! You are never quite sure where it is going. Following the storyline is like exploring a new city by taking random roads just because they look intriguing. You can find hidden gems of places, run-of-the-mill places, or outright scary places, and you never know which it might be.<br /><br />The second because spending time in the Vorkosigan universe is like visiting old friends you don't get to see often enough, and you wish the visit didn't have to end so soon.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent book, and a reminder of why Lois McMaster Bujold is one of my favorite authors.  An absolute joy to read.ver know which it might be.<br /><br />The second because spending time in the Vorkosigan universe is like visiting old friends you don't get to see often enough, and you wish the visit didn't have to end so soon.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent book, and a reminder of why Lois McMaster Bujold is one of my favorite authors.

B009NG1Q96|3.0|It was a good follow up to book one but it tended to lag at places. Also, the love triangle between the Prince and Aspen was often a bit confusing and also tended to lag. I will be interested in what happens  in book three.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love to have my notes available in any of my devices (computer, phone, kindle.fire and ipad). I use it for everything from travel and grocery list to record ideas for work or craft projects.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is a game that Stark Industries should have created, meaning it is likely filling the bank accounts of its owners. After playing the game for 4 days @ 1.5 hrs/day, I have only unlocked 4 suits of armor. If you want to unlock more, play more or whip out your wallet, because it's going to cost you. Not only to unlock the armor, but it will cost you a *different* credit to build the armor. And then you must wait (or pay up) while it counts down the time to &quot;build&quot; it. In a way, this game makes you feel like Tony Stark, without the axle grease, elbow grease and cool car collection &hellip;dammit. Also, if you're poor (or cheap), this is the Everlasting Gobstopper of games. There's a lot of sucking (you *will* die every time), and you never seem to make any progress.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This is practically the whole truth, portrayed with some lightness, but veers to some very real darkness now and then. I didn't expect to like it so much!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love all the details.  But i think there should be no Facebook.  Cause some kids don't have facebook. The reason i did the id cause i wanted some bananas.
0061122416|5.0|Phenomenal book.  Excellent for anyone who has suffered adversity and is trying to move on, renew themselves, and live in the present.
B00BZW5W3W|4.0|I loved her voice since she started singing in 'Incognito'. I was so glad I could purchase her new single album.<br /> I liked 'Good morning Sunrise' the most which she sang with 'Bluey' (the leader of 'Incognito'). But rest of the songs did not move my heart as much as 'Good moring sunrise'. Not all the songs in the CD were satisfying. Maybe I'm more of an Acid Jazz guy rather than an R&B. Anyway it's only my personal view. I think most of Maysa's fan will love this album. I hope you people enjoy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. You are training a horse for competing. You also can buy coins and gems for you and your horse.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My kids absolutely adore this game! They spend hours on it at a time! It teaches your children the responsibility of caring for an animal without it dying in real life:)
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game.  Stress relief!  This is my favorite game.  I recommend to all my friends and family to download this game.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|It was fun to see how the friendship between the professor and Magneto started and how it fell apart. The actors are attractive, which never hurts, plus you get to listen to the professor's British accent. Some of the minor characters are not developed to their full potential, but the storyline is good.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Netflix quality was so-so, but YouTube videos look great. I was surprised that it stated that it was iOS compatible. During set up I learned that iOS compatibility is &#34;coming soon.&#34; I was still able to set it up using my web browser, though. (Luckily, it worked, as I do not have Windows 7).
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Best horror movie ive seen in years. Cannot wait to own a copy of my own. This is a film ive been waiting for.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I always enjoy Aslan's books and this was no exception. Insightful and fascinating. He brings to this subject exceptional scholarship and unique insights.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Dan Brown is getting, or has already gotten, redundant. He has talent; I just wish he'd ditch the Langdon formula.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I enjoyed the concept - it was a good giggle.  The actors were perfect for their roles.  Fun. Fun. Fun.
B005DD7KCA|3.0|This is an ok movie of fun action and small story but it is fun to watch with some great fights.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|I was able to sync the transmitter with my Jambox on the second try. It streams music consistently. Clipped securely onto my iPad Nano 5th generation.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|First heard the story on CBS' 60 Minutes.  A very moving story from Detroit. I'd tell you more, but you need to be surprised. The music is great and timeless.  It won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2013.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Watching this series back to back is like reading a great novel that you can't put down!  Can't wait for the next chapter...
0316044695|5.0|This is a thrilling and fast-moving read. It was given to me by a friend of Luttrell's--signed--I couldn't put it down for two days. The account of what Navy Seals endure, not only in training but also in their duties, reveals a desolate, danger-filled and impossibly challenging life.  Only the very few are able to succeed--or survive. These are giants of courage and every kind of strength, but the book shows they are also sensitive and patriotic American boys. We civilians owe them our gratitude and admiration.
B00000ADG2|5.0|One of the greatest albums ever made regardless of music preference.  I ordered the cd after years of not being able to find any good music.
B00684J49U|5.0|My wife dragged me into watching this TV show. I finely relented and we watched it form the start using her DVD collection. It's a well written and entertaining show.
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|Best Disney movie in years. The setting and story are fantastic. One of those rare movies you don't mind watching over and over. A dash of Tabasco and it's the bee's knees
B001BKVWYG|5.0|There are a lot of good songs on this CD.  The story behind the CD is found in In Search of Sugar Man on DVD.  The personal story of Rodriguez is remarkable.  He received an honorary Doctorate, but earned his Masters while working hard in Detroit.  His songs stay with you.  His story will amaze you.  Get both the CD and DVD.
B00CQW9TR0|3.0|I got this because David D. was in it.  Sucks he was the bad guy!  lol.  Anyway, its a decent movie.  Low budget, kind of movie.  I'll have to watch it again, but its a bit of a slow burn.  I am probably ruined by all the big action flicks nowadays.  Anyway, not a bad movie, and if you like both David D. and Ed H. you more than likely enjoy this film.
140006922X|5.0|But there seems to be a campaign by others who have not read this book to drive down the rating, by simply saying, \\"Warning!  Author is a Muslim!\\"<br /><br />I do think it possible for a Muslim to write a scholarly book about Jesus and his times.  After all, the Muslims do revere Jesus as a prophet.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is a blast to play. Many reviews have stated that it is hard to get by without pearls or purchasing items, this is wrong. I am currently on level 17 and I have not bought one thing.  This game does take patience and it seems that some of the other reviews are from impatient people. Give this game a chance and you may grow the prettiest reef out there. The only bad part of the game is the treasure chests. I wish they came more often but not at a hefty price such as 6 pearls. I just pass those by and wait for the free ones or the ones you can open with coins.
1452126577|4.0|It is a fun and cute read well worth it for fans of this unique adorable feline. Cute and fun.
B007DIQC90|5.0|From the unfamiliar, mysterious lyrics to the singers' Icelandic accents, and the wall of music that flows from this band, I really enjoy listening to them. I actually prefer the live videos on YouTube, for they bring out the characters of the individual band members, and also allow them to tinker around the edges on some songs, like when trumpeter Ragnhildur Gunnarsd&oacute;ttir alters her playing from one event to the next. The lead singers, Nanna Brynd&iacute;s Hilmarsd&oacute;ttir and Ragnar Þ&oacute;rhallsson. harmonize well together, and sing their solo parts with passion and joy. I like the fact that at certain parts of most of the songs, all of the band members sing, such as on choruses of songs. I also enjoy the many &#34;Heys!&#34; and &#34;Lalalas&#34; thrown into the mix. The CD, being a studio version, is a bit more clean and straightforward. What I mean by that is that the songs are wonderful, but seem to lack the feeling and joy apparent in the live performances. This band generally plays in a tight way, all of the instruments either supporting the others in what I think of as a wall of music coming at you, or else the guiatarists or the trumpeter weave their beautiful music in and out of the drums, acoustic guitars, and keyboards -- or sometimes, an accordion. Well done, guys and gals!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This movie is a delight to watch and the music is wonderful.  The background material on the filming of Once is worth getting the DVD to see how it was done with just $100,000.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Straight up, very good movie.  Special effects were great, Tom did a wonderful job, and the story was solid.  I could ask for two or three things to be different, or explained more, but who doesn't.  That's how most movies go.  If you like Cruise & Sci-Fi, you are likely to enjoy this movie.  I'd definitely like to see more Sci-fi like this.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|More great drama, great writing, great acting.  More fun than I would have expected for a British period piece.  We are anxious to see the next episode.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The 22 episodes of the television series The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones aren't included here!<br /><br />There's no deleted scenes either (not even the 28 seconds mentioned in big bang theory?), but deleted scenes wasn't enough for the updated haters to buy star wars so I'll just review the movies!<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark was the film that started it all! Harrison Ford plays Archaeologist Indiana Jones in search for the Ark from Bible myth! He finds out it's real! Nazies in this film are his competition!<br /><br />The Temple of Doom is a prequel set a year before Raiders of the Lost Ark! I'm surprised at how many people give negative reviews to this film! The heart removal invented the PG-13 rating! Indy looks for sacred stones with a goonie and the director's wife!<br /><br />The Last Crusade has James Bond playing his father! They look for the Holy Grail! This film has the dwarf from Lord of the Rings reprise his role from Raiders of the Lost Ark!<br /><br />Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is watchable! Karen Allen from Raiders of the Lost Ark reprises her role! Instead of looking for treasure, Indy must return a crystal skull to it's rightful place!
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|Even though my receiver was from 2010 this YBA-11 still worked great. All I had to do was make sure a power strip was in reach to plug in the power. I used the same AC power charger and USB cable my Iphone uses. I also used a USB extender to make sure the power cable reached the power strip.The newer model receivers have USB power built into the receiver. The YBA-11 device goes on automatically when I connect to through my iphone. I keep a lot of music on my iphone and this allows me to enjoy my home stereo system even more.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|How we are so interweaved, our lives from one life to the next.  This movie touched me and as violent as it is it gives me hope.  Our lives are not are own.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am a dog fan so this was a great and easy read.  Lifes ups and downs but triumphant none the less, teaches great lessons and love and a passion for winning
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|with this film.  If you like good sci-fi, you'll enjoy this.  First rate.  The negative reviews must be coming from \\"rocket scientists.\\"
159463176X|4.0|Khaled Hosseini's first two novels, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns were two of the finest books I have ever read.  And while his most recent effort, And the Mountains Echoed, is a fine piece of work, it doesn't rise to the level of his first two novels.<br /><br />Hosseini is a magnificent story teller, as demonstrated by his first two novels, and his skill can easily be seen in his most recent work as well.  However, the structure of the book, jumping back and forth in both time and story thread, result in a disjointed reading experience and detract from the overall enjoyment of the work.  As in his previous novels, much of the action centers on Afghanistan, from the late 1940s to the present day.  Unlike Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, however, large parts of the story take place in locales as diverse as Paris, California and Greece.<br /><br />Perhaps having read the previous two books, much of the novelty of Afghan history and culture has worn off, leaving only the underlying story to support the reading experience.  That is still enough to recommend the novel, yet not enough to award it the rating garnered by his previous efforts.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I always used to check the Weather channel on TV, but this is better, because the National Weather Channel no longer gives the locals on the 8s.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|As parents of a child just beginning to make a career we found this very relevant and very funny.  Good performances. An absolutely perfect ending!!
B00BHMEALA|1.0|\\"Based on a true story\\": The weasel words of Hollywood. Do a bit of research, and you find out that this movie version is virtually complete fiction. The UK and New Zealand embassies DID NOT turn the Americans away. The Bazaar episode was invented. Not only was there no chase scene when the Americans flew out, but the Iranians were entirely clueless and the departure entirely uneventful (yawn). The CIA role in reality was minor compared to the Canadian role. And a lot more. Shame on you, Ben Affleck.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|While I was able to finish the basic game in just 2 sittings, I still really enjoyed the graphics and the music.
B00AYB0YFQ|4.0|I enjoy these take offs of popular movies. The Wayans brothers did an excellent job on the first two installments.  Third movie was not done by them and you really knew it.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|The sequel is just as good as the original, if not better. Mr Cruise and his crew do a bang up job. Definitely a MUST see!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The unique names were difficult to follow for the first chapter or two, but Brandon Sanderson quickly draws you into his creation.
1401924751|3.0|First let me talk about the things I do adore. The artwork is beautiful & I adore Doreen Virtue & her work. I only give this deck 3 stars because if it's a deck for personal use they are limited since it's specific to one topic. It is however a great user friendly deck to use if you read for others & add to a variety of decks. At the time of purchase this was heavily on my mind to get guidance on, but once on path they don't have much use for me anymore personally.
B002PEP4U0|4.0|This is a remarkable true story of a boy who wanted to improve his family's life and did it!  Learned a lot about motors,  African culture and government - very interesting.
B005LAIHCW|5.0|I was able to figure out what was going to happen, but only 5 minutes before it did. The twist at the end was WAY unexpected. I love everything about this movie.  Definitely a new fave.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|The story was great. It hit home for me because of my relationship with my family. I'm also a huge mma fan and the fighting scenes were realistic.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|The continuing story of the Ghost Rider. Looks as though being a hero is a trying thing. He's tracking down the devil himself....with a vengeance.
B00AB0AXU6|1.0|My wife and I have really liked the Resident Evil movies up until this one.  There are some B-movie really cheesy effects.  The dialog and scenarios seem contrived (even for a sci-fi/horror movie based on a video game).  All action without a good story-line.  My wife thought it was like watching someone play the video game instead of watching a movie.  We ended up stopping half way through.  There is a possibility it got better, but I'm not betting on it.
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|I hope Kanye keeps up the experimental stuff. I must admit though I liked when he would find an old song and then sample it. Maybe he is tired of that? Also, I find it disturbing that just because some people give this record a bad review, black people want to come on here and claim that those reviews are done by racist white people. Get over yourself and move on. This cd is not for everyone.
B001EBWING|5.0|Well, it's the first of an All Time Classic love story. Will be remembered by generations to come as the Greatest!
1451696191|5.0|First high school project for my daughter entering high school and she loved  the story line and everything about this book...

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I need more of Gideon and Eva! QUICKLY!!!!!!! :) So glad that it is not stopping there. Thank you Sylvia.....
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Brilliant characterizations.<br /><br />But, sadly a cop-out ending to the season's closing episode.<br /><br />As the screen went dark, I couldn't help but feel the writers had run out of ideas.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|This book was interesting & captivating. I couldn't read fast enough to see how things unfold. Definitely left me pondering the choices made in life. Yet, at the same time breathless from the complete love, devotion, & selflessness of the main character. Another win from Nicholas Sparks.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I'm happy with the basic utility of this app. Perhaps later I will get deeper into features, but for now it takes notes, and that's as far as I've gone.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Got the latest update there are good and bad to the update. Good better graphics really brings out the HD in the fire better radar map much improve. The bad or needs work the interface can't up current conditions on video format on app that sections ends to be redone.

039472903X|5.0|Inspiring storytelling.<br /><br />Lovely, measured, rhythmic prose.<br /><br />We can learn much just by absorbing his non-nonsense style.<br /><br />Required reading for anyone contemplating a career in the field, or just wondering how it is done.
B006CHML4I|5.0|Light weight, comfortable and handsome.  I was surprised by the rear window where I can view time as it flys by.
0761172726|4.0|like it. Very cute. the kids like the graphics.<br />I kind of wanted something I could rip the pages out of and hang one month at a time on the fridge. If that's what you want this isn't it.<br />It's kind of heavy to hang on fridge so you need to hang elsewhere or put it on a desk or table. But practical. Stickers are cute. I'd recommend it.
B002FOAVGC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. You'll read reviews about the multiple single-shot scenes which were achieved, but the real achievement is how the camera disappears and you're drawn into the story. Very well done.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|My family loved it, is so funny but also very sad in the same time. Overall  is a good movie and we recommend to everybody. All the best.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it is very addictive so i am warning u now do NOT spend the rest of your life playing this game.
B008XJ8WE6|5.0|Our family loves watching this show together! Great songs and the performances are very good from all of the performers.

B005MLOOJA|5.0|Law, love, lust, and scandal. What's not to love about this show?  I'm just starting season 3, I've been hooked.  My friends and family have been trying to get me to watch this show forever.  I think the title just threw me off and made me think I wouldn't like it.  I wish I would have watched it sooner, I really enjoy it.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app seems to work very much like the computer or iphone version. I'm still looking for some of the features. I just need to spend more time with it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is pretty good. Once I started playing, I could not stop; I mist have been glued to my Kindle for 2 hours.  It was... Infectious. Zing!
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Not the best movie, but it was entertaining.  Like most movies the script moved away from the real world truth, but it had to do something to make audience stay until the end.
B004SIP88Y|5.0|I was in a state of limbo when this movie ended - it took me a while to get back to the present-day US environment. I've seen it twice, and will undoubtedly watch it again in a couple of years. One of my personal top 10!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it compelled me to watch the Tv series so it was that good to me and I have like 41 honesty elements
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|I tried it...and a friend try it...no success.  Followed all the directions and tips...no success.  Could have been my expectations...but I think I wasted $25.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I'm not sure why it's called &#34;full.&#34; It didn't seem to have all the features of the regular fb app. Maybe I just couldn't figure it out.
B009K0P10K|2.0|Season 2 continues with much of the same script as Season 1 and too many of the same amazing, unbelievable twists and turns in the world of the Graysons.  Too often there are unexplained gaps in the events, which are bizarre, but not credible.  Sorry, but I got tired of the repetitions.
B008XGW1CI|4.0|I'm one of the few, I guess, thirty-somethings that never read any of the Harry Potter books, nor saw any of the movies.  That being said, I didn't have those to compare it to.  I had the pleasure of just reading it for pleasure.  And it was a pleasure to read, despite the gritty subject matter.  Not everything is wizards and roses.  What I liked about it is that each of the main characters seemed to have equal time in the book.  They all had something to add to the story, and being that this takes place in a small town, I find it very true to heart.  Everyone knows everyone else's business, and that business is not always good.  I just completed it last night, and I can't stop thinking about it.<br /><br />From what the other reviewers said, the Potter fans aren't going to like this one.  I would have to imagine that this is true.  There is no \\"winner\\", no good morals or lessons to be learned.  If you like reading for reading's sake, something that is not the same as the others, then go for it!
0399160450|5.0|I am a solid Clancy fan with one personally autographed book. I have every one of his books and this one certainly does not disappoint. It was great.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a fun game.  I love the way it presents a challenge at every turn.  The puzzles are interesting.  All in all I would recommend this game for hours of fun.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Spectacular.  Not completely true to history, but enough so that everyone should see this movie.<br />The entire cast was wonderful.
B009178OQA|5.0|I don't even like sushi (perhaps if I got some from Jiro...), but his was still an excellent documentary. It gives an insight into arguably one of the greatest chefs of our time. Jiro's mindset is one of repetition and discipline as a means to perfection. It makes me long for an occupation that I could so master or that so matters as his.<br /><br />Not a problem for me, but if you don't like subtitled movies, you might want to stay away; the entire thing is subtitled from Japanese.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Rather odd. But not forgettable. Somewhat different than what I usually read. Does give the message, that we all<br />have problems. Some people worse than others.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|it was stil awesome even after watching the TV series although they really did a great job in realizing the novel.<br />Vivid and three dimensional characters.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|The minds that composed the Wizard of Oz had no where near the FX to work with, yet the endearing drama that unfolded with Judy Garland puts to shame the prequel. Character interaction seemed to be strained in Oz, a weak attempt to build the characters of this wannabe as superior to the classic. No where near as good as the Wizard of Oz. Glad I rented it instead pf buying.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Minimal advertisements throughout, lots of options for the design and ways to play, easy to use. Great free app. Fun.
B00BUT5I84|4.0|First, let me say that I am a HUGE 30STM fan, so my ratings are not completely unbiased.<br /><br />My first reaction to this album was almost identicle to the first time I listened through &#34;This is War&#34;. I listened to the first four or five songs, then popped the CD out of the player extremely diappointed. I don't know why, but it is really hard for me to adjust to the way bands evolve. The CD went back in the case for weeks before I had the courage to pull it out and give it another chance. The second time around, I listened all the way through. There are some songs that I just can't say I like (&#34;Pyres of Varanasi&#34; is not even really a song... just kinda techno music with some tribal-like vocals) I won't do a song-by-song review, but I'd say so far this is my least favorite 30STM album. I still love the band and the album is worth buying, but it is not a staple in my collection like other 30 STM albums.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Its got its issues, but the game play is fun to the point of addiction.<br />I play the free version on a Kindle Fire, and you would be hard pressed to find a game that is more fun, at any price. The game play is smooth, the interface is clean and easy to understand. Controls are simple and responsive that allow for a complexity of battle movements to be pulled by the greenest of players. Tactical players will enjoy the team play as well as the carefully thought out in-battle leveling and upgrading. It's a lot of fun for noons and seasoned warriors alike.<br /><br />So, why didn't it get 5 stars? Well, there are some annoyances, and as small as they are, it was enough for me to deduct a full star from what is otherwise a 5 star game.<br />Please keep in mind these issues may be limited to the Kindle Fire platform and that user experience may differ on other devices.<br /><br />First: Sometimes auto login doesn't work and the game forces you to go through the entire tutorial, with NO escape or &quot;quick login&quot; button.<br />Second: Sometimes upon opening the game, the server connection/loading splash screen; (a) removes all native device controls. (b) turns up the devices volume to MAX. This is particularly annoying when it is unable to connect to a server, because it completely locks you out of your device while blaring music in your face. This forces you to do a hard shutdown of the device.<br />Third: While in the &quot;Choose a Warrior&quot; screen, if a player leaves the game you get this VERY annoying info window that tells you a player has left and asks if you would like to leave as well. Problem is, you cant close this window, until it closes itself when/if it finds another player, and you cannot access the interface behind it! So you're stuck waiting to choose, and hoping nobody else leaves.<br /><br />So these are small issues, but they're extremely annoying issues and that's why a five star game gets four stars.<br /><br />Hope you've found this helpful, and I'll see you on the field.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love those type of games where you have to put all the pieces together. This is my new favorite!
B005ISQ7JM|1.0|I was looking for something educational that would help me learn how to build a web page. With my basic understanding of computers this book was more than worthless. Reading it was a total waste of time.<br /><br />So, \\"What Is HTML5?\\"
B0040I09RM|5.0|The series I have seen in a very long time. I recommend this to anyone interested in an awesome series.
B0035JLVWY|5.0|I'll never forget the first time I saw this.  I was amazed and enchanted by Norton's performance, having never seen him before.  Since that time he has continued to provide hours and hours of entertainment at the highest level.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was a good book to read! The power went out at my house so I was looking for a good book to read since there was nothing else to do, and I stumbled upon this. So interesting how they live in different time eras. Can't wait for the next book!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|when you start its easy the you go on and you go faster and faster then you die then you get stuff you need to do
B005SAP45I|4.0|It was good. First one was better, as it usually is. Will probably buy it at some point. For a little boy that loves all things cars and trucks, it went over fairly well.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|The music on this cd is sooo good.  Willie still delivers a song with feeling.  Love the choice of songs and the different quitars he uses on this cd are so good.  Good cd for relaxing or just listening.  I immediately put it in my car cd rotation as its great to listen to while driving, sitting on the veranda with a glass of wine, on my cell phone or just anytime and anywhere.
B003DES8I6|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies. i liked this one better than the first one.  i recommend watching this movie..
B004132HZS|5.0|I called in sick to work. I told all my friends I was out of town for a work seminar. I ordered in enough Chinese to last 24 hours. And I sat on my couch and watched the entire season in my jammies. Yes, I was a bad girl! And it was worth it! The extra five pounds I put on eating Chinese was worth seeing Sherlock Holmes brought back to life. Loss of money with my next paycheck is worth seeing Martin Freeman as John Watson. Wearing jammies and not showering for a day so worth the bonus features of the dvd.<br /><br />I did the exact same thing for season 2, by the way. And yes, I still have a job...lol.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|One of my favorite all time CDs in a collection of rarities and a 2 disc live concert included just make this a must buy for any Allman fan.  I was really impressed with the quality of the live recording which was made almost 40 years ago. This feels so vital and explosive; makes you feel like you are at the concert!  A tad pricey but worth the bucks.  Includes a booklet in the well done packaging.  You cannot go wrong with this collection.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|a bit of a sad book but it has a redeeming ending.  Definitely worth borrowing for free from AMazon Prime
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Ornithophobia Diffusion is the best BBT episode ever!  I &#60;3 Sheldon!  I could watch it over and over and it never gets old.
B0074AGVWK|3.0|It's always interesting to take a peek at the Irish every-day way of life and how inflexible values and beliefs infringe on the interactions between family and friends...how living through what others may think and feel impairs on our true self and the important people in our lives.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|My review title pretty much says it all: this show is well-written and well-acted, and is just a great experience all around. I very much enjoy each new episode, and this is easily one of my favorite shows. If you like British period shows, this is a must see, in my humble opinion.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Nothing says Exciting Adventure than middle aged geriatrics gunning for some final glory. The stocks of Ensure, Centrum Silver, and Icy Hot will have skyrocketed due to concrete proof that their products work by the actors in this movie. The new motto &#34;No Shame In Naps&#34; will be the battle cry for the gray headed league.<br /><br />I applaud you over the hill action star for ignoring the glass ceiling for age appropriate roles in a youth dominated society! Rock on you harbingers of talent, class, and historical movie box security!
B006HL9G10|5.0|Peaceful!!! And calming nice that you can change the sounds too,<br />Seems easy to operate and use instead of something intrusive
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in years, some say it was hard to follow, not at all, flowed like a river all you have to do is master the swimming.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|Selena has really come into her own and this album is so much fun to listen to! It has a little something for everyone. Selena has done a lot of growing up and she is experimenting with different genres and tracks on this album. Definitely something to put on to dance to or just to put you in a better mood! I love my fun girly pop music and this album is awesome!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a wonderful show.... Loved every second of it.  Cannot wait for the new season, time will drag for that. UGH
B007IWG3WC|4.0|This movie is really fun and exciting. If you're looking for an intricate plot and great acting, look elsewhere, but if you just want something to pass the time and entertain you, this is a good choice.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I think Season 2 was even better than Season 1. Mainly because I got to see Benedict's nearly nekkid body in episode 1 of Season 2. Yes, this man has a history of not being shy when it comes to getting nekkid for a role. I wonder if it's in his contract that he gets to be nekkid? With a body like that, I don't see why it isn't MANDATORY for him to do so...lol. Martin Freeman should get a nude scene as well. I expect him to hold up his honor in Season 3. I look forward to the &#34;Battle of the Hairless Chests&#34; whenever Season 3 arrives. I WILL have fresh batteries in my remote for the happy event.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This story lacks the depth of some of his other works, but is no worse for it.  Definitely recommend it for any Gaiman fans.
B00009R86L|5.0|N.J.<br /><br />Great addition to messenger bag.<br />Well made, nice leather outer with foam pad.<br />Quick delivery.<br />No concerns or complains.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|this is a great movie, I have it on DVD but I thought it would be so much better on Blue Ray and I was right
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a wonderful show.... Loved every second of it.  Cannot wait for the new season, time will drag for that. UGH
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Definitely helps me identify when there is an issue with my wifi. Also I travel alot and this helps identify which network is best to use.
0062278096|5.0|Mine is already dog eared and has many drool spots in it. I love the behind the scenes stuff in this book. Sure the full bodied nude photos of Martin and Benedict are nice and completely done in good taste, but it's the stories behind the scenes that appeal to me the most.<br /><br />I hope Mr. Adams next Sherlock Compendium will take note that full length pull out nudie posters are more of a NEEDED item and not something to put in just slap dash. Quality over quantity, remember that please, Sir.
B003VIWO9I|2.0|Not as good as his other books, I Shall Wear Midnight reminded me of the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels: a lot of what I liked in the original, but still not quite right.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great fun.  Levels get progressively harder.  Can go back and repeat to try for better score.  Good brain activity for all.
B0087IT8LO|1.0|It was a fantastic movie which my husband and I both loved in the theatre so was excited to see it again. However in the theatre it had English subtitles or dub over (can't remember) but this DVD is totally in French without any English ...so just be aware of that- we had to return it as we could not understand French!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I will admit this is a really fun game the only thing that should be changed is the chests that arrive too many of them cost pearls to open and if your like me and cant spend every second on the game and/or don't want to spend actual money for more pearls this can be a problem for the weekend tasks it gives. I wish that it would offer at least every other chest to cost sand dollars or free open instead of always costing pearls and at least give a fighting chance to get the pretty rare fish the tasks offers.<br />Other than this little complaint about the game I think its overall great I have not had any problems with it. :)
B0097PW7H8|5.0|dfinitely helps me save my battery and when it can not automatically correct an issue it helps me identify where the issue is comming from
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm looking forward to finding how Downton Abbey can possibly recover from the losses of season 3?!  I'm skeptical because the loss was so great (as in HUGE) but I will tune in to find out.  As always, Amazon prime is the best way to go with so much available to us and such great quality of digital content!  WOW!
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Less shoot-em-up than the previous two, but still an enjoyable book.  Scalzi does a good job of not doing the same thing over and over.
0553382152|5.0|This was a very interesting book.  Had another one given to me, and bought this one to read as a first book of the pair.  Very good.MN
B0049J2BSM|4.0|Good messages, extremely funny and great acting. I would recommend this movie and I would watch it again. Wonderful and funny
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Product works great. I was a little disappointed to realize that i could not scan my old 110 neg's too. I have lots of neg's from the late 60's and early 70's from my childhood. I have already discovered several pic's that I had never seen before. Lots of great memories are being rediscovered from this little gadget. It's easy to use. The only draw back to it is the slide frames. They are heavy plastic and I am affraid they are going to be scratched badly by the time I am finished with all of my neg's, hopefully not.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Now my generation has someone to call their own...a Pavarotti-like sound we can grow up with. J&C keep on singing...I look forward to the next album.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a good game to play when your bored. Its a good mind game it can also get frustrating but after a while I get the hang of it.
B00296A4F4|5.0|This is just a real fun show.  I can't believe I always passed it by on TV.  It is so nice to see young people without all the violence and junk most shows consist of now.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I liked the book but I did not love it.  It did not engage me or surprise me.  I felt like just when I was getting interested about a character the book would shift to another character and never really go back to one I was just reading about.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|But at times too violent, particularly for children. It depicted the brutality of slavery in an authentic way. It illuminated a sad period in human existence, that on some level seemed frightening. It depicted the emotional and psychological impact on all humans, regardless of race and Blacks contribution to slavery or affirmation of slavery. The severity of hatred and fear, which perpetuates the notion that one race is more superior than the other. The psychological power that one race had over the other and continues to perpetuate itself in the current times. This movie, perhaps still not close to the truth, is a good attempt to depict how events really occurred and how another race sought to regain its dignity.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The early chapters rubbed me the wrong way. I didn't like what seemed like bad caricatures of cliched villains. And there's a certain 'hokeyness' to a lot of the characters that I found cloying as well. But there were several longer chapters that pulled me in and ultimately led me to like it overall very much.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Gives much information and can be changed to analog if you desire.  You can customize for area weather and use it for an alarm clock.  Well-developed and worth the price.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|It was an interesting read but you have to be interested in the topic to stay engaged with the book as there are many repeating and recurring themes throughout.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Interesting game..cant fully rate it since it is allowing me to go to 10 doors only before stopping the game so I could rate it
1441761268|4.0|My son had to read this novel for summer reading,  We were going on a road trip for his AAU basketball team, so I purchased the audio version.  We finished the book and were surprised how much we enjoyed it.  It was a interesting story of how hard life was in the late seventeen hundreds. The narrator did an excellent job portraying the voices of the characters.  Listening to the novel was probably easier than reading it.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The movie focused on the heart issues and depicted the event in a real way to communicate how terrifying the experience must have been for the survivors. The movie showed how vulnerable we all are and how in adversity, the human spirit overcomes. The movie also depicted how life can be so odd and unpredictable: who determines who lives and who dies? Is it all really left to chance or luck or is their an order to events, a purpose to our sufferings? This movie seem to touch on all these issues. It also address the guilt that surrounds these type of traumatic events. I think this movie can also be used in an educational and therapeutic setting. I loved this movie and I would definitely watch it again. I hope that others also recognize the gift that can come through tragedy.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Excellent,Wonder is a very inspirational read. I recommend this for both young and old adults. A message that is universal for all ages.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Lots of gameplay, and an interesting unique  storyline.  This was an app worth paying for. The graphics were very good.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|The added features in this addition to the cut the rope family are interesting and challenging. I like the themes and the complexity of the new levels.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Man I really enjoyed this one. The plot twist kept me involved to what would happen at the end of the movie.
B0054SMID0|5.0|This movie really surprised me at how good it was.  If you're looking for something that has intrigued and suspense try this movie out, you will no be disappointed.
0553386794|5.0|I was not disappointed reading through the 690 pages, which indeed provided all the background details from the series.<br />It was an enjoyable experience !
B005544V6A|2.0|A nice concept, but we didn't get past the plot.  It could be a clever show, but the pilot was too transparent.  I wanted to be challenged and surprised, and was disappointed.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I had one of my granddaughters show me how this game works.  There are SO MANY choices to use and so many levels!<br />I imagine if I gave it more time, I'd find it fascinating before it got boring.<br />I chose to try it because I thought I'd have some &#34;spare time&#34; in airports to play a bit.
161655164X|5.0|i love it very much,it's one of my favorite artbook<br />i love it very much,it's one of my favorite artbook
B001C34HUS|4.0|I loved this book, it was short and presented the information in a clear way. It really got my mind churning on several topics, especially (for me) song-writing. I recommend it to any creative person.<br /><br />The concept and steps are wonderful, although it would have helped me to see more real-life examples of this process step-by-step.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|As usual, the story is about as compelling as you will find on TV.  I am disappointed in the ending, but I will continue to watch the next seasons.
B00CDY6HW6|3.0|It's just Mario vs Dounkey Kong... In bunny form.<br />If that's what you like this is the game for you.
0316017930|5.0|I just finished this book and it is my second Malcolm Gladwell book with Blink being the first one I read.  I loved Blink and I also loved Outliers.  I found it to be both interesting and easy to read.  While many reviews challenge the validity of his statistical interpretations I think the general overview is that \\"success\\" on a whole is related to many interwoven factors and attributes.  Some of these we have control over and some we do not.  It also shows that many \\"successful outliers\\"  aren't just randomly selected from the universe and abracadabra it happens. They are just \\"people\\" whose hard work has been met with great opportunity.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Great show! Definitely an honest portrayal of teen life. I would definitely recommend this show for others to watch. Great writing and excellent acting.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A whole lot of fun. If you like minions and games like subway surfer, you will definitely like this game.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We had heard of it but never took the time to watch it: it's so good!! I'm excited to think I have several more seasons to catch up with! Each episode has an interesting law case while the story of the main character's family develops. My husband and I love it!
B002LU0E26|3.0|This movie seems much better now that I have watched it again after seeing that new Man of Steel thing. It has Lex Luthor and Superman is actually doing cool things. Some of the actors are questionable but Kevin Spacey makes the movie as Lex Luthor.
140006922X|5.0|It is quite ridiculous reading some of the comments on this page, most of the \\"1 stars\\" claim to be experts in their field (they are most likely not unless they provide evidence, which I have yet to see), that Reza's muslim religion somehow doesn't qualify him to be a writer on this topic (he has 4 degress, 3 of which were centered on religious education, his wife is Christian, Jesus is the most quoted prophet in Quran...and yes, unlike the bs you will read on this thread, he is in fact one of the most respected prophets in Islamic scripture), and that he makes stuff up (almost unlimited citations and end notes citing both sides of critiques to his book demonstrate otherwise).<br /><br />This book's real ability is to characterize the person Jesus in his historical context and allows people to see the non-religious elements that really made this person a great man (Jesus, not Aslan). From my reading, it would seem to improve a Christian's faith in Jesus due to the wonderful stories of his sacrifice and dedication to humanity. The fact that so many comments were posted illustrates the uniqueness and richness of Reza's literature.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Not a great movie but not a bad movie.  A great movie to rent just to have a relaxing evening at home.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|As a computer enthusiast I've always been interested in the stories of great figures in computer history. 'Steve Jobs' gives a no holds barred look at a design genius and his huge successes mixed with his troubled personal life.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Spellbinding read, could not put it down! I enjoyed this book cover to cover, cant wait for the next one.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|I had read this was supposed to be pretty good. Instead I found it ridiculously violent with no plot and no characterization.

B008C20TDG|5.0|This book is amazing! After 4 kids I had the hardest time dropping baby weight! After reading this, I viewed food in a different way. Since my lifestyle change, I have lost over 20 lbs and gone from a size 10 to a size 2/4!!!! No more junk food! Whole foods are the best!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The author weaved this story together and has an outstanding hit.  Love it!!!!  I cant wait to read the next one.  Very entertaining.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Saw this on Netflix in one sitting. I love everything related to Jane Austen. This was a perfect blend of her novels and fantasy. A gem of a film.
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|After seeing the entire show on TV(Palladia) I had to get the CD. Very glad I did. David Gillmore is one of the finest guitarists around and he still does Pink Floyd classics to the hilt.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Didn't read the description well enough. MY bad!<br /><br />I thought it was an actual game when I downloaded.<br /><br />They kind of mixed it in with the games.<br /><br />I don't care/play  that much to get or much less read instructions to gain points.<br /><br />If I can't figure a game like this out I don't deserve to play!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I enjoyed the cd.  good quality. the cd in its entirety was great.  the artist has a good voice.  thanks
B006LSZECO|5.0|I've lost count of the people I've recommended this book to - and they've all had the same reaction.  I read her prequel also, good . . but not as good!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Great unique story line. The actors are wonderful. The zombie hero kid is really good at keeping your interested in the storyline. Just a great all around entertaining movie. I'll probably buy it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down! Omg omg omg what an amazing book. Keeps you wrapped up in it until the end.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love Diamond Dash--you have to be quick with the eyes and fingers.  It's addictive--can't stop playing.  I highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|First off this a super little device that will easily replace the built in streaming options that ship with my Vizio TV. Much nicer to use my smart phone to fling content than the clunky built in TV UI. High quality streams that start fast. I hope more apps include Chromecast support, especially Amazon VOD. This should be the thing that pushes Amazon into releasing a non-Kindle VOD player. The marketing material sadly leave off any mention of Linux, but this works perfectly fine casting URL's and tabs from Chrome on Linux. I am a bit disappointed that I have not received the promised 3 months free Netflix promo code. Google ended the promo quickly, but should at least honor it for devices purchased the first few hours of release.<br /><br />I didn't give the device 5 stars because of some performance issues when casting a full Chrome tab.

B0020BUWX2|3.0|I was expecting this book to contain more spiritual or religious elements.  It seems to be told from an agnostic point of view.  Some of the themes were interesting and thought-provoking, but most seemed to go nowhere.  I was left feeling a disappointed with the ending.  An epilogue would have been a better ending.

140006922X|1.0|\\"From the First Letter of John, KJV, Holy Bible:<br />2:21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.<br />2:22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.<br /><br />Dear Reader: you may read whatever you wish, everyone has that freedom. But please don't fall for such lies and deception.<br /><br />At the Great Judgement of God, we shall find out one day how the Lord & Savior & Creator Jesus Christ rates this book.<br /><br />Mr. Aslan's book is a complete work of fiction.  His basic theme is to try to remove Jesus Christ from the Throne of God.  And even worse, Mr. Aslan attempts to do so from a historical perspective.  He should just come out and truly say the book is a fictional tale from his deep imagination that Jesus was only a man, not the true Messiah (the Christ), the Son of God as is believed by the Christian world. . . .  It's so disappointing that Mr. Aslan's book is so warm-heartedly well-received, he's really the blind leading the blind. . . .  If Mr. Aslan is--as he claims--such a strong disciple of Jesus, then why doesn't he believe what Jesus says?<br /><br />And regardless of Mr. Aslan's faith (or lack of it), nationality, or race, lies are lies.  So, regardless of Mr. Aslan's background, I have to rate this book as pure garbage.<br /><br />If you are truly searching about God, and who Jesus really is, seeking a truthful biography about Jesus Christ, I direct you to the four gospels of KJV Holy Bible, especially the Gospel of John.  Secondarily, apart from the Holy Bible, the best biography about Jesus Christ is Desire of Ages by EG White.
B0036JU6CY|1.0|All right, so I decided to give this movie a little rental because well... Ninja's and Assassins, sounds cool right? Wrong, wrong, so wrong.<br /><br />Let's get one thing straight, this movie is very inconsistent in terms of quality, story, characterization, and everything else in between. This is what a B-movie would be like if it were given a bigger budget. So let's break down why you need to avoid this movie if you're bored wherever you are.<br /><br />1.) The beginning of the movie (after the murder of the nameless yakuza dudes) is mainly a flashback to the protagonists training days. This is normally fine, except for one problem: He's in the present having flashbacks at random! Oh there's a metal plate bobbing up and down, let me remember when my sensei yelled at me for making noise! Oh I'm going to do hand stand push ups over a bed of nails, let me remember when my fellow ninja dude beat the crap out of me in training.<br /><br />If the movie was going to put so much emphasis on the \\"origin\\" of the character, then the ENTIRE opening scene should have been done at the ninja school. Instead we're treated with random flashbacks which are paired with random training montages. What the hell is he training for? At this point of the movie he hasn't been asked to do anything nor is he really preparing for anything.<br /><br />2.) They try to make the protagonist into mr. silent but deadly hero dude. His training and grueling background would make any person into a quiet killer. Yet, this guy (in the present) throws out some light hearted jokes as if he's a nice guy. His jokes are very inconsistent with the dark background they've given him and they feel out of place.<br /><br />3.) The blood and gore is over the top. We're talking heads splitting in half, legs chopped off, torso cut in two, this movie has gratuitous blood to the most obnoxious level. First off, the effects look super fake, and the blood seems to serve no purpose than to just be bloody for the sake of it. At least when I watch Robocop and see dudes get blown to bits, I see a purpose behind it. Not so in Ninja Assassin, though if you're a fan of over the top fake looking blood. By all means, knock yourself out.<br /><br />4.) Why are the ninjas killing people anyway? There's no point!<br /><br />Let me repeat, there is NO POINT to this movie! It's ninja porn plain and simple and it's badly executed (which is ironic considering the names attached to this film). It's a mindless action movie that sets out to have one dude fighting and killing ninjas. That's it, there's no dramatic plot twist, there's no deep meanings or themes, and in all honesty. The action scenes aren't even that great.<br /><br />Sure there's some redeeming qualities to the film. The final fight with the sensei was like watching a video game boss battle, and the ninjas using the shadows to teleport was pretty cool. But all these scenes could most likely be viewed on youtube and there's absolutely no sense in you spending 1.99 to rent this movie.<br /><br />If you want to see a GOOD mindless action movie. Watch Dredd or The Raid.it. At least when I watch Robocop and see dudes get blown to bits, I see a purpose behind it. Not so in Ninja Assassin, though if you're a fan of over the top fake looking blood. By all means, knock yourself out.<br /><br />4.) Why are the ninjas killing people anyway?

B000W4D94I|5.0|Thought the movie was thought-provoking. Really enjoyed it. Guess you had to be there. Brand new as promised, no blips, for which I'm grateful for. Excellent. Thanks Amazon.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|These guys have always been a huge favorite of mine. I would consider myself part of the Eschelon for sure.<br /><br />This album is very creative and I love that Jared and the boys are always challenging themselves to come up with something new and unique.<br /><br />I think it is quite a showing that they keep releasing amazing album after amazing album.<br /><br />Keep up the great work!!!!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, and it was worth reading! No interest on seeing the movie S there is no way Tom Cruise could fill the role as well as it was written.
B000OJFV4C|1.0|I only watched one episode. It had too much nudity and sex in it. The story line was good but didn't enjoy the rest.
B003U51D58|5.0|I thought the characters were amazing. You go so involved in them and always wanted to know more. A unique show
B000V1Z8KK|3.0|The Shooter is one of those films that has greatness tucked away inside of it, but is really not executed to the best of the director's abilities. For starters, I'm actually a fan of some of Antoine Fuqua's work.<br /><br />I mean Training Day and Tears of the Sun are some of my favorite movies, but Shooter is just really dull. Which is a shame, because it actually has a very strong political commentary. It takes everything you hate about politics, politicians, corruption, and has a sniper put a bullet in each of their heads.<br /><br />The concept is great, but the movie is boring, even if you're a fan of military style dudes carrying out operations. The main problem is that Mark Wahlberg makes Bob Lee Swagger (who thought of that name?) Into a really boring character. He has no personality whatsoever.<br /><br />*Spoilers* They kill his dog off camera and he doesn't even cry! *End spoilers*<br /><br />I understand that he's supposed to be a hardened task force recon Sniper, but even a die hard soldier is going to get a little upset that his dog was killed. The romantic sub plot with his ex best friends wife felt forced and was actually kind of creepy. Would you date your best friends wife after he dies? (This happens at the beginning of the movie, not really a spoiler.)<br /><br />There's definitely plenty of shooting going on in the movie and usage of the sniper rifle, but it just feels so formulaic. Also, what was the deal with Danny Glover's lisp? That made no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />Overall here's a little check list to help you decide if you should watch the movie:<br /><br />1.) Do you like Mark Wahlberg?<br />2.) Do you like sharpshooter tactics?<br />3.) Do you like politicians getting their just desserts?<br /><br />If you answered yes to all 3 of these, you're in. If you hit no, on anyone of these,<br />do yourself a favor and watch something else.
B002WY65UQ|5.0|That is true...the movie came and went from US theatres in a flash, or it didn't enter at all, and went straight to DVD in the US, which made me happy, as it's the only US release Girls Aloud are on...best girlgroup EVER, in my humble opinion...as well as Paloma Faith, the theatrical Brit soul/pop siren who's profile is rising in the US on her 2nd album \\"Fall Into Grace\\" on Epic...she's also an actress and plays Goth Andrea in the film.<br /><br />BUT, the film itself is an enjoyably silly, very English comedy...not an Oscar-caliber film by any means, but it's a fun film that may surprise you how enjoyable you may find it to be...I like the concept of an all-girl school populated by outcasts and a headmistress in drag, who fight to save their home/school when it's bankrupt and the government tries to shut em down...cuz where else are they gonna go??  The teachers are also inept, so same with them...who else would hire em??  I love the funny rapport between Rupert Everett (as Camilla, too funny but believable actually) and Colin Firth as Geoffrey...as well as Rupert as Camilla's swindler brother...another fun role/surprise is Russell Brand as bootlegger Flash Harry who teaches \\"crime\\"...love how Paloma's Andrea freaks even him out with her over the top ideas...\\"cut off 'er ear\\"...and it's fun how they get Russell/Flash to play the role of a gay German art dealer to swindle Camilla's brother...lots of little plots adding up to the big plot.  I did feel bad about the dog though.  And Camilla's/Geoffrey's um, DUET, on John Paul Young's \\"Love Is In The Air\\" is just hilarious and fun.  Lastly, Girls Aloud's performance of the \\"St Trinian's Theme\\" rocks.<br /><br />Now, I need to see \\"St Trinian's 2: The Legend Of Fritton's Gold\\"...I see it affordably priced now...not only to see further adventures in the school and Camilla/Geoffrey, but Girls Aloud's Sarah Harding (the blonde) has a role in the film...she is an aspiring actress...wanna see how she is...AND I want to see the early films too.<br /><br />Very glad I have this DVD...as English comedy, you cannot go wrong with their distinctive brand of dry, droll, sublime silliness really...it may be an acquired taste for some but it's a timeless, wonderful tradition.he early films too.<br /><br />Very glad I have this DVD...as English comedy, you cannot go wrong with their distinctive brand of dry, droll, sublime silliness really...it may be an acquired taste for some but it's a timeless, wonderful tradition.

B005PK57IK|4.0|I was a fan of The Good Wife years ago but didn't have time to catch it all due to school and work. When I found out Amazon added seasons 1-3 to prime, I was really excited. Now my wife is an even bigger fan. We just purchased season 4. I hope it's just as good. Great show.
B004W1GCQO|1.0|I started to watch the first episode but could not get interested in it enough to keep watching. Have been spoiled by Downton Abbey!

B002VRNR1Y|5.0|Despite it being an older movie, it was perfectly scary yet fun to watch. The movie does not even get close to being predictable.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Perfect in quality and price for my 12 year old son who is rough with his phone cases and he is happy with it.

B005HEFB6M|4.0|Shows the geocentrism of Earth, through the distrust of the Vulcans. Archer's &#34;Space Cowboy&#34; character is great!  I Like It!

B003L20IHE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It shows committment and dedication and most of all love and decision making regarding love.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|very good movie. Couldn't find it at redbox and then someone told me i could rent it off of amazon.  Never did this before and I'm glad I did.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the best horse games I have ever played. I can't believe it's free, although spending money does make it go by faster you don't need it.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|If you like super heroes, action, and funny (sometimes cheesy) one liners, this is an awesome movie! a must see.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I came to the party late, all three season were done when I started buying seasons.  Well done acting, set design, never a dull moment!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Love the story, love the author style of writing, I recommend the read, takes me away but a good escape.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I love this movie and have it in in several forms.  I happened to catch it on TV and decided that it was a must have for my collections
1400032717|5.0|I had to order this book for my &#34;Intro to Exceptional Child&#34; class for this semester. I ordered it early, and I have already read it! It is told from a teen with Aspergers point of view. Very well written.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Any fan of FF7 doesn't need me to say anything, we all know how epic and grand of a movie this is. And to those who have never played the game, it will leave you asking a few questions because of the huge story that happened in the game that it doesn't cover in the movie.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. While I didn't appreciate the crude language or all the anti-religious jabs inserted unnecessarily throughout the text, it was a great tribute to all the great 80s culture I remember from my childhood.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|The game has a backdrop that's kind of stolen from Myst but the puzzles are fun anyway.  It has a mixture of escape the room puzzles and other puzzles such as traffic jam, Hanoi towers, dots, memory matching, jigsaw, tangrams, etc.  I have not had any issues with force closing nor with lost progress.  The only time it may lose progress is within a particular game but these mini games generally take less than 3min so it didn't bother me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have throughly enjoyed this DVD.  The series was recommended to me by a friend, and I must say I am so glad to be able to watch it on my Kindle Fire.

Being an Indian I have not come across any indian author  who have expressed his/her exe the way the author has.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It is one of the best books I have read this year, and my friends to whom I have recommended it, have loved it, too.  A great read!
1934030198|5.0|I widh I had this book much earlier in the season or even last year before I run my first Tri. It would have been helpful in my injury recovery & prevention of reinjury.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Really great book - interesting and complex story expertly woven together.  And the writing was excellent throughout.  Was sad that I read it so quickly . . . . wanted more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I always like good escape games and this is no exception. It has given me many hours of fun. It is very addictive. I highly recommend it for those who like puzzle games that make them think a little. This app is challenging without being so hard you can't complete it. Good job to the developers.
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|Liberal drivel! When will people realize that the planet has been in constant change since its very inception. The presence of mankind is no more than a pimple on the butt of an Elephant. Our presence is insignificant to the forces of nature. I donated this garbage to the local land fill.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|Fun puzzles, easy to follow, helpful hints. Would recommend this game to people who like puzzle solving games. Good game
0743233832|5.0|This book was not meant for people to read but even still I feel like there is so much that one can pick and choose to learn from it. Not all of it is golden advice or a good way of thinking but some of it truly is life changing if you are open to different ideas on how to live life. I for one felt like this book was just meant for me as I could relate to a lot of the ideas. If you have an open mind then this book is worth a read if only just to expose yourself to different ideas.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What sets the Chromecast apart from the rest of the media streaming devices is the convenience.<br /><br />The implementation in Chromecast is not new. Casting to the screen can be done on PS3 and most recently on the Xbox 360 (both through the YouTube app).<br /><br />The difference with Chromecast is the ease off app switching. While on my PS3 or Xbox (or frankly any other dedicated streaming device), if I was watching YouTube and I started getting bored and wanted to see what was on Netflix, I would have to close the YouTube application and open the Netflix app, then surf around with the controller. The experience was just slow and cumbersome. Sometimes I would just watch something I didn't really want to watch because it just took too long to surf the interface and I would give up and choose something I recently watched.<br /><br />With the Chromecast, I can queue as many YouTube videos on the YouTube phone app and the Chromecast will continue playing the next video on the list. While the videos play, I can switch to my Netflix app on my phone and browse a video that I want to watch.<br /><br />The best part is I don't have to close any app on the Chromecast and open another one. If I'm watching a YouTube video and I hit play on my phones Netflix app, the Chromecast automatically switches to the Netflix app and starts playing the video.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that there is no ui on the Chromecast. There is no interface, and you don't have to use a controller or a remote, and slide one by one on the movie selections. You use your phone, tablet, or computer to find the content. These devices are better suited to find content as they are fast and have better manipulation of their interface (using touch screen or mouse and keyboard vs. A controller or remote)<br /><br />At the moment, there is a limited selection of apps that support streaming through Chromecast, however I believe developer support will be high on this device. It is the perfect bridge to get app contents on the home entertainment, without putting a lot of money and effort on different devices (Roku, TiVo, PS3, etc)
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|easy to learn..but takes time to excel......very fun way to spend time as you wait at the DMV, Doctor, etc...!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This version of Mahjong has a lot of layouts, and the characters on the tiles are easy to differentiate - unlike some versions I've tried where several different tiles look the same to me.
B001AQO3XS|5.0|One of my favorite action movies in the original (theater and VHS) release.  I never watched it on DVD, so can't comment on that, but this BD version is worth the money for any fan. The quality is up to par and the additional scenes answer questions that always bothered me but I couldn't quite express.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I loved this book at first I judged the book by its cover. When I started reading this I was like in my own world pretending to be Jonas. This one of the best books I have ever read. Thank you Lois Lowry for sharing this brilliant and creative story.
B003ZKJ3UA|1.0|i received the records and they were badly warped. one had a very bad warp and the needle skipped when played
B004SIP7AS|5.0|She was so busy trying to match-up several people she knew, she never realized how important her friend was to her...until she almost lost him.
B005544V6A|5.0|Love legal dramas and this one is one of the best.  The premise for the story line may be a bit far-fetched, but it works!  The cast is excellent and the writing is top rate.  I can't wait for each episode - it's always a delight!  Definitely a top rate show!
0062014536|5.0|Had been told by my 20 y/o daughter the \\"chat\\" was Lauren had been told her book series was going to become a movie or TV series so she left the ending hanging by too many loose threads. All I can say is this was a constant page turner, as is the case with each one of her books!! Anyway, isn't the point of a being a truly great writer one who leaves her readers - all of us - always craving so much more :))
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This movie has trully captured the charm of the The wizard of Oz.<br />My Niece and I both enjoyed it
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Season 1 set a very high bar. Season 2 is good but I think season 1 set an almost unobtainable bar to be beat. I highly recommend watching it though.
0439023483|5.0|I loved this book right away because it moved quickly and didn't linger to describe the exact color of some cute boys' eyes.  Seriously, is it event that important?  The plot moved along quickly.  The love triangle, while it existed mostly in books two and three, didn't take the front-stage-center of the story and was often used to make observations and statements about the personalities of the characters.<br /><br />The other great thing that I loved was the throwback to the Greek myth of the king that demanded children to enter the labyrinth of the minotaur.  Of course there's no victor in the myth and no minotaur in the book, but the small hints of the myths are there.  In the later books they have blatantly Greek names
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|It wasn't until the end of the story that I realized who had been a friend to the out-of-town girl.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I loved the first season and definitely was looking forward to this season.  It didn't disappoint!  More detail to the interworking of<br />the law firm and back-biting going on there than with the cases but it was so well done.  The show is so perfectly cast and the<br />actors are superb.  Can't wait for season 3!
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|Truly one if my favourite movies of all times.  Storytelling with almost no dialog is brilliant, and has a  message  about our over-indulgent and wasteful culture  that doesn't overshadow its charming story and  heart-wrenching protagonist.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Absolutely stunning with superb acting. Not for youngsters under the age of 13. Extreme graphic situations bordering on gore and nihilsm
B006M4F67A|5.0|Perfect diversion.  Having the unusable tiles &#34;grey out&#34; is a huge help on a screen.  My 5 year old can play this one.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|A beautiful adaptation of one of Jane Austen's novels.  While the Gwenyth Paltrow version is short and fun, I love that this follows the novel and shows all the little things a miniseries can show that a feature film cannot.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Enjoyed the characters in Hobbit and learned where some of the items in parts of Lord of the Rings came from.
0307341577|4.0|A great read that kept me guessing until the end.  Would have never thought the book could have ended like it did.  A must read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Who doesn't like minions?! Its a cool game for all ages! My kids cannot put it down! I am glad it is a free app! Graphics are great as well!
B0081336FO|5.0|Love the plot twists and creativity.  I am officially hooked even though a few scenes are a little cheesy for my taste!  Looking forward to season 3!
140006922X|5.0|Any book that can provoke as much controversy as this book has is a \\"must read\\".  Look at the star ratings and you can tell that there is something in this book that a specific group of people don't want you to read.  Could this be another type of zealot on the war path?!?
B009WUAK2M|1.0|After the first \\"movie\\", I had high hopes that there wouldn't be a sequel. Stallone and company proved me wrong with this second in a potential trilogy of self-indulgent, pyrotechnics-heavy, physics-defying stunt filled, 80's throwbacks. Of course, they've ignored the best of the 80's to focus on taking the most overused gags. The soundtrack seems to consist entirely of different gun noises. The Expendables 2 is so lacking in anything that could warrant a viewing, I suspect it is just a sophisticated bad one-liner delivery system. In fact, the combination of bad acting, fast pace and missing plot makes this more akin to watching somebody play a video game, and a cheap one at that. The only thing changed from the original is the body count- it actually managed to exceed its predecessor. The next major victory of Expendables 2 is the fact that it beat Twilight in the amount of poor, wooden, Razzie-worthy performances put on one reel of film. Judging by this stellar decrease in every area, I expect the third one to be physically damaging to my eyes. Please, avoid every film with the word Expendables in the title.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|Ridley Scott is a master filmmaker as far as look, feel and sound go, but I typically find myself sort of detached from his adventure epics (e.g. \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" and \\"1492: Conquest of Paradise\\"). Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them, but the storytelling keeps me at a distance. Since he's not a writer, maybe it's the screenwriter's fault, who knows? Anyway, \\"Robin Hood\\" (2010) struck me the same way, but not as much.<br /><br />The film focuses on how Robin of Locksley became Robin the hood. You could say it's a prequel to other film versions of the character. What's strange about this being a prequel is that Robin (Russell Crowe) is clearly in his mid-40s, which means he doesn't even become Robin Hood until his mid-to-late 40s. Cate Blanchett who plays Maid Marion was 40 during filming, not a spring chicken either. I have no problem with an older Robin Hood, but don't expect him to have the acrobatic daring-do of, say, Errol Flynn's depiction (who was only 28 when the classic \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" was shot).<br /><br />In any case, \\"Robin Hood\\" strikes me as the most realistic version of the character and his medieval setting. Kevin Costner's version from 1991 was realistic too, but Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham gave the film a campy edge (albeit entertaining) and there was some eye-rolling witchcraft dabblings as well (not that some people didn't practice witchcraft back then, but it just came off kind of cartooney). Both of these versions are in contrast to Errol Flynn's approach to the character, who displayed a blatant joie de vivre (\\"joy of living\\") and superhuman heroics. I enjoy all three takes.<br /><br />The film was shot in England & Wales and runs 141 minutes (theatrical cut) and 156 minutes (director's cut). The DVD has both versions and I viewed the latter.<br /><br />GRADE: B
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|Whoever wrote the script should have read the comics.  It could have been good...instead it sucked.  The Rock is a good actor, but his dialogue in this movie was weak.  This trend of changing established storylines in movies in an effort to draw a younger crowd or something just doesn't work.  GIJoe has a following, and it's Gen X not Y.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|This is a really quality album.  I was thoroughly impressed; even though he is an American Idol guy ... this album is very mature sounding!
B008QE9VJI|5.0|The Blu-Ray works really well, amazing resolution.  Great story line and Johnney Depp always  always provides the best caricatures of all.
0375869026|5.0|This book is about a child who has been home schooled for his whole life. Why? This is because he has a deformed face and afraid<br />for any strangers to see his face. But before his 5th grade year he is told that he can go to middle school. I thought it was really cool<br />that that they had different parts from different people points of view. It gets really sad at parts but at the end you'll be really happy!!
0061124958|5.0|A true classic.  My 4 year old loved it.  We read the book and then watched the movie and saw the play.  Great memories!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It's at a great price. Watch all the movies and they seem good. I love the fact that they come in one box so I don't have a bulky box or 8 DVDs boxes. Fast shipping.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The books were great until the stories got so stretched they are now boring!!! very disappointed,  to much money and the story is very very boring now!!!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Absolutely incredible movie.  My husband and I watched it several times already, just to see if we can pick out something new each time.
0425263908|4.0|When I began reading this series I could not help but to compare it to 50 Shades. However, after about a third of the way through I finally was able to stop making comparisons and enjoy the book as it is. Needless to say I bought the next two books and can't wait for the next installment!
B000031EGV|5.0|ANOTHER MOVIE THAT WE SAW ON THE TV.  IMMEDIATELY ORDERED IT FOR OUR GRANDSON AND HE REALLY LIKES IT. ROBIN WILLIAMS IS GREAT !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 6 year old son loves this game.  The graphics are very cute - way better than other movie games we've purchased.  It works - not glitchy, so we are very happy with this one!
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|This a first person narrative . Quirky characters, two young teens chidren  of an unfortunate marriage are drawn into their parents' strange plan for improving the family's situation. I found it boring and depressing but kept on to the end hoping it would get better.
B000FC13E0|4.0|I've never read a Michael Crichton novel before, and now I'm a little concerned as to what I might be missing out on. This book was absolutely fantastic, and I'm so glad it was recommended to me. I loved how the real science was blended with fiction - it made everything seem so much scarier because it might actually be able to happen. Nanoparticles can be kind of scary anyway, but to have a swarm of them become self-aware is terrifying. After taking a class on nanotechnology, it was also really interesting to see the field in its earlier stages even though it was presented in a work of fiction.<br /><br />Although the book picked up about 1/4 of the way through, the beginning seemed a little slow. Yes, it was necessary background, but I had a little bit of a hard time getting past all of the family issues and such before coming to the meat of the story. It was interesting and well written, but it just didn't seem like it was important (at first). I do think it made the story more feel real though - all of the characters are flawed in some way or another, and nobody is perfect or makes the best decisions.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed how subtle details from earlier in the book came into play later on, once we start to learn about the swarms. Not everything is as it seems, and it makes for a more thrilling read. At least in my humble opinion. And then you have the swarms themselves. Those things are freaking scary, and it's amazing to me how Crichton is able to take something that is just a bunch of tiny robots and turn it into a crazy predator that hunts pretty much everything that moves. And then, even when the story starts to get weird, it's still pretty crazy and I could totally see it happening.<br /><br />I will definitely be checking out more of Crichton's books - I'll probably hunt down Jurassic Park next. This book has some pretty strong language in it, so I wouldn't recommend it to young kids or anyone who is easily offended, but I would definitely recommend this to any fans of fiction backed by real science, suspense, thrillers, and all those sorts of books. I would give this book a 4/5.mend this to any fans of fiction backed by real science, suspense, thrillers, and all those sorts of books. I would give this book a 4/5.
B00AC4EZT6|5.0|Love Phillip Phillips music. Limited Edition has a lot of cool extras. I you like his music this is the one to get.
0425263916|4.0|At this point I was attached to the characters and wanting more. Day did a great job keeping the plot interesting so that the reader can't put the book down. Her language regarding certain body parts is the only reason I would not give this series 5 stars.
1579126235|5.0|Of the more than seventy books written by Agatha Christie, Murder on the Orient Express is probably the best know.  As has been pointed out, even people who have never read one word of one of her books know of this one.  I suppose the movies made from this work have something to do with this and also the almost universal mystique of this particular train route.  Hey, even James Bond haunted its coaches.<br /><br />It is said that this was one of the author's personal favorites (She too was stranded on it much like the characters in the story), and I must confess it is one of my top ten or five favorites also.  I like the story and I like the characters.  I also must confess that in the very early 1960s I too rode on portions of this famous route - out of Istanbul and while the train was far from its opulent glory days, it was still exciting, especially for a young man like myself with an overly active imagination.<br /><br />A rich and as we find, a very unlikeable and nasty American is murdered on one of the sleeping cars when the train is stranded in a snow drift deep in the Balkans.  He has been stabbed to death with multiple wounds.  Of course the car is locked from the inside and of course not one passenger or employee has seen a thing or knows a thing.  This includes the brilliant little detective, Hercule Poirot who is also a passenger on the train.  Who killed the man?  Why was the man killed?  M. Poirot has no communications with the outside and must solve the mystery via pure logic and a vast knowledge of human nature.<br /><br />For me the most interesting aspect of this book was that at the conclusion; after the dust had settled, Poirot presents us with two different versions of the murder.  Both of these versions are possible, both quite logical and both iron clad...even though thee differ greatly as to who-done-it and why.  This is Christie at her best.  There are puzzles within puzzles and she throws in enough red herrings to lead the most careful reader down wrong paths and cause the reader to do some heavy thinking.  Now as I have stated before, I admit to not being pebble on the beach so perhaps others can figure this one out before the surprise ending...I must admit that I could not.<br /><br />This one, for me, was a thoroughly enjoyable read.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksder down wrong paths and cause the reader to do some heavy thinking.

B009WO7NQO|4.0|It's really lame that kindle owners have to pay for this app when I have it on my android phone for free.  Other than that, it's a good game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice graphics and realistic movement. Fun and realistic activities. Great interactive app for kids. Lots of ways to earn coins with patience.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Great use of percussion, can rival John P. Sousa with regard to marches. Ryan has great range but seems like he choose to use auto-tune on one of more tracks. Great melodies, catchy phrasing but too many references to death. Love the collection and each time I listen I like the songs more and more. Nice use of electronic instrumentation (The Beatles used melatron which became synthesizer which became a cliche) but it is nice to hear songs produced with thought behind the instruments rather than just trying to add something because you can.<br />Over all the album has wonderful lyrics, harmonies and vocals. The percussion tend to make the songs sound like Marches rather than pop songs but contrarily the percussion give great energy to the songs.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Even better than the first installment, this goes into the depths of the crazy crap that can happen. It has many of the same characters from the first season (re-embodied into new characters). There are a TON of things going on and it covers just about all the horror and sci-fi that it can. The group hall song will drive you crazy.
0425263924|4.0|I bought all three books to this series at once. I was so upset when I finished this book because I need to know what's going to happen to Eva and her roommate and all of the other chaos happening in the book. Day does a great job keeping the reader wanting more.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Loved this movie. Thought Sandra Bullock was great and I enjoyed how accurate to real life the movie was- had to look up the real story after watching and was pleased most is true with a little theatrical license.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I just adore the little minion characters, so I thought adding this app would be fun to play in the car on long trips.<br />Little did we know, less than 1 minute into the game, you have to BUY tokens to continue.  This APP is NOT FREE.<br />Parents watch your kids, because they can rack up a huge bill in minutes.
140006922X|5.0|Insightful, well researched, and an interesting read.  Engaging and well-written, this is a topic that typically doesn't interest me deeply but I finished it in two sittings.  Definitely recommend.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|Does not highlight though it is supposed to be able to. Also when I zoom view it just closes and goes to main menu instead of zooming! I need a refund ergh
B005T87QCI|4.0|This app is very fun has all the great robots but wish you could rip off arms like the xbox version of real steal .
B00C061HZY|5.0|I've been a fan since 1997. Not about to stop now.<br /><br />The new album brought on several legends and new faces to collaborate in a new collection of classics.<br />RAM takes you back to the more humanized days of disco house.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Best show out there, in my opinion.  A show where you find yourself questioning whether the characters are the good guys or the bad guys, but you root for them anyway.  :)
1423136802|5.0|Was a birthday gift for my son.<br />He loved and is still thoroughly enjoying the series.<br />Recommended for all adventure lovers.
B000AXWV40|4.0|Bought this CD because of Mavis Staples' cover of &#34;Can you get to that&#34; and like the original just as much - the first song is one long guitargasm and really cool, but rest of CD doesn't really hang together that well. It has always seemed like the P part of the P-Funk sound held together better - probably the Fundadelic part was better live!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Chaaaaarrrrrge world war 2 is underway in 2013. Well sort of, now that I have this game. This awesome game.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|The game is stupid and hardly even works and is sometimes very very slow. Doesn't do what I want it to do
1490313370|5.0|Excellent read and the author is well versed in what he writes.  Very timely and honest. I would recommend it to anybody. I sent copies to my grandchildren.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer has a very good plot, various twists and turns that aren't anticipated, but has very little action.  Nevertheless, it was a great read with intrigue in the Grisham style which always captivates!
1476733953|3.0|A nice thick book, with a unique plot and interesting characters, that approaches--but doesn't quite enter--the science fiction genre.  Yes, it does take place several hundred years from now, but avoids such overdone themes as vampires, supernatural powers, outer space or time travel, etc.  The first two-thirds of this longish novel move rather rapidly. Events flow forward with no attempt to drag out the mysteries that emerge.  The last third, however, gets a bit bogged down in technology--telling you everything you never wanted to know about gaskets, servers, schematics, pumps, pipes, wires, and the like.  Putting everything together, I would give this one a 3 1/2 star rating and recommend it as pretty good bet to take along to the beach.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|When I read this book I found myself so interested in the book thief's story. The author makes words and sentences dig thir way into your heart and soul. Do not get surprised when you find yourself rereading paragraphs of this book so every word lies imprinted in your memory. I gave it five stars and will surely  visit The Book Thief in times to come.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Pure Archer!  Loads of great images, plot moves quickly with some surprising twists and turns.  I found it to be a very entertaining and quick read.  Recommended!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love this game, but I was quite upset when I has to uninstall it and reinstall it because it froze.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|It's crazy slow, which is fine some of the time... but with an option to add quick mode for a small fee. Lame. The game needs to operate at both speeds so that you can give the commands that you need to but then watch them play out. Not much fun.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Honestly, my expectations of this book weren't terribly high.  Lucky for me, it turned out to be a book that I was really sorry to see end.  The premise of the book, based on the real life orphan trains, was a subject I knew nothing about before encountering this book.  I found the book well written and the subject matter fascinating.
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|ONLY PLAY IT 1 TIME ,THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM KANYE,IT SAD,CANT UNDERSTANDN WHERE HE COMMING FROM,I WANT BUY ANOTHER ALBUM UNLESS I HEAR IT 4TIMES!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game for all ages!! Lots of fun. I enjoy completing missions before my friends and competing in the weekly challenges.
B000NYT1M6|1.0|I was so, so, sorry to have ordered this truck.  Pieces started falling off within days of receiving it.  I paid a lot of money for a piece of junk.  I am very disappointed in this purchase.
B005U9QJY2|5.0|The Dark Crystal is just J. Henson showing off his puppeteer skills. Sure there's some beautiful imagery and definitive archetypes, but the stiff mouths and sometimes unsettling imagery is probably going to scare some small children.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I feel like a lot of women can find something to love about this book. It's definitely a must read. But I don't think most guys would be able to read it.
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|As a true blue Jane Austin fan, I can hardly be disappointed. However, this is not the best version of this particular story that I have encountered. Unfortunately, the others are not freely available on Prime, so I am grateful for what I can access. I think of Jane's characters as being more subtle than these representations would reflect. In fact, for me, the power of Jane is her ability to write characters who almost seem okay, but upon deeper reflection, their character flaws become more obvious. It isn't that the actors weren't good enough; I think here my concern is about the lack of sensitivity in the direction. The storytelling has a clownishness that is not present in Jane's story. Quite the opposite. Jane has a finely developed sense of humor and displays it in her stories subtly and appropriately. This film version makes her characters seem foolish. Sorry, not my favorite.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Really liked the movie. Only problem I had  was with the setting. It looked liked an American forest instead of a jungle in Vietnam.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are many words to describe this children's story, and having read it at the young age of twenty four, the only way that I can describe it is that I loved it.<br /><br />I absolutely loved how watching Hazel fall in love with Augustus.  I loved watching how she transitioned from pre-cancer friends to post-cancer friends and how this new group of rag-tag survivors shaped her life throughout the book.  This story of young love overcoming adversity sets a new standard for the &#34;Coming of Age&#34; genre as a whole.  As you can expect from most Coming of Age stories, the Hazel with whom we're introduced is not the Hazel that we're left with; but what readers aren't expecting is that they aren't the same at the end of the story either.<br /><br />It's cliche as hell, I know; but this book is one of the best short novels that I've read in a long while, and arguably the singular best Young Adult novel that I've read to date.
140006922X|5.0|There's a stark difference in the books written about Jesus by a person who just reads the bible, and one who is an actual scholar on the subject.<br /><br />Dr. Aslan's look at Jesus of Nazareth, and placing him into the world of the time he lived allows the reader to benefit from his years of research on the subject, and to gain a better understanding of one of the most influential and controversial figures in human history.<br /><br />Highly recommended, even if I personally do not agree with some of the suppositions and conclusions.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Loved the story and special effects.  Highly recommended for fans of the Wizard of Oz.  Sam Raimi needs more movies.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Although I also enjoyed the 25th year Albert Hall film of the play, the Gerard Butler/Emmy Rossum film version of the story is my particular favorite. Both are worth seeing. The highlights of the play version are extraordinary scene craft and music and the 'live' performance aspects. However the film version offers more of the backstory and provides a rich historical aspect that, for me, is equally compelling and more satisfying. The characters seem more alive, more real. And the masqued ball scene is truly spectacular. The music, of course, is amazing. But the biggest surprise and a major delight is the Butler/Rossum chemistry. His vocal phrasing and timing, the delicate purity and strength of her voice; they are well matched in this and truly make the story come alive. I never tire of watching it; it never feels corny or old. The extraordinary lyrics and music as interpreted in this sensitive and well-directed film will be a classic for all time.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I watched this in the theaters and thought it was amazing.  It does not pretend to be anything other than a summer sci-fi action pic.  If you grew up watching Godzilla, Gamera, Harryhausen, Yamato, Macross, or any other anime this movie is for you.  If you haven't seen it in the theaters yet, you need to go now!  This movie looked amazing on the big screen.  I'm sure it will look fine in blu-ray, but the robots and monsters must be seen in size.
0763644765|5.0|This really is just a cute book but the bonus is that it helps baby understand going to the bathroom. The pages are nice, bright colors, with just a few words if any on each page. It is a simple story and not only does it show the baby finally sitting on the potty but how a cat and dog use the bathroom too.<br /><br />My one year old has taken to sitting on her own potty seat while flipping through the pages of the book, occasionally pointing at things and giving the cat or baby kisses. Nothing happens in the potty necessarily but I figure it's a good start. She can sign that she's gone to the bathroom once it's happening in her diaper. Now if I can get her to let me know before it happens, we'd be in great shape. I highly recommend this book!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Had heard so much about Downton Abbey, that I finally wanted to see what all the talk was about!<br />I wasn't disappointed!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app makes it so much easier,  ecspecially when you get the FREE weather forecast that it recommends. This app is great. :)
0307891402|5.0|I bought this years ago (late review) but every now and then I'll glance at the artwork inside and I don't regret my purchase at all.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Kids enjoyed it. Great action! Gave it 4 stars b/c it stopped twice to say \\"Amazon loading video \\" which can get annoying but other than that it was good
B005UA0FLE|5.0|This album gets constant replay in my home during the holiday time. I have converted a few of my family members into a Michael fan, because of this album.<br /><br />Everything about this album is perfect from production, to song choices, and most importantly Michael's voice.<br /><br />He is such a talented artist.<br /><br />I can't say much about his most recent album [[ASIN:B00BIVN82M To Be Loved]]... but nonetheless, I have this album and others to fall back on and fall in love with Michael's voice and music all over again.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Great action/adventure - Robert Downey Junior plays this with the right touch - he keeps it funny with small moments of poignancy.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|It's pretty wacky stuff, but the writing and active are really good.  It shows why cable TV really makes it.
B001PO53IO|3.0|This show would score higher with young children I think. I just couldn't get into it at all... and as a Star Wars fan, I tried.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Great movie, and great soundtrack! This movie is destined to be an absolute cult classic. Soundtrack is very true to film and is very fun to listen to.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|Bought this DVD just because of the gunfight scene.  That however is not the only reason to watch this film.  Good story with strong performances, it doesn't disappoint.
B000I9U8VO|4.0|Always fun to see the Xmen in action. Lots of fun superhero action. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Halle Barry make it quality acting.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Great movie for a low budget film. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes sci-fi or historic type movies
B0018OFN2W|5.0|I think the Fast and Furious movies are a heck of a lot of fun. This is my least favorite of the series - but it's still a 5 star movie IMO. If you liked the first one, I'd suggest checking it out.
B00D02Z1EA|4.0|Scream o is not for me but my kids, especially my teenage daughter loves this purchase.  They honor God with there lyrics.  I just have trouble understanding them, but she and I talk about the lyrics.  They have some really awesome, God honoring lyrics.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I saw part 2 in the theater and when I got home the first DVD was waiting for me.  I watched it right away and loved it as much as the second one.  I would reccomend buying both and watch them over and over again.  Very down to earth and touching stories.
B00C2VGAW2|4.0|I love this!  Listen to it all the time.  One of my favorites.  The case pretty much sucks tho.  It's cardboard and not plastic.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Good product,<br /><br />I received this product about a week after I ordered it. Great series, (Warning! will get you hooked! Even my dad and grandparents loved it) The books are always better, but for an easy summary of the first season this does a great job.
B001GQSY64|3.0|I love Star Wars but I just couldn't connect to the animated version at all. I imagine this would score much higher with young children.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game for some odd reason stays fun. Even though it is a similar action. The mechanics are well made. Overall a great little time waster.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Free literature is always a bonus from the start - but this is an epic story that can speak to people from so many different walks of life. Love the book, Love the musical, (The movie was ok, haha)..... Read it. You need this in your life.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Basically if you don't already have this you need to consider this a sign.  You need to buy it right now.
B000056NX5|4.0|Film is ok, I love the performance. But damn region DVD protection. Had to rip the DVD and burn again to enable playing on my home theather system. Jesus, we are in the 21st century now!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I'm not sure if it's my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; or this program but the camera image onscreen is really poor. Thankfully I don't use it much at all.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game if you like to search for hidden object. I just started and so far I like it. I had to turn up the brightness to find some items but it doesn't seem to be draining my battery too much.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was a very good game, it had really neat puzzles and it really kept my attention. I wish it had more levels :(
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I love Florence + the Machine.  So naturally how can I go wrong with Lungs.  Trick question...it's impossible.  Get it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cool game and makes one think.  I really enjoy it.  Cool that it free so far anyway. good to pass the time.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I haven't run into an issue with viruses or anything on my Kindle yet so I'm not sure how effective this product actually is - but it isn't obtrusive and I like the overall UI of the program. I'll update if there's any changes.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a book that should be required reading for everyone.  Wish I had read it years ago.  It would make a much nicer world.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I enjoyed listening to Susan Boyle again and her beautiful voice.  The bonus of having Donnie Osmond on the CD was added beauty.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I seriously really loved this book I started wanting to read it when I heard they are creating a movie so I got hooked on this book just downloaded book 2:)
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story is one of the most interesting mysteries I have read - if it can be called a mystery.  You really do ask yourself &#34;what is going to happen now?&#34;  I can imagine someone doing these things, but have never known anyone I thought could do them.  It is great fun, but don't get attached to anything you think is the truth.
0753541637|5.0|I will read this book for years to come. A seminal piece for women of my and my mother's generation!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I might like this game IF I could figure out how the heck to play it. I just can't figure it out. I've tried five or more times and I just can't get it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was just an amazing book and the first one too cant wait to read the third. Its just an amazing series
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm a big gamer but this is my favorite game yet.It is one of the most creative games I have ever played.It's great on all systems like pc and Xbox.To me the only downside is that you can't go to the nether in pocket edition.
B00821OX98|5.0|I LOVE THE ACTION, SUSPENE AND THE FAMILY INTERACTION THROUGH IT ALL. KEEPS ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT AND CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT SHOW TO SEE IT!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book so much at some points I cried some I was filled with anger all in all this has to be my favorite series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had no idea what this book was about when I started to read it. I found it on my husbands kindle while on a long flight. I couldn't put it down during vacation.<br /><br />Likes: Hugh, can I call him Hugh...or Hughie, does a great job of character development. I felt completely entrenched in their lives! It really didn't have any downtime. I'm now hoping someone writes a movie script for this book. Do me a favor Hughie and write it yourself so that I'm not irritated by the stupid fluff and changes Hollywood makes to most great novels.<br /><br />Dislikes: this book is over and I still am unsure who has died. A slight irritation though.<br /><br />This is my first review so don't hate me for not writing endlessly about the plot. Read the dust jacket, or be like me and dive in head first for an amazing ride.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Caveat: Huge Firefly fan. Now with that said...<br /><br />Serenity is my third favorite movie, behind &#34;Jaws&#34; and &#34;The Producers&#34;. Just awesome. Some of the best dialogue I've ever heard, and some of the plot twists were awesome. Absolutely loved it, and I'm still holding out hope for more &#34;Firefly&#34; in the future.
B008L5G4I8|5.0|This is an excellent book, with much humor and many twists. I wish Amazon had more of her books in their library, the short stories are nothing like as good in my opinion.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I Love Linsdsey Stirling, she's amazing and this cd doesn't dissapoint, I highly recommend it. If you like dancey tunes that are dramatic, and include violin. This is seriously awesome.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Playing on kindle fire 2nd generation.<br /><br />This downloads quickly, then when you tap it, it takes about 3 minutes to download resources.<br /><br />But after that this game is the absolute best. The graphics are superb.  There is a very good strategy guide.<br /><br />I like how the map shows you completed areas so you don't waste time going back to them.<br /><br />There are many paintings to explore. You do them 1 at a time. Each one is a game of itself.  The next one has totally different scenes and story lines.<br /><br />I find this to be a very long game.  You can play one picture at a time, if you can put it down.  Very good hidden object scenes and minigames.  You can skip a minigame if you want to.<br /><br />Highly entertaining.  Very addictive.  Highly recommend.  Well worth the cost.

He was a legal editor for the Chicago Tribune. He used source material, to include many first sources \\"writings\\" from Romans living at the time, and other first and second sources to make a conclusion. He used investigative reporting to form this book. This book is a fascinating read written by an athiest. You will be surprised by the conclusion.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Until I finished Stephen King's newest novel, 11/22/63, I'd only cried at the end of three of his books over the last thirty-five years.  I remember tears filling my eyes during the scene in The Stand where Stu Redman is left behind by his team to die as they slowly make their way to the confrontation with Randall Flagg.  I was then caught off guard by Johnny Smith in The Dead Zone and let some tears roll when he died at the end.  After that, it was nearly twenty years before Mr. King once again caught me from behind with The Green Mile.  I came close to wailing at the end of that novel because I thought John Coffey would somehow survive and be released from prison.  I remember writing to King and asking how he could kill off such a great character.  He probably thought I was a total idiot.<br /><br />The thing is, I cared so much for these characters that I wanted to see them survive their ordeals, but Stu Redman was the only one who made it through to the end.  This is what lifts Stephen King to the role of a great storyteller.  He creates characters you get emotionally involved with and want to see overcome the challenges that are thrown their way.  I think the reasoning here for me is that if they can overcome the hardships, then maybe we can too.  When they don't, it's like watching ourselves die, and that is certainly a tough pill to swallow.<br /><br />Now, after fifteen years, Stephen King has done it again with 11/22/63.  When I first heard the premise of this novel around the beginning of 2011, I got goose bumps on my arms.  I was born in 1950 and was thirteen years old when John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  I remember being out on the athletic field during gym class and seeing another student come running out from the main building to tell our coach about the President's death.  Since that was the last class of the day, the coach told us to get dressed and go home.  I spent the entire weekend with my nose glued to the television (along with my parents) watching everything unfold in slow motion from replays of the shooting, to Lyndon Johnson being sworn in as the new President, to the shooting of Oswald by Jack Ruby, and finally the walk up Pennsylvania Avenue by Jackie, Carolyn and John-John.  I believe that moment in time affected me as strongly as it did thousands of Americans around the country.  Even people who didn't like JFK or his politics experienced a deep loss at his passing.<br /><br />As I said, I got goose bumps when I read the premise of 11/22/63 about a man travelling into the past to prevent Kennedy's assassination.  If we could, how many Americans would raise their hands up and volunteer to go back in time to try and save him, knowing that he or she might die in the process?  I suspect it would be a high count because the world changed when JFK was killed.  I don't think it became a better place.  Of course, had JFK lived, there's no guarantee it would have turned out better, either.<br /><br />Still--<br /><br />Okay, it's time to look at the novel.<br /><br />Jake Epping is an English school teacher in Maine.  One summer night after an adult class, he's reading a paper by one of his students--Harry Dunning, a janitor at the school.  The paper deals with the night the janitor's life changed forever...the night when his father murdered his mother, sister, two brothers, and crippled him for life.  That the paper moves Jake emotionally is beyond question.  He prompts him to get to know Harry Dunning and to find more about that horrible night.<br /><br />Later, when the owner of a hamburger diner, shows Jake a way to go back in time, an idea starts to jell in the teacher's mind.  The owner of the diner has spent nearly five years of his life in the past with the intent of keeping John F. Kennedy from being assassinated.  Cancer, however, brought his mission to a complete stop.  Now, he wants Jake to take over.  One of the main problems, however, is that the time portal only takes you back to the fallof 1958.  You then have five years to spend, waiting for the right moment to act.<br /><br />Jakes decides to give it a shot, but first he wants to see if he can prevent Harry Dunning' family from being killed on that fateful night in 1958.  If he can accomplish that, then maybe he has a chance at saving Kennedy.<br /><br />Here are the basic rules for time travel in 11/22/63.  You can go back to 1958 as many times as you want, but each time you do, you erase any changes that were made the previous time and have to start over from scratch.  When you leave 2011, go back to 1958, and then return to the present, only two minutes have passed in our time.  You, however, have aged whatever amount of time was spent in the past.  Another rule is that time doesn't want to be changed and will attempt to stop you by throwing unexpected obstacles in your path.  Another very important rule is that for every change you make, it will have a profound effect on the future with the possibility of it being more negative than you planned.  This is called the Butterfly Effect.  A fourth rule is that should you not be able to accomplish your goal, you can always return and try again.  You're also older, but with more insight into what will transpire.  In other words, you now have first-hand experience as well as the knowledge on what to avoid when you travel back in time.<br /><br />Jake has to go back in time twice to complete his mission dealing with the murder of the Dunning family.  The first time isn't as successful as he would've hoped, but the second journey is because he now knows what to watch out for and what his stumbling blocks will be.  This gives him the encouragement to tackle the assassination of John F. Kennedy five years down the road.  But first, he has to find a place to live and to wait out the time.<br /><br />italianpromo_11_22_63<br /><br />Leaving Maine, Jake travels to Florida where he gets a job as a substitute teacher.  He also places large bets with bookies and wins a lot of money.  Of course, he already knows in advance who's going to win the games and matches.  The bookies immediately become suspicious.  They don't mind taking your money, but they hate having to pay off big on long shots.  One thing Jake has learned to do is to trust his instincts.  When his instincts start shouting at him to get out of Dodge, he realizes it's time to leave Florida.  He manages to leave just before his house is blown up.<br /><br />Then, heading to New Orleans for a while, Jake eventually makes his way to the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas.  He scouts out the locations of where he knows Oswald will be living in the future.  Until that particular moment arrives, he has to find a place that is soothing to the soul and where he feels safe.<br /><br />He finds such a place in Jodie, Texas.  This is a small community a few hours from Dallas, but it's just the kind of place he's looking for to spend the next four years.  He soon becomes a substitute English teacher there, which leads into a full-time position.  Teaching is what he loves, and he has a special gift for the job that makes students want to learn and to become all they can be.  Sounds like the Army, doesn't it?  Everybody seems to love Jake Epping, though he now calls himself George Amberson.  In time a lady by the name of Sadie Clayton becomes the new librarian at the high school where he teaches.  He doesn't want to say it's outright love at first sight, but to the reader it certainly is.  He's met the woman of his dreams...someone he can live the rest of his life with and raise a family.  The only problem (and it's a big one) is that he's from the future and there are things he can't tell Sadie about himself.<br /><br />In time, the fact that Jake has no past catches up to him in ways he never expected and to a large degree he loses everything he holds precious in his life.<br /><br />After Jodie, Jake focuses on Lee Harvey Oswald.  He wants to take out Oswald before the assassination attempt, but if the ex-Marine isn't acting along, it won't stop Kennedy from being killed.<br /><br />All, however, is not lost between Jake and Sadie.  When you love someone in a way that transcends time and they love you equally, the two of you simply don't walk away from each other no matter what the problem is.  It's impossible because love is a powerful force...maybe even stronger than the past.<br /><br />Anyway, it won't be long before Jake has to save the life of the woman he loves and then face the bookies in Dallas who already know about him from Florida.  Whether or not Jake can now save the President will be questionable.  As we already know the past has a way of putting obstacles in front of you to keep any changes from taking place.  Jake will have insurmountable odds to face and overcome as he rushes to change destiny.<br /><br />As to what happens, well, you're just going to have to read the book.<br /><br />One thing I can tell you is though this novel is nearly 900 pages in length, there are very few action scenes.  You have one at the Dunning house on Jake's first attempt to save them.  Then there's one where Jakes attempts to save Sadie's life when someone from her past arrives out of the blue to harm her.  Next is the scene with the bookies.  Finally, in the last hundred pages, is the scene of Jake trying to get to Oswald in time before the assassination can take place.  In all, I would say the action scenes total less than forty-to-fifty pages of this very long novel.  The important thing is you don't notice that because you're so wrapped up in the character of Jake Epping and what happens to him.  Once Sadie enters the picture, you're then rooting for both of them to make it.  I don't know of many writers who could succeed with a book this size with it written on so many levels.  I had a difficult time putting the novel down at times.  Though it's long, I still managed to read it in less than three weeks.  In my younger days it would have taken only one week.<br /><br />Another vital thing here is the ending.<br /><br />That's what hit me in the heart, and I don't want to give anything away.  I don't know whether to thank Steve for it, or his son, Joe.  King mentions in the afterword that Joe Hill suggested a better ending for the book and he decided to go with it.  For me, the ending is what shot this novel from the \\"A\\" list to the \\"A+\\" list.  Just a couple of pages grabbed my old heart, shook it back and forth, and made me cry happily about love and its power to override everything standing in its way.  Not very many books have been able to do that to me over the last fifty years.<br /><br />So, is 11/22/63 a winner?<br /><br />Damn right, it is.  For me, this is King's best novel in over a decade...maybe even three decades, if you don't count The Green Mile.  This is a book the author attempted to write in 1972, but it took thirty-eight more years before he could actually succeed in creating this world for the reader to live in.<br /><br />This is what great writing and storytelling is all about.  This is the type of book you don't want to end, but know it must.  And, when the novel finally wraps up, you feel a sense of happiness from the ending; yet, also a sense of loss at not having the main characters in your life any longer.<br /><br />I know I did.<br /><br />Written by Wayne C.

0525953728|4.0|A friend recommended that I read Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for Bin Laden from 9/11 to Abbottabad first to get more context. No Easy Day suffers by comparison. I believe they were both rushed to press.<br /><br />The book is as much about Navy Seals as it is about the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden; nevertheless, it is a fascinating account of the killing of Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />There is a lot of talk about heroes that are appropriate for young people. Navy Seals and other special forces personnel should be at the top of everyone's list.

B001BANK32|5.0|After thirty-six years, I'm finally reviewing Stephen King's The Shining.  If the readers are confused by the price of the book, I purchased one of the hardcover editions published in the nineties with an exceptional dust jacket by Peter Kruzan, Craig De Camp, and Thomas Holdorf.  Doubleday did the six King novels that were published by them with new jackets designed by these three men, and I love the way the covers look.  I have Salem's Lot, The Shining, and The Stand with matching jackets.  The novel, however, is available in paperback for a lot less.<br /><br />Let me say from the start that I consider The Shining (Stephen King's third published novel) to be the scariest book I've ever read.  I've read a lot of great horror novels over the last thirty-five years, including all of King's novels and anthologies, plus those by Robert R. McCammon, Dan Simmons, Peter Straub, Charles L. Grant, Ramsey Campbell, Dennis Etchison, F. Paul Wilson, Joe R. Lansdale, Bently Little, Tom Piccirilli, Richard Matheson, Joe Hill, Ira Levin, William Petty Blatty, and a dozen more.  All of these authors are excellent writers, but no novel has ever cut me to the core like The Shining did in 1977.  I read the novel in less than two days, and it literally scared the bejesus out me.  Since then, I've read it twice more and though the effect of the novel isn't as strong as the first time around, it still stuns me in a way few other books are able to do.<br /><br />Here's an anecdote I think says it all about the craftsmanship of Stephen King's writing.  During the spring of 1983, my mother was dying of cancer.  Because of the radiation and chemotherapy treatments, there was little she could do other than to lie on the couch in the living room and watch television or read.  Most of the time, however, she read her books with the television on in the background.  When it came to reading for fun, mom liked Harlequin Romances.  They were short and easy to read.  Since I worked in a used bookstore, I was able to keep her in reading material.  Another factor that came into play was that I lived with her during this time.  The den (what used to be the garage before being walled in) was kind my area when I did my writing and where my small library of horror novels were shelved.  One night when I came home from work, I found mom on the couch, reading Salem's Lot by Stephen King.  She'd gotten it off of my bookshelf and was already forty pages into it.  When I asked her why she was reading a horror novel and not a Harlequin Romance, mom said she'd gotten bored with the other books.  I don't think you could've paid my mother to read a horror novel, but there she was.  Anyway, she read the book in a week.  After she was finished with Salem's Lot, she got my copy of The Shining and started reading that one, too.  I remember getting home one evening and walking into the living room.  Mom was on the couch and the television was on.  She hadn't heard me come in because she was so engrossed in reading The Shining that she was totally unaware of what was going on around her.  I said, \\"Hi, mom.\\"  She immediate screamed at the top of her voice and threw the book into the air.  It took me a few minutes to get her calmed down.  I realized that I'd startled her, but I also knew in my heart that Stephen King had just scared the crap out of her with his great story.  After mom and I talked for a few minutes, she picked up the book and went back to reading it because she was getting close to the end, and the Overlook Hotel and Jack Torrance were in the process of trying to kill poor Wendy and Danny.  Mom finished The Shining and then started The Stand.  In other words, she was hooked on Stephen King just like me.  Unfortunately, she died before completing The Stand.  I know she would have loved it right to the end, and then would have wanted to read The Dead Zone and Firestarter.<br /><br />I guess the point of the above deviation is that The Shining has never been equaled for its pure fear factor.  The novel is a sheer masterpiece...a classic that made a young, upcoming author famous worldwide.  He not only scared me and millions of others with it, but also my mother who took a gamble in giving up her romance novels to try one by my favorite author.<br /><br />As most readers of horror already know, the book is about the Torrance family acting as caretakers for the Overlook Hotel in the dead of winter.  There is Jack and Wendy Torrance, plus their six-year-old son, Danny, who's psychic and can see glimpses of the future.  The hotel, however, is haunted with the evil energy of ghosts from the past...the ghosts of people who either killed themselves or were murdered.  The Overlook wants Danny Torrance and will use the father's alcoholism to create chaos within the family and then eventually kill them.  As the time of death approaches, the hotel grows in psychic strength, coming alive with memories of the past, offering false promises to Jack if he will bash the heads in of Wendy and Danny with a roque mallet.<br /><br />elite-daily-the-shining<br /><br />As I've said in the past, The Shining is the most terrifying novel I have ever read, and it still scares me pretty good the third time around.  The ghosts and situations at the Overlook certainly have their moments, but what struck home for me was the relationship between Jack and his wife and son.  I come from a family where my step-father was an alcoholic, and I know what it's like to fear the arrival of the drunken party, knowing that one little thing can set the person off in a fit of pure, uncontrollable rage.  I saw my step-father beat my mother when we were overseas and seemingly trapped in a foreign country with no escape.  He could do as he pleased and there was no one to stop him.  The Overlook Hotel captured that sense of utter aloneness and of being cut off from the rest of the world (friends and relatives), while the father slowly goes berserk and then on a wild killing spree.  Stephen King was able to craft every scene with a sense of reality that would come alive in my mind in ways that were truly terrifying to remember.  The author was able to do this because of his own experiences in battling alcoholism and understanding what a person and his family goes through emotionally when dealing with this addiction.<br /><br />Remember, The Shining was published in 1977.  When I first read it, I entered a new world that had been allusive to me in other novels.  The author had (and still has) a special gift for words and description and the creation of characters that few others can match even at this time.  The fiction of Stephen King was literally the next evolution in storytelling.  You could see it in his published novels at the time.  His first published book, Carrie, was written on one level.  Though it was entertaining and different from other novels being published, there were other authors at the time who could have very well written it.  When King wrote Salem's Lot, he did so at a much higher, newer level of writing that offered promises of something far different than what the normal reading audience was used to.  This was a writer who made you believe in the impossible and to hunger for more of his fiction.  The Shining raised the author's writing to an extremely higher state, which included stardom for him.  No one had ever seen the likes of The Shining before.  This was a one-of-a-kind novel that simply blew the reader out of his/her comfort zone and took you places inside your own mind that were normally off limits.  In many ways, this also set the standards for other authors, showing them what the new generation of readers desired.  King could have easily coasted after this novel, but instead he wrote The Stand, which carried him up to still a higher level of craftsmanship and storytelling.  Stephen King raised the bar of fiction writing and forced other authors rise up to this level, if they wanted to make a living as a writer.  From then he has simply gotten better and better with his works reaching the status of literature.<br /><br />The Shining is, and will probably always be, my favorite novel of the thousands I've read during the last fifty years.<br /><br />Here's one last anecdote.<br /><br />I was coming back on a bus from a Zen center in Nebraska in 1991.  We made our way through Colorado and up through the mountains.  The sun was setting, casting an eerie light on the cliffs around us as the bus made its way toward Utah.  When darkness had settled in and the passengers started to get comfortable, a voice sounded from the rear of the bus.  It sounded just like the kid from Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining.  The person in the back started saying, \\"Redrum.  Redrum.  Redrum.\\"  This went on for about sixty seconds.  Everybody was listening to the voice, but no one was saying anything.  Finally, after the voice had stopped and a minute of silence had gone by, people started laughing because they knew what \\"redrum\\" meant and that it came from the movie, The Shining, and that we were in the mountains where the story takes place.  After twenty-two years, I still remember that moment on the bus.<br /><br />One last thought.  Stephen King has finally written a sequel to The Shining.  The new novel is titled, Dr. Sleep and will be out at the end of the summer in 2013.  I think this will be the most anticipated book by Mr. King in his history of being an author.  I know I've been waiting for me to write this novel for over three decades.  I want to find out what has happened to Danny Tolerance and how he's dealing with life and the cards dealt to him.  I suspect this will be one of the best books Stephen King has ever written.<br /><br />Written  by Wayne C. Rogers from Horror Novel Reviews.

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Aslan's greatest problem is that he mistakes his own assumptions as fact.  He leaves no room for the possibility of anything.  When he has no proof for or against that Jesus and John the Baptist were relatives, he immediately assumes that they weren't.  Why not go with, maybe they were or maybe they weren't?  When Aslan says (page 121 of my ARC), \\"Yet if one wants to uncover what Jesus himself truly believed, one must never lose sigh of this fundamental fact: Jesus of Nazareth was a Jew and nothing more,\\"  what makes that a fundamental fact?  Because Aslan says so?  He also said Jesus was \\"magic.\\"  Ignoring what you cannot explain does not create facts, it creates opinions.<br /><br />Beyond the \\"facts\\" of his own creation, there really isn't anything in this book regarding Jesus that I haven't read elsewhere.  I do feel that Aslan's constant assertions that his assumptions are facts very quickly become patronizing to the reader, which colors the positive aspects of this book.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|*SPOILERS*<br />I absolutely loved this series right to about book 8 or 9. I couldn't put them down and read them all about 4 or more times. After that it didn't have the same hold on me. I still really loved them though just didn't have the need to speed read them like the others. I did always look forward to what was going to happen to Sookie next and we finally got a peek into Sookie's future. It was little open but I was happy with that and happy with the choice. I know some aren't agreeable but I think Charlaine kept true to Sookie's character. I couldn't see her with a vampire forever, she always wanted a normal life with marriage and babies and I'm glad she was given that. Mind you I was team Eric all the way! Lol! I just loved them together at the beginning, that spark, passion and lust was all there but I could see it wasn't forever. Behind it all, Sookie deserved to settle down away from all the drama. So this book was the perfect ending.

1451695195|4.0|This book provides another perspective of the afterlife & it is a very descriptive one. Some of it is a little wordy in medical terms, but gives the reader a better understanding of how the brain can & can't function when in a comatose state.  I would recommend this book to Christian & non-Christian readers. Although it is clear the author truly believes in what he experienced, & feels compelled to share his experience to prove the existence of heaven, it is done in a very tasteful way as to give the reader the facts & decide for themselves! This book is an excellent read for those looking for answers to the existence of a higher power!

140006922X|2.0|[[ASIN:140006922X Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth]]<br />I haven't read this book, so my rating is of no importance; however, after seeing a clip of the author being interviewed, I just had to chime in. The man is impressive. In fact, I believe he is the first Muslim intellectual  I have ever seen that impressed me. He gives me hope. There must be others like him.  I'd love to read his book. I greatly regret the fact that I won't. My only excuse is that I already have too many books that I must read, but haven't,  and I'm talking about books that I already have in my library. I happen to be an atheist. Always have been; nevertheless, I am a supporter of Christianity these days when it seems to be under attack from all directions (My enemy's enemy...), and when it is becoming increasingly irrelevant. In this my position is in some ways similar to many supporters of \\"Uncle Joe\\" during the Second World War, except that I don't regard Christianity as evil, while Communism is and was.<br /><br />I suppose the one thing about Christ that bothers me most is whether or not he even existed. Many books have been written on this one point, so doubt on this matter is certainly possible and even respectable. This is why I'd really like to read what the author's book has to say. Without conclusive evidence of Christ even existing, how can his \\"life\\" be put under the microscope, except as one might analyze the character of Achilles? Well, it looks like I've answered my own question. That satisfies. Looks like I don't have to read his book, after all.
B002VWNID6|5.0|This has been one of my go to movies since I was in high school.  To this day, it is still one of my ALL TIME FAVORITES!!  Back then it was VHS and I watched it until the tape wouldn't play anymore.  Now I have it on DVD and will be able to watch it for years to come!  I love the action, the romance, the brotherhood.
B004KZOWEG|4.0|not a bad book, very interesting , but i want able to send it to the kindle which upset me
B00DBSZEH2|2.0|It was so good I fell asleep half way through it. I guess some teeny brained kids will like it.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Should be able to change the picture in the background of your area in sted of it just being the weather and u should make it free. Other wise it is really cool!!
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|I would have liked to have at least tried this game to see if I would have enjoyed it but I tried downloading it 3 times and could never ever get it to open!  The title says for kindle tablet.  Tried it on my kindle fire with no success.  Will not try again.  Nor will I try other big fish games!  Very disappointed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series.  I wish it would never end.  Would like for it to run 20 more wonderful years.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|Fair permissions, nice graphics. So far only played through 4 levels but I love Lemmings-esque games and so far I see good potential. The hints at the beginning of the levels aren't very useful but so far things have been pretty intuitive. My Hint: when you turn a bunny into a stopper, you can start him walking again *and* you can control his direction (look for the faint, translucent arrow over his head when you hit the &quot;walk&quot; command). This knowledge is critical for getting the 3 stars on some levels but might not be obvious. It's counter-intuitive if you're used to Lemmings where once you convert a.walker into something it's permanent. I'm playing it on my Galaxy S3 and it works like a champ.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|With that said, there was simply too much back peddling and not enough action as in the previous books.  Sylvia, please don't make us wait as long for the next Crossfire and please make it worth the wait!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the best game I have discovered since temple run 2 . The only bad thong is the sound of the drivers neck when you crash other then that I recommend this.game totally GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!:):):):):):):):):):)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Really beautiful book, so easy to read! You lose yourself in it and even ideentify with the characters. With a huge message.<br />Recommended for everyone, except little kids.
034580709X|5.0|The writing is excellent as is plot and character development.  The setting in Australia adds to the interest.  Good descriptions of Aboriginal problems and life style.
B00CLT31D6|4.0|Well, the research is well done, and the book is very well written. However, the numbers are not converted to reflect as of today's value (inflation etc). If a reader is reading a book as of 2013, the numbers seems off. Overall, a good read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Having read all 3 of his books, this does not disappoint. Perhaps the overarching work that unites the other two into a trinity of a study of character. If The Kite Runner is about courage & guilt while &#34;A Thousand Splendid Sons&#34; is about love we have here the convergence of them all. A journey into human relationships, love, the Courage needed to express it, the guilt felt when we assume we have not expressed it & realize the time to do so has passed. An incredible story with this authors now trademark characters that he develops so vividly the reader believes he knows them. A treatise on time, the effect it has on our interpersonal relationships, the importance of appreciating the connections we have now, lest they be lost, and the hope, courage & determination to find them again once they are. To quote from Hosseini, &#34;Afghans like to say: Life goes on, unmindful of beginning, end, kamyab, nah-kam, crisis or catharsis, moving forward like a slow, dusty caravan of kochis.&#34;
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|If you are in favor of heroes and unearthly characteristics, I would like to recommend this movie to you. It is rife of extraordinary fights.
B005MLP8E0|5.0|Watched Citizen Kane again. I've watched it so many times I've lost count! This is still Welles's greatest film. The direction, editing, sound, filming, acting is all first rate. A film that doesn't seem to age with time.
B00DHNJ0I0|5.0|I loved this movie referencing crime and revenge.  It was never a dull moment and a twist at the end.  Great to watch and adventurous and kept you wondering what would happen next.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome! So much variety in it! It doesnt get boring quickly like temple run does.<br />I highly recommend this game to EVERYONE
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If it would not have been come from Amazon directly, I would have thought ist is some Advertisement. Aside from that I learned a lot about better using Word. A must for everybody considering to write eBooks<br /><br />Richard Riversky<br /><br />Author of A Retiree Now?

B008602KQI|4.0|It is fully exciting and rife of awesome action scenes. You can never forecast what happen in next scene. But i did not like children slaughter.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Was not compatible with my Kindle Fire and it took up to 8 hours for a complete charge! Had to call Amazon and order a new one!
B000FC1AGG|4.0|As reviewed on KayFrayBooks<br /><br />I fell in love with Emma! I love how she talks about all of the worries and stresses that we all feel (but keep to ourselves). You just have to love the way her mind works. Laugh out loud book that will have you reading every book you can find by Sophie Kinsella<br /><br />Can You Keep a Secret? is similar to other Kinsella books in that there is no insta-love. It seems like most romance novels spend less than a third of the book on the “falling in love” and the rest on sex and drama. Not so with this story. Essentially, the entire book is the courtship.<br /><br />Obviously, the personalities are a little over-the-top, but that is what makes it so funny. There are times when you want to jump into the book and cover Emma mouth because you can tell that she is about to put her foot into it in a big way.<br /><br />Kinsella has such a way with words.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|although there are a few times of being stuck...I have found this game challenging but not so difficult that I become frustrated.  it can be addictive!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|If you need a complex plot to keep you interested in a film, then this is not for you. But, if you enjoy a comic-style action plot with clear baddies and heroes, then this film will bring you into the Dredd cannon in an enjoyable way. I read 2000 AD back in the day, and this movie flows like some of the simpler, but still classic, Dredd stories where a perp is identified and brought to justice, with some difficulty. A bonus here is the appearance of Judge Anderson as a rookie, and while the actress's portrayal is bad, Urban's perfect Dredd scowl and intonation makes up for the slight.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|i chose 5 stars as my rating because im a tim burton fan. also, my package came on time. the dvd had a few scratches but nothing that compromised the way the movie played. other than that, i love it. thank you so very much
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! I am completely addicted and can't stop playing. The graphics are beautiful and the characters and courses are awesome.
B000ID1J0E|2.0|My husband thought it was good, but I just couldn't get into the constant absurdity and obsessing.  The ONLY Johnny Depp movie that I couldn't get into.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup was a breeze, and everything works as expected.  Sending videos to the TV to watch is now simpler than ever.  It's not advertised as a feature, but going into the chrome browser on desktop and typing in \\"c:/\\", or whatever drive your music/movies are on lets you stream those directly as well.  With the 3-month netflix promotion, $35 was a no-brainer.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|100th episode was wonderful, i am so glad i found this show. excellent acting and well written characters, a must see.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Good product love it not much else to say it delivers real sound by that I mean it does add any extra highs, mids, or lows.. If I had to I would purchase this product again.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This had become my 3 year old granddaughters favorite game on my phone.  She just loves it!  It keeps her busy and quiet!! :)
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My daughter made me catch up by watching Despicable Me before watching Despicable Me 2.  Just loved it.  I'm not a huge movie watcher. Something has to be lighthearted and fun to keep me interested.  If I don't fall asleep during a movie, it's a big thumb's up!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I began watching the show on a recommendation and wasn't expecting much from it. I've enjoyed the character development , the dialogue and the plots. But what makes the show a winner  is the cast. It has been a pleasure watching season one without commercials on Amazon.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I was going through a tough time when this book was recommended to me. Not only did the research and suggestions in this book help me get through that tough time, they have continued to have a positive impact on my success and happiness. I have since purchased this book for several of my friends and family, and purchased two extra copies that I constantly have out on loan. I can't recommend it enough!<br />This book is good for people who are already happy, and for people who are struggling. If you don't have the characteristics he describes, he gives straightforward advice on how to develop them in yourself.<br />Please read this book!
034580404X|5.0|This book was extremly well written.  I truly enjoyed the book 50 Shades of Grey.  I am just now reading hte other two books.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is very emotionally powerfull. I actually cried- like a baby. Loved all the characters and especially the storyline.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|After reading the sample, I had to download the whole book. I confess that my screen name matches my habits: always trying to learn something new. In this case, I learned about the keystone habits: that one habit which, if learned, can propel a person to develop other habits resulting in overall improvement.<br /><br />This book intersperses theory with actual examples. I like that balanced approach.<br /><br />Although I'm not done with the book yet, I hope to gain lots of tips that I can share with my college students.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Enjoyed the series.  Solid acting and interesting story lines.  If you enjoy historical fiction, this is a series to check out.
1483934772|5.0|Much loved story of special beauty. Intriquing and outstanding charaters. Sheryl writing of words quite unique. Brings you to a mystical land.
8466318291|4.0|Casi siempre disfruto las novelas de Millás y no son tan difíciles para los angloparlantes. A mi juicio la novela subraya el hecho de que nuestras identidades sean poco estables.
B008JFUPPI|2.0|Okay, I really wasn't expecting much from this movie. I read some reviews before I saw it and I thought really? Could it be that bad? And, I got to say, they were not exactly wrong. The movie has something to it. It has great actors, great acting, great directing, great CGI, but the story. The story just didn't cut it. There is something there, but it needs MORE!!!<br /><br />I felt that the story could had been so much better told. It needed more details to it. The movie felt too rush. One part where I felt they could had expanded the movie was the training of the new rookie cop. The training was pretty much one scene so that was super fast training. They could had made it a few more scenes with jokes too. There was just so much potential there and they wasted it.<br /><br />Another part I felt was lacking was the background story to the old cop or more details about R.I.P.D. We really don't know that much about either. I don't know about you, but they really could had added more depth to the both stories than what they did. I only say this because the audience needs to actually care about those characters and to do that, they must give us details on what/who, they really are. Why they do the things they do? We barely cover the surface of the rookie cop, old cop, or the R.I.P.D. I say it's just not good enough! So, who would care if they died for good? So, why should I watch this movie again? It's not worth seeing, if you don't make me believe in them in the first place.<br /><br />Let me give you example on how fast this movie really was. Towards the middle to middle-end of the movie, there a HUGE problem with the after life. This is supposed to be the main agenda that the bad guys has been working towards achieving throughout the movie and the good guys are still a half a step behind. So, all hell breaks loose and you want to know how fast they solved the main agenda? The problem that would end of world/universe as we know it? That just so crazy how they solved the so disastrous problem. It only took them 10 mins to figured it out and saved the world. Apparently, it wasn't as crazy to solve as they made it sound out to be.  It was just way too fast with no details on how they got it to work out in the end. What's more is, the bad guys said, it took forever to set everything in to plan; decades of work! All those decades of hard work and planning for nothing! The bad guys made me believe it took them FOREVER to get to that point, where they can turn the ties of power in their favor finally. But, for the good guys to fix everything was not convincing at all.<br /><br />Now do you want to know what the good guys did to fix everything? Well, it didn't take much at all. It took the good guys to solve the problem within 10 mins and they didn't explain how that would even work. What a waste of story time. They just can't expect me to take this seriously, when they solved the crisis within 10 mins. They really didn't need to do that much to solve it. It was like any untrained man off the street could had done the same thing, he had no idea of what he needed to do or what was going on. But, he just goes there and just does it. Man, what the heck was that!<br /><br />So, they didn't do anything more with the story and it failed. Also, the jokes were not as good either. Most of the time, it seemed forced and didn't even get me to smile. Some would say it was too cheesy. Finally, the ending didn't mean anything to me as I didn't care for the characters.<br /><br />I don't feel like this movie is worth buying or watching for that matter. So, just pass on this one.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|It's by far the best tv show I've seen. We used to love Deadwood but BB is much better. Great acting and even better writing.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Before I start with my review for Logitech G930, let me first talk about my previous experience with Logitech products. I had several Logitech product in the past, 2 headphones, 1 keyboard and several mouses. All of them spoilt within a year, yes, you didn't read that wrongly, ALL OF THEM and WITHIN A YEAR, not exaggerating. I know, those were the cheaper products of Logitech and you only get what you pay for. That is exactly why I've given Logitech another chance by getting the G930 headset, they were supposedly \\"GAMING GRADE\\", so I thought a gaming grade headset would be of higher quality and will last longer, I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO WRONG.<br /><br />So let's move into the review of the G930 headset. When I first received the product, it wasn't that bad, honestly. They scored in sound quality and comfort, these headphones were comfortable, I had to give this to them. However, after just 4-6 months of using the headset, it started to fail. I couldn't even power on the wireless headset, I'm not sure whether the battery has failed or the power button is faulty, but I just couldn't turn them on even after charging for hours. The headset is totally dead now.<br /><br />I've tried to escalated the case to Logitech directly, and they agreed that the headset is now defective. But because I'm from Singapore, I could not get a replacement unless I have an US address. So what now Logitech? I have to buy a property in the United States to get a replacement for a headset?!<br /><br />In conclusion, I would strongly NOT recommend anyone purchase Logitech products. Additionally, I would also recommend Singaporeans to avoid buying stuff from Amazon as the warranty for the product WOULD NOT be valid in Singapore even if the company have an office in Singapore.
B00D6OV57O|5.0|Not as much variety as the Dark Knight soundtracks but nearly so and it's all good, making it a worthy buy
B00DBEDYDC|4.0|Is excelent to learn tecniques about fold fabrics. And the drawing show the tecniques help a lot of, more than if those were pictures.
140006922X|5.0|I swear if you want to find the real person trying to brainwash you please click on the one star ratings. Look out the ROMAN army is coming 1 star rating mob.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I added the near future caveat because currently the only apps that include casting are YouTube, Netflix, and Google Play's media apps. From what I've read online, developers are working on adding the feature to all the apps I want to see included (more specifically, PLEX).<br /><br />So what makes this device so awesome? It's not doing anything a whole lot different than my Roku or Xbox 360. It streams music and video just like any other internet streaming box does. So what's the big deal with this? It's cheap, it's easy to use, it's good for parties, and most importantly it makes watching video content over the internet more enjoyable. Let me explain.<br /><br />Currently:<br /><br />When watching videos online, you typically choose the video you want to watch using some remote that isn't great at navigation and typing input. After choosing said video, you watch it and then navigate again through the same ok navigation (probably taking a few minutes to pick your next video). All this time whoever is in the room with you is watching as you go adventuring through the media wild. Not much of a good coop experience (unless the second viewer can chuck things at you while waiting for the next video to start).<br /><br />Chromecast:<br /><br />Here's the beauty of Chromecast. TVs with d-pad type remote controls aren't good ways to navigate a large amount of digital content. So why do we think we need the remote control? Why not use that awesome little smart device almost every person has these days in their pocket? It has a keyboard, touch navigation, AND it's not coupled to the TV's display. That last part is key. So in the same scenario as before, I could be watching a show with a friend and, without interrupting our video, add some more videos after the one that is currently running. When our video ends, it just moves on to the next video in the queue. Cool right?<br /><br />Not only that, but your video/music can also become party play! Anyone in the house that is connected to your WiFi with an Android, iPhone, Windows Mobile, or Blackberry device can add to your queue. So now you have a Jukebox of music and video, where anyone can take control of your media without anything more than getting your WiFi password.<br /><br />Now I know some of this is already possible with AppleTV, but even there you have to use Apple only devices. With Chromecast, anyone can join in.<br /><br />I love using my phone/tablet to control what content I watch on my TV. I'm done with controllers.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Another thing I realized yesterday at my parents' house while showing off their new Chromecast:<br /><br />The Chromecast turns your mobile device into a digital right media hub. So remember that example I made before about multiple people in the room having control of what content gets displayed on the TV? Well last night I realized that this also makes sharing the content you own or subscribe ridiculously easy. Take watching HBO Go, once they add support for casting to Chromecast, I could go to a friend's house and cast Game of Thrones straight to his TV. We wouldn't have to input a login/password or activate his device with HBO. It would just work. Or say I have bought some movies on the Play video store, I could cast them as well. So pretty much my phone is now a portable media hub for everything I own on the cloud and there is nothing more to sharing that content at a friend's house than just bringing my phone with me.<br /><br />I know I'm starting to sound like a sales person here but I just love how such a ridiculously basic device can totally change my concept of watching media. I love when things just work!

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As an atheist I am fascinated by the Bible and am always eager to learn more about it.  Not sure why the religious right in this country believe that Jesus belongs to them only.  Mr. Aslun is a noted scholar who has thoroughly researched the life of Jesus and I am intrigued by his take on the Christian messiah.  Wonderful job.
B00ABLJ5NQ|2.0|I enjoyed the book,however being the fourth book of Gaimabs that I've read, to me it's a little rushed and doesn't seem to have the same intensity as other stories.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Just when I think it can't possibly be better than the last, this author creates another, more beautifully written story. He portrays lives in Afghanistan from various social-economic backgrounds, intricately connecting some together, and makes you feel like you know them personally. I was engrossed from start to finish. Five well deserved stars.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I'm pretty happy with this B.S. effort. Iommi is the king....even with Ronnie singing they were great....but it's nice to have Ozzy back, for sure.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|wow im constantley wanting to check my wall and finnaly my kindle has the app awesome its very manageable awesome.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|There are so many things wrong with this book. The characters are not believable, the descriptions don't always make sense and the copy editing is nearly non-existent. I'm all about romantic comedies and will fall into a book that isn't even all that well written if I feel like the characters are likable in some way but I just spent the whole time saying &#34;oh, come on!&#34; At least pretend like you're trying to make them believable. Like a really hot, rich, handsome guy is just going to take you home after a drunken night and want to stay married to you. This like a worse version of &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; and that book was already a low caliber book.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The game would not upload properly.  We kept getting a warning that the game 'had a problem' uploading.  I had A very disappointed 5 year old.

B007FKI9G0|1.0|I really wanted to see this movie so I signed up to watch it by downloading using my Prime account.  I tried watching it and was unable to do so because the movie would play about a minute and then download for a minute.  It would then play for a minute and download for a minute.  I gave up on trying to watch this movie.  That is why I gave it a rating of one star.  It was totally unwatchable.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very hard to stay with at first- the female character was annoying. Then the storyline changed dramatically and it became very, very good. But I didn't like the ending at all.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|One of the best films that Val Kilmer acted in. We were so surprised in how fast we received the blu-ray. It looks so much better on Blu-ray.

B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Be forewarned.  \\"Quartet\\" was made by grown-ups. It is a beautifully done film about aging, music, love, talent, egotism, the joy of life, etc.  So you might not like it.

B00CDY6HW6|5.0|I'm through level 7 and have been enjoying this game immensely. It's simple, intuitive, and challenging in a fun way. More app developers need to get a clue like this developer did. Great job!
B00BOXZAG6|1.0|This was the worst 3D I have ever seen. It was converted to 3D after the movie was shot, but I guess they didn't have the budget to pay someone to do a professional conversion. Not only is a there a lack of depth, but there is a very strange, disturbing look to the picture, especially when there is any motion going on. It's hard to describe, but there's sort of a flashing or strobe effect going on. I thought maybe it was an artistic effect, but it was actually starting to give me a headache.<br /><br />After ten minutes I had to give up on it. I thought that maybe the disc was defective, but it was brand new from a sealed box, and when I switched from 3D to 2D mode the strobe effect stopped and the movie was watchable. Unfortunately it still wasn't interesting. Some of the other reviews here have pointed out some of the flaws of this movie, so I won't bother to repeat them all. Visually, even without the horrible 3D conversion, it looks monochromatic and not very exciting.<br /><br />It's a pity. I get the feeling the people who made this movie were trying to do something a little different and really tried hard to make it work, but the end result feels overly obvious and boring. And they can't possibly have thought the 3D conversion really looks any good. That was just a cynical marketing effort. I've learned my lesson... only main stream big budget movies can afford to do proper 3D conversion. I suggest you don't waste your waste your time and money on this.<br /><br />One final observation: After looking through some of the other reviews I didn't see any that described the botched 3D conversion in any detail, as I've attempted to do. Why is that? I couldn't really say. Maybe someone did describe it, but I just didn't read every single review. Or maybe people who bought the 3D version want to sell it and feel bad reviews will hurt their chances of making a sale. Personally I wouldn't feel right trying to sell it. It's really that bad.
B008133MDK|5.0|I love this show! There better be a season 3 coming! This is a great twist on a old school show! I am addicted!
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|Great addicting game but needs an easier way of earning coins. Maybe pickups in game of chests or something like that.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Every so often I am blown away by how much I enjoy and connect to a story. Slammed is one of those rare books. From the first few pages I found myself sucked into Layken's story and was heartbroken time and time again as her life took turns I didn't want it to. Since finishing the book last week, I've found myself thinking about the story and I am so excited to start Point of Retreat. I don't know what expectations I had for this story, but they were far exceeded.<br /><br />Layken's had a rough time. First, her father dies unexpectedly. Then her mother up and moves the family from sunny Texas to chilly Michigan. Then she meets the boy of her dreams, only to learn they can't be together and there's nothing she can do about it. In her struggles to be at peace with her father's death, forgive her mother, and cope with the loss of hopes for a happy future, we are taken on a journey of love, loss, forgiveness, compassion, and family.<br /><br />I'll happily admit this book made me cry. Several times. I'm quite the emotional reader, but not all--or many, really--books touch me enough to really cry. A lot of what Slammed deals with are deep fears of my own. (Not the part about why she can't date Will, though!) I don't think I could handle what she goes through, but reading about a character who deals with hardship in a realistic way is so refreshing. She gets mad and goes storming off. Layken can be selfish and doesn't set her priorities properly, but these are mistakes we all make--especially as teenagers. But seeing Layken overcome her these mistakes for the good of her family is so satisfying and touching.<br /><br />Yes, there are flaws in Slammed, but they hardly detracted from my reading experience. This one definitely takes the cake as my favorite new adult novel--if that's what you classify it as, otherwise I just loved it. :)
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Has been a good listen.  Worth the discounted sale price at the time I picked it up for sure. No real suprises, album sounds generally as expected from what you've likely heard of hers.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book should be required reading for anyone even thinking about being in a relationship.  This information can translate to not only marriages, but any significant relationship, including children too.  Not only will you gain insight into your significant other, but yourself as well.  An absolute must read!
B002UZXJA6|5.0|If you love celtic music this is the album for you. Very strong vocals from the ladies and back ground instruments add to it's strength.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|solid movie, although not as good as the trilogy that spawned it.  i think that's because the main characters are so different and as much as i like jeremy renner, i love matt damon.  this is basically another character's story happening at the same time as the 3rd jason bourne movie.  it's interesting and has a lot of the elements of the first 3 movies and i hope it will be followed by more movies in the same vein.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's been a fun game to lose time to.  Sometimes a challenge ,  but most times just enjoyable.  I'd tell my friends about it.
B005HSL626|5.0|You can do this fun game while you are waiting for something else plus it is a fun game for everyone
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is such a great app. I use it everyday and I love it, you can also look at weather anywhere in the world.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|i grew up on everything star trek, from the original series to the offshoots.  the only one i didn't really get to see a lot of was enterprise, but that was due to scheduling mostly.  what i did get to see, i really enjoyed.  i am SO happy to see them rebooting the series with an alternate timeline.  as much as i love the original cast, i love this cast just as much.  they have good chemistry and amazing acting skills - they didn't go so much for pretty as people with charisma and character.  seriously - the actor that plays scotty is not really like the original and yet you can't really help but love him.  love the characters, interesting storyline, i watch this all the time i want to sit and just enjoy a movie.  i hope there are many, many more.
B005DJREJS|5.0|A lil melo dramatic but still good acting on many of the character's part. Mean girls meets MTV... Jenna Lives!!!
B00ANDDBBE|4.0|The price was definitely right for this volume of Doctor Who. I expected delivery within 2-3 weeks but was pleasantly surprised when it showed up only a week after I purchased it. It was in great condition, which is what I expected ordering it &#34;New&#34;. I didn't have to contact the seller/customer service so I gave it an automatic full star for that as well. The only thing keeping me from giving it a full 5 stars is that I haven't had a chance to actually view the DVD yet so I can only assume that it's in perfectly working condition.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Great book! Such an incredible story of survival and Fate! This is a highly recommended book... I had a great time reading it.
0553328255|4.0|This is a two paperback book set, nicely packaged together in a box.<br />The forward in Book One, defending Dr Watson is a riot!  He was not the bumbling idiot the movies portrayed.  In fact, Watson is a bit of a bounder!  The forward sets the stage for what the reader will discover, from Sir Conan Doyle's pen, is the real Sherlock.<br /><br />One small, really small, do-better is the size of the two volumes.  Vol.1 is quite thick vs Vol. 2.  So as a stuffed in a brief case or night stand book, Vol.1  is a handful.  It might have been better to package the two books at about even size or perhaps in three volumes.  I know consideration for the sequential presentation of Doyle's writing is a consideration that might not allow for that.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Where do I start... let's just say I am very happy that I watched this on amazon and not on USA... It would have killed me to have to wait months for season 3 to start. I don't know how I am going to wait for season 4....ahhhh...
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|The game is a good one but I dont like the idea of not being disclosed that it is a trial version with only so many levels to play before having to purchase a full version.  Granted it is fairly cheap but it should be dsiclosed at the time of deciding to download it.  Otherwise I like the game.
B0043VDIAG|1.0|This book was very depressing and I am sorry that I every read it.  I would not receommend it to anyone.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|This study Bible has great notes, illustrations, and introductions to books.  And the translation is stellar.  I highly recommend this study Bible.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I still don't get how to play the game even though it has a tutorial. It is kind of confusing when you need to fix the trucks. Otherwise I like the game. ;-p
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Very clever, actress really does a great job portraying many characters.  Very interested to see how this goes.  Love it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app. It gets u frustrated just enough to make u keep going.it teases the mind and makes u use it brain
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Blaine does an excellent job writing this man's story. His life long imprisonment, the murders of his family and friends while he watched, and his final escape from North Korean labor camp. Labor camps are denighed by the NK government yet visible by common google sattelite imagery. Take this to heart folks, this is Nazi Germany amplified!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good dictionary, favorite part is the back i enjoy the abbreviations also enjoy how much detail it gives, very nice dictionary
B00DGN51O8|2.0|Poor acting and very boring, uneeded gross scenes, just over all a bad movie.  A waste of time and money.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|I took a chance on renting this.  If you liked Inception, you'll probably like this.  The special effects were amazing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I think this young man has a wonderful voice.  I love his songs and his enthusiasm and emotion.  He is very cute, too.  Now, now,<br />he reminds me of my surrogate grandson.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Initially I didn't think I liked the album. After completely listening to the album in it's entirety a few times I have eally come to like it a lot. It is different from Daft Punk I am used to as I am sure it is for others, however if listened to with an unpredjudice ear one would hear another musical masterpiece.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a movie you will not want to miss. I hope the second is as good as the first.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Like always a great book.  Could not put it  down.  Lots of adventure which I like.  Looking forward to the next one.
0767903862|3.0|Really good writing and very funny. Not what you would want as a travel guide though. At least I don't think so. Could likely tell you more when I return.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  It is so nice to listen to the Bilbe story without having to read it myself and try to pronounce all the diffent names.  I recommend this for anyone that wants to start at the beginning of the bible and go forward.  Great!!, because
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|I love this movie! It is a dramatic but light-hearted romantic version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. All the actors in it are great.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|The general gist of this movie was about what you would expect, though the specific details were nicely done and less predictable.  The real stars of this movie are the musical performances of the supporting actors, real-life retired musicians, because there is not that much plot for the great actors here to flesh out.  I'm not into opera at all, but I alway appreciate skilled performance. A nice touch was including photos of the supporting actors earlier in their careers in the credits. Enjoyable but ultimately forgettable.<br /><br />The complexities and issues of old age were depicted in a shallow manner, for anyone who has dealt with the issues of actual declining old people.  However, for those who are unfamiliar with aging in real life, this will make the movie a bit richer.<br /><br />But for me, the real problem with this movie was the storyline, which is close to minimalist and was too predictable.  Things which could have made good scenes, such as a real discussion between two enemies causing them to move beyond their hate, or a lament about what it is like dealing with flimsy memory, are simply not there. It dragged near the end -- it would have been better to tighten up the pacing so that there was room to include the scene that was deleted (see IMDB for details - it would have been interesting to include on the DVD as an outtake).<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman, the director, was recently interviewed by Terry Gross on Fresh Air, and he spoke a bit about this movie and other topics -- what an interesting guy!  The transcript and audio of this interview can be found on the NPR site.  I really appreciate his body of work much more after hearing that interview.<br /><br />p.s. If the title of this review doesn't ring any bells, see the explanation at tvtropes.org .
B0092S4WLY|2.0|App has been out for how long, and there is only 8 levels.... When will New levels be added? 3/5 because the gAme is way too short. Otherwise I would have rated it higher.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|But, I loved it. I was put off by the implausibility of the premise at first, and I didn't love Conner in the beginning. By the end, though predictable, I was won over. The entire story is very sweet. A quick, happy read.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|I really liked this story, elements of this story will someday make a great movie.  I am intrigued with the Robin's. I need to learn more about Stephanie Brown  :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not at all what I expected, but glad there is closure. Makes me wonder about what the future holds for them.
0345529057|5.0|Great epic of plotting, scheming, war and fantasy. Great characters and lots of heartbreak. The world created by George R. R. Martin is not for the meek.<br /><br />The twist and turns the story takes will keep your intrigue and keep you guessing.
0062112430|5.0|This first book in the YA dystopian/romance Delirium Trilogy was simply amazing! Lauren Oliver can certainly write a page-turner, and her writing is beautiful. I would read this book just for her gorgeous words and sentences.<br /><br />This is one of those books that I could not put down, and spent hours reading until I had finished it. The plot is very interesting and intense - obviously, any story with the idea that \\"love is a disease\\" is going to be interesting.<br /><br />Lena Halloway is a seventeen-year-old in the future city of Maine, where her world is run by a government who is convinced that love is a disease, and at the age of eighteen each person gets a brain operation that removes love and emotion from them. But ninety-five days before Lena's eighteenth birthday, when she will have her procedure, she does the forbidden and unthinkable: she falls in love.<br /><br />The setting and plot was very nicely done, and the writing, as I said before, was simply amazing. The characters were likable, though they didn't instantly shoot up to the top of my \\"Favorite Characters\\" list. The ending was amazing in a horrible, shoot-you-in-the-heart kind of way; after finishing this book, I couldn't get the second one fast enough.<br /><br />Be warned of violence, romance, swearing, and a killer ending, as I already mentioned. I would say this book is for 14+, though it is marked as \\"young adult,\\" which can mean 12+. The violence is not extreme, though definitely for the older genre, but the romance is pretty intense, including references to sex, and there is an un-descriptive scene where Lena takes off her shirt in front of Alex. As for the swearing, h---, d--n, sh--, and b---- are used continuously, and f--- is used twice.<br /><br />If you enjoyed [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] by Suzanne Collins, or [[ASIN:0062024035 Divergent]] by Veronica Roth, I recommend this series.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the Q&A with Lauren Oliver that was included in this special edition, and the sneak peak of Pandemonium, the second book in the three-part trilogy.<br /><br />Well, what are you waiting for? If you heed my warnings and are in the age and genre groups I mentioned, go reading Delirium! You won't regret it.ion, and the sneak peak of Pandemonium, the second book in the three-part trilogy.<br /><br />Well, what are you waiting for? If you heed my warnings and are in the age and genre groups I mentioned, go reading Delirium! You won't regret it.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|Wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to pay for it at the end of the fourteen day period.
0385344228|5.0|Although I am a voracious reader, I could count on one hand the number of crime thrillers I have read.  But \\"Defending Jacob\\" compelled me to write the very first review I have ever submitted.  It was, indeed, a page-turner, but so much more. I know a number of attorneys who have read it and felt that the legal account was surprisingly realistic. The description of Jacob and the other young teens depicted, with their mysterious teen talk, was right on (and I work in a middle school). And the complexity of the murder itself and the twists and turns which kept me consistently engaged were masterful.<br /><br />However, for me, the aspect of this novel most critical was the human side.  It propels the reader not only into the intriguing realm of considering how far a parent will go to protect his/her child but much further into the depths of the struggles of the human soul itself.  I finished the novel 2 weeks ago and simply cannot let go of it., keep revisiting it in my mind.  Mr. Landay does a stunning job of making it impossible for the reader not to feel the exquisite pain which Andy and Laurie experience.  While some readers totally disagree, as a mother, I could imagine how the shocking end to this rich, dark, multi-faceted, human story made perfect sense. I loved, loved, loved It.
B0035G0U2O|4.0|Movie was action packed but would be much to long for the little ones that would be watching. Good Movie!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good read, very steamy, It moves fast!  You won't be bored with this book.  May even have some tips for you (smile)
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Totally enjoyable movie from beginning to end.  Loved the concept of the whole franchise and how each of the superhero movies built on each other culminating in this one.
B001KZG99A|1.0|Tried to download several times from different severs and still couldn't get more than 38 minutes of the 2 hour plus movie with over 4 hours of downloading . This is a recurring problem with amazon movies. There was also a Star Trek Voyager download I never managed to get.. Sometimes it works sometimes it don't, I'm done trying.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This is a movie I've loved for years and wanted my children to see it (almost grown).  I'm happy to have it in my movie collection!

B003GX5CWY|5.0|I just wanted a \\"digital\\" copy that I could take with me wherever i went. Its always been my favorite movie. Not sure what others were complaining about when they mentioned the remastered touch ups. Seemed fine to me. \\"Go! Get to the choppah!\\" Hahahahaha!!!!!!!

B0092S4WLY|5.0|I enjoyed sitting next to my 7 year old daughter and helping her play this game.  Made for great teamwork.  She was able to do several &#34;floors&#34; on her own but it's still challenging enough to hold an adults interest.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the minions are very cute, the game is challenging. my kids love it. They said it's more fun than subway surfer.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book is more like a novella than a full-on novel - it was over before I knew it. It's billed as Gaiman's first book for grown-ups in a while but I think a teen/young adult would enjoy it as well (there is one brief, vague instance of sexytimes).
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It's been a long time since I have read a book that I can relate to so well! This book just amazed me front to back! Do read!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app while traveling. It is wonderful to help me get sleep in a somewhat noisy environment as a lot of hotels can be. It takes the edge off the background noise by giving you something soothing to listen to.  There are a large number of choices to choose from.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|After having having just discovered this author, I have read all three of his books. The books make the reader feel like they too are a part of the story.  I look forward to to many  more books from Mr. Hosseini.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Craving a WWI-era soap opera-esque drama set among the aristocrats and servants at an old English manor? This is like that. A good read for between seasons of Downton.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Wish there were more like him!  What an amazing life he lived in such a short time! Job well done to the writer, Eric Blehm!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The first one was interesting, it drew you in. Although it was all a fantasy and was a bit ridiculous in some areas, it was fun to read. I'm not sure what I expected. But this was boring, more ridiculous than the first, repetitious junk. I would rather get a root canal than read the third one , no thank you.
1601251505|5.0|Pathfinder is a wonderful set of rules.  Compared to new rules (v4.0) these are what old players want.  My group played 4.0 over a year and struggled to accept it.  Then one of us picked up an old version of D&D v3.5.  It was refreshing to get back to the feel of D&D.  I put my hands on Pathfinder and was blown away.  Rules should be coined as v3.75.  What a tremendous tome!  Artwork is superb (Wayne Reynolds is amazing) and a good re-write of rules.  It is a good product the new player as well as the veteran player alike.  We have switched our D&D games to this version.  The core rules book is a massive book, 575 pages.  Has everything in it you need to play except monsters, which is a separate book.  The book originally cost $50,  but I bought it used through Amazon, and the book I received is in above excellent shape.  I swear it is a brand new book.  If you're looking for the true D&D, this is the way to go.

B00285K1KE|1.0|I can add nothing new too how truely awful this misguided version of The Hulk was.. I had the opportunity to see a leaked rough version of this film years ago.. The CGI was incomplete and I at least got a couple of chuckles out of seeing The Hulk toss around tanks without any pants on. That version would have received better reviews than the finished boring and aimless dud it turned out to be. How is it possible that some of the creative minds that get a chance to bring these classic characters to the screen just totally miss the mark of knowing who the core audience is for these comic book adaptions. Shame.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I thought t was rushed.  I was extremely disappointed at how mush it dragged.  I hate not giving a good rating but I was not happy with this book.  would have waited several months for book three if it would have been as well put together as the first and second.
B005LAII62|5.0|I love this movie, it has a great story line and I would reccomend it to any cartoon lover and family collector! I had no expectations but it really won my approval!! This movie made me laugh and cry the perfect mix of emotional pull on the heart! Enjoy the movie folks!!
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Through-out Fiona Apple's sixteen year career she's shown tremendous growth between albums.  But Idler Wheel feels like the album she was born to make.  I've been an avid fan since 2000 and this is the first album of she's released that I adored instantly.  It's strange because it's certainly her barest and quirkiest to date.  With most tracks stripped to piano, percussion, and ambient sound, I can understand why there are detractors.  I just happen to think they're off the mark.  On the track &#34;Anything We Want&#34; Apple has never sounded more loving, with &#34;Every Single Night&#34; she's at her most confessional, in &#34;Regret&#34; she's shows true rage.  (To the point you hear her sigh and slam the lid of her piano).  For Apple who's built a career on honesty The Idler Wheel is her most visceral to date, and that's saying something.
B007L5LD9O|3.0|There's a lot to like in this movie, including Jeremy Northam's Mr. Knightly, but Gwyneth Paltrow looked like the simpering, over-dramatic lead in a high school production.  And casting Toni Collette as Harriet Smith was just... wrong.  Also, there was continuity issues, especially around the climatic proposal scene, where Emma's hairstyle changes with each camera shot, that were distracting.  Otherwise, the scenery and costumes were nice.  If you like costume dramas anyway (as I do) you'll probably like it, otherwise, meh.

B003G4W49C|4.0|An amazingly crafted book with a great plot line,good description of characters, and exquisite duel scenes. The only thing I didn't like was that ender seemed to fall unconscious a lot so the story started to drag as it described the time that passed while he was sleeping. other than that it would be five stars. props to Orson for making such an almost perfect book.Sorry about my user name,don't know what happened there...
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This story read like a string of fantasy tropes and came off like a re-hash of Magician. It had as many plot twists as a George R. R. Martin dust-jacket.
B00821OX98|4.0|Good show. Season pulls you right in. I'm always happy for something with a fairly original plot and that isnt reality TV. Show has some mystery, decent action, and for a TV show pretty good effects.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The book wonder was the best book i read all year.I really like how they explain what August face looked like without pictures at the end or anything. And how they explain alot of detail on what was going on. I absolutely loved  the book.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was my favorite book of 2012.  Colleen Hoover is a master storyteller.<br />This story will have you remembering the fun of flirting and discovering you ate in love, and then make you cry, scream and shout and marvel in the strength of the main characters.<br />This story has very mature content but it is not told in an inappropriate manner.  I love Sky and Holder!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie really followed the book and included the good parts and the rough parts .. without changing the story.

140006922X|5.0|Great book which details the historical facts about a man we tend to deify but forget was a man. Zealot discusses the world in which Jesus was born, raised, and eventually died in. There is great detail given to the political, religious, and social landscape of the time which helps to understand not only Jesus but the origins of Christianity.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|For about twenty dollars you will receive one screen protector plus an assortment of other items that are intended to make it \\"easy\\" to apply the screen protector without bubbles, lint, etc.  After my completely frustrating experience with this product I felt compelled to immediately warn off other people who could possibly waste their money as I did.  First off, for the price you should get about four screen protectors, not one.  Second, the application process involves dribbling or spraying a mysterious liquid all over your hands and the screen protector itself.  You then need to try to position the dripping protector squarely on the screen of your device, using your thoroughly scrubbed but slippery finger tips, without introducing any dust or debris -- a remarkably difficult task, especially if you have to cut the item to fit your screen as I did.  (I have an iphone 5 and the only protector available was the universal size which I had to cut to fit.)  I actually tried this a second time thinking my technique just needed some practice, but got similar results.  If you have the patience of Job, and if you live in a hermetically sealed dust-proof laboratory, and if you don't really care if the item is put on straight, and if you don't mind wasting a trip to the store and then throwing $20 away, then give it a try!

B00932AA5G|5.0|awesome movie, fun to watch ! One of the best in a long time. I was entertained from the very beginning until the last second.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|A movie about psychological impact of drugs, full of complicated human relations, unexpected events and continuous agony.<br />Social psychology applied in real life situations, including a view of how mental health institutions work.
1451673442|5.0|I couldn't believe how quickly I received this book and I didn't have to pay extra shipping cost for it.  I have all of the secret books and I love them..This sure has helped me through my ruff times and keeps me with hope.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I would describe this show as part legal drama slash political thriller/drama/saga. It demonstrates moral and ethical dilemmas and how they function within our criminal justice and political decision. Alicia Florrick, the central character, is identifiable and realisitc — when she's sad, you want to hug her ... and when she's happy and victorious, you want to celebrate with her. Great show.
B002ZBZNPO|5.0|This album is great everyone should listen to it; Amy lee's voice is wonderful and the band's songs are killer.  If you're not listening to this you're missing out big time.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Ill be honest I was never really interested in seeing this movie until I was really bored on a Sunday night. I was actually sucked in immediately. I thought it was well done and the actress who play Melanie/Wanda was adorably captivating. I would watch again!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I thought it would be stupid but it is really addicting and awesome!<br />You should really get this game and you will not be able to stop playing it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Slow start but then I couldn't put it down.  Characters in story easy to understand, well explained. Left me thinking about it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great show! It has interesting cases, the relationships are fun, and the work place is a great mix of humor: I just LOVE Donna and don't you just love to hate Louis!! It is the perfect mid-week escape! It is a show that make you look forward to the next season!
B008VN9XMY|5.0|One of the best historical novels ever.  Amends, with clarity, the erroneous history written by the Tudor historians, including Shakespeare. Richard III was no hunch backed ogre, but a strong king for his times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much my siblings love it so much too it's like you have your very own horse very funn
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have a difficult time suspending disbelief, so I was immediately put off when I found out this book was narrated via a dog's voice. HOWEVER, I became fully involved in the story from the first page. This metafiction is a sweet, simple story not too sentimental, but definitely moving. Have a box of tissues on hand.
0321784421|4.0|This item was sent as a gift off of a customer's wish list. I have no opinion on the quality of this item.
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|I couldn't even finish watching this movie. I know mankind is capable of unspeakable horrors against each other, but this type of movie is too much for me to enjoy. People as depicted in this movie are criminally insane. This is not entertainment for me'
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It is a fun game ,it's very interesting and it is a learning experience for kids .I enjoyed it very much
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Forced to give a star in order to review, but this doesn't deserve even one.  I NEVER review, just figure things may just not be my cup of tea....  The old app was functional there when you needed it , could have used a refresh button but otherwise solid.  Apparently the developers haven't heard the phrase \\"if it ain't broke, don't break it...\\"
B005544TRQ|5.0|Nice mix between balancing personal and office life. In reality, it's a moving target with a lot of gray areas in between. Ultimately it's the individual that makes personal choices based on his own values in life. We prioritize the importance of many events and count our winnings and loses. After the champagne celebration or regret and sobs, we move on learning our lessons, making new freinds and dropping the losers. Ultimately we settle down as we reach the twilight of our years, we yearn to simplify our past hectic life and stick to activities and people we deeply care about.
B005LAII80|5.0|One of the best movies to come out in 2012. I wish I could have seen it in the theather.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is awesome. It is lots of fun and I would suggest it for all ages. I have  a blast playing. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it is very difficult to gain coins which can be essential but that is only a Minot problem the game is great.
0756686970|5.0|I bought the used version for my 6 year old twins who are star wars nuts. They carry it around like a bible.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|This film delivered what you'd expect from the GI Joe world. Plenty of outrageous to go with the story, just a fun time spent with your popcorn!
B005PZ857K|5.0|One of their best season's ever, due to the Reid and Maeve storyline. I fell in love with this show all over again this season
B00DU74U74|4.0|This movie was interesting. A bit better than other films in this genre. The complications of the alien and human interaction made the movie interesting.<br /><br />The idea of an alien overpowering a human's consciousness and running the human's body is not new. This is akin to demon possession where the demon is actually kind and considerate. Not a likely scenario if the alien was a demon.
B00821OX98|5.0|One of the best shows I've ever seen, it's far more like an extended movie than a basic TV series. The effects are fantastic, storyline is amazing. A must watch!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I wasn't sure about all the hoopla from this series until I started watching and got hooked right away!  I cannot wait for the 4th season to start!
B0064W65UM|5.0|V for Vendetta blows my mind, I have never read anything like this. It is just so outstandingly different from what I expect from a normal comic book and in my opinion it is borderlined literature status. V for Vendetta is my favorite graphic novel of all time. Yes it beats Kravens Last Hunt just by a little bit. Honestly at first I thought the plot was a little silly, there are so many stories like it, but V for Vendetta is so well written and different enough that it kept me engaged throughout the entire thing. I am not even going to tell you what the story is about. The way I experienced it was that I bought it at my local comic stop because I simply heard it was good and knew nothing about it, to me that was the best way to experience this novel. It is such a great mystery story full of twists and turns and so many \\"scenes\\" that are just....beautiful in delivery. Again V for Vendetta is my favorite comic book/Graphic Novel of all time, it is simply worth the buy
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I'm always leery of a movie that is produced by the star. I think they're looking more to cash in on their name and stay in front of the camera then to really make a good movie. For the most part, though, I thought Jack Reacher was a decent flick. Cruise seems intent on 2 things with this movie: to look taller than everyone else and to show he's still in shape for a 50 yr old guy.<br /><br />The basic premise was just that..basic but they threw in a minor twist that added some flare. Overall not a waste of time to watch. It's a shoot 'em up movie with a little bit of good detective work on the part of Reacher.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I liked the way how the writer gives insights from his life and motivates to think different. Somehow motivating and provides some tools how...<br />Are you willing to change or in a phase of changing then read this book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Becomes habit forming. It's always handy with great ease of use. Love I use this app more than most others in the game category. Love it. Helps avoid stress.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love minions and this game is so much fun. I recommend this game for anyone. I just wish I was better at it lol.
B008XG1X18|5.0|A website that provides awesome ideas when you need them and a place to share with friends and post your own found ideas.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was a phenomenal ending to one of the greatest epic stories of our time.  It's been nearly a decade since I stumbled upon the first book.  There have been ups and downs.  Times when I tired of some of the repetitiveness in the writing and needed to take a break.  But curiosity always brought me back, wanting to know how it would all end.  I struggled through The Gathering Storm- honestly, I felt it was terrible, I had to force myself to finish it.. But thanks to reviews of Towers of Midnight, I decided to keep going with the series, and was glad I did.  Towers of Midnight was excellent.  When A memory of Light was finally out I delayed picking it up right away.  I tried to decide if a bad ending would be worse than never reading the ending.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to risk being thoroughly disappointed with no hope for a redeeming sequel since this was really it.. the end of the series.  Two days ago I finally decided to buy it.  I couldn't put it down.  I laughed and cried through it.  I think Robert Jordan would be so proud.  I loved how it was ended.  I loved that the reader is given time to slowly, properly, say goodbye to the characters that have become our friends after all these years.  The battle was truly epic- just so expansive, so incredible.  I won't ruin it for you.  Read this, if you haven't yet!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|A wonderful, and inspiring read for anyone. Whether you're interested in psychology or struggling to find your way, I think everyone should read this book.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another great Baldacci!  Good luck trying to put it down before you are finished.  Once you must, immediately start reading his next book, &#34;The Hit.&#34;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed season 3 almost as much as the previous seasons, however I wasn't prepared for the last episode at all!!  Very SHOCKING to say the least!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Thoughtfully presented and interesting view of the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth written by a very qualified scholar able to express his thesis in everyday terms. A must read for those of all religions.
B000004166|5.0|This is a nice collection of Mozart Violin Concerto's. Fun to listen to while doing anything. Some of Mozart's music at its best. I would highly recommend this 2 CD collection!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I've only played 2 levels so far and its been good. challenging enough so far. nice graphics and items are not super easy to find...takes some thinking.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this film but thought, hey with Jude Law and Catherine Zeta Jones, how can you go wrong.  Glad I tried this film.  I really enjoyed it.  There are plenty of twists and turns and some very unexpected love scenes.  Hmmm. gotta see it now, right?  I highly recommend it.
B005LF9IO8|4.0|I like conspiracy type stories in general but I felt this was one of the best titles out that year. It's a good watch and will keep you interested through the entire movie but not too hard to follow either.
B00000269M|5.0|This is some of Michael Jackson's finest music. Some slower and some faster more rhythmic songs. You will enjoy adding this CD to your musical CD collection. I highly recommend this CD!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very classy production - wife found it thru a friend and got me hooked on it.  We had a marathon viewing session and caught up on season 1 & 2.  Wish we didn't have to wait till January for season 4!
B005FISC52|5.0|very nice.  It is as advertised and in very good shape.  Outer box was a bit crushed but inside box was okay.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is possibly the most addicting game out there right now- I could play it all day! Love it so much
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|fun loved it you will too.  keeper see you on the next mystery game.  loved the paint puzzle fun fun fun
B0022W6L6G|5.0|The music is gereat, fantastic and I enjoy listening to the songs during work and the dirve inthe car to and from work
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|As many have already pointed out, this novel falls on the short side.<br /><br />The story is relatively simple. No convoluted twists or complexities.<br /><br />I would not recommend this with great  praise but it's a well written touching short story.
B0018BF1JA|5.0|everything ok, recomendable, all new no problem very recomndable very good<br />stay soon thanks ok see you lateres fantastic buy again
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Very enjoyable,  it takes a little getting used to, but overall it just takes some common sense to figure out. A nice way to pass some time  and keeps you thinking. If you like to be challenged you will find this interesting.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|written very well. I would like to see the movie. Very enjoyable reading. I would recommend it to anyone. Not what I expected.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|WOW - this is a book you will only want to start when you have plenty of time because you won't want to put it down.  Written from an interesting perspective.  Had I know it was about pre Nazi Germany, I probably would not have read it so I am glad I did not know and went on the recommendation of a friend.  This is a book not to be missed.
B006UISWB0|5.0|everything ok, recomendable, all new no problem very recomndable very good<br />stay soon thanks ok see you lateres fantastic buy again
B000FA675C|4.0|I would highly recommend this book as an excellent book. It kept me turning the pages anxious to read what happens next. I would not take any of thus information a  absolute fact and would do my own research about the frail and all of the symbology
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It was fun at first but then it got pretty BORING its up to you but i say it not worth the storage .
B0076DELIG|4.0|They just keep getting better and better.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Black Box!  It has a great story line and great characters.
B00004YTIQ|3.0|By looking at the picture, it looks like it fits snug and looks like a thick plastic, but it sags really bad in the middle and is pretty thin. When it rains, the middle fills up with water and then the whole thing falls into the pool. Having 2 people pull and stretch it at the same time helps a little, but still not as flat as the picture.<br /><br />On a good note, even with high winds, the cover stays on.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Works great with no noticeable problems. Very useful app and id recommend it for anyone who has trouble with normal youtube
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Downton Abbey is just the kind of series I enjoy most.  I have really enjoyed watching each and every disc.  My only complaint is the condition of the cases containing the discs.  They were torn and taped over with scotch tape.  Instead of looking brand new, they looked like second hand, used merchandise.  And I certainly didn't pay a second hand, used price for the set.  For this reason, I will probably NOT buy from Amazon again.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|it is really cool pie people play poop up in my house weed is bad girl go to my yo head up
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I couldn't stop reading. Loved the story line and following the lives of these people and learning their history. It came full circle.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|it was very hard to discern the tiles as the display was sorely lacking a 3D appearance........<br /><br />Otherwise the graphics were beautiful.
B00000634J|1.0|When you are one of the most loved pop musicians in history and yet your twenty-songs greatest hits album contains quite a lot of filler, something is definitely wrong.<br /><br />And it's not hard to figure it out. Lennon was a polarizing character, a perennial maker of front page news, and a wannabe revolutionary (to his credit, he had the courage to admit he hadn't change anything) but most of all he was a mediocre musician. He did write some beautiful songs, quite a few forgettable ones, and a whole lot of utter trash. This is accurately reflected in his Greatest Hits. Even some who gave this album rave reviews admit they skipped over some of the songs because they don't remember them -they are fillers in a top hits compilation.<br /><br />Old coots like me who lived through the Beatles and post Beatles period remember too well that, after 1975's Rock and Roll (just a covers album), he was pretty much forgotten. No records, no tours, nobody wanted to play with him, while the much reviled Sir Paul nailed hit after hit, although the critics labeled him \\"commercial candy\\". Many years after, Paul's post Beatles career includes a boatload of amazing songs, and new generations still love them. Now ask any contemporary (or old, for that matter) listener how many Lennon songs he/she knows and loves other than Imagine.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|There are a couple of intro/acoustic tracks between songs. But overall this album is a 5 star. It sounds a lot like &#34;This is war&#34; and continues on the sound they created for that album. I listen to this almost daily.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|My family and I really enjoyed Chasing Mavericks. The acting was good and it has the right amount of action, sports, and story.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Really enjoy the series and the characters.  The selection of characters for the parts are a great match to the script.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I love this show and I love the way you can play with subtitles using this service.  Sometimes reading what folks are saying is illuminating on this series.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|This is a Maggie Smith classic grouchy elderly lady character.  Nearly everyone in the movie is a very talented, well-established (read older) musician or actor.  I envy Dustin Hoffman working around all that musical/theatrical talent.  and the music ... well, fantastic.  There was a very brief nod to rap, but, if you don't like classical music, you may not like the movie.  I loved it.  But I grew up with my mom wrapping the house in classical music.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Google has Ben really helpful on my kindle HD fire!:D I love it a lot even when it's bugy ( so what?) But I've Ben having a mager problem!0_0<br /><br />So I'm addicted to Youtube I don't have a account but I love watching vids! ;) so today I went on youtube to look at a video that my friend showed on hers and MY kindle but the funny thing was that youtube changed 0_o (like badly) on my kindle I was so confused when it said I couldn't  watch the video because it wasn't made to be watched on my kindle! 0_0? But I watched it on my kindle like two days ago? WHAT THE HECK? I told my mom and she said either youtube is next up or it up grated or something is wrong with Google I'm not shore if this is only happening to me? 0_0 (PLZ REPLY!)
B00BSBUZT6|1.0|The show is interesting, but I felt completely side-swiped when I was watching it with my elementary school-aged boys and footage of a closeup of a fully naked woman crossed the screen with no warning or topical preface. Give me a fickin' break! I'm sorry, but if you're going to have nudity, post a warning.<br /><br />Needless to say, my kids didn't watch the rest. But what was even the point?! It was completely gratuitous, and, as a matter of fact, not even isolated -- there was more later.<br /><br />I have dozens of classic rock-related titles, and this is the first time I've encountered this sort of thing. Not at all expected.<br /><br />I'm rating it one star to reflect the lack of class and the lack of courtesy on the part of the producers. I haven't watched the post-breakup documentary yet, but the pre-breakup disc and the concert disc are both good.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Sean Patrick has done a satisfactory job, describing much of the unsung hero, Tesla`s, great inventions and ideas. A well written book for anyone interested to take a brief glimpse in the life of Tesla and how his ideas changed the world.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very sad to have read the last in the series.  Good characters and they all left me wanting the next one.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|the app itself is very simple and organized. I love that you can see events in the monthly calendar setting! the color coding option is the icing on the cake. it even OFFERS to put on national holidays, but you dont have to! I really like this app, only reason it doesn't get five stars: the type is pretty small and the end of some words get cut off so events can fit into one calendar day.-only in the monthly setting. otherwise........4.8 stars
B001D08CRY|5.0|Excellent recipes! However I haven't figured out how to share them or email them to my computer so I can print them
B007VUA7VO|5.0|While it is certainly possible to write a long positive review on this app, is it really necessary to explain that the app works, is quite handy for monitoring battery charge on both phones and Fire and it is free. Just doesn't get much better than that!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I continued to like the Crossfire Series and Sylvia Day did not disappoint.  There was more than romance involved in the series.  Looking forward to the next book.
B00005N56Y|5.0|This pair of discs brings together five of the legendary Mozart concerto performances, somewhat reluctantly approved of for publication by Curzon. Curzon was at the same time, a recording artist of choice but also a recording nightmare commercially. There are many of his recordings still in the vaults that were made at considerable expense, but which were then refused permission for publication by Curzon for reasons that few would consider essential.<br /><br />As a result of these exacting requirements, his available recorded legacy is not as extensive as it might otherwise be and so these five concertos have achieved rarity value as well as musical value. Curzon brings a fastidious mind to bear on these works which work seamlessly with the chosen conductors and their joint views on performance. It is possible to find in these performances musical links that extend beyond the specific concertos themselves. This type of intellectual extension was typical of Curzon who was rarely satisfied with the results, always feeling that there was yet more to be revealed or explored in the future. Nevertheless for normal mortals these five performances have achieves artistic legendary status.<br /><br />As with the rest of these re-mastered discs, the improvement in sound quality is very marked with the greatest improvements being with the older recordings. This set falls somewhere in the middle range being of late 60's to early 70's vintage. The reality is that early CDs simply did not have the capability of containing the full musical signal which had been achieved via analogue recordings since the 1950's. An example of convenience over substance similar to camera phones relative to good quality 'traditional' digital cameras and mp3 players compared to separates and large speakers etc. That backwards sonic move has now been rectified with the much greater capabilities of these higher bit rate transfers.<br /><br />As a result there is greater dynamic range, tonal range, sound-stage and general 'presence' to be readily heard. The better the replay equipment the more this will be apparent.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest that for those considering an upgrade to this new mastering, this disc clearly offers significant improvement. For those yet to experience Curzon's playing, this set would be an excellent place to start and well worth considering on that basis. The 26th concerto is split between the discs but this seems to be a very small price of inconvenience to pay in order to enjoy an extra concerto.-stage and general 'presence' to be readily heard.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Although dissimilar to other Ken Follett novels, the trilogy links many families from Wales, US, England, Germany, and Russia thru the exciting 20th century.

B0013WJGJ0|5.0|When we think of film in 1989, most think of Batman.<br /><br />This film started a movement, and while others say cheesy Dark Knight, is one of the best films in ages, I think this one is far better.  Dark Knight would have been nothing without the release of this \\"VERY FIRST\\" dark Batman film.<br /><br />There's something about Michael Keaton, as Batman, and Jack Nicholson, as the Joker, that just can't be beat with remakes.  I've watched all the Batman films, and by far, Batman 1989, is the ideal Batman film.<br /><br />Michael Keaton is the best Batman.  First off, Mike looks better in a Batman suit than any other actor, especially Christian Bale.  Mike's features are aligned to the suit, while Christian's got this thin face, that makes the rubber kind of protrude out, he appears funny, makes viewers think apparently that the gloves do not fit.  Keaton is Batman when we see him in the film.  Also Mike's personality is darker, more  intellectually savvy, and unique, than Christian Bale's attempts to fit into the character with the later Dark Knight film. Christian just can't pull off the part as good as Mike,  even though he tries hard, and in all the latest films he's just a cheesy stereotype.  Michael Keaton to me, fits the gloves of Batman, like no other actor in the history of the theme's film presentation.<br /><br />The same can also be said about Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker.  Everyone's saying Heath Ledger's Joker is the best to ever grace the screen, but when I saw Dark Knight, I was like, that guy's just reading memorized lines he knows from a script, period, and acting out the part like a stereotype.  Jack Nicholson, actually throws life into the character with his unique touch into the twisted personality, he adds a ton of glitz and makes the Joker appear more human, and more psycho in a realistic way.  He becomes the Joker like no other actor can emulate on the screen.  To me there could be no other Joker.<br /><br />There's so much of this movie that is just stellar film making, including the Joker's crashing into an art museum, his mayhem accompanied by a boombox screaming Prince music, and Batman's whisking Vicky Vale away on a harpoon rope ride, that just can't be outdone.  I was raised on this film as a kid growing up.  I looked up to Mike's representation of Batman, and from then to even now, even after all the  MANY films proceeding it, including ones that made me think, \\"Who was crazy enough to produce such one star garbage for the screen\\", there to me could not be a movie to outdo this ideal presentation of Batman.his movie that is just stellar film making, including the Joker's crashing into an art museum, his mayhem accompanied by a boombox screaming Prince music, and Batman's whisking Vicky Vale away on a harpoon rope ride, that just can't be outdone.

Everyone's saying Heath Ledger's Joker is the best to ever grace the screen, but when I saw Dark Knight, I was like, that guy's just reading memorized lines he knows from a script, period, and acting out the part like a stereotype. Jack Nicholson, actually throws life into the character with his unique touch into the twisted personality, he adds a ton of glitz and makes the Joker appear more human, and more psycho in a realistic way. He becomes the Joker like no other actor can emulate on the screen. To me there could be no other Joker.<br /><br />There's so much of the 1989 film that is just stellar film making, including the Joker's crashing into an art museum, his mayhem accompanied by a boombox screaming Prince music, and Batman's whisking Vicky Vale away on a harpoonrope ride, that just can't be outdone. I was raised on this film as a kid growing up. I looked up to Mike's representation of Batman, and from then to even now, even after all the MANY films proceeding it, including ones that made me think, \\"Who was crazy enough to produce such one star garbage for the screen\\", there to me could not be a movie to outdo 1989's Batman.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What an unexpected surprise.  This is a creative, unique and engaging story.  Read for book club and so glad I did - highly recommend!
0060531053|5.0|Recommended as the best resource material for home brewing and written by the master.  If you are going to try home brew this book is a must.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Thanks to Fox News, I'll never have to read another book in my life. I'll just rely on the hard-hitting reporting of third runner up Miss America contestants. She says this guy is Muslim so obviously, he doesn't have a friggen clue about Christianity! In spite of his own time as a Christian, or the fact that he's married to a Christian, or has several degrees in  Religious Studies, this guy is Satan's handbag on lay-away!<br /><br />Five stars because this book is the spawn of the debil!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I`'ve always been interested in the life of Tesla. An unbelievable talent that, compared to Edison, is largely forgotten. This short book gives a great overview of the background of his life and his incredible drive and determination to succeed. It always makes me wonder what he could have achieved with real support. This is a great intro.
B008D19WBQ|2.0|Ok, I just got this box sex after being told these were the original NBC broadcast episodes. You should know that they are NOT. Just one example, season 7, The One Where Rosita Dies, the opening after-credits scene in the coffee house is cut. The conversation with Ross and Chandler about how Chandler will have to introduce Ross as his brother-in-law rather than his friend, and the end of the scene where Ross calls his dad about the house and asks \\"who did you leave a message with\\" and Chandler taps on the window and says \\"sorry\\" and runs off. Other scenes are truncated all throughout the episode and at the epilogue when Joey and Rachel are sitting in the new chair contentedly and Joey says \\"mmmm???\\" and Rachel says \\"mm-mmm\\" that part's cut out, too. Some episodes are complete, but a good many of them are cut short from the original NBC airings. Very disappointing that this is the case. The original NBC broadcasts, the episodes as we first loved them, as they first aired, it seems, are gone for good.
B008CP92ZO|5.0|This movie is definitely not for children under 17, it is however hilarious for older adults it was very funny.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|graphics are good i wish there was more places to go, otherwise a fun short game. hope there are some add ons
0770437400|2.0|A total ripoff of Sir John Hackett's \\"World War 3:  August 1985\\".<br /><br />Substitute 'zombie' for 'commie'....and you'll have to admit that Brooks is a plagurist.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|As others seem to gravitate to extreme verbosity while reviewing, I'll be brief. This was an amazing ride. Non stop action from the opening sequence to the final scene. It has everything. Great story, great characters, great villians, great special FX, humor, comradarie, grief, loss and of course, the Enterprise. The only gripe I have is it became a little fatiguing as they continued to encounter even tougher challenges at each turn but it was very fun to watch them overcome. This new cast is the epitome of who these characters are. All of them are excellent choices (even though Bones is a little bit of a stretch). Lets hope it doesnt take 4 more years to put up another rip roaring adventure because I want to see more of these people playing these parts. Oh, and even though this is a great movie in its own right, Kirks \\"KAAAAAHHHHHHHNNNNNN\\" was much better in the original ST2. To JJ Abrahms and whoever helms the new movies that are sure to come, live long and prosper.
B005WQ4QW0|4.0|this movie is definitely worth having in your collection, If you are a fan of De Niro I highly recommend watching this.
B00CATSONE|5.0|If you want to know a little about a great inventor read this book. It also lets you know a little about how much of a scumbag Edison and his friend JP Morgan are. If Tesla would not have been hindered at almost every stage by Edison and Morgan, the world would be farther ahead technologically speaking. What really surprised me was how Tesla handled himself. I do not think I would have let so much go without retribution. The man was a true genius and a wonderful human.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I got this app for my Kindle and it's really big.  Nice to have something I don't have to squint to see and easy to hit the buttons.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Ok, so it seems that most people here feel the need to be very verbose in their reviews. I will spare you then. This movie was one heck of a ride. Between Pepper donning the suite to save Tony at his mansion to Pepper once again donning (at least part) of the suit to save him on the docks, we have some of the most fun a person can have at a movie. While I felt a little cheated by the Mandarin reveal and I felt some of the effects in the scenes with all of the suits flying around were a little pedestrian, this is a story about Tony Stark and what it means to be a hero. 2 thumbs up, way up. Its a shame RDJ is getting older because like Hugh Jackman and the Wolverine, I simply cant see anyone else in the part.
034544678X|5.0|Clear some misinterpretation about how dogs learn. All the trainings and dog behaviour problems are very well detailed. A great book that teach us how to understand dogs and avoid every kind of violence in the training.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|If you like not to chalinging games this is yours its very addicting and fun<br />So you might want this game but im not you but if i were i would get it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I gave up cable a while ago and watch most of my TV through Netflix. I also have all my music on Google play. So you can imagine my excitement when this was announced. It fits right into most of the products I use and was a no brainer purchase. Easy to setup, works with relatively few hiccups for being a beta product. For me it is already worth the $35 dollars and then some. The fact that as more companies update their products to support it it should get better is just icing on the cake for me.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|I watched season 3 first, now I'm starting from the beginning with season 1&2. I can't wait for season 4!
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game! ment for all ages  this game is CRAZY addictive theres a reason why this game has aLOT of users cause like the title says its AWESOMENESS!!
074401493X|5.0|This book is more for Collector's then people who need help. There's a cheaper one that's only $20, I recommend that one more.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Honestly, if you haven't watch this movie go watch it now, and if you have, go watch it again. Great pacing, characters, action and story. I remember watching it in theaters for the first time, and this blue ray version does not disappoint. Grab a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy one of the greatest superhero movies ever.
0307389839|5.0|I'm a fan of Marukami's fiction, and also a new runner. I loved this. A great read for runners. I loved finding that an author I admire and I have a lot in common when it comes to running.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This has to be one of my now favorite kids movies. I think my 6 year old and I went around 'blah blah blah'ing each other for a few weeks. Fun for both adults and the kids... but don't be ashamed to watch it without them. =)
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|If you played The Last of Us, then you should be in love the Joel and Ellie. The music added so much affect to that game, and it's really relaxing.
0553573403|5.0|Read the book. Seriously.<br /><br />Awesomeness. Only complaint is that it's not the sort of book that you can dip your toes into - difficult to approach if you have a busy schedule. But SO WORTH IT.
B00688628M|5.0|Best WWII series I have seen!! Highly recommend it! Great acting and action . So informative and really keeps your attention throughout!
B009OYSFDM|4.0|The start of this season to me was fresh and strong. Towards the end the actor was becoming predictable. He didn't seem to grow any. Hopefully in season 2 he'll be a bit more dynamic. Worth the watch though.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|fun for everyone love how easy it is to learn and play...everyone in this house loves playing...so easy my four yr old can play it
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I bought this several months ago and still works incredibly fine. I can do whatever I want and i can't reach the forth core. Recommendation for gamers PC's.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Has a little bit of language but good book I wish it had a little bit more detail on some of his shots but it was an awesome book
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig has proven to be such a solid Bond with Skyfall. The Blu-ray completes the empty slot from my James Bond 50 Boxset. Such a solid edition to the Bond legacy!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thought this was a fun game for children maybe older ones because of the slight difficulty&middot;&hellip;the only problem I had was getting tokens. But other wise it was quite fun.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book as much as his other novels. The way that he captured this feeling of something missing in Pari is amazing!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This was a very good book, and the social problems addressed are as present today in every nation as in 17th century France. The characters were realistic and the storyline compelling if rather depressing. The only critique I'd submit is to a tendency to go off on tangents that rambled on for many chapters and at times made it difficult to focus on the story.
1932100660|5.0|This is a book with lots of good information.It helps you to live a better healthier life.I recommend this book to everyone.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It is great to pass time but feel you are helping endangered animals or even extinct animals if only for fun<br />Wsparks7@verizon
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I find the hooky special effect much more entertaining than the high-cost effects of latter series.  However, the packaging was a good example of excess consumerism.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|I credit two films in particular with endearing me toward robots and robot movies.  One would be the original \\"Star Wars,\\" with its lovable duo of R2D2 and C3P0.  The other would be a certain cult-classic film with an adorable malfunctioning robot... \\"Short Circuit.\\"  These movies didn't just show off their technical prowess by creating robots that looked like actual robots instead of cheap puppets, but they imbued them with personality, making them every bit as three-dimensional and personable as the human actors... and oftentimes more likable.<br /><br />While \\"Short Circuit\\" isn't a cinematic classic like \\"Star Wars\\" and its accompanying franchise, it's a fun and cute movie in its own right.  And its robot character is a lot of fun.<br /><br />Number Five is one of a set of prototype robots developed by Newton, a reclusive scientist, for use on the battlefield.  A lightning strike scrambles Number Five's circuits and gives him something his fellow prototypes don't have... a personality, and a sense of truly being alive.  He escapes the laboratory, causing a panic among the scientists and military when they realize he's still armed with a powerful laser.  Number Five eventually ends up in the care of Stephanie, a feisty animal-loving caterer who first mistakes him for an alien, but comes to realize that even if he's manmade he's still sentient.  But with the military desperate to stop Number Five at any cost, even if it means destroying him, Stephanie must convince Newton that Number Five is truly alive before the unthinkable happens.<br /><br />While the special effects of this film might look somewhat cheesy today, they were quite good for their time.  And in a way, using puppetry and real robots for this film give it a sense of realism that modern CGI just can't duplicate.  Number Five manages to be quite expressive, communicating his emotions and thoughts via posture, eye color, and a rather mobile set of \\"eyebrows.\\"<br /><br />The acting in this film, while not spectacular, is decent enough that I never felt jarred out of the movie by a bad acting job.  Steve Gutenberg and Ally Sheedy are rather good as Newton and Stephanie respectively, and to this day I have a hard time seeing them as anything besides Newton and Stephanie.  They actually have a decent on-screen chemistry, and while Gutenberg can get goofy at times, it's understandable given that his character is more comfortable around robots than people.  GW Bailey hams it up as Skroeder, the military officer who wants Number Five dead, and while Fisher Stevens has raised some controversy as Ben (the actor is white while the character is Indian), he was fun and hilarious in my opinion.<br /><br />Warning for parents -- this film has some mild profanity and a few genuinely scary moments, including a \\"war game\\" scene in the beginning and a couple of shootouts.  Parents might want to screen this movie before letting their children watch, as every child's tolerance level for on-screen action violence is different.<br /><br />By turns cute, exciting, and hilarious, \\"Short Circuit\\" is a must-see for fans of '80s cinema, and anyone who enjoys a good robot movie.  Recommended for ages 10 and up.ot spectacular, is decent enough that I never felt jarred out of the movie by a bad acting job.

B00BB8Q13A|5.0|I was very surprised at how much we enjoyed the movie. I thought it was going to be slow but it kept our attention through the entire time.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Hosseini draws you in and gives insight ti life in Afghanistan.  Deep characters who make you think about the Afghan culture, a life so different from America.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thought the book had a much better development of the characters and set a more intriguing and realistic portrait of life with severe depression.  I enjoyed the book more thatn the movie, as I thought the movie plot was obviously manipulated for mass movie pleasure.
B00B32YK96|5.0|Very realistic movie about relationships between men and women, or should I say boys and women, since that is what applies here.  Even though most of the characters in the movie are already physically adults, it could still be termed a coming of age movie.<br />Well written, acted, etc.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Trust me, watch it, you'll love it! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman make a fantastic duo. A fresh take on a classic.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|This made a great gift.  My sister loved it.  She has worn out 2 others.  Great service, delivery and packaging & quality service overall  Movie celebrates youth, music & song!!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is a toy.  A very snazzy one, but still a toy.  If you expect a toy, you will be very happy with this purchase.  Noise is cool, UV pen & light work just great.
B008RKGF1I|4.0|Not very rooted in reality, had some issues with character development, but the music and dancing are fun.<br />It's one of those movies I feel a bit embarrassed to enjoy, yet I have seen it at least 3 times in the last 20 odd years.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I don't like the recent changes. I prefer the last version.<br />I think it was better organized and I don't like having so many things in my way. I just want to get the info I want and only that info.
B009AMANBA|5.0|The advantages of watching this film on a DVD are: If there are parts of the film that are difficult to understand, you can always rewind and watch them over. I found that to be necessary, in this film, which is low on action but has plenty of talking, Lincoln has to talk with a lot of people to convince his aids and congress that it is a good time to emancipate the slaves. Plus the obvious advantage of watching this film at a time of your own choosing or watching it in episodes if necessary.<br /><br />If you are interested in the trials and tribulations of Lincoln, the man and the president, then this film is for you.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Really enjoyable show. Recommend to anyone wanting to 'get away from it all'! The acting and writing is top notch.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Despite trying not to judge a book by it's cover, this one grabbed my attention.  From the start the theme was quirky, fast paced and gave moments of apprehension that provided just the right amount of thrills to hold me, the reader, in the moment.  I read this book really quickly and enjoyed the seemingly effortless writing style that took me through ridiculous situations - that would defy belief - except it all felt so right.  Clever and imaginative combinations of characters and locations that were easy to visualise, taking no time for the reader to just be in the picture effortlessly.  Loose ends were tied up, the connections seemingly unrelated all came together and overall it was a satisfying read.  It has left a lasting impression on me and I will read it again - a clear sign of a good book! If you are looking for escapism (which is the theme) and something light hearted and out of the ordinary then this is the book for you.
B00124PXW8|5.0|Just watched it again on amazon and truly enjoyed it.<br />The story is simple, making the movie natural and believable.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is just fun.  when ever my minion giggles I chuckle and that's the point isn't it? great entertainment.  I would have given it a 5 but it freezes every now and then on my kindle.  it just is that much fun that freezing up can be ignored.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I really enjoy this game because I have an opportunity to play as opposed to some jewel games that give one minute.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|After reading Fall of Giants, I hardly could wait for the second volume. When finally arrived I immediatly started to read. The story line still good, interesting, sometimes it is very obvious. Anyway, it is a good history book for millions who are not ready to read real history.
160774273X|5.0|Ken Forkish present an excelent overview about artisan bread. He inspire me to start my family own bakery. Thanks for all your advices
B00DW3GFCY|5.0|Thank you for allowing me to buy this version of Tora! Tora! Tora!.  It is worth buying in the HD version
B00BU2VSNU|5.0|I owned this album when it first came out and I'm so happy to have it again. In a day when 'music' is defined as an overwhelming beat, no melody, auto-tuning the vocal and few if any actual lyrics, we're given a re-issue of an album featuring outstanding songwriting, memorable lyrics and melodies, a natural voice, and musicians who actually know how to play musical instruments. If you ignored this release back in the 90s and have yet to experience it, give it a listen. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Im 13 and me and my little brother love this game!! I really recommend it! Great for times when you are bored and stuff!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Love this book...as a Muslim, it give me new perspective towards Christianity and the new testament. Love Reza Aslan books
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I am a true fan of the Moody's music.  And Justin Hayward's voice is as beautiful as it ever was.  Thanks to Amazon for making this available.  Keep the Moody's music coming.  And LOVE to Justin Hayward!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I'm not usually an action fan, but watched this at a request of a friend before seeing RED2.  I'm also not a Bruce Willis fan, but he has the same charm and timing he did in this film as he did in his &#34;Moonlighting&#34; days.  John Malkovich is at his hilariously insane best, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren.....well, who needs to say anything about them!  Mary Louise Parker plays the requisite female interest, and is very good in slowly coming around to the RED way of thinking.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.
B00B3YLI8U|4.0|This mysterious Victorian melodrama has so many twists and turns that it will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Collins was a contemporary of Charles Dickens, although younger than the great Boz. He was for a while Dickens' prodigy but they later fell out. While Dickens often spoke disparagingly of his young rival, he was not averse to stealing a few ideas from Collins, not least for his own unfinished 'Mystery of Edwin Drood'.<br /><br />Some readers may find the narrative structure of this novel difficult to get used to. Each character speaks in turn, picking up the narrative 'baton'. It works though.<br /><br />Moreover, for a Victorian novelist, Collins treats women with greater understanding and sympathy than ever the great Charles Dickens did so, girls, read it for that reason if nothing else!
B000I9YWDO|4.0|I don't laugh easily but definitely chuckled at the preposterous routines and office encounters we all have experienced. Had some tears of sadness for those caught in &#34;the rut&#34;, including myself. So I found it to be an eye opener... to go fishing!
B001LMAK88|3.0|Villain heavy and especially star heavy.  Scott Glenn and Kevin Kline give standout performances.  Some actors showboat and others are dull.  The clothes, exteriors, and interiors are far too spotless, without any sign of wear, dust, or grime.  Give me \\"High Noon\\", \\"Magnificent 7\\", \\"The Searchers\\", or \\"One Eyed Jacks\\" any day.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|quick and informative!!!  a must have. I use this all the time and would recommend it to any one who likes having the time and weather at a touch of a button
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I use this app often since I received it. It is powerful for those who have a need of a processor in a tablet form. I extremely recommend this product for those who just need the basics. It is every much like Mircosoft Office works almost the same so a short learning curve. I also like that its so easy to use spreadsheets. If you need a stronger verison you can buy the full version. I am retired so I do not need the full version but this is wonderful tool for those who need a word processor for small projects this is perfect
B005K17RU0|5.0|This latest version is pretty awesome. I like the addition of more detailed hourly weather and maps. Also you can see multiple locations on the map page at once
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut is an excellent author, and this book is one of his better works. I thoroughly enjoyed every page of it, and people who say that &#34;nothing happens&#34; must not have paid attention.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|It wasn't what I expected it sends you to You Tube to see how to do different levels. Then you pick witch video you want to watch.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie SO much. Thank you Amazon for getting it to me so quickly and thank you for making an essential portrayal of history available.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just the fact that you play as a minion is quiet funny already. The game play is outstanding. This game reminds me a lot of Temple Run 2&trade; and Subway Surfer&trade;. This game is very entertaining and is good to play anywhere whether you're bored on the bus or trapped inside your house.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|One of those that really pulls you in.  And one that you don't want to put down.  I'd highly recommend it!
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I bought this watch to use in preparation for my first 8K. I'm new to running and really wanted something to show me how I was doing. I've barely been able to use this watch though. I find myself unable to find what I last saw, somehow switching it to bike instead of running, unable to see the little font that I want to read and also find it very heavy on my wrist. This is a complicated watch and way too complicated for me. If you're techy and already familiar with running watches, this might do for you  but I regret spending so much money for such a complicated thing and not using it to get my return on investment.
B005P4P966|5.0|I have watched this show from the beginning.  Seen all the episodes many times and it still<br />entertains me.  Great show and cast.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Love it!!
B00CA3C1N4|3.0|Its interesting to play. Hard to beat it.  It looks pretty and I will probably keep trying to play it.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Great game just wish there were more levels available. No problem, will wait for the updates!  Plenty of websites on line to get hints if you get stuck.
B0058BI864|5.0|This has been one of my favorite shows from the beginning.  I think I know all the scripts<br />by heart.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was a fun read. I found it entertaining to read from a man's point of view. I loved the fact that he didn't realize he was in love with her.
B00AK57N00|4.0|I like the game its fun to play you don't get bored with it I would get the game yes
B008D28HYS|4.0|I have both the color and black and white versions.  Love playing this to wind down in the eve; one of the main reasons I don't get enough sleep:)  Just a few things...most have already been said by others: It's been a looooooong time since any new puzzles have been added.  I've solved, erased, and resolved all the puzzles more than once.  Some new puzzles, please!!  Does anyone have an ETA of the next release?  I check daily and have been very disappointed not to see any there.<br /><br />I agree, the random puzzles are dull. No more of them would be fine w me.<br /><br />Would like it if a future update would include a &quot;save&quot; button and a hint button, or better yet, an option to show which colors or x's are entered in error.  AD
B0042TV4IW|5.0|By far this is the most enjoyable series I have watched in years. I like Downton Abby but I absolutely love Lark Rise To Candleford. The clothing of that period is depicted well, the acting is superb, the characters have depth as revealed season by season. The challenges the two communities encounter and how they resolve them are rich and sometimes comical. I feel like I have made new friends similar to when I read a really good book then miss them when it comes to a close. I highly recommed it for the entire family. Very refreshing to get away from today's gruesome murder shows, drugs, violence, and the new \\"staged\\" reality shows.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|I have waited for a solo Phil album for a very long time and this did not disappoint!  I saw reviews all over the board for this one.  I would say this is for a grind it in your face metal head.  It has some sweet hooks and awesome lyrics.  I don't believe that any of this is \\"unpolished\\" in my opinion, it is fast but there is total clarity which is unique for a grind thrash hit you in the face speed metal machine.  It is a unique animal.  If you don't get it go buy a Nickelback album.  Actually go buy two Nickelback albums one each for where your nuts should be.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I love this game its fun to play. I have fun with it I think you will too. buy the game.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun game that is relatively easy to learn. Be careful of using up hints in the beginning, as they will make you pay for extra. But, overall I would recommend it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|great series.  discovered it late, but it's as fun to watch as the zombie series Walking dead.  Acting is great, casting great, fun to watch
080701429X|5.0|Didn't have to wait forever to get it. No marks on the book it was used, but looked new. Pleased
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and can't wait to read the other two books in this trilogy!! Very entertaining and a book you can't stop reading until you finish it!! Definitely recommend reading this book!!
B006QQ70JG|2.0|It's about a teen and a guy that fall in love with each other and run off to mate like bunnies. I didn't care for this movie and the plot .
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|In the last two days I have become both the owner of a Google Chromecast and an Apple TV. Both devices certainly have their merits, and their price points, but honestly I think only one of them is a winner. A quick word first: I own a MacBook Pro (2007, not Airplay compatible), an iPhone 5 and an iPad. The only Android device in our household, a 2012 Nexus 7, belongs to my brother who is away from home at college. Okay, with that settled, let's put these things through their paces.<br /><br />- Google Chromecast<br /><br />This $35 set-top-box-on-a-stick streamer is really a lot of great ideas in one. The problem only comes when those ideas don't, or perhaps can't, deliver. Let me start with setup. Google makes it seem like it's a one step process. Well, it's not. At least not for most people.<br /><br />* Step 1: Plug stick in TV. The Chromecast will switch your TV to the correct input and instruct you on how to configure your wifi.<br />- * Optional Step 1a: If the HDMI port on your TV is unable to connect to the Chromecast because it will not fit, connect your device to the included HDMI extender and then connect it to your TV.<br />- * Optional Step 1b: If the Chromecast does not power itself from the Plug the included USB power adapter into your Chromecast and plug it into your TV.<br />- * Optional Step 1c: If your Chromecast does not automatically switch your television to the proper input, this feature may not be available for you and you will need to manually change your television or home theatre system to the proper input.<br /><br />Yup. It's as easy and plug-(and optionally plug)-and-play. Not the end of the world really, but you guys have no idea how ugly this sucker looked hanging off the side of my tv, especially with the USB cord dangling off of it. Once I was booted up I had to download and install a piece of software on my computer, that I'll likely only use this once, to configure the wifi on my device. Google says that iOS support for this part is coming soon. After the program installs I'm prompted to do another install, this time for a Chrome extension. Sigh. Okay. A few dialog boxes later I'm setup. Finally.<br /><br />But I'm a long-time user of Google products. Function first, then the pretty finish. And honestly, once your up and running, the UI of the Chromecast is pretty nice. Quick sidebar: We've got a Roku in our living room and I'd never put much thought behind how much I actually used the remote. I've got the Roku remote app on my iPhone and I use it a fair bit, but honestly, for simple pausing and rewinding, the physical remote is great. Now, back to the Chromecast, there is no remote. You must use a compatible app to start playing and control content. For example, my mother, God love her, doesn't carry her phone on her at all times like I do. On Friday, if I decided I didn't want to watch Arrested Development with her anymore, and I walked out of the room, she would have lost her ability to pause or control the show. This is part of the design of the Chromecast, and I honestly don't fault it for it. Is it frustrating? For Netflix? Yes. For tab streaming from Chrome? Not really. Which foreshadows my purchase of an Apple TV.<br /><br />What really peeved me about the Chromecast is that no matter what happens, if I'm using my iOS device, the content I want to push to the Chromecast MUST be available online. Local photo sharing? Nope. Local screen mirroring? Nope. Music? Well, Pandora support is coming... but local music is a no. And no Google Play Music app for iOS means no way for iOS users to play music at all for now.<br /><br />I'm not mad I bought a Chromecast. With the now defunct Netflix offer it was a steal and I look forward to seeing Google make it into something a little more useful than its current state. But honestly, the ideas and promises of the Chromecast made me lust after something else. Something that does do those things. Something I can buy today. And I did.<br /><br />- Apple TV (3rd Generation, rev A)<br /><br />From setup to boot up I never found myself wondering why I had to do something. The only thing missing from the box is an HDMI cable, which I keep a spare of anyways. The Chromecast does include all potential accessories, which is a nice surprise, but I don't won't give the Apple TV any marks off for not since none of the other set-top-streamers don't. Connecting to the wifi was easier than on the Chromecast since I could do it from my TV using the included remote. Yeah, a physical remote. I entered the password and then I had a working device.<br /><br />I put my iPhone into Airplay mirroring immediately and was having fun. Then I called my mom over and showed her how to share photos onto the screen (Open Photos app, tab Airplay icon). She picked it up effortlessly. This in contrast to me attempting to explain the Chromecast such that she never understood it.<br /><br />The Apple TV still has limitations, yes, but they're far fewer than that of the Chromecast. I'd like to see an App/Channel store and similarly the ability to hide some of the channels I'm never going to use.<br /><br />- Bottom Line<br /><br />The fact is, iOS users and owners who have been lusting after an Apple TV but have never wanted to put down the $100 will be disappointed in a Google Chromecast. It just won't deliver the way an Apple TV could.<br /><br />But honestly, everything the Chromecast does Apple TV does better. Chromecast supports Netflix streaming when started from a mobile app, Apple TV lets you browse and start from your TV. Chromecast lets you mirror a browser tab, but Apple TV lets you mirror and entire display from OS X or iOS. So, if you're in the iOS ecosystem it's Apple TV. Accept no pretenders.<br /><br />For my friends on Android, it's probably just a meh. It doesn't do much right now, and for that reason and the Netflix offer ending you shouldn't get in much of a rush and especially if you already have a way to stream Netflix to your TV.<br /><br />And if you still can't decide, there's always the lovable Roku. It sits right in the middle price-wise and has the most to offer for people who honestly don't want to have to use a phone or a tablet to unlock more ways of accessing content.le TV (3rd Generation, rev A)<br /><br />From setup to boot up I never found myself wondering why I had to do something.

B003QSJDZQ|5.0|The movie is funny and clever. Also very quotable! There are lovable characters and entertaining villains. It also has a great message portrayed through the main character's journey that an unselfish life with friends is far better than a selfish one spent alone.
B007I8S1TY|3.0|What I really want is to have the author sitting next to me. This goes someway to making that happen, but the tone is very dry and the information very dense.<br /><br />I wonder if it would have made more sense in paper, where I could scan it faster. On kindle it wasn't a good read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Learned so much about ourselves from children. Lots of twists and turns at the end. Very well written. Looking to read the next book in the series. The bad end up doing great good. The good end up doing great evil. Sad.....
B00A3AU9KI|5.0|I'm usually skeptical about these car chargers since they always end up messing up. I've had this one for a few months and it works like a champ. It's a great charger for the iPhone 5 and I highly recommend it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed the grafics and story line. I think that the interactive player part was well written and easy to follow.
B005CGI3ZG|4.0|My daughter and I have had a great time watching the Dawson's Creek series this summer...she is finally 16 and old enough:) While I love this series, I am saddened that the opening song has been changed. It doesn't evoke the feelings I had watching it the first time around...I cringe every time the new song plays. Other than that the DVD collection has everything I remember and loved and now my daughter loves.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I thought the book was well written, it certainly showed all the greatness of this man as well as his flaws.  I just wish I did not know so much about the flaws.  It is a shame he did not know the importance of treating people like the Golden Rule.  There is no doubt he was a visionary genius and we owe a lot to him for that.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I love the pinball game on my home pc- now can take it with me!  Great visualization- great grapics also.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|We watched this with our 13-year-old granddaughter and thoroughly enjoyed the humor.  There were a lot of surprises that kept us interested as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The love story continues and very involved.  Answers alot of questions.  It is a page turner.  Sad that I read the book so quick.
1572816295|3.0|If you like the style of the artwork, you might enjoy this deck.  Personally, I chose them thinking the cards would be as colorful as the box but some of the images are dark (in terms of colors, not symbols), which makes them a bit difficult to make out from certain angles.  A beginning reader might have difficulty in that sense.  You really have to know what they are without the benefit of the symbols and images on the cards.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy it, and have spent way too many hours playing it already!  One of my favorites on my home pc.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Great sequel, very suspenseful I really enjoyed it. Can't wait to read the last in the series. These characters really came to life.
B00CISAPJS|4.0|It definitely shine some light on jack and the beanstalk children story. Not very kid ish but a god watch
B0094BB4TW|5.0|You can keep contact with all family and friends with my Kindle.  Now if you can get bejeweled on kindle it would be wonderful.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth & Joe seemingly work very well together and enjoy there craft immensely. They honor their craft's past with choosing these standards to perform. They execute their craft well. This is a very listenable CD and they'[ve done another since called Seesaw, I recommend them both.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really liked this book. I chose five stars because once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. I didn't like how Charlie didn't ask Sam out I thought they would really be a cute couple. I would definitely recommend this book to all my friends.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|expected way more from this artist no issue with downloading the album on my phone from amazon BUT the album itself was just okay
B00CH26TL8|5.0|this game is very entertaining.  Keeps you wanting to play all day long.  I love how you so many levels.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|its so good to have a show that's not about murder or ugly crimes. it also shows a higher moral value.
B008K8U13K|5.0|I'm glad I purchased this for my grandson, he loves it!! I have so much playing it with him as well!
B001DCQI8W|5.0|Great recording of some wonderful symphonies. I love Bruckner, and Karajan really does it justice. Having all 9 symphonies in a boxed set is great.
B00821OX98|4.0|Good script and good actors.  Goes hand in hand with such shows as &#34;Terra Nova&#34; and &#34;Earth 2&#34;.  Suitable for teens and older.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm very happy with it! The graphics are fun. My kids also play it and they love it too. It's a game that you can stop playing for awhile if needed and you can go back to it in a couple days.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I have probably watched this film a dozen times.  Every time I see it I recognize something else from mythology.This is certainly worth watching again and again...
140006922X|5.0|A well written book. Buyers beware of the crazed Fox News reviewers trying to discredit the Author.<br /><br />Read the book for yourself. Enough is enough.
B001KT6JPA|4.0|I liked the movie and it was suspenseful , but it was not as good as Silence of the Lambs.  I also like Jodie Foster better.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|can't figure out how to use it, if I knew and could figures it out I would like it more
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Saw it in the theater,  it was just as good at home on the tv. Awesome, and as a Prime member,  rental is Free!
B003VW8GT6|4.0|This is a great movie.  It is okay for families.  It is action like the good western movies I enjoyed as a child.  John Wayne is the best.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Beautiful visual imagery, engaging storyline, great acting and wonderful musical score. If you have not started watching Downton Abbey, you are missing out.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|I got from Santa it's great nice and nice transformers transformers revenge of the fallen transformers dark of the moon
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|Excellent book - excellent series - to wrap romance, time travel, historical events, humour, early law and medicine into one extraordinary series is a feat which Diana Gabaldon has achieved with superb use of the language and dialogues.  Loved it, loved it, loved it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great way to pass the time! I have really enjoyed flowing through the different levels. It does start off quite easy, but soon enough you are challenged and you just won't give up...lol...you must make it to the next level before you can put it down!  Of course, that may be just me...but, I don't think so : )
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Recently the layout for youtube on the web has changed and im to lazy to download a flash player so I looked for youtube apps and found this great app I just entered my account name and watched all the videos I wanted to. I recommend this app to anyone wanting to watch youtube. :P
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is amazing and awesome you should totally get it its so much fun but watch out for battles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a really  good game! Especially cause it's always upgrading . It's really mind boggling when it becomes faster because your going to start panicking about what to do next. My suggestion is buy lots of hoverboards and use them when about to die
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|I enjoy this game.  It's simple and fun.  It's the perfect sort of game for when you are waiting in a doctors office or for an oil change or whatnot.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|While the case is a little thin, that makes it lightweight and it does feel durable. The front flap stays closed, even without a snap or latch. I like the non-skid material. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a Kindle Fire case at a great price.
B002KKCVVO|5.0|The fit was just great.  He's wearing them and loves the support.  A well made, nice looking item that will last.
B0099G6Q5E|3.0|This is a decent album, but it is not the exact soundtrack from the movie.  The tracks are clearly studio recordings, and sound slightly different to the actual movie.  This is particularly evident in the Bellas final where you can hear where the individual parts are cut together instead of layered as they are in the movie.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Always a great group of familiar characters, plus some new ones.  All the action and adventure with mystery that you could want, on a world stage.  A very good series!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game to play love it. My nephews love it too. Would recommend it to anybody who wants to keep their kids entertained
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Ordered it the moment it went live on amazon and had it in my hand two days after it. Setup was simple, just plug in to the tv, and then login to the setup page on your laptop using chrome. then install the chromecast plugin on chrome browser so you can 'cast' the content.<br /><br />pros:<br />*simple setup<br />*you can switch between devices to control the video playback<br />*inexpensive<br /><br />cons:<br />*very limited apps that support casting as of now (this may be a non-issue in future as more apps come in)<br />*external power supply requirement makes this not truly a dongle<br /><br />Overall a great toy for 35 bucks!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Amazon is still working on a patch, Won't start up, will lock your kindle fire in a state that requires a complete shutdown and restart. Not worth the headache.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Jordan's books drug some.  When Sanderson took over, the action picked up.  I was very happy with the final book in this series and thought it had a great ending.  You will be somewhat surprised though.  I highly recomment this book and advise you to wade through the whole series.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Very fun game. IF you like horses and games your gonna like this game. When i have nothing to do I like to play this game. This is a very interesting game with horses.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I 'm one of those people that finds it very hard to unwind and call it a day. Being able to make my own melody combinations with this app is awesome. I can finally go to sleep! This app is the best relaxing app you will ever get!
B0090SI582|3.0|The action was okay but I hate deviations from continuity and this movie was nothing but.  I don't recall Viper (Madame Hydra) ever having mutant powers as well as Yukio having any sort of precognition capability.  And the story with the Silver Samaria was way off as well.  Overall the action and special effects were great but it could have been better if it kept with the original story.<br /><br />P.S.  Where was Kitty Pryde?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|amazing game so much fun taking care of horses is a lot of fun kids will love it buy it you'll love it buy I bbbbbbbbbbbbbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyit
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Probably wouldn't watch it again. But then Tom Cruise usually has the ability to entertain in an action flick like this.<br />.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Character development. Dialogue. Monologue. Story-line. Action. Adventure. Drama. Love. Hate. Ice. Fire. Stop reading reviews and start reading this book. You are wasting time.
B006GLT8FK|3.0|The Whole Nine Yards brought some fresh twists to the genre of romantic comedy. Its sequel does not. The characters are entertaining, but in predictable ways. The Whole Ten Yards does not have the re-watch value that The Whole Nine Yards does.
B005544TRQ|4.0|The program is fast moving and with really great actors. I don't care for the left wing zingers that some snotty smelly little writer adds.
B0009VSB06|4.0|An OK metal detector. Annoyed by the coppers i dig up when it says gold, but that's not the issue, the whole trick is to know the sounds of the metals. The handbook provides with great techniques
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book.  The way that all the characters intertwined made it much less about Afghanistan and much more about humanity. Like The Kite Runner, it was beautifully written and very fast-paced.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great characters, engaging story and an incredible history lesson about how drastically the world was changing at the turn of the century.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|Fun and Adorable. You direct Bunnies using Command Icons on bottom of screen.  You can Change Direction, Stop and Reverse Bunnies, Build Bridges and Steps, Dig Tunnels, etc to help Bunnies to travel to Bunny House.  HINTS available and more are earned.  Good Instructions from Options screen and Visual Instructions at start of levels.  Items like Lightning , Bombs, etc are also provided later and Explained well.  Good Scoring and Star achievements.<br /><br />HD Graphics are Cute and great.  Music is Pleasant and Sound Effects are Funny.  The Controls work well and Screen can be scrolled with your finger for better views.  There is also a FAST FORWARD button so you can speed up the slow Bunnies any time.<br /><br />Overall, an ENJOYABLE, ENTERTAINING and ADORABLE game that is awesome for children and the young at heart.  Flopp-Eared Bunnies are very Cute and make Funny sounds that add to the Fun.  Thankfully, NO PERMISSIONS, Ads, IAPs or ADDONS in this app.  SAFE AND SECURE!<br />It also worked with WiFi OFF.  It's a Real KEEPER and I recommend it.
B0018Q4DTY|5.0|This album came out in 1996 when I was in high school. 2013 and this album is still better than 99% of the music content on the radio right now.  CLASSIC nuff said!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It's simple to use and very effective. I always use the cellular as an alarm clock but since mine had broken down, I got this as an emergency and it worked beautifully! Very user friendly.
B00BQHA0UQ|4.0|I wanted to write this review long time ago, actually after listening to \\"Corazon Profundo\\" the same day it was released. Why now? Well, I went yesterday to see Carlos @ Toyota Center in Houston and it was an amazing show because of the well-thought set list, the quality of the music and the opportunity to dance for 2.5 hours. A nice party overall! \\"Clasicos De La Provincia\\" was my first \\"encounter\\" with Vives' music 20 years ago and since then it has grown in intensity (especially after marrying my Colombian wife). I enjoy Carlos' musical creativity, imagination to merge ethnic and modern rhythms and his artistic intelligence to bring together different generations with Vallenato (although his originality scandalized Vallenato purists at that time).<br /><br />When I heard about this album with new original material I did not believe I would like it since I could not connect with \\"El Rock De Mi Pueblo\\" 10 years ago; I don't think ERDMP was a poor record but it was too \\"experimental\\" for my taste and too commercial for those songs that were released as singles such as \\"Como Tu\\". Probably is similar to my lack of connection with P.A.R.C.E. from Juanes which showed a tired artist that needs to reconnect with his roots (although the concert last June was fantastic). From beginning to end, I like every song from \\"Corazon Profundo\\", the simple as well as the complex ones, and yesterday it was clear how well received this record has been by the public - so well received that Carlos played more than half of it with everybody singing each song, closing the core with \\"Volvi A Nacer\\" and the encore with \\"La Fantastica\\" - a terrific theme to finish the concert. I still position \\"El Amor De Mi Tierra\\" as top in my list (together with \\"Clasicos De La Provincia I\\" as his breakthrough album) but \\"Corazon Profundo\\" is with no doubt a clear #2 (followed by \\"Dejame Entrar\\"). A very nice comeback indeed!
0393327655|5.0|I have only made it one chapter in, have already found it packed with profound thoughts and very quote-worthy excerpts. Having read Harris' Letter to a Christian Nation and made it a chapter into this book, I have no reservation in recommending End of Faith.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game--lots of variations so it never is boring. It's also fun to play the same game over and over to beat my own score and the scores of other players.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|it got to 15 lv and I love that game it so cool games.<br />I all way play play to get 40lv and I am 17 lv<br />azbdhxhxhcbcbxvx vdgdvxxbxjxmxnz xbxbxbzvdhsjhdaahgzs zcz s abs bs dbdb
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show gets you from the first episode and takes you on an emotional rollercoaster for 3 seasons.<br />The characters are so intriguing and the setting is amazing!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Superior acting, characters to hate and love.  Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) is by far my favorite character in the show right now.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I highly recommend this to anyone who liked season one! This season has everything that made the first season excellent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a very cool and awesome game. gameloft has done a fantastic and outstanding job. thank you gameloft. brandon
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once again, this show doesn't fail to impress me with witty dialogue, amazing storylines, and breathtaking costumes/scenery. I couldn't stop watching them- one after another. Now can't wait for the next season. SO happy this was on Amazon!!!!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Good scrip. Very enjoyable. Would recommend. Only thing is more twists and less sex. Watch it with someone you want to sue.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Not your usual courtroom novel.  The end was grim.  There was a great character examination going on with Jacob and his Dad.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Perhaps all the impossible to pronounce Arabic names influenced my overall opinion.  The story line just didn't flow for me.  The intrigue is there but the suspense didn't particularly build for me...I didn't have any trouble putting it down to do something else for a while.  I loved Gold Coast and the Gatehouse and this isn't in that league.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I've purchased 4 seasons now, and it just gets better with each episode. Great cast, great premise, great show! Though Simon Baker is no doubt the lead, this is a terrific ensemble cast, one you enjoy getting to know better with each season.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|It is great to hear they are still awesome even after 30 years.  can't wait to see them live again
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was okay to read but don't know what all the press was about. Just a over rated sex, love story.
0763621803|5.0|My daughter loves Charlie and Lola and they are our current go-to books for birthday presents for her friends. Love it!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|As always,  James Rollins does it again.  He shows a more intimate look at his main characters.  Would like to see the tracker and his dog incorporated in the story line of his next Sigma installment.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Black Sabbath plus Ozzy Osbourne plus Rick Rubin equals perfection.  This is the best heavy metal album of all time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much, better than the movie. The movie was good, but I love the way the author took you inside each  character and held you there.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|exciting, but not scary. my 20 month old actually sat for it and my 4 year told love love loved it.
B000HL2J0G|3.0|Great show for the whole family to watch. Clean and entertaining.  It teaches good moral lessons along the way for the kids.
B001O03NCW|5.0|This is a great soundtrack and has a little something for everyone.  I'm not  a huge country-western fan but this has many elements that make it fun to listen to and to sing along with while driving, doing housework, walking,..... so on and so on.<br /><br />I recommend it to those with an eclectic taste in music and an appreciation for a good beat and great  harmonies.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|Can't use it on my Kindle Kindle Fire. Can't figure out how to operate it. Very confusing on a small screen.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|The boys do a great job of re-establishing themselves. This album brings back the classic sound for a new age. Stuart Price can do no wrong with his production skills. Strongly recommend it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan is a scholar and a fine one at that!  This book gives excellent insight into what the world of Jesus of Nazareth was like during the time he walked upon it.  It does NOT claim to be theology.  Do with your faith what you will but give this good man credit for fine scholarship.
0812982622|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book especially considering the press it has received and the awards it won.  I did not care for the very political climax - ending.
140006922X|5.0|Aslan is a true academic and scholar whose work brings a new historical perspective to the story of Jesus of Nazareth.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Very poorly written and unimaginative. I purchased it knowing it was fluff, but was still disappointed. Even as an easy read, it was disappointing and I wish I hadn't spent money on it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app so much I play it about every day I love the multiplayer part of it because me and my cousins play it sometimes
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this. I downloaded it because it was free, and I continue to play it. The only thing that bothers me is how many pearls you need, and the fact that almost all of the chests require them. They do give an opportunity to get free ones for logging on each day, at least.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|There's no high quality!!! There use to be but now there isn't and without it you cant see like anything in the game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful series. I am loving season 3 and the price was quite reasonable. I would recommend to all.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|The arc that Kvothe set out in The Name of the Wind hits book 2 and Rothfuss is proving that he is no fluke.  The one is a little longer than book 1, but it's still excellent.  The most exciting part of this novel is that you truly start to see the further development that will lay the groundwork for the rest of the series.<br /><br />My only complaint is a selfish one.  I wish I would have discovered this series at a much later date so that I could be into the second trilogy already, instead of having to wait for book 3 to come out.  Rothfuss takes some time to put his novels out, but it is well worth it so far.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I never did play it because it never connected to my app, I would love to play it because I am sure it is a good game but I have had a little trouble could you help me.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|There seem to be a lot of questions about the setup, so I'll go through what I did.<br /><br />1. Plug the Chromecast into an HDMI input on your TV/Monitor/whatever.<br />2. Depending on the HDMI port used, you may or may not need to also plug in the USB cable (provided with the Chromecast) to the Chromecast to provide power.  In my case, I connected it to a USB port on the TV.  There is also a power supply included in case you don't happen to have a USB port nearby.<br />3. Turn on the TV, if it isn't already on, and select the HDMI port with the Chromecast as the input.<br />4. Chromecast logo should appear for a few seconds as it boots up, then it should be ready to connect to your network.<br />5. Follow the onscreen instructions which are very simple, you can use any computer, tablet, phone, as long as it connects to the same wifi network you plan to use your Chromecast on.  In case it isn't already obvious, you need a wifi network for the Chromecast to work.  That said, your TV DOES NOT need to be \\"smart\\" in any way, all your TV needs is an HDMI input.<br />6. While setting up your Chromecast to connect to your network, there will be options for security (WPA, WPA2, etc etc), it will also display the MAC address of the Chromecast if you happen to have your wifi set to filter connections by MAC address.<br />7. Once the Chromecast is connected to your network, it is ready to receive commands from any device connected to the network it is on.<br />8. From a mobile device (tablet/phone), load up netflix or youtube.  There should be a button on the top of the screen that looks like a TV (a rectangle) with a few waves coming out of the corner.  Press on this button, and choose your Chromecast as the display.<br />9. Pick something to watch, hit play, and watch on your TV.<br />10. Remember the video stream isn't coming from your control device, it is going directly to the Chromecast from the internet.  Your device is simply the remote control.<br />11. On computer,you can show the contents of tabs in a Chrome web browser, but this is performed by actually encoding a video stream on the fly and streaming it to the Chromecast.  The quality what you see on your TV will depend heavily on the specs of the computer you are streaming from.  Don't expect this to be pretty unless you have a great computer.<br />12. Enjoy<br /><br />So far, I've been incredibly satisfied with the Youtube and Netflix performance of the Chromecast.  As this device is still brand new, there aren't many services that fully support it yet, but seeing how popular it is (sold out on Google Play, Amazon, and Bestbuy) I have very little doubt that in the coming days and weeks that most services will add Chromecast support.  For me, it works perfectly, streaming 1080p video with no hiccups, audio problems, or anything... then again, why would there be, all it does is stream video from the web, which is mostly dependent on your internet connection.  It takes a couple seconds to load up the apps to play videos, but once the app is loaded, switching between videos happens as fast as your internet connection allows the stream to buffer.<br /><br />I love it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There's not much to say here, the previous reviews speak for the masterpiece that Howley has put out.  Wool is an engrossing read, full of rich characters and a world that is, sadly, easy to believe in.  As a reader of mostly fantasy series, Wool was the first Sci-Fi series that I have tried in a long, long time and it may have me reaching for a few more.<br /><br />I have no doubt that we will be seeing these on the big screen one day and will be talking about them in the same breadth as Alien, just for sheer atmosphere and awesomeness.  Good job Mr. Howey!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always loved solitaire...and this game can keep you busy for hours. It is a five star game for me...it is simple and easy to read ...no fancy footwork, just good clean fun.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|My daughter and I loved this movie and I think she has watched it now at least 15 times in about 2 months
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The entire collection of movies were excellant.  My children enjoyed watching them and will most likely start the series over and watch them again.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Not since Mistborn, have I been so pleasantly surprised with a series.  Rothfuss has created a rich world that actually does stay away from the fantasy cliches.  Kvothe is a wonderful character and the world that surrounds him is just as engaging.  While the book is long, I never found myself growing bored and I attribute that completely to the author's prose.<br /><br />This is not a man with just a clever idea or two, Mr. Rothfuss can actually write!  I cannot stress this enough.  So many fantasy authors have intriguing characters and good ideas, but their ability to write... ugh.  The Name of the Wind doesn't read like a middle school creative writing class, it actually takes the reader away and brings vivid memories that authors like Tolkien, Cormac, Martin and others envoke.<br /><br />The one complaint I have seen a few times is about the main characters.  If you enjoyed the characterizaion of Tony Stark in the Iron Man movies, how an egotistical jerk could be so likeable, you will love Kvothe.<br /><br />Grab this today if you're looking for something well written and totally new.

B005F96URI|5.0|This film starring Josh Hartnett as the Drifter, Woody Harrelson as the Bartender,J-Pop superstar /actor Gackt as,the Samurai,Ron Perlman as Nicola the Woodcutter,and Demi Moore as his lady Alexandra. Takes place in an alternate world, where because of the mindless bloodshed . Of a devastating world war all firearms, have been banned worldwide.

To take down the city's most powerful crime lord Nicola the Woodcutter, But first they'll have to get help from the Bartender at the Horseless Horseman Saloon, and then fight their way through Nicola's henchman.  Anyway liked this movie a lot ,I'm surprised why didn't this come out in theaters. But even if it did it was limited release , in select theaters.
B0029QRA1U|1.0|The description of the Vinyl-to-Mp3 Turntable was inaccurate. The day I received the turntable I went to try the product and the only the I heard was loud annoying distortion. I kept changing Vinyls thinking that it was the disk and not the turntable, but I was finally convinced that the turntable does not work properly. I didn't give up just yet.I called the company that created this turntable and we tried fixing the problems and after a long hour, the distortion still existed in my recordings. I finally came to the conclusion that this turntable does not work which is why I gave it such a low rating. Next time please indicate the problems it would have or any defect that may occur when using this product.
B003P2WO5E|3.0|Sanderson looks to be getting a little too engrossed in his cleverness and desire to write a truly epic series instead of just finishing one up (poorly).  This 1000 page book feels a little like Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth) from Goodkind in that it was just throw away material to introduce the main character(s) and dabble in the true story.  There's no doubt that Sanderson will not go the way of Goodkind and just churn out pointless novel after pointless novel for a check, but The Way of Kings could have easily been cut down to 250 pages, which would have been much more engrossing.<br /><br />Hopefully Sanderson will get on track and realize that a good, focused story is much more entertaining than wanting to have a 12 book series.
B00127RAJY|5.0|today was my first day doing this workout and i loved every minute of it. but honestly its not as challenging as everyone says it is. probably because i exercise alot already but even so i felt really really good afterwards. not like i was totally tired out but like i got a thorough workout and it was better than all the other workouts that ive done. i love jillian she is amazing and i feel like she really knows what shes doing. but what i did wonder was why the core work part was so shor. at first it felt like i wasnt doing anything for them but when the whole workout was over my core was tight, i was holding it in without having to try that hard. it just happened naturally. but yeah all in all its a great workout especially if you are just now getting in exercising or if your coming back fom your resting period.
0767853636|5.0|I really love this Movie of Annie (The Classic Edition DVD)<br />is playable in the Widescreen & Full Screen Format on 1 disc<br />The disc is single sided. I think the TV version of Annie<br />starring Kathy Bates as Miss Hannigan was poor.<br /><br />The Full Screen and Widescreen are<br />listed in the \\"product Details\\"<br /><br />Not by this \\"Annie (Widescreen Edition)\\"<br />When you go to the classic edition DVD.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This game was so fun had so much color and very good graphics hint fills up fast story was great and the price was good everyone needs to try it I love it I hope it never ends
B00A81MV3U|5.0|constantly on the move, never a dull moment.  The characters are point on and kept my attention throughout the movie.
B002CNK1MK|3.0|This was a huge hit in the day, and some of the scenes are still great.  Well-written and picturesque.  Tom Cruise chews the scenery by today's standards.  It's a &#34;road movie&#34; with a hard-to-swallow premise.  I guess that shows how stupid we all were back there in the 80s.  I was able to watch the whole thing.
B001ECQ6PG|5.0|It's a delight to hear vintage Lp recordings. The only issue is<br />the speaker volume, it's not powerful enough. But it works perfect<br />with external loudspeakers.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|It was like a musical and dance film put together, which it is but great fun to watch any time.
B005D63ICI|5.0|What's bad about Dexter? Just him, it seems. But in such a way that he is just so good. Who doesn't want to bypass the law and off bad guys? Exactly.
B002WCLG48|3.0|I'am a huge fan of the Halo games and lore, so I was expecting some really awsome stories form this dvd. Unfortunately, I only got a few good/entertaining stories. There was about three out of the seven stories that I really enjoyed. The rest where decent, nothing amazing. Its worth renting, but not buying even if your a Halo fanboy.
B002PD9JNE|5.0|I really like the flow of this music.  I think this is the best work the group has done.  Have in on my iPod for workouts.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|I stumbled about this movie by mistake. I was looking for another film when I came across this one, I said to myself \\"let me watch it, but I'm probably going to regret it\\". And to my pleasant surprise, I liked it alot. Would recommend if you like movies geared towards kids.
B00000I0XW|5.0|enjoyed to the max,voice of singers fabulous,selected songs very good selections.<br />lost count of how many times I have listened.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It is unfathomable that Shin survived such horror. I am stunned that a young man who was born to suffer, and \\"repent\\" found the will to push on in the most extreme circumstances. This is a must read for everyone. It will bring a new perspective to the world you thought you knew.
B001EGFQNU|5.0|The music was as good as any music of that era, probably better than the music of our era, the sound is unique.  The DVD is most excellent.  This is an excellent addition to anyone's collection.

B00CDY6HW6|1.0|It lets me get into level select screen and after most of the load completes it crashes without error report.
0451228731|5.0|I work at a game company that creates large-scale online games, so a lot of the themes in Daemon were very familiar to me. This book was just amazing in its breadth and scope. It was very well researched.<br /><br />Daemon was so intense -- I couldn't put it down, and I feel lucky that the sequel was available when I finished. I highly recommend both!<br /><br />The audiobook rendition is also very well produced.<br /><br />I can't wait to see more from this author!
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|This album is a good debut and very well produced.  I like the general feel of the music, but the hit Somebody I Used to Know really stand out above them all.  Good for someone who enjoys electronic music
B009KS4XRO|3.0|You would think that you would build up time, games whatever it is when you run out but not here. I refuse to buy a game so, when I would keep playing if it was free not here.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Once again, the British troubador has produced a set of numbers that evoke passion and beauty.  Richard Thompson has always delighted me with his songs and Electric continues the tradition.  Highly recommended for the Folk Music fan
1590171993|3.0|There is not much left to add to all the praising reviews I've read. A \\"perfect\\" story about a seemingly failed life, beautifully written and inspired by a compassion and detachment that is almost superhuman. However, after putting the book down, I had some afterthoughts: Stoner's life wasn't wasted, for sure, but I rather hesitate to call him a model to follow; he is a perfect exemple of how too much wisdom leads to not taking your life in your hands and that's always a pity.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This was for my daughter and she loves it.  As far as I know, it arrived early and was in great condition.  Thanks!
0061673730|2.0|I'm angry, I feel deceived. I had expected a lot, but it was just a waste of time.<br />The writing is very rudimentary and dry, the final chapter is the kind of writing you can expect from a college boy or girl. The technique of using a motorcyling journey only serves to ease the heaviness of the philosophical parts.<br />Now, the philosophy behind the book: Pirsig thinks he's original in his critical view on the western way of coping with reality (the divide between object and subject, the rational method to dissect reality, etc); Plato and Aristotle are his culprits and the Greek sofists (of whom we know practically nothing) are his heroes. Pirsig (or better, the mysterious Phaedrus) introduces a third way (next to the classical and romantic way of coping with reality), with the notion of \\"Quality\\", but he does not succeed in making clear what he means by this, he refers to \\"excellence\\", \\"thoughtfulness\\", and \\"accuracy\\", all very ambiguous. In some reviews I read that he opens up to the eastern way of coping with reality, the word \\"Zen\\" in the title of the book seems to confirm that, but in reality, there's is only one short piece in the book, with a citation of Lao Tse.<br />In short, we get a 500-page long quest of the presumed unique thinking of Phaedrus (his former, genial self, before his insanity and a electroshock-therapy), without suspense.<br />I'm disappointed, and the best proof for my critical remarks, is in  the way Pirsig treats his own son. All the way through the journey the 11 year old Chris is sitting behind him on the motorcycle. Pirsig treats him in a demeaning and disdaining way, really horrible, and not quite in the way Quality would require.
B003ASLJRW|4.0|What's else is there to say. Clint make great westerns and to have this western on blu-ray, the scenery and sounds are impressive.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game . my kids play with it all the time.. it helps me pass time while I'm on my lunch break
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|the grandkids cannot put it down,  they are huge Minion fans<br /><br />be careful with parental controls there are lots of opportunities for purchases and communications with social media
B008Y768XO|5.0|A great dog movie, based on a true story.  Be warned - it's a tear jerker. (Aren't all dog movies?)
B003XE1CU2|4.0|This is the second pair I bought, and this pair is much tighter than the first pair.  I am hoping they will stretch out.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|What a wealth for knowledge.  How can we stumble thru life expecting to make things work out, but not knowing the rules of the game.  It is like bowling with a sheet hung in front of the pins.  thank you Rick
0425252868|5.0|I would recommend this book without a doubt. It gives an amazingly clear perspective of the terror, soul searching, and emotions of war. It takes you to the men, not just the viewing of them as \\"the enemy.\\" I could not put this down and did not want it to end. In fact, I kept stalling to prevent myself from finishing it because I knew it would be difficult to find another book to top, or rival this. I only wish my dad was still here so I could discuss it with him, as he was on the front lines in WWII. Thank you to Makos and Alexander for such a masterpiece and tribute to these fine men!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have had this for.. two days?  And it's already fundamentally changed the way I watch my TV.  And with a little tinkering, using info I found online, I am able to stream media from a local server, and remotely access my computers desktop.  Unbelievable the capabilities packed into this tiny little $35 package.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|Really well paced and the desire to know the truth makes it a real page turner, however for me it almost goes too far in dragging out the &#34;reveal&#34; which has the unfortunate effect of building it up so much that even a decent reveal leaves you wanting more.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of the best movie adaptations of a book ever, and I would highly recommend it to any Jane Austen fans.
B001EYK52O|4.0|I enjoyed watching it. It was a similar plot line to the 1999 version but not close enough that it kept my attention.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|It was as good as advertised.  Since I had never seen the original...I was really going into this one with an open opinion.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fun little time killer. Easy to get the hang of and very addictive! I really like the fact that I am competing against my friends. The only draw back is that I run out of lives too quickly.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I can't seem to put these books down! I can't wait to read the next one. I'm causing some jealousy over this book from my husband. Lol amazing story and again... I love the characters of Jace and Clary.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I would highly recommend this, but if you read Harry Bosch, you know there aren't any bad ones!!!  Great read, and actually one of the best.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has latched onto a great storyline and she doles it out to you in great bites that leave you wanting more.  This is a book you won't want to put down and when you finish, you'll be reaching for the next in the series.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Joss Whedon's unmistakeable flair comes clearly across in this popcorn movie.  The dialogue is crisp and witty, and it genuinely looks as though the cast is having fun making it.  I loved the gag reel, too.  I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Fun, quick read about an extraordinary man.  Interesting little tidbits of the author's beliefs about self-improvement and mind-over-matter intrude in odd spots at times and it's written from an interesting perspective (deity-worship of Tesla?), but overall well done.
B0090SI4OC|1.0|How did this movie get such a high rating?  It was almost as painful to watch as breaking dawn part 1, very rarely do I feel robbed of my 1.50 at redbox but this movie wasn't even worth 50 cents.  The acting is absolutely horrible and the script was just as bad!  This lady needs to stop writing because she sucks and the movie's that come from them are even worse!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Although he writes about countries, customs  and people so different than mine, the choices we make and consequences of them are universal as well as our pain, hopes and dreams.  He offers no quick and easy solutions yet satisfying.  He must have tremendous insight to human behavior, as well as ability to express it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think wait no I know this is awe some every single thing about it if you have a touch tablet or phone in your hand download this game !!!&iexcl;!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!! xxxxxxxx!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!xxxxxxxxxx!!!!!!!!boooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!xxxxxxxxxxxxx!!!!!!!!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Like being able to explore and fight bad guys.  Graphics are good.  You can also scroll to another location in your map!!
140006922X|3.0|I looked up this book after seeing Aslan on the Bill Maher show. (Does that make me a liberal?)  It's just amazing to see the polarity of the reviews.  On the whole, it's either all for, or all against.  Looks just like modern America and many other parts of the world.  Sure would like to see a way to the middle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved the challenge of the game. I love solving puzzles and I would pay to play more levels and puzzles
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Like his other novels, James Rollins' mix of science and thriller is incredibly exciting. I can't believe that I must wait another year for the next!
B00C3MKCIS|4.0|We always expect a lot from a all star line up. A<br />very good record but I think they should be better<br />at a live performance.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is a very entertaining show. It has a combination of humor and mystery that keeps you engaged until the end.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|This is a superb tower defense game. It has been fun and challenging for me. Many levels to play through. Each map requires new and varied strategies which keeps the play experience fresh.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|There are few concerts that have moved me like the one performed in 2002 as a tribute to the life and work of George Harrison. The concert proceedings were spot on and the musicians, one and all, a tour de force in anyone's book. While the rendition of Sarve Shaam was sublime, as it represented the lesser known spiritual side of George Harrison, the solo from Eric Clapton in While My Guitar Softly Weeps was for me the closest expression you could get to the depth of grieving and mourning for a man who gave so much to music - we will miss you George.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|Just terrible. Not good at all. I wish I could take a pill that would wipe this sad excuse for a movie from my mind.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because it's like taking care of a real horse. This game isn't inappropriate and doesn't involve spending any money. So if you want to fees ride and play with the horse this is the game for you.
B000SEI230|5.0|This is, without question, my favorite Nicholas Sparks book ever written. However anyone expecting a play by play of the movie will be  surprised. It's a wonderful book, I suggest everyone read  it! Be ready for some emotions though!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|No words or emotions can explain how much I enjoy the Game of Thrones series.  I m setting on pins and needles waiting on the next series.  I can not wait people.  Trust me just try it out via HBO and you will fall for it.  Thank you.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This movie looked like it had potential, but it was terrible.  I wasted my money by even renting this.  Stopped watching 20 minutes in.  Kept trying to give it a chance, but ultimately cut my losses.  Hollywood's continued focus on quantity and not quality clearly show through.  If they announce This Is 42 - The Sequel, just move along and read a good book.
B006RXSM9A|4.0|I enjoyed it. SEventeen more words required? I enjoyed it I enjoyed... Sorry, I couldn't resist. The film is as bright and comedic and enjoyable as I remembered in the theatres.  I'm nrmally not a musical fan, but I'd walk a mile on my knees through broken glass for Queen Latifah! :D Great film!
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|His books are readable so no surprise that this movie holds you attention from the very start.  Tom C. is delightful, as usual and seems to be well cast for the part.
B00486UF52|5.0|This is a very entertaining, through unflattering, portrait of the English. The author says that she set out to merely analyze her people but the book is equally good as a guide for foreigners planning to settle in the land of the class-and-privacy-obsessed, passive-aggressive Brits.
B009ZQHQ84|3.0|I am a career educator, and while I appreciate films that discuss the current state of American education, this film needed a technical advisor.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Usually do not like Woody Allen films, but this is for all of us who feel a better age is in the past, but maybe not!!
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Enjoyable to say the least. While I enjoyed the original one, this one is distinctly more grown up that the older Judge Dredd with Stalone. A true dystopian future to say the least, a true contrast from the first movie.
B003TTCURU|3.0|I lost intrest after the 3rd season. So much personal crap of who is doing who!  Was good the first couple seasons tho.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Son wanted this so bad, you had a good price and now he  loves his mom for getting it. Thanks
B004T0XYKK|5.0|Interesting albeit predictable story about former Yankee and Confederate foes who band together to save local landowners from an unscrupulous and vicious group of land thieves.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is just pure amazement, and I'm saying it with assertiveness. This book is somewhat fictional yet, you can feel the tension and power the word(s) have.
B003NS2T9G|4.0|It's definitely a good show to watch. Too bad BBC decided to discontinue the series. At least I have he old shows to watch.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really fun I got this game from the app store and it is a good game to kill 45minutes good for kids super fun
0345529057|4.0|Looking forward to reading all books in the series.  The only complaint is the small print. When are the rest of the books coming?
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like it b/c it's providing meanings with detail.Its name dictionary itself  a reason to like it. Gift for knowledge seeker.
1616550414|5.0|Hyrule Historia is compilation of artworks, sketches, story boards and more works from the Zelda games.The book content begins with some words from Shigeru Miyamoto, followed by a collection of art works and sketches from the Skyward Sword, the most recent installment of the series.The next section is a chronology of the series story, starting with a view of the series timeline, followed by a game by game story overview.Afterwards the book continues with more artworks from all the games, including main characters, monsters and scenarios.Next is technical run of all the games, console, releases date and so on.Finally it contains a message from Eiji Aonuma, who has been working in the series since Ocarina of Time, and as a bonus the last pages contain part of the Skyward sword manga, fully translated of course.The book is printed in the highest quality there is, the cover is awesome and it is a really collection item.It's really hard to describe the book in all it's glory but i can assure you, it's really a must have for any fan of the series, and even if you are some what new to the series, this is the perfect way to start.<br />If you are considering to get, just go for it and i guaranty that you won't regret it!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game is quite good it shows you a warrior's way although it was tough through certain levels this game opened my appetite for it
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|I get free daily' s on my phone, but not on my Kindle, I run out of coins to get new courses way to fast, other than that, very good time killer!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I absolutely loved watching Cats on DVD! Their choice of actors, costume, make up and how they staged the show was purrfect for this classic Broadway musical. If your a fan of Cats I definitely suggest this. It's breathe taking and stunning, all in one!
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Get the music, mixes, artists, mixologists, recommendations you like and stream it whenever you want... then add/repost them to your own list that might be followed by others.  It's a sonic community experience.
B0058W74UY|3.0|Doesn't let me use the programs that require flash player. It should let you know that nothing offered is compatible with games that require flash player.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I use it on my kindle, on my ouya, on my galaxy s4, and my nexus one before that.  Astro works okay too, but I like the cleaner interface of ES.  Cheers.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|why must the have sooooo much drama<br /><br />I of course will watch the next season, but seriously too much .
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was hesitant to read this series but I am glad I have. Very good sci-fi. Characters are believable! If you are making the decision....read them!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Hadn't heard too much about this movie before I saw it. It had been mentioned briefly at the Academy Awards. Loved it. Denzel Washington was amazing. Also loved John Goodman's part as the drug dealer. Conscious takes over a twisted past.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Tons of fun for the kids. I have even found myself playing it when they &quot;need help&quot;. Now if I could get my wife to put it down........
B009AMANBA|5.0|Astounding acting by so many. Daniel Day-Lewis was outstanding in this movie. He was Lincoln! I can see why he won the &#34;Best Actor&#34; category at the Oscars. A good look back into the North against the South period in time. The horrors of war. Family against family. A historic look into the hard decisions Lincoln made to stop slavery in this country.
B0054TKB8I|5.0|I did not know what to expect.  But, wow, I am blown away.  I cannot wait to watch the rest of the series!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I had seen this at the movie and wanted to share it with my husband. I thought the acting was wonderful with a wide range of talent. As true to Quentin Tarantino, it had the typical mayhem at the end. A story of revenge to the max.
0307352153|5.0|I found this book wonderful. As an introvert who felt uncomfortable being me in certain situations,I found solace & understanding! Everyone should read this book!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|We loved this set.  The interviews were interesting and the music exceptional.  If you are a fan, I don't think you would be disappointed.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Ok, I've had this game for 2 days and i'm amazed.<br />This is everything that the other crappy kindle gta games aren't.<br />I'm just gonna say if you want a replacement for gta for your kindle get this game of another game in the gangster series.
0985557834|5.0|I really like the way these books are organized into projects you can make.  The pictures and instructions make it easy to follow.  I have an interest in survival preparedness so those projects were neat to see.  I enjoyed making each project in volume 1 and hope to do the same in volume 2.  The suggested initial cord length helps me tremendously as a guideline.  I know the writer does a lot of video tutorials, but for me, I can't seem to seek out the videos to do a project, as I think I would have to keep starting, rewinding, etc..  I do the knot tying just to learn something new and to relax.  Thanks for this book.  I hope there are more to come.  :)
B001HADE00|5.0|I had this record vinyl when it was first released loved it then. I was unable to play it in any of my vehicles so I purchased it here. It hasn't lost a bit of it's charm. Great Album.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an amazing book that everyone should read if they are human! I loved this book and it has an awesome ending, start and middle!!!  ( written by a ten year old )
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Awesome idea, but it doesn't hold a candle to my apple tv or my roku xs.  Easy to setup, but the streaming quality was definitely NOT HD quality.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|this app is friggen awesome love it u should get it I was unsure of it at first but then I started using it and it was awesome I hope u found this review helpfull
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Doesn't make se 've buying it,or even downloading it free,doesn't work on Kindle fire Hd,so I am really upset truly.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I gave this to my nephew for his birthday.  He is a diehard &#34;Whovian.&#34;  He LOVED it!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes Doctor Who!  (Small parts, so definitely not for kids.)
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It does exactly what I need.  I centralize notes, uploaded small android apps and share between PC, phone and tablet.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Heard the song Royals on radio alarm when waking, laid there and listened. Then got coffee and straight to computer to find the song to download.  Saw this EP and downloaded the whole thing.  I have been listening and loving it since!  Can't wait for more!
B006ID01OS|5.0|A fairly short read on &#34;how to think&#34; about strategy.  Stimulating ideas taken from her 30 years as a trainer. And key is to not just keep on keeping on... but think. And then do the work (and enjoy the work) to change your activity into what she calls a clear and meangful (to you AND to the world), &#34;purpose&#34;.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Excellent starter application for fun. Very addictive and will fill your time while helping build spatial awareness. Highly recommended for anyone.
B000G26FLK|5.0|In the last seven years i have used two pair of these every working day. I work in Bahamas so they get wet, the heat is very high but they have lasted 3 years and a half each pair. Normally what happens is that the sole comes unstuck. I recomend them highly.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have followed this series from the very beginning, and this was the finale to end it. All the story lines came together in the epic battle at the end of time, and the twists at the end were (and are) fascinating. I am usually a fast reader, but I spent more than 8 hours just reading Chapter 37. I am still as fascinated by the series as I was in the first book, and I think my next big project will be to go back and read the whole thing again, all 14 books. I highly recommend anyone looking for an engrossing read to start at the beginning and read all the way through this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am not a gamer but got this for my grandchildren.  They love the minions so I am sure they will love it.  I just think it's really cute.
1451695195|5.0|This is a great book bringing science and spirituality together. A must read for anyone seeking to know more of life.
031604461X|5.0|Bought this for my wife for Xmas and she liked the books much better than the movies, but I still think both are great.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|I always loved the superman movies. I watched this with my 12 year old daughter because she never saw it. She kept talking about the &#34;Man of Steel&#34; movie coming out and I told her about the original  movie. It's a classic. Love the plot and entire movie. Must see. And I love being able to watch it instantly through Amazon. Very convenient. Great picture.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|As a sibling of a mentally ill sister, I fear reading it but was drawn to it. I could definitely identify with scenes of the story. Mental illness is such a complex disease, so complicated and difficult.  Family members become so frustrated. They seem to be unable to help their loved ones.  I thought his mother was a true rock. Real but frightening.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app on kindle fire hd, but updates too late! C,mon amazon! First the actual app being late, then 6.0 now 0.7 and 0.7.3
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved the season and was disappointed that there were not more episodes! The picture on Amazon prime came in great!
0399159347|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Moriarty's for the last few years - ever since reading and loving Moriarty's debut novel, [[ASIN:0060586133 Three Wishes: A Novel]]. This Australian author has a real knack for creating likable, realistic characters and putting them in interesting relationships and scenes. And this, her fifth and most recent novel, is no exception! With an enticing title, and an engaging storyline - this book quickly becomes nearly impossible to put down. Moriarty hits the right tone, and the book, despite its flowered cover, explores deeper and darker topics than most books in the \\"chick lit\\" genre. And with talk of iPads and apps, this book has a sleek, modern feel to it. The first few chapters may feel a bit overwhelming, though. Moriarty introduces her wide cast of characters straightaway, and though they eventually all come together, it takes a little time before connections between the three separate main characters to be apparent.<br /><br />Cecelia is a mother of three daughters, and prides herself on her organization and how effortless she makes things in her busy life of running a Tupperware business and being the head parent in the school's association. Rachel lives in Sydney as well, and she is a grandmother who works at the same school, and who lives a life feeling separate from everyone other than her much adored two year old grandson. And lastly, Tess, is a woman with a young son and runs a business along with her husband and best friend/cousin in Melbourne. As these lives all intersect (largely thanks to the Berlin Wall), the book becomes a downright page-turner. Moriarty manages to keep her large cast of characters each feeling realistic and quite distinct.<br /><br />I absolutely could not put the book down! It is easy to become invested in these characters lives and despite the satisfying epilogue, I still wasn't ready to truly say goodbye to them. I am already looking forward to Moriarty's next novel! She is such a talented writer! This one has some real surprises in its plot and nicely balances out the darker sides of humanity with the complexities of love. It is such an enjoyable and engaging read! I hope the wait isn't too long for another wonderful novel from the author!one has some real surprises in its plot and nicely balances out the darker sides of humanity with the complexities of love.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved the creativity and variety that this game offered. It made me want to go see the movie again. FUN
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The book was really easy to read. I really wasn't sure about the book when I first started but it kept hooking me to read more. I can't wait to get started on the second one!!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|It had a good story line and I enjoyed it very much. I wanted to watch more of the show.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|Strong Cast, amusing fantasy love comedy.  Great screenplay, witty repartee between players.  Enjoyed the action as well.  Will watch again
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am not happy but not sad! still a great writer and great read.<br />just hate that I paid so much for such a small piece of the story.
B00004YTIQ|5.0|Works good and helps heat the water in the pool, keeps it clean too. Stays on really well and fit over the pool perfectly.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is good when I'm board I play it and almost every day it lets u show ur creative side and go to other lands and play with townspeople
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is the most vivid and authoritative account of the historical personage of Jesus that I've ever read. I was hooked in the first few pages by Reza Aslan's cinematic description of the Temple in Jerusalem and his wonderfully efficient summary of the Roman occupation of Palestine and the Jewish revolt.
140006922X|5.0|Aslan is a good writer and enjoyed his book very much!Must read if you have any interest in history and politics.
6304639457|5.0|Fleetwood Mac delivers a top-shelf performance. From the band performing the classics to Buckingham's two solo performances, it's all good.
B00915G6NK|1.0|I watched this show until this season, and finally had to quit because of Deeks' character.  He is so nasty-looking, juvenile, annoying, and all-around intolerable I could no longer stand to see him for even a minute.  I really enjoy the rest of the cast, and this could be a good show if not for Deeks.  He constantly hits on Kinsey, has a very unfunny, stupid even, sense of 'humor', and worst of all he looks like you can smell him from a block away.  Is he really what the producers think an LA undercover cop would be like?  I mean, come on, really?<br /><br />I'm writing this review hoping that people from the show read this and get a clue.  I feel so strongly about this I emailed the show about either please cleaning him up, and growing him up, or getting rid of him.  Such a shame, too.  If they'd get rid of him, who knows, maybe they'd get a couple more people to watch...<br /><br />I turn my tv off when NCIS goes off.  Nothing more to see.
3836538725|5.0|Sebastião Salgado is arguably the finest photographer of our time. At the risk of making shallow comparisons, and taking nothing away from acknowledged masters of the landscape image like Ansel Adams, interpreters of the human condition like Lewis Hine and Dorothea Lange, or great animal photographers like Nick Brandt, Salgado stands alone in my mind today for his incredible vision, patience, perseverance and sensitivity to his subjects, which he finds in some of the most remote parts of our planet. He treats all of them with respect and obvious admiration for what they contribute to our understanding of nature and anthropology.<br />Genesis is a contemporary masterpiece and so much more than simply a volume of great photographs. I will be studying its content repeatedly and I will continually gain increased understanding of our world each time I open the book.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was looking through titles of different books and came across this one. I read the reviews and thought interesting but still wasn't sure. I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. The way Riggs described the scenes it's like your there and can see it also. I'm glad there will be a second book because I was left with questions and wanting to know what will happen now. January won't come fast enough.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|for all you Cinderella fans that have been waiting an eternity for his solo album it has been worth the wait. Tom produces a great album. He proves he is still relevant in this competitive industry. Good bluesy & country tunes. Recommend
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|This is not your typical sci-fi, though the motif of clones keeps us thoroughly in something just beyond the everyday, which is nice since the series takes place in Canada, now. With so many twists and turns, it would be hard to summarize the show, but if you're looking for something that is not even REMOTELY like anything else on TV, this is it. It keeps you guessing, keeps you involved, keeps you rooting for the main characters, even when they're not necessarily likable. Tatiana Maslany should never have been snubbed for a best actress nomination for this year's Emmys. Watch a couple of episodes and you'll see why. Watch one episode and you'll be hooked.
0062238868|5.0|I got this for my husband and he was constantly discussing with me and his friends all the trials that a special forces soldier goes through and how they each learn to cope with the tragedies that they experience in their own ways.  Great insight into the life of a hero.  My husband has loaned this book out to his friends and they discuss it all the time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I can't write a review for fear of spoiling anything but all I can say is it starts slow but don't give up cause WOW the second half is a wonderful amazing train wreck you can't loom away from
B000ICXQXI|4.0|My grandson wanted to watch the original movie so I let him.  I told him he would never go into a bathroom without checking behind the shower curtain again.  So now he is afraid and always pulls the shower curtains back, probably not a bad idea anyway as he goes off to camp, etc.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Easy quirky read! I loved it because it took me back. I wish the book would have lasted longer so I would not have been left to wondering...Maybe part 2
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. Denzel's character wasn't what I expected but it was a good watch. I purchased for myself as I like to rewatch some movies. This is one for the collection.
