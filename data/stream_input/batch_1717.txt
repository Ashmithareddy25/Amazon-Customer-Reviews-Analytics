B006LSZECO|3.0|Over all this was a good book. I can see why they put this on the top 11 books you should in ur 20s. I only give it 3 stars because it was so slow in the beginning. I almost didn't make it to the part of the book that was worth reading because of how boring the beginning was. I'm glad I didn't put it down tho because it was def worth the read
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It is bad at downloading and I hate that. it is cool and a fun app but it is sssssssssssoooooooo &ccedil;cccccccooooooollllllllllllllllll
B004I744AS|5.0|Informative and fun. A variety of topics and fun interactive games that inspire. Each topic is clickable allowing the user to delve deeper into the topics. Informative lesser known facts and oddities. Beware that this app is based out of Great Britain so topics change on GMT.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton keeps the secret from the viewer with great skill.  Great reading with suspense leading to the final reveal.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|it. is rediculously hard with that stupid time limit. love the aquariums.  get rid. of the times and would. be 5 stard
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Enjoyed the entire season and was worth the price.  To all you SoA fans..  this is an easy sell.  You know what you are getting.  And this season continues the great story of that MC in that little town of Charming.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At the beginning it to easy but then you become  stressed and  thenyou find yourself racking your brain to solve this puzzles
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and wow I'm so happy I listened, John Green has written a touching story that I'm sure to recommend to my other friends too!
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Fast Delivery, In Great condition! Very Satisfied. Good Movie. I would watch a second time. Second movie was good, but I think this first one was a little better.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This app is amazing! :) It has alot of cool features that is similiar to somewhat an electric piano, but the keyboard has ALL the keys so it's perfect! :)<br /><br />10000+ stars up! :D
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great way to waste time!  Hours of fun and if you don't mind waiting the regen time, no extra $$ required for playing.  Also have this on my ipad and ipod.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was not the best book by John Grisham I've read.  It was slow getting started and I didn't find it as spell binding as most of his books.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|If all of the singers were to burn in about the first 15 min of the movie then I would of given 5 stars.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Songs with terrific lyrics. Band musician quality excellent. Singers fantastic. Fits several genre in 2012. Even re-makes of older songs are welldone with a fresh approach.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham,s books and they are books you cannot put down.Afer reading this one I can probely take the Bar Exam and pass it
B002HFJ77S|5.0|This was one of the funniest books I've read in a long time. I found myself laughing hysterically throughout the entire book. Sophie Kinsella is a brilliant writer. You won't regret buying this book!
B008S80OU2|3.0|This is an incredible collection.  All the Columbia recordings remastered with a much improved sound.  I would have loved to see it released on vinyl as well, but it is what it is.<br />Regretfully the 4 concerts bonus download site is not working.  I have tried on 3 different PCs and on all of them it says the website does not exist.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I couldn't even open this.  Don't waste your time.  My anti-virus app. detected a virus as soon as the download completed.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very competent application. Meets your needs very well. No other real feedback to offer. No freeze, no lag. Plenty of options. Recommended by me and you can take that to the bank!
B008NABUU8|4.0|Great way to kill some time when you need to be waiting for something. I would recommend it to a friend.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I've followed the whole series and have found that with each book the writing has gotten better and better, with the last four being the best.  I am absolutely not going to give anything away or give a brief synopsis.  I loved this book.  The development of the character throughout has been great and can't say much more or I'll ruin the read from anyone else.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Outrageous book. Should be required reading in any and all schools. Should be dumbed down for High schools, but \\"as is\\" for higher learning. Was recommended to me, and I would/will do the same. !!<br />Slightly wordy(long-winded), and repetitious of themes, but emphasis was in fact justified anyway.<br />Was eye-opener regarding farming activity details and insight. Wish more farmers were like his examples..<br />17$ well spent.<br />edit:<br />weeks later:<br />still getting thoughtful flashbacks<br />months later..still recommending it .
B008D19WBQ|1.0|As a Friends fanatic, I am extremely disappointed, to say the least, that the Blu-Ray version does not contain the full episodes. Will definitely NOT be purchasing this set, however would have gladly forked over twice as much for the full episode versions on Blu-Ray.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have been reading NDE books since Raymond Moody's book was first published. I enjoyed this book especially because of the professional background of the writer. Although I've never had any doubts...knowing this neurosurgeon has the capacity to enlighten many critics to the truth, was fulfilling in itself. His journey was unique and the visuals were  beautiful.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I said I wouldnt pay for another app for a while but I got so happy to see a kindle fire edition that I jumped the gun.  I'm very unhappy with it and am kicking myself that I wasted money on it.<br /><br />The picture quality is bad. The lighting is bad - it kept flickering from light to dark like a strobe light.<br /><br />When I put it on video, I changed the quality to 1080p first thing before even trying the lower quality first. I'm not even sure it would work as every time I try to take a video, the app crashes.<br /><br />The icons for camera, video, etc, seemed to &quot;jump&quot; at times.<br /><br />I very much regret buying this app - esp when I forgot about the GoToApp Demo that gives me easy access to the camera. There are other ways to access it, too.<br />I blame Bush for my mistake!
B004I8WD6E|3.0|Should have purchased darker case looks much nicer than clear case. Again screen protector was very thin and would prefer thicker protector.
B005FNJL7K|4.0|I received this CD for a recent birthday. I had waiting (and quited annoyed) that they hadn't released this CD yet. The DVD about the symphony has been around for years, but you couldn't buy a recording of the symphony itself? Bizarre.<br /><br />This actual recording is very well done. The orchestra performs great, and makes for wonderful background music during some of my more mundane tasks at work.<br /><br />My big problem is with the composition itself. As others have pointed out, this recording follows the original order of the movie. Isn't that what the soundtracks are for? I would have LOVED a true rearrangement of the music into a more typical symphony format; each movement dedicated to one of the beautiful theme's that Howard Shore has written. That would have gone a long way to help bridge our clearly talented movie composers with traditional classical music, something I'd love to see more of in the future.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it is awsome it is the only clock that wakes me up the music i choose is awsome i love this app how can it be free?!?!?!
B0085RQLXK|2.0|I've been listening to Aerosmith since their very first album and while like I don't to compare any group's albums to past efforts, this time it's hard not to especially since the band has made such a fuss about returning to their roots.  Choke, choke.  I hope they're not serious.  While this could have been a great album, Aerosmith decided to ride the coat tails of their former past , more current, albums and try to recapture those moments.  For me, I'm just not seeing too much good in this.  Where is the rock and where is the rawness?  Don't see it.  All I see is mediocre rock at best with a lot of sappy ballads thrown in for good measure.  While Tyler has never spurned ballads, these don't even compare to tunes such as 'You See Me Cryin' or 'Home Tonight' from 'Toys in the Attic' and 'Rocks'.  Best track for me on this album seems to be 'Freedom Fighter' from Perry.  While fans from the Permanent Vacation' onward days will probably enjoy this album, fans from their early and heyday years will just continue to scratch our heads and wonder whatever happened to the band and why did they sell out.  \\"Pink is my favorite color\\"  Gag!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As with all of Patricia Cornwell novels, I loved it.  Exciting with twists and turns. Can't wait for the next one.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Please fix the app.  It crashes all the time after latest update.  Samsung galaxy s 3 with jelly bean 4.1
B004I8WD7S|4.0|Bought for my wife and she was very happy with the way it looked. The screen protector was to thin. Expected it to be a little thicker than it was.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I'd get the Mass Paperback but I'd have to wait till March. Just couldn't.<br />Wonderful read though. Lots of surprises. At par with the third in the series !
B007MB5OCE|5.0|No spoilers here: read this story. It's odd and moving and human. The characters are flawed and damaged and fun as all get out. Just do it. You'll thank me.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I originally downloaded the \\"free\\" version for my grandson. He is 4 but quickly figured out how to \\"dig\\" through to let the water flow. Helping him through the more difficult parts we became an addicted team!So, I downloaded the full version to my Kindle Fire and we are enjoying further challenges and rewards.
B008KE3960|3.0|This was kinda fun but once a lot of tanks are on the screen and you have a lot of planes, it gets a little confusing. Still, a fun game but a money pit. You have to buy maps unless you are happy with the one that comes with the game. I will probably be uninstalling this free game shortly.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun time, can keep you busy for lots of hours.  The Space Angry Birds is a little difficult and sometimes the rubber band effect doesn't make it all the way around the planet.  Same with under the water game.  But it's fun and gets the aggression out.  Get it.  It's worth it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the graphics are great. I really like this game so far. It very easy to navigate and I like that it doesn't have a lot of ads popping up throughout the game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|this story had alot of twists and turns and was very enjoyable.  i would recommend it to others and also i read it in 3 days.  that should tell you how much i enjoyed it.  John Grisham never has let me down.  very good read
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I was captivated the whole time I was reading this book. Very hard to put down. I loved the mystery and lack of romance..let's just face it ..romance books don't appeal to everyone. Great read for guy or girl.
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|Fantastic story. Lives up to it's expectations. Any Percy Jackson fan will love this book because it is full of all those thing that make up a Percy Jackson book. Action, comedy, suspense and it won't be able to keep it down. The only disappointment is that the starting is a bit slow.
B008VBYN80|4.0|its a cool game its even cool how you can fight and stuff overall a awesome game. although wish it would be a little less expensive
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game. Different puzzles mixed with search and and finds. Great plot. Had a couple jump scares too. I liked how the game made you work like a detective, having to put clues together and such. I got about 4 hours of game play without skipping puzzles or using all hints. Cant wait for the next one!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book was not one I put down.  I loved it!  Sexy, blunt and more real than others in it's class.  I can't wait for the third installment of this series....
B0087JTAKW|5.0|It was not a book I couldnt put down but perhaps the first book that made me think about everything I did and how important it was to leave the dishes in the sink, the crumbs on the counter and get on the floor with my kids.  I read it a while ago now but it has really really stuck with me!  Each time I get to stressing about running out of time, I let something inconsequential go.  For that, I thank the author - its not something I have ever done well before.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Definitely worth the read!  It was hard to put down.  Wonderful description of the characters and their lives. I loved the surprises throughout the book. Sometimes the timing of each chapter was confusing.  Back and forth a lot, but still a great read!
B008OOYALE|1.0|I hats it not 2 Mins into the game I get a blue screen that will not go away. DO NOT GET IT
B003O86FMW|5.0|Saw the first movie and became a fan so I wanted to read the next two books before the movies comes out.<br />When I went to see the hunger games all I heard was how much better the book was.<br />So far I'm enjoying the story and can't wait for the movie!
B008D19WBQ|5.0|This is an amazing collection. Beautifully done. Fascinating extras. There's a whole new younger generation that has rediscovered this show and I think they will flip for this. Best of all, it seems like a Christmas present that anyone would be happy to receive and that makes my life a lot easier.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Enjoying the Brat Pack once again. My daughter has grown fond of the 80's Brat Pack.  She is only 17, but loves this stuff.  She said you can't own Breakfast Club, without owning Sixteen Candles!  :)
0062206281|5.0|\\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\" is considered an YA novel by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, but it will captivate adults as well as teens.  I enjoyed this book as much or maybe even more than \\"The Shadow of the Wind, the first in the series.\\"  Fermin, Daniel, and other characters are transported back to the 1940`s.  The retelling of the horrors of prison, poverty and tyranny of the leaders of the time are vividly portrayed. This is balanced with the telling of love tenderness and friendship. I have become captivated by his books, which include \\"The Angel's Game\\" following \\"The Shadow of the Wind.\\"  The descriptions of Barcelona in the forties to sixties is fascinating and makes me want to plan a trip to this famous old city. Zafon's characters have taken on their own lives in my imagination and I find them well developed and believable. It would be a pleasure to visit Daniels father's bookstore as I can only imagine the treasures you would fine.<br /> I recommend Zafon's books but would suggest that the readers begin with \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" and continue to follow the books as they develop. Zafon's novels have been translated into 50 different languages and it is easy to understand why this has been done. A wonderful YA book
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it has many different games. it is so much fun to play you whole play it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Easy read, suspense, kept me up to finish it. Grisham seems to be losing even more confidence in the justice system.<br />Characters developed very well, good descriptions of  prison life, FBI and police lack of co-operation. Good book.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|John Grisham is a superb writer.  The only problem is I read too fast.  This book lasted two sittings only :(
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I took me a little while to get into this book because of the older English language.<br />However, once I got by this hurdle, I found the book very enjoyable.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|My daughter is a giant Beatles fan, she's only 17 and I think she owns every album they ever put out. So this was a must for her to own.
B007THA4FI|4.0|A small English village populated by strong characters with all the flaws and insecurities endemic to the human race...blended in a highly contested political arena...all spiced with the ubiquitous foibles of mankind...It's the perfect recipe for a delightful read. I would highly recommend this book!<br /><br />Love J.K. Rowling's succinct, non-verbose style of writing! She has created a masterful page-turner w/o feeling the need to \\"flower-up\\" every-other sentence. She tells us everything we need to know to comprehensively grasp and enjoy the story, but does so in a concise manner that I thoroughly appreciate!<br /><br />Though I'm not an aficionado of \\"Fantasy\\" fiction, I can certainly understand why the HP series was such a hit. BRAVO to the author for stepping out of her box and creating this tale!...NMR
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 7 year old son loves this app.  He is always wanting my kindle so he can play it.  I like how you have to be creative/strategic about how you place the pieces.  A great way to teach problem solving.  Not just a game, but a great learning tool for young and old.  And a lot of fun too.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Loved the book. Couldn't put it down, I just had to know where he went next. Wonderfully written. Highly recommended.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The Panther features our ole buddy, Det. John Corey, of the Antiterrorism Task Force, who's sarcastic wit does not disappoint. The story is educational, fun, and thrilling. I gave the story 5 stars because I believe this is one of DeMille's very best works.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Outstanding as expected and as promised. Ordered in advance and received on schedule. Sent directly to my Kindle account. There. Is that 20 words?
B007RV6X2Y|1.0|Griffffth!!!! yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!! i can still taste this crap & i am certain Sam, can still taste it. like they say $1.00 make you holler. & if it cost more than that to make this stupid movie, i would be more pissed than i am for paying the $3.99 to watch this distasteful crap. PLEASE!!!! drug test the people responsible for this crap. WHY!!! SHOULD WE SUFFER THE OUT COME...?????????????????????? IT'S COSTING (US) ALL IN THE END...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I keep everything in evermore now. It's my notepad, personal assistant, file manager, diary, recipe book, bookmarker, and many more in one place.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|THIS IS ONE GAME YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF.  GREAT GAME. MAHJONG DELUXE HD  REALLY CHALLENGES YOUR MIND AND YOU CAN'T WAIT TO BEAT YOUR LATEST SCORE.  YOU NEED TO FOCUS AND USE STRATEGIES TO MOVE THE GAME.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This has been the best game I have played on my Kindle Fire. lots of strategy puzzels and tons of hidden objects to find. Good hints all through so you don't have to go searching the web for a walk through guide. I highly reccomend this game.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|And no naughty permissions!<br />Great time waster, with simple controls that &quot;just work&quot;.<br /><br />Fun to play, and doesn't sell you out to the ad companies.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I must have picked a hundred obscure characters and it gets every one of them. My wife proclaimed she had one that would stump the genie. It asked maybe eight questions and guessed The Gerber baby. How the he-- did it guess the Gerber baby?? This app is really nothing short of amazing. It guessed Bruce Dickinson (the singer from Iron Maiden), fictional characters from Bobby Brady to Casper the ghost. I have to give props to the designer for writing this program. Have fun with it!<br /><br />One caveat.. it does ask you every time when it starts if you want to download the newer version. Just skip that as nothing downloads (at least on my Kindle Fire)
B008BIZ06M|4.0|It's another great album that's a continuation of The Offspring sound we've grown to love.  If you've liked previous albums by The Offspring, you won't be disappointed with this one.
B008OOYALE|5.0|lot of fun. easy to play for children and adults. lots of great graphics and great dragons. fun for the whole family.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another gripping novel by John Grisham.  This book sucks you in from the first chapter.  Another book by John Grisham that you just don't want to put down.  A must read!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very handy app. It opens ready to go for s quick numbers check. A very good choice for my needs and free with no ads.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|They asked me to review the book before I get the chance of using it so I don't much to say.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Having read every book Lee Childs has published,I look forward to the author returning to action filled Reacher stories. A Wanted Man consisted of one-third action and two-thirds page filling boredom such as never ending and unecessary local and bad-guy building details.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so much fun and has a bunch of cool things and characters.  the graphics are great too!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|love this movie im so glad that these classic characters are on the big screen i love it i grew up watching all the avengers love it
B007SGLZP8|3.0|You have to read most of \\"The Racketeer\\" before you find out what is really going on -- deliberately on the author's part. You think one thing is happening, but then it turns out to be something else. By the time you get there, you don't care very much. The lead-up to the denouement is too long and not very exciting.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Almost couldn´t stop reading it!  Well written , literature for all ages. Have too much fun .Love the caracters and can´t wait for the other two movies.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Without spoiling anything I have to say, for me this was by far one of the most emotional episodes (S3, E4) I've seen thus far in the Walking Dead. Season 3 has turned out to be such a fantastic season with lots of zombies, good plot lines and twists that keep you wanting more.<br /><br />I am very excited to see where this season ultimatley goes especially after viewing episode 4.
B0093FNZT6|4.0|I waited with great anticipation to read Dr. Alexander's book. when my e-copy arrived i devoured it within a couple of days. I enjoyed the frame of reference in which the book was set, which made sense as I continued to read. Those who have previously seen or heard Dr. Alexander's interviews on his NDE, would not have been surprised by the book. In fact, most of it has been on the internet for several years. I believe Dr. Alexander's goal in writing the book is to broaden the exposure of the general public to evidence that the reductionist understanding of consciousness is flawed. What he experienced in his NDE is nothing new and can be collaborated by thousands of others. What IS novel about his contribution is his grappling with the science of what he experienced. He comes to the conclusion that his consciousness existed outside the brain. Those who are familiar with D. Alexander's life since his NDE will know that he has continued to explore this aspect of himself more fully. He alludes to this when  mentioning others in the \\"consciousness\\" movement, such as those at The Munroe Institute. While his experience is certainly evidence for the autonomy of consciousness, it cannot be construed to be proof, as scientifically defined. This aspect is of no concern to me, as there are things that exist, that are beyond the scope of scientific measurement. Time and space, just to name a couple.
0765316994|4.0|The story checks off almost all the star-trek tropes - doomed red shirted crew members, overly dramatic command staff, implausible successes and decidedly iffy technobable, in fact I think the only thing missing would be a serial womanizing captain incapable of a minor scuffle without loosing his shirt.<br /><br />It's a great story, in familiar surroundings, but from a completely different perspective. Lots of laughs at the ridiculousness of the situations the red shirts find themselves in, and yet manages to maintain a dramatic story with a consistent internal logic.<br /><br />Recommended!
B005PK553C|4.0|Great series. Loved that it was a continuation story. Also liked how they combined horror and kinky.  Like others, I'd like to see this added to Prime streaming.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I loved reading Ms. Moorjani's book.  It is a great reminder to us of just who we really are and what we can accomplish.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|enjoying it so far<br />few quirks that need to be worked out.<br />not the game I was expecting. its a nice sequel game.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was really excited when I saw an adult book published by J.K. Rowling. I even pushed my book club towards reading the book this past month. Unfortunately, all of us have agreed that the book is awful. It is so redundant and goes no where. I just can't bear to finish it. Sorry J.K., better luck next time!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Never read this as a kid so I didn't know the story but I really liked it.  It had a nice message without being preachy about it, makes you want to do good.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fifty Shades Darker, book two of Fifty Shades Trilogy was a very captivating and entertaining account of the growing bond between the characters.  It was nice to read more of a \\"story\\" about the developing relationship and past demons of the parties rather than just about the sexual encounters.  I look forward to getting into the third and final installment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 12 and 8 year old daughters absolutely love this game. Great mobile version of the game. Buy it if you liked the PC version.
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|Our family watches this movie every Halloween and love it! Johnny Depp is an amazing actor!!  The movie is even better on Blu-Ray!!
B009JNXK88|5.0|this game is so simple and so fun.  the only complaint I have is some controls that are a little sticky.
B005LAIIDU|5.0|I came into this movie expecting a fun story, some video game nostalgia, and some beautiful animation. I got all of that, but I also got rich, complex characters with very real motivations and desires. The \\"good guys\\" aren't all good, and the \\"bad guys\\" aren't necessarily *bad* guys as Zangief says. There was so much to enjoy in this movie that even though my wife was unfamiliar with most of the video game references, she still loved it too!<br /><br />And the short film, \\"Paperman,\\" at the beginning . . . simply beautiful. It certainly left us a little misty-eyed.
B00979CS50|5.0|Imagine this: One of the greatest songwriters and guitar players in the history of Rock, who is about to turn 67 years old, records an album with his on-again, off-again Garage Band, and the result is 90 minutes of driving, raw, fuzz-drenched, uncompromising, exuberant, angry, and fierce guitar-drenched jam-rock accented by the typically masterful lyrics of the protagonist...<br /><br />You don't need to imagine it - This is it.<br /><br />I remember reading somewhere that Crazy Horse never once surrendered to the invaders. Still hasn't.<br /><br />Grade: Off the charts...One of the 10 or so best albums I've ever heard.
B009B0CZXU|5.0|Bat for Lashes never disappoints. Wonderful album. For those who are used to \\"Fur and Gold\\" and \\"Two Suns,,\\" \\"The Haunted Man\\" is a little different, but still just as enjoyable. Worth your money and multiple listen-thrus.
B008OOYALE|5.0|very fun and easy to play gives you a chance to earn gold, cool pass time game. great graffics as well and cute setup. i like this a lot. need a easier way to clear space and get food for the gragons but besides that still a very nice game to play. goin in on the fun and watch them grow!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I've had this game on my iphone for awhile and both my daughter and I really enjoy it. there are more updates and different jetpacks/clothing that aren't available on Kindle fire. I make it farther on this version than on my phone, but it may just be because the screen is bigger. it's free so why not try it?
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one the best games I have ever played. I had a blast earning all of the acheivments with my daughter. She is only two but she loved to help me play. while were going on a roadtrip.

0399157565|2.0|One wonders why the title of this book - wait! Perhaps they were trying to gain some readership by confusing people into thinking this was a Kathy Reichs' novel - because the Bone Bed of the title has next to nothing to do with the main meat of the plot. The writing dwelt annoyingly long on unnecessarily technical jargon, Kay dwells inwardly much of the time, she seems insecure in all her relationships. You get the sense that much of her unfinished inward dwelling thoughts are meant to further suspense in the novel, but mainly they annoy. The rehashing of past betrayals along with yet another by an employee right under her nose is also growing old.  I slogged through this book but it is a far cry from the excellent writing of the earliest work with this character. I think her readers have a right to expect better value for their money.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|loved that the author told this story from a 5 years old version.  great job getting that down.  book leaves me with some questions (mostly about Old Nick), but then a 5 year old perspective wouldn't include this. I couldn't put the book down, stayed up later than I should reading.  i love a story where i don't really know where it is going, i couldn't tell where this story would go from chapter to chapter.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|I DID NOT FEEL THIS WAS UP TO GRISHAM'S STANDARDS.  THE PLOT WAS VERY FLIMSY AND HAD NO AUTHENTICITY FACTORS.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Like all of Grisham's novels, it is an excellent work; although I was expecting a different epilogue, I liked it very much.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|There is not much that I can add to the 200+ reviews. However, the gorgeous song (#10 on the album), \\"From There to Back Again\\" summarizes succinctly the evolution of the Beach Boys. Listeners are treated to, as they have been for over 50 years, the sublime, mellifluous vocal harmonies of the Beach Boys. Brian Wilson's genius has been noted in rock history, and despite some wear-and-tear on his voice, his songs do not disappoint.<br /><br />But I would like to emphasize the contributions of Al Jardine. He has been a Beach Boy mainstay since nearly the beginning, but has been vastly overlooked and underrated. Listen to \\"From There to Back Again\\", and you will hear a voice that his remained intact through all these years. I believe he sang lead on \\"Help Me Rhonda\\". Without knowing Al personally, I get the impression that perhaps he was the most mentally healthy of the group while continuing to be an integral part of the Beach Boys, mostly with his harmonies. With Brian, Al, David, Bruce, Mike, (and let's not forget the late Dennis and Carl Wilson), the Beach Boys are one of the great American rock bands. They have been 'there', and Thank God they are 'back again'!

0425263916|4.0|Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: Intense conversations are balanced with energetic sensuality in this steamy romance.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: I loved New York with the kind of mad passion I reserved for only one other thing in my life.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Sylvia Day's second book in the Crossfire series, Reflected in You, picks up immediately after the end of Bared to You. Reflected in You consists of drama, and a lot of it. I want to say that there was a lot more going on in Reflected than in Bared. At first, I didn't exactly know if it was necessarily a good or bad thing, but the events throughout the book quickly altered my feelings.<br /><br />Reflected in You continues to follow the complicated relationship of Eva and Gideon. While Day has progressed their relationship into something resembling normalcy, both Eva and Gideon have a lot of secrets and unknowns. While working on creating a solid foundation to their relationship, they are both faced with new obstacles and insecurities both outside and inside their relationship. But what I've noticed is that while they take a couple of steps towards progress, there is always something that alters their path and forces them to take one back. It's complication and dysfunctional at its best, and Day has added a few steamy scenes to make the readers aching heart feel better.<br /><br />Eva is still as strong willed as ever, and it might be the one thing that hurts her relationship. Not that a woman can't be strong in a relationship, but that her determination and pride could get in the way of seeing the bigger picture and settling for compromise. Her past, her crazy jealous tendencies, and her clouded-by-emotion judgement alters her actions. Eva irked me a little in Reflected in You, and where I thought it was endearing in the first book, left me a little turned off in this one.<br /><br />Gideon is melodramatic and controlling, but I don't think that was anything new. I found out a little more about him in Reflected, some great things and a lot of not so sweet. He's damaged goods and he struggles with that. Eva doesn't give him a break with any of it, and I can see how it affects him. He has gone from a man of power and restraint to someone who is emotional and crass. Gideon reveals a lot of vulnerabilities, mostly to Eva, but it's refreshing altogether.<br /><br />My mind looks for the story, more than the scenes, so I feel disconnected when it gets to the sex scenes. The many words to describe Gideon or the many positions offered by Eva, sometimes it's a little too much. But that's the genre and I will say Day knows her writing. I wish that there were more to the actual story. I felt that there was a cyclical pattern, from an argument of sorts and then a steamy scene. I wanted more questions to be answered.<br /><br />I enjoyed Reflected in You. While I felt there were a few downfalls, I agreed with where Day took the characters. There are dynamic shifts in the personalities and relationships that make the story interesting. Day takes a psychological approach to a few things, talking about topics that are always out of the norm. But where there are intense conversations, Day balances it with energetic sensuality. I enjoyed where the characters went and I appreciated where Day took them individually and collectively. I didn't like some scenes, but the positive scenes overshadowed those, definitely. I enjoyed it enough to finish in one sitting, and you know that doesn't always happen.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: Penguin provided me with a copy of Reflected in You. No goody bags, sponsorships, \\"material connections,\\" or bribes were exchanged for my review.found out a little more about him in Reflected, some great things and a lot of not so sweet.

B008K6DU4Y|4.0|I use this on my phone and it is a great program.  But it will not work on the kindle. I am assuming it is due to the operating system on the Kindle. I hope they will fix the Kindle but I don't think they will since the has not been updated since I bought it. It's a shame because it really is a great program.
0812984412|4.0|Cloud Atlas is really 6 novels in one.  Each section takes place in a different time period and each section could be considered a different genre.  The sections are laid out like a bell curve starting in the past, moving towards the future, and ending back in the past. The book is broken into sections as follows:<br /><br />1) The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing: In the 1800's a lawyer travels home to Australia and back to San Francisco on business and observes life in the Pacific and at sea.  Think \\"Master  & Commander\\" or Melville's work.<br /><br />2) Letters From  Zedelghem: 1931 Europe, a rakish composer runs out on his debts and leaches off the more well to do. Think Hemingway's \\"A Moveable Feast\\"<br /><br />3) Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery: 1970's California, a reporter finds trouble when she looks into the wrongdoings of a corporate giant. Think \\"Chinatown\\".<br /><br />4) The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish: Present day. A publisher falls down the rabbit hole when he ends up in a nursing home. Think a funnier \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\" without the drugs.<br /><br />5) An Orsion of Sonmi-451: In the future a fabricant finds her soul. Think \\"Blade Runner\\".<br /><br />6) Sloosha's Crossin' An'  Ev'rythin After:  The distant future, where  what's old is new again. Think H.G. Well's \\"The Time Machine\\".<br /><br />Each section is independent though loosely linked together with one or more of the others.  Many if not all of the sections play with issues of good versus evil, virtue versus viciousness, selfishness versus being selfish, right from wrong, and how choices made in the past or present will affect the future.  The flow of the book can be considered a Jacob's Ladder.  The following interpretation of which is taken from Wkiipedia:<br /><br />The Hellenistic Jewish Biblical philosopher Philo Judaeus, born in Alexandria, (d. ca. 50 CE) presents his allegorical interpretation of the ladder in the first book of his De somniis. There he givesfour interpretations, which are not mutually exclusive:<br />1) The angels represent souls descending to and ascending from bodies (some consider this to be Philo's clearest reference to the doctrine of reincarnation).<br />2) In the second interpretation the ladder is the human soul and the angels are God's logoi, pulling the soul up in distress and descending in compassion.<br />3) In the third view the dream depicts the ups and downs of the life of the \\"practiser\\" (of virtue vs. sin).<br />4) Finally the angels represent the continually changing affairs of men.<br /><br />All of these themes can be seen in the book.<br /><br />I enjoyed all the sections of the book, and each individually would have made for an interesting book on its own.  Though I am a big sci-fi fan, the middle section of the book which is set in the farthest future, and the only one not broken up into two parts, \\"Sloosha's Crossin' An'  Ev'rythin After\\" , is the part I found the toughest to get through because of the pidgin English used.  Whether or not the sum of the parts is greater or less than the whole is another question, left to the individual reader. Some readers may feel that Mitchell is being overly cute or arrogant, others will like trying to piece together the connecting parts.<br /><br />All in all David Mitchell shows an amazing range and ability to master any genre.  I had never read one of his novel's before, but I am now going to seek out his other work.  The fact that I want to read more or his work is my own litmus test as to how much I enjoyed this book.
B0063B2C5G|5.0|After such heart breaking moments in Season 5 & 6, Season 7 was pure joy to watch. I love Booth & Bone's love story & I cannot get enough. I caught the first six seasons on Netflix & am very thankful to Amazon for giving us the oppertunity to purchase the 7th Season at such an affordable price. I pray this show is on for another 8 Seasons!
B0090CMMIC|5.0|I'm a new fan of this band, but wow was this album amazing!! Every song is just beautiful! Gus's vocals definitely make this band one of the best new ones out there! Highly recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun time killer and you can't beat the price :) This is as good of a version of Solitaire as any I have played.
B0011Z3DK2|5.0|As I grew up with rock of the late 60's and up I have never gotten tired of the classics. Houses of the Holy is one of Led Zepplin's most outstanding accomplishments. It is a showcase of their talents into something other than just \\"hard rock\\". the orchestration of songs on this album show that rock can be more than \\"scream, shout and jump about\\".
B0095R64AO|3.0|I downloaded this movie on my Kindle Fire, a first for me. The story line was cute, but the constant use of the \\"f\\" word was ridiculous. The same story could have been told without it. Maybe Amazon should think about offering airplane movies without the language! I would certainly watch a lot more movies if I didn't have to be subjected to the bad language.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The book is written very conversationally and at times feels like Mr. Kyle is sitting next to you telling a story. It is at times funny and heartbreaking. To me, the most interesting aspects of the book are not necessarily the combat scenes, but the contributions by Mrs. Kyle and the preparation that goes into the missions described. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the first hand view of a SEAL's life and of a Iraq war veteran's life.
0486266885|5.0|We read this book in a freshman lit class and its a great book. That shows good vs evil. Its well written but it has a very confusing ending with very big words in the end.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|Well it's not a return to form like \\"Get A Grip\\" like I originally thought. Matter of fact it's not a great album at all and I doubt WILL NOT return the bad boys from Boston to new commercial heights! Here's the breakdown!<br /><br />1) Luv XXX (5 stars) Too bad the whole album isn't this good. This is the best Aerosmith jam I've heard since the 70's (reminds me of Rocks). Surprisingly awesome song!<br /><br />2) Oh Yeah (4 stars) Another pretty good song, bluesy, good guitar work. It's just a bit generic sounding (like you could get sick of it fast). But a pretty good tune none the less!<br /><br />3) Beautiful (1 star) I don't like this song at all, off tempo, off key, boring, and stupid!<br /><br />4) Tell Me (2 stars) The first of many generic boring ballads. We've heard these before and much better!  There is just nothing special about this song!<br /><br />5) Out Go The Lights Bluesy (2 stars) Funky, but boring! I do not like all this this off tempo, off key stuff at all. The background vocals also become VERY monotonous as well as does the reprise that follows it over and over in this song! This long extended overdrawn ending is also totally not necessary!<br /><br />6) Legendary Child (4 stars) I liked VERY much since the first time I heard it. It's an unused cut off of Get A Grip. Even the unused piece from the album is better than most of the new album!<br /><br />7) What Could Have Been Love (2 stars) Power ballad #2, could be the same exact song we heard from a previous Aerosmith album, just a different name. This is formula all the way, boring!<br /><br />8) Street Jesus (5 stars) An amazing jam where they came up with this I don't know? Worthy to sit with their 70's catalog AGAIN too bad there aren't more great songs on this album like this and a couple others! I LOVE this song!!!<br /><br />9) Can't Stop Loving You (1 star) Steven Tyler hits a new low with Power ballad #3 with a country feel and a duet with Carrie Underwood. This is just terrible, Tyler should have never put the Aerosmith name on this crap!<br /><br />10) Lover Alot (4 stars) A pretty good jam, I don't like it as well as Street Jesus, Luv XXX, or Legendary Child but it ranks next in line. A very good rock song for Aerosmith! Very catchy!!<br /><br />11) We All Fall Down Man (2 stars) Power ballad #4, about as bad as the others; slow, boring, yawn!<br /><br />2) Freedom Fighter (3 stars) One of Joe's two song leads. The song is not great by any means, and well he just isn't Steven Tyler. The oh oh oh oh oh which was meant to be catchy just doesn't do anything for me! However, the end guitar solo is pretty good!<br /><br />13) Closer (1 star) Each ballad gets worse than the last, man this stuff is killing this album!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />14) Something (1 star)  A pretty bad song sung by Joe Perry, this just doesn't get it for me!<br /><br />15) Another Last Goodbye (2 stars) Ballad #6 (yea no joke), this one is a little different sounding, some unique instrumentation and what it really serves is the close out for the album.<br /><br />There you have it. 2 KILLER new Aerosmith songs, 3 VERY good ones and the rest of an album of MOSTLY GARBAGE!  Overall the new album is terrible considering all the bad material. Do yourself a favor, but this one track by track!  In a way I am even surprised Aerosmith came up with some good new songs in 2012!  Would have made a good EP.  But taking my rating from each song and dividing it into 12 came out 3.25 stars.  But like I said most of the album is terrible, but the good songs are very good!

B002SR2PKG|5.0|\\"It\\" is in the same arena as \\"The Stand\\" in my mind. The both have some great horror moments in them, but it's the little things that stay with you after it's been read.<br /> I'll not say much about the plot because most people know it by now and if you don't then I envy you your first read.<br /> The novel plays tricks with time showing the past and present at the same time. The past is the summer that all kids wish they could have, that is till IT shows up. We get to know the group of kids who will square off against the beast twice in their lives in both the present sense and in the past sense. They are a ragged group of \\"losers\\" who band together to stop a group of bullies, almost as bad as the monster is, and find they have power when they band together.<br /> As we meet the kids as their older selves we find that the first battle with IT has left them all scared. we also learn it's not over and they must face the creature again.<br /> for such a large book it's the quiet moments that ring true with me. Childhood pain, adult indifference, and burying the ghost of the past is a messy job, but it must be done. I love the out and out horror of the novel, but the small moments, watching a movie with friends, finding something that the adults don't see or want to see, learning that truth and facts don't mean the samething, and the small day to day trival stuff that sets this story apart. At least for me, the moments between the horror are what makes the monster and the fight so much more scary.<br /> This is for me at least one of King's last great novels in a long time. It has a heart that is missing in most of his later work, and it has IT!
B009JNXK88|5.0|I really love this simple old school like game.  I didn't think touch screen controls would do well for this type of game,  but I am pleasantly surprised.  I was in love with Super Meat Boy on xbox live, and this game fulfills my craving.  Thanks for for the free game,  it is definitely worth buying!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|It. was a little boring before they added the multiplayer game and now my kids have a blast! 5 stars for sure!
B007C3TVNA|5.0|Lynne Ramsay writes this screenplay from the novel of the same name by Lionel Shriver, then turns to directing \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\".  I was held astounded and mortified throughout this very dark and disturbingly brave portrait of unbridled evil.  At the movie's time of 49:18, I found it necessary to pause it just to catch a breath as my emotions were running wild for this mother; empathy, fear, suspicion, bewilderment ...<br /><br />Tilda Swinton (Eva) pours-out a brilliant, emotionally exhausting portrayal of a mother who, in my estimation, never had a chance with the force that drove her son Kevin (Ezra Miller).  She relentlessly tries everything that a mother can possibly do.  I could find neither fault nor blame in her character while I constantly scrutinized this play out for a point, or situation, that it could have turned for the better.<br /><br />This work is done amazingly well with its metaphoric red symbolism carried throughout. It may be visually tiring, although I thought that it was meant to carry this breathless pacing. It starts shockingly at the beginning and continues to the point of losing any possible hope for its conclusion; the point you no longer see red.  This fragmented and flashback style, especially in the first half, is well shown through the cinematography of Seamus McGarvey.<br /><br />The soundtrack (Jonny Greenwood's Original Score) may come under fire for some 'odd' or 'unusual' song choices, mainly in the beginning. Although, for myself, it made a lot of sense as the story went forward.  Its beginning is in the time when Eva is flashing back to all that has happened and is living on sort of an autopilot; completely drained and traumatized. The folk-song type selections concerning a mother's love, add to the total confusion of what Kevin is doing to Eva.  I found it a little off, at first, then correctly confusing and thematically dichotomous. It mockingly lends to the question; What the heck is going on?<br /><br />Eva and husband Franklin (John C. Reilly) present two different relationships with their son, starting from birth then to the younger-age Kevin (an astounding Jasper Newell).  Franklin keeps trying to support his wife although never sees with his own eyes any peculiar behavior from his son, only hears everything that is wrong with Kevin from Eva.  Kevin remains manipulative and conniving in his actions toward Eva and is obviously enjoying her reactions of pain and utter bewilderment.  Eva is silently screaming \\"help me\\" throughout this while going unnoticed by her husband, although, it is obviously picked-up and run-away with by Kevin.<br /><br />Once Kevin is in the teen years, Ezra Miller (\\"Another Happy Day\\", \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\") takes over and does a tour-de-force of extremes in a cruel and bizarre manner towards his mother.  With Miller's facial expressions and mannerisms which are so wickedly ominous it is obvious, once again, just how much he is enjoying this ... her pain.<br /><br />One understands, from the outset, that nothing good will come of this. Noticing the clock on the bedside table change from 12:00 to 12:01, we are forebode with the idea of what could transpire in just one minute ... and does.  As Kevin takes his final bow, everything comes full circle in the horrific unraveling of a family.husband Franklin (John C.

B0098VYKSA|4.0|I rented this movie from Amazon and really liked it ... I was surprised at how much I liked in fact.  I wish Amazon would let you put the cost of rental towards the purchase price of movies if you buy within 24 hours of renting.  If they did, I would have bought this movie.  If you are considering renting or buying, I would buy.
0425263908|3.0|This is a good book if you liked the fifty shades of grey series... But I don't think it was better than that series. Nothing can really top \\"Fifty Shades\\", in my opinion... But this book is worth the read if you're looking for a book in a similar genre.
B007V65R54|5.0|His writing is plain, but the book makes up for it. Nate weaves back and forth between sports, political polling, gambling, science, and statistics pointing out the common themes of stats while giving stories of success and failures.  He was 50/50 for predicting the 2012 election on the electoral college.  He got 49/50 right in 2008, so he is an authority on stats.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I ordered this book on a whim and I'm glad I did. I absolutely could not put this book down.  I saw that there were some complaints as to how long the book was, but I think it was a perfect length and all of the detail that King added was fine. I laughed and I cried (oh did I cry...) but I was never freaked out by anything. This is not that kind of book. I finished reading it about 3 weeks ago and still think about it daily. It also makes one think about how one little action in life, like ordering a milkshake, can set a whole tidal wave of other actions into existance....<br /><br />I recommend this book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is great! Lots of puzzles that ll have you saying \\"just one more then I'll stop\\" a million times. Plus the ads are small and not a bother. Great app!

B0029LHW4U|4.0|Well, as contrary to my other musical reviews in which I tell of great bands that sold out and with one horrible record ruined their legacies. Only to follow up those horrible records with worse and worse ones that echo their decline.  This one is more positive. A once great band that lost their lead singer Layne Staley to drugs. A fitting and familiar fate for many in that northwest scene. Mark Lanegan (from the legendary band Screaming Trees) has said it many times that he doesn't know how he survived and lived through it all. Many of his friends, such as Layne, are casualties. Well AIC went on.<br /><br />Alice \\"N Chainz put out a pretty respectable record here in 2009 with a new lead singer (who is black). He will go nameless because his vocal contribution is rather faceless in itself. Strangely enough, he sounds very similar to Layne and Jerry. Probably by design. On a few tracks they give him the night off and let Jerry sing it through. But on others, the new singer gets to shine and is definitely adequate. No Layne, but the music really makes up for any vocal letdowns.<br /><br />This record sounds like a combination of all their previous work, drawing most from their last album, the self titled release. All in all, a 4 star rating suffices because every record they did until now was a 5 besides Jar Of Flies which I give a 2 at best (acoustic mess of toned down formulaic garbage) and Sap (their first grunge record that is also acoustic and very formulaic)  which is a 3 to be fair. Otherwise the band kept a high level of intensity material up for most of their existence.<br /><br />Will they make another album, who knows? But their old and new fans will be buying. Even if they don't still get played on the radio as if it were still the 90's :P But it's your decision...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|2nd best episode of all time. Wish they would kill the kids though. Carl is a bad actor. Please kill him off soon!
B009PAETCG|1.0|at first I thought the game would be fun since I am a soccer player but there was a glitche so it just brought me to the app store. horrible do not purchase.
B003V40SGS|5.0|This movie was very fascinating to me as an 80s kid.  Watching it again now just makes me think this movie is still better than 80% of the current so called scifi movies.  There's something about modern day cgi that just takes the feel out of movies these days.  That and this movie had a good script and good actors.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I was suppose to wait for the paperback but when it went out as e book, i tried my best to buy kindle fire or whatever e reader that i could have. Luckily, i did remember that i did have kindle on my mobile and so the reading began. I was so excited for this sequel, i liked bared to you but i loved reflected in you. In reflected in you, it was more intense. the scenes was executed pretty well. There was always surprises, revelations about the each main characters past. Gideon was a bit confusing at the middle of the story but at the end of it, the reasons were revealed. Eva she is just one tough chick, funny-strong witty all in one girl. I really did enjoyed the book, there was so much love.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The type of writing that made john Grisham a world class author.  When I see a John Grisham book, I always purchase it immediately.  This is one of his better stories.
B000FCK42M|5.0|Loved it, my favorite of any of the Winslow books that I have read,  the length of the book was a tad long but I enjoyed the book so much I did not want it to end.
B009JNXK88|5.0|The best side scrolling platformer for Android. As others have said, it's super meat boy plus action for your phone. A highly underrated, unknown gem for Android, I couldn't even find it on the play store! Their loss. Tons of levels and badass classic music too!
B0035YDM4Y|5.0|Fantastic read. Couldn't put it down. It gave me a new respect for the brave men who put their lives on the line for our freedom. Thank you to the American families who sacrifice so much for world freedom. Also to the Afghan people who are not Taliban, but just want what the rest of us want. Peace.
B00992CF6W|4.0|best app ever!! worth the money!! 10 stars for sure!! just one part where your items are it flashes and is hard to see but barely does that. have had issues where the whole app freezes and have to reboot my kindle but works after that. you should get it!
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Loved it.  Like Sylvia's writing but not the paranormal .  This though was a great book.  One of those books you don't want to end because I enjoyed it so much
B0083GQKQG|3.0|Something was pretty much wrong with Kevin from birth, yet nobody listened to the mother, or to Kevin's cry for help and actions. This child should have received help from a toddler. Daddy spoiled, and mommy resented. We need to talk about arresting parents for children who turn out like this, but the parent never seeks out help for them.<br /><br />If you seek out help for your child, and things still go wrong, who can blame you? But if you ignore the obvious, too caught up in your own life, and your child commits horrendous crimes, YOU should join them in jail, and throw away the key on the lot of you!<br /><br />Overall, interesting movie.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Bazaar to say the least.  A really contrived story that leaves you at the end with the feeling you have just been had.  Sorry I read it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Had trouble keeping the plot in focus, but it came together at the end -- typical of Grisham. Not up to his usual \\"thriller\\" mode, but he admitted that he had some difficulty staying with it.

0425263908|3.0|I was told that this was the book to read after 50 Shades so i bought it and delved. I have to say 10 pages in i was beginning to get disappointed and by the first sex scene, yeah, i muddled through. Disappointing. The writing style is certainly superior and the characters are interesting but the whole story felt disjointed to me, there was no effortless flow. While 50 Shades was simple, i couldn't put it down, this book took me about a week to read when normally i'd read something like this in a day. If i had to describe the sex scenes i'd call it mad gorilla love. It wasn't sensual or erotic or torturous and slow, making you salivate for the next paragraph. I skipped through bits of it as it was a turn off for me. The story has great promise though. I just wish the scenes in general all integrated a little better. I don't even know if i want the new book. I did pre order it but when i read this..i cancelled.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|please do not download this app!!!! It has caused nothing but trouble. This is the second time i have tried this app and this experience was worse than the last. Originally I had set up a youverse account but the app never let me login to it to use the app. this time around the app would not even let me create an account. One of my friends has this app and she has linked it to here facebook and it works fine. I don't think i should have to publicize my religious beliefs in order to use this app.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I had to wait 11 years for this album, and boy it worth the wait! They still sound like classic rock but not old. It's just pure pleasure to listen to Aerosmith's music. Not all the songs are fantastic, but in nobody's album all the tracks are impeccable. Anyways, the album in total is over the top, it is just Aerosmith, and it is great. Happy to see Bad Boys from Boston, still rocking and still sound great.

B003JTHESA|5.0|The fifteenth (!) full-length studio album from England's Iron Maiden is a fantastic one. It is easily the band's finest work of the new millennium, and may also darn well be the best record they have released since \\"Powerslave.\\" Hence, this 2010 release is portentously-entitled \\"The Final Frontier,\\" but if it indeed turns out to be the last album of Maiden's career, then at least the band's fans can rest easily knowing that they went out on one-heck-of-a high note. Frontman Bruce Dickinson's vocals sound as top-notch as ever, and the band's guitarists (Adrian Smith, Dave Murray, and Janick Gers) clearly brought their A-game, as well. They let fly truckloads of crunchy, confrontational riffs, strong, propulsive leads, and solos that are nothing short of being positively astounding.<br /><br />But no matter how good the musicianship may be, the one thing that is perhaps most important, is the fact that the songwriting is much improved. Yes, \\"The Final Frontier,\\" may continue in the same vein as all of Iron Maiden's most recent albums (2006's \\"A Matter Of Life And Death,\\" 2003's \\"Dance Of Death,\\" and 2000's \\"Brave New World\\"), in that the songs are very epic and expansive. (The average song length is well-over five minutes, with several of the tracks being anywhere from eleven-to-fourteen minutes long, and only one of them clocking in at less than five minutes.) But unlike what was the case on \\"A Matter...\\", none of these tunes ever overstay their welcome, dragging on too long, and/or making the listener feel almost a little bit antsy by the time they're over. As a result, \\"Final Frontier\\" is a fully-satisfying, fulfilling, and rewarding listen. And its total playing time might be well-over seventy minutes long, but it will actually leave any hardcore Maiden fan wanting more.<br /><br />\\"Satellite 15\\" kicks the record off with a progressive drum solo followed by a fuzzy, grumbling electronic bass line, thus creating a very atmospheric and moody vibe. But then, around four-and-a-half minutes in, the song abruptly switches gears, adopting a heavy, bobbing guitar hook while Bruce's stellar vocals soar overhead. The song is not complete, however, without an anthemic chorus and a lengthy, twiddly, and positively air-guitar-able soloing section (which is well worth rewinding at least once, and listening to again). \\"El Dorado,\\" with its bass intro, catchy, galloping beat, crunchy, churning riffs, and couple of terrifically ripping, trade-off solos, (and not to mention its huge, epically soaring choruses and strong, propulsive bass line that flows throughout) is a strong follow-up. As is \\"Mother Of Mercy,\\" which starts out as a power ballad with warm acoustic guitars and supple crooning, before changing gears and trafficking in belligerent guitar riffing and another winding, shredding solo. And all the while, Bruce is heard wailing away about war, dying, and the \\"angel of pain.\\"<br /><br />\\"Coming Home\\" marries muscular guitar leads with excellent, crystalline-sounding prog-rock soloing, and tacks on another round of really memorable, soulfully-sung choruses for good measure. \\"The Alchemist\\" sounds almost like it could be a Judas Priest outtake, as it boasts a heavy, galloping beat, propulsive, chugging guitar and bass lines, fiery, shredding solos, and falsetto singing. The number is also of note for being the album's shortest song, clocking in at a relatively brief four minutes and thirty seconds. \\"Isle Of Avalon,\\" however, is not only another standout; it might very well be the set's biggest standout. It is highlighted by both progressive and heavy riffing, deliciously melodic leads, a wonderful solo section (the guitarists trade off three or four wonderfully melodic, even vaguely jazzy-sounding solos), and a steady, melodic, humming bass line. \\"Isle Of Avalon\\" is so complex, epic, and multi-faceted that it might not exactly be a tune that the listener can hum along to; but it is also one where you won't mind that it cracks the nine-minute mark (!) at all.<br /><br />But that is not to say that a song like \\"Starblind\\" is even a little bit shabby. It augments its proggy soloing with heavy, crunching licks, a wailing, ascending and dive-bombing solo, and a wealth of textbook/classic Iron Maiden-esque dual guitar harmonies. Next comes \\"The Talisman,\\" which begins as a docile power ballad for the first two-and-a-half minutes or so (meaning it has lovely acoustic strumming, infectious melodic crooning, and noteworthy lyrics.) But then the track slams into heavy, crunchy, driving territory with soaring power metal vocals and sub-speed-metal-esque pacing. Sure, there are plenty of clean, harmonic guitar leads, present here, but there are also borderline thunderous rhythms and really deft and dexterous drum fills. And Bruce's vocals are especially infectious near the end of the song. \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\" works very similarly, beginning as a dreamy power ballad before the electric guitars come thundering in, uncorking some chunky licks and a ton of shredding, melodic, and very air-guitar-able leads and solos. And so does the set closer, \\"When The Wild Wind Blows,\\" which opens with an ambient intro (complete with a pretty, unplugged string arrangement and an accompanying melodic bass line), before eventually becoming a lot heavier (around the two-and-a-half minute mark), and ripping out a bunch of fiery melodic riffs and solos.<br /><br />\\"The Final Frontier\\" is a terrifically epic, infectious, eminently memorable masterpiece with lots of breadth and staying power. As said before, it is the best piece of work that Iron Maiden have come up with since 1984's \\"Powerslave\\" (or, at the very least, 2000's \\"Brave New World\\"). A terrific effort all around from Bruce and the Boys.minute mark (!) at all.<br /><br />But that is not to say that a song like \\"Starblind\\" is even a little bit shabby.

B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell draws you in on page one of her book and keeps you deliciously focused with twists and turns until the very end of the book. You can't believe the story is over and she leaves you wanting more. You quickly go to Amazon to buy her next book. This is the way Bone Bed is written. All the characters are articulate and intermeshed in a way you think you know what is going to happen but it doesn't always happen the way you think. Excellant writer!

B0099KJFJ4|3.0|At the end of the day this is just another direct-to-DVD action movie--but it's a good one.  But Cung Le has some hard-hitting cool fights and, fan or not, Van Damme has a pretty cool role.  However, admittedly, not nearly as much Van Damme as I expected based on the trailer...which was a bummer.<br /><br />Hong (Cung Le; The Man with the Iron Fists, Pandorum) is a soft-spoken fighter who can handle himself pretty damned well.  He takes on four Latin hoodlums by himself just for the Hell of it.  He's not superhuman and the choreography is nothing flashy.  It is, however, brutally \\"practical\\" and, because of that, impressive in its own way.  Although, it's not without a little cinematic flash, fights rarely seem unrealistically one-sided; a rare and good thing.<br /><br />We alternate between two different times: a past when Hong is in jail being mentored by Tiano, and the present when Hong is living his life as a free man.  In prison, Tiano (Jean-Claude Van Damme; The Expendables 2, Assassination Games) transforms Hong from a fighter who studies martial arts to a martial artist who studies opponents.  Disappointingly, all the scenes with Van Damme from the trailer seem to represent the entirety of his screen time in the movie.  Big Bummer.<br /><br />Mr. V (Peter Weller) runs the crime in the town of St. Jude.  He's a farcically over-dressed crime lord who takes a piece of all the action of the local black and latin gangs.  He's smooth, calm and collected most of the time.  But mess with his money and, well...there's a cool scene where he teaches a hooker how to beat up on a sadist.  At the end of the scene, she shows us she appreciated the lesson and that she learned.<br /><br />Hong is a mix of vigilante and criminal but we don't know why.  He obstructs the business of the black and latin gangs which, in turn, affect Mr. V.  He even cleans out a drug den and he never keeps any of the spoils for himself.  Then, by Mr. V's demand, he starts to work with the local gangs and changes the way they run things...no guns, no selling drugs to kids, upping the prices.  This brings in less revenue, but makes the locals of St. Jude feel safe (and that Mr. V is the one who cleaned it up).<br /><br />Hong is eventually double-crossed.  But, like in any Van Damme movie (or Dragonball), the hero must be defeated before retraining and returning victorious.  Hong's training montage is no Van Damme homage, but he still throws a mean kick and even suplexes a guy in the end.  Typically, these martial arts action movies have endings more like videogames than reality, with men favoring fists over firearms and one-on-one at a time over gang tactic combat.  This movie is no different, the finale's outcome doesn't make much sense given the intended goal of the story, and I didn't feel satisfied by it.<br /><br />The victory in this movie is finding Van Damme in a different kind of role (that of the teacher, not the student) and finding Cung Le in a leading role (instead of his often effective supporting roles).  I was entertained and look forward to seeing more of both of them.<br /><br />Director John Hyam (Universal Soldier: Regeneration, Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning) has developed a fine knack for making the most out of humbly budgeted action flicks.  I'm guessing it's just to please JCVD, but among his common actors is Kristopher Van Varenberg (Van Damme's son; Universal Soldier: Regeneration, Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning, Assassination Games) in a tiny role.  I'll let it pass.  If that's what it takes to get this level of Van Damme-ity, it's worth it.ngs and changes the way they run things...no guns, no selling drugs to kids, upping the prices.

I was amazed at this book and had to read it again a month after finishing it to mentally take in all the plot notes that only become apparent after the first reading.  Would have paid the $3 had it not been free at the time I ordered it.  Having read several times in other reviews that a reviewer \\"just couldn't put it down\\" I am now saying the same thing myself! (With BOTH readings!)  Will definitely be reading the follow up work.  Excellent!!!!

B009186E3O|5.0|After many substandard bootleg versions of this film over the years, where the picture and audio leaves much to be desired, this official release is really majestic! This is the longest version I've seen and definitely, by far, the best visually and sound-wise.<br /><br />Ever wished there was a \\"Hard Day's Night\\"/\\"Beatles First U.S. Visit\\"-type film for the Stones? You need look no further. Obviously it leans more toward the \\"First U.S. Visit\\" as it is a strict documentary of the Ireland Tour of September 1965. Each individual Stone is profiled, giving their own unique perspective- Brian Jones being the most telling, which \\"First U.S. Visit\\" never really does. However, you get the fly on the wall feel of \\"The First U.S. Visit\\" with the Stones writing songs- \\"Sittin' On A Fence\\", jamming, goofing around, and even playing Beatle tunes- albeit kind of sillily. The live aspects are excellent with great cuts of each band member live, ala \\"A Hard Day's Night\\"- which are priceless. Charlie actually smiles during the performance, which is a rarity! It also showcases the craziness of fans in multitudes charging the stage and pre-empting \\"I'm Alright\\". Try doing that nowadays and see how fast you will be tackled and removed by security and/or hit with Keith's guitar! No wonder The Stones quit touring for awhile and The Beatles forever. All in all a great snapshot of the Stones early career and well worth your time and money.

B0067EKY7M|4.0|Salmon Fishing In the Yemen is the movie based on the book of the same title by British author, Paul Torday. The movie is well acted: Ewan MacGregor is perfect as Dr Jones (although I thought he would be older) and Emily Blunt was well cast as Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.  Sheikh Muhammad was also well-played by Amr Waked (I imagined him smaller and fatter). I thought that Mary Jones, as played by Rachael Stirling, a little less acerbic that the character in the book, but Kristen Scott Thomas was perfect as the Prime Minister's spokesman. For those who have read the book, the ending comes as a complete surprise as the screenplay does not follow the book at all on many significant points at the end. I think the ending was tailored to movie audiences. It is easy to see how people who did not read the book might make enquiries about actually salmon fishing in the Yemen. The scenery was breathtaking, the dialogue often really witty and, despite the changes, I really enjoyed this movie.

As soon as I open another app, this one stops playing.  *If there's a way to do this, please let me know. :-)<br /><br />Other than that, for a free app, I think this is above average!

B007Y36K46|4.0|This is my favorite Taylor Kitsch movie.  I would put it ahead of \\"The Covenant\\".  And certainly ahead of \\"Battleship\\".  Here he plays the role of John Carter, a character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Although the original novel was written one hundred years ago, Disney has done a wonderful job in adapting the story and the sets to have modern appeal.<br /><br />John Carter is a veteran of the US Civil War.  While prospecting for gold, he takes refuge inside a cave and finds himself transported to Barsoom (Mars).  Because Mars has a lower gravitational pull than Earth,  John Carter is able to use his superior physical strength to jump higher and run faster than the natives.  While in Barsoom, he gets caught up in the power struggle between two powerful factions.  Using his physical abilities, he ends up saving the city of Helium and winning the affections of Princess Dejah.  They end up marrying.  Eventually, he ends up mastering the ability to travel between Earth and Mars.  During his visits to Earth, he relates his adventures to Edgar, his nephew.<br /><br />Once again, I do not want to spoil the story for you.  Suffice it to say that this is a well-made movie.  The special effects are up to the high standards you would expect from a high-budget Disney movie.  The acting performances are what you would expect from an all-star cast.  Taylor Kitsch is a rising star and this is an example of what he can do when given good material.  HBO veterans Ciaran Hinds, James Purefoy, and Polly Walker find themselves together again, after working together several years ago on the set of \\"Rome\\".  Dominic West and Mark Strong play the antagonists.  And the lovely Lynn Collins rounds out the cast as Princess Dejah.<br /><br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  And because it is a Disney movie, you can let your young children enjoy it with you.  See, you can make an action-packed, entertaining movie without making it unsuitable for children.  Highly recommended.

A mere five days after she leaves Christian Grey because she is convinced she cannot be the woman he needs, his submissive, Anastasia Steele takes him back into her life. He can't live without her and vows he will curb his need to control her, will demand none of what he first wanted her for. So, as Ana enjoys/endures the life of the obscenely rich with all its trappings, she learns a little more about her damaged man, and hopes she can be the one to heal him. But there are flies in the ointment: Mrs Robinson, hovering in the background; Leila, an ex-sub, who is stalking Ana; and Ana's new boss, Jack, who seems to want more than he has a right to. As with the first volume, this is painfully slow moving (half the book to cover 4 days), almost a reading endurance test, although if you skip the sex (gratuitous, clichéd, repetitive and not at all stimulating), it is a bit quicker read. There's actually a gun at one point to liven things up.....a possible helicopter crash, a visit to the psychiatrist, a loud confrontation with Mrs Robinson at the end and the hint of the threat that will probably take up the whole next volume: another 500 pages of Ana's subconscious and inner goddess (groan)...... I am not sure why these books are so popular: I have read better romance and erotica in Mills & Boon, but I think these books have been hyped up to tipping point.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This is a great app if you are trying to add toolbar shortcut to launch apps (not that I have tried many). This one just fits my requirements well. Configuring it took some time, but with a 2mb footprint I find it is a great utility.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I read this book while facing a medical crisis of my own. It was a great comfort to me. I read it quickly, with great interest.<br />My late husband had a similar experience while in a coma for 11 days, although he did say that he saw his predeceased grandfather and mother during that time. He laughed when he described how he \\"flew out of his body, right out of his feet.\\"  His fear of death lessened after that time.<br />I would recommend it for anyone interested in what happens after death, our souls, the hereafter. Coming from an author with a background in neurosurgery gives it the honesty and credibility that the subject has long been missing.<br />My only criticism would be that toward the end of the book I had some trouble following the author's thoughts. It seemed to get bogged down, and I would have appreciated a better editing and longer elaboration in that portion of the book.
B0041D843M|4.0|I thought this was a fascinating book. Although there are so much proof and information in it, it did leave me a little confused between these findings and the rational arguments that other people teach and espouse. Is it possible that Asian people have different genetics that make these statistics more reliable for them than for Caucasians? What about the whole blood type thing? I'm not quite sure what to think or which side of the fence to be on.
0792839749|5.0|After endlessly searching for this movie in the original form. I was advised to try amazon.com, which I did and glad of it because now not only do I love this movie but my four children love it as well. This movie plays and sounds great, just as I remember it.
B004SDEP38|1.0|not bad but yall could do better this truly is a AMAZON FALIURE &agrave;aaaalllllllllllsssssso always look at reviews before getting apps i mightbe there to comment<br /><br />  Yours Truly.......
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has once again done an outstanding job. This book  kept me wanting to read but yet, not wanting it to end. He certainly kept the ending hanging throughout the book. I highly recommend this book to the public.
B0091TGWYE|5.0|I ordered this up the same day I ordered my iPhone 5. I was a little skeptical because a similar case for my iPhone 4 a couple of years back really didn't fit well. I store my phone in my back pocket so this style of case is perfect to protect the phone from scratches and the occasional short drop ...<br />I was not disappointed this time. The case is good looking, practical and fits like a glove. It took a couple of days to \\"break in\\" the leather so the phone slips in and out easily but now it works great.<br />Other cases I have had with a \\"pull out the phone\\" tab have died pretty quickly but I am impressed by this one. It really has held up well over a couple of months of use so I am confident it will continue to do so.<br />Good purchase for me. I recommend it!
B00913DPW2|4.0|This game was beautiful and well developed, but don't plan on being able to play it without going back a forth between the game and walk through;  In fact, if you have access to a printer I suggest you print it out!  for about a week each night I sat down with a glass of wine while my husband watched his show and played for 40 min. so if you're looking for a game to keep you busy for hours or 40 min. at a time that is challenging you will enjoy!  Can't wait to try out the haunt 2!
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|I made the mistake of being on FB while TWD was on Sunday night. I do not have AMC so I buy it on Amazon on Mondays. Well, of course that sort of spoiled some of the big surprises in this episode...mainly the names of people who die, so I already knew that was coming, but the episode did not dissapoint. The actors pull out their \\"A game\\" in this episode and I was extremely moved by Andrew Lincoln's performance. Superb. I pray we are able to go at least a few more episodes without losing anyone, but I don't think we can be guaranteed anything at this point.
B008NABUU8|5.0|pretty addictive. different challenges with good graphics. I've tried a few others in passing, but this one holds my interest much longer.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I feel this was probably one of the best Scarpetta book in a while. I have read each one with relish, and this one paid off more than the last few. It seemed to start out and maintain  the same level of tension between the primary characters that I had begun to find rather tedious. I realize that in the real world relationships often don't resolve themselves the way we wish they would, but even so there can be some growth and resolution over time. This book finally showed some movement (I won't report which way that went - i.e. spoiler).  It was a well written story - as always - and in my opinion worth reading. Scarpetta remains one of my favorite female protagonists.
0316228532|2.0|The Harry Potter books are a stunningly well-written work of literature.  I am sad not to have enjoyed the next work by JK Rowling.  It's unfortunate that the cast of characters, though ably drawn, are so (almost without exception) unlikable.  There's just nothing to hold onto in this book, no one to root for, no moments of joy, and ultimately, no moments of real tragedy, unless the book has succeeded in its one transparent goal: to make you feel very very sorry for heroin addicts.  I have rarely read a book where the author's political beliefs got in the way of telling a good story quite so much.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|This book was amazing. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time! This book is a definite read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have never read a John Grisham book that I did not enjoy completely and can not wait for the next one.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Mr. Grisham can write an interesting story. However, the main character has no dimension and, instead of sympathizing with him, I found him a not very admireable person. Although the author continues to produce at least one or 2 books a year, nothing compares with his first book, \\"A Time To Kill\\".
B0045HCJG2|5.0|How could anything top Throw Mama From a Train?<br />Dude, this film blew me away.<br />This must be Stallone's finest work.<br />Gimme this over Rambo any day.<br />Must see film, even more so than Judge Dread.
B008X8QCTO|1.0|I paid money to get this dumb game and when I made it so far it wants me to pay more!? RIPOFF!!!!!!
B009JNXK88|5.0|one of the most satisfying retro games i have ever played. do you like mega man and super meat boy then you're gonna love this game I strongly recommend that you atleast give this game a try. I mean its even free right now so you wont lose a thing and if you like it only costs 99 cents. totally worth it.
B006G3JPWO|4.0|Very cool and a lot of fun. Good story line and interesting characters you care about.  I highly recommend it.
1451695195|5.0|Many people are expressing disappointment that Eben did not say more about his actual NDE, or what God said and what he learned. They wanted less of the medical jargon and background, and more of the core experience.<br /><br />He is not writing along the same lines as \\"Heaven is for Real\\" by Todd Burpo, or along the same lines as other books that are more directly spiritual or religious. His aim with this book is more towards opening the eyes of some of the skeptical people who would never even have given a subject like this a serious look.<br /><br />We have to remember that with Eben's background as a highly-educated and trained medical physician, he is trying to, at least in this first book (he's already writing another more in-depth book about his experience) reach the more skeptical audience: his colleagues and those who, if not for hearing about his case, would never even give NDEs a second glance.<br /><br />He's being careful to not jump in first with talking about how amazing and wondrous the experience itself was, after first not laying the foundation to assure those who are open, but still need a bit of background and reassurance, that what happened really did happen, and that he's not just making things up out of thin air.<br /><br />It takes a lot to convince minds like the peers of the doctor, and I think he, in this book at least, is trying not to lose them by running off into the spiritual aspects of it too quickly.<br /><br />Believe me, there are a lot of insights that Eben has talked about in numerous recent interviews. I'm sure that in following literature, he will expand on those. It's about pace. He has said himself that this is such a groundbreaking topic and one book will not do it. It is a long-term paradigm shift and he is just one of the people at the forefront of it: questioning our current cherished theories about how the brain and mind works.
143328880X|5.0|This audio book is very interesting, it is really a great story. I strongly recommend this audio book. loved it.
B008VVT51U|5.0|This movie is moving and at one moment so visually stunning that it takes one's breath away. Who ever was responsible for the crane taking flight and the event that it symbolizes was inspired. The film as a whole is beautifully created, acting superb and Maggie is one of a kind.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is fun enough to keep you entertained.  But my issues with it are that I have to add friends or pay to advance and the only representation of a person of color is a bush man. I don't  know about you,  but that comes off a little racist to me
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Full of danger, excitement, drama and love. This book is the best of the trilogy!  You will feel like you're in the movie!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is a page turner, I could not put it down!  This is John Grisham at his best, buy it, you won't regret it!
B00913DPW2|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Yes its difficult as others have noted but not impossible. Great graphics, seriously creepy, lots of fun.
030758836X|4.0|Gillian Flynn has set a new standard for suspense novels with Gone Girl. There were unexpected twists that undid all my assumptions throughout this riveting book. It is worthy of the accolades it has accrued and the writing is as brilliant as the plot.
030759565X|5.0|I love this cookbook for the same reason I love the blog: witty stories, vivid photos, trusted recipes, and amazing results. In the 4 days that my friend and I have had our cookbooks, we have made a combined 9 of Deb's amazing recipes - each has been as wonderful as I expected. These are the kinds of recipes that you will make for years, keep coming back to, hand off to your friends, and \\"always bring\\" for the holidays - not because you want to but because your relatives demand it of you.<br /><br />Some notable pros include:<br />-Measurements in weights!<br />-Delightful categorization<br />-Notes for \\"do ahead\\" (much like the blog)<br />-This, unlike the blog, can be given as a gift<br /><br />The one and only Con that I can muster is that I cannot pull the recipe up on my phone while at the supermarket to ensure that I have all the ingredients - this just means I will need to plan ahead!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I started out really caught up with this story but as I went on, I<br />became more skeptical. He got a little too \\"way out\\" for my taste.
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|I admit that I 'm a real big chicken. I was too horrified by some of the pictures on this game. Great graphics I'd say, but maybe TOO good graphics. Scared me so bad! Sadly I couldn't finish this game because of that. More horror than mystery /puzzles,  if you are okay for horror aspect on this type of games,  this is for you.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time. good time waster brids and pigs brids and pigs by by
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very amazing game. Minecraft works flawlessly on the kindle, and multiplayer is great. My only problem with the game is it is nowhere near the CPU version, and updates are slow to come out.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|great free game to play and pass the time. unlike most other apps its totaly free and you can actually play forever and not need to purchase anything.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|If you are a believer, no matter which pew you sit in, this is an uplifing book.<br />I'm still reading it but so far it has held my interest.  The Doctor makes a good case that he went somewhere else during  his coma.  The medical information is a little on the heavy side but if you read it with you PDR next to you, you can muddle through.  If this was a paper book, and not Kindle, I would place it in my archive to read every year.
B00008RH1H|5.0|English history is full of examples of thrones of blood but this one was more entertaining. Great movie to watch in place of political conventions.

B007NG93CK|5.0|Kathy Reichs does it again, god I love her stuff, she's funny and thoroughly entertaining. What would I do without Temp, Ryan, Katy, Pete, Birdie, Boyd, and all the rest :)
B0083P1QUM|5.0|In the true Patricia Cornwell style, this book keeps you riveted  and unable to put it down. I have always enjoyed her books, and this one did not fail me. The twists and turns keep you wondering throughtout the different stories within the front and back cover.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|I bought this movie specifically for the 3D effects. Very disappointing. I have several IMAX 3D blu ray discs at home and their 3D effects are just amazing. Most stores use them to showcase their 3D TV's. So, I use that as a standard when comparing 3D blu ray discs.<br /><br />Well, this movie falls way short of that standard. It appears to be a 2D movie converted to 3D, as opposed to being originally filmed in 3D. As a result, the 3D effects don't \\"pop\\" out of the screen as much. There's definitely no WOW factor. I enjoyed the movie, but was very disappointed with the 3D effects. If you like this movie, save your money and just buy the 2D version.<br /><br />Would have given it a better rating than 3 stars if it had better 3D.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I ORDERED AND PAID FOR: PROOF OF HEAVEN FOR MY KSINDLE.<br /><br />I DID NOT RECEIVE THE COPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote helps me organize my thoughts and projects.  Helps me stay on task.  It's helpful to be able to group so many different types of related objects into one container.
B009GEAPYW|1.0|I made a mistake though it was a new release. Instead it was a animated movie I don't have kids and I don't care for cartoons I never opened it I should have sent it back. But thato to late.
B004JMY312|5.0|This movie is the best. I came to Amazon to watch this movie. Apple iTunes had it but it did not download properly. Now I'm a diehard Amazon rental fan.<br /><br />Thanks so much!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Batman Begins was a great movie. I watched it recently again, because it had been awhile since I had seen it. Wanted to refresh myself for the newer Batman series in theaters.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this book as a lot of the story line took place in a area where I live and enjoyed reading Grisham's descriptions of the local places that I know.  Lots of twist and turns which kept me up all night to see out it ended!
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|After a year of not going near a John Green book, I find myself reading this wishing I had read it earlier. I didn't think any of his books could beat Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns but it has. Its just wonderful and it wasn't what I expected and that's what made it so great. You're missing out if you don't read this book. Its flawless
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The Hunger Games is the first book of The Hunger Games trilogy and it is a great introduction. Though the book is targeted towards young adults, regular adults will find it a great read as well. Think of it as a futuristic Lord of the Flies that takes place on reality television. It introduces the two main characters in a way that will make you care about whether they live or die. The problem arises when those are the only two characters that are really developed. Not all stories require character development, but when a story is about people's lives being on the line you want more development from all the characters.<br /><br />All in all it's a good introduction and the end will leave you wanting more, which is great because there are two followups. If you have time read it, you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />It's not groundbreaking, but it's enjoyable.<br /><br />Also if you liked the movie and you like reading, then you'll like the book.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this delightful movie.  As the title indicates it's about a very special hotel, in India for people in their \\"Golden Years\\".  The characters (All British retirees)  in this movie are all consummate actors who make you feel that you are watching a real-life drama unfold before you.  It's funny and touching and memorable.  If you like happy endings that involve new beginnings this is a movie for you.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander opens the door for science and spirituality to finally find a meeting place. If you are a skeptic, read this book with an open mind, and you will find solid, convincing evidence for life beyond the brain and consciousness outside the mechanistic view of reality that traditional science delivers. If you are not a skeptic, read this book and enjoy Alexander's heartful account of an amazing experience from a unique perspective.
1469984202|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.<br /><br />On the plus side:<br />- Although there are many things I disliked about the book, I did enjoy reading it; there were times where I couldn't put it down.<br />- I did feel that it was fast paced enough to hold my attention.<br /><br />On the minus side:<br />There is so much bad/incorrect science/technology in it that I cannot recommend to someone that cannot recognize these errors.<br />- diving as deep as stated in the book fast will kill you.<br />- a simple hose would not hold up for the depth of the dive described.<br />- surfacing/decompressing as fast as stated in the book will kill you.<br />- argon gas is inert and will not support combustion; you could not sustain a flame in a chamber flooded with it.<br />- radios with two simple antennas buried as deep underground as in the book would not be able to communicate.<br />- over a several hundred year time period, I doubt that modern technologies such as computers and high definition TV screens could be invented by isolated small populations.<br /><br />There are so many more holes in the technology that I am more likely to say that this is bad sci-fi
0140067477|2.0|Here's an idea: explain Eastern philosophy and how it can better your life in a way anyone can understand by relating it to Winnie the Pooh.<br /><br />Unfortunately the way it relates is as simple as the title would suggest.<br /><br />The concepts are all there, but the method of explanation isn't always clear. It's unfortunate, because it was a good idea. It just wasn't executed properly.<br /><br />Still, it's likely easier to read the Tao of Pooh than any regular Tao book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|These books always have a very interesting theme.  It is fun to read them and see how close to the title they stay.  ie. The Racteteer.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I find this enjoyable. This game reminds me of some of the games on Facebook, with the part where there is energy needed to do activities.
B008MEM24S|3.0|It was fun up until I got stuck on the one mission.  Without that one being completed I can't unlock the next mission and there is no help option.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I have read everything written by Patricia Cornwell.  I respect her writing and her background in providing authenticity to her work.  This book and her last feel like a buffet instead of a 3 course meal.  The twists and turns of the storytelling are just not there. Cornwell has always reminded me of Jeffrey Deaver's writing which pulls the reader into a chasm of thriller crime story telling that constantly surprises and challenges.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Pretty chill kinda slow though<br />You can breed different kinds of dragons then cross breed those dragons and so so much more.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Saw the movie first. Had a few questions so I read the book. There were so many things left out of the movie. Book was way better.
B000V6U80A|4.0|I'm pleased with this album overall.  I purchased this album for use in my massage therapy business and was disappointed that several of the songs have \\"jarring\\" moments.  I have to skip them which creates more work for me.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a great book. I usually take a few days to finish a book, but i read this in half a day!! Now i cant wait to see the movie.
B0053O89KG|5.0|This is one of most rewarding shows ever in terms of its pure entertainment value. The story lines are generally unique and even if sometimes predictable, the journey is still fun. The two main characters have fantastic chemistry and it includes a great supporting cast.  I particularly love the relationship development between Castle and Beckitt. It's been real, deliciously frustrating, and satisfying to watch grow. Overall, a good mix of crime drama, humor and romance, with none over dominating the other.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|love the game but hats when I ran out of coins I refuse to pay for the so I wait all in all it is mindless but addictive

B0026772N8|5.0|This is a great book to read.Whenever you want to take your mind off life's problems;it help to see things differently.We live in a world of so many problems,that we have to look to knowledge to give us new ideals to solve these complex experiences,and this book help to see life differenty.When i first heard of this book in the washington post,I didnt know what it's about until i started to read it.I was amaze of the author experience with issues in life and it gave me a totaly differnt way of looking at life.It put me on this knowledge quest to see things differntly,so now i constanly spend my time reseaching ideals and getting new perspective.
0792842723|5.0|My main issue with this film is that Q gave Bond a car (BMW) outfitted with many gadgets but Bond never actually uses it against any enemies. What was the point of having the car to begin with? Boris is hilarious. This is Brosnan's first Bond film. If you have watched the X-Men movies and think that Jean Grey is hot, you will want to watch this movie. The actress that plays Jean also plays the Russian villian named \\"Onatopp\\" in this movie. You actually get to see some cleavage. She also plays a character named \\"Rachel Wright\\" in the movie named \\"I Spy\\" where you get to see her in very skimpy underwear. Oh yeah!
B003VANOFY|4.0|The headset was purchased to replace the wired version that was accidentally broken by my dog running past my desk and ripping the cord, breaking the microphone.  Hence the purchase of the wireless version.  I have to say it is actually much more comfortable and lighter than the wired version.  The only issue I've found is if I don't talk on it regularly when in use, it will sometimes turn off (thinking I've stopped using it).  So, at times, I will chime in to talk to my fellow chat mates and after several minutes of non-response will realized they unit is off.

B000CNE092|5.0|This is definitely the complete package of what one excellent DVD , love this movie by Disney, perfect for all ages.
B003TXKSWK|1.0|Harsh lyrics for a harsh life portraying...not typical of upbeat Legend music. Wish I had selected a different album...good concepts and music abilities but not one I care to really listen to again and again.
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I am not usually a big \\"romance\\" or erotic book reader but had to check these out because of all the talk about them.  I am glad I did!  I love the story of Ana and Christian.  Yes there are great erotic scenes throughout the series but the heart of these books is a love story!  I loved the passion Christian has for Ana, his vulnerability to true love.  I loved Ana's innocence and her strong resolve to stay true to who she was.  They changed each other and were better for it.  Loved them!  Read them!
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I fiished all three books in less then a month. Whish there were more to read.

B008FSCNTK|2.0|I am disappointed in this album. It is a bit slower and not as catchy as her other incredible albums. I miss the jazzy, upbeat melodies and sultry voice of Krall's other albums. She has incredible vocals. The cover lends to a more sexy album than the music conveys...not scandalous music so don't let the cover deceive you. It is not one that I will play over and over.
B008E374PO|4.0|Adam Young has quite a talent and is loved for it. People who listen to any genre can easily fall in love with Owl City hits such as the child-like nostalgic \\"Hot Air Balloon\\" or the magnificent  \\"Alligator Sky.\\" For his albums \\"Ocean Eyes\\" and \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\" there was a magical and nonsensical feeling that brought the listener into a dreamy yet realistic mind visual. But the next album \\"The Midsummer Station\\" seems to have taken a slight twist into the regular. This album is overflowing with dance beats and modern auto tune that is very popular right now, not that Adam used auto tune before. His newly released songs have recognizable synths, beats, and rhythms. Turn on the radio and songs that are popular possess intertwining everything - from lyrics to voices to drum solos. But they are what's been hot for years and Owl City seems to know this and has followed in their footsteps.<br /><br />If you are as I and miss the whimsical feeling and mind visuals that sent you into a wonderful trance from his old albums, then I wouldn't recommend this album for buying. Listen to the samples and if there are aspects to certain songs you like, then consider them. But when I was otherwise occupied in additional activities of life and I turned back to this album I could not remember what the songs sounded like, they all ran together due to their similarity.<br /><br />If you like the modern dance tunes that are played at clubs and school dances, then this album is exactly what you are looking for. It is different enough from other music that you will most likely be refreshed by it. When dancing around my room this album put me in a wonderful mood and I could not sit still for the life of me (which was inconvenient for me at the time.)<br /><br />Over all, Adam Young knows how to obtain fans from different genres and is very talented. Old Owl City fans may be disappointed but if they give Owl City a chance for a new artist outlook they may find a smile on their face whilst listening, and new fans may be greatly ecstatic of this slightly different take on dance music. But one thing is very clear - this musician is no where near rock bottom.
B002RI9BI0|5.0|Touching and bitter, a useful insight to the side of war usually kept hushed up and out of sight. Well written and poignant

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have just fiished the Racketeer and enjoyed it very much.  Seemed<br />it started out slower than usual from John Grisham's book, but<br />maybe it was just me.  Anyway, it picked up real quick and kept me<br />guessing all through the book.  Lots of twists and turns of course,<br />and he delivered a great book as usual
B0092C2X7U|1.0|This game 'could' be fun, but the controls don't respond when you need them to and it makes you repeat the same level over, and over, and over. That's just no fun! although I do like watching the guy fall flat on his face, I would like the opportunity to advance to the next level when I know I'm hitting the button at the right time but nothing happens. It's just too frustrating! I installed this on two different tablets thinking maybe the first one was what was causing the problem. But after having the same issues with the non-responsive controls on the second tablet (even though the graphics looked 100% better)  I realised the only option I had left was to uninstall the app from both devices. I got this app while it was the faotd. I would NEVER think of paying for it. A total waste of money!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought this for a Nikon D3100.  I first used it to shoot a birthday party for a friend. It had ample power to bounce off the white ceiling.  All the shots were shadow free, brightly lit and with vivid color.  Close up or distance, no problem.  I'm happy I bought it.

B007R41E8O|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  The puzzles, the story, the graphics, and the length of the game.  The game was not too easy and not too difficult.  Easy to navigate, but challenging.  It has a journal to refer to and clues if you need them.  I loved it and wish I had another one just like it. Buy it.  You won't be sorry.

0316228532|5.0|I purposefully avoided most of the reviews written about JK Rowling's new novel, The Casual Vacancy, while I was reading the book myself. I wanted to experience the novel without any of the preconceptions of others. To a degree I was successful, and in retrospect I'm glad I made the effort.<br /><br />The author warned readers right from the start that this wasn't another Harry Potter. Unlike a large number of angry and disappointed readers I was vaguely aware of on my periphery, I took Rowling's advice to heart. As much as that wiggly little childlike voice inside me whined and moaned for more Hogwarts, I fed it some codeine tablets and a chocolate bar and laid it down to rest while the adult in me settled in a cosy armchair over a cup of coffee to read The Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />This is not a very nice book. Which is precisely why I absolutely adored it. That being said, I'm also quite happy to admit that if Rowling had not been the author, chances are very good I would not have picked it up. I am unashamedly a fan of JK Rowling's, the same as I am a fan of Neil Gaiman, Storm Constantine, Anne Rice or Poppy Z Brite, and will give everything they write a fair chance even if they're writing outside of their expected genres.<br /><br />But more about why I don't like nice books - they don't come across as being authentic. Real life doesn't have neat, convenient happy endings and, as much as it can be argued that reading is often a lot about pure escapism, I like knowing that there's always a chance that the character I'm rooting for will fail. So, it's down to personal preference.<br /><br />If you're looking for a rose-tinted happy ending, then DON'T read The Casual Vacancy. If you're looking for a story where the underdog is likeable, DON'T read this book. In fact, there are absolutely no likeable characters at all in this story. Yes, there are some I grudgingly kinda like, but no one for whom I'd willingly don a cheerleading outfit. I'm pretty sure that if Barry Fairbrother didn't die in the start of the book, some of his dirty secrets would have come tumbling out before long too.<br /><br />He's the real hero of this novel, and he bows out early, so we never get an accurate idea of what his true character is like. We end up viewing Barry through everyone else's somewhat rose-tinted glasses, and he is placed on a pedestal, as the only resident of Pagford who was able to dream up a bigger vision which expanded beyond the narrow-minded pettiness of the others. What Rowling says, at the end, is that the world needs more people like Barry Fairbrother, and though<br />I don't want to spoil, I'll suggest that in the end we do encounter someone who will step into the breach and fill his shoes. And it's not anyone you'd suspect, so shhh.<br /><br />I'll say this much, that I was pleasantly surprised to see this character grow beyond the societal pressures.<br /><br />As always, what I absolutely adore about Rowling's writing is her characterisation. Her prose might not be scintillating, but, much like Neil Gaiman, George RR Martin and Stephen King, she understands the rare art of storytelling, and of offering readers characters with whom they can identify - who hold up a sometimes dark mirror to our own reflections.<br /><br />We all know people like Howard, Samantha, Krystal, Kay, Gavin and Simon; people who are more often than not blind to their own faults. They lie to themselves as often as they lie to others, and act short-sightedly. They're human, like us, broken and sometimes bitter.<br /><br />If anything The Casual Vacancy is a cautionary tale, warning us to be more aware of our interconnectedness, and the web that glues society together. Despite the tragedy of the human condition, the novel also dares us to hope, and if there is ever to be any change in the world, it must first start with oneself.ry Fairbrother didn't die in the start of the book, some of his dirty secrets would have come tumbling out before long too.<br /><br />He's the real hero of this novel, and he bows out early, so we never get an accurate idea of what his true character is like.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green made a MASTERPIECE! I was completely captivated. At times, I wanted to put it away and never finish it. But this book is too good for that. It involves pain AND joy, and it's the best book I've ever read.<br />The Fault in Our Stars is about a teenage girl with terminal cancer. The tumors' progress has been stopped with an experimental drug, but that only gives her a little more time. This girl, Hazel Grace, meets a boy, Augustus Waters.<br />\\"Look, let me just say it: He was hot. A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at worst, a form of assault. But a hot boy...well.\\"<br />Augustus had cancer and now has a prosthetic leg. Augustus is perfect (okay, to me). He refuses to stop loving Hazel, even though the end is not too far away. This is more than the typical love story. There's a plot twist you won't ever see coming. The book was super sweet and super sad. I can't wait to reread it, though the first experience is the best. YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK!<br />P.S. Sorry, I've made it sound very depressing. But the book is definitely worth it and I'm sorry if I've done it injustice and made it seem too gloomy.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|`The Woman in Black' is pretty much a classic ghost story; lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is tasked with travelling to a small, tight-knit community to handle the estate of a wealthy woman who is now deceased. But while it's obvious his presence isn't welcomed, Kipps makes for the woman's isolated house and finds he has to deal with something a lot more sinister than paperwork, and in order to stop anymore innocent lives from being taken - and, perhaps, to save his remaining clean underwear - he needs to face a dark secret that the town is hiding.<br /><br />It maybe a familiar set-up, but `The Woman in Black' is still a well-shot, spooky ride. Director James Watkins pulls out old tricks to scare us, but it works brilliantly as he keeps the whole film in a slow, tense, unnerving atmosphere. The story is shrouded in mystery, as they always should be in these films, and Watkins strings us along by handing out little clues throughout and the scares come more from the build-up, which keeps you on edge, and it really helps on the delivery. Daniel Radcliffe also proves he can shrug off the-boy-who-lived and, although a little young for the role, puts in a generally solid and emotional performance as Arthur Kipps. If you let it take you along for the ride, `The Woman in Black' is worth the watch, every ninety-five creepy minutes of it.

B006P0FIGU|2.0|`The Three Musketeers' was suppose to be a fun, rip-roaring adventure about a young Musketeer wannabe joining up with the three titular heroes to thwart a plan to overthrow the inexperienced King of France, stop Europe from plunging into war, get the girl and, in general, save the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way, and even with top actors like Christoph Waltz, Ray Stevenson, Luke Evans, Orlando Bloom, and Milla Jovovich involved, `The Three Musketeers' is a really flat and forgettable affair, the kind of movie where you just can't seem to find anything to hold onto.<br /><br />The actors did their best, but the characters were just too cardboard to feel anything for, the humor was more miss than hit, and even then it was only chuckle funny than laugh out loud, and the action was too superficial and done-before to be engaging - I commented in an early scene that `Milla was going Resident Evil' and wasn't surprised to find Resident Evil series director Paul W.S. Anderson is at the helm - and the whole film just felt like it was chugging slowly along.<br /><br />It's a case of a lot of gloss and little substance, but a film is trouble when it struggles to even make the gloss work. If you are considering this, then rent or borrow it first before you commit to having it on your shelf, but you're not missing anything special if you give it a pass.

B009JNXK88|4.0|Short levels so you can play for a few minutes or play for a long time. Some easy levels some challenging levels, but a good balance. Very replayable, trying to collect all the briefcases. If you like platforming definitely a must try. If not it still is a pretty good game so you might still want to give it a try.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Good storyline.  Really kept me guessing to the end.  Was a recommended book and that person was right!!! I am definitely going to read another of her books.
B00003CX8N|5.0|My mom was born in 1920, so was of the same generation as the characters in this film. She also worked as a secretary, was always on the edge of poverty, and loved books.  So, naturally, she and her best friend absolutely loved the book this movie was made from.<br /><br />For me, watching it is like seeing a younger version of my mother. Even the love of writing letters, and the irony in them, are spot on for a generation of female self-taught intellectuals in a time when most women were still house-makers. (My mom wanted the university, but took secretarial classes instead because she needed to work. She finally took university creative writing classes in her 60s, after she retired.)<br /><br />The dignity and frustration of poverty, American style and British style, comes through, and the hardships in England during and just after the war are part of the backdrop. Also, it is a look back to the times when most people couldn't afford to travel overseas.<br /><br />This is a quiet, meandering film, and not for those who don't identify with the characters.  It's like a beautiful portrait of a past family member... Maybe if she isn't in your family, you won't find it so fascinating....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this show rocks. very violent and gory, but i highly recommend the other parts of it too for those that don't like voilence. suspence, drama, they've got you covered
B007N8RULO|4.0|this is a great game. i just hate all the ads in between games. I like how you can change the background and the cards. I wish the undo button was easier to get to.
B008XFAT7S|4.0|As a fun ride without much substance, the Raid is well worth watching. The fights are well choreographed and every hit seems visceral and meaty. If you are a fan of the genre (B13, Ong-Bak)there's plenty of fun to be had here.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I never finish games because I loose interest. Not this game...where is part two? I cant believe it was free!
B000VR824S|5.0|A great concert experience - top quality sound and vision from a wide range of musicians (stretching the boundary of \\"blues\\" nicely) - with lots of great performances (and don't miss the \\"bonus\\" little snippets of other non-main-stage guitarists).<br /><br />My favorite parts are the abundant amount of slide playing, and the fact that Clapton isn't an overly dominant part of it all, but that when he's on he's on.<br /><br />Lots of heart in this show. Highly recommended for fans of live, blues, guitar based quality music. Real music!
B004TI5N38|3.0|If you like Baldacci you'll enjoy the book.  It's a typical yarn well written and constructed.  I enjoyed it well enough.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Really didn't expect such an adult film and it sure is a more than questionable one for the little kids.  Every second is a gem in this film where in most films the gems are few and far between if at all.  The dialogue is flat out perfect as are the characters and voices.  I love the sound effects as well since they are so well defined.  Rango's encounter with the Spirit of the West is not only brilliantly funny but is philosophically deep as well which is not what you get out of kiddie movies.  Just watching 5 minutes of this is a feast and Johnny Depp's dialogue and nuances with his words is a treasure.  The only thing out of place was the Indian tracker crow when he got shot near the end since you don't want to see a character you like get it.  Other than that it's genius throughout though some pretty raw and gritty genius not for the faint hearted.  Probably has a least 50 dialogue gems in it which could be a record!
B008G33OJM|1.0|I'm just weighing in here to let you all know that I finally got mine and it doesn't work...<br /><br />I'm so disappointed since I love Tarja and Nightwish. The folks in quality control really screwed up this release big time!<br /><br />I always prefer Blu-Ray to standard DVD but I'm returning my Blu-Ray and ordering the DVD. I think that anyone experiencing this problem should be entitled to a Blu-Ray version once this problem is fixed at no extra cost!
B009NCM248|5.0|It's a concept album. It has different styles so don't look for any one certain persistent theme throughout the record. This is somewhat true, in my experience, of all Stone Sour albums, but especially so for this one.<br /><br />The bottom line is it's a great work of art. It very likely will alienate fans who expected another Audio Secrecy, which is a shame, because the creative process - what keeps a band alive - is stifled and ultimately killed by producing the exact same type of music over and over without reprieve.<br /><br />My only concern is that the first two tracks released for viewing/listening, Gone Sovereign / Absolute Zero, do not accurately represent the variety that the record as a whole represents, but that is more or less a poor publicity decision and does not take away from the value of the record itself. The rest of the album is good - but the decision to release two tracks that were very classic Stone Sour flavor as a preview to the rest of the very different, experimental album was somewhat misleading.

1451695195|4.0|I won't rehash the content of the book as that has been done in other reviews and elsewhere. Nor am I particularly concerned with the style of the book, how well it is put together, and so on. Rather, I want to focus on issues of how convincing is this \\"proof of heaven.\\"<br /><br />(Note: I am a pediatrician so have some background in infectious diseases and neurology, but those are not my areas of expertise.)<br /><br />I see no reason to dismiss the account out of hand, whether as a fabrication or hallucination. Assuming that the publishers have done basic fact checking (that the author is who he claims to be, that he experienced such an illness, etc.), Dr. Alexander is a competent, rational, educated person with no obvious reason to make up the story. He is also an expert on many aspects of brain function. Still, as with any first-person narrative, it would make sense to investigate further, checking with other witnesses and any documents including medical records. One important factual question would be when Dr. Alexander first spoke to another person about his NDE.<br /><br />I am open to the possibility that the experience reflects reality (a world \\"above\\"), and even hope that it does. I do have some concerns, which I mention not to discredit it, but to point out areas which should make us cautious about leaping to the conclusion that it is in fact a \\"Proof of Heaven.\\"<br /><br />First and most important is the question of when the experience occurred. The author simply assumes throughout the book that it happened during the coma, but what evidence is there for that? Assuming that it did happen during the coma, how could he know that since he was not aware of the external world and able to correlate the timing of the NDE with outside events? It seems that, from a this-worldly point of view, he would not have been able to remember or reconstruct the experience until he had recovered from the coma; by then, how could he know that it occurred while he was comatose rather than in an in-between state?<br /><br />Consider this possibility: the patient is indeed deeply comatose, with no higher brain functions. At some point, the brain recovers enough to regain consciousness, but is still in a dysfunctional state whether from drugs, ICU psychosis, sensory deprivation, or whatever. Alexander himself points out that after a brief period of lucidity, he was \\"crazy.\\" The NDE could have occurred during the early awakening or later, stormy period, and have been retrojected into the past. The author mentions something like this as the \\"reboot \\" hypothesis, only to discount it with, \\"But this seems most unlikely given the intricacies and interactivity of my elaborate recollections.\\" I agree that it seems hard to imagine a sick, rebooting brain creating such detail and meaning from scratch, but I'm not sure it is less plausible than the alternative that the experience was real.<br /><br />The second question is whether Dr. Alexander's brain was truly incapable of creating the NDE. He emphasizes repeatedly that his neocortex was non-functional. It was \\"out of the picture,\\" \\"inoperative,\\" \\"down,\\" essentially \\"absent,\\" \\"damaged,\\" \\"off,\\" and even \\"devoured\\" by the bacteria (this last not being an accurate description scientifically). Perhaps so, but I would like to hear more evidence. Alexander is a neurosurgeon, so should have a very good idea of how clinical states correlate with brain activity, but he does not go into detail. Given the depth of the coma and the consideration of whether he was beyond recovery, were not brain-function studies done? Was the cortex metabolizing glucose, being perfused by blood, electrically active at all? These are basic questions and could be simply answered if the tests were performed.<br /><br />It seems intuitive that the brain cannot produce such a conscious experience unless the neocortex is functioning at least somewhat normally, but how well is this established? I am not at all familiar with the NDE literature, so the answer may already be known, but it would be good to have it spelled out. Since the book is meant for a popular audience, the absence of such detail is quite understandable, but that doesn't mean it can be ignored.<br /><br />Another question is how Alexander's NDE compares with reports by users of hallucinogens. Are there enough dissimilarities to let us be reasonably sure that drugs or the \\"DMT dump\\" or \\"endogenous glutamate blockade\\" hypotheses he mentions were not responsible? The author believes those could not have caused his experience because his cortex was zapped, but if that issue is put aside, could those mind-bending factors have accounted for the nature of his NDE?<br /><br />Finally, a tiny red flag popped into my head when Alexander presented a particular, patented method of meditation as a way to achieve something like his NDE: \\"I believe Hemi-Sync has enabled me to return to a realm similar to that which I visited deep in coma, but without having to be deathly ill\\" (Kindle location 2039). This is probably nothing but a sincere endorsement, but it did cause me to wonder.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />In the end, I can only say that the account is very interesting but that I am not competent to judge the evidence. What I would like to see, and what I hope does appear, is reviews by a few neurologists, neurosurgeons, and other neuroscientists who can confirm or question the author's assertions and conclusions. It should be a very good discussion!iterature, so the answer may already be known, but it would be good to have it spelled out.

B0000062GK|3.0|First half of the album reminded me of other albums I've listen to with familiar guitar licks and sounds. The other half was a little more refreshing in some of the tunes that Satriani came up with. With that said as a consumer, coming up with innovative and creative music is definitely not easy so I can appreciate the work and effort in producing any form of music that is original and fresh. I love great music that Rocks and there are a couple of tunes here that did just that. I enjoy listening to it. Got it second hand from an Amazon online vendor in \\"very good condition\\". Had more scratches on it than anticipated but hasn't affected sound quality. Got it for a great price, so no complaints! I liked the album overall.

It tells the story of a couple living in Africa who come across three orphan lion cubs and keep one female, whom they name Elsa. Later they are pressured to give Elsa up to a zoo, but the woman can't because, as she argues, Elsa was born free and should therefore live free. She'd never be happy in a zoo.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Elsa has become too tame as a result of living with the couple. Can Elsa ever adapt to the wild or will she be condemned to a cage in a zoo?<br /><br />The footage of Elsa with the couple is amazing. She's like their pet cat! I'd love to have a lioness pet to hug and pat and walk around the yard with!<br /><br />Shot in beautiful Kenya, the film runs 95 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: B+
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put the Kindle down, my husband was getting jealous.  I loved this book the twist and turns keep me wanting more.  I can't wait to start on the next one.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Disclaimer from me:  There is only one way to Heaven and that is God's Son, Jesus.  It is with that in mind I offer this criticism: I don't completely trust this account as he could have been fooled by Evil Forces, there is only one name given where under man can be saved, the man:  Christ Jesus. So weigh this in your own mind.  I find that extremely troubling that Jesus is basically omitted in this account.  However, I did enjoy the book.<br /><br />Written by a distinguished brain surgeon, this book and the details of his own near death experience, carry more weight with me as he explains the physiology of the brain and what is and is not possible, according to scientific logic.  It is his personal experience and he explains what happened to him very well, at least as good as you can using mere words.  Many things he experienced were outside his ability to fully do justice in describing the experience.  Yet, he saw things he shouldn't have been able to with remarkable clarity, given the fact that his brain was totally flat-lined, as he tells later after examining the data.  This indicates that there is a spiritual essence to people that science does not and cannot acknowledge or understand.  Many people already know this, but it is validating to have a good first person account from a highly trained and skilled scientific medical mind given from their own experience.  I found it to be uplifting, powerful and a great read.  I would treat it as fiction however.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|We did not love this movie, and would have been happier to watch it if we had not paid to rent it.  Save this one for when it is on TV.
B008NABUU8|1.0|Program super slow and crashes.  Loads OK until you try to play it, then ends up locked up and crashing.  Samsung SGH-I997
B005KAH7QU|1.0|We rented this on a whim and regretted it.  If you are the type who likes artsy films that take themselves too seriously then maybe you will like this, but we wish we could have the time back in our lives.
B00846REIS|3.0|Book is good but at times similar to 50 Shades of Grey.  I do like the two main characters Eva and Gideon.  I felt Eva was more real life with her trouble childhood.  She is a lot more experienced and no so naive.  Gideon is just as closed off as Christian Grey.  Although rich men might be like this.  I wouldn't know.  At times I felt myself saying really, when the author bring up dom/sub relationship.  I almost felt this could have been left out.  All in all.  I wanted to read the next book in the series.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This book definitely has some slow parts, but all-in-all it left me wanting more, as it picks up as the book moves along.  If you are a book editor, however, or have the mindset of an editor, you will cringe.  He always opts for taking five paragraphs to say what could be said better in five words.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Did not like it, author promoted himself too much in my opinion, he did not shine enough light on his subject matter..
B0054IOWTS|3.0|The pictures of the cave are amazing, but I am not sure that I would recommend that anyone pay to rent this.
1619695006|1.0|This book started slow, and I had hoped it would pick up. It never did. the book dredged on, with a boring english voice narrative, focused on character development- only all of the characters are extremely depressed, filled with anger, some suicidal. This book depressed me! It was a struggle to get through- just a meandering tale about the lives of these horrible people in a small english town. would not recommened- but would LOVE to sell my copy to someone else- for cheap!
B0083GPDBO|3.0|I would not recommend this movie, but it wasn't a complete waste of money, as it was an interesting concept at least.  If you see it on TV, tape it, but I would not pay to rent it.
0062202081|5.0|This transaction went well.  The book was a gift for my niece and she really enjoyed it.  The book arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition.  I will definitly do business with them in the future.
B0071MV540|4.0|I was dead set against renting this, but my husband really wanted to see it so I finally agreed.  I was pleasantly surprised, as it was not as corny as I was worried it would be.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The movie was better than I expected, I've watched it at least 10 times since I received it in the mail.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Not the best book in the series, and not the worst.  It feels like an interminable bridge between the first and third.  Someone really should have had the guts to edit his books.  The series would have made for a nice tight trilogy.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I bought this as a Kindle book.  And as such didn't get a jacket to review to get clues about the book.  I have all (or at least most of John's books) and use the jackets to get some idea of what to expect.<br />This novel started out fine, but at first Ididn't see the connectionto the title.  As we meandered about it started to become clear.  It just took longer than what you normally would expect from a John Grisham novel.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|My husband likes the series, so we rented this.  It was fine - typical mission impossible - so if you like the movies in general you will like this one.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|It's now season 5 of the ad men and women of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. We're now in the mid-60's and the world continues to change. Our heroes have to go with the times and creative advertising for a changing world. Although I love the show, MADMEN seems to be slowing down. It seems like only troubled, narcisstic and egotistic men can find work in advertising along with one lady and a sexy female office manager. Few of these characters are likeable and all have morality issues yet we seem to like them. John Hamm continues to be a winner as the trouble Don Draper. Draper has long been on top of his game but now he is facing middle age and a new generation of consumers. After a surprise marriage to his secretary Megan, he now has the chance for love and happiness and domestic stability. He has it all but still has to fight his inner demonds.<br />Lovely Jessica Paré brings warmth and fresh air to the series and Megan Draper. Maybe this marriage will work if Don gives it a chance. Former wife Betty is also remarried and know struggles with a weight problem and a disagreeable daughter.<br />Christina Hendricks is as gorgeous and vuluptuous as ever as Joan Harris. She's another troubled soul who runs hot and cold and has a love/hate relationship with men.<br />It is fun to take a step back in time to see characters dressed in mid-60's styles dealing with issues of the day. I am amazed that the show is able to use real products. Ad campaigns center around well-known products of the day and many are still in existence. The fight for the JAGUAR contract while admitting JAGUARS are beautiful and sexy cars that are mechanical nightmares. How do they get away with that?<br />Our season doesn't even end with any cliffhanger...more of just a \\"what next?\\" attitude. I still like the show but it seems to need an infusion of energy and drama.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I liked this book more than the first two in the series, as it has far more action and things really move at a good pace.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Though his writing remains beautiful, this plot did not hold one's attention as the previous books did.  I hope this is a failure of this one book and not a trend as I was left, as usual, hanging off a cliff.  Have to find out the fate of Jon, Brienne, Jaime and Cersei. Everyone keeps dying!
B00846TTDG|5.0|Not sure what we expected, but we really liked this movie.  We had not heard of it before, but were very glad we took the chance and rented it.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Lots of special effects. Nice fantasy movie. Stars casted do well in their fictional<br />characters. Very creative in taking a childs nursery story into a movie.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I had heard mixed reviews of the book in particular, but we ended up liking the movie a lot.  We would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction/fantasy, which tend to be our preferred genres.
B009FOBZL0|5.0|This CD contains a solid collection of intelligent tunes.  The band plays music that is energetic, without being the standard computerized nonsense that is playing on your typical juvinile radio stations.  Good tunes for a more sophisticated audience, but an audience that still enjoys capturing that youthful passion.
B006MQRLSA|3.0|It is a cute story, and we enjoyed watching it.  Not the best movie ever, but worthy of seeing nonetheless.
1936608898|5.0|This book has a lot of great information with science to back up their views. Must read for those who are interested in how food affects the body.
B008CP93S0|3.0|We wanted to like this movie, but it just strays a little too far off the reservation at points.  Not something I would recommend that anyone pay to see.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book was compelling and held my interest.  Obviously a departure from Rowling's Harry Potter series but no less entertaining.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in human weakness.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I love this group.  I have not had any other CD's by this group.  Moves like Jagger is on this CD and it is an awesome song.  The other songs on this CD are great as well.  I used this CD as an exercise CD while on my treadmill.  Get great cardiac from these songs - makes you want to dance while on the treadmill and I do.
B0092C2X7U|2.0|first you need to master the backflip then you need to master the nearly impossible location! way too hard at least add more lives otherwise its nearly impossible to beat.
1609613937|5.0|I have been consuming books of this ilk for the past year or so and applying what I have learned in pursuit of better health for myself and my loved ones who may listen to what I have learned.<br /><br />The Starch Solution provides academic support for eating a purely plant-based diet for good health as well as weight loss. Dr. Mc Dougall is one of the contemporary pioneers in this field. The book is easily read, well documented, contains some inspirational testimonials for those needing \\"case study\\" verification and many recipes to help readers get under way with a healthier eating style.<br /><br />I would recommend the book, and the lifestyle it teaches, to anyone wanting to avoid interventionist medicine such as heart surgeries, gastric bypass surgeries, diabetes and a plethora of other ailments that are a product of our typical American diet.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its alright. its has a good concept. I play it. I wouldn't recomknd it. but I think haveing to buy the games is retardd
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I long to find those books where you can't figure out what's going on until the writer tells you. Some are so predictable that you can already tell what's going to happen along the way and even how it will end. Couch wrote this so well, telling the story in such a way that there were too many possibilities for what could be going on for you to figure it out. The story pulls you in right away (literally from page one) and keeps you guessing the whole time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Sooo much fun!!!!! I'm so addicted to this game! Its a lot of fun I could play coin dozer ALL day!!!! :D
B008NABUU8|5.0|Finally i've found a game that challenges me, not some boring game where all you do is build stuff and collect coins to build more stuff...
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I still work and am very active in my church.  This product allows me to review materials and respond promptly.  I am thankful for this Kindle Fire App!
B0091REZMW|5.0|great graphics and nice tutorial.  I cant believe this game is free. great for kids too now I have to think of mire words for the minimum
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am finding this quite easy to use. When I am in a hurry it gets the job done without having to fidget.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyable book, good plot.  Parts of it did remind me somewhat of one of his previous books - The Partner.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Mahjong Deluxe HD is a good game, I enjoy playing it and it does keep my interest!  I would suggest this to anyone who likes to play Mahjong.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've read all of his books and can't wait for him to write new ones!  The Racketeer did not let me down either.  Keep 'em coming John!! I could not put the book down and the book's ending was awesome!!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|fantastic book!!! Couldn't put it down from start to finish. Can't wait for next book to come out in may x
B007N85ZXY|2.0|Neil Young is probably one of my favourite artists of all time, despite duds like Old Ways, Reactor and his Shocking Pinks album. Unfortunately, this offering is among those that I binned after a few listens. There is only one strong track here. Wayfaring Stranger is a complete gem - what a pity it keeps such forgettable company here.
0071373586|5.0|This book is very helpful to anyone who works in marketing or management. The author offers practical, relevant information in the areas of product management, branding, and marketing.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|A nail biting story that gets you from the first page. A really good read. Nelson DeMille is always consistent.

0060833459|5.0|This is a great book that focuses on five essentials to business effectiveness: time management, choosing what to contribute to an organization, knowing where and how to mobilize strength for the best effect, setting the right priorities, and effective decision making.

B0063GORYU|5.0|this app makes you think but is relaxing at the same time. I play a few rounds every night before bed. it clears my mind to focus on just this game.
B0031TZASY|4.0|Great book. Such a fantastic imagination. The human condition truly examined. An intelligent child placed in great danger by circumstance. Prepared for what lie ahead by wonderful parents, great faith and lessons already learned in life. It was a fantastical tale of fear, suffering and triumph. A very good read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I just love John Grisham and I have read almost everything he has written.It is about a lawyer (big surprise there) and he is placed in a precarious position & must use his legal skills to get out of it.<br /><br />I would buy it again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is a nail biter with many unexpected and shocking events. I think that this season is the best yet. Can't wait for each episode to air.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is just like all of Grisham's novels- thrilling and engaging. Once again he was able to approach the story in a new way.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fast moving with many different turns making one eager to turn the next page.  The plot made the reader try to anticipate the direction of the story was taking.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Just like it was when I saw in the theater in 3D. Plus the bonus feature are the best. this is easily one of my favorite movies.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I Could not put it down!!! I have read all of Grisham's books and I would rate this in the top five.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|I love everything about this film. It is so cool to be able to watch the Director's Cut of this movie on Blu Ray! This movie racked up at the Oscars in 1984. That is the year i was born! So to see a film from the 80's look so good in high def just astonishes! Also this movie is full of wonderful music which sounds awesome with the high def dolby transfer! Must see!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Need to have a new one.  I have played this one over and over. Come out with a newer one soon.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Scorsese and Dicaprio have a chemistry together that shines through in this strange and sometimes spooky thriller. Great acting by the cast. Mark Ruffalo gave an excellent performance as well. The style and feel of this film is imaculate.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I thought this book was pretty unremarkable. It was not up to the author's usual standards. I was sorely disappointed.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|All time classic.  One of the most terrifying movies I've ever seen.  Truly depicts the adventure and terror of living under these conditions.  Music is very moving, one of my all-time favorites.
B0013O123Q|2.0|A brutal depiction of violent rape and a discombobulated story.  Hard to follow.  I found it difficult to sympathize with any of the characters in this movie.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|a good waste of precious time. i enjoyed it; got a little boring towards the end tho and wassup with the coming soon tab? (:
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The story is great and the characters too. It can be a little gory but it's so far from reality it's kind of like watching Jurassic Park- who's really afraid of dinosaurs? I avoid serial killer stuff- too real, but this is just scary fun! Good one to watch with friends and a big bowl of popcorn!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This novel grabbed my interest in first few sentences. Most novels take a chapter or 2 to hook me. I was unable to put the Kindle down and finished it within 24 hours. A top novel for Grisham.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Thought this was one of the best from Grisham in a long time.  Very inventive and enjoyable beginning to end.
B008NABUU8|1.0|The game looks pretty fun to play, but I haven't gotten past the third level because it would often freeze and not accept any input.  I have to hit the home button to exit the app.  I'm running on a Samsung Galaxy S
B000U6BT40|5.0|What I particularly like about this show is that the people and the events are believable, even though they are clearly outside of reality as we know it.  It is futuristic and yet very much in the present.  The most virtuous aspect of this series is that I can be sure to be spared foul language, unnecessary sex, and brutal violence.  The viewer always knows that the contentious situation will be resolved, that humor will be laced throughout, and that romance and intrigue will be handled gracefully.  Thank you to the writers for an enjoyable fantasy!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It the usual great John Grisham. It flows , wanting you to  turn every page and never lay it down until you are finished. It is a differ3nt from his usual subject development.  Very good.
B001ILFUNW|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It's funny,heart warming,and great to watch with a member of the opposite sex. I would have prefered it in the full screen version but you can't have everything.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is an okay game it uses up your time that you just don't know what to do with it.
B009C5Z112|5.0|This album has been in the making for years and it is well worth the wait. The songs are a beautiful crafted blend of metal and symphony.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought the ending was the best. I enjoyed it the most out of all the books. A must read. I am so sad its over. I need to find a new book.
159420411X|5.0|A well written book with case studies across many areas of prediction.  While not shying away from some of the math, the book is still accessible and entertaining to general readers as well as we that make our living trying to make solid predictions about future events.  He includes many hints and best practices which will help to raise our collective predictive capabilities.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying this book.  It will certainly give you insights on why his methods produced such an accurate predictions of the 2012 elections.  It's not magic, rather a road map to the future.
B007W7P5L8|3.0|This product is a lot like the hard cell phone protector I bought and it works. The stand has to be on a level surface to work. It could use a deeper slot to slip the stand into.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|The voice is the same, however I was disappointed on the selection of songs. I have come to expect more from Diana Krall.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am so thankful that people with these experiences are willing to share.  I am a firm believer of heaven and life after death.  I have had experiences that has been so powerful that there is no doubt in my mind.  I appreciate someone who was a skeptic to dare and confess his belief in heaven.<br />[[ASIN:B008AK8FHM Proof of Heaven]]
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of his best novels in years.  Intriguing twists and turns.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  At midpoint it becomes increasingly hard to out down.
B009P13RQY|4.0|For this album, the Sword keeps doing what they do best, with some minor tweaks to the formula that improve both the songs and the listening experience.  These guys know their 70s hard rock history, recalling at times Judas Priest, Thin Lizzy (and Allman Bros.), Sabbath, etc, while still maintaing some of that 90s era stoner vibe.  The new drummer's got a bit of swing, which I personally like better than the previous guys' horse gallop.<br /><br />Overall, one of the best hard rock albums to come out this year. The xtra live tracks are OK...the ZZtop cover reminds me of the one Mastodon did for record store day.  Actually, I had a chance to score the vinyl at Amoeba, and would recommend that over other formats.  The analog synth parts sound much richer on record for some reason, and the break between the hidden masters and dying earth is very well done.
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|A pesar de conocer muy bien estos discos, fue sorprendente las grabaciones de los conciertos en vivo con arreglos especiales.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|The book keeps you guessing and contains a delightful description of each step of the investigation.  Great book for the light fictional mystery buff.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|I can just keep listening to this CD over and over again.  Each and every song is a winner.  I'm sure you'll enjoy it too.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved the twist and turns.  Best part, the disclaimer at the end.  It really ties it all together. Thank you Mr. Grisham!!
B006R1T40I|5.0|It may sound crazy, but I put this CD on and listened to it over and over again.  A few of the songs got me on my feet and made me dance around the house.  Bonnie is so soulful and a fabulous musician.
0525952616|5.0|I had read his previous two books and was really looking forward to this one. And I was not disapointed. I hope he continues to crank them out. The combination of fast paced action and facinating technology gets combined with astute social insights.
B008XCJ03K|4.0|i hate is an especially clever and catchy song, and generally all of the songs are nice new/anti-folky songs with an interesting and charismatic voice. for the price (about $5), a great deal.
B000IZXR7U|5.0|The movie is so simple and economical in expression that it just never gets old.  It's in no way sophisticated, but doesn't matter.  The whole thing is just like taking a hatchet to wood, simply effective -- no more, no less.  You gotta appreciate that.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book has well developed characters, an interesting plot and world.  Many twists and turns in the plot.  At one point I actually gasped out loud! I was caught up immediately and throughly enjoyed the read.  When I finished, I was not at all happy to find out that I have to wait for the second book to come out.  I will certainly re-read this book before reading the second book, when it comes out.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|Which one is the best James Bond, right?  I can't pick one, because each one of them actually pretty well reflect the particular times, and for that, I can even forgive and enjoy Roger Moore.  Of course, the least appreciated today probably is Timothy Dalton, which is not really fair in my opinion, especially considering he had the best &#34;gun barrel&#34; sequence (I'm talking about the shooting stance).  And Sean Connery, no matter how you look at it, had the worst.  Anyway, Daniel Craig is a very good Bond -- mean, ugly, ruthless, remorseless, even slightly humorless, too -- a bit like what you would imagine 007 would look like if you read the novels instead of watch movies first.  Hence, he makes pretty good Bond movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read most of Grisham's books and this is by far the<br />best read yet.  All of the twists and turns makes for<br />a great ending and entertaining all the way thru.<br />Highly recommend.
B001JI72AI|4.0|It tickles good fancy, and it's not a bad movie at all.  However, even though it may be based on the true story, by no means it's quoted for a historical accuracy.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The Litigators - a very enjoyable read with the expected surprise or unanticipated ending.  I stayed reading it well beyond bedtime.<br /><br />Dean Quayle
B004NEY9EW|4.0|Daniel Craig as James Bond, there's not really a whole lot that you get to dislike.  I really don't know about the title though, &#34;Quantum of Solace&#34; sounds really just rather, er, stupid.  Fortunately, the movie isn't.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|As I re-read these books I'm overwhelmed.  The fluid style of writing never fails him.  I start reading and can't stop.  My imagination takes over.  I know these people.  By the end of the book, they are my friends too.  And enemies.  I honestly can't get enough of his books.  I'm so glad to be able to read them on my kindle fire HD.
B009GENZ12|5.0|this movie is not bad at all only thing is it should have beed 30 mins longer than it was
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After coming off a Hunger Games high a few months ago, I was looking for another series that I could get into. I was hooked from the very first chapter of the first book. It's amazing how Howey was able to create such an intricate plot, one \\"mini\\" book at a time. It felt very much like a TV series with cliff hangers at the end of each book. I can't wait for book seven!
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a very fun and addicting game. I would have given it 5 stars but I gave it 4 because I don't like the way it didn't explain what some of the things can do. You either have to  figure it out by trial and error or ask someone. Other than that is game is extremely addicting!
B0083GRZ10|5.0|I have never watched an episode of Bones that would be given a negative rating. I am tickled to watch the evolution that has taken place in this television series. Having been a long-time fan of Kathy Reich's novels, years before her work was targeted for \\"Bones\\", it is easy to see how the adaption for television has not detracted from Ms. Reich's good work.<br /><br />5 Stars and 2 Thumbs up.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very well written from a black man's perspective. I have to wonder if the author had help with the perspective part too.
B0035LJZ1Q|4.0|Sleepy Hollow, a creative twist on an old classic.  It had moments where it could have been better, hence the four star rating, but overall it was enjoyable.
B008OOYALE|5.0|wroks awsome fun to play i love the little dragons and all the colors i love my dragons and breeding  them to make new ones
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very suspenseful! Excellent! Once I started I couldn't' put it down until I finished reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|The movie had tons of potential but it just seem like they could not get it to mesh right which would be hard I suppose for goodness sake its abe. So while the action is there and the actors did a great job. The story just was not strongly written to even make it a C- movie. But like I said it had potential...............
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Excellent story line - good acting - effects not overwhelming yet phenomenal - good pace ... definitely in top 20 of this genre... and definitely Promethean mythological construct gives it an element of occult surrealism...  which by the end is blended in with the current SF Hollywood mystique - I guess they couldn't resist - it works but slightly awkward undermining  original validity of a separate universe... guess $$$ hard to ignore and one must promote the future....  For some it completes a puzzle... and may be a peak revelation... for me, it was a little awkward, but I am a little bit of a purist. I still say, it is a great film overall.  Definitely would love to see a future sequel.
B009LZHRCO|5.0|This is the best way of watching this awesome show. I buy the episodes in HD for $2.99 and it picture quality is great. I have a cable connection, but even when the bandwidth (connection speed) is a little low the picture is still good. For those who like musicals and for those (like me) who don't...this is an amazing show. Mostly pop songs with great drama.....a must watch!
B005LAIHZE|4.0|Anyone who goes into this film looking for logic, deep drama or lofty scriptwriting needs to go somewhere else.  For what this film is... a hybrid action/horror/fantasy/thriller flick with an absurd (but humorous and ingenious) historical twist... it's a fun ride.  If you think comic book/graphic novel, then you're thinking along the right lines, and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />To the people who feel the need to argue about how silly it is to have Lincoln jumping on horses, or vampires as Confederates etc, I ask, what were you expecting from a film with this title?  Realism?  Character development?  Logic?  It's no more ludicrous than Star Wars, E.T., Twilight, Lord of the Rings, etc.  So just sit back and enjoy this take on the subject.<br /><br />And a final note... vampires have been done a million times, will be done a million times more, and the lore changes from film to film.  Some people get upset here that vampires can walk in the sunlight, or not kill other vampires, etc... and that's just nonsense.  There's no written commandments for what a vampire can/can't do, everyone's take is different.  And thankfully so.  Can you imagine every vampire film you've ever seen as having the exact same vampire lore?  It would have become tedious years ago.  This film maybe be silly and really far-fetched, but it does it's thing and it does it well.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Top notch Grisham. Could not put it down, up to 2AM. Great story, twists and turns, keep you guesting to the very end. One of Grisham's better stories. Worth rereading.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I am posting because I was looking for a comparative review between the Astro A50s and the Turtle Beach Tango before I went out and bought one and I couldn't find one. I saw gamers here waiting for a similar review so I decided to do one. This isn't a professional comprehensive review this is just my take and how I ended up with one over the other. I am not saying which you should buy I am just noting my opinion.  IF you have either one of these headsets then you have a great headset and you will be very happy. For me there were some things that stood out over the other and because of that I was able to make my decision and I feel I made the right choice!<br /><br />So I picked up both the Astro A50s and the Turtle Beach Tangos to test out. I used each one for about two days on various games and tried all the features to help me decide which of these 300 dollar headsets I wanted to keep.<br /><br />In the end I felt the Tango's are well ahead of the Astro A50s in terms of awesome features like software to create user custom EQ presets for audio or chat, surround angles, removable microphone and Bluetooth, which makes it compatible any Bluetooth device like a real headset. The sound quality on both the A50s and Tango are great so any edge the A50s may have isn't enough to lose out on all the features the Tango's give you. Honestly even if the Astro A50 were $100 cheaper I would still opt for the Tango's. The Astros just don't have enough features, and with no Bluetooth you have to use them with the transmitter only. The Tango's have incredible features and since I can use them with my Vita, smartphone and tablet I feel has more use and therefore a better value.<br /><br />I am not a fanboy I have wanted the Astros for a long time, when the A50s came out I decided to make the plunge, I was a bit disappointed which lead me to try the Tangos.  Between the two the Tango's are it. Turtle Beach really made an awesome headset that is packed full of gaming features and is comfortable and stylish. The Astro A50s are bare bones compared to the Tango and the lack of features and comfort does not make up for the slight sound difference.<br />So on to it!<br /><br />Setup: Verdict: Tango<br /><br />Astro A50: It wouldn't power on via the PS3 Slim USB port. I had to go online and install a firmware for both the headset and the transmitter. Once I did that it worked somewhat. Every time I would power off the PS3 and power it on again the transmitter would not come on - I have to keep switching USB ports to get it to turn on. Not what I want to do for a 300 dollar set of headphones. Also you have to turn on both the headset and transmitter manually. No charge and play cable so I had to wait for it to charge before I could use it (I didn't have a long USB)<br /><br />Turtle Beach Tango: No issues. When you turn on the headset the transmitter turns on automatically - small but great feature. The Tango's also came with a long charge and play cable.<br /><br />Sound : Verdict: Astro A 50 (but only by a slight edge)<br /><br />Astro A50:<br />Very nice, warm deep rich sound. I wouldn't say I was blown away but they were nice. They have a bit more bass and volume then the Tangos.<br /><br />Turtle beach Tango:<br />As with the Astro I wasn't blown away but again these sound great. The Tangos produce a different sound from the A50s, they aren't as warm but they do seem to have great clarity and still sound very awesome.<br /><br />Surround Sound: Verdict: TIE<br /><br />Both do surround sound and both sound awesome, listing to both I am happy with either one. The A50s do 7.1 the Tango's do 5.1. I don't think you need 7.1 as most movies and games aren't even in 7.1 and really that is more used for bigger spaces. Also the 7.1 is almost too much for headphones and can make it a little harder to pinpoint direction like footsteps - you still will be able to great it just may be a little less accurate. 5.1 are plenty for headphones and you will be able topinpoint better in my opinion. So for surround sound, they are both great!<br /><br />Surround Sound Angles: Verdict: Tango<br /><br />Astro A50: none<br /><br />Turtle Beach Tango: 6 surround angles. This is a very cool feature that lets you select 6 different surround angles,. The angles are basically simulating different distance and angle setups for the front and rear speakers and it works well. I use setting 5<br /><br />Comfort:  Verdict: Turtle Beach Tango; Feels great even with extended gaming.<br /><br />I wore both headsets for extended periods of gaming<br /><br />Astro A50:<br />They are a heavy headset. The ear cushions feel great no issue at all however the head strap felt uncomfortable after about 40 minutes due to the weight and was definitely noticeable. After longer game time I started adjusting the position of them on my head.<br /><br />Turtle Beach Tangos<br />They have memory foam, are lighter and they did not get uncomfortable at any time of extended gaming, they never got heavy feeling.<br /><br />Presets EQs: Verdict: Tango<br /><br />Astro A50s: Have 3 presets<br />Out of the 3 presets only number 3 sounded great, the other two I doubt I would use they just didn't sound that different yet they weren't as good and the volume was weaker.<br /><br />Turtle Beach Tangos: Have 9 presets:<br />I use number 4 and it sounds great. Each preset sounds different from each other. There are presets to focus on footsteps, action, chat - you name it.<br /><br />Customizable EQ: Verdict: Tango<br /><br />Astro A50: no option for user generated EQ settings, the 3 presets is what you are stuck with<br /><br />Tangos: Has an awesome feature and software that allows the user to create customized EQ presets for audio and chat. The online community will even upload presets specific for various games. Treyarch even has a preset specific for COD Black Ops 2.<br /><br />Microphone: Verdict: Tangos<br /><br />Astro A50: The microphone is hardwired to the headset so you can't remove it. This concerns me because if there is ever an issue with the MIC you will need to pay to ship it to Astro to have them repair it. To mute the Mic you have to flip it up, to un-mute you flip it back down - so this will be getting plenty of wear. I do not like the idea of not having a removable Mic and I don't like having to flip it up and down to Mute and Unmute.<br /><br />Tango:  Has a super bendy removable microphone which is nice, if I ever need a new one I can just order it and put it on myself. To mute the microphone there is button you press which I prefer. I can also remove the mic if I am just streaming music or using it with my tablet or vita.<br /><br />Chat clarity: Verdict: Tie<br /><br />Both sounded great<br /><br />Chat Presets:  Verdict: Tango<br /><br />Astro A50: None.<br /><br />Tango: 9 chat presets, some even alter the voice pitch. Again you can create custom ones if you want.<br /><br />BlueTooth: Verdict: Tango<br /><br />Astro A50: No Bluettoth feature at all. You have to use these headsets with the transmitter or they will not work on their own. You can run a wire to the back of the transmitter from a headphone jack of something like an Ipod but you need to stay connected to the transmitter.<br /><br />Tango: Bluetooth on the headset. You can connect two Bluetooth devices at once so you can answer or make a call while gaming or even stream music. You can also use the headphones as a real stand along headset with a tablet or smart phone or even a Vita. This feature alone gives me so much value out of the Tango headphones. The Tango's can be used for any Bluetooth device and doesn't need to have the transmitter in range, they can be used as independent headphones - I can take them to work if I want and stream music from my smartphone.<br /><br />Style: Verdict : Tango<br /><br />Astro A50: The head set is nice but the stand looks cheap and doesn't form fit the headphones very well. I actually thought it looked bad on the stand, lots of dead space and kind of just hangs there.<br /><br />Turtle Beach Tango: Looks great, the stand is the transmitter and fit the headphones. It looks awesome with the orange trim on both the headphones and transmitter.<br /><br />Connection<br />No issues on either one, no static or pops. Both use the 5ghz bandyou can't remove it.

B0097AQEOK|5.0|It is the music that counts and in this case it is utterly sublime. The Studio Albums 1968-1979 gathers together Joni Mitchell's ten albums from that purple period when she was unimpeachable and touched by the angels. It commences with her David Crosby produced debut \\"Song of the Seagull\\" (1968), obviously includes the transcendent \\"Blue\\" (1971) and takes us up to the haunting jazz of 1979s \\"Mingus\\" coloured in with a backdrop provided by those giants of the genre Jaco Pastorius and Wayne Shorter. It does not include the live double \\"Miles of Ailes\\" and as a Rhino production there is no fancy remastering to speak of. It is all housed in simple card sleeves and held in a lift-off lid box. Unfortunately you will need X Ray eyes or a microscope to read the tiny lyrics on the gatefold sleeves, but you will pay $3.60 per album from some suppliers and be blown away by an artist who deserves to be right up there with Dylan, Cohen, Simon and Young and who regularly surpassed all of them. Indeed Joni Mitchell has often suffered at the hands of male rock critics who have tended to underplay her central importance and treated her output beyond \\"Blue\\" almost as a story of decline. Mitchell herself has become totally aliented with the music business and occasionally ventures into the press to launch pointed broadsides. This has included verbal assaults on Dylan and her view that we live in a \\"self destructive era\\" and that \\"the material girl\\" signifies a sense of musical rupture and controversially that \\"Americans have decided to be stupid and shallow since 1980. Madonna is like Nero; she marks the turning point.\\" Some might say she is getting cranky with age but Joni is never dull and has lived a life that soundtracked the Woodstock generation, pushed the boundaries of popular music into expansive genres and played out the drama's of her personal life in songs so intimate that you feel that she is sitting across that table where she \\"hides behind bottles in dark cafes\\".<br /><br />We forget that Mitchell came to recording almost fully formed. This was an artist whose early catalog was so strong that she chose to omit from her debut album three of her compositions that had already been recorded by a variety of other singers \\"Both Sides Now,\\" \\"The Circle Game\\" and \\"Urge for Going.\\" The early pure folk beauty of \\"I had a king\\", \\"Chelsea Morning\\" and the shimmering glow of \\"For Free\\" evolves quickly into an astounding trilogy of albums starting with Blue, punctuated with the \\"For the Roses \\" and concluding with the overwhelming excellence of \\"Court and Spark\\". Any self respecting music collection will own these album's and by now should have worn the vinyl thin, if you don't then you must at minimum in the run up to the yuletide season seek out the best and bluest Christmas song ever \\"The River\\" or marvel in wonder at the opening line to \\"Court and Spark\\" as she articulates how \\"Love came to my door/With a sleeping roll/And a madman's soul/He thought for sure I'd seen him/Dancing up a river in the dark/Looking for a woman/To court and spark\\".<br /><br />This reviewer never came close to comprehending the dour reception of some critics to the \\"The Hissing of Summer lawns\\", not least the carping about its jazzy roots and rhythms. Rolling Stone absurdly described it as \\"great collection of pop poems with a distracting soundtrack\\". It is in fact one of her greatest albums from the dazzling lyrical wordplay of \\"Harrys House/Centrepiece\\", the unadulterated joy of \\"In France they kiss on Main Street\\" to the aching regret of that melody in the \\"Boho Dance\\" which starts with the classic Mitchell line \\"Down in the cellar in the Boho zone / I went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well / Just another hard-time band / With Negro affectations\\". Prince once said it was the \\"last album he loved all the way through\\" and that boy always knew a good tune. To prove a point she then followed it with the huge double punch of 1978s \\"Hejira\\" an album as closeto perfection as is humanly possible. It includes the roguish \\"Coyote\\" which she performed live in the film of the Band's \\"Last Waltz\\"; the wonderlust of \\"Amelia\\" and the \\"hexagram of the heavens\\" and most of all her partnership with that bassist extraordinaire the god like genius of Jaco Pastorius whose playing throughout especially on the title track defies gravity. The double album follow up \\"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\\" did receive mixed reviews and is slightly uneven. The sixteen minute long \\"Paprika Plains\\" has never really been a particular favourite but any album that includes the epic \\"Jericho\\" (what was Jaco smoking?) and songs like the amusing, self-deprecating \\"Talk to Me\\" deserves your rapt attention. Finally putting lyrics to the intense 3AM smokey jazz of Charlie Mingus was always going to be controversial but on 1979s \\"Mingus\\" where Mitchell meets Weather Report there is much to be admired not least the haunting \\"Good bye Pork Pie Hat\\" and the funky \\"God must be a boogie man\\".<br /><br />The ten albums in question included in this set are in chronological order -<br /><br />* Song To A Seagull (1968)<br />* Clouds (1969)<br />* Ladies of the Canyon (1970)<br />* Blue (1971)<br />* For The Roses (1972)<br />* Court and Spark (1974)<br />* The Hissing Of Summer Lawns (1975)<br />* Hejira (1976)<br />* Don Juan's Reckless Daughter (1977)<br />* Mingus (1979)<br /><br />Within these ten albums is some of the best recorded music of the 20th Century. These songs are timeless raindrops, and an exquisite testimony to the redemptive and reflective power of music. When It comes to Joni Mitchell who could not be personally supportive of the English actress Emma Thompson's remark \\"I love her. And true love lasts a lifetime\\".to perfection as is humanly possible.

B000MRBAUK|5.0|When CASABLANCA was widely released to theaters in January 1943, its producers and Warner's had no inkling that this would become a cinematic immortal. (Events similar to what occurred with Fox's 1951 sci-fier, [[ASIN:B00005JKFR THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL]].)<br /><br />In the seven decades since a never mounted stageplay called \\"Everybody Comes to Rick's\\" was adapted for the screen by the Epstein twins and Howard Koch, CASABLANCA has spawned two short-lived TV series, but wisely on the part of filmmakers, no motion picture rehashes. Here we have an ideal cast following a perfect script; a timeless love story that ends happily for no one that's set in a North African stopping point for refugees of a merciless war. Their German oppressors are here as well in these final days before the Allied invasion of North Africa.<br /><br />Former gun runner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns \\"Rick's Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain\\", a place that folks of all political persuasions and nationalities gravitate to. His loyal friend and piano artist&eacute; Sam (Dooley Wilson) performs every song but one, that is until Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) wanders in, spots him at the keys and coos, \\"Play 'As Time Goes By'.\\" When Rick storms over to chastise Sam for the song he never wants to hear, he and Ilsa are reunited. We soon learn of their affair in Paris and sudden parting while Germans marched in, Rick's hard feelings at Ilsa's disappearance that day, and the love which yet remains within him.<br /><br />All this amid the chaos of other lives, people scrambling for impossible to get papers of transit even as an ever-present enemy heightens their awareness of danger. The Italian Ugarte (Peter Lorre) gives Rick two of these priceless letters just before he's arrested by Louis Renault (Claude Rains), a corrupt police captain. Ugarte dies in custody, leaving an embittered Rick with the dilemma of giving the transit docs to Ilsa and her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a Czech Resistance refugee, or saving them for his own escape. Lazlo selflessly suggests that Rick use the papers to escort Ilsa to safety while he remains in Casablanca. Then Laszlo is arrested by Renault on a false charge...<br /><br />CASABLANCA is the one film that all Classic Era movie fans should own, and the one to be seen repeatedly.

We used a [[ASIN:B000F9J886 laser disc]] of it to demonstrate the capabilities of high end projection TVs like [[ASIN:B0000206GS SONY]] and [[ASIN:B003HINHKC MITSUBISHI]]. That opening sequence with its anticipatory theme music and scenes of jets taking off from and landing on a carrier deck always enervated potential customers, which in turn made all of us \\"lot lizards\\" a bundle of loot.<br /><br />I must've watched certain parts of this film 200 times, no exaggeration, but a recent viewing is maybe the third time I've ever sat through it from beginning to end. TG is a blood-stirring actioner with lots of date night treats for us ladies, such as the beach volleyball scene. All those shirtless young guys! Val Kilmer was cut and didn't have an ounce of fat on him. How things can change in a mere quarter-century.<br /><br />Seeing it again was a very nostalgic experience for me, but in the cold light of analysis I've gotta admit this picture has a glaring flaw near the end. A flight of six MIG's commanded by black-suited pilots of unknown origin, without provocation or explanation attacks two American fighters. One of our jets is downed. 'Maverick' (Cruise) comes to the rescue of 'Iceman' (Kilmer), his hated class rival who won the coveted Top Gun trophy. Mav' splashes a few of the enemy and saves the day. Hoohahs all around the carrier deck. Yet, wouldn't such a dogfight bring on war with some other nation?<br /><br />OK, it's only a movie, and a darned entertaining one, especially if fast planes and handsome young pilots are your turn-on. One thing is sure: in my neck of the woods, TOP GUN was responsible for the proliferation in dozens of homes of 45\\" and 52\\" television sets and rack stereos (with surround sound).

B00783NWB6|5.0|This movie was well thought out for what in my opinion is a going to be a great new few movies. I hope they follow up with this! I think that this is a good beginning for what I hope is a new trilogy in the series. I liked the way they started where the other one left off also.

B005LY4B0A|4.0|I don't play this game much, but I have it on my phone for my nephews (ages 6 and 3) to play, and they love it! I like that they learn puzzle-solving while they think they're just playing a game.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book provides insight about the experience one man had after essentially dying. It is particulary relevant given the writer's occupation. From a scientific perspective is has to be some of the strongest evidence to date.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a fun read although very far fetched at times. MB the main character is likeable and interesting. The ending seemed somewhat anti climactic and abrupt. Has Grisham done sequels in the past??
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow! I had a hard time getting into this book, but have patience, and keep reading. It amazes me that the authur had so many details and crazy ideas to keep Amy ahead of the game. I am glad I kept reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Got the first book for free and was immediately hooked. These kept me interested through the many twists and turns. I am looking forward to more books (hint, hint).
B007KZY1YY|1.0|It is so odd to think that a woman can write such erroneous waffle. Do we really want in 2012 to return to the stereotypical female eunach.  There is too much belittling of women and this regurgitated  set of shallow characters is either laziness or money grabbing at their worst.  Not worth buying hence one star.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A great read that keeps you page turning and excited. Also an interesting in site into modern technology and how it is being used in the war against terrorism. I have read most of Nelson's books and this one is, in my opinion, one of the best.
B0018J48LE|1.0|The show stopped more than 20 times in an hour.  It seriously took almost 90 minutes to watch an hour show.  The problem was not the internet connection.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A great tale, a little different from Grisham's usual legal thrillers, and a wonderful time all around.  He says he didn't \\"research\\" at all, just made it all up -- and it's worth the ride.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I am listening to \\"Music From Another Dimension\\" for the second time and, as with most new releases by older groups, it's growing on me.  Sure, it doesn't sound like \\"Rocks\\", but why should it?  That was almost 40 years ago!  Can you believe that?  These guys are 60+ years old and like me and YOU, yes YOU, they have aged and changed and so has their music.  Great?  Maybe not, but present day Aerosmith?  Oh yeah!  I saw them live recently and they still rock!  Soon we're not going to have the pleasure of listening to anything new from classic groups like this because they're going to retire.<br /><br />No break down of the tracks from me.  Some are good, some not so good, but I buy CDs for everything that's on them and I'll listen to all of them.  All 15 of these songs will join the 17000+ on my Ipod which includes the rest of the Aerosmith catalog.  Do I like the ballads?  Yes.  I haven't created an Aerosmith image that excludes songs like \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" or \\"Don't Want To Miss A Thing\\".  Why does everybody hate that song?<br /><br />As for Amazon's service, I received this CD on the day it was released.  In all the orders I have placed through Amazon I have never had a problem.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had chosen a 5 star rating because this is a 10 star book but unfortunately they only grade to 5.  I would read this book over and over and that is what will happen I'm sure.

B006VGGAC4|4.0|Amazing when you think about making it in this world wih hard work and determination and a willingness to learn and explore options . Didn't read this for the parts about affairs but to find out what made him tick ! Walked away actually liking the man.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I began reading John Grisham books with \\"A Time to Kill\\" and have read everyone of his novels since then. Even the non-legal ones have held my attention from start to finish. There is no better storyteller in America today.

0062220837|1.0|Just canceled this order, so I didn't actually get this book...but my fears were true that this version is nothing more than the regular Gift Edition with a slipcase, signature and limited numbered.  Probably worth $50 as a collector but not $150. Lame.
B008I43DYU|4.0|all the best stuff is here .  nice layout,  from simple math to logarrthmic calculations this app has it all.  and nice skins to boot.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This is an addictive game!  There is no way to lose, and you can put it down for as long as you want and your dragons are waiting for you when you get back.  Everything is doable without spending cash, but easier if you do.  It's great that other people only help.  It sufferes from way too many popups ingame.  I saw the first time that there is a zombie dragon, thankyouverymuch.  It has added a good new reward tutorial system to make it easier to start out.  It uses up battery like no other app and heats up my phone.  But thats the price you pay for well done vector graphics.
0307716546|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat, and touched my heart.  That's a rare combination for a mystery novel.  I'm recommending this to everyone I know.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app works great on the Kindle Fire and has a variety of plans to choose from. I would recommend it to everyone. Especially if you struggle with reading the Bible daily and understanding how it applies to your life.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|This is a wonderful arrangement of piano and cello, no other instruments are used.  A very creative production that delighted me.  Very ingenious to use the actual strings of the piano to create different sounds, like other instruments.  Delightful.
0142000655|5.0|A brilliant story told with passionate prose. I couldn't put it down. The characters are so deep and so strong and so seductive in their musings, madness, and greed that I had to know what they were going to do next. And Steinbeck does not dissapoint.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Both challenging and fun! You'll get just as much enjoyment watching your bridge construction fail as well as succeed! Can be challenging at times, but stick with it and you'll feel pseudo-smart in no time!
B00A2H9LK6|4.0|I loved the first movie so I knew I had to go see the 2nd. I really liked that it is based off of the game. And I really liked the way that it ended. You can tell that they are thinking about making a 3rd! I'm so excited they finially brought these movies back! I hope that we don't have to wait another 6 years for the next one though. My only complaint about this one was that it didn't feel as creepy to me as the first one did. The \\"monsters\\" didn't have as much screen time as I would have liked. Also there was alot of time spent outside of Silent Hill. When I watch these movies I expect to be creeped out just like I am when I play the games...and this one just didn't do that 3/4 of the time. Hopefully the next one has more bosses and more of that creepy feel....it would be unstopable!
B000PC0U1W|5.0|First, I got this movie very quickly. It was faster than I expected, but I am glad I did, because I watched it the same night. haha<br /><br />I think the quality of the blue ray lent to the story a more vivid and stark picture of the world of the movie. I just love the story, but it is a conflicting story where you love the hero although he is a terrorist, but you understand why he is doing what he is doing because of the wrongs done to him and you feel his pain and the pain of the people in this story....very thought provoking....<br /><br />Hugo Weaving is amazing as \\"V\\", his voice was made for this movie and he poured himself into the character. Natalie Portman was good as \\"Evie\\", she gave a true believeability to the part and although at times i was like really? with her, her reactions were spot on....<br /><br />Get this movie, it will make you think aobut what we think is right and wrong and is the price for vengence worth the cost.
B00006878K|5.0|This 1967 release by Albert King is one of the essential albums for any blues fan.<br /><br />All the tracks on this album are available on a 2CD Albert King Greatest Hits release but this is the original album and the original song order.<br /><br />Several tracks from this album have become standards. Kansas City is the Lieber/Stoller classic; Born Under A Bad Sign was covered by Cream in 1968; The Hunter was covered by both Free and Bob Seger in the early 1970s; Personal Manager and Oh, Pretty Woman have been covered by Gary Moore (among others); Laundromat Blues was covered by Rory Gallagher and so on.<br /><br />The album was recorded at the Stax Records studio in Memphis with many of the great musicians in the Stax house band backing King. Backing musicians include Steve Cropper on guitar, Isaac Hayes and Booker T. Jones (of Booker T & the M.G.'s fame) on piano, Donald Dunn n bass, Al jackson jr on drums.<br /><br />Overall, one of the best blues albums ever recorded. It's also one of the most influential blues albums of any era. This is a classic; if you're a blues fan, you need to have this album in your collection.

B008GVD6D8|4.0|This second book is awesome! Fifty shades has nothing on this. Can't wait for third book in the trilogy- ace
1451638450|5.0|So I lost a night's sleep for this book and it was worth every minute. Yes, I am a longtime Bujold fan and adore Miles and company. That said, I was thrilled when I first learned Ivan was getting his own book. Then I downloaded it as soon as it was available and lost that night's sleep. Then I went back and reread half the series over the next few days--Memory, Komarr and A Civil Campaign are my power trilogy after Cordelia's Honor is revisited. Other obligations have me rereading the rest more slowly.<br /><br />That said, I don't think this one requires previous knowledge--it stands alone better than most. My first entry into the series was A Civil Campaign which is much richer after reading the series but was sufficient to become my gateway book into one of my top favorite series ever. I laughed and squirmed throughout this new book with my husband asking questions as he watched me experience it. It's on the same humor level of Civil Campaign, actually, the most reminiscent of that one in tone.<br /><br />I have always loved Ivan and don't begrudge him his moment in the spotlight--I loved it. No, Cryoburn wasn't one of my favorites since I admit as much as I adore Miles, I like his universe of friends and family, too, and this book provided glimpses of so many of them that I was grinning for days afterwards. And several days later when I mentioned the series and new book to my father--who I introduced the series to years ago--I got a warm daddy/daughter bonding moment when he said, \\"One of the most memorable gifts ever. You never forget that.\\" If you don't know what I mean, go start reading Cordelia's Honor and plan to lose some sleep with no regrets. You get action, adventure, romance and even more than enough deep thoughts to make you feel like your entertainment is not empty. More like this please! PRETTY, PRETTY PLEASE!
B008DVKTMW|5.0|Let's not waste time--this London band's debut is one of those stunning albums that just grabs<br />  hold of you before the first song is over, and never lets go.  Immediately accessible and naturally<br />  inspiring with a fascinating celestial sense of dramatic flourish, these are soaring psychedelic<br />  pop/rock tunes with trippy wave-fluffs of guitar & keyboard that swirl in and out of gorgeously<br />  driving, candy-coated rhythms.  From the sugary voluminosity of epic pop/shoegaze songs to<br />  mesmerizing strobe-light instrumental passages to engulfing motorik hypno-beats, this is an<br />  irresistible, broad-spectrum album with instant and lasting appeal.  Musical styles reference<br />  many bands, including the Horrors, Tame Impala, Neu!, Spiritualized, Psychedelic Furs, Ride,<br />  the Teardrop Explodes, Brian Jonestown Massacre, Low Frequency In Stereo, Sonic Youth,<br />  Cluster, Echo & the Bunnymen, The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart, Baby Woodrose, the Cure.<br />  This is an album I can listen to again and again...and again, truly exceptional!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is okay, but could be better #justsayin I don't like the updates or that you have to pay so much for a game like lower the price man -_-
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As a zombie movie fan I must say this is my favorite season so far.  This season's first episode was zombie fan heroin.  Blood letting frenzy.  Still some of the drama, but the payoff is there.  Survival atmosphere with common sense.  Lovin it so far (3 episodes).
B008S80OU2|5.0|I have been waiting for this for sometime,this box set is worth every penny!

I will be jammin' on this all night! I highly recommend BUY IT NOW!!!

B0074D3CAQ|2.0|This is a touching story about the emotional evolution of an extremely truncated man late in his life.  He decides to go on a miracle walk to help the only person he ever percieved as standing up for him.  The family and the friend he is supporting are extreme and if you have time for an unusual and boring journey go ahead.  I wish I had walked away.

0385535147|5.0|A black lawyer stuck in prison comes up with a scheme to get himself out: he offers investigators key information about the murder of a judge.  But when the lawyer gets out of jail, the murder investigation doesn't exactly proceed as planned.  When the investigators try to track the lawyer down to find out just what is going on, they realize they may have been duped.  John Grisham offers readers one of his finest books in his breezy novel The Racketeer.<br /><br /> Malcolm Bannister has landed in a federal prison camp due to one key reason: his own stupidity.  As a young eager lawyer he executes a deal that creates a curious set of circumstances, sending him to prison for a ten-year sentence.  After five years Malcolm has decided he has had enough.  He's sick of prison life, he wants out, and he has key information tied to the murder of a federal judge that can function as his \\"get out of jail free\\" card.<br /><br /> Prison officials and the investigators who have landed the unfortunate job of having to figure out who killed the judge all think Malcolm just wants to play the game, but Malcolm insists he knows who killed the judge.  Because the judge was found dead in a compromising position--with a young female assistant and in front of an empty safe in his hideaway cabin in the mountains--investigators decide to give Malcolm a chance to roll the dice.  And suddenly Malcolm finds himself with a shot of winning his way out.<br /><br /> Malcolm strikes a deal with the government that pardons him for his \\"crime\\" and lets him enter the witness protection program.  The investigators proceed with tracking down the person Malcolm has named, and Malcolm takes full advantage of his new life.  But he's not playing by the rules the government set, and when Malcolm's position in his new life becomes compromised the FBI swoops in to try to figure out what Malcolm's next move should be.  Except that Malcolm doesn't want to play by the government's rules anymore and flips the entire game on its head by a move no one expects.<br /><br /> By choosing a black protagonist for his latest novel, Grisham provides readers with a different viewpoint.  But black or white, Grisham knows his legal matters and (by extension) the legal thriller.  This book easily solidifies Grisham as an expert in the latter.  Some readers may complain that Grisham's novels follow a familiar pattern: the underdog fights and eventually wins against a variety of villains.  In The Racketeer the villain comes in the form of the federal government.<br /><br /> Grisham's detailing makes him stand head and shoulders above so many others who attempt this genre.  He never fails to throw in details in a seemingly casual manner, only to make those very details the focal point of the plot late in the book.  The Racketeer follows this same formula, but it's a formula that works and will indeed keep readers up late at night.<br /><br /> I highly recommend The Racketeer and sincerely feel it's one of Grisham's best books.  Grisham fans will enjoy it from Page 1 to The End, and anyone wanting to try one of his books for the first time would do well by choosing this as one of their first Grisham experiences.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This is great for copying slides to .jpg format. I am very happy with it. It is the second one I have had. The first did not work at all. The tech people at the company were very quick with their responses both email and phone. I was very impressed with them. I would recommend this item for slide reading. I have not tried film or negatives.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I am very happy with my season 2 of The Walking Dead. I have been a fan, and now i get to share my experience without scratches or anything. Would recommend it!
B0031RS2HC|3.0|Initially I liked this book however it quickly becomes, how can I put this, Meh! I found myself with better things to do than continue reading and it became an effort just to finish. \\"The dialogue sounds like something a 14 year old would write, right!\\" I said.
B003L8GPT8|2.0|This release is a compressed unpleasant sounding  listening experience. Audiophile my ASS. The original mint condition release I have on vinyl sounds Awesome and a thousand times better to the ear. At first we thought it might be my friends stereo so We then played it on my $12,000 System and it sounds just as bad !. I am glad I didn't purchase it. A good mate of mine isn't happy parting with the money tho. Please AVOID and shop around for an original copy or a 70's or 80's reissue.I really don't understand Record company's releasing Digital remastered Crap like this. Don't fix what ain't ben broke I say.
B008NABUU8|3.0|Bridge 6, level 3 I think it is, can't be completed correctly because one of the anchor points was not available
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham has turned out another \\"keep you guessing\\" read.  A little slow in the beginning but then<br />it picks up speed and you won't want to put it down. Twists and turns abound.
B004I744AS|5.0|The Kindle Fire comes with a dictionary which found to be incredibly difficult to use.  I found this substitute in the apps.  The standards this set is more than I could have imagined.  My only complaint is I cant limit the browser when I look for word specics such as begins with or ends with.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really liked the second part of this series. I would have liked a bit more suspense over the villain at the end, maybe him leaving evidence for Eva that he was in the city, stalking her or making his presence known.  Also more of a build up and climax (no pun intended) at Gideon's big storyline. I don't want to give anything away!!  This is a great book and well worth reading.  The third book doesn't come out until May 2013!  Why?  We want it now!! I don't want to wait for delayed gratification!!
B007JMW46U|5.0|From what I understand, the character Sherlock Holmes is THE most often portrayed character in all of English-speaking cinema.  That should tell you something about the quality of these stories.  I've enjoyed them for nearly 50 years now and they never grow old.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was so, so , so good!!!! I won't do a synopsis, I hate those, but I will say the intensity of the charachters really made the story.  I really love how it all came together.
B0089DQBQC|5.0|Great book. Read it (it's an order!). My only comment within this edition is the \\"Illustrated edition\\" tag. Not really illustrated. About 7 images of someone that I can imagine is Robert Louis Stevenson (writer) are placed at the end. Not even a footnote on the images, explanation or a simple reference. Not what I expected by \\"illustrated\\". Anyway, the rest is excellent. Great book, great story, great writing.
0439813786|5.0|this book is amazing. i bought it for my 9 year old child and she reads it a lot. she read it once in 2 hours. it is a picture book and a chapter book. it is about a kid named Hugo and he is a thief and his dad and mom died. his life is really difficult. parents you should buy this for your child and you should buy the second book, \\"wonder struck\\". this author is amazing. this book is full of mysteries too! this book is enjoyable at night as a bed time story 1 chapter a day and is for all ages. my daughters grandma also loves this book. just saying she is 84.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Once you get a grip on all the characters and how they tie into each other as well as the previous volume than this is great and quick reading. This book is excellent.  Keeps moving, amazing how Follet can tie a fiction novel in with realiatic actual events of the time.
B001NTLYKC|5.0|WOW what a great download.  This CD captures a special place that will never be again.  British white boy soul meets pre arena rock swagger. This beautiful set of tunes belongs in a time capsule as an example of what rock and roll meant in 1971.  Steve Marriot's singing is amazing and the power of that band at that time is undeniable. I can't stop playing this thing and the long jam session live feel is a beautiful escape from the world of formulaic pop jingles.  If you are a rock and roll fan - you need this.
B004RKXNDU|5.0|I recently watched the new Tinker Tailor movie. It inspired me to read the book again. John LeCarre crafts a compelling story and the book can be enjoyed just from that point of view. Fiction is a great way to portray the paranoia of the cold war and the shifting relationship between the British and American secret services. However, I found myself reading paragraphs over and over - amazed at how well they were written. Just enough description to make you feel \\"there.\\" Just enough cleverness and humor but with little modern snark. Clear, concise language. I went back to the first George Smiley book- \\"Call for the Dead\\" written in 1961 and found the same quality. I followed with \\"The Spy who came in from the Cold\\" and \\"The Looking Glass War.\\" It's amazing these books were written in his spare time in small apartments with his family underfoot, while working long hours overseas for the British foreign service.<br />Tinker Tailor is my favorite of all his books. It shows maturity in both the writing and the story structure. It is interesting to read after seeing both films. The book reinforces how much better the BBC version is- truer to the book yet standing on its own choices of powerful visual imagery.  I've read that LaCarre preferred the BBC Tinker Tailor to any other filmed version of his books, including Richard Burton in \\"The Spy.\\" I suspect the film has the most power because it started from the strongest book. The tension of Peter Guillam's visit to The Circus to steal files is just as paralyzing in the book as in the movie- even when you know how it works out. In a way the earlier books seem to culminate in \\"Tinker, Tailor.\\" And speaking of Peter, his back story in the book makes him a more understandable and sympathetic character.<br />If you have only seen the new film, please do yourself a favor and read the book. Then go back and read \\"Call\\" and meet a younger George, chasing spies in the fog and still believing he can get Anne back.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Unlike so many others, I will NOT rate the packaging [see below], just the movie. It was great...and if you don't get emotional at the end your heart is stone.<br />I do have a concern about the packaging - I will be gifting the BR disc and keeping the DVD for myself.  It seems the new trend is to put all the bells and whistles on the BR and leaving crumbs or worse for the people who buy just the DVD version.  It was the same with 'The Avengers'.  I gifted the BR and kept the DVD; they got all the extra items and I got very little. Perhaps I should ask Santa for a BR player ;)<br />Either way, enjoy the movie!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is extremely fun and a great way to pass the time. I also like how it actually makes you think to figure out the puzzles. it gets more challenging as you continue which is great. I would definitely recommend this app for people of all ages. very fun!!!!
B00338QELU|4.0|Although the detail on what this book was about on the Amazon website, It wasn't what I expected. This book started out very slow, but after a couple of chapters, it became very difficult to put down.  The main character of this book has some personal problems that I thought were overdone, but the story line was excellent and has some very strange suprises.<br />I recommend this book for all you suspense connisseuers. The main characters in this book, past and present keep the reader wanting to find out more.

Like... very very Japanese.\\" \\"This Japanese?\\" \\"No no no . . . more Japanese!\\" If you think it would be interesting to see UNSC ODST soldiers stand in awkwardly-gawking-shivering-wide-eyed-shock the way only Anime teenage characters can - this is for you. If you think it'd be neat to watch aliens on an alien world, talk, dress, act and battle to the death like Shoguns and ninjas - this is for you. If you want to see extraordinarily cheap animation - this is for you. If you want to be surprised by the fact that a Spartan CAN be a sexy girl....TWICE.... (seriously? is it 1950?) -  this is for you. If you want to see an officially licensed product that makes fan-art look sleek and sophisticated by comparison - this is for you. If you think that paying for all of the above is borderline retarded - this is NOT for you.<br /><br />I found this experience appallingly bad and am surprised that it is associated with the Halo franchise. I am deeply troubled that reviews for this trash are mixed. I am moved to pity that some of the minds behind this work are actually paid well for their talent and are apparently encouraged to continue their work.<br /><br />*Disclaimer*<br />It should be noted that I love Japanese people of all sorts. I enjoy anime at about the same rate I enjoy Hollywood - most of it is crap. I don't feel being drawn makes bad productions good - let alone drawn as cheaply as possible - which is how anime developed it's aesthetic in the first place. On a serious note - if you are a fan of anime you will probably love to see the Halo universe rendered through it. At least the stories make sense.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was both exciting and riveting in John Grisham fashion. Held my attention and I read it from cover to cover. Great!
0446547646|4.0|Such a good book! It had all the elements of a good read.  A little Notebookish, but still enjoyed it.  A nice weekend read to take you away!
B000U0F7RG|4.0|Picked this up as a gift for my wife, who is a HUGE Gilmore Girls fan, along with our oldest daughter. She loved everything about it, from the way it was packaged (very fitting for the series) to the bonus book of \\"Gilmore-isms\\". The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the wait. It arrived a week late for her birthday, though it was ordered and shipped in plenty of time to have arrived before then. They used US Postal Service, as the only offered shipping option... c'mon guys. Carrier pigeons have those relics beat by a long shot. Let me pay the extra $1 and use a reliable, efficient carrier.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is another great read that every John Corey fan must get. Well paced and full of intrigue, DeMille delivers once again!
1449410243|4.0|Though I don't have a cat, I bought this book, because I absolutely loved the first one (5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth) and was a bit disappointed when I've finished this in ~2 hours. It's shorter than the previous one and it doesn't contain as much new stuff. Comics are beautiful, though I've read most of them a long time ago on TheOatmeal. Print quality is very high, drawings look delightful. Waiting for the next book from Matthew)
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|I bailed at the 80% mark; I guess I wasn't in the mood for a soul-searching fatalistic view of the human condition, with or without cancer, with or without the chance of redemption. Perhaps I missed the salient point by quitting but there wasn't enough foreshadowing of a useful (not necessarily good or bad) ending or meaning and it was too sad to endure. So like Van Houten who stopped writing, I stopped reading.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|How can any reader ignore the fact that a good part of our past few years of intimacy with Harry Potter has come to an end? My only joy is in the fact that my grandchildren are now immersed in Harry's adventlures and that give us a cross-generational opportunity to share our thoughts, interpretations and enjoyment.
B003498SDA|4.0|compelling, suspenseful, unforgettable. . .<br /><br />This is an extraordinary movie. The plot is taut and fast-paced, the dialog clever, the characters exceptionally acted, with touches of philosophy.<br /><br />The only flaw is occasionally imperfect logic. Specifically, the cabdriver did have a chance to get away and call the police half-way through. Why didn't he? He could have warned the police of the danger to his mother.
B009UQCD0K|5.0|Was writing this review for episode #4 Season 3.<br /><br />They are breaking up that old gang of mine.<br /><br />Core cast members must be retained. Shane's death was catastrophic to this show. He was the key character in my opinion.  The series never fully recovered from his demise. Walking Dead must hold on to Herschel as tightly as a miser to 100 dollar bills. Herschel is the MVP of the Walking Dead.<br /><br />If the core cast is completely removed, the show will have no appeal. No amount of transitional plotting is going to make up for the heart and soul of the series being dropped like flies.<br /><br />Wonder how many core characters deaths are linked to salary demands.<br /><br />Sarah Callies, Lori Grimes died bravely. As if she were going to meet her Prison Break soul mate in the after life.<br /><br />I know, Sarah Callies in a remake of LifeForce with a special appearance from Patrick Stewart. Art for art's sake, always remember the cast are always artists-snicker.<br /><br />Think the cast of the Walking Dead watch the show after they are eaten?
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I didn't expect much from this movie, not a Tom Cruse fan.  But I was pleasantly surprised, he did an outstanding job as did the rest of the cast.  I enjoyed the music, it was well done and the plot was entertaining.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend and loved it! I bought it from the Kindle store so I could have it in my own collection as there is so much useful information in it!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|It's a good movie about the origin of ALIEN, however it tell its own story and put on the table many questions... I hope that It'll have a second part.<br />The new \\"Ripley\\" is good, she is herself as a strong woman, as in original (swedich) version of Millenium.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Like all of Lee Child's books, I could not put this down.  It was a great read with an unexpected ending. Reacher gets into one's skin and it is hard to not enjoy the action he presents when he is present in the story.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Excellent user guide. I got mine in Kindle format and it works perfectly on my tablet with full colour photos etc. It goes into more advanced topics and as you become more able, keep an eye on raspberry pi forums/youtube etc as things are evolving quickly with this amazing little device
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was my first reading of Flynn. It is a style with great promise. I am sure I will enjoy more stories by this author.  Gone girl was slow in parts but in others it was fast moving.  One question that was left hanging is \\"why no one in the plot thought of trying to figure out if she was in fact a prisoner the entire time she was \\"GONE\\"?.\\" Perhaps this left room for a follow up. I really felt the husband was trapped in a situation that he did not deserve at the end. At the same time, he should have had taken preventive methods and had the sperm destoried once he knew his marriage was crumbling. Did the \\"GONE GIRL\\" get away with a perfect CRIME?
B0086700CM|1.0|worst game I had ever played so stupid my recommendation.  would be streaker run I love that game.don't buy temple run you wont like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Reading this book has been a life changing experience. To hear the account of a first hand near death experience from an actual neuroscientist is a real gift to the world.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great story.  Could not put the book down, finished in 2 days.  Suprised but loved the ending.  I have read everyone of John Grishans books and look forward to more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game. On standards for mobile devices. this game is absurdly great. cant wait for next update. you really outdid it this time mojang. the graphics are superb and the speed in both single player and multiplayer is really fast. completely worth its price.
B00846REIS|1.0|As I started reading this based on the reviews I thought it would be a good follow up to 50 Shades, which I loved. This story was basically the same thing with minor differences. I was annoyed everytime I read something similar to 50 shades, whether it was the confident, wealthy man going after the nieve girl, his control, sex toys, too simlar for me where I felt it was pointless to continue reading, so I put it down.<br /><br />Not worth the money at all!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this game download it right now and try it out!!!!! It is amazing that its free!!!Finally the pigs get attention.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|This movie was a delight because of the acting ~ also a nice piece of history! Michelle Williams did great job ~
0307913147|5.0|Easily one of the best books I have read this year, and possibly one of the best books I have ever read! Wil Wheaton did an amazing job narrating, and the story was captivating from the start. It is an adventure-loving reader's dream.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not put it down - from the beginning to the end - it is one of the best books I have ever read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer was very interesting.  It was very well written and captured me.<br />I loved learning about the various activities the the protagonist was<br />involved in.  It had suspense and kept me involved. Unfortunately, there were<br />some times when I wondered what was going on.  Perhaps this was part of the secret<br />of the plot.  The end of the book was pretty amazing and I liked it, in a way.<br />My reason for not giving it 5 stars was that none of the characters was someone<br />that I could admire. No uplifting characters that I would want to know as a friend.<br />Clever and enterprising, but not admirable. This was my first time to read a book<br />on my Kindle, and I really enjoyed that.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game because it is a good time waster. It has some glitches but not to many. I also hope they get a better update
B00571F26Y|3.0|I like the science behind the research, but I didn't like the fact that not only do you have to give up wheat, but most other grains as well.
140191716X|5.0|I am an avid reader and have read literally thousands of books in my lifetime. This book, without a shadow of a doubt, is THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. One point that is important to note is that this same book (also by Doreen Virtue)is available in a paperback version. However, THIS book is labeled a 4-Color \\"Gift Edition\\" for a reason. It is also the MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOK I HAVE EVER SEEN...truly. It is a hardback and unique in the fact that the cover actually wraps around the back to close in front, just before the awesomely beautiful picture of the angel on the front cover. The artwork in this book is also nothing short of AMAZING! The most important part of any book, of course, is it's content; and Doreen outdoes herself in the every day inspirational messages from the angels. You can go through the book page by page or, like me, just pick a random page each day---I am constantly amazed at how appropriate the messages are for what's going on in my life at that particular moment. I have already bought three of these books to share with my family and two friends. I have labeled this book my \\"Angel Bible\\" and I feel lost without it when it's not right next to me on my bedside table. So...if you want to be spiritually guided and inspired, or would like to give an awesome gift to someone dear, THIS IS IT! I wish I could rate this book more than just 5 stars...it truly takes you to the heavens and beyond.
B004PIA4BI|5.0|Saved me a lot by giving my old phone a boost so I wouldn't have to buy a new one at a much higher price.  I figured it was cheaper to try a new battery, for my phone problems, that the Server and the Manufacturer couldn't remedy to find out why my battery would go dead all of a sudden, though it showed I still had an almost full charge. So I purchased this battery and it solved my problem immediately.  I can wait longer to get a new phone now, and save money in the process.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I bought this app wanting an app that would conserve my battery life. After getting it I saw that wasn't the case. However it is everything it said it was. it has a place in my notifications bar. I can now see exactly how much energy I have left. This greatly helps me plan my time.
B005T87QCI|4.0|this game is cool but you guys should put atom in this game please or upgrade these robots please or else
B007L6VR12|1.0|I brought this DVD home to watch because it seemed exactly like the kind of movie I would love: retro, cute, quirky, eclectic and amusing.  \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" tried to be all of those things, but fell far short of the mark.  The movie tried so hard to be those things, in fact, that it was annoying to watch.  The sets and costumes were so overly stylized as to be trite and contrived.  The dialogue was dry and mono-toned, so much so that it seemed that all of the characters were on opiates.  (They weren't)  The characters were weak and undeveloped; you never really cared about any of them or what happened to them.<br /><br />Years ago, Wes Anderson pulled off a huge success very nicely with \\"The Royal Tennenbaums\\", a dry, offbeat story about dysfunctional characters.  He did not manage to recreate the ambiance and delight of that great movie in \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\". The thing that irritated me the most what the use and overuse of Hank Williams' songs throughout the movie.  As an ardent Hank Williams fan, I did not appreciate hearing his great songs bastardized as an inept and ineffective movie score. For one thing, the classic Hank Williams songs evoke the nostalgia of the 1940's and early 1950's, not the mid-1960's.  The use of his iconic songs was one thing that actually ruined this movie for me.  Wes Anderson would have done much better using music that matched the era that he was trying to recreate, (which he was obviously confused about.) Perhaps he should have moved the story to the 40's or 50's. Not that there was much a story.  Putting a coon-skin cap on an awkward boy with nerdy glasses and having him run off to hide with a morose, skinny girl who loves to walk around in her underwear is hardly a story.  This movie has no redeeming value, please do not waste your time.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It is always with trepidation I buy a book I know little or nothing about so when I began reading The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared I didn't have high expectations.  I am so happy I picked it up!!  It is funny in a witty, unpretentious, slap stick kind of way that is so rare.  The story toggles between the 100-year-old-man's 100th birthday and his extraordinary past.  The 100-year-old-man, Allan, is a Forest Gump-esque character whose life has landed him in some unbelievably remarkable situations, not the least of which is his current predicament.  This book is charming and funny with a sense of adventure & whimsy.  I don't want to reveal many details here because this is one of those books best enjoyed with little prior notions.  Suffice it to say I highly recommend reading it, I know I am glad I did!
1449410243|5.0|The Oatmeal is a fantastic artist and has a great wit about him. This is not some 400-page compendium on feline science. Take it for what it is - a great gift book and a funny coffee table piece. It is absolutely brilliant
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book starts off well enough.  But then new charactors are brought in and a twist in the plot seems to be pointless.  The reader is made to feel insecure and wondering if he/she missed something.  Overall, very enjoyable except for that little wrinkle.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I can't wait for next book. The ending left you wanting to read more! The author sold the rights and they're in the process of making a movie.
B008KE3960|4.0|nice game to keep you occupied.  very simple to play once you figure what you are doing... no instructions. otherwise its not too bad.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book leaves a great deal to be desired, for sure.  However, after slogging through to the end, it haunted me for a long time.  The characters were difficult to keep straight, but there were a couple who grabbed your heart and wouldn't let go.
B005COO1X6|3.0|King is always a good read and this fit the bill. Not his best work but short and interesting.<br />His characters seem real and can keep your interest. The ending left me wanting to read more.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Awesome app. I use it all the time. I found it's brutally easy to move between all three of my kindles with this app, and works beautifully with my kindle HD. And the added ability to take pictures with the camera just rocks...
0470913029|5.0|Since going \\"Paleo\\"  I have lost 12 pounds and the \\"muffin top\\" I suddenly acquired when I turned 52!!  It's not always easy to pass up the bread and pasta, but once you do it and see how great you feel, it makes it much easier to just say no to starchy carbs.  I highly recommend the Paleo lifestyle to anyone who is struggling with some extra LBs!!
0316228532|2.0|For those who are thinking that the Potter series makes this a worthwhile read, save your money, and more importantly your time. The writing style that was the most impressive part of Potter is totally lacking in this novel: multiple characters-poorly defined, scenes blended into scenes without cohesion made for a very confusing book. As a big fan of John Irving, I enjoy depressing stories. But the characters have to mean something. What you have here is a story of town full of miserable people who have nothing better to do then be mean. Very disappointing-I was expecting so much more.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|God! If those to don't give up on each other I might. Can't take this anxiety, this book left me with even more questions than answers. I love my Gideon....I suspected what he did for Eva and glad he did. I have a huge lingering question........IS SYLVIA DAY going to tell us what happened the first time Eva found Gideon in his office in suspicious circumstances?<br />I'd like to see Eva take control of the situation and not let Gideon get away with his hot alpha male, megalomaniac domineering ways as much. I'd love some normalcy and perhaps true happiness, they deserve it.<br />As for Corine.....that's it! Eva better kick some @$$ I'm so done with her needy degrading self. She needs to move out of the way and Gideon better show her the door for good.<br />Overall I cried, my heart was heavy with anxiety but a great read none the less.<br /><br />, domineering, sexy self as muc
B0014E9188|5.0|If you're a fan, it's a great set.  If you're not, it's a great introduction to them.  It's a relatively small venue, and the staging is nothing dramatic (which shouldn't surprise any fan), but the performance and audio quality are amazing.  They are, without a doubt, one of the best groups of musicians/writers/producers around today.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really love &amp; depend on this app for my kindle fire. Like the personalization options &amp; that its opens when plugged in. Gives you a breakdown of the % of battery life for multiple uses, reading, web, etc.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Its a great app to share photos. Funny or not. You can follow people and have different boards. I definitely recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first and thought it was good but not great. Then I decided to read the books and I could not put them down. Clear your schedule when you get these books because I'm pretty sure you won't be able to put them down either.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I would give this game 5 stars but I did have a small problem with it causing my Kindle Fire to freeze up twice.  Other than those 2 times I have not had any more problems with it.  I do love playing this game and am happy I downloaded it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Millions of us agree.... Walking Dead is one of the BEST TV SERIES going.  The story line is gripping, unpredictable, and addictive.  The actors are believable causing us to love some and despise others.  This show is a must see and I wish it could go on FOREVER.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy this game. it doesn't take any skill and my grandchildren will sit on my lap for hours playing games so it makes it worth it. everyone should have this game
B0067EKY9K|2.0|Starts off full of enthusiasm for a what promises to be a highly entertaining way of passing the time. And, once things get going, there are a couple of excellent \\"nibbles\\" that heighten the expectation of what's to come. But then things start to drag - nothing much happens and a feeling of creeping boredom sets in as you desperately wait for another \\"nibble\\" to keep your interest up. No luck, and then to make things worse everything starts getting rather wet. By the end of it all you leave feeling pretty disappointed. Ah well... that's fishing for you.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved this book! Really amazing. I love thrillers I also read her other two books she wrote loved those too! I recommend everyone who lives suspense and thrillers to read this book.
B008BWFOVE|1.0|Bored housewife, unappreciated by her husband etc. interviews two student prostitutes, gets intrigued and then turned-on by their seemingly more exciting, more liberated lifestyle. Lots and lots of questioning looks and smiling between the interviewer and interviewees and... that's about it. No real exploration of the realities of these girls' lives, or their clients, a couple of fairly graphic but unerotic scenes and huge amount of well worn cliches. All explored before in the equally insipid, superficial and cliched Belle de Jour. The issues it raises are interesting but, like Belle de Jour, it delivers no answers and the real question is what on earth is Juliette Binoche doing in such a boring and pointless film? A waste of her and your time.
B008OOYALE|4.0|this game is great if you wan to waste some time. I love the different dragon styles and the layout of the game
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This fits my Kindle Fire perfectly. It's meant more as a permanent cover, rather than something you'd continually take your Kindle (or Nook, etc.) in and out of. The cover closes well and stays that way. The red is rich and the writing makes a nice design. It's also lightweight and comfortable to hold.<br /><br />I love the inner pocket. I like to travel light, so I can pop my license and debit card inside and I'm set to go.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|very good item is in brand new condition and was packaged correctly..<br />the person i bought this for will be very pleased!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Always kept me guessing who to trust.  John Grisham is a great writer, he really got me thinking and loving his character!<br />Anne L.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|enjoyed the book, couldnt wait to get to book two. found it to be a good story, maybe a little graphic, definitely not for people under 18.
B009A9ETFE|5.0|I am a long time HIM fan and was pleased with their greatest hits :) I received my order the day before the release and everything :) Can't wait for tears on tape!! THANKS YOU!!
1616960922|4.0|When the Emperor's mind is damaged after an assassination attempt, Shai -- an imprisoned Forger whom has been sentenced to execution must create a Forgery of his soul within 100 days -- a task that would normally take years.<br /><br />With the tenuous promise of safety, Shai must work to understand the mind and heart of the Emperor, while working to uncover the true intent of her captors. One hundred days to forge a soul, to uncover the intent of her captors and to escape from the clutches of the empire.<br /><br />Like in his Mistborn novels, we're shown a character -- the Emperor, a figure of power, one which our protagonist opposes, but comes to understand him to the very core of his being, and as she comes to understand him, so too do we come to understand Shai in much the same way. Developing from being a petty criminal faced with execution, to becoming a master in the arts and manipulation.<br /><br />The Emperor's Soul by Brandon Sanderson is a short fantasy novella. Set in the same world as one of his other novels, Elantris, The Emperor's Soul is a fun and enjoyable story. Sanderson continues to show his ingenuity and creativity with yet another unique magic system, and characters which draw readers into the novel.<br /><br />Having magic, like Soulstamps -- things able to rewrite the history of an object, and pretty much what the object itself is, is an interesting concept. Sanderson details the magic and how it works explicitly, which while it does help to give a clear image of how it works, what Shai is doing and why, it was a bit much. Normally, I thoroughly enjoy the descriptive nature of Sanderson's works, but for a story this size it seemed to detract from the actual storyline.<br /><br />Taking only a few hours to read at most, The Emperor's Soul is a good introductory novel to Sanderson's writing, showing beautiful examples of his characters, world building, and his ability for subtlety, plots and intrigue between characters.<br /><br />While not being one of Sanderson's best works, The Emperor's Soul is still definitely worth the read, and has an interesting cast of characters, telling a fantastical tale where nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
B0055SWM08|5.0|We LOVE this game and it 2nd version,  QUELL REFLECT.  The only problem with either game is that there aren't more...more levels, more versions...MORE!!!!!!  Worth every penny...ESP. when it was free.
B005IKZ1B0|4.0|Nice bit of House songs.  Guetta has a good sound to his music.  I'm not so big into most of the songs, but if for nothing else, get it for Titanium.  Nothing but the Beat-The Electronic Album could be a good choice if you just like the sound of the music itself, since it's not vocal if you find the artists featured on this album kinda annoying.  Titanium though, get it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Ever had a book change your life? The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of those books. I would compare it to Ordinary People or a Separate Peace. Truly an amazing novel. It only takes about a day to read, mostly because you can't put it down. Hands down the best book I've read in years.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I watch and collect a lot of DVD series so it is always nice to get a discount on something that is well worth buying once and watching over and over again.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|I enjoyed every song (literally) of Taylor's previous 3 albums.  This album was junk.  Very disappointing.  Didn't like a single song.  Unlike other reviews, I could care less about \\"stepping out of comfort zones\\" and arristic impression.  What matters is the final product.  This album was a waste of money.  I hope she does better with her next endeavor.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great for all ages.  Not just entertaining, but like many Pixar animated films, has deeper meanings strewn throughout.  Wish I had grandkids to take to see it.
B0000074NU|4.0|I bought this after hearing Tesla play \\"Rock Bottom\\" and at least one other UFO song at the New York State Fair.  \\"Rock Bottom\\" is my favorite song from this CD, and I would buy it all over again just for this song.  Michael Schenker was on top of his game with this song, and I have since watched multiple videos on Youtube with Michael (with or without UFO) that rocked my socks off with this song.  I never really cared about the vocals with any version of \\"Rock Bottom\\" that I've heard, but Michael's guitar more than makes up for it.  Check it out on Youtube, then buy this.
B007R0Y7VO|4.0|As one who does NOT like war movies, I didn't think I would enjoy this, but it is so much more.  Really enjoyed it.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I was disappointed in the latest novel.  I am a rabid Reacher fan and I felt this was below standard for Lee Child.  Perhaps it was because there just wasn't enough of our hero in the story.  Reacher MUST be the driving force in every plot.  *sigh* maybe the next book.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|For the most part, I totally agree with her, and it's REALLY good to see a modern young woman pick up the gauntlet of feminism.  It's funny, entertaining, and makes a lot of really good points.  However, as often happens with feminism, the TRUE GOLD / GOAL is missed.  A true feminist is not interested in being more like the men, rather a true feminist appreciates the beauty that makes the feminine principal and feminine attributes of equal value to the masculine attributes and principles.  For example, it is one step forward to say that it should be just as acceptable for women to behave like men who can lay whatever they want whenever they want without repercussion, as men do, but it is another step forward entirely to say that a woman (or man) who treats her (or his) body with respect and only grants access to it to those who are worthy, is the higher value.  True feminism says that the feminine principle of demanding a higher standard for access is the principle of higher value, and that sleeping around (held as a higher value by men when achieved by men - generally speaking) is actually the lower value.  (I'm no writer, but I hope I have made the point clear.)
B005E7AOHI|5.0|I love this album!  It gets stuck in my head for days and I can listen to the entire album beginning to end and turn around and hit play AGAIN, and again.
B004U8VWIM|5.0|...and I rarely watch a movie more than once.  Would watch it again if a friend hadn't seen it yet.
B00631VJIC|5.0|This CD is one of my favorite CD's I play it almost every day and if you are a sons of anarchy fan then this is your ticket.  Katie sagal is fantasic in this CD![[ASIN:B00631VJIC Songs of Anarchy: Music from Sons of Anarchy Season 1-4]]
B009LZEZSI|4.0|Didn't see this coming...Everyone?  Do long distance relationships never work? Every couple had their moment in the spotlight. Fun to see all the flashbacks.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I found the dialogue a bit over the top--for me it was too glib to fit the situation. Instead of trying to be too clever, DeMille would have been better served to concentrate on building suspense. Not his best effort.
B0043URV5U|5.0|I love this Greatest hits CD.....it has most of the songs I like in fact a few that weren't played on the radio....Love \\"Turn the Page\\" Beautiful Loser and Travelin Man are the Best tho .....Loved Bob Seger music when I was coming up in the 80's along with other artist ....this CD is a must have for Seger lovers of all ages
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Quite interesting puzzles. The beginning puzzles are definitely easy, however all can present a challenge. Would like to see a hint on the hard levels. Definitely worth playing for hours on end.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Really good read. Bought for daughter but also ended up reading it for myself. Can not wait to read the next two
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Cassandra Clare is a VERY EXCELLENT writer. Just when you think she can't twist a good plot out, she amazes you with HOW WELL she does it!
0756666937|5.0|I bought The Lego Book for my 9 year old grandson.  Before giving it away I had my oldest grandson and two college buddies visiting.  They spent so much time going through the book remembering what Lego sets they remembered from their youth.  It was such a treat to see the lifelong love of Legos!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|No surprise, Grisham has done it again. My kindle said I was 90% done with this book, and I still wasn't sure who was working with who, who was telling the truth, and what would happen. I couldn't put it down!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun but it takes a long time to get enough points to open new games but I refuse to buy so I just work my way through slowly but surely.
0399157565|1.0|SCARPETTA FELL QUITE A WHILE AGO. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE OLD DOC?????? NOW WE HAVE A HEAD CASE WITH EVERY NEW BOOK AND IT IS SCARPETTA WITH HER HEAD IN THE CASE. A CASE OF DUH!!!!!!! GIVE BACK THE ORIGINAL SCARPETTA WHERE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO READ THIRD PERSON. SHE DOES THIS, HE DOES THAT. SCARPETTA FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS AND GOES BOOM. BINKY OR BRINKLEY. WHAT IS HER HUSBAND'S NAME. FALLS DOWN AFTER HER AND LANDS WITH HIS HEAD IN THE SAME CASE WITH HER. MOI
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Can't wait for the last book, was a great follow up to the first book.  Would recommend if you enjoyed fifty shades of grey
B008KYOCA2|3.0|I love it on my Android phone. I've had it on several phones thru Google. I got this version from Amazon to be able to see my calendar on my laptop. I've been trying to get it to sync with the cloud and show up on my laptop it won't work. Company hasn't helped much on this subject. They do respond well to icon requests and such. If you want it on your phone it's wonderful.
B0090SVDO0|5.0|This CD should go onto the short list of essential Doors live releases (others are [[ASIN:B00122LZ6I Live In Detroit]], [[ASIN:B0014ESXL4 Live In Pittsburgh 1970]] and [[ASIN:B0001XALH8 Live at the Aquarius Theatre: The Second Performance]]). Has any other rock band so effectively used the full range of dynamics from near silence to ecstatic noise? Has any other band used the building and release of musical tension so well? Has any guitarist besides Robbie Krieger varied his approach as much and given each song, each fill, what it needs with such precision and aural delight for the listener? Rhetorical questions my friends, and only part of what you'll hear on this CD. I've been buying and listening to Jimi Hendrix concerts from the same years the Doors were active, and - with all due respect - I prefer the Doors. As good as Hendrix's sidemen were, it was Hendrix and his band, while the Doors is a meeting and collaboration of four highly talented and skillful musicians. Layers of craft and creativity come from four different directions and unite in a glorious whole.
B005QBKXSC|5.0|I absolutely love Daughtry - ever since he was on American Idol!<br /><br />This CD is really good.<br /><br />Have seen him in concert - he is the best!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a nurse I have had the opportunity to witness first hand accounts from patients who experienced NDEs.  However, I have never had them so vividly explained as Dr. Alexander does in this book.  A must read for those who just aren't quite sure there is another side!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey is back in a big way with this novel.  DeMille continues his mastery in giving you an exciting story.  He is able to pull his John Corey stories together to continue his books with excitement in each pasge.  My only problem is waiting for the next John Corey novel.
B009DH379C|5.0|I owned this on VHS and LD back in the day... so I was curious as to how it would transfer to BR... and also the 16x9 crop as both previous editions were 4x3.<br />RESULTS?  it LOOKS GREAT!<br />Of course reading the liner notes in the lovely booklet enclosed reveal that this show was indeed filmed by Hungary's leading cinematographer/director who used every 35mm camera in the country and shot it on FILM not video.<br />As they say in the notes \\"This is the last complete concert shot entirely on film. So junk that old laserdisc, throw the VHS in the bin and burn the bootleg.<br /><br />HIGHLY Recommended!<br /><br />PS...the repurposed nearly half hour documentary is fun and I particularly enjoy the large interview chunks with the retired John Deacon.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I really enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's first books with Kay Scarpetta.  The past few books however have seemed to have lost the edge in her stories.  I cannot put my finger on it but the books are becoming less exciting to read.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|5stars I play this every day. !  thank you Team lava for all the. great games!  I hope there is more games coming
B00914JWSW|2.0|I'm a real Barbra fan & just saw her in Chicago this year (2012) & I was so happy that her concert didn't focus on these songs.  I bought the CD after listening to the preview song, \\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\\" which I loved.  Actually, I love less than 1/2 the songs.  Those that I did enjoy were \\"Didn't We,\\" \\"Willow Weep for Me,\\" \\"Mother & Child,\\" \\"If It's Meant to Be\\" aside from \\"Rain Today.\\" I listened to this CD over & over hoping to change how I felt about the album but it didn't get any better for me.  Just not my favorite.
B001H1SW4M|5.0|Not only does this movie scare the hell out of ya it mind crushes u too!!! I don't care for the othe saw movies but this one will be a true classic
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because every song is so catchy and original and goes so hard! You will not be one bit upset with this album!
B00800WIK2|5.0|I Collect arcade memorabilia, and the look and feel of this little arcade unit is pretty cool.  It creates a realistic arcade experience. There is really only 3 games created for it thus far, but the are the Space Invaders, Asteroids, and Pong games. I did discover the Arcadie MAME mode that is really sweet BUT again you must jailbreak your phone to use. I like the sound effects and fun factor of the games. I'm a happy camper.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Anyone familiar with Nelson DeMille's writing knows...there's a metered tempo to his style, his irreverent and cynical attitude, and his utter brilliance with creating characters. I honestly thought Panther was going to be an \\"easy knock-off\\" of John Corey's \\"Lion\\" adventure; a strategy many authors are capitalizing on...simply piggy-backing one story on the success of another. But as all thing in the confusing Middle East, this story line has a life entirely of it's own. Great character development, interestingly factual relationships between various intel and diplomatic services, the cross pollination of \\"need to know\\" information passing between the players lets the reader know...he or she is eavesdropping on \\"classified\\" information. This is another triumph for DeMille, and a keepsake for the reader.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Mr. DeMille was not up to his best with the Panther.  The premise and plot had great possibilities, but the execution was weak.  His hero Corey cracked too many jokes for such a serious subject.  This just was not what I expected.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Lots of fun. Love being able to use my own pics for background and deck of cards. I would recommend if there were fewer ads and I didn't get so many hands dealt where I can't make a single move.
B003B02OQ4|4.0|I have enjoyed all of John Grisham's books.  I prefer A Time to Kill and The Firm, this is still fun with great characters and a fast moving story!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have 13000 plus coins. I've used all my dollars! What does all XPs do?  Almost level 200. Have upgraded!  Looking forward to more. I did not buy one coin or $. Just be patient ...
1419701533|5.0|My 6th grader had not really taken to reading until he started reading these books.  He has read most of the Diary of Wimpy Kid and loves them.  I was thrilled to find a set of five books!  He finished them in a week!  So glad that he found them.  I find him reading all the time now instead of watching t.v. or playing video games!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Depp fans will get a kick out of it, plus its entertainment value. I do hope they follow up, as there are some things left hanging and wish they would've touched more on...<br /><br />Good collaboration (like always) between Depp and Burton.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|enjoyable book.  Is it farfetched?  Unfortunately not. I can see this as a movie.<br />Grisham just does not disappoint, even though this is not a highly intellectual read, it does hold interest.
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't put it down, the books get better and better as you read through the trilogy so don't just read the first one!!
B004H51706|5.0|I like this toy very very much... may be even more than my son does. This is an excellent miniature version of the iconic Land Rover Defender SUV. This is made entirely of plastic. The attention to detail is impressive. Both the driver and passenger doors open as well as the back door! The hood pops up and there is even a hood stand!! Both front wheel are connected to the steering wheel such that if you rotate the steering in any direction, the front wheels actually turn! But that is not the most amazing thing in this mini Land Rover. The best feature of this replica is the independent wheel suspension for all 4 wheels. If you drive this over a toy soldier for example, you will notice that the wheel directly over the soldier lifts slightly up to accommodate the soldier while all the other 3 wheels are still maintaining contact with the ground. This is what Land Rovers are famous for and what all the real off-road capable vehicles display. I was just amazed to find that they would put this much amount of work inside a toy at this price range. Bruder totally rocks!<br /><br />For the record, I do not approve of driving toy Land Rovers over toy soldiers.
1609611543|2.0|When I first read this book on July 22, 2012, I was troubled about the modifications in wheat, enough that I decided to go three months without eating any of it.<br />Because the author advocates a basic low-carb diet I began researching that, too.  All the info was new and made my head spin.  However, I began eating between 30-70 g of net carbs per day.  I easily lost about seven pounds but had several RED flags.  First, oily, runny poo, which never really firmed up.  Dr, Oz has showed me what healthy poo looks like.  I know something was out of kilter!  Secondly, horribly painful leg cramps.  Finally, reading through a cancer-prevention book taught me that most of the foods I was enjoying (eggs, dairy, meat) are highly acidic, which is a great place for cancer to grow.<br />(I also could not get below 159 pounds.  I am a 5. 10 1/2&#34; female.  I think it was because much of the food that I was eating was low carb but high calorie )<br />I went back to the drawing board and began to exercise harder.  However, looking back over my life, I had to admit that exercising longer and harder, although it got me stronger, never really helped me lose weight.  So I kept searching for an answer for me.<br />I finally found a book that has helped me the most, Lose Weight Without Dieting, by JJ Smith.  She is sensible and has a vast knowledge of nutrition and what it does in the body.  I have been doing her program for two weeks and have easily and effortlessly lost six pounds.<br />She advocates eating clean, organic fruits and veggies, lean proteins, healthy fats.<br />I have also been studying soy and corn products.  The genetic modification that goes on in America is shameful.  That information has made me feel like it is safer to eat wheat!
B00992CF6W|4.0|plz plz plz make a free version of this becouse my family is poor and It took me 2 years just to get 7 dollar for this app plz plz plz make a free version :(
1469220660|5.0|I was looking for a book simmilar to 50 shades of gray only better written and with more depth. I've read a few but this one had me glued to my kinde from the first page I read. You have to read this book. The story keeps you gasping for air. My heart kept racing the entire time and I found my self holding my breath at times. I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out. I've read a few books in the same ganra and have not found an equal so far.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is better than angry birds it is so fun this is really fun to play on the kindle fire:)
B000XR4OC0|4.0|This is my third pair of TOMS and I love this brand!!! I bought it in black and if looks and feels pretty good so far (just slipped my foot in)! I'm very sad about the price though because although this price is amazing compared to what I would get it for at the mall, an hour after I bought these, the price dropped by about $7! Please wait a few days before you buy this shoppers!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Once again John Grisham has proved himself to be a master storyteller.  The book is filled with unexpected twists and turns and, like all of Grisham's works, is an enjoyable read.  I could not put the book down.  Don't expect this to be anything like his previous books.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is an addicting game. Very fun for the entire family. It is balanced very well. Not to hard but not easy either.
B0018QCXGY|4.0|4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />Ok, I know, people are getting tired of the mockumentry hand shaken, but not stirred films, but I can't resist a giant monster movie, especially one as good as this!<br /><br />A giant monster with deadly offspring attacks New York City. We don't know where it came from, what it is, other than it can topple over 50 story buildings & is multiplying quickly with fast moving/growing offspring whose bites bring on a deadly infection to whomever is bitten. It is impervious to non-nuclear military attacks, & is wreaking havoc on to the city.<br /><br />Sounds like your typical Japanese giant monster film, right? Yes, if that was what all this film was about, but it isn't. That's where the handheld POV camera comes in & tells the story of mass hysteria, & the horror of an unknown terror. Of how a group of young New Yorkers try to survive the onslaught of not just the monster, but the military trying to destroy the monster, & a city collapsing around them. It delves into these characters psyches as they confront certain death, time & time again. How they band together for the good of all & the good of one. There is no fairy tale endings here to make the audience feel better. There is no sparing of heart rendering scenes. This is mayhem, wicked, brutal, & heart breaking. This is what it would be like if this scenario was to ever happen. Real people with deep emotions & attachments losing their loved ones & their lives.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" is a clever heart pulsing thrill ride. It smartly never lets you get to many good glimpses of the monster. Most of the time a shot of the head, the body, the extremities, which make the beast all the more threatening.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" knows how to get your attention! A particularly great scene is one of the head of the Statue of Liberty flying of it's shoulders & landing blocks into the city, rolling to a stop in the middle of a street. A great parable to 9/11. A great parable of pure unadulterated horror of something so incomprehensible happening, that it overwhelms the logical mind. A true demonstration of just how naked & vulnerable we truly are as a species, whether it be against our own kind, or nature.<br /><br />Yes, \\"Cloverfield\\" is an allegory to a path that many fear the most & expect the least. A path that has been traveled down time & time again in the real world, but we never would think it would happen to us, until it does.unadulterated horror of something so incomprehensible happening, that it overwhelms the logical mind.

B009CPES4I|4.0|This was a sweet and realistic story about aging and what life is about once raising children and career focus are out of the forefront.  Enjoyed the idea of their adventure in India.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app really helps because I know how long I can procrastinate and be lazy!! I love it! it really helps every single day.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|He said this book was not researched like many of his others. I enjoyed the story that his imagination crafted.  Reminded me of The Partner which I found to be one of his best works. Highly recommend to his fans.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|First off, its totaly disjointed and hard to follow.<br />The whole book is about one guy telling everyone how bad ass he is. Its very very off putting to constanly read about how great he is at everything and only he can get the job done. How much of this story is true, i have no idea, but his constant me me me rants and look how good iam left me wondering thats for sure.<br />I can honestly say, the only reason i completed reading the book was for the sheer comedy value at reaing someones over inflated account of them selves.<br />There are far far better reads out there by former seals.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Outstanding! This book kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole thing.  A week later I am still thinking about the ending.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It's a trash book, not worthy to read. Poorly written, primitive story. I'm surprised book got so far with amount of readers. Proves the point that intellectual level of readers is as low as quality of book.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Nothing particularly fancy... It does what I need when I need it. Just a nice functional calculator.  It has an upgrade offer for $.99 with no indication of what is included in the upgrade other than removal of the the ads banner.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I so enjoy this character, both flaws and strengths! Would love to know him. It makes me wonder if such a person exists.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is full of excitement for all ages.  The main characters are brother and sister, but were separated at birth.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very engaging characters, a somewhat dark but possible future is explored very well. It was scary, suspenseful and at times very frustrating.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|May I read the book before I rate it? Can't give you eleven more words until I read it through.  Thank you.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Although the songs are very similar, no one can sing with the same empathy or feeling as THE Barbra. There is no other way to describe her singing. The Bergmans were very talented writers.
B00005JLET|5.0|The movie was everything I remembered, always a fun watch.  The movie and case looked good and played well, nothing to complain about!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a great movie! I read the series and I couldn't wait till the movie came out. Needless to say, I watched it at the movies as soon as it came out. I rarely watch movies again and again but this one was the exception. I'm glad this one is on blu-ray. I am glad I got it, and I would recommend it to anyone that had become infatuated by the story.
B009JNXK88|5.0|I love the way that it makes you want to take time and skill to complete each level. I experienced a game breaking bug, however. All of my progress resets whenever I open the app. Is there a save button I am missing?
B0091REZMW|3.0|love the game but slow going because u have to wait long time for energy refill don't like having to pay for energy or diamonds
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a great story and now I want to read more from this author. I wish it had ended a little differently but overall I loved it.
0316223239|5.0|I was afraid, given the subject, that this book would be a downer. That couldn't have been farther from the truth.  Even though there were times that it was emotionally difficult, the over all story was an expression of hope and love, and how people can persevere in extreme situations.  I couldn't put it down!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use Kindle everyday. I love reading and it is so simple to use. It is way better to have this app on my phone than to actually the Kindle tablet because of its portability.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Corey took care of the Lion and now he is after the Panther. DeMille continues to pour out top notch books on mideast terrorists. The one negative is there is too much of John Corey's wise cracking, after a while it takes away from the story line. It would be four rated if not for this characteristic
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is a master story teller and a brilliant novelist and this book is just another trophy to put on his mantel.  A must read for history buffs as well.  I enjoyed it immensely!  Can't wait for the next one!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This is the first novel I have read by Gillian Flynn.  I stayed interested in the story line, but found it to be okay, not great.  I plan to try another book by this author as many people have told me how much they love her books.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I am so hooked on Reacher. I am reading 2 books a week. I will be so sorry when I am done with the series. I love that there is so much suspense and no foul language. A fast paced, action packed book can be written without being packed full of foul words. Lee Child is great. I am a fan.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Read this during the recent hurricane and I felt that I was constantly traveling between two worlds. the vivid descriptions of the times were so real it was as though you were there. Would highly recommend this book to anybody who wants or needs an escape.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK! After reading all the great reviews, I decided to give it a try. I am a die hard romantic. I loved this book so much. Yes, it can be a bit much at times. But, that's what love is about. Love is not perfect. This wasn't your typical love story; where there is only one conflict and they live happily ever after. This shows the darker side of love. Please don't let the negative comments stop you from reading this book. If you are a hardcore romance book reader like I am, give this book a shot.<br /><br />Side Note : I can't wait for Walking Disaster -- Travis' side of things! I don't know how I will wait until April !
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book was well thought through and executed. Worth reading again.<br />Thank you Mrs Collins for writing it!<br />Commit wait for the next one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game super fun. the problem for me this that I don't have a facebook account so a lot of the goals I cant get.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put the books down until all three books were read. Each book was better the the one before it. The third book was the best!
1449410243|3.0|This book is a stretch and I think the author runs the subject into the proverbial ground.  It was more worthy of being<br />a very short essay rather than being expanded into a book - the material eventually is so weak it isn't funny anymore.<br />However, I like his books, and think he has an interesting take on life and a humorous way of expressing himself in general,<br />so I figure sooner or later his reach will exceed his grasp.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|[[ASIN:B008OGJXJ6 Tempest (Deluxe Limited Edition)]][[ASIN:B008OGJXJ6 Tempest (Deluxe Limited Edition)]] Dylan is one of a very few who have kept the music fresh over such a prolonged  stretch.  While there may be a tune I did not care for as much as some others, this is not bad considering the time span.  Considered by many to be the poet Lauraete of the generation, he has proven himself once more.[[ASIN:B008OGJXJ6 Tempest (Deluxe Limited Edition)]]  In the least it could be said that Dylan wrote the soundtrack of our lives.  We followed him through the Civil Rights Movement, protesting war in general, through a period where he pronounced his religious feelings and produced a couple of the best gospel pieces in history...he has been there through it all, never actually saying \\"do as I do.\\" but showing us that the world is a huge place and there are many things to explore.  Whether we agreed or not, Dylan was a beacon, shining light into the darkest corners of men's souls.  I may not have always agreed but he was an ever present companion, teacher and mentor.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love all of G5e's games that I have played. They make decent quality games, and they hold my interest for longer then 2 minutes. VC playground is fun and I like being able to follow quest line's. Slow at first but picks up. Worth the download.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Great movie, big fan and if you like special features this movie gives some behind the scene insight to why they did something's and why they did not do others. Well worth the wait and the price!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This kept me reading on and on. I wanted to read my book right away when I got home from work it was so good!
B006G2124E|5.0|One of the best books I have read recently. Shared by reading to my husband during a vacation trip. Excellent. Then watched movie. Another triumph.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|This ball is amazingly fun and addicting. I got this last winter or spring, and I stayed up a whole night to solve it. Sad to say, I was able to finish all 128 or so puzzles by one day. Nonetheless, it was fun and worth the money. I still play it occasionally now, and it is still as challenging as that first day.<br /><br />These kind of products is really good for kids and adults who wants to practice precision and fine motor skills. So I recommend it to anyone who might be looking into being a surgeon or into jobs where fine motor moment, hand-eye coordination is involved. This is also good for building up spatial recognition as well.<br /><br />My only pet peeves that knocked off a star is that the toy is made out of plastic, and the ball gets scratched and oiled up pretty quickly making it extremely unattractive and dirty. However, you can't really ask for much from a 19-21$ toy.

B009329ZF2|4.0|Battleship starts out slowly with some predictable character study moments, setting the stage for later heroics.  As hero Stone Hopper (Taylor Kitsch - John Carter) and his naval buddies do their duty for country and for Earth against mysterious aliens, the action builds with the technology of both sides providing spectacular effects.  The film makers did a decent job of including the human elements of heroism, duty, humanity, and humility, as the characters fight the aliens in bigger and bigger battles.  When the battleship Missouri is brought into the conflict, you can't help but feel proud that a few of these awe-inspiring ships still exist.  You always know the good guy humans will win, but seeing how is a fun voyage with great special effects, reasonable dialog and characters, and final scenes that make viewers feel the gratitude that all our military heros deserve.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you hate this I hate you this game RULES ive never played the Pc version well... like I played it 2 times but THIS is AWESOME! there is no story but its spool cool. if you have friends over you can play with them
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not impressed by many series, but this one, like \\"Lost\\", had me hooked from day 1.  Not just me, but our entire family.  Even though I've always said 'I don't like gory movies', I loved this from the beginning.  For one, it's not real....duh.  For another, there is no reason to feel bad when a zombie is \\"killed\\", because after all, they're DEAD already!  No conflict of human emotion there (unless you lived on the farm before the 'enlightenment').  IF you are one of the unlucky ones who has never seen the show - DO NOT start in the middle.  You HAVE to start from the beginning.  Granted, the first show of the series is a bit of a slow start, so don't give up on it - believe me, it improves greatly.  This coming from a 57 year old mom who NEVER puts herself out to watch stuff like this on a normal daily basis.  It's ageless - all ages like it.  It's all about that good old human instinct of trying to survive in adverse situations - much like some sad Republicans are going to have to try to do after yesterday's election.  The world is out of control, and all you can do is work to control your little part of it.  Give \\"Walking Dead\\" a try if you haven't already.  You won't be disappointed, and it'll only help to improve your survival skills for when the Zombie Apocalypse comes!  ;-)
B007WULJ5G|5.0|Okay let me start by saying that I have seen many horror films(in fact I have over 1,500 of them in my collection), however, nothing I have ever seen compares to A Serbian Film in any way, shape or form. Everyone who I have ever talked to who has viewed this film has had different reactions to it. Most reactions I've encountered were either disgust or love toward the film. Before watching the film I decided not to read any specifics about it, and boy did it pay off!! Unlike The Vomit Gore Trilogy, and the August Underground trilogy which were all made to look grainy which automatically puts your guards up to prepare to watch extreme gore, A Serbian Film has AMAZING cinematography which gives the audience a fake sense of comfort, causing guards to be dropped and ultimately not preparing people for the subjects/images they are about to see. Simply brilliant! While the director explains that this film symbolizes the lack of control Serbian citizens have because of Serbian Govenment, some people feel as though the director only made that statement to get away with putting over the top scenes in the movie. Regardless of the reasonings the director had, the fact remains that love it or hate it the images from this film are not likely to get erased from your head. I found myself very sympathetic and connected to the main character Milos (a broke ex porn star, who agrees to go out of retirement for one final film for the sake of his own family's financial well being, little does he know what's really in store for him). Aside from feeling a connection to the main character (showing a well written story and amazing acting), I also praise the film due to the fact that while there are some graphic scenes, many times it is what's left out to a persons imagination which presents true horror, it shows how dark a human mind can visualize things when presented with certain subject matters in the right way. This film DEMANDS attention, and it certainly took hold of mine from the opening scene, and continued on until the final credits!! 5/5 stars. Highly recommended to those who are fans of extreme films.

B009ESIGHI|1.0|I must join the clamour and boycott this incomplete BD version of the movie. I'd love to see the FULL version of the movie in Hi-Def but Disney is not making that possible.<br /><br />I love this movie. I bought the VHS version only 3 years ago and it is a delight. The song \\"When love is gone\\" is the soul of the movie. Without this song Scrooge's story of how he falls into despair and loneliness is incomplete and therefore his redemption is hollow.<br /><br />I will be showing my 16 month old daughter the VHS version when she is old enough. I would have loved to have been able to show her the full version in Hi-Def but Disney has not made that possible for the movie's many fans.<br /><br />Pity. Disney, you still have time to do the right thing. Art and economics can co-exist!
0062073486|4.0|There is a reason that this is the best selling mystery novel of all time. And that reason is that it will successfully fool all but the most vigilant of readers. The premise is simple enough - ten strangers are trapped on an island and one of them is a murderer who picks them off one by one. A major strength of this novel is that the protagonists share a curious trait with the reader - they seem to be pulled into a more passive role and just watch with horror as their inescapable destiny approaches. What seems to be lacking in the book is character development. Because the motivations of the characters must largely remain secret, the narration does not probe too deeply into the thoughts and feelings of this lot. This may leave the reader wanting for the author to more fully explore the hysterics and the paranoia that may develop in this kind of situation. There is little richness to the writing, but the plot is propelled well by quick and natural dialogue, which also forms the majority of the insight that the reader gets into the victims. Overall, the plot and the conclusion are quite fantastical, though do not at all feel contrived, and so this is an enjoyable read that will leave you guessing until the very end.

B0030DBGXY|5.0|You can't compromise on survival gear quality, so almost 20 years ago, I invested in a Cold Steel SRK. If I could only have one survival knife, which would also be used as a field dressing tool for big game and a meat cutting implement, it would be a Cold Steel SRK. Here's why.<br /><br />After my first Idaho elk hunt in 1990, I had to make some gear changes. My wood-stocked BDL 7mmRemington Magnum caliber went synthetic. I got heavier boots, warmer hunting clothes, better binoculars and a Cold Steel SRK.<br /><br />The upgrade was great: What hunter ever needs an excuse to buy new stuff? But  I got almost emotional upon replacing my Buck folding hunting knife. I bought the Buck new for $25 on August 31, 1976 at the Ace Hardware Store in Lovell, Wyoming, and the Buck and I have bonded.<br /><br />The Buck was in my pack when I hiked the John Muir Trail in California; the southern loop of Yellowstone, Death Valley and on several other long hikes in various western mountain ranges. It rode on my hip on my  Mississippi River canoe trip from Minnesota to Louisiana, and also went on canoe trips through the Big Black and Okefenokee Swamps.  The Buck has been used to clean hundreds of fish, squirrels and rabbits; cut summer sausage and spread gallons of peanut butter on crackers and bread. I used it to gut and skin my first deer.<br /><br />But after my first backpack elk hunt, I realized that a different survival-style knife was needed. Weight is an issue, and there is only room to carry minimal equipment into the backcountry. Any knife chosen would have to do everything, so it had to be virtually indestructible.<br /><br />This ruled out folders. Any folder's weak point is the hinge. Break that, and you end up with two pieces. And, a hinge attracts hair, dirt and other stuff that will eventually gum it up.<br /><br />Then,  I also wanted a longer,  thicker blade for gutting and quartering a  large animal. While there are folks who regularly take care of their hunting needs with a jack knife, I prefer a four to six-inch-long blade.<br /><br />My backcountry knife also needed a non-slip handle. Inevitably, the knife gets covered with blood and body fluids during a gutting operation and a slippery handle is dangerous.<br /><br />And I don't like guthooks. In my opinion, the hook is a gimmick and only good for a couple of cuts, such as the initial incision to open up the body cavity. Otherwise, the guthook dulls easily,  looks terrible on a knife blade, can hook on the sheath or your clothing and serves no other purpose.<br /><br />So I thought long and hard about the Buck's successor before deciding on a SRK. The initials stand for \\"Search and Rescue Knife,\\" but I bought it because of  the design, the composition of the handle and the reported durability.<br /><br />My SRK's high carbon steel blade is 3/16″ thick and 6″ long; the Kraton handle is 4-3/4 inches long and  overall length is 10-3/4 inches. My SRK, without sheath, weighs eight ounces, and 10.5 with sheath wrapped in duct tape. It appears to have a full-length tang, and the sheath was reasonably good nylon.<br /><br />The knife came out of its box shaving-sharp, and the steel holds an edge very well. The blade also comes with a black finish I don't like. My first action was to take the knife to a cutlery store and have all that finish removed. There's never been a problem with rust.<br /><br />My SRK is used for everything, because it holds an edge and handles well. Over the course of its career, the knife has been carried hundreds of miles on backpacking and hunting trips. It has been used to whittle wiener sticks, been battoned through many pieces of firewood, and has been pounded through a deer's pelvis with a rock during butchering.  It is the knife I use for beheading fish. Several scouts have learned safe knife handling, using the SRK, around campfires at Boy Scout campouts.<br /><br />For what I need, specifically, a survival tool that can double as a backcountrybig game hunting knife, the SRK is perfect. My SRK  has field dressed well over 50 deer and been used on several elk. In one instance, the knife field dressed and quartered three deer without it needing sharpening. The handle never gets too slick to hold safely, no matter how messy the field dressing job gets.<br /><br />The knife's performance is so impressive that two of my elk-hunter friends also bought SRKs. Two years ago, I bought a SRK for a hunting buddy who refused to accept my fair share of the gas money on a hunting trip.<br /><br />But there are some other tasks where the SRK doesn't particularly shine. It isn't a particularly good camp knife, since the thick blade doesn't work all that well for slicing tomatoes, potatoes, or summer sausage. It's clumsy for peeling potatoes. But that's why I also, weight permitting, carry some form of Mora knife.<br /><br />The clip point design works well for gutting and most field dressing chores, but the SRK  is not the best skinner. (A Forshner five-inch Lamb Skinner is!) And there are better knifes for meat cutting. Forget about filleting fish: the knife is just too big and inflexible.<br /><br />Other than a few minor cosmetic tweaks, my SRK has worked  just fine. It went along on my October, 2010 elk hunt, even though I was finishing  the final field testing of two other knives: a Gerber Gator 46904 Fine Edge and a Cold Steel Master Hunter. The newbies would have done most of the work if I had killed an elk. But the SRK was at hand, if these other knives had not worked as expected. As far as the SRK is concerned, there is no replacement  in sight!<br />(Leon Pantenburg is the author of SurvivalCommonSense.com, a practical guide to urban and wilderness survival.)big game hunting knife, the SRK is perfect.

B0000CDJPQ|4.0|A Mac user for several years I've collected several FireWire devices and cables. Through those years the ports have changed: 400 was prevalent, now 800 is all that's left. Adapters like this one are perfect for repurposing the connectors. Originally gotten for an older iPod which still supports FireWire. Battery shot, I couldn't add any extra media to it, needed FireWire to power it while syncing. My current Mac only has 800 connectors which made my cable useless. This adapter was perfect. I also find it useful with 400-to-400 cables for external drives when using with newer connectors.<br /><br />Without such an adapter, legacy devices and cables  would be inaccessible, unusable. While it only permits 400 Mb/s throughput, it at least allows connection. Tight fit in ports, it's a great solution at a better price than on most sites.

B000PAAJYW|1.0|I can't say much about this whole movie as I turned it off after around 30 minutes.  After an almost nonstop onslaught(well, it sure seemed like it) of the F word and really coarse and vile language from Mr. Cruise's first convention I had had just about enough.  The opening song was alright but it seemed to go on forever and did somewhat drown out the beginning dialogue.  I said to myself that if this is the pattern for the next 3 hours than I'd rather watch  something else.  So I turned on the dvd player and watched more of the 80's Hunter show.  I don't get the hollywood frenzy on movies like these?  I had heard about Tom Cruise's performance over the years but realized it was so talked about because it was way over the top!  Now I know better....  I hope!  I don't recommend this movie to anyone who does not care for really course language and meandering plot....
B007THA4FI|3.0|I found this book hard to get into and once there I didn't like the tone of the book. I found it to be somewhat \\"reality show\\" based with bickering husbands and wives and the foulness of the teenagers was actually appalling. Don't misunderstand, I realize her book is written in an updated societal way. However, I don't generally read books like those, regardless of who the author is. I read it to the end, hoping for at least a better ending but I felt I was left hanging, not wanting more, but glad it was over.

B009A9EPLM|5.0|In the annals of American political history, virtually no-one is as universally admired, revered and respected as Abraham Lincoln. Born into relative poverty in Kentucky in 1809, Lincoln rose from being a simple country lawyer to being elected the 16th President of the United States in 1860. During the course of his presidency Lincoln essentially re-defined the United States as we know it today, successfully defeating the Confederacy in the four-year Civil War, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation that essentially ended slavery in the country, and delivering the Gettysburg Address, one of the most famous political speeches of all time. He was re-elected in 1864 but, as we all know, was assassinated by actor John Wilkes Booth while watching a play in a Washington DC theatre in April 1865, before he could fully establish his second term. There have been many films over the years featuring Lincoln as a central figure, but director Steven Spielberg¡¯s film ¨C simply titled ¡°Lincoln¡± ¨C is a straightforward biopic of the man¡¯s life and achievements. The film stars Daniel Day Lewis in the eponymous role, and features a stellar supporting cast including Sally Field as Lincoln¡¯s wife Mary Todd, Tommy Lee Jones as republican leader Thaddeus Stevens, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Lincoln¡¯s son Robert, David Strathairn as secretary of state William Seward, and Jackie Earle Haley, James Spader, John Hawkes, Jared Harris and Hal Holbrook in smaller roles.<br /><br />Of course, where Spielberg goes, so too goes John Williams. Lincoln is their 26th collaboration as director and composer, a relationship that extends all the way back to The Sugarland Express in 1974, and encompasses some of the greatest film music ever written, from Jaws to Raiders of the Lost Ark, to E.T., Jurassic Park, Schindler¡¯s List and more. With the possible exception of Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann, theirs is by far the most creatively successful director-composer relationship in the history of cinema. At the time of writing, Spielberg has no directorial features planned until 2014, and without wanting to sound morbid, it¡¯s possible that Lincoln may be the now-80-year-old Williams¡¯s last significant cinematic work. It¡¯s just as well that the score is a classic Williams work of beauty, elegance and restraint, a tasteful but emotionally appropriate musical tribute to one of America¡¯s greatest ever leaders.<br /><br />If you boil it down to its nuts and bolts, Lincoln is a combination of the restrained patriotism of Saving Private Ryan, the emotional thematic core of War Horse, and the harmonic language and chord structure of The Patriot, filtered through the Americana sensibilities of Aaron Copland. It even goes so far as to have brief moments for period-specific instrumentation with fiddle solos and fife-and-drum Civil War marching songs, while referencing mid-19th century music from the Lutheran hymnbook which Williams researched in order to find inspiration for his thematic ideas. The vast majority of the score is written for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, and considering that they are not a traditional film score recording orchestra, they do a marvelous job capturing the expressiveness and nuance in Williams¡¯s writing. The main theme, which featured prominently in the full trailer, is a warm and inviting piece which gradually swells to encompass the entire orchestra. It¡¯s classic Williams; noble, dignified, emotionally appropriate, musically interesting, and with the beautiful harmonies that have been the hallmark of his career. Its performance in the opening ¡°The People¡¯s House¡± moves effortlessly from oboe to strings to horns in succession, illustrating the theme¡¯s adaptability to different settings, and setting up the score perfectly.<br /><br />The underscore, when not dominated by the main theme, tends to be a little more restrained, presenting dramatic textures that highlight specific instrumental colors rather than a web of recurring thematic ideas, although a series of sub-themes do exist ¨C in fact, there are five of them, each representing a specific ideal, location, or concept from Lincoln¡¯s life. It¡¯s not as aimless as the presidential music Williams wrote for John Adams in Amistad, or as understated as the majority of Saving Private Ryan, but instead presents a series of cues which are tonally pleasant, instrumentally interesting, and have a richness which drives the score onward, echoing Lincoln¡¯s determination and sense of destiny. Cues such as ¡°The Purpose of the Amendment¡±, ¡°The American Process¡±, ¡°With Malice Toward None¡± and ¡°Equality Under the Law¡± have a regal sense of righteous resolve, conveyed through slightly more bass-heavy performances led by cellos and horns, noble trumpet refrains, and which are connected by variations on a theme which seems to signify the endless inner machinations of government, and Lincoln¡¯s valiant attempts to reform it.<br /><br />Another theme, first heard via Randy Kerber¡¯s expressive piano performance in ¡°The Blue and the Grey¡±, seems to act as a signifier for the horror and tragedy of the Civil War, lamenting for the men and women who died in it in the cause of freedom. It¡¯s a much more downbeat and thoughtful theme than the others, and rightly so. The theme in ¡°Father and Son¡± shares compositional ideas with the Civil War theme ¨C appropriately, as Lincoln¡¯s eldest son fought in the conflict ¨C but has a warm, steadfast quality that speaks of the respectful relationship the two shared. There are moments of darkness, too, none more so than in ¡°The Southern Delegation and the Dream¡±, which is about as dissonant as the score ever gets.<br /><br />The time-specific pieces include ¡°Getting Out the Vote¡± and ¡°The Race to the House¡±, where more rhythmic ideas take over, and the score becomes quite jaunty, accompanying the President onhis adventures across the United States seeking votes with country fiddles, tapped percussion (including spoons!), old-fashioned banjos, and almost comedic-sounding oompah brasses. In ¡°Call to Muster and Battle Cry of Freedom¡± Williams lets loose with the all the fifes and drums he can gather, before moving into a choral performance of George Root¡¯s famous Civil War anthem, which became Lincoln¡¯s personal song during his 1864 re-election campaign against George McClellan.<br /><br />¡°Freedom¡¯s Call¡± features a standout solo violin performance by Robert Chen that gradually swells into a resounding rallying cry for the American people, and when the full throated voices of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Chorus kick in during ¡°Appomattox, April 9, 1865¡å, the music simply soars. The conclusive 11-minute ¡°The Peterson House and Finale¡± provides the most satisfying performances of the score¡¯s various thematic identities, giving Lincoln an appropriate send off which is both tragic in the sense that it mourns his death, but distinguished in the way it captures the spirit of the man and his achievements.<br /><br />I have heard virtually every one of Williams¡¯s scores since the mid 1960s, and his seemingly endless supply of thematic ideas, his mastery of the orchestra, and his innate ability to get to the emotional heart of any scene he scores with tasteful and appropriate music never fails to amaze me. This is the reason Williams is rightly considered to be one of the greatest film composers who ever lived. It¡¯s an absolute guarantee that Williams will receive his 48th Oscar nomination for this score next year, and with no second score to split his own vote, I wouldn¡¯t be surprised if it wins. Lincoln is a superb work, a proud and respectful musical tribute to a true American hero, and by far one of the standout works of 2012.

B007MDB548|5.0|I have always loved Tinkerbell and I think it is awesome of Disney with how they have been coming out with all these Tinkerbell-inspired movies.  \\"Secret of the Wings\\" is a a movie where Tinkerbell heads over to the winter fairy world and discovers she has a sister!  The two fairies do not exsist in each other's worlds due to one being a warm fairy and the other a cold fairy.  Tinkerbell is of course up to mischeif as she has her adventures in the winter fairy world and then brings her sister to hers, but trouble arises.  The movie is full of fun songs and wholesome lessons.  I watched this with my boys and they loved it, so it is definitely not just a girl movie.  I love the Blu-ray edition as it comes with both a Blu-ray disc, DVD, and Digital Copy, with this edition also including a Blu-ray 3D copy (unfortantely we don't have a 3D player though.)<br /><br />The story was easy to follow and I enjoyed watching it right alongside my kids.  The animation is so full of color and so well done.  I know for some Disney sequel-type movies the animation slips or is just not drawn the same, but in this movie the animation is perfect.  This is a must-have DVD for any Disney fan or Tinkerbell fan!

But I wasn't really keen to hear the same thing all over again and waited a few months before temptation got me and I purchased this one. Wow! They hit the target again. This CD makes me boogie, bounce around the room and shake some action. The beat, the grooves, the pounding drums, Dan's soulful, bluesy vocals; it all clicks. As good as the band sounds, what really impressed me are the songs on here. Some very well crafted tunes to be found. In fact, this album is oozing with them. What can I say? They surprised me again. One of the best albums of 2012.

B000LQJS4W|5.0|Occasionally I've heard the comment that a person is \\"such a Pollyanna.\\"  It was usually used as an insult or put down.  So I wanted to find out myself about the story of Pollyanna.  The book turned out to be a wonderful story of a sweet little girl who went to live with a strict aunt and all the unfolding of events in their lives.  Pollyanna actually possessed a very uplifting outlook on life, always playing the \\"glad game\\" in which she always made it a point to find something positive to be glad about in spite of sad circumstances.  She was actually a very uplifting influence on her entire town and upon her straight-laced aunt.  The moral of the story was that her loving and accepting outlook on life is what helped and improved the lives of everyone in the town.  A beautiful story with an inspiring moral.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|The special effects are the siren song that will probably lure you into watching this movie. Resist with all your might! From beginning to end, the story is so flawed and derivative that this viewer was almost laughing out loud by the time the alien baby was discovered in Elizabeth Shaw. From the strange suicide of the ancestor in the opening scene to the inexplicably malicious behavior of David, most notably toward Charlie Holloway, you may find yourself scratching your head as to why the writers chose to use highly unlikely plot devices for their characters merely to achieve equally unlikely later outcomes in an attempt to inject some excitement into an otherwise drop-dead boring story. The huge disconnect between the noble quest of the travelers and what they ultimately find robs the film of any humanity or saving grace it might have been able to muster, much less provide any satisfaction in discovering the answers the travelers seek.  Apparently our creators were so bumbling that they were unable to contain their own biological weapon long enough to use it on us.  Again, there seems to be no rhyme or reason why they would want to annihilate us.  Oh, wait, they aren't the creators after all! Don't confuse the utter lack of originality as homage to Alien or Jurassic Park. This is simply a rip-off of some of those films' more notable scenes with some obvious cheap sexual inuendo thrown in (a phallic snake stuffing itself into the mouths of its victims? Please.). It's unfortunate that Ridley Scott chose to make such a soulless film.  The only possible redeeming features are the gorgeous special effects and the easy-on-the-eyes quartet of Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Logan Marshall-Green and Charlize Theron. They're not nearly enough to save humanity from this disaster.

B009G78EE2|5.0|Every single track on this album is amazing. I saw Macklemore live in the Spring and he was amazing. Since then I've been obsessed. Thrift shop is definitely my favorite track, but so is Same Love and A-WAKE. all in all, it's very rare that you can listen to a whole album non-stop and enjoy every minute of it.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Book is good, but not quite as good as most of Grisham's books. Doesn't have the great trials, and/ or great research on a subject, that characterize most of his books. However, it does grab you by the lapels and is hard to put down.
B000TXZP0S|3.0|real crime stories can be interesting and educational, but I found this movie to be drawn out a little too much. I had no problem with the acting except that it was difficult to identify with the little bits that they portrayed. with that said, this movie was like true life - there isn't always a satisfactory ending.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|Garbage has always been one of my favorite bands but somehow I lost contact, not realizing they had issued a new album (duh!).  Getting ready to attend a live Garbage concert I figured I'd better get the latest to get my head around it in case they played some tunes from the new album.  I expected a disappointing retread, like bands do when they get together after a few years' off but instead... Wow!  Fantastic!<br /><br />NYKOP has become one of my favorite Garbage albums ever where almost all the tunes you can listen to over and over.  Oddly enough, the only one I tend to skip over is the title tune \\"Not Your Kind of People,\\" (hey... everybody has their own tastes!) but I keep listening to the others over and over.  I particularly like Automatic Systematic Habit, Big Bright World, Blood for Poppies... well, all of them!  \\"Control\\" and \\"Felt\\" particularly stand out as classic Garbage productions - massive, strong, inventive and ready to go the distance.<br /><br />The live Garbage concert (Milo Concert Hall on 2 November 2012 in Nizhny Novogorod, Russia) was absolutely phenomenal.  The group gets cranked up and absolutely rocks with massive power, virtually levitating the room.  Amazing!  Get the album and if you get a chance to see Garbage live, go for it!

I have spent 15 bucks for other adventure games that were less fun.  the only faults I can see are an inanbility to zoom (kindle). &amp; its hard to not click out of a room by accident as you explore.  also the tile puzzle needs to save your progress.  overall an impressive game. ill definitely get more from these dev<br />s

B0083P1QUM|1.0|I had high expectations for this continuation of Kay's story. To me, there was not much action or suspense. This seemed to more of a psychological profile of Marino, who has worn out his welcome as a character. He is tired and boring story wise. I wish she would kill him off. So very tedious to read about Benton and their very disfunctional marriage. Lucy has become a \\"cutout\\" as a character. I don't really understand what has gone wrong with the storyline and the characters but I suspect it is time to retire the series. Really sorry to have read this book. It was very disappointing to me as a reader. The books in this series were quite wonderful and fun to read. But now, not so much.

B0096YBEIS|5.0|Fourplay, the contemporary jazz group known for their incredibly smooth jazz, recently released their newest album, \\"Esprit De Four\\". Let me just say this: Some things only get better with time, and Fourplay appears to be in that category. The album is sizzling hot from the moment it begins until the very last note is played, and has been met with critical acclaim and garnered praise from fans as well. How do they do it? I think the proper word is SYNERGY. The four (keyboardist Bob James, bassist/vocalist Nathan East, guitarist Chuck Loeb, and drummer/percussionist Harvey Mason) are immensely talented musicians individually. However, their combined efforts are greater than the sum of their individual greatness. SYNERGY. They've got plenty of it, and there's enough on the album to satisfy the most discerning of jazz fans. Released on Heads Up International, a division of Concord Music Group, \\"Esprit De Four\\" belongs in every jazz connoisseur's collection.<br /><br />\\"Esprit De Four\\" embodies contributions from all members of the group, which for more than two decades has been making us feel the groove. \\"Esprit De Four\\" debuted at #1 on Billboard's Contemporary Jazz chart, which speaks volumes. So does the album, and listeners will love what it's saying.<br /><br />\\"December Dream\\" begins simply and then flows to a full stream and out into a ocean of music. This group simply overwhelms me with their sound. It is pure and very sophisticated as they play in a synchronized flow that is perfectly connected. It doesn't matter which of the four is taking the lead, one can count on it to be consistently outstanding. \\"December Dream: sets the stage for everything that follows on this very beautiful CD. The overall theme is mellow, however, with Fourplay, even mellow is enormous. This is an album from a very special place of creativity and distinction, and no amount of words that I write can prepare you for just how great it is. This is one of those CDs that you \\"Run, don't walk, and buy!!

B008FPZQQU|3.0|I have purchased other remixes made by Steven Wilson (King Crimson, Jethro Tull, etc.)and frankly, this job doesn't impress me at all. Disc One is a remaster already available and sounds very dull and compressed. Disc 2 is a little better not not much, probably because of limitations of the source tapes found. the DVD-A with the 5.1 mix is better, but doesn't get close to the old vinyl Cotillion LP so treasured in my youth.<br />On the other hand, the artwork is horrible, with barely readable pages and pictures that show fold lines.<br />This seems  to be a rushed job. What ultimately saves the day is the music, well composed, arranged and performed.<br />If you owns any other version, this is not deemed essential, but if you don't, this is the best way to get that first album

B009FBX5M0|2.0|It certainly doesn't happen very often these days that cinema history witnesses a true milestone, but the 50th anniversary of James Bond, celebrated by \\"Skyfall\\", is a true cornerstone in movie history. Not only did James Bond produce some of the most iconic films and images in history, but also some of the most iconic music. And while the music for a Bond film is always a major point of interest, more so than in other movies, this time it receives special attention because of the anniversary.<br /><br />The composer of choice for the 50th anniversary movie was Thomas Newman. A somewhat odd choice, given not only his resume, including not-so-Bond-like movies like American Beauty, Wall-E or The Iron Lady, but also because regular Bond composer David Arnold has proved numerous times that he could have risen to the occasion. Ultimately, Sam Mendes decided in favor of his regular collaborator and against the more likely choice David Arnold. If you expect Skyfall to have anything resembling action pieces like \\"Miami International\\" and \\"Come In, 007\\", or Barryesque pieces like Vesper's theme, you'll be sorely dissapointed.<br /><br />The principle of successful Bond music is not that difficult. John Barry himself described it best when he said \\"Subtlety is no virtue in a Bond score.\\" Practically every Bond composer in the past 50 years took this to heart, even Eric Serra. Even though his GoldenEye score was wholly inappropriate and too different for a Bond flick, he certainly didn't hold back the excitement. In this light, Newman's music was awaited with some doubts, considering that he never did anything resembling the standards that should be met in such a film.  Ever the ressurection of the series in 1995, the rule of previous films was broken that the composer of the score also writes the title song. But even though Serra and Arnold (except once) did not write them, they established their own distinguishable thematic ideas.<br /><br />Skyfall, however, must be the first score in the entire series that does not, in any shape or form, establish its own musical identity, and in a series in which the public is so interested in the music, more so that in other series still in production - and for the 50th anniversary movie on top of that - that is simply not acceptable. You could easily make a concert suite for any of the previous 22 films's themes, but you would have a hard time with Skyfall, since there is literally no cue on this album that would identify this film as \\"Skyfall\\". It's either pure electronics with minimal orchestra, or minimal electronics with minimal orchestra, or mimicking Arnold, or it sounds like a Remote Control goon was asked to do additional music. James Bond scores were always fantastic at the musical principle of \\"theme and variation\\". But, aside from two or three musical fragments that reoccur, there is no theme whatsoever. The most obvious thematic cue, \\"Komodo Dragon\\", is a mixture of Barry and Arnold, it sounds like it's about to break into a cue from Casino Royale any second. The sound of this score sounds like this: take Quantum Of Solace, amp up the electronics, remove every lush or obvious thematic moment on top the electronics, tone down the orchestra, add an odd mix, and there you have Skyfall.<br />Newman seems to try to use character themes in his score, such as the motif for M. He even seems to use the Bond theme that way.<br /><br />The action pieces, once a highlight in any Bond score, are irritatingly bland. They have that sound that Zimmer followers love so much; string pulse, big drums, drum loops. It's devastating. Every time you think Newman is on the brink of telling you something worthwhile, it's back to the drum loops. Romantic music, always a strong point in the series, is virtually nonexistent. There is something that could be called a motif for Severine in \\"Severine\\" and \\"Modigliani\\", but that idea is discarded with quickly, as it happens with every other musical idea that begins to sound interesting. Adele's title song is rarely heard in the score as well; probably a good idea, since that song outclasses Newman's effort iin terms of memorability. Which by itself makes a statement, given that the song is anything but perfect.<br /><br />What makes a James Bond score unique and different from other action scores is not the James Bond theme, it is how the score and music is structured. It has always followed its own rules, and once it steps outside these, and follows the usual spy/action scoring rules, it becomes just part of the current spy/thriller/action genre style. And that is what Skyfall is. Speaking of the James Bond theme, it is the main theme of the score. Really. Which to me seems pretty lazy. What adds to the anonymity of Skyfall is the fact that Newman did not record his own version of the theme, which every composer in the series did. In \\"Breadcrums\\", Newman simply re-records Arnold's \\"The Name's Bond, James Bond\\" from Casino Royale, sounding smaller and slightly bored. The score reduces the theme mostly to the chromatic vamp underneath, except when it's played in brass two or three times. In \\"Granborough Road\\", the guitar riff is softly played on piano. This is probably the closest anyone ever came to cutting the balls off that theme.<br /><br />I read people stating Skyfall is unique. I can't accept that. Compared to Bourne and other flicks released recently, it's not that different, and its uniqueness in the series is also questionable. Thomas Newman singlehandedly delivered the most anonymous score in the series; no theme, no identity. Just listen to other action scores these days. How refreshing would a score in the classic sense be, with bold statements and courage to say something? As it is, Newman decides to simply swim with the swarm. And for the 50th anniversary film, again, this is beyond dissapointing.<br /><br />The album presentation is puzzling, not only because it may actually be too long - the rhythmic pulsing ishard to endure for 70 minutes - but also because the tracks are out of film order. The end is unspectacular. The album not so much ends as it fizzles away. Why they chose \\"Adrenaline\\" (the end credits music) to close the album and not the final statement of the Bond theme may cause some head-scratching.<br />Skyfall is functional film music that doesn't get in the way, that otherwise wouldn't get noticed if it didn't use one of the world's most famous themes occasionally and wasn't written for a James Bond movie.<br /><br />It is done by a fine craftsman who gets the job done but otherwise lacks the sensibility apparently to inject something special.<br />Using the Bond theme doesn't make it a Bond score.

And this is a FINE job by them.  i was very skeptical about my favorite band after Honkin on Bobo, which really blew chunks, but they seem to have gone down the path towards what made their music great during the 90's and early 00's, and this, while not having any huge breakout smashes like Just Push Play, Jaded, Walk This Way, or anythign else, has got some solid tracks and the fillers are good too!
B009JNXK88|4.0|Got this as a free app. I would easilly have been happy had I  full price.<br /><br />While I tend not to be a huge fan of platform jumping games, I enjoy a few  of them, and League of Evil is one of them.<br /><br />The fast pace and short mission length are keys to this. The time goal cor the first missions at least are under thirty seconds, and the goals tend to be meetable in a few tries. If you die, you don't have to redo a large section over and over.<br /><br />Gameplay is basically run around the bad guy base and punch the evil scientist in the head. Simple and messy (killing bad guys via a decapitating punch may require a large janitorial staff to clean up after)<br /><br />Now and then I have slight control issues, but thus far I have not been annoyed by them, mainly due to the enjoyability of the game and the fact that a level reset isn't grevious as it can be in some games.<br /><br />Engaging gameplay and fun factor, and punching evil in the face make this a yes from me.
0312641893|5.0|I've heard so many great things about Cinder, but I just never had the time to actually start it. Now, I regret doing so. Cinder absolutely deserved all of the attention it got from all the readers. Now I finally understand why so many people loved and devoured this book. For me, the thought of reading about cyborgs kind of weirded me out. I didn't exactly understand what cyborgs were, and I kind of thought I was getting myself into a book that was all about mechanics and robots. I was mistaken. True, it had a little bit of that, but it was so delicious and yummy to read about. (Does that even make sense? haha) The main protagonist, Cinder, is the best mechanic you can find in New Beijing. Despite that, she's also a cyborg, who has always been treated differently because of that. Cinder lives with her stepmother and her two stepsisters.<br />If you don't already know, Cinder is a retelling of Cinderella. That might sound a bit annoying or intimidating, but it never felt like cinderella at all. It was so different in so many ways, and I honestly loved every part of it. I liked how sometimes I expected something to happen because I know it happened in Cinderella, but then it doesn't. This book was very unexpected. Now, let's talk about the characters. Cinder was such an amazing character to get to know. I really felt connected to her, and I really liked how she coped by herself, and was so responsible in so many things. She wasn't one of those female protagonists that have you feeling sorry for them because of their sad situations. Prince Kai was in so many ways perfect, and non perfect, if you get what I mean. I really loved how the two of them met each other, and it was more to the realistic side than the oh so romantic this feels like a true fairytale side. The conflict of the story was brilliant, and just genius. I don't think there was ever a part where the story felt a tad boring, or just out of place. The flow was great, and it really got me turning pages.<br />I'm not a person who really cares about the world building, but I've got to say, it was really amazing in Cinder. Cinder takes place in the future, where science is very developed to the point where they have cyborgs, moving androids, and hovercrafts. It was mesmerizing to get into it all, and it was really fun to imagine the whole scenario. To me, I think the most important part of the book is the ending, and let me tell you, Cinder has one HECK of an ending. I absolutely loved it, and I really cannot wait to find out what happens next. Overall, I recommend Cinder to all readers out there. If you haven't read Cinder, don't wait and be an idiot like me because you will regret it.>I'm not a person who really cares about the world building, but I've got to say, it was really amazing in Cinder.

1476715904|5.0|Slammed by Colleen Hoover has solidified the New Adult genre for me as a favorite right now. Slammed was a book that contained so many emotions, struggles, three-dimensional characters, a plot that breaks your heart, and most of all, writing that is so beautiful yet at the same time simple. Slammed comes from the art of poetry called \\"slam\\". Basically it is poetry but so emotional and when one reads it, the hairs on your arm rise and you instantly feel the connection and emotion of the reader. The main protagonist Layken, her mom, and little brother just moved to a new town. There she meets Will and his little brother Caulder, the two kids instantly connect and so does Layken and Will.<br />However something major occurs in the plot and the stakes get tripled. Don't try to figure out what the major plot twist is, trust me, it isn't anything bad or severseverlyly heartbreaking, it is what actually causes the plot to be so unique and different from usual contemporary novels. I just felt for both of them so much. Will was just amazing, he had his faults like every other human being, but that's what makes him so likable. I loved the angst they went through trying to be together and also the love they both showed for their own and each other's brothers. Slammed is told from Layken's POV, she is in her last year of high school, and she was such an amazing character. I honestly don't think I was ever frustrated with any of the characters on Slammed, or even with the progression of the plot!<br />A couple of weeks later I am still as affected as I was with Slammed when I first finished it. Colleen Hoover is officially a contemporary genius. I can't say how much I am in love with Slammed. Just thinking about it makes my heart flutter. I recommend it to every single contemporary fan out there with no exceptions!! Pick it up right now, you won't regret it. I finally have added another book to my all time favorites shelf, trust me, it is very rare for that to happen.

0345803485|2.0|Fifty Shades appeals to the collective psyche because we all have a voyeuristic quality. Having said that one must swim through a sea of quick sand of poor writing, repetitive and mindless dialogue in addition to a few escapades that are so ridiculous they detract from the steamy sex.  It is as if the writer were throwing everything and the kitchen sink into it. ok so we have a bad ass Billionaire Christian, attracted to a woman Anna who has not a low but NO self esteem. Such is the problem that upon her first person self description I had difficulty imagining her as even slightly attractive. In itself that was a buzz kill. I like my protagonist to be or at least feel gorgeous and not suffer from a million neurotic insecurities and self debasement.<br /><br />I mean give me a break!!, how far does a girl have to go to bag some hot ass and still have some semblance of self respect and I feel pretty!. But I guess I ask for too much given there is light bondage but more humiliation than anything else on the part of the female protagonist. The tale goes on and on with kidnapping, crazed ex's and vendettas that are so ridiculous that nothing close to real life would be comparable. Calling for an unnecessary stretch of the imagination! The end of the 3rd book is very cheesey as the happily ever after swoops in on the last 3 or less pages or less leaving one to question \\"how did we go from tortured souls to we are just a suburban couple with child and another on the way\\".<br />I will say I am glad a movie will be made since I have high hopes that the script will undergo extreme editing keeping the sexual tension between the characters alive and character development central. Who knows the female protagonist may grow a pair and give Christian a better run for his money.<br /><br />A much better written credible and sophisticated version with rich characters and better  adult steamy sex is bared to you.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|First of all, I love the characters.  Eva is my favorite.  However, she becomes a little neurotic in this book.  I would've liked to see her a little more pissy and not so needy.  That's just my opinion.  Gideon kind of pissed me off because he didn't tell Eva anything and I understan why, but did he have to make it seem like he didn't even care about her?  The book was so up and down, emotions swinging one way to the other, that I actually felt exhausted at the conclusion.<br /><br />Heart pounding, nervous, worried, and finally I decided I was stronger than Eva and would've kicked Gideon to the curb.  No matter what his motivation for being a complete a$$.<br /><br />Be prepared for a neck brace after reading this one.  I really hope the last book pulls Gideon out of the dog house.  I didn't feel that this book did.  But of course, that's just my opinion.  All in all.  Good read, unless you are on heart medication.  Then I wouldn't recommend it for health reasons:)
B0092C2X7U|1.0|if you're going to make fake reviews, at least don't make it so obvious.... Hate it when apps make fake reviews.
B002RKSZWG|4.0|I know why this is considered a classic. The language used. Contemporary novels will never be written like this. It is like reading from an artists eyes. The way sentences are written is very different to the way they are written now. A lot of thought went into each [sentence] or rather Jane Austin is so gifted it comes second nature.<br /><br />Now for the book summary and highlights. It was tough to get into. About the sixth chapter is starts getting interesting. Often you put down a book if the first chapter fails to capture the imagination, but with a 'classic' you need a little patience and endurance. It is worth the wait.<br /><br />This review is after reading the classics of War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, the Art of War, Moby Dick, Andre Norton's Saragasso Series, Charles Dickens' Our Mutual Friend, Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie, Confucius' Sayings, Common Sense by Thmas Paine, and Treasure Island (to give this context). You see I did not enjoy reading when I was young, but now older and with a 1.25 hour commute on the train (to Brisbane from Gold Coast) and back, I have time !<br /><br />Compared to Charles Dickens, it is an easier read. Charles' book was a tougher read and more complex but it did go into Persuasion but moreso into the realm of manipulation. If you enjopy Persuasion, you should read Dickens' book. Mind you Dickens' book is an even tougher read - I re-read the first seven chapters 3 times ! but it is definitely worth it. Like digging for gold - you struggle a lot, but when you find the gold it is like WOW !<br /><br />Anne Elliott is somewhat ignored by her family (Father Sir Walter and Sister Elizabeth). Her mother passes and their finances are in disarray. Miss Russell a confidant of Sir Walter contrives a scheme to boost their cashflow while moving them elsewhere with little impact to their social-life. Anne who is steadfast and reasonable and even tempered throughout the story demonstrates that not everyone can be manipulated and if you are even-tempered and reasonable, nothing will escape your obsveration.<br /><br />She comes across Mr Worthington (admiral) and initially she hopes to marry him, then the persuausive schemes start and you know throughout the whole book, I'm looking for acts of Persuasion to give this book meaning and the answer is found in the last chapter and Jane Austin neatly ties the story into a happy ending. Through acts behind the seen a third party is after Anne's affections and this person works in concert with other key characters until Anne bumps into an old friend Mrs Smith and the whole scheme is turned on its head !<br /><br />In truth, the major drama surrounds louisa who falls while being silly and nearly kills herself, but the way it is written that part seems trivial and it is used to free certain people and allow certain things to swing in motion. If only Mr Elliot was there sooner and saved Louisa.... There's a thought, then this story may have gone a differnet direction. Read this and see if this review makes any sense at all !?!and if you are even-tempered and reasonable, nothing will escape your obsveration.<br /><br />She comes across Mr Worthington (admiral) and initially she hopes to marry him, then the persuausive schemes start and you know throughout the whole book, I'm looking for acts of Persuasion to give this book meaning and the answer is found in the last chapter and Jane Austin neatly ties the story into a happy ending.

B0091REZMW|5.0|its so much fun its also kinda addictive i hope u love it as much as i do. see u in the game
B0060CXAHC|2.0|Lilo & Stitch is an okay movie if you really want to see this Disney movie.<br /><br />Pros:  The music was lively and seemed to match the scenes (especially if you are an Elvis fan) and the Stitch character was somewhat cute (when he tapped into his sensitive side and he wasn't being destructive)<br /><br />Cons:  A little too much reality for a Disney flick, the main characters lacked warmth, appeared bratty (and violent), and the beginning alien scenes seemed a little long.<br /><br />I really just wanted to rent this but unfortunately had to purchase it in order to view it.<br /><br />I don't recommend it.
B00886XQO0|1.0|My first review.  I had to write about my poor experience with this headset.<br /><br />First let me say that I love my original Turtle Beach X41's.  They were my first gaming headset and I was well pleased with my purchase!  I thought it was time for an upgrade and what better time to upgrade to the Tango's?  So I preordered and they arrived a day after release date!  I was happy.<br /><br />I was not happy for long. I must say they look great and the features sound wonderful, but it's not what it claims to be.  The leather ears are too hot and uncomfortable for my head.  I never felt my ears sweat until wearing these.  Not cool.  It's too tight and muffled around my ears.  When chatting through the headset it sounds like I am plugging my ears and I hear an echo.  I should not hear my self talk when chatting.  It's not the equipment failing its the way it wraps around my ears so tight and blocks all sound from going in or out.  Try cupping your ears with both hands and talking, it's like that.<br /><br />Also, the sounds are not good.  I tried all the presetting and didn't like any.  They are terrible.  Hard to explain why.  I really tried to make it work, but it's not an upgrade, it's a downgrade.  I couldn't tell where footsteps were coming from and the presetting for footsteps were even worse then just using my TV w/o headsets.  I ended up putting it on stereo so I could hear what side foot steps were coming from.  I am not willing to pay $300 on a nice looking, BO2 branded, headsets that only provides stereo.<br /><br />I tried Black OPS, Halo Reach, Modern Warfare 3, Mass Effect, and Gears of War 3, but nothing sounded good with them, nothing sounded \\"natural\\" or \\"right\\" either.  The breaking point for me was last night on release day of Halo 4 and I could not hear certain dialog throughout the campaign - I tried every setting and preset and nothing helped.  They just don't work like expected.  Imagine seeing mouths move but you can't hear anything they are saying, all you hear is back round noises and it was unpredictable when it would work and not.  I had to play more than half the campaign with subtitles on just to understand the story for one of the best games of the year.  Sad.<br /><br />Needless to say I have switched back to my X41's and am happy again.<br /><br />Bottomline: I didn't like them at all: My head was too hot, it was uncomfortable, I heard my own muffled echo, I could not hear in-game voices sometimes, and most importantly I could not hear footsteps.ying, all you hear is back round noises and it was unpredictable when it would work and not.

B006LG7GIQ|5.0|Reall was entranced with this movie.  I like seeing movies about 'actual' events.  I had never heard of this tragedy and I guess the thing that entranced me the most at is both of these people are still alive and functioning.  I would love to read the book but the cost of it is prohibitive (current over 25.00 at Amazon) - should it become less expensive I would definitely buy it.
B0010SKUYM|1.0|This story is so well written that even if you're not a fantasy enthusiast, and I am not, you will love this series. Forget that his descriptions take you beyond the real world into a dreamland. Instead the remarkable linguistics are accurate and moving to the point of transcending the realm of fantasy. The few examples of fantasy I have had the opportunity to read can not hold a candle to the understanding of Rothfuss who ignites written word. Other fantasy series pale in comparison.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Cormac Mccarthy-ish but in modern LA- I say that since the anti-hero of the book is simple and the plot is straight forward but the dialogue is sharp and crisp and the entire movie is nihilistic yet Judeo-Christian all at once (both in a subtle way). Its not typical Hollywood garbage but well very executed and understated.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is fun. I wish I didn't have to wait so long to recharge energy but it is a good game.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I loved this book, just as much as the first one! I loved how well written it was. I loved that each page I read edged me on to want to turn the page to find out more! I highly recommend this book and I can not wait for the next one :-)
B008BM9L72|1.0|It was like each chapter was the same as the last. I read the trilogy, well skimmed the last two as the series is very boring. E L James must be laughing all the way to the bank. I must say the marketing strategy certainly worked.

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|The most recent update to this game leaves me very frustrated.  It freezes constantly and I have to turn off the Kindle Fire to restart the game.  Also, the amount of energy never updates correctly when you have completed a quest.  There isn't enough energy to ever complete the quests in a timely manner.  Some of the buildings needed to complete quests require real money to purchase. I refuse to use real money to play a game! They need a new update to hopefully fix these issues.  Very dissappointed.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|This book, in addition to others, has been life changing. I no longer eat animals or animal products. My husband does, but makes more responsible choices now that we have more information.

B000RZGFZC|5.0|This album proves that Slayer doesn't need to mention Satan to make a great album. I don't think they mention him through the whole album. It's all about real life things like war, homicide, Ed Gein/murder (Dead Skin Mask is by far my favorite track!!) and apocalypse, which WE are all causing by the way. So if your parents don't let you listen to the \\"satanic music\\", this album will teach you about the book of revelations!! \m/
0425263908|5.0|Captavating story of two sexual abuse survivors, Eva and Gideon. Sylvia Day takes you on a roller coaster of emotion throughout the book. Gideon is mega-hot and Eva is so real that you feel you are part of their story.  And the sex-scenes, whew!  No one writes like Sylvia (sorry Nora!)
B004WO9F56|4.0|Tobias Sammet has emerged as one of the most creative forces of the European metal scene in this decade with this show, the culmination of one of the most spectacular collaborations of the last decade.  The cornerstone of course is the stunning \\"Scarecrow\\" album and its many great songs.<br /><br />If you haven't ever heard the amazing 2008 CD \\"The Scarecrow\\" by Avantasia, you really should!  It is one of the best metal albums ever made.  Yes, I said it.  But when your supporting cast includes Roy Khan, Jorn Lande, Michael Kiske, Sascha Paeth, Oliver Hartmann, Amanda Somerville, Eric Singer, Alice Cooper, Miro, Kai Hansen, Rudolph Schenker, this is not a boast.  This is True Metal!<br /><br />For the last decade we have had a flood of opera and symphony into the European metal scene.  This was not a bad thing.  Some stunning, complex, rich, subtle music was made.  But with the 2008 release of \\"The Scarecrow\\", I think we saw the pendulum swing back (truer today in 2012) to more of a basic True Metal, or a Heavy Metal style reminiscent of its roots in the late 70s and 80s with bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Saxon, Sabbath (with Dio singing), etc.<br /><br />So even though the cast of characters are heavy players in the operatic / symphonic metal scene over the last decade, I would not say this work goes too deeply into those themes, although it would be incorrect to say \\"The Scarecrow\\" is absolutely not a symphonic metal work.  It certainly is.  But it also heralds a return back away from the operatic, to the pure rock vocals of Heavy Metal.  of True Metal.<br /><br />Tobias Sammet gets most of the credit there, and his older band Edguy was pretty much meat&potatoes metal too, so he is a good apostle for this return to roots.  And to accentuate his points he chose one of the most ferocious, as well as one of the most \\"throwback sounding\\" metal monsters alive today, Jorn Lande.<br /><br />Lande adds the thunder to Sammet's lightning.  Their duets on \\"The Scarecrow\\" and \\"Another Angel Down\\" on the Scarecrow CD were some of the greatest moments in metal in the entire 2000s decade.  If you've heard the songs you know this is fact, it is not mere hyperbole.<br /><br />With so much talent in Europe, these collaborative efforts become something greater than a mere band.  Avantasia is a Supergroup.  You are getting nothing less than pure professionalism, impeccable taste and passion with their products.<br /><br />The sound on this disc is quite good, as is the video quality.  It definitely feels like a Blu Ray quality show, not something shot in standard definition and then upscaled.  Clarity and color are good for a rock concert shot at night.<br /><br />This is the best performance I have seen from Sascha Paeth and Oliver Hartmann on guitar.  Paeth especially was \\"On\\" here and plays especially well.  I esteem Hartmann even more due to his amazing singing voice - arguably better than any of the others here - and Hartmann's guitar skills are not to be underestimated, he is in fact a very accomplished neoclassical shredder on demand - but Paeth seems to get the better of him this night.<br /><br />The set list is amazing and Avantasia throw in just enough lighter material to allow you to catch your breath between the faster, true metal songs.  Luckily we get treated to some of the songs that are essential that weren't on \\"The Scarecrow\\" album, like \\"Reach out for the Light\\", and \\"Serpents in Paradise\\".<br /><br />At their most metal, Avantasia remind one of Helloween, Rhapsody, Gamma Ray, the oldschool Eurometal bands from late 90s.<br /><br />I can't say enough about what a good frontman Tobias Sammet is.  He handles the crowd with class and charm.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a great show in HD quality by a great band filled with total pro musicians and playing very listenable, very good quality heavy metal, played the European way.<br /><br />You won't regret buying this disc.<br /><br />The only criticism I canoffer here of this very-well made Blu Ray concert event is that Tobias' voice unfortunately has deteriorated a little bit, and though he warms up 3 or 4 songs into the set, he does not give his best performance on arguably the two best songs from \\"The Scarecrow\\", that being the title track, and the blistering \\"Another Angel Down.\\"  Sammet recovers, but he seems very winded at the beginning of the show and can barely hit the notes in \\"The Scarecrow\\".  Picking \\"Another Angel Down\\" to follow it was unfortunate, as Sammet appears completely gassed during that 3rd song.  The pace was a little quick, and Jorn Lande stumbles a little trying to keep up a faster pace than on the album cut.  Compared to their Wacken 2011 daytime performance, this Blu Ray show is slightly below it in quality of singing from both Sammet and his amazing guest, Jorn Lande.  As \\"Another Angel Down\\" is probably my favorite Avantasia song, it was definitely disappointing that Sammet had his worst performance on my favorite song.offer here of this very-well made Blu Ray concert event is that Tobias' voice unfortunately has deteriorated a little bit, and though he warms up 3 or 4 songs into the set, he does not give his best performance on arguably the two best songs from \\"The Scarecrow\\", that being the title track, and the blistering \\"Another Angel Down.\\"  Sammet recovers, but he seems very winded at the beginning of the show and can barely hit the notes in \\"The Scarecrow\\".

B000S5ASM2|5.0|I first heard this symphony in high school in a music appreciation class.  I have heard many of it's themes echoed in lot's of movies, especially Westerns.  Often it is appropriate music that up's a films watchability and appeal a notch.  To bad Hollywood does not realize this as many movies are taken down a notch in appeal because the music is not appealing.<br /><br />I recommend that schools re-invigorate music appreaciation classes.  When you hear a symphony like this, your music sensibilities are developed and help you develop a immunity to trash.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have not sat down and read a novel / book for probably 20 years.  I had heard a group of friends talking about the Fifty Shades Triology a few months ago but never really thought I had the time to read it.  One day I was looking at the Kindle App on my tablet and saw the Fifty Shades books.  I decided to read the Free book one preview.  Well let me tell you, that's all it took for me.  I was hooked!  When the preview ended, I couldn't order Book One fast enough.  I must admit, I was obsessed.  I read all three books in SEVEN DAYS! I loved it.  Each chapter ended with a suspense that made me go right to the next chapter to see what happened.
B00866H7SS|5.0|I loved this book, so well written and i could not put it down once I started, read the first and second book within two weeks, cant wait for the third. Fifty shades of grey was nothing compared to these books i loved!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love the Crossfire novels. I was told they were better than the Fifty Shades and I don't regret reading them instead!
B003QSMCKO|4.0|It is nice to reminiscent on real classics and to show my niece what a animated movie must be like, two bird with one stone
B005KR6OBM|5.0|At first the characters are so bizarre it is difficult to grasp the subtext. When you have tuned in, there are some magic moments with physics in-jokes that are funny on several levels. Sheldon is an extraordinary creation, an authentic sufferer from Asperger's Syndrome. We all probably know someone at least a little like that. The classic symptoms are low social intelligence, hiding of feelings and poor communication skills. We need not feel sorry for the poor fellow and can laugh at his gaffes because aspics are thick-skinned, too self-absorbed to care about disapproval by others. The other 3 male characters seem to be based on generic models of normal, Jewish and Indian physicists. The shows I have watched so far, only the 1st season, are very fast moving considering their abstract topics and a delight to observe and re-watch with friends.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|My wife and I went to the movie theater to see this movie in 3D when it first came out.  Unfortunately, the theater lost power and after 45 minutes of waiting, we were told we'd get to see any other movie we wanted for free.  As time played it, we didn't get to see Prometheus until we rented it on Amazon.<br /><br />The movie isn't all that.  It's more of a combination of Alien, Aliens, and Predator II, with a very tiny bit of Armageddon (mainly limited to the \\"sophisticated\\" equipment portrayed in the movie), and it really doesn't have much of a plot.  It's ok for a one time rental, whether in HD or SD, but given that it didn't stay in the movie theaters long enough, such should be a clue.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not Grisham's best book (I've read them all) but definitely entertaining.  I like that I really never know how one of his books is going to end until the very end and for me, The Racketeer was no different.  I pre-ordered it and tore through it pretty fast so I'd say that is the sign of a good book.

0385344333|4.0|Reacher is hitchhiking a ride in the middle of nowhere in Nebraska trying to get to Chicago en route to meeting a woman in Virginia. This has been his destination for the last couple of books. He is picked up by two men and a woman in the back seat. Of course, things are not simply what they appear to be. The three are not just business executives returning from a business meeting to Chicago. Roadblocks are everywhere as, unknown to Reacher, a man lies stabbed in the town they all just left. Eventually he figures out what is happening and things escalate from there to the usual explosive climax.<br /> The Reacher thrillers tend to move with a propulsive plot. What is most interesting about this particular book is that little physically happens for the first third of the book. Yet, there is unmistakable suspense. Who are these people? What have they done? Why are the roadblocks in place? All of these questions eventually get answered but it is the pure suspense that Lee Child creates that keeps the pages turning. It is this first part of the book that I found to be most interesting and shows off the multiple talents of Lee Child. He doesn't need just pure action to keep a reader glued to the page. Once we get to the usual good guys vs. bad guys, the book becomes the hot ticket item that so many of Reacher's fans love. As usual, highly recommended.
B008HK3S9K|5.0|This Timbuk2 sleeve case is tough as nails. Timbuk2 products are extremely durable and last for years and years. It appears to be made from the same ballistic nylon cloth that goes into their messenger bags. Despite its quilted appearance, the material is remarkably stiff and thick. The flowery surface is hydrophobic and feels like a raincoat I once owned. I did a quick spill test with a cup of water. The liquid beaded up and rolled off the sleeve immediately. The seam binding (black edges), however, is not hydrophobic, so if you have an accidental spill, you should wipe off the case quickly to prevent too much absorption.<br /><br />The product looks more vibrant in the photo than in real life. I'm not thrilled about the underside. It looks like a big purple oven mitt. But, if you're looking for a case that wraps around your Kindle Fire or Kindle Keyboard, this is a good choice. It is TSA approved, for those who travel often by air. No need to remove your device from the holder for X-raying.

I can't get enough of spartacus the women are sexy and the men are loaded with high levels of testosterone. andy whitfield is sadly missed by family friends and fans. If there is a after life then spartacus he is. No man can do his role so liam has to try too fill his shoes to finish this AWSOME SERIES!!! GOD BLESS YOU ANDY A TRUE GLADIATOR!!!! G. philadelphia pa.

0316228532|1.0|After rereading my review of The Casual Vacancy I realized it sounded sloppy and very unprofessional. I decided to edit my entire review and start from scratch.<br /><br />I had such high expectations for The Casual Vacancy and I was extremely letdown. I'll admit that the only reason that I read this book is because I adore J.K. Rowling and her Harry Potter series. I was so excited to read a new J.K. Rowling book that I didn't care that The Casual Vacancy was nothing like her Harry Potter series. (That's not to say that I secretly wished that The Casual Vacancy was some sort of spin off or sequel to Harry Potter.)<br /><br />Though J.K. Rowling's writing style is evident in The Casual Vacancy, nevertheless reading The Casual Vacancy felt like a form of torture. I lacked any emotional attachment or connection with the characters in The Casual Vacancy. The only emotions towards the characters in this book were repulsion and extreme distaste. The political structure of this book was portrayed in a manner that was unappealing and tedious.<br /><br />I felt like The Casual Vacancy unnecessarily dirty and vulgar. I believe that J.K. Rowling was trying to differentiate from her children's books by adding rape, pedophilia, sex scenes, and adult content. How many times can you drop the f-bomb before it becomes irritating?<br /><br />It is truly alarming how 5 star reviews I have seen that were written by people who have never even read The Casual Vacancy. It truly defeats the purpose of Goodreads to review and rate a book you have never even read.<br /><br />I wish I had a better experience reading The Casual Vacancy. The Casual Vacancy was very dull and I struggled to read a few chapters. One day I hope I will attempt to finish The Casual Vacancy but for now I'm marking it as DNF.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I must say just loved it! The suspense was great the book was fantastic all the way to the end.  The minute I received my email I downloaded it to my kindel  and read  it late into the night to finish the following day. I am already looking forward to his next book.

B0083SBMBM|4.0|The lascivious nature of my review title is but an illusion.  I simply mean that this movie took me back to the days when I would fill up our double-kitchen sinks and play with my action figures in the water while kneeling on a 2-step footstool.<br />I pitted my \\"guys\\" against eachother in the roiling seas; heads glued on - toothpicks replacing missing lightsabers and, ultimately, there could be only one.  *Spoiler*  (It was Optimus Prime)<br /><br />Iron Man vs. Thor - Thor vs. Hulk - Hulk vs. Loki... what more could you ask for?<br /><br />Except maybe a semi-trailer truck that turns into a humongous robot and a prolonged hot yoga scene with Black Widow... just to establish character.<br /><br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go play with my guys.
B005PMNBNG|4.0|This is one of those albums that, as you make your way through it, has you saying, \\"Oh yeah, THAT'S who that song is by!\\"<br />I think you first have to like this type of music, which is a bit hard to define... kind of a post rock, electronic arrangement that is sprinkled with just a little 80's flavor (but not nearly enough to make it annoying like a lot of the stuff out there).  \\"Midnight City\\" and \\"Reunion\\" are the obvious standouts... and the videos are pretty cool too.  \\"Wait\\" is my personal favorite.<br />My only gripe is that the order of the songs could have been a little different.  I won't make suggestions regarding what order I think it should, because you should form your own opinion, with the exception of \\"Raconte - Moi Une Histoire\\" (followed by \\"Train to Pluton\\", as they 'fit').  I like the song, but it kind of disrupts the flow for me.... might have been better toward the end of the album.<br />I tend to be very critical when looking at a collection as a whole, because, as long as it's in a genre you like, you can always find at least one or two songs you like.  That said, there is a thoughtfulness to this album and a mood to each song that warrants four stars.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|One of my favorite books ever. I started reading this Nov. 1st and finished now. I couldn't put my Kindle down, and it died several times because I wouldn't charge it. I loved it so much.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I always enjoy Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta books, but felt this was little predictable. Still enjoyable! One major plot, not as many sub-plots, but I still felt it was good.

B0098VYCCE|2.0|The truth of this film and its beauty was overcast by the sheer lack of talent of of you guessed it the twilight chick, Kristian Stewart.<br />The writer must have been sadly disjointed to see this chick cast in the film.<br />Just stop already and leave the acting to professionals.<br />stop trying and just vanish please do us all a favor spare us your ridiculous open mouth routine.<br />I will say this the supporting cast carried her through the entire film and her lack of talent is most obvious and most disturbing in this film.<br />she stood there dumbfounded and never once added anything except her sheer lack of commitment to the film how could she do otherwise. (a moron is a moron )<br />I waited very patiently for her to warm up to the role, truthfully she never did !!<br />She stumbled through the entire film and never  did the theme change  the cast was incredible and the script thought provoking , but they should have simply cast someone else for the lead, and left her in twilight mode its a role that suits her best.<br />I avoided the twilight series for that reason alone twenty minutes into the film i wanted to scream and shut it off.<br />She is simply the most mindless stupid actress i have ever encountered.<br />The film could have been incredible  but sadly failed because of its leading actress .<br />sorry i don't even give it three stars .
B0015KGWZG|5.0|I had just finished Codependent No More, another book I highly recommend; and a friend referred the Erroneous Zones to me.  It's a fantastic no nonsense talk straight book.

B008NW67E0|2.0|I was very excited to get this album on vinyl the day it came out. It was a great month for music a new album from Band of Horses, Beth Orton and Mumford and Sons. I have to admit that out of the 3 this was my least favorite album. It seems each song blends in with the next..I can't tell the difference. It seems they allowed \\"producers\\" to guide them into this album and that's sad b/c these guys are very talented. Mumford and Sons are known for their constant touring and probably need to slow down-and write some good songs. They have it in them, as they are young and still have so much steam to blow. Marcus has a voice that is as raw and solid-and probably the most talented out of  most of the new bands out there (not including Band of Horses)-but somehow this album fell flat. Could it be the always on tour and really felt pushed to come out with a album? bad choices? who knows but I'm not giving up on this band-hopefully, they'll be around for years to come. My only advice-go on tour and then remember take time to write..make a decent album. I'll be waiting the next time around.

B008J9EYFG|4.0|I was so happy to see Beth Orton come out with a new album. I was beginning to wonder if she dropped out of the scene. 6 years has gone by-and I still remember buying her last album the day it came out. I wasn't a fan of it and felt with that voice, she fell flat on that album. I bought this album on vinyl  and was very surprised how much she didn't disappoint. Her voice is still as heavenly as it once was. There are songs that stand above the rest and then there are a couple that seem to dwindle on a little to long and get lost in it all. I will admit I do like the album and love the cover. I missed her. She reminds me of my days with red hair and having nothing but time on my hands. I feel she is an artist that has gone unlooked and hopefully people will catch on to her.
B0017XFBMG|5.0|This boxed set is a treasure trove for the rabid Pogues fan, and I count myself as a member of that group.  I need to point out here, at the beginning of the review, that if you are a casual Pogues fan, or someone who isn't familiar with the Pogues, this is NOT the set for you.  This isn't a boxed set of the Pogues greatest songs and it isn't a career retrospective.  It's a boxed set of rare tracks, demos, live cuts and such of varied sound quality throughout.<br /><br />With that said, I love this set.  It is great to hear the band work through some of their songs in demo form where we can hear the progression to a finished piece.  This is especially true for the \\"Fairytale of New York\\" cuts.  There are three of them provided here from the songs most raw form.  Amazing stuff.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of songwriting and hearing so many of these songs in their infancy was very cool.  For the casual fan they may find no joy at all in hearing rough cuts where the lyrics or melody was different than what became the finished song.<br /><br />As much as I love this boxed set, it isn't something that I normally run to for casual listening.  When I'm in the mood to hear some Pogues I'll reach for one of the first 5 albums they released with Shane MacGowan at the helm.  If I had to pick just one album to get someone into the Pogues it would be, without a doubt, \\"If I Should Fall From Grace With God\\" which is perhaps the best album ever recorded.<br /><br />The bottom line here is that this is an amazing boxed set, but it's not for the casual fan.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Where to begin.....this is one of the most emotionally stimulating books. I feel like I've been living the book right along with the characters. This author is wonderful!
B0086900TI|4.0|Sure, the lead character in this film is a substitute teacher, but this is NOT a movie about teachers or the educational system.  It's about relationships and the lead just happens to be a teacher.  Most of the character's interaction comes between him and a young girl, a prostitute he met on the streets, and his grandfather, who is living out his final days in a hospital / nursing home.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie and think that it hit its mark by showing how people can be completely detached from their world and the people in it.  It is hard to go into much details without throwing out spoilers left and right, so I'll just say that the progression of the lead character through the film was an interesting one to watch, if the ending was a bit predictable.<br /><br />Some people will find the movie disturbing on how realistically it shows life and death and our reactions to it.  There is no spoiler in telling you the lead character is detached from just about everything in his life, the title pretty much sums that up for us.  It is, however, still disturbing to see what that translates to when he comes across the prostitute the first time and does nothing to help as a man on a bus beats her just a few feet from where he's sitting.<br /><br />At one point in the movie, the one student that he does have somewhat of a relationship comes and tries to talk to him about her problems.  She's depressed, you can pretty much tell she is suicidal and when she breaks down crying and grabs onto him he can't do much to console her.  Another teacher walks in and immediately infers that he's having an inappropriate relationship with the student because he was having physical contact with her, making a great point on just how easily things are misconstrued in our world today.<br /><br />This isn't a date movie, it's not a feel good movie.  It's dark, it's dreary and there isn't much hope to be found in most of the journey.  But, with that said, I think it's still a very thought provoking film that will poke you in places you probably don't want to be poked.  It is guaranteed to make you think, so I have to give it a watch recommendation.rovoking film that will poke you in places you probably don't want to be poked.

B006TAJ9YI|5.0|I like Crocs because they are comfortable, easy on and off, and have substantial ventilation.  That's true of all Crocs.  What I especially like about the \\"sport\\" model is their lugged sole.  With two pairs of traditional Crocs I've had, the soles wore down to a smooth, slick surface which is exceptionally slippery and dangerous on wet, smooth, hard surfaces such as concrete and tile. The soles wore down to a smooth surface way before the rest of the shoe wore out.  And while I do not have long term experience with the duet \\"sport\\" model, their lugged soles, with all the material down there, just have to have a longer life than traditional Crocs.

0061692042|1.0|\\"Loneliness, I've read, is like being in a long line, waiting to reach the front where it's promised something good will happen. Only the line never moves, and other people are always coming in ahead of you, and the front, the place where you want to be, is always farther and farther away until you no longer believe it has anything left to offer you.\\"<br /><br />I personally didn't find Richard Ford's writing style to be very moving or interesting; other reviewers have mentioned the excessive descriptions. Unfortunately, for me, the descriptions in this book didn't shine but rather cast a dusty, meaningless listless haze over all the characters. And all the characters seem to be trapped in a line as described above. It feels like a novel written about the DMV. The main character waits and waits and finally manages to complete his errand, and is compelled to recount his experience in great detail. Other characters are violent and impatient and are removed and others think they can skip ahead and wind up behind. If life is like a line at the DMV, it expertly describes the impatience, the inevitability, and the inability to leave with the unbearable attention to detail.<br /><br />However, I do NOT think that life is like a line at the DMV. I found that 400 pages of listening to someone stuck in line, describing in great detail the minutiae of waiting, was not inspiring or moving but incredibly depressing. If you don't like it at first, it doesn't get better.

0156027321|5.0|Author Yann Martel had done a masterful job with his book entitled, \\"Life of Pi\\".  I will even go as far as to write that it was a work of genius how Martel wrote himself into this story as a writer looking to find a topic for his next book when it is brought to his attention that of an adult Indian man living in Canada by the name of Piscine Molitor Patel who goes by the nickname Pi and his extraordinary tale of survival under the most unbelievable circumstances.  And so begins an exciting tale of Pi afloat in the middle of the sea for 227 days with his only companion in the lifeboat being a full grown Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  Throughout their ordeal to survive a remarkable relationship and understanding develops between the two allowing them to coexist in their struggle.  Although this is work of fiction, Yann Martel writes it so convincingly that I so often had to remind myself that it was not a book of non-fiction.  And even at its end I still found myself questioning if the whole story actually did happen.  That, my friends, is the talent of a great story teller!

The Casual Vacancy was not a disappointment but rather a most interesting read. There were many characters but the author described them in a way that you got to know each one.  I hope it doesn't become a movie because I can picture what each character looks like in my mind's eye. The story<br />,Casual Vacancy, was most interesting in itself and unusual in its english venue.

0307948110|5.0|Harris has masterfully crafted an exceptional book! Super job. I enjoyed The Ghost Writer and picked this up at the airport. SO glad I did. Wow! The best smart fiction contains four elements, and this one rings the bell loudly on all counts: Plot, Characters, Wordsmithing, and Research deftly woven in regarding a topic of importance. Also, very importantly, the author treats the reader as an astute adult, capable of exploring varieties of possible interpretation on characters' thoughts, actions, words. Having traveled in and around Geneva, and extensively across Europe, it is wryly satisfying to enjoy Harris' illumination of the subtleties and tensions of competing cadres in this contemporary borderland. Highly recommended!

B0085RQLXK|5.0|Aerosmith is an amazing band and a ton of farts have a hard time accepting a bands music as they get a tad older. As a avid Aerosmith fan, I grew up on the licks of Pump and Get a Grip. I enjoyed Nine Lives and even to a lesser extent Just Push Play. Both albums though lived on I feel 1 great song, with alot of \\"nice\\" songs around them (though Just Push Play had a few full on duds). Music From Another Dimension has 6 songs that are as good or better than anything on those 2 albums. I hate how people compare this record to \\"Rocks\\" or their older stuff. I think its a nice mix of their old sound, 90s sound and a new sound. The best rock ballad band in the world, brings to us 2 new classics that are very different than anything they have done before in What Could of Been Love and Can't Stop Loving You. Oh Yea is a powerful rock song, don't drive when you listen to it, you may crash. Beautiful and Love XXX and very very strong, but the highlight to me is Legendary Child. This song frankly belongs up there with some of my favs and I think in time, might (though rock just doesn't have the same main street appeal it once did). Despite that, I put Legendary Child up there with some of the best, Livin' on the Edge, Love in an Elevator, (Dude) Looks Like a Lady. Remember, you have loved those songs for 20+ years. Give Legendary Child a shot, I think you will eventually see it's a classic. Just a great album and a welcome return from America's greatest rock and roll band....no.....FROM THE WORLD'S GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book, not unlike all of his previous fictional publications, is one that I read cover to cover, non-stop. With character development and exciting action building page by page, one cannot put it down. This book is fascinating fiction, and that is demonstrated by the lack of research and sources which went it its writing. The author put this down on paper straight out of his head, for the most part. It was a joy to read, and, again, I can't wait for the day in the future when I will see that his next book is about to be released.

I have get Wool 6 & 7, First and Second Shift respectively, on my Kindle ASAP!  While reading Wool, I have to force myself to not jump ahead in order to release the tension regarding what is about to happen to one of Mr. Howey's characters.  I find ways to identify with the characters, even the villains, that make them feel real and very human.  No one dimensional characters here, even the ones you barely get to know.<br /><br />I'm not prone to take the time to write reviews, but I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Wool experience, and thus had to share my delight.<br /><br />EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!

B008S80OU2|4.0|What a huge amount of music packed into one box!  It's a testament to the band's staying power & career that this has come out.  As a long time fan, I've been hoping very much for solid remasters of more of their albums!<br /><br />I'd recommend this to any collector, or anyone just getting into BOC.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is mainly the packaging, and a nit I have to pick with the quality of \\"On Your Feet\\".<br /><br />First, the sound!  They've really cleared up the level problems these albums had.  I notice some extreme differences on Revolution By Night's \\"Shooting Shark\\", for example.  You can hear things in the recording that you really didn't notice before.  The old levels were really low, and made the whole album's sound quality flat; now, they are pumped up, and clearer.  This is the case across the board, on all the discs.<br /><br />The album I was most looking forward to was \\"On Your Feet or On Your Knees\\", mainly because it's such a stellar live performance, and has never been given a fair shot sound-wise using modern techniques.  I was hoping more work would be put into re-mixing the sound.  They did bring up the levels, and clean things up; but these albums were technically \\"Newly-Mastered\\", not actually \\"Re-Mastered\\".  What I mean is, some of the Re-mastering efforts I've heard lately involve going back to the original source material, and working from that using modern tech.  I think, but cannot be sure, that less was done for these recordings.  They sound better, and amazingly so in most cases.  But this particular album could have been so much more.  Still, it's a big improvement as it is.<br /><br />The packaging: I hoped for more here too.  I would have liked to have seen the contents of the booklets in the re-mastered CD's of the early 2000's (the \\"Black & White albums, Agents of Fortune, etc).  The material in those was such high-quality; liner notes, full-color repro of gatefold art, lyrics, etc.  I'd have expected that level of treatment for all the discs in this set; sadly, we get cardboard sleeves, and a one-booklet treatment that dedicates one or two pages per album.  I'll be keeping my CD's, this box won't be replacing them :)<br /><br />All in all, this set is a fitting tribute to one of my favorite bands of all time!  Great sounding music, and that's what it's all about.  Thanks to you BOC & thanks to Sony Legacy for making it happen!<br /><br />--- Edit ---<br />I want to amend my comments about \\"On Your Feet or On Your Knees\\".  I've been listening to the set with some higher quality sound equipment, and they did indeed do a great job of remastering this classic.  All the discs sound immensely better!  On this one you can hear little sounds the audience makes, instrument & band sounds that were not audible in the original recording.  Great stuff!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I will probably always read anything Patricia Cornwell writes because she has rocked in the past with so many of her books.  Her early books were amazing in how she could write such suspensful books that held you on the edge of your seat with every word, yet tell you next to nothing about the main character, Kay Scarpetta.  Then she published \\"The Last Precinct\\" and I found it refreshing to find out who Kay Scarpetta was as a character. Since then, it seems her books are not so much about the person committing these horrendous crimes and how Scarpetta catches them using such realistic and detailed skills as a Medical Examiner.  They seem to be about all these conspiracies against Scarpetta herself and how she proves her innocence and then catches the bad guy.  This story line has become rather tiresome and I was glad to read the conspiracy was over rather quickly in \\"The Bone Bed\\" and the story moved away from Scarpetta's persecution early on and the focus remained on the crimes and the criminal commiitting them.

B008NABUU8|4.0|There are lots of reviews for this game that criticize its interface and sluggishness, but honestly I haven't experienced either of these.  Sure the controls aren't perfect, but it does a decent job of allowing you to place or remove pieces, switch between object types, and zoom in and out without being too clunky.  Perhaps I've just been playing bridge builder games since the days of Pontifex on PC, so I know what to expect.  (In fact, this game feels pretty much like a ripped and prettified version of Pontifex.)  Precision placing objects when zoomed out is next to impossible and your pieces often end up being trapped connected to the wrong node, but it's easy to correct.<br /><br />As far as sluggishness, the game plays perfectly fine on my OG Epic (Galaxy S with the keyboard).  The load screens take a little while, but no worse than another graphics intense game like Shadowgun or MC3.  Once it loads, it's actually quite quick.  Large bridges where there's lots of physics calcs going on do experience a little lag, but so did the original Pontifex.  It's likely a function of how the multi-nodal analysis is done for compression/strain.<br /><br />One thing that would be nice for the developers to include (which the Pontifex devs did), is a mirror option.  This way you could build half of the bridge (or whatever percent), flip it, then place it on the opposite side.  This would cut down build time as well as the frustration of trying to precisely copy a design when zoomed out, which as I said before is near impossible.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|This book is horrible.  The story line has been done a million times before, and it added no more depth or insight.  I felt like I was reading a strange version of The Christmas Carole. I was so happy to finish it!
B008S80OU2|4.0|The website for the live concerts does not exist, what the hell.  Besides that, it looks ok, already have much of this music. Edit.  The downloads now work, if you like BOC, this is for you.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have been a Grisham fan for years.  Even though his later works have leaned toward the liberal view of the establishment, and this book is no exception, they are still well plotted.  This book villifies all things related to our federal court system.  We must accept that the end of the plot justifies any means imaginable to get there.  But the twists and characters make it a great read.  I recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|l walk my cat on a leash, this game is great to pass the time because no one can rush Mr. Maverick!
B0092C2X7U|1.0|When I first saw this game, I thought: Wow! a good game that's free! But then I read the reviews for the app. its just another game where you jump, slide, and shoot. I was only looking for a good game that's unique and creative but I just got a game that like all the others.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|worst game in history.im going to jump off a building now.you guys can do so much better.animals good art fast cool ineed pumpkin.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really have no words to do a good job at describing this book.  I started out wanting to read it because I wanted to be in the know, I guess the curious or nosey part of me.  All I can say now is that anyone that loves America needs to read this book.  It gave me chills several times throughout.  I can't imaging the life that these guys lead day in and day out.  They so graciously put their lives right there on the line for mine and yours.  To our country, this is the biggest deal.  To them it was just another mission.  Their job.  I owe so much back to all of these men and women and I would give anything to hug each one of their necks.  Reading this gave me knowledge of things I had no idea about, but it has also renewed my pride in being from the greatest country on this Earth.  This is a must ready, no doubt.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very nice. many fun and challenging levels. i would tell anyone who likes puzzle or games that gets you thinking to download this.
B008RZF2I0|3.0|I wanted to like this album, I really did, especially after the utter disappointment of the \\"Poetry..\\" album, but in all honestly it's only a slight step above it.<br />I've been a following this band from the beginning,since BEFORE Khan was the vocalist and in my opinion they peaked with the \\"Epica\\" album and to a lesser extent musically \\"the Black Halo\\" though the latter was a bigger seller, \\"Ghost Opera\\" was decent but was the start of the band on \\"autopilot\\", and Poetry was a failed experiment in plodding mid-tempo melancholy and electronica, some of which they have carried over to this album and three albums now of \\"gothic melancholy\\" is getting a bit tired and redundant both musically and lyrically.<br />Most of the hoopla over Silverthorn revolves around the departure of Khan and addition of new vocalist Tommy Karevik, but to tell you the truth the vocals are a complete non-issue on this album, Tommy steps in and delivers the goods and feels like a natural fit for the band, the real issues here are twofold and sit squarely on the shoulders of songwriter Thomas Youngblood and producer Sascha Paeth, first the songwriting is getting downright boring, the whole album has a \\"been there,done that\\" feel to it and I don't foresee any future \\"greatest hits\\" coming off this album. The album lacks any real bite and Youngblood really needs to start putting the \\"heavy\\" back into heavy metal, or the \\"power\\" back into power metal because those are two elements that are sorely lacking here, there are only three songs on the entire album that could even remotely be construed as uptempo, and those don't hold a candle to prior ass-kickers like \\"Center of the Universe\\" or \\"Lost and Damned\\".<br />The second issue is the production, this has a compressed and muted production that really detracts and makes the songs a bit less than they can be, I don't know what is going on with Sascha Paeth whom I used to consider one of the best metal producers, but both this and the last Epica album have had abysmal production, I miss the grandiose, crisp \\"open\\" sound on prior albums, even Casey Grillo's double bass drumming on here sounds completely muted and neutered and Grillo is one of the best drummers in the biz today.<br />Sorry if this review comes across as overly negative but I feel I had to be the voice of objectivity and reason here to counteract the overly enthusiastic fanboy reviews, bottom line is that it is a decent album by one of the best American metal acts in the biz today, it has a few shining moments but is hampered from living up to it's full potential by excessive melancholy and mid-tempo numbers and a lackluster production by Kamelot standards.
1477428690|2.0|I originally purchased this book a few years ago, and it earned a place of prominence on my book shelf. I have loaned it to several friends over the years, all of whom benefitted from the easy to read insight. Unfortunately, my copy was lost on loan recently, and I decided to replace it. The newer edition, however, is about as poorly produced as books come. There are too many grammatical mistakes and the clumsy book jacket design betrays a much smarter message contained within. If there were two categories for rating, I'd give this book 5 stars for content and 1 star for production quality. I'll keep my eye out for the next edition, which will hopefully find its place back on my shelf.
B0058O84G0|4.0|A very good way to learn history. I did not know a lot about the time frame, but I've picked up a bit now thanks to this book.
0425263908|2.0|I was very disappointed with this. It is a poor and obvious imitation of \\"50 Shades of Grey\\". I won't be reading the next books in the series.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|The concept was unique as in all Ridley Scott movies, but the plot was predictable with the usual suspects doing the same thing they always do. Still entertaining and visually impressive but not a 4 star rating.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Horrible horrible movie as to plot.  Great movie for buff bodies and hot stripper action!  It was all I could do to sit through the drivel until the \\"good parts\\" came on!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|This book was a disappointment.  Was very hard to get into the storyline.  I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and this was my least favorite.  It didn't get real interesting until close to the end of the book.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|This game was awesome and well well well worth the the extra 99&cent;. The graphics were great the story line was great and I can't. wait for the sequel!!! Please make another sooooon!!! thank you'd
B00006LFGD|5.0|I have been listening to Barbra Streisand for several decades and plan to keep listening to and buying her music.  People seem to spend too much reviewing her voice etc... instead of just opening their ears and enjoying what they are listening to.  Who cares if she has a song on several of her records or CDs.  If it is worth listening to who cares.  This is a very enjoyable CD.  Love to hear her sing duets with other great singers.  Keep up the wonderful music, Barbra.  Another CD of hers that I love is: Higher Ground, which came out in the 1990s.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I was curious to read a book similar to Fifty Shades. I was pleasantly surprised with the Crossfire series. The character development was what fascinated me about \\"Fifty\\". I truly felt the author was trying to tell a story about some complicated characters, with some uh, entertaining flair. The characters were weaker in the Crossfire novel, but the story held my attention. I look forward to the third book, hopefully soon!
0140067477|5.0|I enjoyed this book because of the concepts of chi... or life force.  I definitely recommend this book in order to discover their own search for the life force.
B006H4DBA4|4.0|A great short story, felt like you could relate to the characters even in such a short time. Definately makes you think. Sophie kinsella never let's you down.
1934451320|5.0|Each life... each person needs to reflect on their own life.  This book helps to reflect on these insights about one's life.
B009YD7ZIE|1.0|My tablet DOES have Flash, so it should have no problem. Still didn't get to see the episode and I paid for it.
B0038AUYAU|3.0|Ive read all the disc world books. This one is sort of in. A separate field of endeavor. True it was written a fair long time ago. I took quite a while for me to want to keep reading it. Then it got better.<br /><br />Some of the ideas put forth about how we as humans relate with the animals around us comes through nicely
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next book to come out...a beautiful, yet painful and hard romance.  Characters are so lively...so true to to days standards of relationships and real, unconditional and undying love.
B009A9EPLM|4.0|First, a statement: any John Williams' soundtrack is infinitely superior to other soundtracks from contemporary composers. In particular, those that have been published so far this year (I keep only hope for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey). Therefore, Lincoln can only be compared with the other works of the Maestro.<br />And the result is a very beautiful and elegant soundtrack, but nothing new in Williams' career. Even the main theme (according to most critics) \\"With Malice Toward None\\" is too simple and little memorable. As in the case of War Horse, Williams gives us an excellent soundtrack, ideal to accompany the film (I haven't seen it yet, but I assume that it will be the case), but without life of its own. What we the fans most appreciate of the great composer is that his works can be heard as a true concert or symphony in its record edition, but Lincoln is only another good music CD.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|I'd say it's right up there with the last two episodes of season 2 in intensity. A need to see don't miss this one!
B004GYNPL2|5.0|This is a great way to keep track of all your passwords on multiple devices. It is easy to use and set up and easy to sync on multiple devices. All for free! Combine this app with Drop Box and you have an easy way to keep track of all you need on all devices. Love it!
B008BM9L72|5.0|I could say that this book had me wishing I could read  it all at once, at one sitting<br />I did not want to put it down. What a wonderful author. It is gripping from start to finish.<br />I would only recommend this to someone broad minded,or one who has experience and likes expli cite description of things so personal,<br />Once again thank you to the author
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I believe this was a great book. I have read the other books as well, fasinated by his use of the Greeks and Romans. Percy Jackson is one of my all-time favorite series. I would not put the book down. But anyways, I have to agree with some of the other reviews as well. That Piper's and Percy's point of view were not the best as they were in the other books. But, I believe I got to know Annabeth better. And Leo's point of view was interesting, and still, down-right funny. I'll find myself laughing aloud in class because he is one of the funniest characters in the book. -Sorry fans of Mr. D!- Oh well. But the one thing that discouraged me was the ending. I'm not going to spoil it. Still, I believe Rick Riordan has done it again. I believe Percy Jackson fans will find this book -And the series- Full of details, humor, thrills at every corner, and vivid pictures full of color. I believe Riordan is a great author, and always will be.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Really good book, let's you get inside his twisted brain. You also learn how he got that way, and then realize how smart, sad, and lonely he really is.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, and am glad there are two more in the set.  I enjoyed getting to know the people -- as well as sociological groupings of non-humans -- in this book.  Some fun and romance mixed in with the witches and vampires.
B002U3CCBK|4.0|This topical book provides penetrating  and often amusing insights into the workings of British government bureaucracy while tracing tensions and conflicts at<br />personal, political and scientific levels in a manner that holds the readers attention.
0316223239|4.0|A touching story told from the view of the five year character; how wonderful and unique.  The human spirit is so strong.  Great Read.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Thank you for offering this series. Revenge is an exceptional series! Keeps you on the edge of your seat! Good, so good. can hardly wait til the 2nd season. Thank you amazon so much! David stiffler
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|no issues with this app.  I like it better than another calculator app I have.  I wasn't looking for anything fancy, so I'm not  sure about any advanced features.
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|Since the track Pyramids leaked I knew I had to get this album despite the coming out letter that happens weeks after the track leaked on websites, and plus there was the album streaming preview that had all the tracks playing in full length. But before then I found his free download mixtape on a mixtape website, that was good enough held me over till I had the Channel Orange in my hand and on to my computer, then my mp3 player, and my consoles (because I don't have a music player radio). I love R&B albums with creative takes and views that don't sound like many R&B albums out there, I don't care if the artist gay or even bi, I just want to be able to enjoy it without thinking why the auto-tune, this song is way too techno for a fun song, or why is he or she got this rapper on here, they're not on the same subject matter, and are they really friends or here for the money and that's why the phone in raps? With Frank I do know why, and I have no issue with them being in there with him, can't say the same with a lot of these R&B artists, so I don't them, I rarely buy R&B albums just for that fact alone, and stick with hip hop artists I know and love but don't get radio play or even with MTV, VH1, and BET (they use to play what the others didn't play in first place and that's why they created, but now look at them in the same boat as MTV and Vh1 with lame reality shows). Now the tracks that been in my head after not listening to the album after a day or more; Sweet life, Crack rock, Pyramids, Pink Matter, Pilot Jones, Monks, Thinkin' bout you, Bad religion, Golden girl, and yes Forrest Gump, not afraid to say the track has grown on me, and Super rich kids that plays in my head a little. As you see not many or hardly any tracks get skips when I play the album, I wish there were more R&B artist with this type of hip, deep soulful personal creativity on their albums, instead of these commercial party techno, auto-tuned, whomsoever hot of the time rappers on their albums.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|This book it amazing.  I have been following this doctor for years and I am so glad he has a new book out.  I needed a little motivation to start eating a little better and this book did it.  The recipes are delicious too!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I'm hooked!  My son introduced me to Sons of Anarchy.  now...  I am addicted! THe twists and turns sure keep me guessing.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I loved this movie so much I watched it three times within five days.  Of course I remember all of the songs from the 80's featured in this musical and still listen to them today.  The performances were outstanding.  I was especially surprised with Tom Cruises' abilities.  I even enjoyed the special features which explained alot about the rock scene during the 80's and was fascinated at how this movie was made in southern Florida.  I would highly recommend this move to anyone who enjoys rock music popular during the 80's.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a verry good book that I would recomend to any one who wnats proof that here is a God.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|The part of the book that connected with me personally though was the way in which John described how he though of God in \\"72 Osaka Time\\",  that's the God I know too.<br /><br />Aside from that, the book was a truly well told story of a full life, well lived, warts and all - from a guy who inspired me to get into music, and whose band has provided the soundtrack to my life.<br /><br />Many thanks John....we'll be waiting for more chapters.
B00835UWAC|4.0|wonderful music that I'm glad too have back in my collection. not much different than the original accept the extra tracks and sounds crisper.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This book gives a great insight into the minds of cats.  Cat owners and non-cat owners alike will enjoy the short and witty poems.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Just a written book form of pron.  I was very disappointed I wasted my money.  With so many great book out there, this book and the 50 plus pages I read was a waste of time.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Found this show during summer reruns in 2012 and fell in love.  Smart, funny and quirky- my wheelhouse.  I bought the entire series just to \\"catch-up\\".  I didn't realize the DVDs would contain so many extra features.  The outtakes alone are worth the price.  They also have great cast interviews, behind the scenes featurettes and of course commentary.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I can't wait for the next book. I have always been a fan of Grisham and this book does not disapoint,I didn't want it to end so I would only read one or two chapters at a time so it could last a long time. I would love another new Grisham  book for a Christmas gift .<br /><br />Thanks from Ann :)
B006AN78XS|4.0|I saw this movie first in a small theater, on a hot summer day with a broken AC.  With the heat, it made it hard to follow, but I truly enjoyed it.<br /><br />After seeing it again on DVD, I found it a wonderful romantic comedy, that for some reason, may have been edited too quickly.  It seems the movie should have been a bit longer, to play things out just a bit.  I still loved the movie even though it had that small flaw...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is an extremely well-written book.  I love the way Markus Zusak writes, he is so descriptive.  As he described the people, places, and events, I could vividly envision them.  I highly recommend this book!
1881273873|5.0|Me and my girl-friend are reading this one and getting allot out of it. We have learned about our primary love language which for both of us is quality time, and we have learned about the other love languages of acts of service, words of encouragement, gifts, and physical touch. Chapman loads each chapter with illustrations, and stories and makes the read very interesting. This book has gotten me to think about the way I communicate with others and how to meet their love language in an effort to relate better with them. This book has also helped me realize why there are some I cannot relate with, and love language, and common interest are a primary reason. Overall a great read for singles. I can't wait to get married so I can read the married edition of this book.
B007V65R54|5.0|The best way to sum it up: be ok with uncertainty. Apply common sense to predictions. Keep testing.  Be suspect of absolutes.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have no complaints about this order.  Product is in perfect condition and arrived fast!<br />It was packaged well and I can't wait to start watching my DVD!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I enjoyed playing this on shockwave, but nothing new is added to the match 3 style play. the add the thing you found to the picture levels are pretty pointless, but they serve as a bridge between segments. was also hoping for more storyline. good as FAOTD, but think the price is extreme given the shortness of the game.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|Having read \\"The Fist of God\\" by Follet, I was really excited to read this new two book series.  But I quit reading after getting midway thru first book.  Not only was the story tediously boring, but Follet gave more details to the sex in the book than he did to the storyline.  If I wanted to read trashy romance novels, I would not have chosen Ken Follett ... but now ....

It sheds light on how a survivor of child abuse copes with life and how unconditional love can help heal the wounds.  This is an adult read that is worth purchasing.
0345803485|1.0|I purchased this book for my Kindle and I've read 10 chapters.  This book has absolutely NO story line.  All it is is pornography in print.  And, in reading some other reviews I totally agree, it sounds like it was written by teenage girls.  I rarely read a book that I can't finish but this is an exception.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is not the first one I have read on NDE but it profoundly impacted me.  With the author being a neurosurgeon you get the perspective and understanding of how the brain works and the evidence that this could not have been just a hallucination.  I'm left with the beautiful realization that I am not alone and I am \\"known\\" by a loving creator.  When I die I will transition to complete love, what an amazing way to look at death.  I also now know that this \\"love\\" is with me here while on this earth and permeates every part of my being. Read this and pass it on.

0679314784|4.0|Whenever an author decides to write a parallel narrative the potential pitfall is that one strand becomes more interesting than the other and as a reader you end up skimming half the book to always be getting at the bit of the story you want. So it is with Restless. Eva's story is just more engaging and evocative than her daughter's. The strands tie up cleverly at the end but personally I'd have been happy to have read a full 300 pages set during the war.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The DVDs were exactly what I was looking for. It was shipped quickly and packaged nicely.  It was a great value compared to what the same collection would go for in a store.
0345803485|1.0|Oh my, what utter rubbish! Where do I start? The ludicrous, teenage style writing? Cliché upon cliché? The sheer nonsense of it all (shy virgin gets swept off her feet by 'troubled' billionaire)? How this presents a 'female fantasy' so corny, absurd and misogynistic that if a man wrote it he'd be pilloried across the world rather than selling millions? It's also about as erotic as an unerotic thing on the least erotic day of the year with a headache and runny nose. Holy crap! I could go on but I wasted enough time reading the first 150 pages (the point at which I gave up) that I don't want to waste any more on a review: life really is too short. But if this is the best women's fiction has to offer, I wish I was illiterate!
B0087JTAKW|2.0|This was chosen by my book club, so I had to finish it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered. It gets better towards the end, but on the whole, this book just made me feel like I was reading a little kid's book. And some books for kids are more sophisticated than this.
B00902MCVY|5.0|I understand many Wintersun fans are disappointed by the duration or form of this cd, as it is very epic and orchestral compared to the last release. I was worried myself...until the cd arrived.<br /><br />After countless listens, it is still growing on me. Starting from the first track and moving forward, I can anticipate each track's epic delivery with powerful vocals, both sung and screamed, as well as brilliant composed portions of the songs.<br /><br />Overall, the musicianship is excellent, and this is only the FIRST HALF of the entire Time album; I can't wait to hear the next part. Regardless, this still feels like a great solo album nonetheless, and would have worked fantastically on its own.<br /><br />If you're a Wintersun fan, support them by buying this album! You won't regret it!!!
0525953728|5.0|I picked up this book and didn't put it down until i finnished it. what a great book and a must to read
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book was a well-written, engrossing analysis of the role of introversion in modern society. The author's main thesis is that introverts comprise 30-50% of the population, but are largely marginalized by societies that value gregarious, extroverted personalities (despite evidence that this is not a beneficial prejudice). As an introvert, I connected well with the stories presented by Cain and could relate to many of the conclusions drawn, having experienced many of the same pressures to be extroverted throughout my life. Extroverts should also read this book, if only to gain an understanding of the quiet, reserved person that probably sits beside them everyday.<br /><br />Worth every penny.
B005KELW26|5.0|I really like my Belkin cover for my kindle it protects it keeps it clean and makes it easy to find.
B008ENA74E|5.0|This book is well written and represents a compelling and disturbing account of Wall Street and the banking industry from the inside. It explains in detail why the author was compelled to turn away from potential great wealth and comfort because of his upholding of common decency, honesty and basic belief in the moral and ethical standards that seem to be disappearing among those who influence our elected officials.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|With all the fuzz about this series and after reading some reviews that actually made me laugh (one said and I quote \\"is so bad that is god\\"), I asked a friend to lend it to me so I could read them.<br />I'm still to read the last part but I agree that the author still has a way to go, sometimes you feel like you lost a page in between so a good editor would have been appreciated.<br />Also, I believe the author likes Grey's Anatomy too much; the characters go through so much that is against all odds.<br />But I as I say in my title if you are aware of what kind of reading you are getting yourself into then is something you can enjoy, the characters are like teenagers even when they are past 20, so is like a young adult book with a lot of sex.<br />Definitely find someone that you can borrow these books from since I believe $10 each is excessive for this, $3-5 could do better but then we live in a world when publicity makes the difference and this book had plenty of it.

B0088EDMMS|5.0|We have watched this every year since it came out the month leading up to Halloween. Loved the 2 disc set!
0316228532|5.0|You probably won't know how good this book is until you finish the final page.  It's awesome.  Such realistic characters.  Some of the scenes are just pure magic they are written so well.  Its a very sad story but very very good. Krystal Weedon was a great character.  Jo is an amazing writer!<br />Listening to Umbrella by Rihanna now makes me think of Krystal and her little brother.  I hope this song plays during the end credits if they make a movie! :)
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun, enjoyable, maze game. It does keep you busy if your waiting in a Doctor's Office or waiting for your ride. I don't think it is something you could be addicted to, but grateful it's on your Kindle when you need something to do.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|The stories were good especially Cielo Azul since it fills in to the reference in one of the Bosch books about Cielo Azul.  It was good to know a bit more about the whole story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It will keep you turning page to page.  This book is worth every penny.  It will make you stay up to read it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have watched the first series by episode. I purchased the second series. I consider the two seasons the best television I have watched in years. The British know how to do it right. I can't wait for the third season to start. I probably will buy the third season even though it will be on PBS.
B008KWHM6U|3.0|I like the band, and they continue to put out good music.  I am a bit disappointed with this effort, as it's just not the real force Tourist History was. Mixing and production are OK, and better than TH, which was too bass-heavy.  Hoping for something better next time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|No problem picking up from Book One. Can't wait for the Third Book. I love historical fiction - Follett delivers once again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a typical John Grisham book with a great plot, well written, entertaining with a very interesting finish.  Well worth the read in my opinion.
0142428280|5.0|I have read every Follett book. This book is Follett at his typical best. I most enjoyed his character development.There are a large number of characters to remember but Follett brings them together so you won't forget who is who.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|This is a perfect mix of hits with a new edge on some classics. Paul Simon is a perfectionist and this performance is slick, multi-layered and without fault. I am so often transported to another space by the creativity of such true talents (He surrounds himself with mighty fine artists). Thank-you again Paul. Just love to love you.
1423140605|5.0|I bought this gift for a friend who was in her early teens and she absolutely loved it. It's humorous (even for teens), action packed and has many interesting characters. Greek and Roman mythology in weaved into the story so you'll learn while enjoying the book.
B004I1K2NW|4.0|While I recommend this film to the \\"tween\\" and up age groups, the plot may be a bit over the head of the younger folks. That said, it is a hoot and a half even if you don't understand the intricacies of the plot (not that the plot's genius...just somehwhat convoluted/involved).<br /><br />The Frighteners is dark comedy or humorous horror movie, depending on your take.<br /><br />Michael J Fox is a paranormal investigator who is legitimate, but he scams people by having ghosts he works with haunt houses so he can get a paycheck for \\"cleansing\\" them.<br /><br />His wife was killed in a car accident under suspicious circumstances and he has never forgiven himself and the police still suspect he was somehow involved.<br /><br />Events soon start happening that lead him to believe that his wife was murdered and the murderer was a ghost.<br /><br />The film is essentially about him trying to solve the mystery of her murder and stop additional murders along the way.<br /><br />There are plot elements that involve Charlie Starkweather and his rampage and an extension of similar in the plot.<br /><br />The film is raucous fun, but you do need to pay attention to what's going on, because several different sub-plot lines are running tangent to the main one.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away as this is a fun film to watch on a stormy night to give you just a bit of the creeps and quite a few laughs.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, and if that isn't enough this was one of Peter Jackson's (Lord of the Rings trilogy, King Kong, The Hobbit) first films.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I found the book concept interesting however it would take a veritable genius to concoct such a complicated plot with so many places where it could go wrong. I found it too far fetched.  If I was looking for a James Bond type novel it would have been ok.
B006DZYM0A|1.0|I cannot get this DVD to play on any of my 4 DVD players in the house. Not sure what is wrong but I need to send this back for a replacement or refund. That's why it gets a one=star.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in you was better then Bared to You!  I couldn't keep my eyes off my kindle.  Every time I got a chance to read a few pages I took it.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|it needs more demo time for like a hour but it is fun because I'm still trying to build my manor.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Ienjoyed the first four books, but the last one I got so tired of the endless row of names that attende<br />any type of gathering. There didn't seem to be any decisive ending. I imagine that he intends to write<br />another in the series. I won't read it. He left the Others in never-never land. He left Bran the watchman<br />fora dying religion. Sansa in the hands of a lecher. Goody-goody Dana crawling in the grass while she has<br />three of the most powerful weapons of that time at her disposal. So much more fog. Sorry.
B008VBYN80|3.0|In my opinion, this is a very fun game. But, after awhile it kinda starts to get boring and you have to pay real money  for a game.  Fun game but can get boring after awhile
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is just that. A joy ride taken via my Kindle Fire. I love this game. Very easy to play and get addicted to.
B001W2I9Y4|5.0|This cd was what got me into Mastodon. I hadn't listened to them much beforehand, but after listening to this album a bunch I bought their subsequent cd's, Live at the Aragon and The Hunter, and then some of their older stuff and I love it all. I can't say that Mastodon is my number one favorite band, but Crack the Skye is easily my favorite album of all time. Why? it's masterful use of layered vocals, complex chords and varying rhythms, and a compelling story.
B007EECSFA|5.0|If you want a good read that involves fascinating characters and seemingly endless twists and turns as to whether the mystery will be solved or not, this is the book for you. Though the author at times goes a bit off the deep end describing surroundings and events, on the whole she brilliantly keeps your interest by changing circumstances and developing characters that keep you guessing and thinking, \\"what's next!\\" As a young girl, the central character witnesses her Mother killing a stranger who stopped by their country home. Thus begins the search by the daughter for an explanation of her Mother's fearsome act; why did she do it and who was this stranger to her Mother? The efforts to unlock the secret or secrets of her Mother's action carry us back to the early stages of WW II in London to the present, and the skill with which the author engages the characters in this search is remarkable, intriguing and exciting. I need say no more, except, read it and enjoy the adventure.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Once again, a Grisham book I could not put down.  A bit different than his normal, but I loved it!! Just read it!!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|lil slow to start but gets addictive quick.  haven't played Oregon trail since elementary school...glad there is still plenty of disentary for everyone.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This movie has a great idea behind it, and it starts out as a very innovative and eye catching movie. Then about halfway through, it just gets super weird. Random things start happening and the entire movie spirals downward from there. Promise me, don't waste your time watching it.
B007EECSFA|4.0|As a reader, I think that the first chapter of a book really sets the stage for a novel.  In the Secret Keeper I was blow away by how beautifully it was written and then left reeling by the last sentence of the chapter.  From there the story just got better and better.  The story flips from past to present, setting the stage for twists and turns, great characters and an amazing story.  It novel is a must read and I rate it 4.5 stars.
B009ESIGHI|1.0|I know someone at the studio thinks the song is slow and drags down the film but it is a pretty song and my VHS tape of it and my first DVD copy of it (in full screen format) has the song.  WHY would they cut out such a scene from what is supposed to be a 20th aniversary version?!<br /><br />Save your money and buy an older copy, the version from a few years ago that has the option for wide screen or full screen format contains the missing song in it's full screen format.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Another good album from aerosmith. Best since their 80's albums. This new record seems more 80s but it has crunchy songs too like 70's aerosmith did. Great work and anyone who would rate this album under 3 stars is no aerosmith fan and is just begging to be a critic.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Although similar to Where's My Water, my kids love this game because they adore Phineas And Ferb on Disney.  We would recommend this app for problem solving skills.
