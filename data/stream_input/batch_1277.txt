B003BKF696|2.0|Saw this group on Austin City Limits and was drawn to their music -- a bit unusual for a 67-year old, conservative man with eclectic musical taste. I particulary like \\"Squalor Victoria\\" and \\"About Today\\", neither of which is here.  On the jacket, it states that the first two songs were recorded in a basement.  The sound reproduction supports that.  I have never sent a CD back for a refund and probably won't do it this time -- but, I've certainly considered doing just that.
0316056863|3.0|As someone who has always been a fan of Tina Fey's, I picked up this book knowing it would be laugh out loud funny. And it was. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. But, after it was finished, I realized I knew a lot about Tina Fey, but I didn't really know Tina Fey. Some might say, how can you really know someone just by reading a book? Well, I have read some amazing autobiographies where, towards the end, I really felt like I had made a new friend. And this just wasn't one of them. It's too bad, because Tina Fey went through a lot to get where she is. She really worked her way up in showbiz which makes for a great story. She wrote a book about her entire life, but I would have rather her take pieces of her life and go more in depth with them.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Love this app..Agenda view is my main setup so I can see all of my weekly tasks at a glance!
B0064BCNA4|3.0|It is surprising that it doesn't show chords and chord names.  that seems like it should be a basic feature.
B005LAJ16I|3.0|Homeland was a great series that began well. Each week there was more intense drama non-stop; however, the last two episodes were not the best. An okay series, but there's too many cliffhangers at the end, so I won't be watching season 2. This would have been a great mini-series.
B006FE3FFC|3.0|Season 1 was absolutely awesome, and I could hardly wait for Season 2 to start.<br />What really got me about the first season is the mix of a human drama with a little zombie apocalypse - lots of tension without relying on gore. Season 2 ... I'm seriously 1 or 2 more yawners away from canceling my season pass. I can not believe how long they drug out this whole Sophia missing / life on the farm thing. Each episode seems to have about 1 interesting thing occur, with about 40 minutes of filler. And to be honest, I wouldn't mind the filler if it was helping establish a character, but it fails to do even that. We still know very little about any of the character's past;  we still know extremely little about the events that lead up to the apocalypse or how far it's even spread. It's starting to feel like AMC is living into the title of the show and is delivering something dead on its feat.
B0064BCNA4|5.0|I don't understand the low reviews some are giving.  the app does exactly what it says it does.  there are no bugs and its quick to load and incredibly simple to use.  one Guy said he got bored...I'm not really sure what he was expecting from this app...its a piano all it does is play the notes you press!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app! It gives very accurate hour by hour forecasts. The only issue is it tries to run even when no wi-fi signal is present. I would still recommend as a free app.
B0064BCNA4|1.0|Gives no indication of timing when playing &quot;melodies&quot;. For example how do you know how many times a note is repeated? You don't. Do I hit it three times? Foit times? Fine for free, but x don't recommend buying.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Dexter is excellent, no matter whether the first or the fifth season.  So spellbinding, I do a 20 hour marathon.
B000295SH4|5.0|Thanks for sending this album in record time. The album is absolutely fantastic. I always followed Donna Summer. I have a few other albums of hers. This one is really special, What i would like to maybe hear is the songs Hot Stuff and Bad Girls syncronised as in the original album but it is still fantastic. I would recommend this to any person that likes dance music and an awesome voice. I now need to find a DVD of Donna Summer that matches this album in sound and quality.<br />When are you commin to South Africa?
B005H0IW6W|5.0|What can you say about Michael Buble......wondeful and sweet and very romantic! This is a great CD with a lot of the Christmas favorites and you know that Michael has to put his touch to them! You will love it!

B002LMV7TS|5.0|I loved this movie since it came out. We made it a holiday tradition to watch it every Christmas. The combo pack was perfect for our household. Great Classic!
B001EN71DG|1.0|This was released for the die-hards who can't live their lives because of the additions made in the 1990's. So what do you get? Non-standard letterbox (these are NOT made for today's television standards and look just as bad on full screen TV's). Grainy picture, especially on the original movies. 2 channel sound on the originals and no bonus discs whatsoever. Your better off watching the original VHS tapes if you want Han Solo to shoot first that badly. (If your a die hard).  The reviews here on Amazon are laughable and the quality transfers on this set are a joke. Don't waste a dime on this unless your a Star Wars fan that can't do without a DVD copy of the originals. But why? Better to buy the masterful blu-rays and skip the added scenes manually or go back to the VHS tapes.   This set is a complete joke.  I watched the Star Wars blu rays last night. Skipped a few added scenes and was happy.
B0064BCNA4|4.0|This is a reasonably functional piano keyboard. I think it works well for someone who has never played before and would like to follow along with the blue song keys. The other instrument sounds need a lot of work as the quality is pretty bad on a few (like the trumpet), but all in all it is something a kid might find fun. Even an adult might find it entertaining for a moment or two. There are a couple of short Christmas tunes and it's that time of year.
B004LUS390|2.0|Has potential, but crashes every time when importing picture from Gallery (Nexus S 4G). Others are reporting frequent crashes, too.
0316010669|5.0|This book is an amazing read! Very informative and thought-provoking, and force self evaluation of the traits discussed within. The company shipped it out on time, and it was in great condition. They performed as they said they would!
B0064BCNA4|2.0|The Multitouch support is poor.  It seems to kind of work with two keys if you don't press them at the exact time, but that is horrible. The sound effects are not great either. This feels like an app someone made one afternoon while bored at work or something. Should not be a paid app.
B003JTHSE0|5.0|This is great story. It is better than the movie. Used in my high school literature class. They loved it too.
B0064BCNA4|4.0|We love it!  Don't think it is for learning, but it is very fun! I know my kids will love playing on it!
B0064BCNA4|2.0|Disclaimer: Got it as the free app of the day on the Kindle Fire  I have to say, I was surprised at the problems with this app, even for 99 cents. It wasn't much fun to try and play songs or to follow along with it: the only joy I had was in banging on the keys as quickly as I can. That loses its appeal rather quickly.  Pro:  + The piano and piano (old) voices sound nice  + Keyboard works OK for the most part. I can even slide my finger up and down the keyboard and have the notes play!  + Plays OK if you're just fiddling around and not trying to make a melody  Con:  - Hard to play a tune which has a fast rhythm to it.   - Different instruments have uneven volume. For example, when I switch from piano to guitar, I can't hear guitar whereas at the same volume I could hear the piano just fine.   - 'Play along' mode is very abrupt in transition to new note, especially when following multiple instances of the same note. I had trouble being able to play the song at the right rhythm, and telling which keys came next.  - Misspellings and inconsistent capitalization in the song list. I was surprised by this as it's basic quality control, makes me wonder what else was missed.  - Keyboard drawing is simple rectangles in my version, almost looks like an abstract piano. It would have been trivial to make it look a little nicer, matching its icon.  Overall I don't think this is the piano app I want on my fire. I'm going to delete it and keep looking.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I couldn't play this on my OG and now that I have a Nexus, it's no better. If it opens, it goes for a minute or two and freezes up. I expected better from someone like popcap.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|\\"Here and Now\\" is a perfect blend of the old and the new. If you liked the slower ballads from previous releases you'll find something to like on this one. If you preferred the hard driving stuff, there's plenty of that, too. There's even a touch of a new sound for the group. I love every cut.
0807014265|5.0|This book is profound and offers the reader much to ponder.  Viktor Frankl's intellect is evident as well as his compassion.  The spritual nature of the work is quite moving.  This book offers an insightful view into a place and subject impossible to comprehend.  I thank Dr. Frankl for his wisdom and sharing.  Through this book, he has been able to bring deep meaning out of incredible suffering and tragedy.  This is a rare accomplishment.
B0064BCNA4|2.0|That is to say: nothing.  doesn't really do much and certainly has nothing to justify a &quot;pro&quot; tag.  already uninstalled.
B004SIP7AS|1.0|I love this movie, which is why I ordered it from Amazon.  Twice.  Each time it was defective (some scenes impossible to turn off captions/subtitles).  Gave up and asked for a refund.  Just FYI.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Just great! Very addictive. Once you start you don't want to put it down. Easy to follow levels. Easy to download. Have had problems with some other Apps but this one is mahvelous, Darling!!
B0064BCNA4|3.0|Limited as all other reviewers state.  The play along *is* a little annoying without shading keys for duration, sequence, etc.  i would forgive all that in a free app, but this one consistenly force closes on D2.  Seems to happed if i try to play a chord of W keys.
B002VPE1PW|4.0|Overall it works. Little loose. For the price you just can't go wrong. Pick one up to keep your tablet dry!
B0064BCNA4|3.0|superman 75 you like many others are searching for something to whine about, and point out why you are different and the sad injustice of the world. I am sure the release of a simple piano app has NOTHING to do with helen Keller good or bad. I know we all want to feel important but forcing the matter makes a person look petty and childish save. save reviews for ACTUAL reviews.  btw my children LOVED the app they have a great time experiancing the ability to create a musical reaction from a simple action.

B005ZKYXZI|4.0|Going to movies and watching trailers of this movie and seeing the promos on TV I really wanted to hate this movie. But after theater hopping into this flick I have to say it really was quite good. I am always a scifi fan and there is very little science to this movie other than the fact that it has robots in it the story was actually quite good. The final fight really had me rooting for the underdog (the father) who learns what it means to have a son. Four stars because of the lack of science in the fiction.<br /><br />Why are there robot boxers? Is there robot football? Robot MMA? Robot mini-golf?

I love Arya and Dany. And Needle.<br />Get this book!!!
0385534639|3.0|THE NIGHT CIRCUS kept me entertained...till about the last 1/4 of the book. The concept of the circus and competing characters was unique and intriguing. And while I loved part of the development of the multiple storylines, the characters and the competition, there were several times I grew frustrated, wanting to say \\"just get on with it.\\" But the last several \\"chapters\\" of the book, to me, just fell apart and dragged on. What started out as a compelling and intriguing read became annoying and disappointing. While I don't regret the read, I'm also not sure I would recommend it to friends.

0439023491|4.0|After finishing Book 1: The Hunger Games I couldn't wait to get my hands on Book 2: Catching Fire. How would our hero (a strong-willed, strategic, smart, cunning, independent teen) deal with being a teen in love while staying true to herself? The most interesting part of reading these books is how I CANNOT stop reading once I start. It baffles me. The writing style does not let you rest. Some have commented that Book 2 is \\"slow\\" in the middle. I see where they're coming from: there was a section in the middle where I felt \\"safe\\" putting the book down and going to sleep (I read both books in less than 24 hours). For Book 1 there was no point at which I felt \\"safe\\" and I had to tear myself away.<br /><br />For parents, I would be willing to read this book WITH my child. In my opinion there are important topics children need guidance on such as teen marriage, totalitarian government, teenagers of opposite sex sleeping in bed together (but no other intimacy), teen pregnancy and public displays of affection. I would recommend this book to teen girls especially. There are so few female heroes with \\"real\\" personality. I especially enjoy how Katniss (the hero) contemplates how the pressures society puts on her make her feel and what she can do to combat those concerns.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I'm challenged trying to find earphones that stay in and project the sound well into the ear.  As a runner I've never been able to use earbuds at all, don't get it. They don't stay in!! The latest product that actually loops over the ear is an improvement but the sound quality is compromised.  I've actually been using these Sony headphones for years but could no longer find them in the usual discount retailers.  They fit into the ear opening and the sound is not lost in the airspace between ear canal and device.  The headset is adjustable yet slim lined and lightweight so it's comfortable under a headband or cap.  They stay in the ear and snuggly over the head.  And the sound is great.  My only complaint is I have to replace them about once a year.  The sound just stops working or gets very static and buzzy in one of the earpieces.  Sony says on a performance waiver with the product that wearing clothing not made of natural materials increases static electricity and can effect product performance. The ones I purchased from Amazon cost less than half what I used to pay in Walmart or Target so I'm happy about that.  So thrilled in fact that I bought two pair at once and may buy 2 more very soon!!  Sony,  PLEASE don't stop making this product!!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Super 8 is a movie that's very fun to watch, with very believable characters. I didn't know what to expect! A rarity these days.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I upgraded from the corded ones and have never looked back! love having the freedom to go where I want without having to worry about the cord, the distance is amazing even through walls walked across my house and even with doors shut and walls between me and the computer it was clear as day reception.
B005K8QIS0|5.0|Once again in reading the reviews on this board and following an Amazon recommendation, I have \\"discovered\\" another great British (in very grey Edinburgh, Scottland) detective series with six (6) episodes on two (2) discs with each episode being about an hour in length.<br /><br />The series \\"Case Histories\\" is splendid.  With wonderful writing, direction and fabulous acting, I love this series.  Jason Isaacs is really tremendous as the \\"super jock\\"(but still puffs away on his cigarettes), tough guy \\"with a heart\\"  and very randy, private investigator, Jackson Brodie that cases seem to find him or he seems always to \\"find\\" really horrendous cases while investigating some rather mundane things (i.e., a lost cat, wife cheating on husband, etc. ) or he himself having terrible experiences such as being run over by a train. I enjoyed all of the characters in this series--the acting by all is tremendous (I especially adored Brodie's sassy and insubordinate secretary/receptionist)<br /><br />If you want to \\"curl up\\" in front of the TV with some very good entertainment, get this series.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|This movie is truly a gem that demands multiple viewings. The director did a magnificent job as did the personnel involved in casting. Kudo's all around for everyone involved in the making of this film.<br />Please don't simply take the movie as popcorn fodder. Ask yourself some questions about the true nature of the relationship between Eli and Oskar. Is it an intimate (as possible), friendship or is it a cold and calculated servile relationship in development? My take leans heavily toward the latter.<br />The English language remake, \\"Let Me In\\", is incredibly inferior in every respect and only barely worth viewing. The dubbed version of this film is inferior to the sub-titled version and that opinion is from someone who usually finds subtitles annoying at best.<br />Just a great movie that is hard to review without ruining the film for first time viewers. The movie is truly a \\"must see\\".
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Great transaction.  Arrived quickly.  Packaged well.  It was an Awescome movie.  If you love Gerard Butler movies then you should watch this one.
1451627289|5.0|I am always leery whenever a book contains as many pages as this, especially from an author known for the totally bizarre.  Do not be afraid.  11/22/63 is a smoothly flowing, character centered, fantasy with a realistic tone and satisfying ending that exceeded my expectations.  I have seen criticism that the book is too heavy on details of the characters' lives.  Could it have been shortened? Yes. Should it have been? Absolutely not. These details and the stories within stories make it such an enjoyable read.  I was able to put it down, but couldn't wait to pick it up again.  Hurry though, Christmas is almost here and it would make a great gift for a reader on your list.  Or just treat yourself.
B005IZLPME|4.0|Is Captain America: The First Avenger perfect? No. Is it the best live-action interpretation of the character? You betcha! In fact, of all the Avenger movies, this one is my favorite so far (though I DO love all of them). For those that like storylines, I would recommend watching this film first, then Iron-Man, then Incredible Hulk, then Iron-Man 2, then Thor. This film makes those other four make more sense as there are clues and elements (and character links) that show up in those movies that are shown here.  On the film itself, I found it to be dramatic fun! The 3D effects in it I found satisfactory as well as the bonus features. I loved this film in the movies and I like it here. Would recommend the film itself no matter the format!
B0064BCNA4|5.0|Refuses to install on my Droid X . Disappointing since I really wanted to try this out. Re-install option proved useless as well.
1439192812|5.0|This book is not only wonderful in its clarity on evolution, and is good for anyone of any age, it's particularly fun and well done in the iPad app! Unlike the paper versions, the iPad app is interactive, where you can breed frogs, see the gradual change in evolution. Illustrations move, the book asks you questions, and throughout is Richard's delightful voice explaining the details of evolution.<br /><br />I like the way he started each chapter with a myth. Religious people, of course, may find this offensive, as they don't realize their beliefs are myths. But myths they are, and then Richard details what we have learned about the beauty of the real world.<br /><br />Excellent to read. This is not just a book for children. I've been studying evolution for a few decades, and I learned a few new things in this book. I had some misconceptions that Richard cleared up.<br /><br />This book is really well done. I recommend getting the iPad app version if you can. But if you can't the book is beautifully done, and the text in both are awesome.
B0064BCNA4|4.0|Fun little app. Don't see why it doesn't deserve all stars. Perfect for entertaining small children. Not ideal for the hardcore pianist.

B005H0IW6W|2.0|Wow, I really like Michael Buble. I usually enjoy his music choices, style and arrangement but this Christmas album simply doesn't do it for me. I read an interview with Buble and he said that this would be his only Christmas album. He spent over six months working on it and it is exactly the Christmas album he dreamed of making. While I'm certainly glad to see an artist at a point in their career where they can make the album they want to make, as opposed to an album put together by a label or the producers, but in this case I think that Michael's album might have been much better with a bit more input from others. Some of the songs are simply boring and lacking in anything even remotely festive, joyful or, if you will, \\"Christmasy\\". His version of \\"All I Want For Christmas (Is You)\\" is a snooze fest. I try to avoid comparison between artists but I honestly don't think I've ever heard this song done with so little imagination and creativity (give the \\"Puppini Sisters\\" version a listen if you want something lively and truly different from Mariah Carey's original).<br /><br />All of these Christmas songs have all been done before and, in my mind, better. And please, \\"Santa Buddy\\" isn't nearly as clever as I'm sure it must have sounded when the decision was made to include it. To his credit the album certainly isn't over produced - no over the top arrangements or backup singers drowning out the lead vocals. But the CD honestly sounds like something you might have heard in an old fashioned cocktail lounge - pleasant enough background music but nothing exciting enough to make you want to stop your conversation and listen. I honestly hope that Buble isn't true to his word and that this isn't his only Christmas CD. Michael is often compared to Frank Sinatra and might be well advised to take a listen to some of Sinatra's Christmas recordings - they have style, they swing and they don't put you to sleep. I kind of feel bad that I opted for the more expensive version of the CD (with three bonus songs) because they don't add anything to what I consider a pretty lackluster CD. I know it's the #1 album in the USA but I can't help but think there are a lot of Buble fans who were expecting more than they got and, like me, hope there is a better holiday album in his future. If you've already bought it and you love it then I'm totally happy for you but for me I expected more, wanted more and am disappointed with what I got. Anyone reading my other reviews will see that I rarely rate anything less than 4 stars because I usually know before I buy what to expect but this time the CD is a 2 star disappointment for me.hree bonus songs) because they don't add anything to what I consider a pretty lackluster CD.

B005HT400A|5.0|This is the best black and white film ever made in color.  The movie opens with a disembodied ear.  David Lynch is telling you to listen, as well as watch.  The soundtrack manipulates the mind as much as the images themselves.
B0064BCNA4|4.0|Nice for people who are new to the piano, although isn't quite as sensitive as I thought... I tried to do a chord, but failed because of the sensitivity going numb. That is my only complaint, though! Otherwise has nice song options and I agree, it does pass the time!

B000003N7F|5.0|This vinyl pressing of Coltrane's classic album is simply amazing.  If you have only heard this record (or much of the great late 50's to 70's jazz stuff) digitally, you will be amazed at the warmth of the audio on vinyl.  Get a record player and listen to this stuff in natural analog...it is stunning.

B0051MKNV8|4.0|Spoiler Ahead!  I watched this with my friends in the theatre. The plot and the acting keep me interested from the beginning till the end. It's about a wonder drug that enable people to recall everything they saw. They're able to master everything such as a new language after looking at TV for a couple of minutes! Wow! Of course, people can get rich quickly with that ability. The best thing about this movie is the amazing camera tricks. They effectively portray the effects of the drug that happen to Eddie, the main character.  It also frighteningly shows the side effects of the drug. It strongly reminds me drug is a death trap. In the end, Eddie said he had got rid of the drug. However, he still had that magical mental ability. I doubted his sincerity. The ending was open because it did not give any clue that Eddie's statement was true.   In short, it's one the BEST movies released in 2011 in terms of thriller.

As I ease into this new (to me lol) digital territory, I was pleased to discover that Ever Note is a built in option for sharing a site on my Stumble Upon app.  I am now curious to see how else I can use it.  An easy to use app with hidden depth and ease?  I wish they were all this useful.
B000SEGHT6|5.0|Well, true to my word I gave Vonnegut a second try with \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" after being unimpressed with \\"Sirens of Titan\\" and I'm very glad I did. I found \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" very enjoyable and actually plan to read it again. His look at war through the eyes of the unlikely Billy Pilgrim was great and took me by surprise as we've come to expect the hero in a war (or anti-war) tale to be filled with machismo. After finishing \\"S5\\" I was glad I'd chose to read \\"Sirens\\" first. Although the two do not have much in common I felt I had a little more understanding of Vonneguts views of time and space and spirituality.I also felt I had a better understanding of Tralfamadorian teaching and I also enjoyed the nod to the Rumsfoord family.Great book.I'm now looking forward to Cat's Cradle.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|When I saw the trailer , I said to myself \\"Nonsense. It's going to be a bad movie.\\" How wrong I was!  The plot sounded unorthodox at first. Cowboys versus Aliens? How absurd it was. Then, I realized cowboys were just fantasy in Hollywood films just like aliens. Real-life cowboys, in their period, did not behave as the Hollywood ones. After this shift in thinking, I enjoyed watching it.  It showed that bad people were not always bad. Also, it proved \\"United we Stand, Divided we Fall\\". It did those things in a subtle way, not preaching.  Paul Dano was one of the reasons I liked this picture. His acting as the son of cattle baron Woodrow (Harrison Ford) was so convincing that I really hated his character!  The fighting scenes were quick, deadly and interesting. The special effects of aliens looked scary. However the spaceship looked generic. Of course, I had to suppress my logic to be entertained.  It did add spices to Western genre.
0440241901|5.0|I adored this one! Emma spills all her secrets to a stranger on a plane when she thinks they're about to die- then he turns out to be the millionaire head of the company she works for. The rest of the story is well paced and enjoyable. Emma was a very likable and easy to relate to character and I definitely found myself hoping things would work out for her. The writing is light and witty and the book is impossible to put down. It was a very fun read and definitely on par with Kinsella's Shopaholic books.
B0064BCNA4|4.0|its not bad for a piano on a kindle... I learner some songs I didn't know from it! and to the deaf guy- not everyone is deaf, so amazon doesn't just have to cater to you. you complaining about this app is like me complaining that there are golf games when i don't play golf... grow up...
B0064BCNA4|5.0|The best part of these free apps are the reviews. The drama, the passion, the ignorance... Beautiful.  App is good enough for free.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|I watched this with my friend in the theatre. There are some hilarious scenes. For example, the scene where it looked like Paul was going to cure the injured bird but he....  The dialogue is funny in many scenes. However, most of the times it's not suitable for children.   It's worth watching once.
159448385X|5.0|I really enjoyed every second of this book. I was wondering if Hosseini could manage to do better than The Kite Runner, and he really did, The Kite Runner was a wonderful book, but A Thousand Splendid Suns is in an entirely different league.  It follows the story of two Afghan women, and the hardships they are faced with in every aspect of their lives. The two women, Mariam and Laila experience very different childhoods.  Mariam is a harami, an illegitimate child. She sees her father once a week, and her mother is cold and bitter towards her most of the time. One day, Mariam runs off to find her father, and when she comes back the next day, her mother has committed suicide. Mariam is ''given'' to a man much older than her, who turns against her when she is unable to carry a child to full term.  Laila, on the other hand, comes from a much better off family, with very well educated parents. Her father has plans for her to go to university and get a proper job. However, both her parents are killed in a bombing, and Laila ends up marrying the same man Mariam is married too. Laila rushes into marrying this man for the mere fact that she is six weeks pregnant with her friend's child, and needs to hide it.  The story that follows is heartbreaking. It shows the life of two very strong women, who keep fighting against all the odds. Every page is interesting, and every event shocking. It very much deserves five stars.

B000JML90Y|4.0|Okay, a free download can't be passed over, and Darwin's original work is still readable today as it was in 1859.  While lacking the original visual diagrams included in his original work (and printed copies today), the OCR text is clean, readable, and lacks the usual typos seen in other free downloaded Kindle ebooks.  Downloaded for an Android smartphone, I can bookmark and annotate the text very easily, and pull up sections for reference when needed during lecture.  With this free Kindle version, students can also read it when needed on their Kindle, smartphone, or other e-media supported devices for use in a biology class. I'd rate the app higher if the diagrams were included, but you can always google the diagrams and see them online.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|i loved, LOVED, LOVEEDD this book. I bought it while ago think that it wouldn't be a very good book, and i decided that i should read it to get it out of my kindle. i could not put this book down, it took me 3 days (but i only read it at night) I was wrong about this book, it was amazing, i felt my heart pound for Travis, like even i want him! This book made me hope that when i go to college in 2 years, that i will find a guy like Travis! A guy that will love be forever and break down without me there, its amazing but i hope its not a fairy tale wish.   I recommend this book, like you will not regret paying $3, it will be the best $3 you have ever spent.
0061689246|5.0|There are a lot of faerie stories out there, and most of them rely on hoary conventions, coincidence, or random magic to get from start to finish. Plot coherence is usually the first casualty of the effort.<br /><br />  Well, this is the most entertaining, coherent, satisfying, \\"tie-up-all-the-loose-ends\\", alls-well-that-ends-well, adventure story that I've ever read in the genre. Humor, romance, excitement, multiple plot threads and sub-plots, engaging characters, and not a hint of the twee or precious.<br /><br />  I like everything that Gaiman, (in his own words), \\"makes up and writes down\\", but this particular effort should appeal to everyone.
B000VBP38C|1.0|This DVD format (HD) will not play on a regular dvd player or bluetooth dvd player. You have to own or buy a HD format DVD player, which if you don't already own one, they no longer make any more.  Great movie but the HD format is obsolete.

B0067QPVJ6|3.0|While the movie itself is enjoyable, it suffers from a few problems.<br /><br />Continuity: The fact that the ship is not unearthed and that Kate and the snowcats exist so close to the ship is a major continuity problem. They have also retconned the character \\"Jans Bolon\\" into \\"Lars\\". However, most of the rest of the movie does a nice job of setting up the continuity for Carpenter's The Thing. They worked in the key aspects of Carpenter's movie into the credits. Including Lars chasing Jed in the copter, which leads directly into Carpenter's film.<br /><br />CGI: This movie suffers some serious problems with CGI monsters. They look too cartoony to really be taken seriously. They were, in fact, used to replace practical effects that would have worked a lot better.<br /><br />Characters: Kate is a very weak hero. Her response to finding the bathroom painted with blood? Pull the other woman aside and casually mention it to her, but not tell anyone else. And her idea for a test? Check people's fillings, because it's unthinkable that someone could have good oral hygiene. They did, however do a rather good job with Lars, who takes on a roll more like MacReady. He wants nothing more than to exterminate the Things.

0679736646|5.0|Philip Dick's books are full of brilliant ideas; more great ideas per page than anything else I've encountered.  Then, taking things to the next level of complexity, he follows the ideas down paths that aren't obvious, and introduces twists and turns and keeps the reader guessing at to what's going to happen next.  This book, which deals with virtual realities and with telepathic warfare, exhibits his brilliance as well as any and is a treasure.

B00003CY5J|1.0|Advertised as being 'Widescreen' format. What ever that means! Zero stars to Amazon for not advertising the actual aspect ratio.  They (the people who reproduce movies to DVD) can call any thing that is not 1.33:1 aspect ratio (fullscreen)-'Widescreen'. This was one of those DVDs I had to just gamble it would be 2.40:1 or the like and not that 16X9 (1.78:1) which has become a bad habbit of DVD producers more and more to edit the movie to fit onto modern TVs - 16X9 - to keep the black top and bottom bars from being there. I think most people do not realize that doing that, their widescreen movies are NOT really widescreen or at least they are not reproduced in their OAR (original aspect ratio) and are missing the far left and right parts of the movie just so the black bars are not present. Actually until TVs are made in 2.40:1 (for every heigth measurement there will be 2.40 widths to the screen.) That would be like 32\\"X10\\" or some thing (sorry, not a math person), that's not likely to ever become a reality. I just don't see the black bars when I watch the movie and am satisfied I am getting what the original producers and artists intended me to see when they made it. Any way, lol, this DVD shows on the back of the box \\"Widescreen Version Enhanced for 16:9 TVs\\". Shrug??? it is actually 2.35:1 or 2.40:1. This is the actual aspect ratio and stating the \\"Widescreen Version Enhanced for 16:9 TVs\\" is just misleading and isn't even acurate as 16:9 = 1.78:1 not what it actually 2.40:1. There seems to be no industry standard for the use of the term \\"Widscreen\\" in the DVD making industry. It becomes confusing to those who are into unedited/uncensored movies.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I've read several reviews that rate the new Blu-ray set poorly, After viewing them, I don't understand why. The video is good for an older set of movies, but the sound is outstanding.

0553801473|4.0|I was very wary about starting \\"A Dance with Dragons\\", mostly owing to the negative reviews I've read here. I'm nearly 700 pages in and I'm more glad I started than not. Yes, there are still some serious loose ends to tie up that may or may not happen in the next 400 or so pages, but overall I've enjoyed the book a great deal. I think the storytelling has been generally crisp and the end of each chapter leaves me wanting to know what happens next.<br /><br />Is it the best of the series? No. But it's not the runt of the litter, either.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Martin has painted such a big space, it's hard to keep all the characters straight.<br /><br />In my opinion, it's a solid 4 stars.
B001TH7GT6|3.0|These cables seem to be sturdy (almost too sturdy for the job), and do what they are supposed to do.  Since the cables are highly inflexible, they tend to take more space than one would imagine a set of connecting cables should.  They are priced almost twice the lower-end cables although they are not that much better.
1594744769|5.0|I had seen this book for several months before I read it and regretted i didn't buy it sooner!  the tale is simple, a young man devoted to his eccentric grandfather who discovers upon his grandfather's grisly death the childhood life of some most unique individuals ( children and some raven like adults caretakers) from whence his grandfather came.<br />the adventure leads him to the British Isles where he becomes a bit of a hero for this odd group of children who are immortal.<br />I loved the real photos the author used to create the characters and thier magical super human abilities.<br />I am not sure a sequel would be as magical but i do look forward to more novels by this author.
0439023521|5.0|This is a book that i was completely unable to put down. I start reading it with the inanition of reading it slowly over a week or so during my spare time. That did not happen at all. Ended up reading the book in one night. Collins has herself a great book here and the second one does not disappoint either. The characters are well thought out and the plot is just absolutely brilliant. I don't want to spoil any plot so just do yourself a favor and read. I haven't started the third book yet because i literally just put down the second but I will be reading that one as well.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|Rose Gardner is a 24-year-old girl who works at a DMV, and still lives at home with her Mama.  Despite her age, Rose has lived a very sheltered life, until she sees a vision of herself dead; this vision, and other events, leads Rose to come up with twenty-eight wishes on the back of receipt that she wants to fulfill before she dies.  This story, in my opinion, was very suspenseful; I never knew where Swank was going or what she was going to reveal next, but it just made me love this book even more.  I was rooting for Rose the entire time, and for the little time the book that her mother was alive, I felt sorry for the way she was being treated; even the way her sister treated her at some points.  I was very shocked and happy at how everything played out with her and her neighbor, Joe.  Another element I loved about this book was that it was a very Southern story; and with being from the south, you learn to appreciate a good Southern novel here and there.  Overall, this was by far one of the greatest books I've ever read.

0060873027|2.0|I have enjoyed Michael Crichton's work in the past but this was simply the worst book that I have read this year. I am not sure if it was the ridiculous comic book like plot, the lack of character development or the general lack of originality that left me wishing that I had never purchased this clunker.   Crichton has done some good work in the past and it is a shame that this will be my last impression of him. If you really want to read Micro I suggest that you borrow it from a friend (more than likely they will be more than willing to part with it) but do not waste your money buying this.

159514188X|3.0|It took me a long time to read this book. I don't mean actually read it, but to get to it. I kept putting it off due to the suicide theme but last week I felt brave enough to actually tackle it and I'm glad I did. Ultimately, the book is a quick read once the reader starts wanting to know more and more about why Hannah, a seemingly popular teen, decided to kill herself. I don't want to give away any spoilers here, so I'll keep my review limited, skittering around actual events. So, here's what happens: Hannah kills herself, no one knows why, and a boy gets a box of cassettes she recorded before she died blaming 13 people for her death. If you get the box, you're one of the reasons and part of the tapes is devoted to you and why you helped end her life. As you can see, this plot device is very clever and intriguing. It also helped that the boy who currently has the box and whose thoughts the reader is eavesdropping on doesn't come up on the tapes until close to the end of the book. Asher sure knows how to keep you on tenterhooks.  And while I enjoyed the book, admired the author for his bravado in dealing with such a tricky topic, I also felt a little confused. Hannah is not very likable. In fact, her reasons for killing herself don't seem like very good reasons. Especially at the beginning. By the end of the book the reasons certainly get more profound, but something about her voice on those tapes just niggles. Is it that she's so ready to blame everyone else (when in all honesty, the profound reasons were of her own making) in such a selfish way? Or is it something deeper than that? I'm not sure. All I know is whether or not I thought the story worked I keep thinking about this book, Hannah's voice, and the essentially horribleness of high school and teenagehood (frankly). Because of that alone I give this book my recommendation.  -Sonia Pereira Murphy, author of \\"Snow Spell\\" available on Kindle.

0618918248|5.0|This was the most informative book broaching this subject I have ever come across. His choice of vocabulary at times, is extremely expansive which I was dissapointed to see given that this book should be easy to understand for the lay person. Dawkins writes with a twinge of arrogance which some very religious people may find offensive but given the nature of this book, it's bound to happen on either side as a hardcore fundamentalist or a hardcore atheist. overall amazing. Several fantastic scientific studies were used as examples to drive certain points home. this book really helped me clarify some feelings which I had about religion. I grew up as a catholic but questioned it regularly and lost all faith later in life. I began studying science in school, specifically kinesiology which helped direct me further into the doorway of natural selection/evolution and every beautiful alternative available instead of religion. great book buy it If you're seeking answers outside of your religious group for a different perspective on things based on a lot of facts.
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|I have never been much of a Charlie Chaplin fan--and I haven't seen that many of his movies, for that matter.  This movie is the work of a genius.  It is so clever and original and unique: the \\"events\\" of the \\"story,\\" his facial expressions and his physical genius, not to mention that he is credited with writing the music!  I especially love the \\"feeding machine\\" at the factory; his dance after he leaves the production line at the factory and the other dance he does when he is the entertainer at the nightclub--where did he get those \\"moves?\\"  I also love the whole sequence when he returns to work as the assistant to the man who is to fix the idled factory equipment:  his interactions with his \\"boss\\" and his time inside the cogs of the machinery (there are actually 2 different sequences inside the cogs of the machinery:  one time it is Charlie who is inside and the other time it is his boss who is inside).  Also the sequence where he is a waiter in the night club trying to serve the customer his wine and duck are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay beyond clever.  With the piece de resistance being his \\"song\\" at the nightclub.  All of this interspersed with pathos and \\"social commentary\\" on factory work and \\"the changing times\\" and people struggling to \\"make it in the world.\\"  This film is more than a gem.  I enjoy watching it over and over.

B003TJR2HS|3.0|The CableJive does work, but on an iHome Clock Radio, the connection can be tricky.  The iPhone is a little too heavy, so it leans backward and loses the connection.  It may take a few attempts to place the iPhone into the adapter and maintain connection.<br /><br />A \\"kickstand\\" or support on the adapter would provide better stability.  Overall, the product does work, but not as well as I had hoped.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|When Michael Buble came out with his first Christmas CD, I thought \\"Man, bringing back the classics, I love it!\\". So when I found out that he had a second Christmas album out I just had to get it. I was however apprehensive as I thought it may not be as good as his first. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that though he went a little more mainstream with some of the songs(Especially with his song with Shania Twain, \\"White Christmas\\"), I found a liking to it. I especially enjoyed \\"Jingle Bells\\" the song his sings with the Puppini Sisters. If it wasn't for this album, i would have never known who they are.   So Overall, though, there was only one new songs to add, though Michael's variation on most of the songs alone, on this CD, are a more than welcomed change. I only hope that next year(If he so decides to come out with another Christmas album), there be more than one new addition to make a Christmas favorite. Kudos Mr. Buble!

It is over-the-top rock and roll, but has the introspection and operatic scope that is characteristic of early Prog Rock. A simple comparison would be between Time for Everything and, say, the Ramones. Tull is dealing with existential themes with broad orchestral strokes. My only regret is that after Agualung, Jethro Tull became increasingly self-indulgent and neglected their blues / rock roots. Those interested in albums of similar influence & excellence in the same era: Fragile (Yes), Lizard (King Crimson) and Nursery Crime (Genesis).

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Borrowed my Kindle copy from my local library. File size is over 5 MB because of all the photos.  I enjoyed this read. Good storyline, but really disappointed to find it is blatently prepped for  a sequal(s) - was not aware of this before started reading. Not really designed for Kindles as the book includes many photos and letters that are not easy to discern on a small black and white screen.  Maybe better on DX or Fire.
0439023521|3.0|It's not often a story like The Hunger Games comes along.  Collins created a truly captivating world, full of things to keep the reader's imagination running right along with her somehow likable protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. However, as interesting and perhaps insightful Collins plot is, it's so hard to overcome the writing of the novel.   It's blatantly obvious from the beginning of the book that it was published by Scholastic.  It has a very junior-high feel to it.  The vocabulary is far from advanced, the sentence structure is weak at best, and the over-usage of adverbs present themselves as slightly insulting to any reader above the age of 12.  While it might be argued that Collins target audience was junior-high age kids, I think her plot is too violent, and her message too desperate, to be aimed at children.   What annoyed me the most about The Hunger Games was the empty and predictable characterization.  Prim, Katniss's sister, represents purity throughout the novel.  Prim is good, Prim is kind, Prim is young, Prim is innocent.  Well, isn't that just fantastic?  Collins basically tells us this character is good because she's good.  She tells us Gale has an inner fire without much more reasoning than he has to help provide for his family.  Katniss is supposed to be this great hero for volunteering for her sister, but I think Katniss is just over-dramatic.   Having the book from Katniss's point of view was perhaps not a great move on Collins part.  Have you ever watched a TV show where the show was titled after the main character, and no matter what trouble the main character got in, you knew he was going to be okay, because you can't have Seinfeld without Seinfeld, right?  That's basically what reading The Hunger Games was like.  It's not like Katniss could've been writing the book from her grave, so you knew you were stuck with her for the whole thing.   The dialogue was often very relaxed and believable, but when the situation got stressed, the dialogue started sounding staged.  The fast pace of The Hunger Games keeps the pages turning, but there are times when everything moves just a little too fast.  Collins warns of imminent doom without getting preachy about it, which you must give her credit for.    This story had so much potential, and it's such a shame it wasn't written as well as it could've been.  If Collins (or even another author) had given it the attention it deserved, The Hunger Games definitely could have been counted among books like Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and Brave New World.  However, all things considered, it is definitely a book worth reading, because even if it won't take you long, at least you'll know what everyone is talking about.
0156027321|5.0|If you want something really different to read...read this book. It's a very bizarre story about a ship sinking, and the lone survivor being on a lifeboat with a tiger, an orangutan, a hyena and a zebra, and a question... I would never have read this book if it hadn't been given to me by my grandson. I ended up crying at the end.
0307891402|5.0|I'm mostly posting this review about the book itself and not about all the tedious details of what's actually in the book. I have no cons for this book, anything I've ever needed to know about the game, all the way down to mundane details, is in the book. Even better, it's in the index! Sometimes, nothing beats a perfectly organized and well-thought out index, and this guide has just that. It's super easy to use.<br /><br />The book itself is big and heavy, yes, it's several inches thick and a few pounds, but with its vast amount of detail, it has to be. As long as you don't excessively abuse it (as in kicking it down concrete stairs and shooting it with a shotgun type of abuse), it will definitely last for a very long time.<br /><br />Who it's ideal for:  the Skyrim/Elder Scrolls collector, the avid Skyrim player (let's be honest though, who plays it and DOESN'T play it all the time?), a set of Skyrim players sharing one book (it comes with two ribbon page markers, which I love), the Skyrim player who loves to know what they're getting into before they do it, and the Skyrim player that wants to find all the treasures tucked away. Although honestly if you fall into the last two categories you don't need the hardback, unless you're a bibliophile, then definitely go for it, it's beautiful.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|I just received this on Saturday and promptly read the directions (which is totally uncharacteristic), assembled the contraption and practiced.  Three times.  (I had to have a large glass of wine to empty a third practice bottle) The fourth bottle was perfect and so was the fifth!  My advice is read the directions thoroughly and do what they say.  Odd, I know.  The YouTube video helped me too.  Make sure the cutter is exactly perpendicular to bottle (not slightly at an angle) and hold the bottle's score under boiling water instead of moving it through the water.  That seemed to help my later efforts.  My only complaint was I paid $33 for it last week and now it's $25 everywhere on Amazon, which is why I gave it 4 stars not 5.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Horrible film that should be avoided by all, exept maybe 10-14yr old boys. This film is actually worse than the second installation in the Transformers trilogy. I'm a fan of the first Transformers film & also the 1980's cartoon along with sci-fi films in general, but even for me & my easy-going taste in films, these two sequels are absolute pieces of rubbish.<br /><br />The Blu ray quality is fine though, crisp visuals with a strong TrueHD track, unlike the first film's release on Blu ray.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|As a kid, I recall seeing all the Stephen King books on our bookshelf at home.  They always intrigued me, especially after the movie adaptation of The Green Mile, but never enough to step away from the history/biography genre.  When I found out King had stepped into my world, I figured now was the time.    As King points out in his Afterword, a clarification of what \\"really happened\\" this book is not.  Still though, 11/22/63 is a fun walk through American history.  It was well worth the time it took to get through a book that King originally began writing in the early 1970's.
B0068AWQQ2|5.0|This movie was an unexpected gem! Acting was top shelf, along with story, and FX! I really went into this not expecting much, and got A LOT! If you enjoy a good scare without a lot of unnecessary gore but a lot of great actors, and a very entertaining story then this movie is for you! Now I hope they do more like it.
B0064BCNA4|4.0|Did you hear about the fly on the toilet seat?  He got pissed off...  I like playing the piano but I already have one so I don't need to download this. Sure it's as good as it can be on a touch-screen phone though...

1451648537|3.0|This is a very interesting book and I found much of the information in it quite revelatory. However, when I reached the end, I was quite dissatisfied, and I think this is because the author did not do justice to the 'tech' side of Jobs' life. Ultimately, a biography about Steve Jobs has to be intimately interwoven with the technological developments that occurred during his lifetime. This is what draws us to his biography: his life is very much a story of the evolution of modern computing. Unfortunately, the book leaves you with only a vague-and I would say, a little inaccurate-sense of that story.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This is a very good chess app that plays a decent game and looks great on the Kindle Fire. The interface is intuitive and it is easy to select your level of play against the computer or select to play against another person. There are a few minor things that could be improved, like listing the captured pieces and being able to \\"undo\\" your last move when checkmated, but otherwise this is a great version of chess.<br /><br />The app is free and is supported by small unobtrusive ads at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B004VMUS9G|3.0|This alarm app has as much functionality as any - one feature it has that you don't see often is decreasing the time between each snooze cycle.  However, when idling in the background, this app sucks the battery down like nobody's business on my Sprint Epic 4G.  I'd happily give the app a 5-star review if it weren't for the apparent issue idling.

0525423281|4.0|I adore Stephanie Perkins' writing. She made a stellar debut with Anna and the French Kiss and she didn't disappoint with this one.<br /><br />Lola is definitely a quirky character. Not only does she love wearing the craziest costumes everyday, but she's also snarky and innocent. Set in San Francisco and living with two fathers, her background is very unique and interesting and you'll see all of that unfold throughout the book. The romance and love story is subtle and cute, again, a book that would appeal to teens.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects was that Anna and St. Clair make appearances all throughout the book. Now, you should know that you didn't have to read Anna and the French Kiss before reading this book, there is nothing that relates to them significantly here to make you feel like you're missing anything. It's just fun for those who have read that book to see these characters again and catch up with their lives a bit. And if you haven't read that book, it might even get you interested in checking it out.<br /><br />One thing I couldn't stand, was the name Cricket. Don't get me wrong, I really liked Cricket, sweet and funny guy, clear spark between him and Lola, but I hate his name. It's mentioned so many times throughout the book, obviously, it kind of annoyed me and I was like \\"Why, Stephanie, why?!\\". Yes, it's different and memorable, but I'm not a fan.<br /><br />Anyways, as far as the story goes, I really enjoyed it. Stephanie's writing is fun, cute, and appealing. I liked this a bit more than Anna and the French Kiss though, simply because Lola and Cricket's love seemed to flow better and Lola's struggles to discover and be proud of herself and realizing her feelings for Cricket was entertaining and genuine.<br /><br />Honestly, if you love a cute love story and don't mind his name so much, then you'll definitely want to check this one out.
B005TTEFRG|1.0|All the parts are there, but... but... this movie sucks. Really sucks. No depth, no decent dialogue, no continuity, no epci feel, blood for bloods sake, and no heart. Save you money, buy hammer and break your own fingers. That'll be less painful.
1878424602|5.0|This particular book is an excellent beginning to your spiritual journey. It is a small book, and a very quick read. But, for those who are trying to open their eyes for the first time, this book will be a great launching pad. The chapters will mean something different every time that you come back to them. You will find peace, and answers with Deepak Chopra!
B00005YUNY|2.0|What in the world are you people listening to?<br /><br />113 five star reviews? I purchased this DVD 2 weeks ago based on all of these great 5 and 4 star reviews. And have now given 3 listens, beginning to end, thinking maybe I'm missing something. If not for the nice video quality, this would be a 1 star review.<br /><br />What bothers me the most about this concert is the fact that they squandered a (probably) once in a lifetime opportunity to take advantage of having a full symphony orchestra at their disposal for a live performance. But the orchestra looks and sounds like a bunch of under rehearsed high school kids. They aren't really given much to play to begin with, they're consistently out of tune, and what they do play is very basic string and horn accompaniment, which is buried so far into the mix, they might as well not be there at all (probably mixed that way because they WERE so badly out of tune). If you really want to hear what a rock band with a great symphony arrangement has the potential to sound like, check out Sting's Live In Berlin, Peter Gabriel's New Blood, or even Kansas' There's Know Place Like Home. Hell, try Transiberian Orchestra - they been at the live Rock/Symphony thing for years. Some of the stuff they do will melt the hair off the back of your neck.<br /><br />Jon Anderson's voice is spot on - he sounds strong and clear, and hits almost every single note effortlessly. My complaint - and I saw one reviewer actually COMPLIMENT this fact - is that his vocals are absolutely \\"dry\\" (a recording term meaning there are no \\"effects\\" on his voice - no reverb, no delay, no nothing - dry). Jon Anderson's singing without the vocal effects is like having cake without the icing. His voice just lends itself PERFECTLY to nice deep reverberation and a slight trailing delay. I think he is done a disservice in this respect. Anyway - moot point now: I'm very glad to see/hear his solo efforts going so well.<br /><br />Alan White sounds great as always. And he and Squire are really trying their best to create a strong rhythm. But Squire is overplaying everything. He's probably trying to overcompensate for the lack of excitement at the opposite end of the stage. Which leads me to -<br /><br />Steve Howe - should just pack it up and go home. He's really been starting to tick me off for the last 10 years or so. His playing anymore is stale, dry, completely soulless and uninspired. His guitar sounds/tone are completely lame - thin, tinny and dry. Even his hollow body - how does one manage to take a big hollow body guitar and make it sound like a tin cup with a metal string attached?  He looks bored throughout....as if he really doesn't want to be there at all. Maybe he is bored. But dam it, when people are paying their hard earned money to see a show, you put on a show. Whether you're hating it or not. As a guitar player myself, Steve was a god to me when I was a kid just starting out. From the very first note he struck on Yours Is No Disgrace, I was hooked on his playing, and much of my own style developed based on his technique on those early Yes albums. But to be honest, I don't think he's had a decent guitar riff since GFTO. Tormato was the beginning of his downfall, and now his riffs are just aimless squabling all over the place. Top that off with the horrible tone of his guitars/amps and I really don't think he has anything left to offer.<br /><br />The keyboard player is ok (Tom Brislin), although a little bit spastic - I'm guessing he was attempting to drum up some sort of excitement out of this boring mess. Although, I do really like his band \\"Spiraling\\". Check them out if you want to hear a \\"newer\\" band with some Yes/Gentle Giant type of influence.<br /><br />Yes, the overall sound and picture on this DVD is crystal clear....but to what end? You hear the crystal clarity of a mostly uninspired band just going through the motions, and an out of tune novice orchestra. This borders on torture.d he and Squire are really trying their best to create a strong rhythm. But Squire is overplaying everything.

B0064BCNA4|3.0|This app is very basic - a single octave keyboard (C-B, not even a full C-C octave).  The \\"follow me\\" feature might be slightly amusing to young kids for a short time, but is otherwise not so useful.  The app doesn't scale well for a tablet - the keys are VERY large on a tablet.  I got this as the free app of the day.  I would have been very disappointed if I had paid any amount for it at all, as there are much better piano apps out there for free.
B0064BCNA4|5.0|Says what it does. Downloads &amp; works perfectly on HTC Incredible running 2.3.4. Funny little app. I will use it mostly for entertaining my 2 year old. Not bad. What you would &amp; should expect from reading the description.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game has the simple elegance that marks the classic puzzles. The graphics are pleasing and the music peaceful, but this game would also play well in stripped down old school style.
0439023513|1.0|Couldn't even finish this book it is so bad. Here is a clue, we don't need 100 pages where Katniss has her internal monolgue (which is almost entirely self centered). Also if you make such a big deal out of this \\"Mockingjay\\" costume, divert some boring pages to actually describe it, not sure what it is supposed to be. sorry ending, when the first book showed promise and the second was repsectable.
B0037XPP84|5.0|I confess I was not very enthusiastic about this movie, I was told it was not as good as the first. However I had to change my mind after few minutes, for this movie is really great! How rich England´s history is!!!  Video quality is crispy as desired for a Blu-ray, this production deserves five stars or even more a real masterpiece to be watched several times.

B0064BCNA4|3.0|This app is kinda neat, but it doesn't hold my attention for more than a few minutes.

B004LWZW4M|3.0|It takes 75+ minutes for the apes to rise. The story is good, yet it could have been a 45 minute television movie.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I have given this watch one full year of training and events before writing a review. I was frustrated with it within a month, but didn't think that winter training was a fair assessment.  Now that I have dealt with this \\"training aid\\" for a year I think that I can write a decent review. As a broad stroke overview; this is the first Garmin I have ever bought and could be the last.   The Pros of this watch: built in GPS is dead on with accuracy and it takes very little time to locate your position. It is also easy use and to get started with.    The Cons: the charge will only last for about 4 hours and not the 8 that is advertised. I participate in Iron distance events and marathons and the watch is decent for training days, but it can not be worn on race days.    The bezel feature looks like a good idea on paper, but once the sweat begins the functionality of the bezel is all but lost.   It loses too much charge looking for my HR monitor and the GPS at a race event when 90% of the field has HR monitors and/or a GPS device. I had a fully charged watch last weekend at a marathon.  Just before the 1 mile mark, I had a \\"low battery.\\" This was 7 minutes into a 3 and 1/2 hour day.  It beeped at me until I tossed it to a friend at mile 15.  Once the watch begins beeping at you with \\"low battery\\" there is no way to stop the watch.    With all the features it has, it needs a swimming option and a lifting option. Currently, you only have the option to run or bike.    I will be looking at Suunto, Timex, Polar and different Garmin models in the future.
1451627289|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that, although I am an avid reader, this was my first Stephen King novel. The thing that most turned me on to this book was the title and (surprise!) the story line. As a person who has always been interested in the conspiracy theories and details surrounding the assassination of JFK, I was hooked on this book before I even started. Overall, this novel was not what I expected it to be, but it was a great pull-you-in escape from the world for a couple of days.   As I was reading this book, I periodically went to the internet to check on historical facts, just out of curiosity. I was very impressed with the way the author tied in all sorts of true facts about this period in history. I really love that in a book; I think it gives the story more depth. Also, although I was not alive for the early 1960's, I feel like the details given about the mindset of Americans, political environment, and physical surroundings during that time rang true. It was all incredibly believable, and I really felt as though I was swept up into the lives of the characters.   The one thing that I didn't love about this book - and this could just be King's writing style, but like I mentioned, this was my first of his books - was that I felt like there were a lot of \\"side stories\\" happening. In my opinion, it seemed that there was a lot of unnecessary story lines taking place apart from the plot against JFK, which was what originally drew me in to the book. I found myself wanting to skip over some of the random events in order to get to the more historical, true-to-life parts.   I enjoyed reading this book, and I would recommend it. I am also thinking about finding another of King's books to read. Any suggestions? :)
B0064BCNA4|3.0|I am not one to complain about a FAOTD but if I had to pay for this I would have been very disappointed. It is minimal in features at best. It has maybe 12 songs (5 or so are Polish) you can follow along with but no way to listen to the song to see how it should sound. Makes it kinda pointless to try to learn a new song.  multi touch for chords is not effective on the droid x. The different instruments is the only perk to this app. Definitely not worth paying for without at least several more features.  For parents concerned about child lock search for zoodles/ kid mode. Awesome app for kids (and FREE) and one I recommend to anyone with kids and a smart phone. They also have a PC version!
B0064BCNA4|2.0|The app doesn't support multi-touch very well. I'm using an Asus Transformer tablet. Keys turn yellow when you press then, but when you press 2 at a time one stays yellow after release. The sound isn't very good either.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this over the Citizen because it didn't have leather in the band that would start to smell after he got it wet washing his hands. It's a fantastic everyday watch. He even sleeps in it. Seems like it will last him a while, and he couldn't be more pleased with it. I wanted him to have something in between his two dress watches and his huge Suunto that he wears to the field, and subsequently daily over his rose gold Skaagen. With this little prize he's still an Army man but with some class/pizazz that we both are super happy with!  As long as the band and watch hold up well, I'm super pleased with it and the 3 day shipping.
0307588343|5.0|Being a former member of the investment community I found this book to have hit the nail square on the head. It was, after all, the unchecked greed and arrogance of those named, i.e., Dick Fuld and his cronies that brought down Lehman, and nearly everyone else. Of course major blame also goes to the sellers of mortgages, who the author calls \\"body builders\\", to those who couldn't possibly make regular payments especially after the teaser rates reset to higher rates. The author also blames the two rating agencies, Moodys and Standard & Poors who received generous fees for rating worthless paper as AAA thereby making it possible for banks, insurance companies, and pension funds to buy that paper. The few heros, such as Mike Gelband, were voices shouting in the wilderness warning the top management to reduce their exposure to the various mortgage backed securities. The top people weren't listening; indeed they were busy expanding their exposure to what later was proved to be worthless.  The book was exciting to read and would make a great movie. The story shows what happens when unbridled greed and ego meet. The result was disaster. We're still paying for this failure of common sense.

0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games is a book that's easy to get engrossed in.  It's one of those books that will probably have you hooked by the end of the second page.  It's a very fast paced book where the plot seems to move at the speed of a movie.  In fact, as I read through it, I could easily visualize it scene by scene as a movie. So, don't start reading this at bedtime unless you plan to stay up all night reading!  The premise of this book is horrific--the main focus is on kids battling each other to the death in a futuristic gladiator-type arena.  So, that gave me a second reason to not read this book at bedtime--it was unsettling enough to give me nightmares.  However, this book is a great read.  It's right up there with Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game as a tale of a youth who has fate of the world riding on their shoulders.
B0000DK4RM|1.0|This DVD would not work in either dvd player, the ps3, the Xbox, or my laptop. What a POS, I'm guessing the seller copied in a foriegn country, because my lap top told me I had to switch regions, but didn't say which to switch it to.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|Spielberg and J.J. Abrams got together to do homage to the former's earlier adventure time and alien movies and filming old school style and then used a bunch of CGI effects to do it. Did they want to say, see CGI can be used to create the same experience?<br />J.J. Abrams Loves flare. (Flare are the flashes of light across the screen that occur from reflection on the lens. It is gay especially when excessively present, which it is).<br />This movie is loaded out the hole with metaphors for coming of age psychological-social drama. In small town USA. The train carrying the monster alien crashes into the kids as love/lust blossoms. The girl and boy and their two daddies' conflict and the mother's death.. Girl tells boy not to give up his train for the domineering fat boy. The oppressed alien is released from it's subterranean dwelling, builds it's rocket ship on the town's tallest structure and launches off -after the boy tells the alien it can live and be free. The town is destroyed in the process and the ultimate symbol of society's repressive, overwhelming force (the military) is overcome. And if you aren't paying attention you still get the scene when the boy symbolically lets go of the chain his mother gave him and it becomes part of the alien's ship.<br />Maybe it worked better on paper.

1451627289|5.0|With Stephen King, you never know.  Misery was so profoundly scary I couldn't read it when I was home alone.  Other works by SK  were just silly.  11/22/63 is one of SK's best works, full of philosophical dilemmas, beautifully drawn characters, and a perfect ending.
B003EYVXV4|4.0|Very smart doctor niece and smart grand niece recommended these series of The Hunger Games as a must read. I was not disappointed. Can't wait for the movie to come out so I can watch it. I love reading first and watching second. Bring it on!
0756405890|5.0|I absolutely love The Name of the Wind. The story within a story plot helped make this story unique. The characters, the plot, basically everything about this book captivated me from the very beginning. I have read it several times and never get tired of it. The characters seem real. They have flaws and act the way a normal person would given their situations. With Kote telling the story of his past you are introduced to two extremely different characters. So you can't help but wonder throughout the entire book \\"what happened?\\" to make him change so drastically.   It is an absolutely fantastic read. While I did not like the sequel, I am holding out for the hope that the third book may redeem past mistakes because this book is simply amazing.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|When it works, it works great!<br />It picks and chooses some days that it won't connect even with 4G service. If that gets fixed, 5 stars :)
0756404738|2.0|I am extremely sad and disappointed that I am writing this kind of review. Let me first say that I wanted to love this book desperately. I sang countless praises for The Name of the Wind, and waited on baited breathe for Wise Man's Fear. I read The Name of the Wind five times before WMF came out. Sadly it was all for naught and for one large reason. I could look past the many little faults that ran throughout the book, but the female characters were the final stroke. I am insulted by the women in the book. These seemingly cultured and intelligent women suddenly had mouths that were as filthier than a sewer and most of the women seemed far too eager to spread their legs for Kvothe. The kid is 16!!! The part with Felurian was ridiculous at best, which was even more disappointing because she had so much potential at being the amazing character she was hinted at in the first book. If the third book has women that are anything like the second book I will simply throw the series in the trash. It wouldn't be worth reselling by that point.
B00650SSWG|4.0|Much better than your average chick flick. Justin and Mila are absolutely adorable.  The movie opens with Mila waiting for her boyfriend at the theater to see Pretty Women, fairy tale of the 90s. The story line here makes for a great fairy tale of today. But perhaps the best thing about the movie is the sound track. I'm pretty sure they stole the play list off my DROID2.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Harry Potter. Need I say more? Haha, I heard that the HP movies were going to be placed into a 'vault' (that's what my friends and I call it, kind of like the Disney vault) I knew I had to get the movies. So I waited for HP Deathly Hallows Part 2 to be released on DVD to see what kind of packages they had. I liked this one and it was cheaper than Target!
B004Y1USJE|3.0|Lets face it, if you have been listening to Yes all your life, you know what you want and you arent ever going to get it again. (PLEASE keep reading).  That said, life goes on.   If you REALLY want what you are looking for ( and if you do... you already know this) but you should be listening to IF and Cor Cordium by Glass Hammer.  Babb and Schendel have secured the talents of Jon Davison whose vocals are eerily close to Jon Anderson.   I haved loved Glass Hammer from the beginning. And they have certainly gone through personnel changes like Yes, but amazingly they seem to get better with each output. However, these last two albums are what Yes should be in this decade. If you arent familiar with GH please do yourself a favor and check them out.  Would love to see Yes drop the Buggles and employ Davison. His vocals would make two formidable bands even better.  Hope this is of help.
0545128285|5.0|I had heard this book was good, but never had the chance to buy it. While I was buying the HP books, I decided to buy this one too, because I feel like it is apart of the collection even if it really isn't.
0316056863|3.0|I liked this book. I just didn't love it. I was interested in hearing Tina Fey's story. I am not a tv watcher, but I was aware that she was involved in SNL, did Sarah Palin impersonations and had a tv show (which I've never seen).  But the book didn't make me laugh much (just once on page 157). It has nothing to do with her being female: back when I used to watch tv I'd be laughing until my stomach hurt watching I Love Lucy, Laverne & Shirley, and Roseanne. I just didn't think the book was very funny.  I did however, find it interesting, and it was a quick read.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app! I can listen to what's playing all over the world! Easy to use, great app. Very rarely loses stream time. Using Motorola Atrix 2 4G.
B005XN3150|5.0|I have loved fairy tales for as long as I can remember...I always wondered what happened after they kissed. And now, I have an idea! The only word for this show is amazing. I will have to say though, that sometimes the stories get kinda of lost in all the character drama. And yet, I still love it! I can't wait to see more!
1451648537|5.0|I bought this book because I was wondering how a 'pain in the ass' kind of guy could rise to a level of stardom unsurpassed by any CEO ever before. Isaacson did a great job in my view and wrote a well balanced biography including the good, the bad and the ugly sides of Jobs.<br /><br />What I got out of this book, and from Jobs's life is that passion and focus is the recipe for success. Find your passion, focus your energy and success will follow.<br /><br />Job's view on creating the best customer experience possible by producing state of the art products in their simplest form is what made Apple big. Creating great products that feel great, look great, always work fine and even my 8 year old son can operate with ease must have been a daunting task, but he and his team did it.......time and again.<br /><br />Maybe his greatest accomplishment was to have the best and brightest of the industry onboard the Apple vessel and have them perform miracles on a daily basis. They work as a team across the entire company. It pretty much mimics the products itself: hardware and software jointly working together to create the best output.<br /><br />I have no worries about Apple's future as long as they continue to embrace innovation and keep focussing on quality and customer experience.<br /><br />Job wasn't very much interested in market research because he wanted to create products that didn't exist yet and people didn't know they wanted. Or as Henry Ford said: \\"If I asked people what they wanted they would have answered: a faster horse.\\"<br /><br />I truly enjoyed reading this book. Not only because of the subject but also because of the way Isaacson wrote it. I run off now to catch a copy of his other biographies (Einstein, Franklin, Kissinger). Can't wait....
B003Y5H5FQ|3.0|To be truthful this movie isn't half the movie of the original. The whole point of the movie was that the nerd battled the vampire to win the girl. In this one he's the cool guy with a fine babe. which in the first he had a babe but he was awkward with her and not surrounded by cool kids.  ALso the original was a salute to b movie stars , this one now has the vamp hunter as magician. The effects also relied only on not so good cgi. This was a mistake that too many films are making. Cgi can be used but real makeup helps alot. And it has a stupid ending beyond belief. It's a A movie and I have rated movies that had no money  and were hokey higher than this one. The three d looks great but the original films intent is gone. Too many remakes are out there and they are not living up to the original.  The acting is fine here but seriously? what mental midget decided to have people who are dead come back to life after killing the head vampire?  Too much cgi without any real makeup looks pretty bad often and yet this is what we get.  I love david tennant though , in spite of this bad revamping of the original he is still great in it. And the head vampire is good too, in fact all of the acting is well done. So it's not their fault at all.
1439102732|4.0|She is a better writer than this, but I'm so glad she brought up the issue and portrayed the normalcy of LGBT life.  I read some reviews not liking the way the \\"holy rollers\\" were portrayed, but I thought she was mostly fair.  Sometimes, though, I have to admit those people seem like that to me, just mean and evil \\"in the name of God\\" just to be mean and evil.  It's so hard to be hated so vehemently, and so hard not to see those people as villains.
076780421X|5.0|This movie is still refreshing to the soul even in today's world. 14 years old and it delivers more than the modern day romance we see. It's romance without the cheesiness but yet manages to capture the heart. Michael Perry and Salma Hayek delivered impeccably. Stand out performances.   Simply put , this is one movie that you should have in your collection. Timeless romantic story!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This product is great!  The grandkids can knock it around & drool all over it and it still looks good.  I got the pink which is easy to find and is very attractive. The elastic band holds it securely closed (the 18 month old hasn't taken the time yet to figure out how to open it.) The cover folds into a stand for convenience.
B005KJZDXK|1.0|This is the first review I've ever written, but this album was so horrible that I felt it was my duty to humanity to make sure that this CD didn't go on to spoil countless Christmas' around the world!  Christmas music should make you feel happpy - especially with Zooey's voice.  But what they decided to do with this album is, well, bad.  There's no other way to put it.  If you don't believe me, just listen to a sampling of their take of Baby, It's Cold Outside.  What on Earth made them think it was a good idea to switch roles?  Forget that the song makes no sense this way, it also sounds terrible because they put Zooey's voice in the background.  Do yourself a favor and buy the Buble CD.
B004GIV0QK|3.0|I expected a bit more from this movie based on its reviews.  Obviously, each review is subjective, but I can't see much over three stars here.  Bridges is good, yes, and there is some chemistry between him and Allen, but the plot is held together by band aids.  Obviously, for a movie like this one must be able to suspend belief to enjoy, but this one asks a little too much.  People help the protagonists out for no obvious reason, and there simply isn't enough connection made between the two main characters throughout to make the deep affection they feel for each other at the end believable.
1451627289|2.0|Stephen King is an on-off favourite of mine,ie. not all his books are good, but I have loved some.<br /><br />The premise of his latest novel was so fascinating, that I had to buy it! Even the \\"newspaper-like\\" book cover with the announcement of JFK's murder on the front and a photoshopped version of a different reality on the back cover was enticing.<br />What would have happened to the US if JFK had not been assasinated by Oswald?<br /><br />I tried to read the book for ten days, and then I gave up. The size of the novel---800+ pages is quite intimidating, but this would not have been a problem if I had been sucked into the tale.<br />It was slow and ponderous. I could not get into it. I do not recommend it. I am an avid reader, but I have very little patience if I am not drawn in fairly quickly. At my age, I don't have the time!<br />Now I am curious to read the favourable reviews now and find out what I missed!
B0064BCNA4|2.0|didn't seem different from the free version, and cant really play multiple keys at the same time or hold notes.  Basically will entertain small kids for a short time.
0385534639|2.0|So like a lot of other reviewers I feel conflicted about this book. I really, really wanted to like it. The idea sounded interesting, and I am a huge fan of fantasy type books. And While Erin Morgenstern really is good at describing the world she is writing about, this story was really boring to me. It was just too slow, I kept expecting the story to finally start but it never really did. Maybe it's the way she tells the story but I found myself having a hard time getting into the book and relating to the characters. It also took me quite a while to read this book, and I found myself not looking forward to it the way I usually am with books. In all, I gave it 2 stars for the interesting idea, the beautiful book artwork, and her ability to describe such a beautifully artistic world, but I left the other 3 stars out because of the boring story pace and equally boring characters.
B00006GA4C|4.0|There was a point at which 'Blues' met up with 'Rock & Roll'; Grand Funk took it for a spin and 'Electrified' it, and at times spiced it with funk. This is a 'Detroit Rock' tradition.<br /><br />'Winter And My Soul' and 'Nothing Is The Same' being a very good example of this; 'Mr. Limousine Driver', 'In Need' and 'Paranoid' are also notable songs for this album.<br />These songs have earned four stars in my iPod. The 24-bit Remastering, reissue here is as good as it gets for this vintage.
B0064BCNA4|1.0|Laggy touch response, limited keys and a chincy set of options make this a lame keyboard choice.  There are lots of other free keyboards out there that are more versatile than this.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My daughter is really into princesses and this is exactly what it says and she LOVES it!  It is easy to apply and reapply, but you must have smooth walls!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I had thought the Planet of the Apes series had run its course creatively, but this one is definitely worth watching.
B005J9ZE5I|3.0|I've long wanted to get this movie and now that I have it I must say I remember it being better than it actually was. Oh it's still fun but it's not as scary as I remembered it. But Evil Dead 2 is the comic twin of Evil Dead, the darker scarier of the two. Still the movie was a bargain and I will watch it again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really like this app. I have had no problems with. Very fun. I wish Free Scrabble was as good. The advertisements are not a problem.
0800141806|1.0|gave it 20 minutes but it didn't get anywhere - the music kept saying something big is coming but the same mundane tone continued on and on and on. No thanks.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Simply put, this is a good memory card with a lot of storage.  I was able to fit about 16 games on it and could maybe fit more.  I wouldn't recommend paying more for a larger one unless you have a whole bunch of games.  And just so you know, you can only save PS2 games on it, not PS1.
B00006JSS8|5.0|One of my favorite singers is Stevie Wonder.  I wanted to get my CD collection of Stevie started, so I started with this CD.  It has great songs on it.  This is a great CD to buy if you are a Stevie Wonder fan.
B001U887P6|4.0|I purchased a size 9 pair of crocs for my daughter, who wears shoe size 8. I figured the shoes will be just right, being a size bigger. Nope. Turns out they are running much smaller (and tight, probably because of the lining). So, my daughter won't be wearing them, but her grandma will (her shoe size is 7). Keep in mind the difference in sizes when purchasing. Other than that, these crocs were perfect.
B005LJITS0|1.0|I would give it zero stars if I could.  I like action movies, superhero movies, and almost every actor involved with this film.  But this movie was worse than Spawn.  Boring, ridiculous and tedious all at the same time.  Sad that so many talented people wasted their time making this film.  I would not recommend you waste any time watching it.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|As soon as I bought my Kindle Fire, I noticed that I would like to be able to prop it up in order to read it/and or watch it. I ordered this MicroShell Folio Cover from Amazon.com because the pics showed that I could do it. My biggest complaint about this is that I would prefer to be able to prop it up the \\"protrait\\" or tall way and this only allows me to prop it up in \\"landscape\\" direction. I like it's light weight--the Kindle Fire surely isn't light!! It is downright heavy!
0553573403|1.0|NOTE: NO spoilers here.<br /><br />I quit at page 134, so I can't spoil much, anyway.<br /><br />So what I'd like to do is save you from the first 134 pages, if it's not your kind of book.<br /><br />This book is a soap opera set in the quasi-Middle Ages. If lots of court intrigue and cruel aristocrats is your thing, you might love this. If you are a lover of Tolkien, Erikson, Donaldson, Moorcock and Brooks--and I'll even add the great SF writer, Frank Herbert, due to his epic scale, historical influence and court intrigue--you still might, but I think you are less likely to. Unfortunately, the Prologue (and the recommendation of a friend) got me to read this--well, to *buy* this--and I've been trying to like it, but I keep reading a chapter or two between other books and I just can't get into it. It's so boring I am simply amazed by the rave reviews.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read the first few chapters somewhere before you buy it.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|I live the game but it keeps crashing on my Rezound. please update so I can enjoy the game without having to reboot my phone.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Pretty decent clear case for iPhone 4/4s. The fit is excellent and the material is medium flexible. It is not made of silocon so it is harder and the fit is tight, but not so tight as a hard case. I like the feel of the case since it is much less tacky than silicon and won't stuck in your pocket entangled with your keys and other stuff. It is not bulky as some other cases and still   fit most custom chargers designed for iPhone.  Overall it is an excellent product. You won't regret your purchase decision.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|What is up with the naked women picture in the hall? I love Jane Eyre and was looking forward to this movie. Earlier version had some things morally i did not want in my movie collection so i was really excited about this adaption. Well I have males in my home naked  woman picture in the hall keeps me from owning this movie...:(
1456407872|5.0|\\"I HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.\\"<br />~Charles Dickens, 1843.<br /><br />And so A CHRISTMAS CAROL has since its publication; it has never been out of print or truly out of fashion. It is the quintessential Christmas story and the easiest of Dickens books to read. The narrator introduces us to Mr. Scrooge, a man whose heart has turned to stone from ambition, care, avarice, and greed. We see him at his desk in Scrooge and Marley Money House dark and chilled since he is too tight fisted to permit decent coal fires and candles. He scorns everyone that visits his office Christmas Eve, especially his nephew, Fred. But when he finally gets home, the massive door knocker transforms into Marley's face and strangely lights the foggy dark night.<br /><br />But Marley specter follows Scrooge to his bed chamber with chains, locks, and money boxes wrapped about his transparent body. He means to save his friend the fate that he has endured since he died seven years ago on this very night. Three Ghosts will haunt Scrooge: The Ghost of Christmas Past, The Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come - whom looks much like Death. Through the lessons these specters will reveal, Scrooge has a chance to become a different man and employer and lead a different life.<br /><br />Scrooge's transformation is genuine as it is remarkable. Through Dickens's simple narration, we not only witness Scrooge change but we also feel his emotions. We cry at the possible demise of Tiny Tim and the true affection Fred has for his uncle. Scrooge on Christmas morning has rediscovered faith, hope, and charity and his heart is full of love for the season as well as his neighbors. This novella is one I read every Christmas and I love it more each year.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I listen every day to this cd, it has not once skipped! It's my favorite cd and I love her so much, my kids sing along in the car, we love Adele, thanks for the great deal! It shipped fast and has not left my cd player in my car since!

B00002EPJH|5.0|This album is breathtaking!  Of course, I am a very huge fan of Keith Jarrett and this CD exceeds my expectations.  The cuts are all so beautifully played.  I am not a big fan of song , \\"Be My Love\\" BUT Mr. Jarrett plays it that I absolutely love it!  It completely cancels out Mario Lanza's version of this sappy song as far as I am concerned.  He takes every song and makes it his own.  I love love love, did I say love? this album if you are a Keith Jarrett fan you will love it too.
B005H0IW6W|1.0|Hows everyone doing on this cloudy December afternoon? I love America to the fullest but lately I've been noticing a lot of offensive remarks by people lately since it is December and I've been going out to the mall lately. Well anywho... I was at the mall the other day and some old fat guy dressed in a Santa Clause outfit told me \\"Merry Christmas\\"... I was SO OFFENDED! I almost cried. I immediately called mall security to have the Santa man arrested and called my lawyer. I think it is unconstitutional and very offensive for someone to say \\"Merry Christmas\\"... it hurts my feelings and I will NOT tolerate it!  This CD is a very offensive ... nothing but Christmas songs?!! I am calling my Congressman and telling them I am offended by this.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The cold war, the Cuban Missile Crisis, gasoline at 30 cents a gallon: these were realities of life if you were born in the early 1950s.  I was 13 when JFK was shot.  I remember like yesterday the teacher coming to my science class room and talking to our teacher at the door.  Then our teacher announced to us that \\"President Kennedy has died.  He was shot today in Dallas, Texas.\\"  Our teacher was Canadian and he went right on with the lesson.  My most vivid memory of the days that followed is Kennedy's son John-John raising his hand in salute as the coffin passes him.  My mom and sister both burst into tears. (Yes, for you younger folks, that was the John Kennedy that was killed in a plane crash in 1999.)<br /><br />King brought all these memories to life for me in 11/22/63, the story of a man from 2011 that goes back to 1958 to try to stop the Kennedy assasination in 1963.  I am a King fan and this will not take the place of my number one novel, The Stand, but it comes close.  Sometimes I couldn't put it down and sometimes I couldn't go on reading because of all the memories.<br /><br />Everything is in this story: romance, suspense, history, science fiction, not to mention what makes King excel over other popular writers of the day.  That, in my opinion, is his ability to weave themes into a story that re-occur and tie the story together emotionally.  One example from this book, \\"the past harmonizes.\\"  There is nothing of the supernatural here yet the function of the supernatural is replaced by the weird and intriguing idea that the past does not want to change.<br /><br />Another example is the dancing theme. Dancing occurs at several points in the story and forms the thread for Sadie's words in the end, \\"How we danced.\\" Even as I write this, those words cause my chest to grip.<br /><br />Some say that King's biggest strength is his story telling.  I disagree.  King is a great story teller.  Yet, his biggest strength is his ability to make us care about the characters.  Even Marina Oswald, whose name is all but lost in history, comes alive to us as she struggles with being an outsider trapped in a marriage to an abusive lunatic.<br /><br />Ultimately this story is a romance.  Didn't someone once say that \\"it is always about the girl?\\"  Jake and Sadie had me smiling and tearing up and thinking about the romances in my life, good and not so good (is romance ever really bad?).  I am not a fast reader or a \\"long session reader\\".  An hour at a time is my usual.  But the last 200 pages or so kept me reading for most of one evening and I then stopped with 20 pages to go because I wasn't ready to say goodbye to Jake and Sadie. I woke up at 4:00 AM the next morning and read the last 20 pages as well as the end material.  Then my eyes water up. Sorry, I am a 61 year old guy and, unlike Jake, I do cry.<br /><br />So, thanks again, Stephen for your dedication to your readers, your hard research and your imagination.  I was swept away by this story.cters.

B005HSL626|4.0|it is a very fun and addicting app. problay one of the best free apps (next to angry birds) but after a while my kindle fire wouldn't open it. thats the only thing that's keeping it from 5 stars(and the annoying adds)
1401323952|5.0|Nigella has produced many recipe books, but this one is much more personal in its presentation. She has put herself into the book and it feels as if she is standing beside you as you are reading and preparing the recipes in your kitchen. Highly recommended.
B000AXSN5G|2.0|The recording is so bass heavy that it is not pleasurable to listen to. The music on this CD is also on the live \\"Heart of Gold\\" DVD movie...the sound quality is quite good on the live recording. Mr. Young's performance of the songs is also better on the live recording.
B005N95JA4|5.0|I bought the original album (33 1/3) back in 1978 and loved it. I went to their '78 tour in support of it and as always was blown away. Now that the deluxe album has come out I don't see why they didn't release both or as a double album.  It is fantastic. I just goes to show you the different sounds and types of music the Stones are capable of. I would recommend this album to die hard Stones fans and novices alike
B00000ING2|5.0|It has a ripoff of Brazil near the beginning (at least, I see it that way and wouldn't mark it against the Coens if it were actually a rip off) and everyone acts with such peculiar affectations, but it's just such a great, warm movie. That opening narration over the music from Spartacus (which I have to believe was written specifically in time with that music, to match its tone and crescendos) just gives me chills and puts a smile on my face (and, I'll admit, at times, tears in my eyes). It's just perfect.<br /><br />It's an homage to films from the 30s and 40s, it's melodramatic, hilarious, and just makes me feel good. The deus ex machina near the end is so over the top and cynical, that it almost circles all the way back around to sincerely heart-warming. So, sure, the film's cynicism might imbue the whole affair with a hint of darkness, but for a Coen bros. film, it's quite up beat. Of course it's quirky, but it puts me in a better mood.<br /><br />EDIT: After the HD version disappeared from another streaming service, I bought the instant video from amazon. The quality is *terrible.* It's really low resolution and looks noticeably worse than a 480p clip of the opening on Youtube. On top of that, it stops to buffer incessantly and then asks to lower the quality even further. However, I had JUST been watching Season 4 of Park's and Recreation in high def with 5.1 sound. For some reason, when I watch standard def, stereo content on instant it buffers and buffers and then lowers the quality, while HD streams fine. You're better off getting this on a used DVD since it is, apparently, never coming out on BD (I hope I'm wrong about this). I hope the instant video feature here continues to improve.
1582701709|1.0|Like so many self-help books that equate contentment with dollar signs and worldly success, this book's team of failures turned experts have no experience to boast outside of their having embraced a certain secret - one that is curiously never articulated.  The secret of course is that their success comes entirely from talking about having a secret to success.  It recalls the videos and seminars from the 80's and 90's where tremendously rich manic-depressive types would toss around photos of their boat, but their only source of income is bragging about their success.  It's a really insane racket of delusions of success that attempts to sell total absense of effort or innovation as a means of quick success.<br /><br />What's especially absurd about \\"The Secret\\" is their open admission that there were many great masters before them who also knew the secret.  They list tons of historical greats, leaving out the hordes of new-agers touting ego fetishism that lived between them and other spiritist lunatics like Lincoln or legitimately trustworthy and admirable Masons like the US's founding fathers.<br /><br />The secret to the secret is twofold:<br />1. Tell people you have a secret and only talk around it, because if you told them your actual secret (convincing people you're not a con-artist while conning them) then you'd be arrested in most states and civilized nations.<br />2. A ton of crafty people understand exactly what makes some people great (willpower and concentration) but mistake these virtues' origin as being contrived and presume the goal of the feigned creativity is nothing more than material vindication.<br /><br />Essentially this book is trash, designed by trailer-park troglodytes and only for trailer-park troglodytes, a furtherance of the American dream of pulling money out of thin air.  If what distinguishes books from the paper they're printed on is the writing that imbues a human quality, this volume proves that money really does grow on trees.  I'm glad to see the thousands of apes jabbing at typewriters have come out with a grammatically correct product over the past century, I just wish it had some greater effect than furthering recreational deforestation.ing at typewriters have come out with a grammatically correct product over the past century, I just wish it had some greater effect than furthering recreational deforestation.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I bought this book because it was the Kindle Daily Deal, not knowing what to expect.  I enjoyed how the author wove 3 different stories together.  This book was such a mix of quirky humor and the horrible abuse that the main character experienced in the orphanage.  Reading the afterword, bothered me because these orphanages really existed.  Made me want to adopt a school age child!  I loved the dialect of the crustier characters. I could picture this book as a movie because of its vivid descriptions and rich characters.  Although fiction, this book has a lot of raw emotion which makes it hard to stop reading.  The end had me nervous.
B0064BCNA4|3.0|this is the same exact app as the free one (I know this is the free app of the day for Monday Dec 19...). why pay for something that for the same thing as the free one? that is my main reason for scoring it 3 stars. also, the Multi touch only works for 2 keys... press 3 and nothing happens. the melody part is ok... the keys light up but it does not play it for u one time so u can get the timing right... which is important for songs one might not know... like the collection of Polish songs they have. not many people will know how they r supposed to sound. cool app for kids tho... my 16 month old loves the free one :)
0802473156|5.0|I feel my relationship could have been so much stronger and better had I read this book a long time ago. I wish I could distribute copies to everyone I know. I am looking forward to purchasing his other books and reading them. I never have been much of a reader, but I couldn't put the book down and would grab it each time I would get a chance to see what was coming up.
0439023521|2.0|Writers must never resort to a 'god from the machine' to solve issues with their plots. In Latin this is called deus ex machina, and refers to plays that use a god-like character lowered from a crane onto the stage to resolve a difficult problem by casting away the story's internal logic to solve said problem, thereby deflating all of the tension that the problem creates. It demonstrates a lack of creativity on the writer's part, and Suzanne Collins uses this weak technique no fewer than three times in this book. The first one seems almost completely intentional, because it is literally a booming voice from the sky, and it's at this moment where a good story becomes trite.  Except even before this moment, the book has problems.  I thought that I had seen the worst adverb use in dialogue attribution when my eyes happened upon \\"...I said frostily\\" in Stephanie Meyer's abysmally bad Twilight, but then I saw \\"This is it? I think grouchily\\", and I was astonished yet again at how something so awful could have been either written by an author or missed (or worse, suggested) by an editor. The Hunger Games is not as bad as Twilight, but there are times when it is difficult to take seriously. The writing is weak, it's careless, and as far as I'm concerned, it rips off the reader. Great writing is crafted and honed through multiple passes. Much of what lies on the page here is slipshod. We deserve better for the time we invest in your book. The STORY deserves better.  It's fast paced, which keeps the pages turning despite its numerous problems, but at times the pace is so fast that it feels like some really great moments could have been made better by a more careful, lingering squeeze of the scenes.  There is no good reason for this book to have been written in first person, present tense. This is a story that screams out to be written in third person, allowing for better development of all of the characters involved (not to mention the possibility that the protagonist might not survive).  Subplots are created and then ultimately left flailing in the margins (what purpose do the muttations serve?). Why does Gale become such a non-character once the protagonist is taken away to fight? Here's an idea: What if he was so worried for her safety while watching the games, that he commits a crime to get the funds to get her a parachute drop of something she needed in the woods to survive? She could learn this when she got back, that he was ultimately caught and arrested (possibly executed) as a result. At least he's no longer an empty character.  This book is ultimately a disappointment because so much of its potential is ruined. The promise The Hunger Games makes to be great in its first half is ultimately broken.
B00011ZBXY|3.0|Considering this film is based on a true story does confirm that fact is stranger than fiction. Culkin ang Green deliver stellar performances leaving you in awe of the NY party sceen through 3 decades. DJ Keoki, played by Fes (foreign exchange student from That 70's Show) also plays a key role in the film. Having seen him live and hearing about his DJ start and career really hits home with the lavish lifestyles of 24/7 party fiends. Somewhat comparable to Studio 54, this film will leave you in question of how much is too much and where that fine line is crossed from having a good time to doing whatever it takes to be the ultimate Party Monster.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Warrior, hits you in the gut, pulls at your heart and keeps you riveted to your seat from opening to closing scene. I guess for me, being I have two brothers, in an Irish household, we had our fights and love ea other dearly, but we sure had our differences and struggles, especially with themes in this movie, like alcohol abuse, anger, etc... this movie made me cry rediculous but also grabbed at me being a father of two girls myself and also reignited my desire to get back into shape and start excersising again. While I'm not a fan of UFC fights, I think it's too much about the violence or brutality more so than the actual techniques to the mixed martial arts. I AM however, intrigued by MMA techniques, especially in my new workout regimens. They're great for burning cals and shedding weight, and just jazzing yourself up to feel better. It works for me, and Warrior was AMAZING film. Probably one of the best if not THE BEST of 2011 in my opinion.   Tom Hardy Rocks in this but Gavin O Connor clearly brought us a film, much like Rocky did in the 70's and 80's, to uplift the warrior in all of us.
B004D0YB4Y|5.0|My Favorite CD of 2011.<br />If you like Soul - GET THIS ALBUM! If you like Funk - GET THIS ALBUM! If you like James Brown - GET THIS ALBUM! Real R'n'B, Real Emotion, Real Hard and Real Pretty - GET THIS ALBUM!!!
B004V2AWKG|5.0|I suppose the reason this book has no previous reviews would be because it is for a younger audience,but it is classic. For fear of giving spoilers I will make this short.  It is a very original story about a boy living in a authoritarian culture, where there is an inability for free thought. After becoming apprenticed to the town's Giver the boy begins a journey of who he is, where he belongs, and the truth about humanity.   I would recommend the book to younger readers and adults alike. It is surprising, emotional, and of all the books I've read one of the most memorable!
0439023513|1.0|The third novel, however, felt as if someone else entirely had written it. As other reviewers have noted, there was no character development and the pacing suddenly felt extremely tedious. It was a huge let down after the first two novels. I'm hopeful that when they turn the trilogy into movies that they will scrap the whole plot of the third book and take time crafting something more thoughtful and consistent with the first two.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Loved this dvd. My wife and I had recently watched the Firefly movie, Serenity, and had caught a couple of episodes here and there online or on cable. After now watching the entire series, I wish there was more! What a great show!!!!!! Memorable characters and storylines make this a unique, and highly enjoyable series!!!!! Makes me wonder if the writer(s) of Cowboys and Aliens got their story idea from Firefly!!!!!! If you're a sci-fi fan, you'll love this show!!!!!!!!!
0545265355|5.0|I love the books! I love the characters. Suzanne Collins is an excellent author. She develops the plot line and characters well. You care what happens to everyone. I couldn't get to the end fast enough and I've re-read them several times! Trust me you won't be able to put it down! the boxed set is truly worth the money. I hope the movies do them justice.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|If your want a crooner to sing you Christmas songs, this is the cd.  Mr. Buble creates the sound of times past when songs were sung, not yelled, when the song was the message, not someone showing off a five octave range.  He creates a mood and feeling that says seasons greatings.  You want to have a great hour or so, listen to the music and enjoy
B005WZZRD8|5.0|I love gaga! The remixes are great and I love having the monster ball on DVD!!! The packaging is really cool as well! Really like the cover!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great riddle game that requires no improve guess work that others, like Riven, relied on. Only problem was that it was a bit short, only a hangul of hours across several sessions.
B00000DHTF|5.0|Awsome box set from one of the greatest artist of are time. The design and sound quality is first rate. Amazon shipped out fast and packaged well.
1451648537|5.0|As a long-time participant in the Silicon Valley economy, I assumed I knew enough of Jobs' life story without investing the time to read this biography.  I was wrong.  After being harangued by a few trusted friends to read it, I did invest the  time, and it was well worth it.  A number of my colleagues are shying away from it because they suspect it's a pro-Jobs work, but in fact it struck me as a balanced insight into a fascinating person.  Highly recommended.
B0064BCNA4|1.0|I tried the application for about 20 seconds before becoming bored. I gave it to my 12 year old daughter, she played with it for a good 3 minutes before becoming bored with it. I gave it to my 8 year old and he also got bored in a couple minutes.  This program lacks the real functions of a useful digital piano, and lacks anything to keep a child interested.  Hey, it was free. No loss, no gain.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I loved this book... it is my favorite and i asked my mom to buy it for me for Christmas... i may not have an amazing poem like the other guy... but i agree with them... it is amazing... everyone, young and old, will love the story this movie has told :) couldnt help myself...
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like the option to play winning hands.  Smooth play and the ads are just a quick screen between hands-nothing very intrusive at all.  Great solitaire!
0425200450|1.0|The book was perported to be \\"NEW\\"  -  it was not. It's in fairly good condition, but the pages are brownish in color and there are many creases in the book. Not happy
B00005V9IL|5.0|Loved this movie and the extra scenes practically create a whole new ending and meaning. It was like watching it for the first time with the deleted stuff in it.
B000X107GI|4.0|good battery life, although its not top tier. Better than some of the cheaper brands out there, but not as good as bigger name brands
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very handy for sharpening things around the house but even better in the car or toolbox cause it take up very little space. Sharpens very well.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|All I can say is this is a fantastic series.  I don't have time to just catch regular series on tv on a regular basis. So I just buy the intire series season by season.  This show gets a solid 5 stars, and it looks like we will be blessed with another season.  Get it and add it to your collection.
B000K7MMP4|2.0|Meh. I'm a huge Jane Austen fan and will take her work in any form I can get it. But this version takes such liberties with the text as to be, at times, completely off track. The angsty inner monologues of Elizabeth Bennet are not only off-script, they add a tone to her character of maudlin romanticism and self-absorption that is not the Eliza Bennet I know and love.   The one brilliant portrayal here, imo, is David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy who gave me a new way to look at the character -- very convincingly in step with the sense of privilege someone of his stature would have and still sympathetic. The goofy music played every time Mr. Collins showed up is a good example of how this version takes the really wonderful subtle and clever writing of Jane Austin to an almost slapstick level at times.   Sabina Franklyn's wooden performance as Elizabeth didn't help but Priscilla Morgan's shrill excessive and intense interpretation of Mrs. Bennet was brilliant.   This was produced 30 years ago, and there have been way better versions since. If you're a huge fan it's fun to watch this just to compare it to better versions, just beware you won't quite get the book you read and loved in this version.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|if you're a fan of Final Fantasy you should not miss the chance to make this film with excellent quality.  Also highly recommended are all the extras that are included
B004G6009K|5.0|Title says it all. Best movie I ever seen, and I'm a 21 year old college student. I'm a guy so its a perfect movie for anyone! It's funny, and touching all at the same time a truly a classic. You HAVE to get it.
0670022950|5.0|I just finished this book, and it did take a while; it is a bit long, but, in addition to the great interest of the topic, quite enjoyable to read. When one finishes it, it becomes very clear that most of the people who say they found it unconvincing didn't read very much of it!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought Adele's 21 CD after hearing \\"someone like you\\" on the radio about 10 times a day. The CD is unbelievable. From the first to the last song, every lyrics and tune is just so powerful. A great gift for any lady or even man.
B0043URV5U|5.0|I really didn't know if Bob Seger would still be the Bob Seger of the 70's and 80's that I knew and loved, but I promise you; you will not be disappointed at all. If anything you will fall in love with him all over again. I put that CD on and was dancing all over the living room like I used to 30 years ago. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next!!
B001E45XT4|5.0|[[ASIN:B001E45XT4 Plantronics GameCom 367 Closed-Ear Gaming Headset]]  This was a replacement for my Plantronics GameCom 367 that I broke by stepping on it. Sound quality is great. Feel is comfortable. I can adjust it to my size, and the headphones cut out a lot of outside noise. The only issue I have is that the amplification isn't quite enough, and so when watching movies I plug it into my speakers. However, the amplification is fine on skype or webcams. I can turn the mike off when I'm doing things that don't require a mike. And I never leave it on the floor any more.  I bought the same model as previously, which rarely happens, because my ears tolerate only the highest-quality sound for music. This is also one of the less expensive headphones, so the combination of quality and price makes it a five-star recommendation.
B005J29HD0|5.0|I bought this LP yesterday and have listened to it six times since. And already I can tell you that this is one of the most musically complex, yet satisfying albums I've ever listened to. It retains much of the instrumentation utilized on Pet Sounds, but is much more musically developed. It's a much more varied record overall, especially in terms of songwriting. Moving on from the music, the two LPs are crackle-free, completely flat, and play flawlessly. The packaging is also really well done. Comes with a nice booklet with a bunch of pictures and whatnot. And the lyrics are printed on one of the record sleeves, with liner notes by Brian Wilson on the other sleeve. Overall, totally worth the money-this music is fantastic.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|This has to be the worst sequel to any good movie. Granted, the first hangover movie was hilarious, this one was a terrible rehash of the first with a small difference. When I say rehash, I mean basically the same story,same characters and actors, and almost the same ending. The difference is that the characters seemed to be going through the motions and their lines weren't funny even if they had acted the part.
1416549447|5.0|I am 65 years old and have been running for about 40 years. When I was younger I never had to worry about injuries. With age they became more frequent, which led to my interest in this book. While it is too early to tell whether applying the concepts will totally eliminate injuries, I can say that the concepts are sound. I can also say that now when I finish a run my legs feel fresh; while in the past they felt strained. With each day that I learn to more fully incorporate the principles of Chi running into my form I feel better and better both during and after the run.   I nice ripple effect is that one can apply the principles of Chi running into other aspects of one's life: for example, the posture which the book describes should be practiced at all times: not just when running.  This book is a must for anyone who likes to run or even walk.
B000O1799U|4.0|I Loved this movie! The cast was awsome and really did a great job.  The personalities of each character were realistic.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Listen I have been to one too many crowded farms.  This movie reinforced my suspiscions about mass production. Of course I love my soda and dollar menu meals, but really I have always needed a little push to break my bad habits. This movie has done it. After our fridge and freezer emptys out we are buying from the farmers market only.  Our future plans involve adding a greenhouse, composter, chickens, and goats to our property.  Convience has spoiled us all.  No wonder it's so difficult to lose weight with the crap we are buying and consuming.  I highly recommended this eye opening film to every person who shops at a supermarket instead of the farmers market.
B005D9B26E|5.0|Quadrophenia is not only a great piece of rock art, but an obligated reference to understand the youngster culture of the 60's and 70's in British middle-class communities. Pete Townshend recreates in 1973 the atmosphere of being an English mod in 1964-65 through this rock-opera. The whole work is superb and the record could be ranked among the best top-25 rock albums. The Super Deluxe Edition is a jewel for any Who fan and a great pleasure for anybody interested in both rock music and rock culture.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|good graphics. and hints work nicely when needed story seems worthy as well. better instructions for scrolling through items wood be nice.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|Alarm Clock Xtreme works like a champ! It is easy to setup and configure. For people like me who accidentally turn their alarm off every so often... This can help to eliminate that!   My personal favorite feature is the near full screen Snooze button!
B005KJZDXK|1.0|I was really looking forward to this album.  I really like Zooey's voice, and the review in the Rolling Stone was so positive...  Unfortunately, once I got it home and put it on, I thought at first that something had gone wrong with my stereo.  It sounded so muddy, downbeat, slow, and thick, infested with off-pitch notes.  But I checked the stereo, and it was fine.    The album appears to have been deliberately recorded this way.  I thought I was going to slit my wrists and we finally had to turn it off.  It's a shame, because the arrangement were very thoughtful, and I liked the ukelele and the mandolin very much.  But everyone, both singers and musicians, seemed to be constantly drifting off pitch, through each song, over and over.  The end result swings wildly between depressing and incredibly irritating.  Perhaps it was a deliberate hipster thing to travel off the correct notes.  I know that, for one, Zooey can hit the notes properly -- I've heard her do it.  In any case, do not buy this album unless you are tone-deaf or like atonal christmas music.  Personally, I can't think of anything more grating -- atonal christmas music?  Really???  We've left Iraq -- I don't want to spend Christmas in a K-hole....
B000NA1OXY|4.0|This isn't the greatest album ever made and it won't change your life, but if you like Avril and you enjoyed either of her first two it's a must-have.  She's got kind a bratty girl thing going; it's entertaining.
B0064BCNA4|3.0|The app does what it says it does. But I felt like the multi touch should have worked a little better than it did -3vo
B003R0MF5I|5.0|My husband & I fell in love with this show from the first episode. We are in our 50s and it gave us a bit of nostalgia (reminded us of Get Smart). We started buying the seasons as they became available and are so glad we did. It looks like season 5 is the last one but we will be able to enjoy this show for years to come on disc. The show has good writing and casting.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The native Kindle Fire pdf reader doesn't render scanned documents correctly, so I was forced to download this. It renders pdfs beautifully, but could definitely do with a few more features, as other reviews say.
B001CGJ3QS|2.0|Before I am branded a heretic, and although I'm not very familiar with his work, let me just say this review is NOT a negative slight on Wilhelm Kempff's technical and emotional mastery of Beethoven's Sonatas.<br /><br />It's just the tone of the piano in the recording that gets to me. I am by no means an audiophile, and I'm not the most eloquent at expressing my opinions on music. I listen to music, if it moves me, I can't explain how or why it does, but it just does. I like classical music, especially piano arrangements. I'm guilty of having what some call a generic taste in classical music and composers (Bach, Vivaldi, Mozart, Chopin, and yes, Beethoven), but to each their own, I say.<br /><br />But the tone of the piano in this recording... it sounds \\"trebly\\", for lack of a better term. It just... STABS me. Perhaps I've worn out too many compilation CDs with the usual mish-mash of Moonlight Sonato or Pathetique, but the tone of the piano on those recordings are much more softer and mellower, or even the tone of the piano of Claudio Arrau on his [[ASIN:B0000041ND Chopin: The Complete Nocturnes And Impromptus]] (which is probably my all-time favorite classical CD).<br /><br />I've never listened to other recordings of the 32 Sonatas as of yet, or Kempff for that matter. It's for the trebly sounding piano that I can't really recommend this recording.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|In my opinion, this is Em's best album ever. I love all his albums (except \\"Encore\\"), and I still think this is his best.  I even liked \\"Relapse\\", which many fans did not. However, I can still tell he was just getting off drugs, and it was a hard period for him during \\"Relapse\\". But with \\"Recovery\\", he comes back full-throttle.  1. Cold Wind Blows (10/10): Kick-ass song. It is the perfect opener for the album. It shows that Em is back on track, and that this is his real return. He goes hard on this song, and it is definitely the kind of song that makes me want to get up and dance (but I don't, because I'm a terrible dancer. Take my word for it).  2. Talkin' 2 Myself (10/10): Very personal song from Em. He opens the song by thanking the fans for baring with him over the past few years. He talks about the struggles he went through during his hiatus. He even talks about almost dissing Lil Wayne due to his jealousy. The song is all-around great, and the chorus sung by Kobe is catchy and perfectly fitting.  3. On Fire (2/10): I've never liked this song from my first listen, and I've listened to it many times in attempt to like it, but I just can't. The beat is boring, and it doesn't go anywhere. The lyrics are good, but the song is just boring. The chorus is quite weak, as well.  4. Won't Back Down (4/10): When I first heard Em and P!nk were collaborating on a track, I thought to myself \\"Oh no\\". Well, I still feel that way. Although the song has pretty good lyrics and Em goes pretty hard on this track, P!nk ruins the track for me. The chorus is obnoxious and doesn't fit the beat at all. In fact, I also think the beat is a bit too loud and obnoxious, as well.  5. W.T.P (10/10): Hey, welcome back Shady! But really, this is the first song on the album where I believe Shady makes a full return (though I think the Slim Shady persona was partially present in Cold Wind Blows). A very old-school Eminem track. Very catchy chorus, simple but very clean-sounding beat, and awesome lyrics.   6. Going Through Changes (9/10): I had to let this one grow on me a bit, but I love it now. I mainly had to let the chorus grow on me, not so much Em's verses. It is a very personal song about Em turning his life around, and the struggles of doing so.  7. Not Afraid (10/10): I'll never forget when my friend Ryan sent me this song. It was the first song I heard from \\"Recovery\\". I can't lie, it almost brought me to tears. It was this song that made me think \\"Finally, Eminem is back for good\\". I felt so proud of Em, and his maturing was extremely evident in this song. It is all-around amazing, and I love the fact that he reaches out to his fans.  8. Seduction (8/10): A pretty good song. This was another grower for me, but I do enjoy the track now. However, it is definitely not my favorite on the album. Very sexual song with great lyrics, but the beat seems to be lacking a bit. Still, a good track.  9. No Love (8/10): Now let me just clear this up: I am no Lil Wayne fan by any stretch of the means. However, he does a *passable* job on this track. The choice on sampling Hathaway on a rap song was a very interesting one. However, here it works well.  10. Space Bound (10/10): One of my very favorites on the album. I'll never forget the night I was in a car accident with my friend Tom. It was only days after \\"Recovery\\" was released, and this song was playing. Since then, I've been extremely attached to this song. I love the guitar work in it, Em's verses are tight, and the chorus is amazing. Just a beautiful song. Love it.  11. Cinderella Man (10/10): Another very Slim Shady-esque song. The beat is simple yet very catchy, and it has some great lines. Another one of those songs that just makes you want to get up and dance.  12. 25 To Life (9/10): Great chorus, great lyrics about the whole rap-game. I don't really have much to say about this one, it's just a great song.  13. So Bad (10/10): This is the most old-school Eminem track here. I've loved this song from thefirst listen. The lyrics are awesome, but what I really love is the chorus. It has a very mellow feel to it, and has some nice guitar work in there. I just love this song over-all.  14. Almost Famous (9/10): Great song about when Eminem was starting out, and he could feel himself reaching fame. Pretty much that \\"Almost there!\\" feeling.  15. Love The Way You Lie (9/10): A song about a dysfunctional relationship. Em shows some great anger here, and Rhianna's chorus is very fitting.  16. You're Never Over (10/10): A very heartfelt tribute to Proof. Although the chorus is a bit weak, it doesn't matter. The meaning is there 110%. A very nice tribute, and I'm sure Proof is proud of Em for having the bravery to release this song.   17. Untitled (8/10): Almost sounds like a freestyle. It has great lyrics, and Eminem is pretty much on fire, but the song itself doesn't seem to go anywhere. I mean it isn't terrible, but it's not my favorite here. Then again, I wasn't even aware that this song was on the album when I bought it, so I can't complain. Still decent.   18. Ridaz [Bonus Track] (9/10): Pretty good song. Not a slower song, but it is somewhat slower-paced. Has a simple beat, but it is catchy. Has a catchy chorus, as well.  19. Session One [Bonus Track] (10/10): Really bouncing track here. This one took quite a few listens before I liked it, but I like it alot now. It is a hard track, and Slaughterhouse does a very good job on this track.  Welp, that's my honest opinion on \\"Recovery\\". Take care!
B000XAE3IM|2.0|Battery works on my sony SLT-A77 but does not display the life span of the battery.  I don't like taking that kind of risk but, you get what you pay for. I will run a test on it and see how it does for me tomorrow. I hope I can get the same amount of shots or more than the factory battery. the voltage on it is 7.4 where the SONY is 7.2 . I hope this will not cause a problem for my camera.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|We all have that fantasy world when we are children of a getaway place only children know about. The Secret Garden represents that place where kids can be kids and remember loved ones who had passed as well. This was a very nice movie. I got teary-eyed watching it. I found this movie totally by accident. I was looking up movies that may be similar to Anne Of Green Gables. If you enjoy movies of that type I believe you will really enjoy this movie.
B0064BCNA4|5.0|I downloaded Little Piano (pro) to my Kindle Fire, and it installed and ran just fine. The developer's description says: &#34;Little Piano (pro) is perfect for kids' little fingers and makes a great introduction to piano-playing for those who don't read music.&#34; I agree with that. I don't play any musical instruments, but it was pretty easy (and fun) to knock out a few tunes on the large keyboard. Better still, two of our young nieces were with us this morning, since they're out of school for Christmas. They had a great time playing &#34;Jingle Bells&#34; and &#34;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&#34; on the keyboard.<br /><br />The app includes about two dozen songs that can be played by touching whichever key is highlighted. There are also five different instruments to choose from, including piano, trumpet, guitar, bells, and percussion. Piano is by far the best and most realistic sound, at least to my ears.<br /><br />Little Piano doesn't claim to be a comprehensive piano emulator. With only one octave and fourteen keys (8 white, 6 black), the music that can be produced is limited. The app is rated &#34;Children,&#34; which is defined by Amazon as ages 9 and younger, so I think that's how it should be evaluated. With that in mind, I have no problem giving Little Piano a 5-star rating.

B003YBUSMW|5.0|I bought one of these. Love it.  Doesn't have force feedback but I don't care.  For how much I am going to be driving(a few hours every other day)it is more than ok.  So much so that I have another on on order and expect to receive it today.  I am curious about the force feedback ones but Formula One 2011 is hard enough on expert without force feedback.  So no complaints here. So Far So good.  I don't use the gear stick, I use the paddles which is better anyway.  For $150 you can't go wrong. Showed another guy at work and he has ordered one as well.  The only thing that I might say negative is that it takes 3 batteries and I have used them up in about 3-4 weeks.  Re-chargable batteries might help me there, will see how I go.  But if you have any doubts, I reckon they will disappear once you receive the wheel.  Good Job Mad Catz (So Far)

B005JLN9ZI|5.0|This is possibly the best CD of 2011.  It is great from beginning to end.  Everything down to the order of the songs is perfect.  Drake can sometimes get a little boring to listen to when he puts to many slow tempo songs back-to-back, but on Take Care, he mixes tempos, styles, and blends everything together to form a near perfect album!
B001DIDUHS|5.0|Amazing album by Sabbath. I'm a huge Ozzy/Dio fan, however, this album probably is the best album since Mob Rules, and definately the best album during the Tony Martin era. Every song on this album is awesome, with the exception of intro first track. I don't know why songs like \\"Headles Cross,\\" \\"Call Of The Wild,\\" and \\"When Death Calls\\" aren't considered as important to Sabbath's catalogue as songs Like \\"Paranoid\\" or \\"Heaven & Hell.\\" Tony Iommi's guitarwork still stands out on this album. Definately a hard rocking album, with catchy tunes. I actually was able to find a used copy of this album thankfully. This album blows away it's 3 predacessors \\"Born Again,\\" \\"7th Star,\\" and \\"Eternal Idol.\\" I think had this album come after \\"Live Evil\\" it would have been more successful. True diamond in the rough, and it's a shame it's now out of print. Must have for the die hard Sabbath fan.

0312330537|2.0|Shantaram is written on an epic scale, 2\\" thick, 900 pages, in five parts.  And it's the first book in a planned trilogy.  I would have written it in two parts, or better yet, two books around 200 pages each.  The first half is the better of the two, a tale of an escaped felon (not an ex--he's on the lam) with a big heart, who settles in among the bohemians and slums on the edge of circa 1980's Bombay.  It is here that the flavor of the book is at its fullest, most compelling (although saying \\"compelling\\" is a bit of a stretch).  This book tells us of life in urban, and rural India;  it explains the title, introduces us to a broad range of characters and ends in tragedy.  Picking up from the tragedy, the second half begins with a month long heroin binge and then heads off on an ill considered foray taking arms into Soviet occupied Afghanistan where the book becomes more of an action story and less of a people story.<br /><br />It turns out that Lin, our protagonist (based on the author) is about as needy as Elizabeth Gilbert (\\"Eat Pray Love\\") but instead of all the pissing and moaning and meditation,  Lin does more manly things, like petty crime, major felonies, drugs and lots of fighting.  And by the end of the book he's professing his love to, or about, more men than a gay romantic novel, and he's straight.<br /><br />Roberts does pretty good in the grammar department.  I read a lot of non-fiction by some eminent professorial types and it's quite common to be distracted by silly grammatical mistakes, like an accidental change of tense, mid-paragraph; or obscure words that get repeated often enough to derail your focus.  His ability to write the East Indian way of speaking English makes many of the conversations in the first half of the book a joy to read, but those voices are all but non-existant in the second half.  Worse, where his grammar carries the story, his descriptions run into deep purple ink.  Night can not merely fall, hair can not be just black, everything must be wrapped in metaphors.  Sometimes he nails it, but he gets so carried away in descriptions that after a while I just skipped through them.  Sad, because when big things happen, like when he finally gets Karla into bed (not a spoiler) the sex scene sinks in the weight of its words.<br /><br />But, for a book of this size with the promise of adventure that it offers,  it reads more like a reminiscence than nail biting suspense.  I would imagine the reason for this is that much of the stuff he did counts as a serious crime in several countries, and some of the crimes went across international borders which may not invoke the statute of limitations, and thus leave him open to further incarceration.  Whatever the case, much of the actual risk, danger and adventure is referred to after it happens, without a lot of detail and is not a part of the story.  Imagine Indiana Jones narrating the fight in the runaway ore cars, standing in front of one, but not actually seeing the chase in action;  that's how much of Shantaram reads, aside from the gun battles in the mountains of Soviet occupied Afghanistan, towards the end of the book.<br /><br />It must be really hard to serve hard time in a prison where the guards are as criminal as the inmates;  to escape addiction, fight relapsing, and to face all the slings and hurt of life, I credit Roberts for that.  On the other hand, when he's faced with sadness and tragedy he too often gravitates to violence and drugs, which would seem to be the source of much of his troubles, beginning with his failed marriage.  It appears the author has finally  mastered his shortcomings, yet I didn't find the reading about it any more entertaining than wading through Ms. Gilbert's whining, but at least \\"Eat Pray Love\\" was written as a more conventionally sized novel, not a 900 page ball busting read.  The thought that this is meant to be a trilogy would be scary if I felt that I needed to continue with the story, but, fortunately I have other books I want to read and will wait for the movie.

0525423281|4.0|I'm having a hard time with this one.  I really did LIKE the book, but I wasn't over the moon about it.  There were some things that really bothered me, but I would say that the last 1/3 of the book more than made up for it.<br /><br />First of all, I really liked Anna and the French Kiss - I thought it was a sweet book and it was so fun to read.  I liked all of Anna & St. Clair's little personality traits - I thought it made the characters seem more real.<br /><br />Having said that, I found that all of the little details about both Lola and Cricket were just too much.  I enjoyed the fact that the story took place in San Francisco (in the Castro district, no less) and that Lola was the product of a teenage/addict mother and was raised by 2 fathers - her gay uncle and his partner.  I felt that added some much needed depth to her character.  I thought some of her other traits were a little overkill - her constant costumes, wigs, ridiculous outfits, etc.  Would a teenage girl in this day and age create an elaborate Marie Antoinette gown to wear to her school's dance?  Probably not.  Her friend Lindsey's obsession with Nancy Drew and other detectives was also a bit much - especially when you learn her bedroom wall is painted Nancy Drew spine yellow.  And Cricket - where to start with him.  First off, his name is ridiculous.  And his off beat wardrobe, constant wearing of rubberbands and bracelets (do guys really wear bracelets anymore?), the fact that he always writes notes on his hand, and his obsession with tinkering with different inventions.  Don't get me wrong, some of it is OK, but it seems like the author took a class on creative writing and making characters come to life and it told her to incorporate little \\"ticks\\" or \\"quirks\\" into her characters to make them more appealing, but she went way overboard with it.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me - and I hate to admit it - but Anna and St. Clair really annoyed me in this book.  The thing that I loved so much about them in the first book (which is listed as a companion to this novel) is that their relationship wasn't perfect and it felt so real.  Now in this book, suddenly they are living this cookie cutter life and are so in love with each other and it's really just annoying.<br /><br />Now, having said all that, I still gave this book 4 stars.  About halfway through, I was kind of over the whole thing, but then it picked up and I really enjoyed the last half of the book.  Even though I spent a lot of time pointing out things that I didn't like, ultimately I enjoyed the story as a whole.  It is a young adult book, which may account for some of the issues I had with it, but Stephanie Perkins definitely has a gift for creating characters that you want to root for.  I do look forward to reading more from this author.t book (which is listed as a companion to this novel) is that their relationship wasn't perfect and it felt so real.

B00631VJIC|4.0|From what I can tell, from the SOA website and my own recollections, having watched every episode, there have been 300 songs featured in the background of scenes, (from a low of 1 song in episode 14/4 to a high of 14 songs in episode 8/3), by a wide variety of artists, from Love and Andy Williams, The Andrews Sisters and Dusty Springfield, Beck and Joan Armatrading, to new lights on the horizon like the Black Keys and Gary Clark Jr. With only 13 episodes per \\"season\\" (14 in the 4th season, mostly due to a change caused by NOT being cancelled), a total of 53, that makes an average of a little more than 5 songs per.  One song was played each episode, at the beginning and each commercial break, but not credited on the site music tab:  \\"This Life\\" the theme song by Curtis Stigers & The Forest Rangers.  The Forest Rangers appear on many of the songs, with different lead singers, doing a credible job of updating songs from decades ago, even once being noted in a Spanish version of the name.    With that much to draw on, how is it this collection is limited to only 14 songs?  It should be a double CD, or called Vol 1. Of the 14, 4 of them credited to Katey Sagal, Kurt Sutter's partner, whose breathy voice is appropriate to the songs she delivers.  As other writers have noted, some of the more unique songs didn't make the cut, including a few of my own favorites.  Sadly, this CD is like the show itself, limited to the typical 12 episode run that's become the norm on the alt-TV of USA, FX, TNT and AMC.  Although that kind of thinking may allow the sponsoring network a financial cushion, to protect them from a bomb, it imposes an artificial deadline that limits the length of a story arc, and seriously affects attention-span of the audience.  I've stopped watching several programs because I get tired of wondering if it's on, have I seen it, etc.  Add to that distraction the fact they're already saying the next \\"season\\" of SOA will be its last.  After only what, 65 episodes?  That's just anemic, it's so pitiful.  Whomever is making decisions at the network should be working at the local 7-11.  That's more than enough responsibility for someone with that kind of thinking ability.  SOA could be hitting well over a hundred episodes, if anyone even had a clue at FX.  Of course, anyone with any brains has already left for something better, anywhere else.

0060936223|5.0|a sweet sad memory of and evocation of life on the fringes of the New York art and music world in the time of Warhol and his entourage, Hendrix, Dylan, Joplin, Shepherd - and, eventually, of Patti Smith's almost accidental transformation from performance poet to the soulful, cathartic queen of punk rock. we taste the world, meet the people, see and smell the places: chelsea hotel, max's kansas city, the bottom line, the gritty streets - all through the senses of a young passionate fearless bohemian girl who dwelt quietly along the edges, whose faith in the deity of art surpassed and eclipsed the fame and success hunger felt by many of her peers. patti loved with a pure heart. she was and is the real deal.  above all it is the story of her love for a boy. a boy who was lover, friend and soul mate. patti gave herself over to this love, blood and bones, heart and soul, with eyes wide open and no judgements. if there is an unkind word about anyone in this book i don't remember it. she tells it like she saw it, and the eyes she saw it with were those of an artist who has little patience for bs, but not a judge who rules on morals or propriety. 'art must be convulsive or not at all' - smith quoted rimbaud on an album cover. this book show's patti's early commitment to that sensibility, but more than that it shows, i'd guess unexpectedly to those who do not know her well, a woman who knows how to love. the book is a lesson in love. love pours from every page.

B000286S8S|3.0|Let's remember one thing about Van Halen, shall we?  No matter how many \\"hits\\" the band had later in life, the initial salvo of music from the Roth era featured many tracks that got played to DEATH on FM rock radio.  The first Van Halen album came roaring through speakers all over America in the form of \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love,\\" \\"Eruption/You Really Got Me,\\" \\"Runnin' With The Devil,\\" \\"Jamie's Cryin\\"...all of which are represented here, but what about the CLASSIC \\"Little Dreamer?\\" What about \\"Ice Cream Man?\\"   And the second album! If I had a nickel for every time \\"D.O.A.\\" as played on FM radio, I'd have cars in my garage that look like the ones belonging to Sammy and Eddie.  And what about \\"Diver Down,\\" the album critics slammed for being too short and too heavy on cover tunes? We get the band's cover of \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" (which is reasonable) and \\"Dancing In The Streets\\" (which was a PALE shadow of the original and one of the weakest tracks on the album.  It's not the idea that every album had to be \\"equally represented,\\" either. \\"Balance\\" gets two tracks (and some fans of the band might tell you that's two tracks too many). Who knows WHAT they were thinking? The first thing I did with my copy was import it into iTunes and re-arrange it into to playlists...one Roth, one Hagar, both in chronological order. I suspect that I am not alone when it comes to that activity.  Want \\"Humans Being?\\" Better cough up some extra gold doubloons for the \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD. Likewise for the two new Roth tracks that appeared there.  You get 58 minutes of Roth-era Van Halen and 98 minutes of Van Hagar. What that adds up to is a finished product that might not necessarily represent \\"The Best OF Both Worlds.\\" 16 minutes' worth of the Van Hagar 98 comes from Sammy doing cover versions of Roth-era tracks on \\"Live: Right Here Right Now.\\" This is the point where the majority of Van Halen fans might ask \\"Couldn't they have reached into the vaults and come up with three Roth-era live tracks FEATURING Roth?\\" Of course, that's a moot point following this CD's release. They could have, but they didn't.  The three new songs aren't exactly crown jewels, either. \\"It's About Time\\" is a random, run-of-the-mill Sammy rant bonded to an Eddie riff that was probably laying on the cutting room floor (some Van Halen biographers have made this claim, and I'm not inclined to doubt it). Same for \\"Up For Breakfast\\"...it starts off with some interesting Eddie antics, but by the time Sammy comes in, it sounds pretty much like every other Hagar-era Van Halen rocker. \\"Learning To See\\" is the required mid-tempo track, with guitars a little too heavy to classify it as a \\"ballad\\"...Eddie goes nuts on the solo. It's probably the most interesting song of the three simply because it doesn't sound as much like an \\"outtake\\" as the other tracks...but it's just not THAT interesting. None of the three new tracks are the equal of the \\"hits.\\"  The non-live, non-\\"bonus track\\" section of the Hagar years clocks in at 68 minutes. You have all of the keyboard-heavy \\"hits\\"...none are missing...and the loud tracks like \\"Poundcake\\" and \\"Black And Blue.\\"  And I know people are sick of hearing about the fact that this can't be \\"The Best Of BOTH Worlds\\" when it completely omits the Gary Cherrone debacle, but the band chose to re-write history, and our choice is to deal with it or not buy the CD.  I have to believe that most serious Van Halen fans already own the original CDs, and the real draw here is the 3 new Hagar tracks.  So this turkey came out 2004, in and in 2011...16 years after \\"Balance\\"...their last full studio album...the band has reportedly signed a new recording contract with plans to release a new Roth-fronted album next year (and Hagar claims ALL of the tracks are outtakes that Eddie is re-working).   It is what it is...but there are definitely better ways of getting your Van Halen fix. This CD will show you everything you need to know about what's been \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" with this band for DECADES.

1594489505|4.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns - Khaled Hosseini - n. A Leoni<br />Audio version  performed by - Atossa Leoni<br />4 stars<br /><br />This story did not feel like contemporary fiction. Surely such brutal treatment of women is something centuries in the past!<br />Of course, it is not. Not in Afghanistan at the turn of the 21st century.<br />The story begins in the 1970's with Mariam, the illegitimate daughter of an epileptic housemaid.  Mariam and her mother have a marginal existence, branded by the shame of her birth. With her mother's death, the teen-aged Mariam is forced into marriage with Rasheed, an abusive stranger. More than 20 years later, in the midst of political upheaval and war, Rasheed takes another teenaged wife, the recently orphaned, Laila.<br />Initially household rivals, Mariam and Laila develop a deep relationship that provides what little stability and comfort they are able to achieve.<br /><br />The story of these two women gives an insider's view of recent Afghani history. Beginning with the Russian occupation, they suffer through civil war, the Taliban regime and its eventual post 9/11 overthrow.  It is a story of sacrifice and survival. I found it to be very moving.
0345505387|2.0|To begin with I did not realize that a \\"graphic\\" novel was a glorified comic book.  Jamie and Claire did not look like I envision them.  Claire looked like a \\"chuckie\\"  too voluptuous, hair the wrong color.  I see her more like a young Emma Thompson.  Jamie was too pretty.  I see him as more like Mel Gibson, more rugged.  The artist was not that good either.  Half the time I couldn't tell Collum, Dougal, Jamie, Murtagh and Kenneth (whoever he is) apart.  Gellie should look like your concept of Claire, dark hair.  He also doesn't know the anatomy of animals.  Most of the horses looked mad and their hooves looked malformed.  I love the Outlander series but this, for me was a flop.
B006II7SGW|5.0|I remember first going to see Kung Fu Panda in theaters with light expectations; it was a kids movie about a bear, he falls down a lot, very funny if you're in the first grade. But, in watching the movie, I also remember being entirely impressed with the depth of message, the placid script, amazing soundtrack, and the number of beautifully dramatic shots. Needless to say, I became a fan.   When Kung Fu Panda was released in 3D, I was excited, and my excitement was not in vain. This movie's action shots, slow motion shots, and other elements make it the perfect 3D movie. If I didn't know that the original wasn't made for 3D, in watching this, I never would have known.   I can't believe I'm saying this, but it actually makes the movie better.

B006ANJ4BW|1.0|This movie was awful... Really, I wish I could say something good about it, I saw it twice to try and find something redeeming, but the cold fact is there isn't anything. Begrudgingly, I must list what's wrong with it.  1. Who is Conan and why do we care?  The movie starts out with some stupid action scene where we're shown how awesome little kid Conan is, after being shown that he is the classic runt of the group. This is conflicting storytelling, but I won't split hairs. We then go into a training sequence where we are shown Conan's one character flaw: his temper. This isn't really important because it's never really brought up as a problem in the rest of the movie. The nice thing about a character flaws i that it not only gives the main character something to overcome, but it also gives the audience a way of connecting with the character. If this element is absent, it makes the story foreign to a real audience, and ultimately uninteresting.  After the village no one in the audience cares about is attacked, this bad guy gets the final piece of a mask that's powerful, I guess. The father sacrifices his life for Conan, which is as close to touching as you can get in this movie. After that Conan is basically a grown up. He has a group of people with him and he hates slave traders for some reason that's never explained. We, the audience have no idea why adult Conan is who he is. He's just some guy who fights people.  2. Booooooobs  There are a lot of boobs in this movie, and the actors they belong to have the acting integrity of bad porn stars. The most notable boobs.... I mean actress of this bunch is our leading lady, Ms. Idontcareabouthername shewontbefamousanyway. Playing Conan's romantic opposite, they're romantic element to the movie goes like this: Conan kidnaps her, kills people in front of her, tells her she looks like a whore, and suddenly she loves him. You may be thinking that I'm skipping over a huge element of their relationship, but the sad thing is I'mreally not; that's as deep as it goes.  3. Oh Jesus.... The tower....  So of all of the plot holes in this train wreck they call a movie, by far the most obvious and horrible is the tower scene. In order to save his lady love, Conan the horrible actor... I mean Barbarian... must break into the tower of the evil guy. So with the help of a pointless character, he finds a pretty exposed door leading into a dungeon, for some reason. Suddenly the find themselves wading through water that seems to be about 4 feet deep. Despite this, this shallow water holds an octopus monster that is huge. The two are dragged underwater at one point and the 4 feet suddenly are 20... I don't think I can make the problem any more obvious than that. So after kind of fighting this monster(Conan just kinda swings his sword a little) they suddenly find themselves at the top of this tower. That's right, the octopus was the only thing guarding the place. At the top of the tower Conan and the other guy look down to see Conan's lady being dragged across an extremely exposed area, right next to the sea. Then he says that he'd better get down there... Okay, so climbing the tower was pointless? Not only was it unnecessary,  but apparently he can get to the bottom just like that?! I was pretty much done with this movie right about at the tower of pointlessness.  But I continued to watch...  4. The mask that does.... Um... Something....  The mask of terrible power turns out to be a mask of terribly boring power. The bad guy puts it on and runs around going &#34;Yarg!&#34; until Conan kills him. That's about all I need to say.  5. The ending.  Literary study lesson for any idiot who liked this movie: When a writer forms a story, he/she is engaging in a contract with their audience. In order to have a satisfying story, you must tie up the loose ends, and give a conclusion that is of an equal value to the struggle your main character has been put through. Ask a professor of literature if you don't believeme. In the end, Conan, doesn't get the girl, no longer has a gang of rag tag rapscallions, and hasn't really learned anything. There isn't really any reason for this, either. He chooses to be alone, and the movie ends with him standing in the ruins of his village. If I didn't think the movie had a point before seeing this scene, the ending confirms how pointless the plot is. I would say this is a spoiler, but I think the movie spoils itself well enough on its own.  &#34;But Blair, I'm only going to this movie for the action...&#34;  Sorry, little Jimmy. The action is just as mindnumbingly pointless as the rest of the film.  There is really nothing good about this movie.  Acting = 1 Special effects = 1.5 Dialog = 1 Action = 1 Plot = &#34;What plot?&#34; Camera shots = Linear and static 3D = -20  I do owe Conan something though. From now on, whenever I go to a bad movie I can always say: &#34;Well, it wasn't as bad as Conan...&#34;
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Been a fan of Linkin Park for quite some time so I was quite eager to hear this direction of their musical journey.  I had heard from several others the negative opinions of this album however when it comes to music I reserve the right to form my own thoughts.  This album is not for you if you are just looking for an album of 4-5 minute standard tracks as you would normally get.  It is mixed with some interludes and some wandering thoughts.  It is by all means an artistic album and one of experimentation. Linkin Park simply allows us to go on that journey with them.  It is actually quite good with several songs that are the familiar Linkin Park sound but there are new background additions that add to the mix.  You have to listen to the album from cover to cover and simply be open to going on a journey of discovery and through it you will find yourself questioning the world around you.  If you are just looking for a typical rock album...not for you but if you are looking for an album of artful exploration with some great tunes then this one will not disappoint.  I can think of many experimental 'rock' albums that were misunderstood but endured. For the naysayers....they have their opinions and are entitled to them but music is a personal connection with your soul so be open to go to new places.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|I bought this for my brother to play in his dvd player.  I figured he could play the digital version and if he ever gets blu ray in the future he'd be all set.  But, it turns out he can't play it in his dvd player.  Back it goes.  What a waste.  It made the gift a flop for the holidays.  I felt bad.
B004TI5N38|1.0|I generally enjoy David Baldacci's novels, and got this book out of my local bookstore, but after reading part of it I just gave up, it was so bad. I wish I could have given it a \\"zero\\" rating, as \\"1\\" is too high a rating for it! This is an insipid attempt to copy Lee Child's excellent novels with his hero Jack Reacher. Puller is a pale immitation of Reacher and wouldn't last 15 seconds with him in a head-to-head brawl. In the same vein, Lee Child obliterates (writing wise) Baldacci on a straight comparison between the two novels. Result: KO of Baldacci by Child, no contest. It's a shame that a good writer like David Baldacci has stooped so low as to plagerise another author's \\"theme\\" as he seems to have completely run out of ideas! Shame on him for writing, if he did, such drivel? What a waste of money! I should have waited for our public library to get it, and at least I would not have wasted my hard-earned money on such trash! Ah!, well I can at least give it to our Church Christmas sale, at least they might get a few bucks for it!

B0000CF35G|5.0|One of the best rock albums of my lifetime.  I can only guess how many hours I've worked in the shop listening to this album over the years.  This album truly fits in the category of \\"they don't make them like this anymore.\\"  Love this album and couldn't believe I found it on vinyl, great day!

0385535139|5.0|I have been an advid reader of John's since the beginning and most of the novels have been what look for in suspense...then he went off the mark.  But, I must say The Litigators has brought him back again.  What a great read...you think you know where it's going and then...twist...you think you have it figured out again...twist!  It was fun to cheer on David.  Thanks for another interjection of your real writing abilities John!!!  Now let's keep it going -- I'm ready for the next one...
B0055MBQOM|5.0|The ColorMunki Display is a less expensive version of the i1 Display Pro. It comes bundled with a simpler vendor software and has longer measurement times compared to the i1 Display Pro. Apart from that, the instrument appears to be virtually identical.They are all colorimeter,but they can all work well for wide gamut displays just like spectrometer.If you want to calibration your displays, it is a wise choice!By the way,Dispcalgui is a excellent software^_^ The included software is easy to use but the function is too little.
0240815807|5.0|This book is an introduction to musical mixing designed for small studio engineers.  Smart is a professional engineer and author of Sound on Sound's popular Mix Rescue column.  In this book, he provides in-depth information about numerous mixing topics for small studio engineers.  Topics covered include: selecting and using studio monitors, mix preparation, balance, compression, EQ, reverb, and delays.  At the end of most chapters is a short list of suggested assignments that could be used by students for whom the book is an assigned text, or by general readers to deepen their understanding of the material.  The book is illustrated with black and white photographs and screen captures from various digital editing software.  End material includes a list of well-known studio engineers and their key projects.<br /><br />I found this book highly informative as well as concisely written and easy to follow.  Along with his description of technical details, Smart provides his own analysis of why the topics are important, and how they fit in to creating top quality mixes.  From the outside, mixing can be a highly mysterious and complicated craft, and the information that appears on various websites is often contradictory and useless.  On the web, you are told to set EQ at specified levels for different instruments or genres, always use compression and reverb for vocals, and pan instruments all over the stage.  In this book, Smart explains that the mix starts with listening, and then with careful adjustments to to bring out the best balance possible, that there are no hard and fast settings that will work every time.  He sums the mixing task up in one sentence near the end of the book \\"Your business as the mix engineer is to direct the listener's attention toward what is most important in the track at any given instant.\\"  With that in mind, the rest of book provides details about tools you can use to achieve your goals of directing the listener's attention effectively.  This is an excellent book, well worth reading for anyone who works with multi-track musical recordings.ellent book, well worth reading for anyone who works with multi-track musical recordings.

B004RMNOW8|5.0|Boy in the Striped Pajamas was a thrilling book. I as a kid in 8th grade won't be reading as small as a book that this was (216 pages) but seen the movie so I deicided to just read it. I find this book overall really good because books tell more than the movie did. Therefore, I mean some parts weren't in the movie that were in the book. I actually learned more, I learned when Bruno and Shmuel was born, Shmuel's life before he came to the camp named Out-With (As Bruno pronounces it) and things going on between Bruno's mum and Lieutenant Kotler. But I was a little disappointed at how the book end but, that's my fault because I watched the movie first. Overall The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was a very good book. I would so recommened this book to everyone no matter how old you are. :) GREAT BOOK !!!!!!!!
B003V4AK8E|3.0|the controller is good i do like the feel to it.

B0068AWQQ2|5.0|I read on here (right before the disc was available for sale) that this movie was not all that great, so I didn't buy it. Well seeing as how Amazon has given me credit towards instant videos I decided to watch it. From the beginning to the end something is going on, not like in the original where it was slow in the beginning and then picked up. Also Chris Sarandon (The original Jerry)made a cameo appearance in this film. Colin Farrell did an amazing job as Jerry and Evil Ed was great also. I can't believe that I slept on this movie because of a few bad reviews from others. I won't really say much about the movie, except there were some intense moments, but all in all I loved this movie! Also they changed Peter Vincent around and it was a good decision especially for this decade. Back in the 80s the late night horror host worked but it wouldn't fly now. I wasn't too sure how the Chris Angel version would work, but it did......watch this movie.

B00005JKJA|1.0|Mulholland Drive is certainly intriguing and the lesbian scene is one of the best ever, however I've seen this film at least 10 times thinking I'd assign my own meaning(s) to it (and I have) but I now have come to the realization that Lynch pulled the wool over everyone's eyes.  To find out why this is, go to wikipedia and check out the extensive discussion about the film and you'll learn that it was intended as a TV pilot and eventual TV mini-series.  With that knowledge in hand it is easy to see that the end result was NOT the mind-blowing, surrealistic ride of a film genius (i.e. Lynch) ... rather it's just a number of scenes intended for an extended TV series that were cobbled together with an additional $7 million of additional filming ... sad but true.  I'm a film lover and student of film (studied editing in college) but Lynch's Mulholland Drive is a not the masterful suspense film that many viewers here believe ... rather, it's just a fake (albeit one I like) that sucked us in and has kept us guessing ... just my humble opinion
B001UV4XIS|1.0|Ultraviolet is a waste of thought. You have to create an account with some second tier upstart and watch all the movies on THEIR software system. I have made it a point to avoid purchasing any movie with ultraviolet digital copies. I would highly suggest you do the same.

B000VBIGD6|5.0|One of the funniest Christmas movies ever made. It is one I have watched over and over anytime it was on cable. Now I have my own copy to watch whenever I feel like it. No matter how many time I watch it I find myself laughing out loud. Thank you Amazon.
B0068TJLSY|1.0|No wonder the trailer was extremely vague, they had to spark SOME interest and trick people into watching this film. And everyone would have just thought, 'oh, an E.T. remake'. Some Remakes can be tweaked and great, but this movie was horrible. The expectations were high considering the producer and director. What a let down. The story line was just like in E.T., the only thing different was E.T. was like E.T. on meth and steroids. Catch this film if it's available on redbox for $1 or when it plays on tv, but definitely not worth the $3.99 and anticipation. If you hate movies that are really quiet when you need to hear what is being said, then obnoxiously and unnecessarily loud, definitely avoid this one. The cinematography was also horrible.   Really hated this film and I love Sci-Fi. What a disappointment.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am only about 1/3 through this book, but find I can't put it down.  Since I started with it, I felt pulled into the character's lives and want to know what happens to them.  The topic of time travel, and how it is portrayed in this book, makes me really think things through.  I am loving this book so far, and can't wait to finish it.  Great job, Mr. King.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|I purchased this movie from Amazon.com on 25Nov11, received it 10Dec11 and have already watched it a dozen times. Why so many times? I want to be as fair and balanced in my review as I possibly can be. The only thing I didn't like about this film is the fact that the main characters were not \\"fleshed out\\" more. I know the reason is due to time constraints. But when I think I of what the character Tyler had to say about true love and it being \\"EPIC\\" it just made me wish that the movie could have been on an epic scale of at least 2hrs 30/45mins instead of being just under 2hrs. With that in mind I now find that I will need to read the book in order to get \\"The Full Monty\\" on Elena & Peyton's \\"Against All Odds\\" love journey. Now the things that I truly loved about the film. First, Conn's spot on choice in female co-leads. Never have I seen two actresses so convincing on screen that you would swear that it was no act. The chemistry was through the roof on this one. I think to have this these ladies had to have \\"connected\\" on a personal level in order to evoke such restraint and passion in these geniune characters. There are some actors that are so convincing in their performance that it makes one wonder if that aspect was not already there. Now it is known that Traci is bi-sexual and Necar is straight (I promise Necar, I will not hold it against you), but I think that Necar is no stranger to a woman's touch. I have since looked at both Necar and Traci's filmographies and I am really impressed with their past performances. They are really an attestment to their craft. Second, I really enjoyed Peyton's stand up friend Wave. Every lesbian should have a buddy like her. Lastly, I appreciate the fact the Conn knew to use just the right amount of love scenes (however, I did enjoy the extended director's cut). They were not overdone, over the top, campy, cliche' nor did they come off as porno. This is a love story and a beautiful one at that. My favorite scence is was when Elena steels herself and says, \\"Peyton, make love to me.\\" That sentence had the intensity Category 5 & a 10.2. And for her to say it twice and then to proclaim that she doesn't \\"want to go back\\"...MOMMA MIA!!! The \\"undoing\\" of Elena comes right when she cums at the hands (pun intended) of her true love and soulmate, Peyton. Elena is made love to...she's caressed, held, stroked, embraced and tasted when such passion. It unleashes her inhabitions and desire to do the same for Peyton. To love and be loved without reserve is the message here. I highly recommend this to anyone wants to enjoy a really great love story. It's a girl meets girl, loses girl, finds girl and their live happily everafter. 2 very strong thumbs up!a steels herself and says, \\"Peyton, make love to me.\\" That sentence had the intensity Category 5 & a 10.2.

Great and cheap way to get a large capacity pro duo card!

0545259088|4.0|This is the third and final book in 'The Wolves of Mercy Falls' trilogy.  This one upped the ante over both of the other two books making for a much more exciting read.<br /><br />It picks up with Grace as a wolf and Sam as a human.  Sam is living with most everyone in town believing him responsible for Grace's disappearance. Sam and Grace are very aware of their love and desire to be together though unsure how to accomplish this.  Cole continues the quest to find a cure while fighting his own personal demons.  And Isobel must learn to understand her feelings.  While these main characters struggle with these matters, something dangerous for all the wolves is looming.  A girl is killed and now the outrage from it has allowed Isobel's father to get his desire of a sanctioned all out effort to eradicate the pack.<br /><br />The plot moved along well.  The tension from the danger and unresolved issues and feelings of the protagonists made for exciting reading.  The characters are well drawn.  The world of the wolves is so realistic.  But the author's language is what makes it still hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />Only one thing got to me and it isn't bad, but I found the ending a little to open to interpretation.  Now my imagination ended it the way I wanted, but there was still that nagging feeling that 'what if that is not how the author would have ended it?<br /><br />I was sorry to leave the characters and world of Mercy Falls behind.  It is a beautiful, well crafted series.<br /><br />Recommend this book!
B002UP1SUE|5.0|I found some of his earlier books in my local library by accident.  The library only had about half of all his books (including only 2 or 3 Sigma books).  But I soon became addicted and HAD to read the rest!  I've enjoyed Doomsday Key although the regurgitation of the character development in each book (which helps them stand alone) does mean some speed reading is required in places.  Plot was excellent again.  As a fan of Matthew Reilly, James Rollins writing style is just as \\"edge of the seat\\" but I find Rollins has a much smoother writing style.  I've enjoyed all his books and can't wait to read Devils Colony!
0937381888|5.0|I've been a home brewer for about 2 years now with about 30 batches of beer under my belt. I found this book indispensible in my progression from my first 4 batches of extract beer to all grain, and this book is \\"the\\" book to get for most beginning brewers, especially the cerebral brewer. Lets face it, home brewing is not for everyone and it takes a certain amount of diligence (sanitation) and planning to make successful home brew. It doesn't take much to make decent home brew but you do need to pay attention to sanitation post boil to ensure your beer lasts longer than a month without getting sour.   To address MR, Palmer's* first edition of his book is available online for free but you'd be a fool to not pay the $12 to buy the 3rd edition. There is so much more information in this volume that is well worth the $12 bucks. That being said, if you're totally strapped for cash then his website is a great place to start.   To address Dan, brewing is a hobby that runs the gamut from the beginner extract brewer making pretty good beer in the one hundred dollar intro kit to the advanced brewer making beer in multi-thousand dollar brew sculptures with temperature controlled fermentors and kegorators. I fall somewhere in the middle with patched together equipment to make all grain batch sparged brews with a 4 tap kegorator (I used Palmer's book to build my mash tun). Trust me, when I made my first batch of extract beer I had Palmer's book opened and bookmarked with the process information (which he does a great job of outlining, down to how to rehydrate dried yeast). This book is written with the novice in mind (chapters 1 - 9) with chapter nine titled \\"Fermenting Your First Batch\\". The great thing about his book is it goes beyond your first few batches and gives you options to moving into partial mashing and all grain brewing, providing information on methods of mashing, how to lauter, troubleshooting your beer, lager brewing, mash pH, and an entire chapter of beer recipes. These recipes are good and if looking for a great book for beer recipes check out \\"Brewing Classic Styles: 80 Award Winning Recipes Anyone Can Brew\\" by Jamil Zainasheff and John Palmer which is an awesome book.  To summarize, brewing beer is not easy. It takes some effort, discipline, and time, but like cooking it can bring out your creative side to enable you to make awesome beer all your own without paying an arm and a leg for some of the craft beer that's out there. You can brew pretty good extract beers for anywhere from 0.50 - 1.00 dollars and moving to all grain can bring that cost down significantly. My most expensive beer brewed so far has been an imperial stout coming in at 10% ABV for around a dollar for a 12 oz bottle. Compare that to a $10 bomber (not saying my beer is as good as a $10 bomber) but you'd be surprised by what skilled home brewers can make (they've probably become skilled by reading John Palmer's book). If you are lazy or a slob, don't even try home brewing as you will find if frustrating and you will fail, but if you don't mind putting in some elbow grease then home brewing is for you. Buy How to Brew and get started!  *Palmer - This is what Jamil Zainasheff calls John Palmer on their Brewing Network Podcast, Brew Strong.   Oochi Brewer - BN Army!

This unit works very well but as noted in other reviews, it will not decode broadcast signals.  It will only work on my cable, dvd, and roku inputs.  Off-the-air produces nothing but static.
0385534639|3.0|Great prose. It is easy to understand. Visualization was well used, but unfortunately, it doesn't cut it as a plot.  Characters are incomplete. There isn't even a hint about them, thus they become detached and unable to relate oneself with them. The author or editor missed the entire point of literature.  Mostly characters seem plane as well as the supposed romantic interactions.  Again the plot is not rich, it is too too scattered all over the place. Sure we get introductions to many characters, but please, at least make the characters more interesting themselves other than the fact that they are from a mysterious circus.    If the author was panning to write a sequel this would e OK- not good or great for an introduction to the world of Night Circus, (spoiler maybe, don't read this sentence* skip to the next-) but it seems there wont be by the end of the book.  So it is very boldly finished. I understand the author is young and it is her 1st novel, but there have also been many great female authors with more prepared works than this.   If a circus is what you want to see and be mesmerized by it, just watch Cirque du Soleil. That being said I hope Summit entertainment knows what they are doing if they decide to make a movie.  For example, the book might not be that good but the movie might. I think, if directed correctly it can happen.  I believe that Alfonso Cuaron's adaptation of \\"A Little Princess\\" for example, is very well done.   Even though both the movie and book are different (neither is worse than the other they are just different) the movie turned out to be a classic. So hopefully A movie would add more drama and enrich the plot and interaction of characters and their personalities. But that is a hope for now.  Overall I am glad I read this book. I learnt a lot about visualization and plot development, however it is not a gift to my mind that I can open again and again.
0385535139|1.0|So many of John Grisham's works are wonderful and fun to read; but sadly, The Litigators is an exception. It has a good beginning, but proceeds to get worse and worse. Little suspense. So much so that after a while I did not even care what happened and it took effort to finish. Not recommended.

A sort of thriller-style 50 First Dates, it's not very deep, but a fun, page-turning read.<br /><br />A traumatic incident leaves Christine with a particular form of amnesia, which makes her unable to retain new memories for longer than about twenty-four hours. Every morning her husband, Ben, has to introduce himself to her and explain what's happened. On the suggestion of a new doctor, Christine starts keeping a journal. One morning she opens it to find a warning to herself: \\"Don't trust Ben.\\"<br /><br />Reading Christine's journal, trying to decipher the contradictory stories her husband tells her on different days, piecing these together with the fragments of memory that come back to her -- it's quite a fun mystery and there's the extra stress and urgency given that she has to start pretty much from scratch every morning.<br /><br />The suspense of Before I Go To Sleep is skillfully drawn-out. However, I never got totally absorbed by the story because the characters were a bit too shallow to care much about. Maybe this is an unfair complaint: it might be deliberate that we know little about Christine's personality, since, with her memory loss, she doesn't have much sense of her own life herself. In her journal, she wonders, \\"What are we, if not an accumulation of our memories?\\" But still, it's a bit disappointing when a book is filled with stock characters in stock relationships (though some are only revealed as the mystery unfolds).<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun, plot-driven read. It would probably make a good movie of the psychological thriller genre.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this originally for my daughter but we both got into it so much that we each had to have our own book to read at our own pace!<br /><br />What a huge thought-provoking series!  Amazing~ the discussions and questions about society, values and how one thinks makes this book worth it's weight in gold.<br /><br />Read them with your kid(s)~ you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />ps...Kids probably should be aged around 10 and up, depending on the maturity of the kid of course.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|An entertaining, if slightly improbable story, that centers on a young women's obsession with Jane Austen's book characters. This movie is best suited for those who have actually read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or seen one of the movies based on it. While the actors did a good job in their roles, the storyline was a bit far-fetched and hard to follow at times, even for an Austen enthusiast. A definite plus was the beautiful countryside where the movie was filmed.
B000VDDDY6|2.0|Step 1. Obtain a classic, if somewhat old, and well-loved series from yesteryear.<br /><br />Step 2. \\"Re-master\\" the series using modern effects.<br /><br />Step 3. Release said abomination to the public.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but my memories of Gene Roddenberry's classic have been brutally raped by this horrid, horrid abortion of money-hungry studios.<br /><br />The effects of the original show were always a little lame, but they went with the time period and they did not look out of place. The new effects are pathetic. Almost no money has been spent on them and they look cheap and nasty. What's worse, they stand out as modern effects amid the original 60's sets and therefore pull you right out of any immersion you have in every episode!<br /><br />The DVD's themselves are double-sided. In other words, cheap discs! The last time I saw a double-sided disc was Starship Troopers. Who in their right minds uses these anymore?<br /><br />I know Messrs Lucas and Spielberg have a history of \\"updating\\" their movies, but please don't ruin shows from my childhood as well!<br /><br />This lot is going straight on ebay and I'm now on a hunt to find a set of the original, un-butchered episodes somewhere.<br /><br />If you loved the original show, save yourself the pain and DO NOT buy this!<br /><br />EDIT: I've just learned that the 2009 blu-ray versions of the original series let you CHOOSE whether to watch the original, or \\"enhanced\\" effects. So it looks like I'll be getting those, then!
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is one of my favorite films; it was a surprising film to me when I first saw the genre of its kind in the theater. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Forrest and only one time do you see him break in character. Robin Wright (Jenny) displays a tragic rendition of a woman who has been molested and abused. Forrest and Jenny are the light and darkness of American society and represent children whom are really fatherless and without privilege. Gary Sinese does a wonderful job as Lt. Dan and represents hope and peace that can occur after one act of courage. And the tragedy of Bubba played by Mykelti Williams is unspoken.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought one of these while I was deployed, using my knife all the time can take its toll. This little guy got rid of the burrs and nicks and got it sharp again. It won't sharpen crap steel or BS knives (I tried) but if you got a good knife that needs some sharpening every now and again, this is the most portable and inexpensive way to get it done. I own a couple of these now and I take one with me backpacking and pretty much everywhere.
B0064BCNA4|4.0|Obviously not a full-fledged &quot;perfect&quot; serious piano, but as an entertaining all-ages toy and an aid for finding melodies by ear (for us music geeks), it's perfect amusement in between time. Best of all, it's a totally ad-free experience!
B0064BCNA4|4.0|after playing with all of the songs it makes me want to buy a keyboard, just to learn how to play! I hope the developers add more songs to extend the fun!
B003L77G8I|5.0|I received the show faster than expectd. When I watched it, it worked great. One part of the case on the inside was a bit messed up. The dvd slips out of place sometimes. But otherwise great.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Really enjoying this app.  I plan to buy full version.  Need more of this type of game but more puzzles and fewer hidden objects.
B0026OE2NY|5.0|This item arrived on time and it was just as described! Highly recommended and great to do business with! Thanks.
031261246X|3.0|I'm not much of a computer geek (no disrespect) so much of language concerning the virus details were foreign, but Russionvich did a good job of making it readable for all.<br /><br />I sure love a nice dystopia and love a good story with Islamo-Terrorism, however, this one did not take me to the destruction phase that I so long for!  Russinovich saved the day just before the world fell apart.<br /><br />This story brought to light just how much we rely on computers and how an effective attack could bring as much destruction as an EMP bomb.  When I look for the dark side of where our technology can take us I usually only search for the bombs and not the net, but this book will not let you forget just how deadly and scary a World without our computers can be; and how quickly.<br /><br />This easy read will fill you with enough action to keep you turning the pages, no matter how tech savvy you may be and keep you up at night after you ponder the possibilities no matter how predictible it may be.  I wouldn't say a bad read, but not too good either; another one to pass the day and to pick up at the library and keep your cash in your pocket.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|Overall good movie, I was hesitant about buying this movie because of the Universal ties to Ultraviolet. I bought it anyway, well I got it about a week ago with it sitting on my shelf pissed off because of the Ultraviolet thing, I decided to open it and watch, well to my surprise it also contained a digital copy code for iTunes I was overjoyed, This has renewed my faith in Universal. Karloff rocks
B004LWZW42|5.0|To show how it all came about was just great. Glad I purchased this movie. Everyone told me it was well done, and now I can agree. It was well conceived.

B0009XNUK0|5.0|Great compilation. It has it all for anyone. It is amazing how many great songs he has. I made my own greatest hits CD from these discs, it's amazing. The only song I thought they missed on was not including 'Working day & night', (which I added on my own). I was happy w/ the price also.

B0064BCNA4|2.0|After using this app I quickly became disappointed. the user interface is far too simple, especially to be charging money. The sound is terrible and delayed by a second after you press a key. I installed a free piano app a couple months ago that is extremely better. If it was free I wouldn't be writing, but since it's a paid app, not worth buying.

1847879071|5.0|Never has it been so obvious that an author did not want to write a text, which is what makes this book so rabbit awesome. The content is there, but it's presented in a way that actually holds the attention of the reader, and avoids dragging on topics.  Very enjoyable read, and THE book for SPSS!
B0064BCNA4|2.0|All piano  apps have 3D realistic looking keys, these are lame and flat. Pick a song and it just does one blue key, every piano app I installed is better than this one. Keep trying developer.
B005H0IW6W|2.0|I am very sad that average listener found this CD to be great. It tells how minimal our knowledge of jazz and good sound is.   Pros:  It has a very good selection of titles.  Cons:  Quality of sound - it is probably a good record if you own a boom box or you listen it in your car. If you own somewhat high level of equipment, skip it.  Quality of performer - i feel this record was done to make some money, as it is not something to be proud of musically or artistically.  Average record with average performance for a listener who doesn't understand a difference.
B005NF2UE6|4.0|It's classic Nickelback sound on their newest CD. I would recommend it for new and old fans because it will be enjoyed!
B000VNMMPM|5.0|The message in this film noir is revealed to the viewer near the end, and it's not at all what I expected. It's all about self-love and redemption. I bought this to send to a friend who is having some self-esteem issues and trying, unsuccessfully, to quit smoking. I loved everything about this movie. I'm a 59-year-old man, and it made me weep tears of joy for the main characters. Watch this movie, enjoy it, and learn from the lessons embedded therein.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Such a nicely written book. It is about a dry topic but, reads like a novel. Michael Lewis did a great job of taking a few people involved on short and long side of the trade and told the story from their perspective. If anyone wants to know how the subprime mortgage crisis came about, this is the book to read.
B004LA1ZYK|5.0|I have never had a pair of really nice boots... I wanted some for this coming winter, and I cannot be more pleased with them. I have always heard Timberland makes some of the best boots, and this seems true to me. I have only had them for several days now, and they are already extremely comfortable. I wear a size 14, and got the wide. They are perfect. They are nice and tight and do not slide around on my feet. There is also just the perfect amount of space that I can wear thicker socks if I want to. I am not sure about other people saying they run too large, because I always wear a size 14 and they are great. The leather is nice and thick and the stitching is done very well. I am extremely pleased, and am glad I have a nice pair of boots that are waterproof for the winter. They seem like they are going to last me a long time!
B000AOEMXM|4.0|There are longer and more detailed reviews here, so I'll keep this brief.  My wife and I caught Enterprise only intermittently when it aired (network and timing issues - you know, life.)  She remembered not liking it, I remembered that it seemed like one story line.  BUT...watching the whole thing from beginning to end, it really is a nice set of stories.  I have my own thoughts about how I wished they'd taken this prequel, but that's beside the point.  It was a little too \\"sexy\\" for my tastes to start with (maybe I'm just getting old =), but I understand TV and wanting to pull in a younger audience.  Anyway...we ended up liking the series and will undoubtedly pull it out again.
B000IJ79UW|4.0|1st I can't believe I purchased it at $30 and now it's only $5...and for that I deduct 1 star.   Now, if this is a gift for a Superman fan, they'll love seeing it with extra scenes and documentaries that maybe they've never seen before.
B005POK858|4.0|This was quite possibly the best game I've ever played on a phone. With a similar set up to Pokemon (which I played a lot as a child) I got super into it's basic gameplay style. However, it slowed down and froze my phone in addition to making my phone (LG Optimus V) randomly shut down and turn back on without notice....As soon as I uninstalled this app, my phone was fine. I tried to re-install, thinking maybe something went wrong in the download process, but that was not the case. It was so bad even when the game was not in use that I was forced to uninstall it permanently.
B0001MLMKY|2.0|The date feature on my swatch watch is all out of whack.  It never holds the right date.  Other than that it is a ok watch but for this price everything should work correctly and for product it is not the case.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|I grew up watching this film, always enjoying its attention to detail and how it slowly built tension through to the actual attack. I always thought that the special effects and live-action stunts were very impressive for the era, as well. So I was among the first in line to pick up a copy of this restored version on Blu-ray. Let me tell anyone sitting on the fence: buy it. The quality of the restoration is so good that it looks and sounds like the movie was filmed yesterday. Brilliant work!
B0058VW36U|1.0|I can't play the damn game never installs and i list my $ &gt; : l i install and it keeps saying app not installed must be a glitch with amazon or Samsung

B002BU0DPE|4.0|The sound from the PS3 Ear Force PX21 gaming Head set is top quality. The long cord is nice, it lets you play the game and is not restrictive. the controles work fine and are always in easy reach. I would recomend them to my freinds any time.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I was elated to see this available for my kindle fire. I use to have accuweather just on my desktop and now I can take it everywhere! :)
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Love this remake of the classic, though quite abit darker than original, it still has all the silliness and fun of the first, though I'd probably wait till my grandchildren are a little older before letting them watch this one, (some parts might seem scary to them). Anyway my family and I love to watch the older movie when we are in the mood to eat some candy. Enjoy!
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun, enjoyable, easily worth a dollar. usually good games from this studio, I'd recommend them in general and for this game specifically.
006135323X|5.0|If you want to know yourself better and if you care to know about human behavior I highly recommend this book. It talks about very common  trends (if not irrationalities) common in all of us, for which we rarely ask ourselves about.
B005K2XM94|4.0|I bought this before my Kindle Fire officially arrived so I would have something to put my new purchase into. I am very happy with the product for its sturdiness and it's ability to protect my Kindle from scratches. I do, however, wish I had a way to prop the Kindle up when using it to watch movies on an airplane. I know there are other cases out there that do that, but those got poor reviews about the way they were made. This is a solid case that does its job. If you desperately want something that props the Kindle up, then get another product. I really enjoy this one though!
140053271X|4.0|The Nook Simple Touch E-reader is a great tool. I use it often in all kinds of locations. Originally I was concerned when it did not connect to my wi-fi but I went on to B&N and did their download and it worked fine after that. It is exactly what is it says it is. The screen quality is amazing. Some of the transissions are not efficient, but overall it is a nice reader.
B004VDDV6C|5.0|I was given this book years ago by a friend who was shocked when I told him I had no idea what he was quoting! I found it so throughly entertaining that I now buy several copies a year to give to friends who say they have never read it!
B0057VDGNK|5.0|This album is a wonderful piece of music (just like the movie is!) although not everybody might be satisfied as most of tracks have roots in Ambient genre. Watch movie and if you like the in-score music then go for this OST.  Jacob
B00005KK4P|2.0|I never liked Böhm into Schubert symphonies because he doesn't feel this composer the way it should be with an Austrian spirit. It's deadly slow and heavy like some German music, especially in the \\"Unfinished\\" symphony, the most famous one.  For Schubert I advise Josef Krips or Karl Münchinger. Giulini made a nice reading of the \\"Unfinished\\" symphony on DG too.  Blomstedt is good also.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|**May contain minor spoilers**  An attempt is made to humanize the conspirators, namely Mrs. Surrat, but does so to little effect.  We see no real connection between her and her children, only a story of their drunken father and her attempts to make a living told within the cold stone walls of her prison cell.  Whether she was guilty or not, we may never truly know.  Many versions of her story abound, but in the end, history is written from the standpoint of the victors. We all know - or should know - that.  Evidence has even been presented suggesting Boothe survived long after Lincoln's assassination, evidence with historical backing, but like the evidence in Surrat's case, it has been buried once more.  This could easily turn into an argument of defending assassins, conspirators and such, but the greatest lesson to come from this movie remains.  That lesson is that from Mrs. Surrat's trial came the defense of one of our greatest rights:  The right to a trial by jury in peacetime OR war.  She may have been guilty, but the process of her trial was unfair and unconstitutional.   I don't \\"blame the government\\" as some one star reviewers suggest. I'm not anti-government. In fact, I am grateful that at long last, decent officials finally realized the injustice of Mrs. Surrat's trial and they agreed to stand for the rights of all by declaring trials like hers would not happen again.  This movie should be viewed as entertainment first, given historical inaccuracies (even the best historical movie has them), but secondly as a chance for us to delve deeper into history. Movies like this one should prompt us to think, to discuss and more importantly to LEARN not just the \\"victor's\\" point of view, but also the \\"loser's.\\"  All that said, please allow me to interject what I feel is a bit of humor.  At 1:07 in the movie, listen for the modern sounding toilet as Aiken waits to speak with Johnson.  It's just a wee bit out of place, don't you think?
B004VYYA2K|5.0|My daughter loved it.  It was actually larger than I thought it would be when we spread it out. Also great to store or carry barbies in.
B00664AM5C|5.0|I really liked this movie, and I would actually give it a 3.5 or 4 because I wasn't able to really connect with the characters the same way I would in a really good movie.  Why give it 5? Because I'm tired of people just coming to every movie with an UltraViolet Copy and giving it 1 stars without even hardly  acknowledging the film.  The digital copy doesn't even take away from the experience. The bluray and dvd are the same. If you don't want to use it then don't--but they don't necessarily owe you a digital copy with the bluray pack.
1416594787|1.0|It's a well written book but I think the arguments are unconvincing when compared with  those of the opposing side. I am not being biased, I tried to hear from both sides.  I have read Jonathan Safarti's \\"The greatest hoax on earth\\", which , to me, is more convincing.  For example, Dawkins said the poor design of the photocell in vertebrate eye is an evidence  of evolution, but that's due to his own misunderstanding.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have a soft spot for these headphones as I've had my current pair for nearly 11 years now. I've been through other 'audiophile' headphones but never parted with these and honestly will never NOT have a pair in my collection. My review is based on the Sony V6 model which is the same headphone except the MDR7506 has a gold plated plug.<br /><br />If you've read through other reviews I'm sure you've seen someone mention how these same headphones have been on the market going on 30+ years now utilizing their original design. Obviously a case of if it isn't broke ...<br /><br />Designed for studio/monitoring duties, they are a great pair of 'utility' headphones. They don't shine in any one area but they don't fail either. They are a flat neutral sounding headphone that will let you listen to music exactly as it was recorded. Neither the highs/mids/bass will be colored at all. Now this doesn't make for a necessarily engaging pair of headphones when listening to music but it's a true representation of the engineering/recording. That's not to say that they won't make music sound good but don't expect a fun/punchy sound like a Grado or a warm/recessed sound like a Sennheiser. They are 63ohm headphones so don't need much to get them loud. They sound just fine out of an iPod but will benefit from any headphone amp you have.<br /><br />One thing they definitely are better at than other headphones is their build quality. I have shown these headphones very little respect in terms of handling (i.e thrown into backpacks, stepped on, dropped onto the ground, slept in and rolled over on etc.) and they just will not break. I had a pair of [[ASIN:B000EBBJ6Y AKG K701]] which I treated like they were made of eggshells, these Sony's are the complete opposite. Abuse these headphones if you want, they won't mind. Remember, I've had the same pair for 11 years now.<br /><br />Now the one issue I do have with the headphones is the earpads. They have a pleather covering which will eventually start to flake away after oils from your hair/head break down the material.  This can easily be solved by replacing the earpads with either replacement Sony pads or you can get a velour replacement from Beyerdynamic. Just Google \\"Beyerdynamic DT250 Pads\\" and you'll find the proper links. Now I didn't start noticing the flaking issue until I had the headphones for 5-6 years. If you get a microfiber cloth and wipe down the headphones after use then you will keep the flaking issue from happening for a while. My recommendation is to look into the Beyerdynamic pad change long before that happens. They are more comfortable and make for a better seal to improve sound quality just slightly.<br /><br />So what do you get for less than $100? A time tested, professional quality 'industry standard' monitor that will last nearly a lifetime if just shown a little tiny bit of care.<br /><br />Highly recommended headphones for users of all types.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|This album is yet another amazing album from Michael Buble. His voice is just amazing; and in this album he works with Shania Twain, Thalia and Puppini Sisters. Is another album that needs to add on to the CD shelves. The minute I hear the album, I fell in love with it. Worth spending money on it. :D
B005TPCQ5I|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie because the book was great. I was so disappointed I had to force myself to get through the entire movie. The accents are so horrible, so fake. The only thing I liked was the scenery of the countryside. Otherwise, the book did a better job unfolding the wole story. You are better off buying/reading the book.
B0060FXBNM|1.0|THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT HOME VIDEO RELEASE EVER. History will view this as a turning point: Civilization before the Transformers box set was released and civilization after. At long last, two of the worst movies ever made are now bundled with a third, somewhat less awful movie! If you're anything like me, you've been chomping at the bit to relive the insanity, the incoherence, and most of all the indulgence that is the Transformers trilogy, and now you can whenever you want in the comfort of your own home! Who can forget John Turturro's terrible turn as whatever his awful character's name was? Or Ken Jeong turning in one of the worst performances anyone will ever see? Or the most blatant disregard for storytelling ever seen in blockbusters? Or the infinite amounts of awful humor that makes me never want to laugh again? Robot Heaven? The Twins? Important lore somehow inscribed on Shia's grandpa's glasses? Optimus Prime being caught in wires for 17 minutes of screen time? CLASSIC stuff!   All of your basic needs are now provided for, and it's all thanks to this great set! It's inevitable success doesn't prove ANYTHING terrible about humanity at all!

B00632HWOG|4.0|Ever since Yahoo acquired Oddpost in 2004, they've had the jump on all other free email providers, in my opinion. They've extended this expertise into the realm of the mobile mail app, and the Android version is an excellent example of this. Easy and smooth navigation from folder to folder, and intuitive message management are the highlights here. I do have a couple minor gripes that almost aren't worth mentioning: you can't pinch to zoom in or out, you have to use a little plus/minus button; when deleting a message you aren't taken to the next most recent message, which I think should at least be an option. Other than that, my hat is off to the Yahoo developers for yet another well designed app.
0439023521|5.0|I read this book about one month ago. It's absolutely amazing! I don't regret buying this book at all. Honestly it made me laugh and cry. During school when I would read it I'd laugh out loud and people must have thought that I was weird or something. It was a sad book but I didn't cry in public only in my room. The Hunger Games was the third boook I've ever read in my entire life and it made me love reading. Just but this book you won't regret (hopefully) but that's just me :)

B004W2UBYW|4.0|I appreciate what Steve accomplished. I am just glad I never had to work for him or spend any time with him. Down deep he was not a good person. The book pretty well details that part as he screwed person after person. I guess you need to be that way to accomplish what he did. The rest of up peons get to use the stuff but we did not have to endure Steve. Rest in Peace.

B005HXGE9G|5.0|The great man is 60 years old yet his blood is shiny new. I received my 2 disc edition copy in the mail a few weeks ago and have to say its condition was superb, despite the actual cardboard box it arrived in being slightly mistreated, but I live in South Africa and the dear box had much traveling to do, so this is understandable.    As for the music itself, there can be no denying it, it was superb. Clear, defined, crisp, deep and in most cases excruciatingly beautiful. I had heard all the songs, with the exception of the strange ambient noise of track 13, on Peter Gabriel's website, [...], so I knew what I was getting. However, when you first see the packaging, smell the inside of the CD case, the small booklet and just stare, almost blindly, at the presentation, it all comes to light. Something special is upon us. Peter has always believed in this sort of thing. Opening each new CD is like a small moment and something to absorb and savour. This was no different. The front cover has to be one of the most beautiful on any PG album, along with the cover for US and Scratch My Back, and it definitely makes sense in this regard. It seems Peter really enjoys black these days.    I will not make this review long so I'll note key points. Highlights on the album were the stunning \\"Downside Up\\", the instrumental \\"San Jacinto\\" (because it is a couple of seconds longer than the sung version, but that version is awesome too), the vibrant \\"Red Rain\\", the very eerie and scary \\"Intruder\\", and, arguably the best song on the album, the gorgeous \\"Wallflower\\". If there was one song on this album I didn't really catch onto well, it would have to be \\"Digging In The Dirt\\". This is because I really enjoyed the US version and the subsequent, increasingly violent live performances that followed in the ten or so years after. The live version of this song though, on New Blood Live In London, was much better. I've always preferred Digging In The Dirt's physical appearance on stage.    Overall, Peter has once again shown what kind of musical palette he has, as well as the skills and importantly, the trust he has in his arrangers and musicians, in this case many many of them. The result is something stunningly beautiful and surely unforgettable. The old classics, and unknown gems, given new blood, and boy, is it flowing like a wild river.    Mersi bokou Peter Gabriel. Mersi.
0385344325|4.0|I'm going to try not to give away any spoilers in this short review, but that's hard to do. So right off the bat, I liked this book. A bit slow to start, but it picks up, gives us a bit of the Reacher creation story, and is not deserving of some of the one star reviews. This book was not that different from the rest of the series, but was different enough to to show us something new. I could have done without the overly long sex scenes. Really.<br /><br />I think most people who have read author Lee Child's books about Jack 'none' Reacher, ex military police officer, would say he's nobodies fool. But in Child's latest book, I'm 80% through (80% as shown by my Kindle) and so far, Jack Reacher is looking like a bit of a fool. The latest  Reacher novel \\"The Affair\\" finds Jack back when he was in the armed forces, what appears to be his final mission. Find out who is killed a woman, slit her throat from ear to ear, and if its anyone from the nearby army base, save face for the forces.<br /><br />Child has alluded to similar events in the past by suggesting that previous events in Reacher's past are secret, some simply scrubbed from existence as if they had never happened, along with possible suspects, or those convicted. This might be one of those times.<br /><br />I read a few reviews before I started in on the book and I was surprised by the anger some of the negative reviewers let show. This book is slower then all of the others. It doesn't really get going until about 20 to 25 percent of the way through. The first few pages are a flash forward into the later part of the book, Jack is entering the Pentagon, he is unshaven and his hair is grown too long. He  believes that he's about to be arrested or shot, or both and in no particular order.<br /><br />After this the book slows down considerably, and to be sure, it seems like a lot of filler, but I don't really think it is. This is Jack Reacher's creation story. While Jack seems to be just flailing about there is some important work being done. We are being shown that Jack is a real person, that he doesn't just kill, maim and beat people to death. At about 30% through the book begins to pick up again.<br /><br />Still, though, we get the definite impression that Reacher is being taken for a ride.<br />Remember that I'm 80% through the book, so I don't yet know how it turns out, if Reacher is just playing the fool, or if he is being led by his, shall we say, ahem, nose? No. Lets say so far it seems he is being led by his belt. Not entirely the truth, but close enough for government work. Will Jack redeem himself in the readers eyes? Is he playing the fool? Are the readers being led down the garden path, only to find themselves in a gravel pit?<br /><br />It's pretty clear fairly soon in the book that the ex Marine MP and now small town elected Sheriff is not doing a very good job in finding the killer(s). Is she incompetent? Lazy? Or is the US Armed Forces putting up walls between her and the most likely suspect, a man who dated the dead woman? Is it because the town is small, the coroner is a doctor who does nothing but pronounce method of death? The author certainly leaves us to believe that Reacher is trying to figure out if the woman he has become intimate with is a killer.  Or is the killer the son of a senator, a Captain with the rangers, a man recently from Kosovo, where there are rumors of another woman's death? But would Reacher really become intimate with a killer?<br /><br />This is another great book in the Reacher series. I don't agree in the least with some of the very low reviews some are giving to it. But to each his own.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Child.

1590171993|5.0|This is a quiet, beautifully written novel about William Stoner, an English professor at the University of Missouri who, from an outside point of view, is something of a failure.  His wife, Edith, seems to hate him.  His daughter, Grace, undergoes many disappointments.  Having written one book, which receives only lukewarm praise, he is stifled in his attempts to write more by his wife.<br /><br />But the novel itself is extraordinary in its ability to show the texture of an ordinary life and to suggest how surviving stoically, as Stoner is reduced to in last part of his life, can in some ways be a triumph.  Part of the novel deals with the inability to verbalize feelings.  Stoner is a farm boy and falls in love with literature when he takes an English class at the university, where he's come to study agriculture. That early, stony upbringing leaves him usually unable to express his feelings about literature (and often about people), but at times he is able to.  These two registers of feeling run through the novel - what can be expressed and what can't.  There is a section of great erotic power in the middle of the novel dealing with his affair with one of his students. Here, he is able to express his feelings and his thoughts with complete freedom, but when his enemy on the faculty makes sure the affair will end, he is thrown back on his stoic upbringing.<br /><br />Stoicism is not shown as a solution, though, as it doesn't help his daughter, who is unable to draw upon the same stony resources Stoner himself has found from his farm upbringing.  Still, compared to the alternatives of paranoia, self-pity or withdrawal, his stoic response to his situation later in his life is probably the best he could put together.<br /><br />The writing itself is luminous.  There are passages describing the hall where the English department is located that really evoke the midwestern university.  I got my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and although Stoner went to school generations before me, our classes were in buildings of the same era, and Williams really fully captures that ambience.  One of the best books I've read in quite a while.re me, our classes were in buildings of the same era, and Williams really fully captures that ambience.

I would say my least favorite is the Terminal Man and this is hands down my favorite.  When I finished this book, I literally had a different perception of my surroundings for a few days (will not say why or it will ruin the story).  It has suspense, it has several twist, and you won't want to put it down.  Enjoy and be prepared to sleep with the lights on!

The BAD: The keys that you need to play are changed to blue, but there is no indication what the next note is, or how fast the melody should be, so you're in limbo [especially when the same key is hit more than once]. Also the other sounds available [other than piano] have poor tonal structure. There is no shading or other structuring of the keys as in the first photo.   Worth being free, not $.99.

0060558121|1.0|I must have missed something while reading this book, which I found both gory and nonsensical. There was no connectivity or cohesiveness with the characterizations. Unlike most people, I don't have a &#34;genre&#34; of any particular type of book I like to read. I enjoy reading EVERYTHING; fiction, non-fiction, poetry; anything well-written. However, this book bored me from the git-go. I kept waiting for a real plot to develop and for some in depth development of characterizations. Just didn't happen for me. I found it to be pointless; just one long attempt at &#34;shock and awe.&#34; Neither the characters, nor the plot (if any), ever truly developed. It was full of graphic descriptions of death and gore, which I can handle if they are taking me somewhere, which I feel like this book failed to do. &#34;American Gods&#34;, supposedly, enveloped some sort of spiritual awakening, which, quite frankly, I just didn't get, in spite of my own highly-developed imagination! The book ends at Rock City, a popular tourist attraction near Chattanooga TN, which is about 20 miles from where I live. By the time I got to the end, I felt cheated and was thinking to myself; just about anyone with a wild imagination could have written this book. It is disappointing to me that so many people think this is a &#34;good&#34; book.

0446547654|2.0|After a fairly interesting start, this book went rapidly downhill particularly in the final chapters--I could see the end coming a mile away.  Without giving anything away, the ending was contrived and totally implausible and I truly disliked how the book concluded, down to the epilogue.  After going through pages of the psychology of the characters and their lives, flashbacks, and the story of their friend Tucker who recently passed on, Sparks goes and spoils it all with a Deus ex Machina ending that \\"resolves\\" (or so he thinks) it all. I got annoyed by the Amanda character and found her a bit of a twit and the villains with super powers (one even being able to trash a place after suffering serious injuries). I found Amanda and her husband's relationship totally unbelievable and her husband seemed a bit of a stock character.  As I read through the last pages I thought what a waste. I hope Sparks does better next time.
1400049628|4.0|Max Brooks's Zombie Survival Guide is not only informative but also well written. There are a few issues that I disagree with him on. Most of those are due to interpretation, and therefore nobody would have the \\"correct\\" answers until a true outbreak occurs, but there are some traps that he falls into that many other quasi-fantasy authors do as well. The main one is excessive Japanophilia. The area this shows the most is in his \\"weapons and combat techniques\\" chapter.   The first is in his dismissal of an axe as impractical. I actually agree with him on this, as it would be very hard for an untrained person to decapitate a zombie with one, but then he introduces another weapon as a superior alternative, the Shaolin spade (yes, I know, it's Chinese, so I guess I should have said Asiaophilia or something). I literally gawked for a few seconds when I first saw that heading due to the sheer stupidity of the idea. It's an obscure weapon, Google it if you aren't familiar, and I know from first-hand experience that they are quite clumsy to wield. He states that \\"thrusting forward with either blade will produce instant decapitation.\\" No, no it would not. First of all, it is HARD to decapitate a human, even if the flesh is starting to rot off their neck. In medieval executions, it could take up to three swings with a two-handed executioner's axe to lop a head off (admittedly, for experienced executioners it usually only took one), and that's with their neck resting upon an execution block. In the free air, the neck will move with the swing, cutting its force by at least half (lower acceleration as it takes longer for the blade to come to a halt). That means, that even with a DEDICATED decapitation weapon, it would be quite hard to decapitate a zombie. Now think about thrusting. It would be simply impossible for a human to generate enough thrusting force to get even a third of the power they could with a swing. Ever try chopping wood by holding an axe by the shaft right behind the head and pushing it at the log? It doesn't work. So, that rules out his assertion that it would be easy to decapitate a zombie by thrusting with a Shaolin spade. Then, if you think of how swinging the spade would work, it only has a small sharpened edge on the front of the main blade, running perpendicular to the direction of a swing. This means that only one or two inches of sharpened blade would be showing on the cutting plane, which is why one can see that they were primarily used as a bludgeoning weapon. All in all, a Shaolin spade would be next to useless against zombies.  The second is his love of Katanas. Don't get me wrong, I like Katanas too. Historically, not only were they better crafted than European swords, they were better in next to all situations than European swords, as both were nearly useless against heavily armored foes and Katanas were superior against lightly- or un-armored foes. However, this was because they were very, very good at creating flesh wounds. With their light, curved blade they are easy to handle and cut through flesh easily. The same does not go for bone. Due to their light weight, it would be extremely hard for one to carry enough momentum to sever a human spine, which is far tougher that one would think. Thus, the Katana is nigh useless against zombies. This is one of the only places that a heavy European sword would outshine a Katana. They still wouldn't be extremely effective, but as all combat ready swords are made with similar tempered steel nowadays, the only difference would be the curvature and weight. The curvature would not make too much of a difference, but a heavier blade would decapitate much more easily, although it would still be quite difficult to do so. Therefore, better than either of these would be a machete, preferably as heavy a one as you could get. They are designed to cut through dense foliage, and therefore are more weighty and carry an edge with a less acute angle, meaning they don't have to be sharpened religiously after every use. So don't go on the net looking for a battle-ready Katana or Claymore for $600+, just go to your local hardware store and buy the heaviest, highest quality machete you can get your hands on. Not only will it be 5% the price, it will be more effective. I would recommend the two-handed Panga or Latin machetes from Cold Steel, at $25 from Amazon with available prime/super-savers shipping. The top reviewer on the two-handed Panga machete even lauds its merit as a potential zombie-fighting weapon.  Now, past the love of far-east weapons, there are another couple other misguided suggestions he makes. The first is to own a silencer, as it will allow you to dispatch zombies without attracting more of them. This is based on \\"movie silencers\\" (and video game ones as well) that quiet guns down to a whisper. This is extremely inaccurate. In real life, they are more often referred to a \\"suppressors,\\" and for good reason. They only quiet the shot down a little bit, sometimes enough so that you can shoot without using ear protection. It will still make a loud report, especially if it's an automatic or semi-automatic weapon, and that's before you consider ammunition. Most of a gun's noise is the sonic boom generated by the bullet. Unless you have a massive stash of sub-sonic ammunition, this will be unavoidable in the event of a zombie outbreak. Thus, while suppressors might make shooting a little easier on your ears, it would be cheaper and less of a hassle to just use some ear plugs. (note: there are some pretty quiet silenced weapons. These are either weapons chambered in .22 LR or integrally suppressed weapons, such as the MP5SD, AMP DSR-1 [still loud, uses very large bullets, but much quieter than comparable snipers], and a variety of limited-run assault rifles. However, integrally suppressed weapons are very expensive and very hard to acquire)  The final inaccuracy that is large enough to address is his hate for the M16. Now, I have never been a fan of the M-16 or the related AR-15, M4 and AR-10 (I am more of an FAL guy). They do have certain design flaws, especially in the M-16 and some AR-15 variations, need more regular maintenance than competitors and jam a little more often, but most of these have been addressed in the civilian market and in the military versions for decades. It might not be as nice as an AK-47 for a survival situation, but it's more accurate, easier to shoot and usually around 4 lbs. lighter. Thus, his statement that this weapon family is considered \\"second-class\\" can only be attributed to an irrational anti-establishment view. Given my ideal rifle, it would be chambered in 5.56 (plenty to destroy a zombie's brain, the extra kick from a 7.62x39 from an AK would just be detrimental) and be semi-auto capable. As he says, full-auto is just a waste of ammo against zombies, so it's not necessary. My personal ideal would be a IMI TAR-21, as its bullpup configuration makes it about 10 inches shorter than normal rifles with the same barrel length, and a little lighter too. However, any of modern M4 or an M416 would function very well, and would have plenty of spare parts to be found.  Other than these four issues, I found the book an informative and helpful read, with plenty of common sense and every once in a while some legitimate insight.  Side note: He neglects to mention red dot and holographic scopes. These are the best friends of new shooters, and will allow a newbie to shoot two times (disclaimer: results may vary) better than with iron sights. They originated in competition shooting and then special forces started snatching them up like hotcakes when they got reliable, so you would be in good company if you had one. Many have 600 hr battery lives and can use AA's, and the Trijicon RMR with the tritium lamp lasts up to 15 years. So, basically, just keep a little baggie full of batteries and you'll be good, and your life will be much easier if you come across a group of zombies.edit: I forgot that he called light machine-guns heavy machine-guns. That's just a minor, and common, error though.

0385338910|5.0|I love it when I find a book by an author I'm unfamiliar with and within the first couple of chapters, I know I want to read everything that author has written. This is the story of a 29-year-old man whose 40-something wife died in a plane crash and left him in outer suburbia well before his time. To add to his woes as he attempts to come to terms with his new normal, he finds himself responsible for his wife's rebellious always-in-trouble 16-year-old son.<br /><br />Sound morbid? It's not. Tropper is ingenious at alternating between scenes that are hilarious and scenes that are poignant and empathy-generating. He ingentiously captures the goings-on of a semi-blended, semi-not-so-blended dysfunctonal family whose repartee is so clever I'm glad they make such a mess of getting along. He has keen insight into human behavior, particularly in terms of how people experience grief and how that grief sometimes ensnares them. And Tropper is a master of run-on sentences, not the kind that you have to reread to make sense of them, but rather the kind that get better and better the longer they get, and that I ended up rereading just because they were such fun to read in the first place. Some parts of the plot seemed a little forced to ensure the right people were in the right place at the right time to move the story along, but I didn't care because I so enjoyed the writing that I would have followed the story wherever it went.<br /><br />I'm so glad Tropper has written other books. I can't wait to read them.

I don't love books written in the first person but it really suits this series, especially in this book where you're not really sure what's going on, and you really are only privy to what the main character knows.<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend this series. The books are teen appropriate (they are not overly graphic) but appeal to adults as well. You can't really read just one of the 3 books... it's all or nothing! I can't wait to get my hands on the final book!
0307959856|3.0|This isn't a bad book. It's just slow-moving and bland. The characters of Darcy and Elizabeth are particularly colourless. It's surprising to find Elizabeth a supporting character in her own life.  She barely appears in the second half of the book.  Darcy seems unsure and somewhat lost, far from the commanding presence in Pride and Prejudice. Even the formality between the Darcy's seems odd; surely at least in private they'd call each other Lizzy and Will. The mystery isn't very mysterious either;  I had a pretty good idea what was going on early on. But as someone else pointed out it's a good 19th century procedural.  Oh, well,  I was just hoping for more.

0307593312|5.0|This book talks about the life of some persons. The events are related to strange situations, the facts are similar to the thriller or to the fantasy, but it is strong also the descriptions of love. What is diferent respect to other books of this author, it is a better capacity to spoke about himself, and the sense of drama become less important, leaving the place to the surreal histories.The result is a mix of several types of writing which represents a true pleasure for which read it.
0307959856|2.0|I admire P. D. James for her attempt at this stage in her life to create a Jane Austen murder mystery, instead of just resting, as well she might, on her Adam Dalgleish laurels, but, alas, I found this book a grave disappointment. While the characters of Darcy, Bingley and all of the Bennets are all curiously undeveloped, that of the previously sanguine Colonel Fitzwilliam has been changed out of all recognition. And I must confess that I myself did not appreciate having the shades of Pemberley again polluted by Pride and Prejudice's unsavory underbelly. Also there are errors here that should have been caught by a good editor, or, better yet, never introduced by the author herself. One minor example consists in the passing references to Austen's final novel, Persuasion: since James's tale of melodrama and mayhem takes place in 1803-04, the removal of the Elliot family to Bath--let alone their presumed eventual return to Kellynch--and the marriage of Anne Elliot to Captain Wentworth--let alone his promotion to admiral--were then still very much future events.
0553386794|5.0|Love this book and am eye ball deep into the series. I usually find most fantasy series way to complex with way to may characters and way to much going on and get lost in the first chapter so I stop reading (Robert Jordan series).  This author does a wonderful job creating a world that is interesting,with great characters, fun and a wild ride.  Breaking up each chapter to each character makes it very easy to keep track of the multiple plots. I love the way the author has set the characters like pieces on a chess board.  Lots of great twists and last min saves that have kept me happily reading on.

There are a group of trolls out there that ar attacking this book and I promise this book will not disappoint!<br /><br />While Travis's character is a bit intense, the reader needs to look beyond this and focus on the obstacles the characters overcome. The reader also needs to sympathized with Travis's upbringing. Having lost his mom at a young age surely impacted his life in a huge way. He loves fiercely and the book takes many twists and turns not letting you put it down for a second! Can not wait to read Travis's point of view!
B004VMUS9G|2.0|The Alarm Clock Xtreme Free app needs some work. The volume is not loud enough, even when my KF is at maximum.<br /><br />It may eat the battery, but most active apps actually do this. I never use pda alarms without an AC adaptor.<br /><br />Better still, KF should have alarm clock as a built-in function: how many times have I missed an appointment or event because I had my nose stuck in a book? Having an alarm available seems (to me at least) to be part of the book-reading experience.

0307388921|3.0|Chuck Palahniuk crafts another absurdist tale about characters on misadventures against normalcy.  His goal: to rock you, to unsettle your cozy vision of society.  What's Palahniuk trying to say as he throws Victor into restaurants with the intent to dupe good samaritans into believing they have saved him from choking?    Victor is choking, really.    Stuck in the pattern of addictions he wishes to eject out of himself once and for all.  Choking on the memories of his dysfunctional upbringing, all interspersed in flashback throughout the narrative, lodged in between the chapters like undigested food, chunks of thought his whole being revolts against.    The movie directed by Clark Gregg adheres closely enough to this book for you to get a sense of it.  And while I enjoyed banging into the pages, I reserve five stars for the books I will revisit, the books that I want a long term relationship with.
B004GYNPL2|1.0|... moving data to the KF from iPhone is a pain in the butt, and, um, mSecure isn't secure in transfers using csv-formatted files.<br /><br />Why in the world would people write a good/great app, and do a lousy port? And make database transfer difficult? It makes ZERO sense to me.<br /><br />KF is partly to blame - the \\"look ma! no cable needed!\\" approach is a gross deficiency if you NEED data to move from a PC (or even a Mac, if you have that kind of chemical imbalance) and have to send it via the \\"personal docs\\" email path.<br /><br />mSecure and Amazon/KF need to get on these issues, pronto. I'm g**-d****d if I'm going to have unsynchronized databases, and have to hand-enter duplications.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|I usually build cheaper computers and go AMD, but i went with this processor after doing a lot of research.  This processor is amazing when it comes to gaming and converting videos. The benchmarks are great too.  Do not go with stock cooler.  I bought one off of Amazon and it is really tall but it never goes above 32 degrees Celsius.  Hard to put this processor under a full load as it can handle a lot.  Also easily overclocked in my motherboard.  It was clocked at 4.3 ghz and ran fine.  I prefer to get a full life out of it so I just keep it at stock which... is simply amazing regardless.  I find it hard to believe anyone would need to go above stock speed.  BUT it is overclock-able so have fun with it.
0395389496|4.0|The other three kids on the train were important supporting characters in the movie, but they must have been three of the \\"other children\\" promoted from the status of \\"extra\\" to \\"co-star\\". By Van Allsberg? I don't know, especially as he's billed here as the illustrator more than as author, and I don't know if he was in on the making of the movie. So if you saw the movie first as I did, you might be disappointed.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|When this film first hit theatrical release back in '04, all the ads hyped all the special effects, the theme-park roller coaster aspects of the train's journey north. This stoner I roomed with at the time enthused: \\"Dude, that flick must be awesome to watch when you're high.\\" Not exactly the sort of testimonial that impresses me--I detest the videogame-looking garbage he calls \\"a good movie\\". I've been to an IMAX house just once and wrote that particular cinematography genre off as \\"no story or plot, so they beat you up with special effects\\" fare. No entertainment value so you get cheap thrills. So I said no thanks.<br /><br />About four years ago I broke down and rented the thing. So now I watch it every year. It goes to show how a bunch of doofuses who put everything into only two categories--\\"Awesome\\" or \\"that s**cks\\"--have really trashed the entertainment landscape. Another customer here observes \\"charitably\\" that it's a good movie despite it's being a bit short on plot. And in a way, that's true. If they took a lot of the action stuff out, they could show this as an \\"Afterschool Special\\". Because mainly it's about four kids, three of whom for one reason or another are \\"outgrowing\\" Santa Claus. One is our storyteller, who the end credits call \\"hero boy\\". He's the one who's in all the action sequences--recovery of a ticket that blew away, helping to regain control of a runaway locomotive, you name it. Another is a cynical, sharp-voiced kid who knows all the answers and bombards you with them. You just know that he's one of those kids who calls all other kids by putdown nicknames. A third is a poor kid who lives in a ramshackle house and no doubt has a very sparse Christmas tree in terms of what Santa puts under it. But the real star is a young black girl who the end credits call \\"hero girl\\". One lady I used to date was the type who could brighten up a room just by walking in. She was always the first one to make some sort of gesture of kindness to someone who was bummed out about something or felt out of their depth. And whenever something good happened to you, she was at least as happy about it as you were, if not more so. To this day I believe she was the proverbial \\"Miss Right\\", but it never worked out for us. I used to speculate what she must have been like as a kid. And \\"hero girl\\" strikes me as my theories about my \\"old flame's\\" childhood personified.<br /><br />It's quickly obvious why the three boys are on this train trip, but we have to gradually find out why \\"hero girl\\" is there. After all, she's about as \\"together\\" a person as you can get. So we learn it's because she's needed as de facto peer leader. When the poor kid gets on the train, his inferiority complex makes him not join the others, so \\"hero girl\\" is the first to spot that and heads for him. At one point he begins a musical \\"soliloquy\\" how Christmas always has left him out and \\"hero girl\\" promptly joins him for her side of the issue. Their duet is the song \\"When Christmas Comes To Town\\"--\\"shy boy\\" in a wistful but resigned tone, \\"hero girl\\" with her heartfelt reply about the joy that Christmas means to her. The other day I downloaded that song and played it on my MP3 player. I've still got it stashed in a Christmas music folder. I'm reading all sorts of comments here which add up to \\"geez, they oughta have some pro do a cover of it\\". When I did a search for it here, there were a couple of other versions.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game (1985) is a brilliant novel that achieved legendary status when it was released in the 80s, and is still widely read and praised today. The book won both the Nebula award for best novel in 1985 and the Hugo award for best novel in 1986 - which are largely considered to be the two most prestigious awards in science fiction - while the sequel to Ender's Game also won the same awards, making the author the first to ever receive both awards in consecutive years. The mastermind behind Ender's Game - Orson Scott Card - dropped this literary bomb simply so he could establish the main character Ender Wiggin and pave the way for the book he actually wanted to write: 'Speaker for the Dead' - the sequel to Ender's Game. I haven't read it yet, but I already have a copy and I'm ready to eat it up. Now before I jump into my review of this fine piece of fiction, I want to warmly encourage you to read this book, actually scratch that, I want to challenge you to get up to chapter 7 - Salamander, and not be completely hooked. Yeah, that's right.  Onto the review: In a nut shell, Ender's Game is about a very gifted young boy called Ender Wiggin, who is sent into outer space to train in a military Battle School as preparation for a possible alien invasion on Earth. Most of the action takes place inside the Battle Room, which is a zero gravity arena located inside the school, where other gifted kids like Ender play war games with each other. The kids belong to one of several armies and must learn how to work effectively within squads to complete objectives, while the brighter kids are made commanders and have to manage and coordinate a small army of soldiers. It may sound like a typical cheesy science fiction plot, and in a way it is, but Orson Scott Card manages to breathe life into every page, and builds likeable characters and unique situations that make it impossible to put the book down. Ender's Game is also required reading for those in the US Military, and this is not surprising as it creates a believable military world where leadership and strategy are keys to success, and also contains allegories which rationalise the military's 'end justifies the means' mentality.  Orscon Scott Card begins the novel with an inspiring introduction that captures in a few sentences, 'the essence of the transaction between storyteller and audience' and also the spirit of what makes Ender's Game such a great book. He writes:  'Why else do we read fiction, anyway? Not to be impressed by somebody's dazzling language - or at least I hope that's not our reason. I think that most of us, anyway, read these stories that we know are not \\"true\\" because we're hungry for another kind of truth: The mythic truth about human nature in general, the particular truth about those life communities that define our own identity, and the most specific truth of all: our own self-story. Fiction, because it is not about somebody who actually lived in the real world, always has the possibility of being about ourself. The story of Ender's Game is not this book, though it has that title emblazoned on it. The story is one that you and I will construct together in your memory. If the story means anything to you at all, then when you remember it afterward, think of it, not as something I created, but rather as something that we made together' - Orson Scott Card  These words resonate throughout the entire reading of Ender's Game, as Card uses very little descriptive writing and instead encourages the reader to use their own imagination to create characters and construct settings, such as the Battle Room and the firefights that take place within it's walls. The reader is injected into the pages of the book and will see events transpire through Ender's eyes, and listen to conversations through his ears, you will develop empathy for this character's story, and his story will become your own; It is a long and worthwhile journey which will leave you completely satisfied by it's conclusion. Orson Scott Card has also written two great books on writing (Characters & Viewpoint, and How to Write Science Fiction & Fantasy) which are invaluable to aspiring authors, but Ender's Game is perhaps the greatest teacher of all; contained within it's pages are flowing rivers of literary wisdom, and floating through it it will help you understand how to write dialogue (dialogue begins the start of every chapter), how to pace a story, how to create believable characters and finally how to write a crashing climax! I can't rate this book highly enough, read it!
B000K7MMPE|5.0|This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is the 1980 BBC miniseries,adapted by British novelist Fay Weldon and is a very faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. It consists of five episodes and stars the engaging Elizabeth Garvie as Ms Elizabeth Bennet and the aristocratic-looking and handsome David Rintoul as Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.<br /><br />This was the first adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I watched, almost 16 years ago back when I was in college, and till today it remains one of my favorite adaptations of Austen's works, right up there with the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. In fact, both Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul do a very credible job portraying the lead roles.<br /><br />Although Jennifer Ehle was charming and feisty in her role in the 1995 version, Elizabeth Garvie makes a spirited Elizabeth and a very attractive, bright woman. She delivers her lines with great spirit and I was utterly charmed by her performance. Her chemistry with Mr. Darcy was also very believable, from the early days of misunderstanding and tension to the gradual growing of affection between them. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as popular as Colin Firth's but he definitely brings a certain dignity and charm of his own to the role.<br /><br />As for the adaptation of the novel itself, the 1980 version is more faithful than the 1995 version, as it also contains about 75 extra minutes of dialogue that adds to the authentic feel of the adaptation. The rest of the casting in the 1980 adaptation was also well-done - Priscilla Morgan is hilarious as Mrs Bennet,Moray Watson is wonderful as the beleaguered Mr Bennet,Sabina Franklyn as the very beautiful and very nice Jane Bennet, Marsha Fitzalan made a very conniving Caroline Bingley and Judy Parfitt is perfect as the haughty and meddlesome Lady Catherine de Bourgh. However, I must admit that I preferred the 1995 casting with respect to the roles of Mr Collins [suitably oily], Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.<br /><br />In Episode 2, Mr. Collins reveals his intentions during his visit, i.e. that he wishes to take one of the Bennet girls for a wife. Initially he targets the eldest Miss Bennet (Jane), but when Mrs. Bennet makes it clear that she is already 'taken', he shifts his attentions to poor Eliza Bennet, who clearly detests the presumptuous, overbearing man. There is so much comedy here to entertain, especially during the hilarious proposal scene, where Elizabeth tries her best to hide her revulsion and maintain her composure. The part where Mrs. Bennet insists on Mr. Bennet talking some sense into Elizabeth (into accepting Mr. Collins' proposal) and his reaction is worth a good laugh.<br /><br />What lets down this older adaptation though is the poor production quality - the lighting is too dull and scenes of dancing at the balls are very uninspired with cheap looking, very small sets that don't enhance the dramatization. It's a pity for with better production values, this could have been a stellar production given that it had a great screenplay and wonderful acting.<br /><br />On the whole, I find it hard to fault this adaptation. It will always remain one of my favorite adaptations, not just of Pride and Prejudice, but of Austen's works as it is very faithful and well-cast. I recommend this to all Austen fans and also those who have only watched the 1995 adaptation and the 2005 movie version starring Keira Knightley.Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.

B0002KVULG|5.0|Though not exactly faithful to the original novel this is still one of the better Dracula movies of the last forty years.  Despite the absence of modern digital effects they manage realistic and believable looking wolf and bat transformations.  And there are twinges of sympathy to the otherwise vicious yet charismatic portrayal of Dracula by the highly under-rated Frank Langella.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this film to any fan of Dracula.  It's a little jarring to a book fan to know the characters of Mina and Lucy had their names swapped and that Mina (portrayed more as the Lucy character of the novel) in this version of Professor Van Helsing's daughter.  But Lucy (Mina of the novel) is a great character.  This is probably the best developed version of the character I have seen, despite the name swap.  She's independent, out spoken and a suffragette.  She invites Dracula to dance with her right in front of her own fiance and you can tell that it's Dracula who is seduced by her boldness and unconventional way of thinking.  She is no impassive Victorian.  And you can honestly see why Dracula finds her attractive.  There is actually chemistry between them.  But don't let the love story turn you off.  He's still a vicious predator who rips out throats, kills the crew of a ship, and makes veiled threats.  He's still the bone chilling hunter, Dracula.<br /><br />I like the balance of charm and viciousness.  It makes the darker moments all the more disturbing when you counter-balance it with charm.  Modern vampire films have forgotten this.  They either make the main vampire too sympathetic or a mindless fiend who just wants to kill.  This is a healthy balance of seduction and sadism.  Monster and man. This is the traditional vampire the world has missed in recent entertainment.<br /><br />By the end of the movie I was hoping Dracula would win and part of me is convinced that he actually survived and like in the Fred Saberhagen Dracula books will return for his beloved later when no one is expecting it.<br /><br />Some of the effects are spooky and disturbing and there are hints of humor with Renfield's incompetence and Dr. Seward's food and laudanum fixation.<br /><br />The one thing I dislike about this DVD is that when it first went to theatres in 1979 and went to VHS tape in the early eighties it had vibrant color.  When it was time to release the film to disc the director felt it would look better in washed out, de-saturated nearly black and white coloring and had most of the film's color removed (except during an intimate scene between Dracula and Lucy).  The washed out colors hurt the film.  The images are now grainy and faded looking.  It was never meant to be seen this way. It hurts the cinematography. I wish they would one day release a two disc version with one version of the movie with the original colors restored and another with the washed out nearly black and white version, that way both the fans and the director can be satisfied.d later when no one is expecting it.<br /><br />Some of the effects are spooky and disturbing and there are hints of humor with Renfield's incompetence and Dr. Seward's food and laudanum fixation.<br /><br />The one thing I dislike about this DVD is that when it first went to theatres in 1979 and went to VHS tape in the early eighties it had vibrant color.

0156711427|3.0|I kept waiting for this novel to begin. Forster sets the scene, develops the characters, creates tension (not dramatic tension; just tension), and then...<br />And then the characters realize that the tension isn't going to be easily resolved and decide that the best course of action is to abandon the effort and drift aimlessly for the last 100 pages or so towards an unsatisfying d&eacute;nouement. I was almost finished with \\"A Passage to India\\" when it dawned on me that the novel's climax was long past and I'd somehow missed it. I still was waiting for the story to begin. I eventually resigned myself to the fact that Forster's intent in \\"A Passage to India\\" is to describe a situation rather than tell a story. Yes, there is a plot of sorts, but Forster's real aim is to depict two cultures at an impasse at a particular point in history: 1) indigenous Indians chafing under British occupation in the early 20th century, yearning for independence but unable to envision a unified nation of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs; and 2) British colonists determined to maintain the status quo, and genuinely convinced that their presence in India is necessary because the natives are incapable of ruling themselves. Forster's refusal to provide the reader with a sense of resolution serves a symbolic purpose, emphasizing the impossibility of bridging the cultural divide so long as the relationship between the British and the Indians remains one of ruler-and-ruled. The novel's unconventional structure (the climactic moment takes place relatively early on; the novel's chief dramatic complication is never worked out; loose ends are not tied up) also serves a purpose, underscoring Forster's view that there are no easy answers to the complex racial and cultural issues examined in the novel. However, though these elements may be useful from a symbolic perspective, they make for frustrating reading.<br /><br />The novel's action takes place in the fictional Indian city of Chandrapore, which is under British colonial rule. There is a great deal of latent hostility floating around Chandrapore. The native Indians resent the presence of the Anglo-Indians and engage in subtle acts of rebellion against them while maintaining a surface-level politeness. There is friction between Indian Muslims and Indian Hindus, who do not understand each other. The British colonists, most of whom regard the native inhabitants as inferior beings, are deeply suspicious of the few Brits who treat the Indians with respect. Finally, there is painful awkwardness in each and every attempt at social interaction between the friendly Anglo-Indians and the natives. Courteous gestures are misinterpreted and come across as insulting or gauche. Conversation is strained, rife with blunders and cultural misunderstandings. The tension is palpable. Reading about these social failures becomes agonizing after a while and the reader begins praying for a reprieve, hoping for just one successful picnic or party or even a few moments of stress-free small talk. But the prayers go unheard. Forster is unrelenting, and there is no relief. One-third of the way through the novel, I began developing a nervous tic.<br /><br />Often in my book reviews, I complain that the author didn't spend enough time on character development. Forster certainly cannot be accused of this, particularly when it comes to his Indian characters. If anything, these characters have too many layers, too many contradictory qualities; they are too multi-dimensional to be quite believable. I got the impression that Forster was trying to embody the characteristics of an entire country in a handful of characters, to convey all of the nuances, complexity, and contradictions of India herself through them. It doesn't quite work. For example, the character of the Indian physician Dr. Aziz tells us much about Forster's view of Indian Muslims - they are emotional, touchy, mercurial, proud, fond of practical jokes, impulsive, insecure, wary of outsiders, pious, tied to their land and culture, etc. - but Aziz as a person, as an individual, is lost along the way. He becomes too diffuse to seem real. Forster achieves more success with the character of Cyril Fielding, a British man who tries to maintain a friendly relationship with the native Indians. Fielding's personality undergoes subtle and not necessarily positive changes during the course of the novel. These changes, which are connected to the novel's larger themes, are revealed in a deft, understated manner which highlights Forster's skill as a writer.<br /><br />I am glad that I read this novel. It certainly was not a waste of my time and it gave me some insight into what life was like for both Indians and the British during this particular period of British colonial rule (tense!). However, I'm a little puzzled as to why it is hailed as one of the greatest books of the twentieth century. To me, this is the weakest of the Forster novels I have read.land and culture, etc. - but Aziz as a person, as an individual, is lost along the way. He becomes too diffuse to seem real. Forster achieves more success with the character of Cyril Fielding, a British man who tries to maintain a friendly relationship with the native Indians.

These changes, which are connected to the novel's larger themes, are revealed in a deft, understated manner which highlights Forster's skill as a writer.  I am glad that I read this novel. It certainly was not a waste of my time and it gave me some insight into what life was like for both Indians and the British during this particular period of British colonial rule (tense!). However, I'm a little puzzled as to why it is hailed as one of the greatest books of the twentieth century. To me, this is the weakest of the Forster novels I have read.
1456506862|3.0|This novel turned out to be much better than its first 75 pages would suggest. On the other hand, it's no \\"Great Gatsby.\\" At its best, it is a complex portrait of a disintegrating marriage. Fitzgerald is interested in the changes love undergoes within a marital relationship, and he approaches his subject from unexpected angles; his main characters, shallow in themselves, acquire surprising depth as partners in a failing romantic enterprise. At its worst, the novel is juvenile, immature in its subject matter and its style: Fitzgerald satirizes easy targets (e.g., fat women; social climbers trying to pass themselves off as members of a higher stratum; a Japanese servant with a limited grasp of the English language, etc.), and the plot eventually devolves into lurid melodrama. The ending is almost farcical. One gets the sense that Fitzgerald grew weary of the novel at a certain point and just decided to wrap it up quickly, ripping off \\"Sister Carrie\\" and \\"L'Assommoir\\" for a sensationalistic ending.<br /><br />The novel is divided into three sections. In Book I, we are introduced to the protagonist, Anthony Patch. He is a good-looking Harvard graduate, presumed heir to his grandfather's fortune, who resides in languorous splendor in a Fifty-second Street New York apartment. We also meet Gloria Gilbert, a beautiful and self-possessed young woman with whom Anthony falls in love. The back-cover of my Scribner paperback version describes the novel as \\"a devastating portrait of the nouveaux riches, New York night life, reckless ambition, and squandered talent.\\" This is a bit disingenuous. The novel talks a little about New York nightlife, but there's nothing about \\"reckless ambition.\\" In fact, the principal characters are utterly without ambition beyond a vague desire to be wealthy and fabulous. This is part of their problem. Anthony and Gloria have no specific goals, no hobbies, no passionate interest in anything except themselves and alcohol. \\"Squandered talent\\" is also a stretch. Anthony is presented as a flawed individual from the onset, but in Book I Fitzgerald is trying to convince us that his main character is nonetheless brilliant, a man of unlimited potential. Unfortunately, this is difficult to swallow. Anthony's supposed brilliance is on display when he engages in intellectual arguments and clever badinage with his Harvard buddies, but the dialogue is stilted and artificial. Fitzgerald fails to convince us that Anthony embodies youthful promise. Instead, Anthony comes across as a fop whose sense of entitlement is unjustified. This is a great weakness of the novel because in order for Anthony to fulfill his role as Talent Squandered in Book III, his potential for greatness should have been established in Books I or II.<br /><br />Book II, in which the marriage of Anthony and Gloria is dissected, is very well done. Although they initially were drawn to each other for reasons that do not bode well for a marriage - Gloria admires Anthony for being defiantly useless, \\"a brilliantly meaningless figure in a meaningless world,\\" while Anthony is entranced by Gloria's beauty, self-absorption, and indifference to him - for a while true love blossoms. It is an intense love, destined to burn brightly yet briefly. As the fervor cools, Fitzgerald traces the relationship's decline in meticulous, chronological detail, lingering over each stage of waning love and burgeoning contempt. Both characters are well delineated; they come to life in the reader's mind and seem ever more real as they grow further apart. Among other things, their marriage is affected by the simple fact that Gloria and Anthony are growing older and more mature. As far as Fitzgerald is concerned, maturation is not a good thing. Fitzgerald's fascination with youth is famous. His belief that life is effectively over after, say, the age of 23 is in evidence here, and anyone who believes that our nation's current obsession with youth is unique to this country or to our era should revisit Fitzgerald (or Boccaccio, for that matter) to be reminded that by the age of 29, a man has \\"ceased to be an individual of mental adventure, of curiosity, and (has) become an individual of bias and prejudice, with a longing to be emotionally undisturbed...We substitute rules of conduct for ideas of integrity, we value safety above romance, we become, quite unconsciously, pragmatic.\\"<br /><br />In Book III, Fitzgerald reexamines the philosophy upon which Anthony has structured his entire existence, the belief that \\"nothing much is worth doing.\\" Fitzgerald's characters are now approaching early middle age, and the author seems to be mourning the loss of their youthful arrogance. There's nothing wrong with being lazy and useless, Fitzgerald argues, as long as one is lazy and useless with panache. Only the young can pull this off successfully; middle-aged people, lacking bravado, merely become ineffectual. Likewise, only the young can be spectacularly callous like Gloria in Book I. Self-doubt and a sense of conscience creep in at a certain age. Anthony and Gloria are no more flawed than they were at the beginning of the novel, Fitzgerald seems to be saying, but now their flaws are less attractive.<br /><br />All in all, not bad. I give it 3.62 stars.ld (or Boccaccio, for that matter) to be reminded that by the age of 29, a man has \\"ceased to be an individual of mental adventure, of curiosity, and (has) become an individual of bias and prejudice, with a longing to be emotionally undisturbed...We substitute rules of conduct for ideas of integrity, we value safety above romance, we become, quite unconsciously, pragmatic.\\"   In Book III, Fitzgerald reexamines the philosophy upon which Anthony has structured his entire existence, the belief that \\"nothing much is worth doing.\\" Fitzgerald's characters are now approaching early middle age, and the author seems to be mourning the loss of their youthful arrogance.

B0064BCNA4|1.0|The only difference in this and the free version is the removal of ads. Because the ads were non intrusive anyway, this pro version has nothing new to offer. Like many apps, on first glance you consider the possibilities, but after using it disappointment sets in. The reality is that this app is incredibly basic, to the point were it alienates musicians and hinders those who are curious. You may actually get worse at piano because of the bad habits this app promotes, including reliance on single notes, limiting chords to two notes (admittedly a limitation of multitouch more than the app), and ruining any sense of rhythm the user may have had with an unforgiveable lag time between key presses.  The only use for this app is as a distraction for children, but only use it if you want to ensure they will lose interest in piano and music creation as a whole.
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|I have no way of knowing how many folks who come to this part of Amazon know what TAS is an acronym for. For those of you who do, and who recognize this album as one that many at the time considered a demonstration disc, in spite of its many obvious, production faults, this is going to be a revelation, as it should be. Those of you who have serious systems and definitely something serious for the playing of digital, this is an unequivocal, not to be missed remaster.  It's truly spectacular. Just order it if you care for the music.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|What does it matter if it's only a game anyway? Bringing Up Baby is a 1938 film directed by Howard Hawks. It stars a prime time Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant. This is a very stylish, smart, witty, charming, and classic funny film. Bringing Up Baby was essentially the first modern romantic screwball comedy. This over the top and outlandish story features dinosaur bones, dogs, leopards, drunks, multiple stolen cars, and jail time. It really never lets up from the start to the end. The story follows Susan Vance (Hepburn) and David Huxley (Cary Grant) as they try to hunt down an escaped leopard named Baby. The bulk of the film takes place at a country side home. Huxley is scheduled to be married and looking to secure a million grant for his museum. Everything comes completely unraveled from the moment Huxley meets Susan on the golf course. The crazier it gets the further they fall in love. Bringing Up Baby is a classic screwball comedy filled with romantic on screen chemistry.

The only drawback I found is that now is more expensive the kindle version than the paperback, but before it was half the price. Not worthy to pay so much for a book that is freely available by the authors.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|This is an interesting and often heartbreaking, even sometimes humorous, story of a woman who wants to tell the story of what it's like for the black  maids in Mississippi, 1963, to work for spoiled white folks in a segregated town, just as the civil rights movement is starting to gain momentum.  Total Oscar-bait, from the performances to the soundtrack to the production design.  That's fine; it's just rather obvious.    Kudos to the cast for making the characters so believable, from the hateful Hilly to the sympathetic maids.
B0026FCNK2|5.0|20-Dec-2011 (Blu-Ray edition)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0026FCNK2 12 Monkeys [Blu-ray]]] is a movie that really creeps me out - a believable end-of-the-world story.<br /><br />After watching this film - and reading Tom Clancy's [[ASIN:0425170349 Rainbow Six]] - it's easy to see how a group of whack-jobs might just be able to whip up a super-bug virus to cleanse the planet and set it loose.<br /><br />The cast principals, Willis, Stowe, and Pitt, are really great. Bruce Willis does a great job in a very physically-demanding role. Brad Pitt is particularly good as the chief nut-boy. Madeleine Stowe makes the best of her role as the psychiatrist, but her part doesn't strike me as written to be particularly deep. Just my opinion.<br /><br />I've played the Blu-Ray edition and love the audio and video quality. I have a good-but-not-gazillion-dollar home theater, and find the Blu-Ray presentation to be roughly equivalent to most theaters.<br /><br />I recommend this movie in any format.

B005GVA2L0|5.0|It's been so long since Evanescence released a CD, much less a DVD, but I kept on hoping. I have loved them forever. I placed an order for the deluxe edition of the album, which includes four bonus tracks and a DVD, and I must say that I am not the least bit disappointed with what I received today.   I've only begun to listen to the CD. I have only listened to the singles, but, from the sounds of it, the other, lesser-known songs are just what I expected. I know Amy has the tendency to play around with Evanescence's sound, so I wasn't surprised to listen to the style. In fact, I believe it's very refreshing and a little like their first CD. So far, the self-titled album is full of angst and melancholy. I can tell that Amy put her entire soul into the lyrics.   She really is a true artist.   Depending on what you're looking for, this might or mightn't be the CD for you. If you're a diehard fan, maybe. Me? This sates my craving for Evanescence just as well. I might update this review later on, but you should look at other reviews to get an idea of whether or not this CD is for you.

Of course there were a few tearjerker moments (happy tears), but more laughs than tears.
B0001HAISG|5.0|As a fan of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan, I'm surprised that I missed this movie when it was released. Fortunately, I came across it on television recently, and I was really impressed at the quality of the adaptation, as well as the credible performances by most of the cast members. The effects too are really spectacular, and brought the magical tale to life.<br /><br />The star performance is by the actor who portrays Peter Pan, as played by Jeremy Sumpter. Sumpter has this naturally cheeky and playful look, yet he can also convey vulnerability when the scene warrants it. Rachel Hurd-Wood is convincing as Wendy, and Jason Isaacs is suitably wicked in his role as the evil Captain Hook, though he also plays Mr. Darling (Wendy's dad). I did think the gorgeous Olivia Williams who beguiled viewers in her portrayal of Jane Austen in [[ASIN:B0012OVCE6 Sense & Sensibility / Miss Austen Regrets]] was rather wasted in her role as Mrs. Darling.<br /><br />2003's Peter Pan is definitely worth multiple viewings, and stays quite faithful to Barrie's work.

B0012V1ATQ|5.0|This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is the 1980 BBC miniseries,adapted by British novelist Fay Weldon and is a very faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. It consists of five episodes and stars the engaging Elizabeth Garvie as Ms Elizabeth Bennet and the aristocratic-looking and handsome David Rintoul as Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.<br /><br />This was the first adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I watched, almost 16 years ago back when I was in college, and till today it remains one of my favorite adaptations of Austen's works, right up there with the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. In fact, both Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul do a very credible job portraying the lead roles.<br /><br />Although Jennifer Ehle was charming and feisty in her role in the 1995 version, Elizabeth Garvie makes a spirited Elizabeth and a very attractive, bright woman. She delivers her lines with great spirit and I was utterly charmed by her performance. Her chemistry with Mr. Darcy was also very believable, from the early days of misunderstanding and tension to the gradual growing of affection between them. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as popular as Colin Firth's but he definitely brings a certain dignity and charm of his own to the role.<br /><br />As for the adaptation of the novel itself, the 1980 version is more faithful than the 1995 version, as it also contains about 75 extra minutes of dialogue that adds to the authentic feel of the adaptation. The rest of the casting in the 1980 adaptation was also well-done - Priscilla Morgan is hilarious as Mrs Bennet,Moray Watson is wonderful as the beleaguered Mr Bennet,Sabina Franklyn as the very beautiful and very nice Jane Bennet, Marsha Fitzalan made a very conniving Caroline Bingley and Judy Parfitt is perfect as the haughty and meddlesome Lady Catherine de Bourgh. However, I must admit that I preferred the 1995 casting with respect to the roles of Mr Collins [suitably oily], Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.<br /><br />In Episode 3, poor Jane Bennet pines for Mr. Bingley after his abrupt departure together with his party (which includes the odious Ms. Bingley, her sister, brother-in-law, and of course, Mr. Darcy). Elizabeth suspects Ms. Bingley to be behind this surprising turn of events, as she feels strongly that Charles Bingley truly loves her sister.<br /><br />The only thing I deem a flaw in this older adaptation is the poor production quality - the lighting is too dull and scenes of dancing at the balls are very uninspired with cheap looking, very small sets that don't enhance the dramatization. It's a pity for with better production values, this could have been a stellar production given that it had a great screenplay and wonderful acting.<br /><br />On the whole, I find it hard to fault this adaptation. It will always remain one of my favorite adaptations, not just of Pride and Prejudice, but of Austen's works as it is very faithful and well-cast. I recommend this to all Austen fans and also those who have only watched the 1995 adaptation and the 2005 movie version starring Keira Knightley.Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.

B0050AV5MW|5.0|OK, first to dispel some earlier concerns about the kindle version. The problems have been ironed out with my version. Now what about the books themselves? They're not 'The Lord of the Rings' and Robin Hobbs is a better contemporary fantasy stylist. But for a dazzling, sprawling yarn you can't go past this series. Martin has cleverly created a world filled with fascinating characters thrown into incredibly difficult situations, and the format of each chapter told from the perspective of a different character inevitably leads one by the nose to keep reading to find out what happens next. Unlike others I didn't find \\"A Feast of Crows\\" tedious. Rather I was interested in the character development, along with the description of different lands and cities mentioned in previous books. Upon finishing the 4th book I immediately downloaded the next (while commuting on a train) and avidly began \\"A Dance with Dragons\\". The dangers of the kindle, instant gratification and reduced bank account.

0061251321|4.0|After finishing this book and checking my notes, I did enjoy the high level, 30,000 ft view of tribe and it's implications on an organization. What I didn't walk away from this book are many suggestions on how to improve or help move myself and my people up to a greater stage. Sure, there are a few ideas and I guess one very valuable lesson is self recognition. I work in a sales environment that (small picture) is competitive with itself so having a tribe that says \\"we are the best\\" simply doesn't fit. After reading this book I see my tribe and myself as a certain 3. But as the book warns, don't box yourself into a score. Like I mentioned earlier, it's a useful book to evaluate your current situation and that could be worth the cost of the book alone. In summary, a useful book on workplace evaluations but lacking real world usefulness.

0307949508|5.0|This sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is filled with nearly non-stop action, political complexity, puzzles, confusion, and every other possible emotion and event. With over 700 pages, the author, now deceased, manages to keep the pages turning and never lose the interest of the reader. Lisbeth Salander, independently wealthy after brilliantly manipulating a former crime lord's portfolio, is in many ways the anti-hero as she delivers her own brand of principled conduct and seeks to punish those who mistreat her and other women. Her unusual intellect, surpassing that of most geniuses, blends easily with her resourcefulness and assertive action when needed. Having few supporters and even less who recognize her brilliance, Salander takes on the criminal world without hesitation in spite of a plethora of obstacles and challenges.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist, whom we met in Dragon Tattoo, is back at work at the Millenium producing articles and helping his partner and sometime lover Erika Berger with the magazine. Accepting the work of another author and his journalist partner, Mikael becomes embroiled in an expose' of the sex trade in Sweden. Verifying all sources and working to make sure all research is accurate, Mikael uncovers a criminal activity that includes police officers, state officials, gangs, and thugs. Eventually connecting the sources of the trade to Lisbeth Salander's background, Mikael remains her defender and friend to the very end, all the while not understanding why she refuses to speak with him.<br /><br />The book opens with Lisbeth Salander in the Caribbeans fighting through a tropical storm/tornado while trying to save the life of the wife of a fraudulent doctor. Returning to her home and taking up a lesbian alliance with a former friend, Lisbeth is suddenly accused of killing three people. Circumstantial evidence points to her involvement and she finds herself hiding from the police and from the thugs trying to end her life. Using incredible hacking skills and advanced technology, Lisbeth stays several steps ahead of those wanting to hurt her. She is quick, resourceful, and constantly aware of the danger that is around her. Yet she never seeks help except in the most dire of circumstances.<br /><br />As the police put together a team to bring in Salander for the killing of three people, the truth begins to unravel and we discover a connection to her past. Salander's connection to Bjurnam who was one of those killed further points to her as the murderer. Corruption within the detective ranks, impotent leadership, and an inability to decipher the confusing misdirection of the investigation, all contributed to a lack of discernment and action on the part of the police force. Determined to bring her in, but not entirely convinced of her guilt, Bublanski deals with traitorous action and hatred for women by fellow officers. As the story moves along, we encounter Salander's former guardian as he recovers from a stroke, and meet up with several killers and criminals associated with the sex trade. By the end, we learn the horrific details of Lisbeth Salander's childhood and find ourselves cheering for her success in putting an end to the sex trade activities.<br /><br />The action and the sex abound eagerly in this volume as the book moves rapidly from scene to scene. We share in Salander's fear and we empathize with her challenges. Unlike many contemporary books where it seems there are few redeeming character traits in the main players, in this book we clearly know who are the protagonists versus the antagonists. Along the journey we enjoy the mathematical allusions and the advanced technology terminology. We marvel at the writing style and we wonder about an underground world of crime that may exist all around us. But perhaps the best part of this great book is the reminder that events of the past including abuse, violence, and false labeling can create a lifetime of misery for the recipient. Each characteris shaped by a combination of his or her environment and inherited DNA. As we learn about the complexities of the people and Lisbeth Salander in particular, we may just find ourselves being more patient and tolerant of those who are different. At the same time, we just may become even more intolerant of those perpetrating abuse and violence on the world.<br /><br />I gave this 5 stars because of my inability to put it aside. While there are greater works of literature, and it in no way compares to Graham Greene or many of the great writers of literature, it certainly is a compelling read and highly recommended. Be warned there are some explicit scenes and several liberal themes with which to contend. In the end, worth every page.her environment and inherited DNA.

B003MC5N28|3.0|First I would like to say that I am probably not the intended audience for this book. I read this as filler while waiting for other books to become available on my local library's overdrive site.   Though I enjoyed most of the book, the conclusion left me empty. It was as if the author lost the 2nd half, or couldn't be bothered to write an epilogue. To be honest, I would have felt cheated if it had taken more than an hour to finish.   Judging this as a work of science fiction for all audiences, which might be unfair, the end could have been grimmer or the climax more chaotic to add gravitas to the protagonist's final actions.     Imagining myself as a 10 to 12 year old, this book would have gone back to the library after the 3rd chapter. It would not have held my interest like 1984 & Animal Farm, nor had the moral effect of the Black Cauldron series, all of which I had read by that age.  Maybe the reason for the Newbery award was that it was digestible enough to be added to 4th and 5th grade reading plans.

Maybe at a little slower pace than in the old days, but what he lacks in exuberance, he makes up for in in-the-trenches, sage wisdom.    I love his hand-off approach to actors, something I had heard a little about, but it became more clear in this documentary.  He's the opposite of a \\"control freak\\" which I think is neat for someone is his position.  I love the way he doesn't really care if people like his movies, and then, when it is least expected, he makes a \\"Midnight in Paris\\" which is now quietly gaining attention in a way that was not expected - yay!  The only thing I REALLY REALLY miss is Woody starring in his movies.  I don't like it when he casts others in \\"his\\" part - because only HE can be HIM.  The only actor that works in \\"his spot\\" would be Larry David - that I can buy.  But I hope he will consider starring in his movies again - I really miss him, so for now, I will have to be content watching Annie Hall, Play It Again Sam, Manhattan and Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex (my favorites) over and over again.  I see Annie Hall and Manhattan will be released on Blu-Ray end of Jan 2012 - can't wait, and wish this documentary and other movies of his would come out on blu-ray.

B001QOGYBI|2.0|We were looking forward to seeing this film with our kids, but just couldn't like it. Our dislike of the movie doesn't come through an inability to enjoy Wes Anderson, as we have seen and enjoyed \\"Rushmore\\", \\"The Life Aquatic\\", \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\", and \\"The Squid and the Whale\\".<br /><br />I couldn't help thinking what a dull movie it would be if one just replaced the animal heads with human heads.  To us as diehard Dahl fans, the movie failed to capture the spirit of the book... it winked at the adults too much and really did not speak to children.  The main characters were prettified and yet charmless. The dialogue... meh. It was kind of a generic rom-com but because the characters are animals, it must be for kids, right?<br />As a children's movie, may compare with Pixar, but really not in the league of Aardman Animations or Miyazaki. But then again, what is?

Superb storytelling with an especially strong an subtle performance from Shannon.
B005AFB69E|5.0|I'll start by saying that Ladyhawke is one of my all-time favorite romances.  I finally took a chance and spent the @$40 to upgrade the rather mediocre dvd to blu-ray. Rarely have I been happier with a blu-ray purchase!  The enhancement to my enjoyment of the movie is amazing!  I'm no techie, but I am very visual, and practically purred over the improvement.  It was like discovering the movie all over again.  If you are hesitating, I can say that my purchase through David Ho (boyoyo) went smoothly.  It took a bit of time to get here from Hong Kong, but nothing unreasonable.  And the disk was unopened and in perfect condition.  In fact, I used to have to fix the language setting on my dvd, but no such issues here.  Wonderful!!!!
B0000DJZ8R|3.0|Fine performances and gorgeous cinematography. Some powerful moments offset by others in which the heavy hand of polemics destroys the credibility of the scene. Illustrated the casual generosity of people sharing hard times contrasted with the casual cruelty and brutality of those in positions of authority - with an apparent fear of losing their precarious stability and relative prosperity driving much of the cruelty and brutality.  It's a beautiful film to watch with especially strong performances especially from John Carradine, Jane Darwell, and Henry Fonda.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|I've always been amazed at the huge following and generous ratings and reviews this film has received. Though it does have its merits, overall I found Requiem for a Dream to be very disappointing. The plot itself offers absolutely nothing new - three friends that fall prey to the horrors of addiction and their lives spiral... how many times have we seen this, and done much, much better for that matter?<br /><br />This is director Darren Aronofsky's sophomore (and sophomoric) effort. While Pi was excellent, Aronofsky uses, as another reviewer excellently puts it, &#34;gimmicky camera and editing&#34; and other bad, stylistic shock value techniques such as the extreme accounts of each character's sub-story to attempt to create a dream like or surreal experience, the obvious point of the film, and it simply doesn't work.<br /><br />Even as a recovering addict myself, I felt no connection or empathy towards the characters, except for perhaps the mother character, played by Ellen Burstyn, in part due to her performance and the fact that her story offers something refreshing from the otherwise stale, hackneyed dreck that constitutes this<br />lame attempt to marry art with a hollywood blockbuster. It is absolutely embarrassing watchhing Leto attempt a New York accent, and watching Jennifer Connolly act is like watching paint dry.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem I had with the film was its ending, or maybe it was just the whole damn thing and the feeling you're left with... the problem doesn't lie in the writing but the direction - you are left with this residue-like feeling that the story is shaking its finger at you... as if you just watched a DARE film, not a piece of art. It WOULD normally be refreshing to watch a film about addiction film that doesn't glorify/romanticize drugs - this film does not glorify drugs obviously, however unfortunately, it's terrible.<br /><br />Some scenes, particularly Connolly's lesbian sex scene, displayed the lengths to which one will go when the disease of chemical dependency/addiction takes over... The problem, though, wasn't that it was explicit so much as it was dragged out long after it made its point, latent with desperate self gratuitous direction.<br /><br />Bottom line is it failed to accomplish what it desperately attempts, making &#34;Requiem for a Dream&#34; a rather pretentious title. The only scenes that<br />remotely induced a successful feeling of surrealism for me were Burstyn's, and I think that was mostly because it offered something mildly different and the POV shots worked.<br /><br />This was painful.y/addiction takes over...

B004GJYR7I|5.0|Whip smart rapid fire banter and a breakneck pace propel you through a sort-of-romance screwball comedy with dark and cynical undertones. Actually, they may be more overtones - it's pretty dark and cynical for a screwball romantic comedy. But, man, does it work.
0761158820|5.0|I picked up this book over the weekend in a toy shop and I have already made 3 of these monsters.  I have to admit, I bought this for myself.  These monsters are fantastic.  I've been using a glue stick with no problem.  I would recommend this book to anyone that loves crafting and puzzles.  It is well designed with 1 page for the description and instructions on how to put together each monster and 1 page to pull out with a heavy cardstock type of paper that you can punch out your monster.    To Brian Castleforte, please please please make more books like this, I would buy them all up!
B000000W6R|4.0|I like this album. It's just a bunch of B-sides, but i think they are good B-sides. \\"Frail & Bedazzled,\\" \\"Plume,\\" and \\"La Dolly Vita\\" are my favorite tracks on the album. And of course, this album has a great (i think) remake of \\"Landslide.\\" It's a great album for a Pumpkins fan.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote works well as a private journal or diary that can be accessed on any computer or mobile device. It has similar features to popular social network sites such as Facebook or Twitter, but keeps it at a personal level without sharing any of your entries unless you choose to do so. A nice alternative for those who like social networking features while being able to keep your thoughts private.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I can describe this book in one word, but Amazon requires 20 or more. This book was perfect. Abby and Travis are perfect. The plot and story line are perfect! I cried and laughed and blushed lol. I'm very picky when it comes to reading and this oversaw  my expectations by miles. highly recommended if you love 'love' lol.
B005N95JA4|3.0|I'll just go ahead and say that I am not a 57 year old Stones fanatic, and so I don't own any of the 45's or 78's that others are mentioning in their posts. I also don't hear anything at all wrong in the sound quality of either disc. I do agree with what others have said that the 2nd CD could have included a little more, but what was included was stuff that I don't already own and I enjoyed a lot. (Favorites include 'No Spare Parts' and 'So Young')<br /><br />That said, I hate this flimsy cardboard box. I'm way anal-retentive about my CDs and CD cases, and this thing is going to get torn up. Worst part is that the art is the box itself, so I can't even transfer it to a slim 2-CD case (Like I did with my Hot Rocks set oh so many ages ago).<br /><br />The liner notes? May as well not even be there. They are strictly credits for who did what on which song and nothing else. Oh boy... You know I could forgive crummy cardboard packaging if there was a booklet worth having. (See the AC/DC rereleases from 2001 I believe. Cardboard packaging, but very nicely presented.) I'm ever so bothered by the fact that the -lyrics- aren't even included for the album proper. (I might not be a completist, but I am a dork about reading lyrics.)<br /><br />I do hate to give this less than five stars because the album itself is gold. One of my favorites easily. Perhaps I just feel it deserved a little better than what it got. What can you do?

B0015DROBO|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with this book primarily because, in several instances, I had to suspend belief in order to buy into Larsen's plot, but it was an interesting enough read for me to get through it.  I was annoyed however that the author apparently doesn't think his readers are smart enough to 'connect the dots' and figure things out for themselves and had to rely on explanation to ensure his intent got across to us.  I like books with a foreign flavor but I find novels like  John Elray's  [[ASIN:B003FMUZ8W Pattaya Beach]]  , a contemporary drama set in Thailand, to be a much more satisfying read.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Classic Stephen King<br /><br />Perfect read for somebody interested in trying out their new e-reader. I read this on my iphone, and it was just the right length.
B002MZKQ32|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. Kahald Hosseini did an excellent job of describing a culture that I had never know about. He drew me in with his words and entangled me with the characters lives so when they felt pain, I felt pain for them, and when the character was hopeless, I wish I could have been there to help them. My favorite part about this book is the way the author reveals to the readers what is going on in each chapter. For example, when something important happens, you never know exactly what is happening until the second page or so. The author only gives hints of the upcoming action until he decides to reveal it to you. I love that about the book, because it kept me in suspense and I always want to know what was happening next. Also, I am glad the author kept the \\"happy\\" part about this book and saved it till the end. Saving the joy till the end contrasted against all of the hardships that the characters faced made the ending so wonderful and powerful. Read this book!!!

0143038419|1.0|I think that this is the most annoying, self-absorbed book I have ever, EVER read. Let's see, a very wealthy woman goes through a nasty divorce but has enough money to take 1-1/2 yrs to find herself. No bills to worry about, no children, no job to keep her down. Just herself. And she is so distraught that she decides to explore food, then prayer, then love. This book could be renamed EAT, PRAY, PUKE. I will give her this: she had the dough to get this best PR firm and do a massive, masterful promotion and media hype, even Oprah. Because of that, she sold a million books. so what?
1609611543|4.0|My neighbor mentioned she had an intolerance to gluten, and I thought it would be great to learn more about this (especially since I love to cook and would like to keep my weight down around the holidays.) I picked this book because of the great reviews and the huge stack of bagels on the cover (admit it, you did, too!) Dr. Davis keeps his tone light and is funny throughout this book, but he has so much information on how eliminating wheat can make you healthier and happier. Though I may not use ALL his recipes (lots of oils, cheese, coconut milk...too many calories for my small body, I'm afraid) I do like how he explains everything and am trying to go wheat-free in my cooking. It's helped cut down on the bloated feeling I often get when eating breads, pasta, & cereals, so it's working! I also enjoyed the book \\"Cook Right 4 Your Type,\\" so combining what I've learned from these two books should be perfect for me.
0811879542|5.0|This book is totally great!  It is like a touch screen app in book form.  What a unique and fun idea!  My 9 year old daughter absolutely loves it and has read it several times. The rest of my family and I like it a lot too.  Many loud claps for this book!

B005DF2QMC|1.0|I bought this via Amazon.  Used it for a few days copying old tapes of language lessons.  Seemed OK.  Then, when I copied music, I began to notice the notes were badly off pitch. Sour notes.  Tried different tapes.  No difference.  Should note that these were classical and traditional vocal, not rock music. Assuming this was the result of crud on the heads, I cleaned the heads.  No improvement. Put the tapes in the player in my car.  Pitch was right.  So it was not a problem with the tapes.  Tried a different PC.  Off pitch.  Swapped USB cables.  Off pitch.    It was clear that the tape drive was out of adjustment.  No way for user to adjust.  Do these people know about 440 A? There must be a tape somewhere that puts out 440 A.  We can buy inexpensive guitar, etc. tuners so it is not asking a lot for these drives to be adjusted before being shipped.    Only reasonable solution was to toss this into the trash. At this price, it would cost far too much to return it or to have a technician repair it. Will try to find another brand.  This time I will triple check that there is an adjustment screw which is user accessible without having to disassemble the device.  A hole in the back cover with a rubber plug would work. Not exactly brain surgery.    If you look at the other cassette USB to CD listings, you will see that this same device is sold with a number of brands - and sometimes cheaper.  Read the one-star reviews of these.  Some of them cite the same problems I had.  No way to correct slow turning of the capstan.  Horrible.  Simply horrible piece of junk.
B005ZUR724|4.0|this game is like WOW but a heck of a lot cheeper. it responds great on the kindle and looks great to! if u like action and rpg's or mmorpg's then get this game. Update \\"1/1/12\\" allot of people who bought the game for the past week could not play it. But they could not play it because they needed and update but game loft did not put one out right away. but this is an mmo on a phone it is not a pc so it is not instantaneous, they have to put the update on then amazon has to approve it. So the game works fine people just need to calm down and relax. Works wonderful now, just chill out. Also the updated went up during Christmas when game loft was most likely closed. So give them a break lol.
1576875776|5.0|I don't care what Maier used to make her images with.  Her images (note I do not use photographs!!!) are as good as or better than the major journalistic and street \\"photographers\\" of the 19th and 20th and maybe this Century.  She has the ablity to capture the moment and the soul of her subjects.  Each image stands on its own.  I do not have the adjectives to express how I feel when I look at her images.  They are just plain great!  It may not be PC to say that I thank God we are allowed to see them and that they were not discarded.  There are two other museum books of her works and I have order them and can't wait to get them.  Thank you Vivian Maier.

B004UJAOLM|3.0|Why I waited until I was middle-aged to start reading the classics, I'll never know, but I'm glad that I did.  When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Wuthering Heights.  I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used, but the characters, all of them, were mean, hateful, self-centered people.  I thought it would be another book where the good guy gets tramped on as a child but comes out on top as an adult, but that never happened.  People kept doing all of the wrong things for all of the wrong reasons.<br /><br />I'm still glad that I read it, because it was interesting, but I can't really say that I'd want to recommend it to anyone else.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a great application for taking notes and making lists. It is intuitive and so far has the functionality I need.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Why I waited until I was middle-aged to start reading the classics, I'll never know, but I'm glad that I did.  When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Little Women.  I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used.  I had heard about this book many times over the years as a must-read chick-lit, but had never taken the time to do it.  I even remember them talking about this book on an episode of Friends.  Now I'm really glad that I've read it.<br /><br />The four Little Women are sisters in the March family, who has gone from fortune to working-class when their father became a preacher and went off to the War.  At first, they regret losing their wonderful rich things and beautiful clothing, but through time and with their mother's coaching, they learn that money isn't as important as helping others and loving others.<br /><br />There are wonderful parts of the story that highlight each daughter's quest for marriage and grows into her own.  Watching each girl grow up into mature women was like seeing your niece grow up, mature, and turn into a new person.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|This is a true masterpiece of a historical film. The facts are told as they were, with as much attention to detail as one can expect in two hours. The American and Japanese approach to the final show-down are related very well, with the necessary detachment to maintain objectivity and yet with enough passion to make the viewer feel involved. I had read a lot about these events and still, I felt emotionally moved. There were reasonable people on both sides in 1941, and war might have been avoided if they had prevailed. Among them, the towering figure of Admiral Yamamoto is central to the whole story.<br /><br />This movie is from 1970, so no computer generated imagery, no special effects really, at least not as we are accustomed today, but lots of real planes flying and real fires!<br /><br />The Blue-ray quality of this set is stunning, incredible for a movie that is 40 years old, and the extended Japanese cut makes for a more thorough experience.<br /><br />Also, the accompanying interviews with the directors and some historians and survivors add another hour and a half of interesting background.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I was not interested in this book, but I heard the movie was coming out and wanted to make sure to read it first.  O-M-G! You do not know what you are missing!!  I could NOT put this book down.  It was especially hard at night (which is when I usually read) to put this book down so that I could get up in the morning.  It only took me a couple nights to read!  A must read for people of any age!<br /><br />If you have ever read 1984 or Anthem, there are some themes from those that you will notice in this book as well.  Soooo good!

B0052UZIFA|2.0|I love this game, but not the port for the Android. we have a.copy on the iPhone and it has a Zen garden and other mini games available for it. I purchased this thinking it would be the same full port. for almost $4 I would expect it to be at least the same as the $3 iPhone version.  Hopefully they release a patch with the additional content. Buyer Beware.
B00479SVBU|5.0|My husband drives a company truck all day that is not equipped with a CD player or AUX input. I wanted to find a way for him to listen to his own music without having to tie up his iPhone, so I bought this with a 4GB SD card. I just received this product and tested it out last night and love it! I have Sirius satellite radio and have also tried numerous FM transmitters for the iPhone. In our city, it's almost impossible to find a radio frequency that you can transmit clearly on, but this device works perfectly on several stations. In addition, it is easy to navigate and the remote control means that he can easily operate the device without being distracted from driving.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is the first app I've felt the need to review simply because I was blown away after first using it. I'm using a Sprint HTC EVO 3D and this app runs flawlessly, to date.  Installation is real simple and adequate instruction is provided. I sync'd the app with my desktop and laptop over WiFi and the connection was instant, literally. There was no lag controlling my computers and the controls are real simple and nothing new if you're used to controlling your phone.   I ran a full .avi movie and it ran flawlessly. If you are a Spotify user, you will be glad to know that you can run it through this app for free. When I was done, I simply shut down my computer as usual, but from the app and the connection was terminated.  The size of your phone or tablet screen will definitely affect your experience with this. But so far, this is the one app I can honestly see myself using for a long time. This app would be perfect if it could awaken your computer or start it but it is still well deserving of 5 stars, and my first review.  Hope you all can enjoy it as well.

145265364X|3.0|I am almost finished with Dragon Bound, and I have been deciding whether or not to order the second book in the series.  I finally decided that although the book is not great, it isn't bad either.  I am invested and interested enough in Pia and Dragos to continue with the series.  But then I read the reviews of the next book, and found out that it is about two characters who had only bit parts in book 1. The world building and writing style are not bad, but without the main characters, what's the point?  I have already ordered the first book in another series.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|A story that will chill you, `Sarah's Key' is a beautifully composed film about a terrible secret that consumes the life of a middle aged journalist.  Recently moved to Paris with her husband, Julia is researching the Vel d'Hiv round up for a piece in her magazine.  The French atrocity took place in Paris in the early 40's when Jews were collected en mass and sent to concentration camps.  The treatment and conditions subjected to these men and women (and children) were horrific, and all the more alarming considering that it stemmed from the French and not the Nazis.<br /><br />`Sarah's Key' is siphoned between two stories, that of Julia's discovery and that of a young girl named Sarah, who was sucked into the Vel d'Hiv round up as a child.  Scared and unknowing, Sarah makes a grave mistake by locking her young brother in the closet of her home, assuming that the men at her front door are going to harm him.  When she and her mother and eventually her father become part of the round up, her fears turn even more morbid as she realizes her brother may never get out of that closet (which she locked from the outside).  She then makes it her goal to escape the camp she's placed in and make her way back to her brother.  Julia, in present day Paris, happens to be living in the very same apartment where Sarah's brother was trapped all those years ago.  The apartment belonged to her husband's family, which stirs up anger and resentment and guilt in Julia as she questions their foreknowledge of the Vel d'Hiv round up itself.<br /><br />The performances here are all noteworthy.  Kristen Scott Thomas is outstanding as Julia.  I've always loved this woman, and here she proves why.  Her body language alone is just transcending.  She knows how to use her limbs in a way that emote so much, whether they be tense or loose; she carries them perfectly.  Young Melusine Mayance is wonderful as Sarah, capturing so much pain and remorse in her young eyes.  I may have been most moved by Natasha Mashkevich, though, who was spectacular as Sarah's young mother.  The worry, the pain, the fear, the undying love and devotion; it all embeds itself on her beautiful face.<br /><br />In the end, `Sarah's Key' is a great film.  It is heartbreaking (get ready to cry, you will) and it is moving.  I felt that the treatment of Julia's character could have been tighter, considering that her character arc seems rather unprecedented when you engage the entire scope of what she was learning.  Her marital failings were unnecessary and didn't add to the heart of the film, but they didn't take too much away either.  Still, this is an experience that one does well to embrace.<br /><br />And for those of you afraid of subtitles, this one has them for it is a FRENCH film, despite the fact that Kristen Scott Thomas and Aidan Quinn (and even Niels Arestrup) can speak English ;-)ugh, who was spectacular as Sarah's young mother.

1451627289|3.0|His career arc is familiar to most.  Greatness early on (The Stand, etc.) followed by meh later (The Cell).  But I read all his new books for the same reasons we watched Mike with the Wizards and listen to Jay-Z's watch the Throne-we know it's probably gonna be just okay....but based on their past it could be great.  In fairness I'm 28 so the Kennedy killing did not affect me as it would someone who was of age in 1963.  However, King has written many books set in the 50/60's (It, Hearts in Atlantis) and I loved those for the most part.  With that being said, here goes.  Length:  I cringe when I see stevie's books at this length.  In short story form is usually excellent, but in my opinion few tales need 800-1000 pages to tell (hello Under the Dome ) and this is not one of them.  Had it been tighter, it would have been much better.  Story:  The activities surrounding Kennedy's death and the attempts to stop it, I as a 28 year old found painfully boring.  However, there is a large portion of the book that is a love story and a thriller (Derry is back) that I really enjoyed for the most part.  It's just that listening to conversations and following people can be very boring when not skillfully done.  Writing:  Beautiful prose in places (think Bag of Bones), quick but great imagery in others (think Mrs. Todd's Shortcut), and just bad in others.  I found it amusing in the afterward he makes fun of a writer's \\"purple's prose\\".  when I can find several in this book that were far worse than that example.  A \\"gorgeous man's wallet\\" comes to mind.  Overall, the writing is uneven.  Occasionally beautiful and thought provoking, occasionally stinks, most of the time does what writing should...tell the story.  Characters:  Thomas Hardy supposedly said: Compared to the dullest human being, the most brilliantly drawn character in a novel is but a bag of bones.  Well most of these characters are brilliantly drawn and feel real.  King has always been great in this respect.  They allfeel right and operate in your mind as people.  Unfortunately, the first part of the Hardy quote also applies...they were dull and uninteresting.  Few of them will I remember besides AL and the Yellow Card Man (and this are for the most part 3rd tier characters).  The others though real were boring.  So I cared more about the plot than them.  Some like Clayton were right out of serial killer 101...very cartoonish.  Plot:  The love story:  Okay.  He did this beautifully in countless novels, but here just okay.  So the premise and Act 1 were intriguing and exciting, the parts with Derry and all that occurs are great, the last say 15 percent/Act 2 was good.  What does that leave?  A boring too long middle-where he just writes and writes.  Where 5 pages could have been three paragraphs and not hurt the story.  Overall:  Just okay.  Not the greats as I seem em (The Stand, Shining, Bag of Bones, The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet) but not horrible.  Like I said if you'r in your 50s or older you probably would love this (as I would a story about someone trying to stop 911) but the characters, length, and overall dullness at some points makes it just okay.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|This is Payne's best film since \\"Election,\\" which I think is the most sophisticated and smartest American film since \\"The Apartment,\\" in other words: a half-century.  Such words might be interpreted either as high praise for Alexander or simply a damning comment about the puerile film culture in contemporary America.  Some will find \\"The Descendents\\" sentimental and soft.  I found it excruciatingly layered.  There were scenes in which one wants to laugh and cry-- and tear one's hair out-- all in the same breath.  The characters are perverse (sometimes in ways which feel contrived and slightly cute).  Yet they all attain a kind of dignity.  Some will find this formulaic.  I found it graceful.    If comedy is the highest form of drama,  then what we are witnessing with Alexander Payne is a return to the greatness we used to take for granted in Hollywood.    The Coen Brothers are often cited as evidence that a high film culture still exists, and indeed their greatest films (\\"Fargo,\\"  \\"No Country for Old Men,\\") are impressive.  But (with a few notable exceptions (\\"The Big Lebowski\\"),  they substitute a high style for a light touch.  The light touch is far harder to achieve, and Payne is working his way towards it.    Incidentally, in \\"The Descendents,\\"  Payne does pull off a couple of moments of pure visual poetry, especially when he tracks George Clooney as he stalks the grinning real estate goon with whom Clooney's wife had \\"strayed.\\"  They are grace notes in an otherwise utilitarian visual experience (even lush Hanalei Bay comes across as somehow drab in this film)  but Payne's movies offer something far richer than eye candy.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Plays well with only a mildly annoying add between games.  Fast action, easy to use, nice special effects once you win.
B004SEVPWQ|3.0|why does this game freeze so much.. and at times, why doesn't it display my player name, instead of being listed as Player01..... I'm on the Verizon Thunderbolt, and have 4G and WiFi at all times.. no reason for the freezing up...  other than, that, I'm a Hell of a player.. lookout for the BigLouDog.....
B003L77GGK|5.0|This sixth season is essential. It has to be Solomon's season. It means everyone and everything is facing double choices, if not twice double or even three times double. Things become very complicated and at the end you are just amazed that all our \\"friends\\" have survived. At the same time it seems that complexity is the fact that several lines are used at the same time to create havoc and chaos. The line of the stealing of God's weapons is hardly used twice with the Staff of Moses and Gabriel's Horn of Truth, though this one was a false alarm. This use of that line seems to be a diversion in the season, though it brings a nice diversion in the plot by throwing Sam and Dean onto the set of the TV series known as Supernatural and then they are confronted with their \\"civilian\\" identities and realities while Castiel is planning the capture of the keys to the cupboard or cabinet or closet in which God's weapons are stored. When Castiel finally succeeds against Crowley, the demon Virgil and the ambushed Raphael, he brings the boys back into their real world of Supernatural.<br /><br />Another line is more consistent in the season. It is the line of the Mother of All, though it is a side line too. It is essential because it crosses many episodes. It is important too because it reveals something about the Campbells, the \\"family\\" of Samuel Campbell, the grandfather, dead and damned but brought back by Crowley for a very special mission. He, surrounded by his grandchildren (Sam as well, but not Dean at first), is tracking down what is called Alphas, the first monster of each kind, in order to get access to Purgatory. Being hunted, all the various types of monsters react by awakening their original creator, their mother, called the Mother of All and named Eve. Brought on Earth, Eve will try to protect her children against the more and more aggressive hunters.<br /><br />This line is very disruptive because to kill the Mother of All, who is transforming everyone she touches into Jefferson Starships (an invention of the Winchesters), Starships for short, monsters of a new hybrid nature, to kill her they need the ashes of a Phoenix, which is rare. That leads them back to Samuel Colt (another Samuel, another Sam) we already know since he is the one who built the giant Devil's trap that blocked the Devil's Gate that was opened in an earlier season. Dean and Sam need then to go back to March 5, 1861 when according to his journal, Colt killed a phoenix. That gives us a nice remake of a remake of a Clint Eastwood film via Back to the Future. The Phoenix was hanged in a small frontier place and he revived on the following morning and came back to burn the three people he considered miscarried justice. Which he does. But Dean has become the sheriff in the mean time and Sam is trying to bring Colt and instead of the man he will bring THE Colt that can kill demons and phoenixes. Sam will arrive just in time to give the gun to Dean who will summon Flinch (that's the name of the phoenix) to a duel in the main street and he will kill the Phoenix who will burn down into ashes. But Castiel will bring them back before they could collect the prize and without bringing the gun back. Luckily the US Postal Service delivers a package from a certain Samuel Colt that contains the ashes, a letter and a broken portable telephone Dean or Sam had left behind, but not the Colt.<br /><br />This episode will lead to the confrontation with the Mother of All and she will ask Dean and Sam to become her allies. Dean will refuse blankly and provoke her into biting him, which was deadly for her because Dean had gotten a refill in Phoenix ashes just before. Then Castiel and Crowley clean up the plate.<br /><br />That leads us to the first and essential complication  of this season: the couple Castiel Crowley who are dancing page after page between life, death and eternal anything (life, death, void, suffering, enjoying, you name it you have it).<br /><br />Sam was brought back at the beginning of the season from the cage where he was locked up with Lucifer, Michael and of course his half brother Adam. It remains a well kept secret about who did it. It will be revealed later on it was Castiel. But this Sam is soulless and is recuperated by another revived corpse, Samuel Campbell, the grandfather who was killed in some earlier season. But it is revealed then that this Samuel was brought back up by Crowley, the King of Hell in the absence of Lucifer, who wanted two things: a guarantee and some servants. He will get the guarantee from Bobby who will accept to give him his soul for ten years provided he saved Sam. But that was a lure. On the other side Crowley wants Samuel Campbell and some others in his family on the Campbell's side (some being possessed demons) to work for him under the promise he will bring Mary Campbell, the mother of Dean and Sam, back to life. The job is to capture monsters, especially alpha-monsters (first monster on a line) For Samuel or Crowley to torture them in order to get from them the location of the gate to Purgatory.<br /><br />But at the same time Castiel wants access to this Purgatory (and we can imagine Raphael wants it too) in order to recuperate the millions upon millions of souls there that would give the person who will get them a phenomenal power. The war then is a war between three people, in the absence of Lucifer and God, the King of Hell, Crowley, the angel Castiel and the Archangel Raphael. The one who will get these Purgatory souls will be the new god. You can imagine the consequences with Crowley (hell on earth and in the universe), Raphael who is the fundamentalist in the angelic family and wants to restart the Apocalypse which has to happen because god has said so, even in his absence, and the small little rank and file angel Castiel who does not want that apocalypse to be reopened and who wants to manage the world and the universe in a gentler way.<br /><br />Before getting to the final battle, the series has to solve some secondary issues.<br /><br />First it has to enable Bobby to recapture his soul from Crowley. That will be difficult since they will have to go to Scotland to dig up the bones of his human identity and menace him to burn them if he does not do what he is asked to do. He will be incited into doing that by the presence of the ghost of his son who has given all kinds of nasty details about his father, which is not surprising in two ways. The son is a fink because the father was a turd, and the father is in hell and has managed to get to the top because he was a metaphorical shark and a metaphorical ghoul and a metaphorical vampire in his real life. The son merely had to give away anything but his father's tomb location, in order for the two Winchesters to get the bones. Of course the Winchetsers and company make the mistake not to keep the bones after Crowley yielded, so that they lost their power over him. Crowley rushed to Scotland to gather his bones and hide them away.<br /><br />In fact the bones will have another episode: Castiel will find them and he will try to get some information about Purgatory and the Mother of All from Crowley along with the Winchesters. Crowley will refuse and Castiel will burn the bones and Crowley. But it will appear later on that at least not all the bones were burnt, if any of them at all since Crowley will survive his burning episode and come back with a vengeance but also with a pact with Castiel. And that is where the plot sickens. Castiel staged up the death of Crowley himself to keep his dealing with him under the table, if not the carpet.<br /><br />Another side line is that of dragons. To kill dragons you have to have a blade that was soaked in the blood of a dragon. To kill a dragon you must already have killed one. The impossible vicious circle. If you want the first wound you may inflict to a dragon is not mortal since so far the blade had not been dipped in dragon's blood. But the second blow, if you have the opportunity to do so, will be deadly. Dean and Sam find such a sword in the home of a San Francisco University professor, Ellie Visyak. It is slightly difficult to get it out of the piece of rock in which it is embedded, but with dynamite, more Nobel than noble, at least if it were not plastic of some kind, Dean manages to get it, or at least a long ands sharp enough piece of it for the job. And the dragons get destroyed.<br /><br />This side story will become essential later.<br /><br />Another side story is the calling of fairies by a clockmaker who has Parkinson's disease. The fairies work for him, drink milk, but they also capture the first born son of any family to serve their king Oberon. Dean is at stake because he is a first born. The shortcoming of fairies is that when they come across a pile of powder sugar they are compelled by their instinct to count the grains. That will enable Dean to remain with us. The ritual will be reversed and the fairies will go back and the clockmaker will retire.<br /><br />Another side story has to do with skinwalkers. Dogs are not that friendly you know. Some of them and more and more are skinwalkers. They can change into men if they want and their target is to multiply as dogs and sooner or later answer the call and take over the humans and then they will be the new human race. Sam and Dean have to clean up a pack of them in a city and that is difficult indeed, but they manage because to do their business these skinwalkers have to be in human form. So one is captured and he is used in human form to bait the others and the plan works so well they are all killed, except the one who was the bait, only wounded in his dog's form and he goes away. That will lead to a very sad moment when he will try to confront the wife and child of the man he had actually killed and they know he had done it.<br /><br />That's now time to come back into the picture of the season. Opening Purgatory.<br /><br />But before it all we have to enter the recapturing of Sam's soul. To make things short, let me say it is Death, contacted by Dean, who will bring that soul back. That will mean a side-story since Dean will have to be Death for 24 hours, and he failed. Death however holds his promise. So Sam has his soul back, in fact only part of this soul: all that happened in the pit has not been erased because it is un-erasable, but has been locked up inside a wall or behind a wall and that wall has to remain intact, otherwise tremendous suffering will happen. Castiel is strictly opposed to that transaction and it reveals that since he brought Sam back, he is the one who decided to bring Sam back without his soul for reasons that are definitely not clear. But Castiel is at times weird in this season and over-empathetic concerning the \\"family\\" that Dean, Sam and Bobby would be to him, as if an angel had and needed to have a family, apart from God who is their fathers and other angels and archangels who are their brothers, and maybe sisters after all since an angel is at least androgyneous. Note angels are soulless too.<br /><br />H.P. Lovecraft provides the track to the key to purgatory. On March 15 1937 with six other believers he performed a ritual to open the door and they succeeded, though no one, except a boy witness knows. One person came out, a monster for sure, we will never know its shape, and the door will close back. This monster will take the form of the boy's mother and this boy's mother is no one else but Ellie Visyak. It is Bobby who discovers the fact and Ellie is a good friend of his. So he warns her that all demonic and angelic forces are running after her. She took the warning too lightly and she got trapped by Castiel.<br /><br />Castiel had an agreement with Crowley. As soon as he gets the blood of a native of purgatory he rejects his pact and Crowley has to run. But he comes back to confront Castiel with Raphael. He had changed his alliance. Raphael at that moment appears as ablack woman. So Castiel goes away. But the jar of blood he had left behind is not Ellie's blood but dog's blood. So Crowley and Raphael perform a rite that does not work.<br /><br />In the mean time Sam had gone down at Bobby's. He is unconscious. In fact we are provided with a story of what is happening to him. He is in a dream in which he has been exploded into three entities, three pieces. The first one that has little memory is the Sam with his soul, in fact he seems to be essentially the soul that death had delivered to him and has lost all memory of before right now and who he was. He is helped by a waitress and he manages to be attacked and confront the second Sam, the Sam without his soul, the Sam that came back from the pit, nothing but the body. He kills that Sam and recuperates his body and physical memory. But the warning is: wait and see till you meet the third one. The third one is his soul as it was burning in the pit, his full soul memory, and that third Sam is killed by the first reunified Sam and the third piece gets into him. He has recaptured his full soul memory and that hurts.<br /><br />This leads us to the end. Dean and Bobby arrive at the place where Castiel and Crowley are supposed to meet. They arrive when the host of spirits arrive with Crowley and Raphael for their vengeance. They crawl out of the car and they witness Crowley and Raphael performing the ritual that fails. Castiel arrives then and reveals that the blood they had used was not the good one and he brings the jar of good blood but the jar is empty. He has performed the ritual and he has the souls. He makes Crowley disappear and he destroys the black lady Raphael. Then a completely deranged Sam arrives from behind and stabs Castiel in the back with no effect.<br /><br />The story is closed there and Castiel says: \\"I am not an angel anymore. I am the new god. You bow down and profess your love or I'll destroy you. You are not my family.\\" All that in spite of all the brotherly love and human empathy and friendship he had expressed to Dean and Sam. It is the underling that captured the supreme power of souls who has become the new god, all powerful, omniscient and ever present in space and time. Who can trust such an underling?<br /><br />I guess the answer is in the next season, the season that is running right now.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVEme of a San Francisco University professor, Ellie Visyak.

B004LWZW9C|4.0|The movie New Year's Eve was for the most part good light entertainment.  Like Valentine's Day before it, there is an impressive ensemble of players and several engaging but ultimately obvious plotlines.  There were no life and death crisis nor was there a huge moral to be learned.  It was what it was - a nice date movie with several happy endings.    Of note: with New Years Eve and Valentines Day, it appears that Hollywood is cashing in on new genre of film; one that uses an impressive genre of stars in supporting roles for multiple plot lines within the film.  This genre is not new as it is reminiscent of the TV shows in the 70s such as Love Boat and Fantasy Island. Not to say its bad... I enjoyed both films and will likely buy New Years Even when it comes out on DVD.  And I look forward to the next instalment, possibly Independence Day without the alien attack.  Basically good fun - a great date movie and nice way to spend a few hours
0786958731|5.0|I will start this review by saying I've never played the Dungeons and Dragons pen-and-paper game.  I am, however, very familiar with D&D and Drizzt.  I've played most of the D&D video games, my favorites being:  The Temple of Elemental Evil, and the Baldur's Gate Series.  I've also read most of the Drizzt books.<br /><br />This game is fantastic in that it perfectly catches Drizzt's adventures from the book and feels very much like a turn based dungeon crawling video game.  I'm very familiar with the D&D rules, even without playing true D&D.  While this game is watered down to the extreme, there is still enough of the essence of the rules for you to know that it is Dungeons and Dragons.<br /><br />On to how fun it is, and BOY IS IT FUN!  There is one single player adventure, and some of the other adventures are easily adapted into single player use.  Single player is not boring, but doesn't give you a grasp of how great this product is.  Multiplayer is where it shines.  There are 40 or so durable miniatures, including a few really big ones, and durable puzzle pieces that build your dungeon, or cavern in this game.  It feels like you are building a puzzle and playing with a big box of toys all at the same time.<br /><br />Jokes come fast and plenty while playing with friends.  This game proves to be just as enjoyable making fun of, as it is playing it.  Encourage your friends to get in character too, which makes the whole thing sillier and even more fun.<br /><br />There are 13 adventures that come with the game.  The adventures last from an hour, to an hour and a half.  Each dungeon is randomly generated because you shuffle items like the dungeon tiles and monster cards everytime you play.  If you go back and use different heroes as well, and there a lot to choose from, this game has considerable replay value.<br /><br />This game really does feel like playing a CRPG.  It proves to be more fun though.  With the interaction of friends, choosing random scenarios, and characters to play through this game proves to be simply PHENOMENAL!<br /><br />I didn't realize that board games could be this fun.  I heartily recommend this to fans of RPGs, fantasy, and board games in general.  Wizard's of the Coast has put forth an unbelievable product that is well worth the buck.simply PHENOMENAL!

B005NQ94KS|1.0|One Day is probably the worst movie I have seen in many years.  I expected so much more from Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgiss.  These cannot be the same actors who played so well in Love and Other Drugs and The Way Back.<br /><br />The primary plot line of the story is an on-going friendship/love between two people who exhibit the worst qualities of Generation X.  As \\"star crossed\\" lovers travel from one empty experience (romance, relationships, jobs) to another, only finding solace in each other's company.  They are meant to be together and yet, something always pulls them apart.  Usually something self-destructive and/or petty.  The young woman finally finds herself as an author and the young man finally crawls down from his narcissist perch to find what they have always needed - each other. So basically I could have written this review without seeing the film.<br /><br />And what's with Anne Hathaway's pool scenes?  I don't get the significance of swimming laps...  Unless of course the director is trying to illustrate the tedium of the heroine's life.  Not that he needed any, the movie was tedious enough without the laps.<br /><br />The requisite tragedy is not a surprise because two people so pathetic could never be happy for very long.  But it's useful because the hero, as pathetic as he is can go deeper, becoming even more pitiful if that's possible. And even in the end, as our hero has his cathartic moment - his own daughter reminds him of the pathetic loser that he is.  As the credits roll we see the hero, smiling gently, knowing that here, in this place, being insulted by his daughter, his ex-wife and the rest of his inner circle, he has found peace. And I went to find a bag to barf in...<br /><br />Basically the whole movie is a huge contest about which one of the main characters is the most pathetic.  Spoiler alert, he wins but only because he's the last one standing.<br /><br />What a waste of time.  I cannot recommend this DVD - wait until it comes out on cable and find something better to do - like wash the car, clean the bathroom, get that root canal done. Anything not to waste another two hours that you cannot get back.wash the car, clean the bathroom, get that root canal done. Anything not to waste another two hours that you cannot get back.
B00475AYJQ|1.0|My thought when I closed this book -- nothing happened.  I assumed after the first book that Kvothe was on a path of revenge against The Seven.  Unfortunately, the author provides 1000 pages of...nothing.  In fact, my only takeaway is that The Seven are still around while Kvothe is dictating his youthful adventures.  Also, current (day 2) Kvothe is broken and weak.  And those two tidbits were found in the last 50 pages.<br /><br />I enjoyed his writing style, but not the book.  Espeacially at $15.  I have read more interesting stories for$.99.<br /><br />Don't buy this book
B004529NLG|1.0|I just got a 3D TV, 3D blu-ray player and a pair of glasses for it and wanted to test out the 3D. This film was the most highly rated in terms of 3D quality that I could see, based on amazon.com reviews. In fact, the 3D is standout in places, but the film itself is atrocious. Suggest avoiding this like the plague - go for one of the animated featured (despicable me, etc.) or a life blu-ray such as one of the iMax features. This is what middle-aged hollywood execs provide for younger people - utterly clueless.

We laugh at the similarities in the book that happen with us in real life as well. Jeff Kinney really excels at bringing<br />real life situations into his books so kids can<br />relate and laugh at their trials in life dealing with<br />school, teachers, friends, parents, siblings, family members and even neighbors.The book arrived on time as promised and in New condition.

B003L77GG0|2.0|If you are looking for the well written, well produced, and well directed episodes from the early years of this acclaimed series you probably won't find it in this loose collection of bizarre fairy tales.<br /><br />This great series, which I anticipated with each new week, has taken a serious tumble in this jumble of nonsensical short stories. Many are rehashes of stories already told (must have run out of new ideas) and very few afford us more than a brief 45 minute glimpse, which ultimately provides the viewer with a shallow, under-developed story that is way too short to provide any depth to the characters or meaning to the story.  Previous years saw running story lines from one episode to the next that provided us with all the information we needed to become immersed in the story line and the characters, but this season seemed to be produced more for quantity and less for quality (courtesy of Mr. Welling who was the executive producer for the entire season).<br /><br />Some of the ideas were just plain dumb,like the episode etitled \\"Granny Goodness\\", who appears as an evil and sinister old lady who is into S&M and keeps a bevy of scantilly clad \\"torture girls who are into martial arts\\".  I know this series is based on a comic book but this is lowering the bar too far.<br /><br />Now for the biggest disappointment! If you, like I, have been watching this series faithfully and anticipating the moment when Clark actully learns to fly, then brace yourself for a quick three seconds of an \\"animated\\" sequence of a small indistinguishable figure zipping through the far horizon.<br /><br />If you are a completist you definitely should purchase the collection, but do so knowing that if you enjoyed the series as much as I did, this season may not meet the high expectations it used to deserve.<br /><br />On a positive note I enjoyed seeing Lex again (the show was never the same after he departed) but even he couldn't measure up to his old evil ways in the few minutes afforded him in the final episode.<br /><br />Great series, very weak final season!

B0027G783W|4.0|Alright, so as an electronic artist with more in mind than getting people to dance, Moby is no stranger to making \\"mood music\\"--you know, using a simple soundscape to evoke an emotion of some sort. We saw him at work with that on \\"Play\\" and \\"18\\", but here, on \\"Wait for Me\\", Moby lays on an atmosphere at Venusian levels of density. The melancholy of this recording is so penetrating and massive that listening to it with headphones is like phasing out and travelling to a dimension made out of pure sadness and regret.   Luckily, although sad, this is not a monotonous place. Some tracks are lush and soulful, like \\"Division\\" and \\"Study War\\" while others are stark and creepy, like the title track with its spooky piano loop, the bluesy \\"Walk With Me\\" and the minute-long old-school ambient electronic instrumental \\"Stock Radio\\". Then there's \\"Mistake\\", which features Moby's fragile-sounding voice sing lines like \\"Oh you've never felt this lost before/And the world is closing doors\\" in this sympathetic way that just about breaks your heart. I can imagine it playing in the background of some indie move scene where a guy is alone in his apartment, having an emotional breakdown.  This mood doesn't let up. And I'm not talking about gloomy, cloudy-day music, either. A lot of these songs have a truly desperate, deeply depressed feel. This is the music that plays in the heads of people who perceive their lives to be falling apart. I will admit that I myself don't listen to this album very often. It is a beautiful piece of work, but something about it actually produces a sense of loneliness and despair in me that is hard to shake afterwards.

B0034G4P9E|5.0|Being part of the SAG (Screen Actors Guild), I get to screen a lot of movies, as I am being sent a plethora of DVD screeners, with 'Warrior' being one of them. Although I have already seen some of the others on the big screen, the 1st DVD I pop in happened to be 'Warrior.' Mind you, I didn't have any expectations nor did I even have a clue what the movie was about. As it started, it seemed like it was going to be a somewhat slow drama, but as the film progressed, I was greatly mistaken. Nick Nolte's performance got me a little teary eyed before we were even into the meat of the story.   This film, the way it was directed, acted, written, and fought was truly exceptional. I have to say that this goes down in one of my all-time favorites list.   Even after watching some of the other competition like 'War Horse,' 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,' 'Coriolanus,' etc..., 'Warrior' is still my favorite of the bunch.   Do I recommend this? Absolutely! 5 STARS! So far I see BEST PICTURE AWARD in this film's future.
B006C45MRE|4.0|This was alot better than I thought it would be from the trailers.  Good action too.  Nice twist to a western.

B005OK722U|4.0|The `Hostel' films are movies that I kinda wish were never made. They touch on death, pain, and solitude in ways you'd rather not think about - on situations you'd really rather not ever find yourself in. However, they're so disturbing in their themes and setpieces that it's kinda like a bad car wreck - you can't help but watch.<br /><br />The first Hostel film was a masterpiece in my opinion - it brilliantly set itself up like a typical mid-2000s teen sex flick, replete with oodles of sex with sensual pop music playing in the backdrop and such, before plunging into the hopeless abyss of pain, misery, solitude, and death, all in a creepy foreign land rife with corruption and lacking law and order.<br /><br />The second film was average with exception to the excellent character study of the two clients, and this third entry comes off as a pretty typical \\"numbered sequel\\"; the characters are pretty paper-thin, some of the setpieces seem recycled, the editing and pacing is super-fast, etc, and these are GREAT things in my opinion for this type of movie. These characteristics define typical horror sequels, and people complaining about them are watching the wrong movie. This wasn't meant to win any awards, but to be a quick trashy watch.<br /><br />Three buddies go to Las Vegas for a pre-marriage bachelor party for their buddy who is getting married the next week. It isn't long before familiar things start to happen, and our valiant heroes are enticed by two escorts to a party far off the strip, where things start to go wrong as one can predict. Most of the violence and disturbance-facotr in this entry is, as some early reviews said, tamer than the prior two entries, with the exception of one particularly nasty torture/death early on which seems to have been cut down seriously from what it could have been., and seems almost out of place compared with the rest of the setpieces.<br /><br />I don't know why I watch these movies - these are things I don't want to think about, and are really negative and depressing. But hell it's the horror genre. A decent entry in the series and a good \\"numbered-sequel type\\" horror film in general.<br /><br />P.S. My favorite character in this movie has to be the (Ukranian?) guy who's in the prisoner cage for most of the movie. He gets some awesome scenes near the end and is a total badass..

B0055SJVPW|5.0|I've read the book and really enjoyed it. When the movie came out I watched it with my sisters, neither of whom has read the book, and we all three LOVED it! Is it ground-breaking? No. Is it high-brow Oscar fare? No. But it's a really fun movie, with characters you can cheer for and a rom-com that's worthy of watching over and over again on those nights when you want something fun and familiar. The male leads are ones that either make you laugh hysterically (fantastic writing for John K's character) or swoon and the female leads are a bit extreme versions of our girlfriends that leave one wishing each would recognize their flaws and rise above them, which of course, they eventually do. A stand-out in the over-crowded line of rom-com DVDs that combines cuteness, humour and love.
0439813786|5.0|All I can say, this is a different way of reading. My son (8 years old), who is not much into reading books, like it so much that he finished in one day. And in the end we all read it and liked it a lot...please more books like that....
B0064BCNA4|1.0|its unresponsive and sounds terrible.  we've been playing for years and is truely the worst I've heard.  don't waste your time.
B003L77GRO|5.0|We loved seasons 1-3 and really got a little bored with season 4.  With so many reviewers saying season 5 was a let down, we were dubious.  Well, we think it's the best season yet.  A lot going on with the cast giving greater performances than ever.  We loved the Julia Stiles character along with the personal dramas of the co-workers and their intertwining relationships and isn't Vince Masuka a great character!  I thought the antagonistic relationship between Jordan and Dexter was much more interesting than that with the Trinity killer.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|This was a lovely film I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I don't want to give details cause I'd feel like I was spoiling it. It has humor, drama, and a bit of action. Watch a trailer on it at least. I REALLY LIKE IT WATCH THIS MOVIEEEE!
B0064BCNA4|5.0|I think this is a great little app, especially for an app of the day. Works on my SG 2.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Nyko Zoom is a complete and utter piece of garbage. Even after applying the plastic protective film to my kinect I scratched my kinect badly. I only found this out after being very frustrated with it even after calibrating it numerous times..... Unsuccessful I took the Zoom off and found the scratches after I removed the film. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
0307269752|2.0|I gave this book a chance because it described places in Europe I've always wanted to go and, frankly, because I'm a European. Another reason...another Swedish author, that wrote \\"Let the Right One In\\". The most amazing vampire story ever written. And I'm attracted to gloomy, snowy, surroundings...But let's not talk about me here.<br /><br />Luckily I was pretty sick when I started this book, so I had patience. (I guess we're still talking about me...I don't mind.) Because I NEEDED to get to page 350 for the book to become interesting, and that is the forensic part of catching the bastard. I enjoyed that part tremendously, although in a few places, the connections were just a bit imposed by the author.<br /><br />Characters - flat. Flat-chested, flat-haired, however you want to take it. One-dimensional. And the flattest of them: Salander. Did she really have to be so stereotypical? And from the frozen emotional depths, she gets as warm as a pancake in just a few lines, with the right guy, wait...two middle-aged guys.<br /><br />All of this on the melodious rattling sound of the chains, all across the book.<br /><br />Usually, a well-written book with a subject like that keeps me up at night, thinking for a little while. But this one made me laugh...Seriously, a serial rapist and killer, followed by his son, who also wanted to rape and kill the investigator? This author has some serious issues...Has anyone checked his basement?! In my humble opinion, you gotta make it a little credible. But again, I've never been to \\"Swedishland\\"!<br /><br />Two things really kept me going: the forensic, all that photography trail...pretty interesting. And the second one, Daniel Craig. Wait, that's the movie...The second one, Susanne Bridge Cafe in Hedestad.
0743487486|5.0|This book has been hugely influential in my family.  I read it several years ago and still keep it's lessons with me.  I have also given it to several other parents and had very positive feedback.
B0041JMT82|5.0|(This review is part of a series of reviews of books in my granny square collection. For these reviews, the # of granny squares refers to the number of patterns for squares that are crocheted in the round, not the total number of patterns in the book.)<br /><br />Summary: An exploration of crochet motifs in geometric shapes, including squares, circles, hexagons, and triangles, with tips for working in the round, joining, and changing colors.  Uses U.S. pattern abbreviations and international stitch symbols.  (This book is also on my list of must-have beginner crochet books.)<br /><br /># of granny squares: 33<br /><br />What I like:<br />The spiral binding allows the book to lay flat so you can read and crochet at the same time.<br />The layout and design are excellent - there is plenty of white space and samples are in striking colors and beautifully photographed.<br />All patterns include both U.S. pattern abbreviations and international stitch symbols.<br />The book opens with a \\"workshop\\" section which includes multiple techniques for starting a motif (sliding loop, slip knot, and chain ring), joining, working with multiple colors, and edgings.  This section includes plenty of text and also some step-by-step photos.  This chapter is something you can skip over and just dive into the patterns, but it includes the types of tips and tricks that can make your work look more polished.<br />While the book includes some classic designs, many of the patterns are different from those you'd find in other collections.  There is a nice range of shapes (even though this review focuses on squares).<br />There is a small section in the back which describes how to form each of the stitches used in the book (even the basics like chains), so it is definitely beginner friendly.<br />There are some graphs included in the back so you can design your own international stitch symbol charts.<br /><br />What I didn't like or what's missing:<br />I'm not a fan of the cutesy 7 page section of illustrated ideas for how to use motifs.  I know, I know, it would be totally unreasonable for Edie to make samples and patterns for the hundreds of project ideas in the illustrations.  It's just, well, I wish she did.<br />While there is an illustrated sample in the back with joins for the non-square motifs (e.g., triangles), a sample might help crocheters visualize these ideas better.  (Again, this is isn't really a problem with the book - more like my wishlist for Beyond the Square Part II!)<br /><br />Type: Spiral bound hardcover book.<br /><br />Overall rating (out of 5 stars): 5n of illustrated ideas for how to use motifs.

B006FLGBGA|3.0|The movie:  Latest in the Planet of the Apes saga... clearly the technology is much better than was available back in the early days when this 'series' of films began.  Once again, Hollywood proves that 1 good film idea deserves to be remade to death, and they did it again, here.  Average storyline, well-executed CGI graphics, thinly acted, though I thought Mr. Franco (the lead) did a pretty good job emoting with the actor in the chimp suit.  I live in California, and it was great seeing the Bay Area in another film other than Dirty Harry, Bullit, or a Rom-Com.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Issues with the Download version Vs. DVD/Blu-Ray which are available in stores now  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The problem with this overall experience, though, was in the delivery, and the delivery pipe (DOWNLOAD) I give only 1 star:  I have a VERY fast (over 29 MBps download) fiber-optic Comcast digital pipeline from Amazon's server to my TV.  So, when I elected to buy this film digitally, I thought I was doing something \\"green\\" and saving about $5 versus what the hard copy on DVD would cost.    I was immediately struck by two shortcomings, once the film had downloaded to my TIVO from Amazon-    First:  The QUALITY of the image was NOT up to snuff.  Grainy and not sharp as one would hope for, not even up to DVD quality, much less Blu-Ray.  This was a major irritant, considering today's technology and the fact that I own a 1080p television which is fully-capable of displaying blu-ray images.  My Sony DVD player automatically upscales DVD's to 1020p lines of vertical resolution, no such luck here though, as the image was playing back from my TIVO.  Second:  NO CLOSED CAPTIONING.  This was the deal-breaker.  I have the hearing of a typical senior- POOR.  Without closed-captions, I miss about 50% or more of what's being said.  Simply playing the movie louder is no help.My ears can't separate out the dialog from the sound effects, particularly because today's film makers have fallen in love with VERY LOUD background (this may be to compensate for weak scripts, yeah?) such as squealing tires, bombs, explosions, gunshots, and music.  The upshot?  Without closed captioning, I might as well watch Heidi.  No telling what the movie was about!  I know about the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) - but apparently this federal law either doesn't apply to downloaded films or else no one at Amazon, Netflix, and other Online broadcast media purveyors has heard of the law.  That's wrong in so many ways.  Since the physical DVD has closed captioning in several different languages, I am buying this film on DVD.  I am writing this with the hope that people with hearing issues give thought to this issue, and of course it wouldn't hurt if at some point the power players in media delivery took online streaming to the level where \\"EVERYONE\\" could enjoy the films, even those who have a hearing problem.  I think it will happen someday, and am aware of the fact that this probably means having double-copies of the given media up on the servers (one with no captions, one with English subtitles) and then there would be those who speak other languages who would have this issue as well.  Update:  Netflix streaming films viewed on your PC do offer a \\"subtitles\\" button - great!  Now, what about when viewing on Television set?  It's easier to do nothing than to address the problem, and thus the issue persists.  Until then, I guess the obvious choice is to avoid downloading and purchase on physical media (DVD/Blu-Ray).
B0001I561E|5.0|The movie arrived early and in pristine condition.  No mess and no drama!  I'd definitely order from this vendor again.
B001NEK2GE|2.0|Purchased this keypad to control functions in a graphics-intensive aircraft within Microsoft Flight Simulator X.  The software I use to control the aircraft's functions in combination with the Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog Throttle Quadrant and Joystick combination is called \\"LINDA\\" and it does not recognize the G13 device because (according to the LINDA programmers) \\"It's a keyboard at it's core and functions differently from a Joystick\\".  Sadly, I am forced to return this to Amazon, and I'm way sad about it.  I had huge hopes that I could skirt buying a physical cockpit console to do things I want to do when flying the simulator.  Overall, this looks like a great product, but doesn't function with the game I intended to use it with.  This product comes with a limited version of World of Warcraft, and does have built-in profiles for several other common PC games (role playing and shooter) - but NOT Microsoft's Flight Simulator X.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|It's based on a true story but of course some liberty is taken to make the movie a little more \\"Hollywood\\" It's a great movie. You'll probably recognize a lot of cast.   I have seen this movie on TV a lot but I hate commercials and I usually ended up missing parts of it so I finally just bought it.
0439023521|4.0|You cheer for Catniss and her family through this exciting and pithily written tale of competition and teen angst.  Great for adults, too!
1451648537|1.0|It is detailed in this book that Steve Jobs said that one of the top three things that he ever did, in his whole life, is doing LSD.  It blows my mind away that anyone would think that doing acid is an important thing to do, let alone that it is important enouph to put in his life story.  I wonder how many kids will be inspired by those lines to do some experimenting of thier own.  How many of their minds will be blown away, also?
0143038419|2.0|Can't like this.  No matter the raves of friends and Oprah, I found the protagonist's gripes petty, reactions unconvincing and explanations too long.  Don't get me wrong, I like some good break-up drama.  I just couldn't sympathize with this one.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very interesting and entertaining story. I couldn't put the book down all weekend. Finished the entire series in one week and loved every book. Now, I'm hoping the movie does the book justice.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I first watched Band of Brothers on TV as the HBO special.  After watching it a couple of times, a friend recorded the entire series and I was able to watch it for a second time, I knew I had to have the movie when they hit the streets.  I didn't care what it cost when it first came out and I bought it immediately.  Even though I still have the original DVD set, in great shape, I could not wait until the Blu Ray copy came out.  I added it to my collection almost as quickly as I bought the first set.<br /><br />I was impressed with the footage, the filming and the actors that played the roles.  I was so glad to see that they used lesser known actors for the most part as it allowed us to focus on the story and not the actors playing the parts.  Damian Lewis was an outstanding choice for MAJ Winters and I thought he did a tremendous job.  Like another reviewer pointed out, we have fewer and fewer WWII vets still around and so this movie gives us a chance to \\"Walk a mile in their shoes\\", so to speak.<br /><br />Each episode gave a quick story of Easy Company as they moved from Georgia, through Normandy, to Bastogne to Germany, where they were until the end of the war. Each episode gives us a feeling for what it was like and tried to show us the hardships they faced.  One of the features I really enjoyed was when the actual members of Easy Company told their story, generally at the beginning of the episode.<br /><br />A great movie and a definite \\"Must Have\\" for any video library.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I just bought the Samsung Galaxy Nexus from verizon and its 4g is amazing. I'm so addicted to the 4g I can't stop using it, however this comes at a huge battery price. While I could get an extended battery and MAYBE get 3 extra hours out of it than my current battery, the weight of the phone will go up and I will still have to carry around extra batteries when the one in the phone dies. With excessive use a battery will only last 4 hours, extended maybe 5-6? During the day I would need at least 1 maybe 2 extra batteries in my wallet.... Seems excessive indeed. Then come home and charge all the batteries again? Painful! When I saw these awesome, compact little chargers I HAD to give them a shot. Recharges 4-6 phones??? HELL YEAH!!! That means I can have the capacity of at least 4 batteries on me at any time. I can charge 2 phones at once If I really needed to (for example the gf's phone or a friends almost dead phone). Anyways all in all pretty useful little device. Costs less than what 2 extra batteries would run me right now and works great... what more can I say... for a price to function ration this little battery charger can't be beat. It fits in the palm of my hand, looks sexy and sleek, and has a tiny led flashlight built in. It's slightly heavy and I wouldn't recommend carrying it in your pocket all day long, unless you have the space.... I don't. I toss it in the car and use it when I need it. Charges my phone to full in a little under 2 hours. Not bad, my car charger is hella slow so this is def another +.
0061733199|5.0|I consider myself a moderate hiker that enjoys the outdoors. Coming from a medical background I believe this book is very informative and educational. It will be very handy to have the knowledge in a situation that I hope I never encounter. Overall, I believe this is and was a very good buy!
B003NX76BM|5.0|I loved this book!!! I am a dog lover and a Nora fan so this book was right up my ally. I wish the capture would of been more detailed but she makes up for that with the other aspects of the story. Definitely recommend this book!
B000002J1M|5.0|Genesis / Foxtrot:  This is not the hit making Genesis; Peter Gabriel leads this Genesis when the group was still a progressive experimental band.  Genesis takes the elements of the old English folk songs and expands them, manipulates them, into the form of progressive art rock.  This is not an album you dance to (unless its ballroom dancing) nor do you `rock out' to this one.  What you get from this album is the enjoyment of beauty.  This is epic music.  This album gets Five Stars.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book. I put off reading it since it was in the kid's section at the book store, but I got obsessed just like everyone else has. It is shocking to me this is marketed for young adult. It is incredibly savage and violent. There is the uplifting moments when Katniss' realizes there are good people around her, despite the terrible fortune they have.
B00000JFV9|5.0|Curtis Mayfield / Superfly - The original Motion Picture Soundtrack written & performed by Curtis Mayfield (2 bonus tracks edition CD): This was the most honest movie soundtrack of the era.  Curtis Mayfield takes the simplistic film and writes an amazing set of songs that dealt with drug dealers, drug users, love and death.  A remarkable album.  Five stars.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|The movie that put Chuck Palahniuk on the map in literature and forced Edward Norton up into the spotlight.  Brad Pitt was, by far, already spotlighted by the late 90s, but Edward Norton had yet to have a role that really put him into America's consciousness.  This movie did it all.  Based off of Chuck's book by the same title, Fight Club is a masterful blend of action, thrill, psychology, romance, comedy, and critique on American consumerism and what it does to those of us that can't seem to break our norms.<br /><br />The narrator, only referred to lightly as Jack, has a problem with insomnia, works at a terrible job, and peppers his life with useless material goods.  All of that comes crashing down when he meets Tyler, played by Brad Pitt.  A suave, cool cat that seems to have an answer for everything, Tyler ushers Jack into a whirlwind of mayhem that all starts with the creation of soap and ends with explosives.  Tyler upsets the established order of life, lives as a minimalist, yet dreams large enough to think about changing the world even though he is, for all intents and purposes, a nobody.  He is about living life and not squandering it, about making a sub-culture of dreams out of the mindless drones of America, and striking fear into an order run by bureaucrats who are more concerned about their money than about the livelihood of the most important thing in life: life itself.<br /><br />A fantastic movie for all who just want to wake up and smell the nitroglycerin.  In Tyler we trust.
B000002GYN|5.0|Eagles (self-titled debut):  This one has four great songs, and most of the rest is just good enough to give this album five stars.  It's not a masterpiece, but it is an old favorite.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|A Swivel Sweeper was purchased over two years ago for our dorm office. Our dorm is a female dorm and hair is everywhere. We have used the Swivel Sweeper in our office daily and had no problems. I gave the Swivel Sweeper 5 stars because it has performed better than expected over time. It gets into tight spaces, corners, and sweeps up all the dirt that would be left behind by a dust pan. However, lately the battery charges and then quickly loose the charge. The rotorary brushes spin freely when lifted off the ground but barely move when put on the floor. I recently cleaned the build-up of hair, this helped a little but the Swivel Sweeper is still not working correctly. I ordered a new Swivel Sweeper, extra batteries, and a spare charger. We also own two G2 Swivel Sweepers and use them in our home and travel trailer, with no problems so far.
B000FZERIG|4.0|George Harrison / Living in the Material World:  This CD has some excellent songs mixed with some merely ok songs.  This album reflects his \\"Krishna\\" philosophy better than any other he had previously released, and he praised the movement just at a time when the American arm of the movement was disintegrating into madness (see  \\"Monkey on a Stick: Murder, Madness, and the Hare Krishnas\\" by  John Hubner and Lindsey Gruson).  George does speak to John and Paul in the title track in a plea to turn from crass commercialism.  The album is actually pretty good, although George sounds rather horse throughout.  It is odd at times only because he is speaking from the viewpoint of the far-east, which is often more than foreign to western ears.  However, that `foreignness' is also one of the interesting aspects of the album.  Four Stars.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I read this book as a teen and re-read it as a middle-aged adult with PTSD.  I know what it is like to be unstuck in time, not being able to keep the past in the past as it comes roaring into the present. When I was a teen I didn't understand when the forward talked about war being fought by babies.  Now I realize that young men and women who fight wars are only babies when it comes to life.  The war dead will never have a chance to become seasoned by the passage of time.  I just had to put it on my Kindle.  This is one book I need for my collection.
B00000DWPH|5.0|Jethro Tull / Thick as a Brick (MFSL gold disc): Being an album of several ideas knitted together into a single track on two sides (for the LP), this is a ponderous yet wonderful experiment from Jethro Tull (and Gerald Bostock).  It works.  It keeps the attention of the audience and it entertains throughout.  The MFSL gold CD reproduces (in minature) the pages of the original LP's `newspaper', although not in the newspaper format (just as a fold out of the booklet).  The sound is at it's best.<br />A five star album.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I know that there are many people disappointed with the last book in this amazingly written trilogy.  I am not one of those people.  Like most people I've known who had the good fortune of picking up The Hunger Games, I have been riveted by the story since the very first chapter.  Its fast pacing has left me on the edge of my seat throughout all three books and I found myself fearing for the fate of Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and all of the citizens of Panem.  In this book, Katniss continues to struggle with her unwanted fame as an icon of the revolution and the rebels begin to assault the Capitol directly--aiming to take down President Snow.  There is finally a resolution to the love triangle (if you can honestly call it that--in my opinion, Katniss is too disinterested in anything other than surviving and protecting her loved ones to worry about Gale vs. Peeta).  Additionally, the tension between the rebels and the capitol comes to a head in an honest portrayal of the grim realities of war.  While some have taken issue with the negative tone of the book, I actually think it is incredibly appropriate.  While war is an agent of change and often a necessary evil, it is not glamorous--it is horrible.  Additionally, Katniss is a hero who never wanted to be a hero.  It is this very reluctance to be in the public eye that makes her who she is.  While Katniss is often emotionally flat and seemingly numb to the world, I would argue that this is a very real portrayal of the PTSD that anyone who had suffered through what she had would experience.  Likewise, I think Peeta and Haymitch are also excellent examples of the toll that PTSD takes on individuals who have lived through tragedies.  So while this book does not end with rainbows and everyone smiling and holding hands, I think the beauty lies in its realism.  It is the raw emotional experience of tragedy and fighting for what is right even what it is not easy.
B004SIP86Q|4.0|First, know this:  \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" is about a murder that shocked New Zealand in the 1950's.  If a film based upon such subject matter is not your cup of tea, I suggest you stop reading right now.  Ok, still with me?  Then let me list the reasons why one might want to see this film:  1)  You are a big Peter Jackson fan, and you'd like to learn more about the films he made before the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy; you'd also like to see why his films made him an excellent choice to helm the \\"LOTR\\".  2)  You are a big Kate Winslet fan, and you'd like to see her in her cinematic debut (her performance here clearly establishes her as a major dramatic talent).  3)  You like very off-beat films about deranged personalities.  4)  You're a film buff, and you're always interested in high-quality films, and based on the reviews here on Amazon, you would like to check this one out.  If your reason for viewing this film isn't articulated above, then don't bother with this one.  This isn't your average Friday night DVD entertainment.    Still interested?  Read on.  I won't explain the plot in this review; if you need a basic overview of the plot, check out some of the other reviews, or read it on wikipedia.    What I will tell you, first and foremost, is that watching this film, you can see how Peter Jackson certainly made a very logical choice to helm the \\"LOTR\\" trilogy.  Why?  His ability to bring us into the minds, the thoughts, and the feelings of deranged, outcast personalities is almost parless.  Only someone who had clearly demonstrated such abilities could be trusted to bring a major character like Gollum to the big screen, and Jackson's intimate protrayal of these two girls, and their murderous machinations towards one of their mothers, is nothing short of amazing.  Why is it amazing?  Because we're taken into these girls' psyches, and there we're shown how both self-centered and obsessed with one another they are.  They do not seem to have any real connection or bond with anyone outside of themselves and their profoundly twisted and dysfunctional relationship.  Yet this film does not demand any particular judgment from us; rather, one gets the impression that this film seeks merely to present us this terrible tragedy, and let us draw from it whatever lessons we can.    Jackson does the same thing in \\"LOTR\\"; we journey into Gollum's split personality, and we find that issues of self-centeredness, obsession, and irrationality abound; yet again, we're not there to judge Gollum (especially since Gandalf doesn't seem to judge him so much as pity him).    The upshot?  Watching \\"Heaven Creatures\\" gives one insight into why Jackson was clearly an excellent choice for \\"LOTR\\"; he can portray obsessed and irrational characters whose interaction with the world outside of themselves veers from the seemingly rational to the clearly irrational.  \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" is indisputable evidence of this.  However ...  While it might have been possible to pity Gollum rather than hate him, it's difficult to be at all sympathetic to Juliet and Gina.  (beware, plot-spoilers follow)  One reviewer here posted that \\"almost in spite of ourselves, (we) are completely in sympathy with their decision (although afterwards, we shake ourselves back into rationality, and wonder why they came to such a desperate conclusion), we accept the racing towards inevitability that they seemed to have felt.\\"  I certainly respect differing perceptions and points of view, but I don't agree that it is inevitable that one will sympathize with the girls' desperation, so much so that a plot to kill Gina's mother begins to seem rational, even if only for a short time.  Rather, what is so successfully protrayed here is the extremely intense and profoundly emotional symbiotic relationship these two teenage girls shared with one another.  The film's exploration of this relationship serves to explain to the viewer the context in which this murder was planned and carried out, illustrating to the viewer the girls' motive.  But I must disagree  that one is inevitably drawn into the girls' emotional world; I, for one, was not.     And why was I not drawn in?  Gina's mother was not evil, not abusive, and very much did not deserve the terrible crime committed against her.  Not that anyone \\"deserves\\" to be bludgeoned to death with a brick; I use the word \\"deserve\\" to illustrate that this film protrays Gina's mother truly as a victim.  While she did not understand her daughter Gina, it can hardly be argued that she somehow brought the girls' murderous plot upon herself.  Her care and concern for Gina was evident throughout the film, even if it was equally evident that she had no idea how to reach her daughter.     This film is very much a tragedy, and as much as the context of this murder is protrayed as a repressive society that doesn't give these young ladies a chance to discover their own, unique identities, neither does this film attempt to excuse or justify the murder these girls commit.  (I, for one, was very surprised by how little time both spent in prison).  So, to sum up, yes, this is a high-quality film; it's well-acted, directed and photographed.  Quality is not the issue; your motive to see it is what comes into play.  As aforementioned, if you are looking into either Peter Jackson's or Kate Winslet's background, or, you like stories about deranged personalities who, in their obsession with one another, seem to both isolate themselves from their surrounding familial and social environments, whilst casting their own twisted judgments upon the same, then, well, this film is for you!  But if you're just looking for some interesting-yet-entertaining Friday night escapism, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.  This is a good film, but if you're not looking for this kind of story, you won't find much to like here.
B005CAAU76|4.0|Queen released this album at the height of their 1970's popularity.  This album followed years of bad reviews of the band from magazines like Rolling Stone and other music critics who never really seemed to understand that Queen did not want to be Led Zeppelin (who also received lack luster reviews from Rolling Stone).  Queen wanted to be different and create their own unique sound and they were not afraid of any criticism they might receive for being so daring in their musical approach.  With the release of Jazz, I truly believe that Queen was finally at the point where their success amongst their fan base spoke louder to them than any writer ever could.  Which is why Queen felt that their bombastic, campy, stylized and over the top approach to music was something to be celebrated regardless of what any critic might think.  It was Queen's way of saying \\"so you don't like the music that so many of our fans love? We'll then, here's some more\\".       This is quite evident on Jazz.       First off, they pissed off many critics because they decided to call the album Jazz even though it has nothing to do with jazz at all.  Neither did the film \\"All That Jazz\\" (which was nominated for Best Picture) but that's another issue.  They then start the \\"Jazz\\" album off with Freddie Mercury's brilliant vocals singing what amounts to some sort of Arabic prayer which suddenly erupts into a funny and strangely captivating song titled \\"Mustapha\\".  It's silly, over the top, and something only Queen would consider.  From there the album then twists and turns through different genres ranging from hard rock tunes (Let Me Entertain You / Dean on Time) to ballads (Jealousy / In Only Seven Days) to arena rock standouts (Fat Bottomed Girls / Bicycle Race) to feel good songs (If You Can't Beat Them / Don't Stop Me Now) all with performed with Queen's unique and uncompromising style.  The album has very few week spots and represents a diverse, fun and eclectic mix of music that only Queen woulddare to attempt.     Anyone who truly \\"gets\\" Queen will love this album and the 2011 re-master is the way to go!       After 30 years of success, perhaps it's time for Rolling Stone to re-review the album and give it its proper rating (like they've done with so many other artists that were a little bit too different or ahead of their time).       And if they refuse, considering the fact that people are still purchasing, listening and enjoying this album today makes me feel pretty confident that Queen had the last laugh on this one.     I can picture the four members of Queen with their middle fingers in the air saying...      \\"Vontap ist ahiln avil ahiln adhim Mustapha, Aleikum Salaam hey!\\"
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This series has a ton of depth to it. Rothfuss goes very slow explaining aspects of the whole world. If you don't like taking the time and understanding how things happen or why things happen I do not suggest this book, I would suggest the series \\"a song of ice and fire\\" better known as the game of thrones series. Both are great series however this The kingkiller chronicle is a lot more detail and more gaps in action. I couldn't put this book or \\"the wise mans fear\\" down. Highly recommend it.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I've heard quite a few people say things along the lines of 'Oh the Chili's have lost their spark, they are no longer funky and fun just mellow and boring'. Well those people certainly have not listened to this album properly and in depth. On the surface there seems to be quite a few slow, melodic songs more than what any Pepper's fan would expect. But the Pepper's definitely still have their spark and this album shows that they can mature within their music as well as keep the funk. This album is the perfect mixture of rapid, funky tunes and beautiful, melodic songs that manage to blend together to create a solid, good quality album.  Here's my opinion on the songs (given in marks out of ten)  Ratings:  10 - Brilliant  1 - Terrible  Disc 1 - Jupiter  Dani California - Fantastic opening song really gets you into the mood for the next songs on the album, catchy riff  8/10  Snow - Melodic driven, laid back tune 7/10  Charlie - Very catchy song, gets stuck in my head very easily but is a great song! 7/10  Stadium Arcadium - Lovely song which really captures the space/mystical atmosphere of the album 7/10  Hump De Bump - Not really into this song, doesn't particularly interest me, still is pretty funky though 4/10  She's only 18 - Average song, I just find it a bit boring 4/10  Slow Cheetah - Beautiful song, John's acoustic guitar playing is very hypnotic 8/10  Torture Me - Good song almost has a threatening vibe to it linking it with the title 7/10  Strip My Mind - I wasn't keen on this song at first but once I listened to it a few times and broke down all the different instruments and discovered parts I hadn't heard before, I have found it to be quite impressive 6/10  Especially in Michigan - Definitely a highlight of the album, a strong song which really gives a good impression to the listener, kickass guitar solo at the end by Frusciante 9/10  Warlocks - Fast, funky tune , very enjoyable 7/10  C'mon Girl - I like it but I think the versus are better than the chorus 6/10  Wet Sand - Best song on the album. Cannot fault this song at all. Magnificent, amazing guitar solo towards the end 10/10  Hey - Chilled, relaxing soft tune. Loved it from the first time I listened to it 8/10  Disc 2 - Mars  Desecration Smile - Great song, makes you want to sing along with it! 7/10  Tell Me Baby - Fun, light hearted song, catchy chorus 8/10  Hard to concentrate - Delicate, mesmerizing love song, really shows how Kiedis' vocals have improved over the years 9/10  21st Century - Lively tune funky bassline courtesy of the wonderful Flea 7/10  She Looks to Me - Enchanting song, infectious melody, another highlight of this album 9/10  Readymade - Brilliant rock song, for the people who said the Peppers were too mellow I direct them to this awesome song 9/10  If - This is quite a slow song, it's inoffensive but I'm not really fond of it 4/10  Make You Feel Better - This song is probably the start of the more Pop sounding songs on the album, nevertheless it's still a pretty good song 7/10  Animal Bar - Quite Poppy, but has some very nice effects used throughout the song 6/10  So Much I - Quick , addictive song, lots of tempo changes but overall very effective 8/10  Storm in A Teacup - Quite Rock sounding, it's good but isn't one of my favourites of the album 5/10  We Believe - Excellent song, creates quite a paranoid sounding atmosphere, good lead up to the chorus 7/10  Turn it Again - Old school funk, with an outstanding guitar solo 9/10  Death of A Martian - Nice choice for a closing song, chorus is pleasant 7/10  I am a big Red Hot Chili Peppers fan and was not disappointed with Stadium Arcadium, I recommend this album.
1612130283|4.0|Ok...so before I started FSG I was totally excited. I mean come on, look at all the great 5 star reviews! Then I started reading it and I wasn't so sure anymore. I thought initially that the writing was a bit amateurish but, I decided that I was gonna forge on because I didn't want to prematurely give up on the book after only 20 pages. The book turned out to be absoF@*$inglutely great once I surrendered to the story and let go of my little pet peeves. I didn't give it a total of 5 stars because I got annoyed with all the references to Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" and all her \\"oh my's\\". I mean honestly! It was to the point that I had to pretend they didn't exist and completely skip over them in order to enjoy the scenes. That said, what I loved about this book was the angst of a relationship unfolding...the doubts, the trust issues, feeling out situations and finding a way to navigate them with the other person. The emails between Ana and Christian were amazing and I felt incredibly authentic... I'll definitely be reading the next two books! I hope you give this book a chance...it's really worth the investment.
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|You wake up, alone, on the floor of a cell - you can't remember why you're there or how you got there. The cell is 14 foot on each side and there is a hatch one each of the four walls and on the floor and ceiling, each leading to another identical cell. You have to find your way out of the complex before you die of thirst, but your way is beset by lethal (and rather gruesome) boobytraps.<br /><br />This is the third (and so far the last) of the Cube series and it acts (apparently) as a prequel to the series. Following from the remake/reimagining \\"Hypercube\\" (much maligned, and in my opinion, unfairly so) Cube Zero returns to the roots of the concept; the cell system is mechanical in design and industrial in its feel. The setting is certainly very atmospheric and eerie and I think that on balance it wins over Hypercube's surgical/sci-fi environment.<br /><br />Despite the familiarity of the setting, this last film differs somewhat from it's predecessors in several ways. Firstly, we are provided with a backstory for the protagonist, Rains and, secondly, a good deal of the film is set outside the cube in the cube control room (and even the outside world) from where the plight of the prisoners is often observed from the perspective of the cube's technicians/controllers. I guess that after two films which never ventured outside the confines of the prison cells, this move was probably inevitable; the questions posed by C1 and C2 could hardly be left unanswered for a third time. Nevertheless, much of the motivation of the cube's designers still remains hidden to a degree.<br /><br />Apart from that, the film follows the same formula as its predecessors, with a few small deviations and it is unsurprising then that exterior becomes the more interesting environment. We discover that the technicians seem to have as little idea of their purpose or origin as their subjects, and similarly little exposure to the outside world. When it is revealed that several of their number have disappeared, they even invent lame excuses to avoid unpalatable questions. Even when a supervisor arrives to take control of a deteriorating situation, all we learn is that there are layer upon layer of management and no answers to be had.<br /><br />Conceptually, this is definitely the strongest of the three films. Far from clarifying the mythos, and therefore breaking the spell, the film adds to the mystery by introducing external influences. The setting is also made all the richer by the introduction of the control room and it appears that the set designers had a lot of fun building the detail and backstory into ths environment - the leaking roof, the banks of filing cabinets, the fish in the coffee perc and the mysterious elevator.<br /><br />The cast is fairly standard cube-fodder and yet again, the more interesting characters are the ones outside the cube: Zachary Bennett and David Huband do a decent job as the Cube technicians, but honorable mention should go to Michael Riley who overacts shamelessly as Jax, the ridiculously sinister and sarcastic supervisor. He plays the role like a parody of a typical Bond baddie and, while some may dislike the overacting, I thought that it added a bit more depth to the scenery.<br /><br />This is, ostensibly, a prequel to Cube 1. I am not entirely convinced that it is obvious that it sits earlier in the canon and I suspect that it is best watched after the first film.nt lame excuses to avoid unpalatable questions.

B0050SYS5A|2.0|Got this because we have limited play space. This does indeed cut down the space you need to be away from the tv. However it does not track very well. Also it amplifies the light around you making it harder to detect you. pass on  this.
B0064BCNA4|1.0|A pathetic program.  Akin to the hello world programs of yore.  Not sure how it could get in the market as a paid program and then make it to the free paid of the day.

B006FLGBGA|5.0|Another prequel. Cool.  I did not expect to come away from this movie with a feeling of sympathy for the race of apes in the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" series.  The first half to 2/3 of this movie is sad and touching. A bit much. A story of intelligence growing at the cost of realization: many humans are selfish, short sighted, and abusive. With intelligence comes revolution. Yet, Caesar, the lead ape, maintains a sense of compassion toward the woe-full humans. Does it insinuate that he may have gained more than just a human level of intelligence?  The movie gives a plausible explanation for the idea of a world run by apes, both the sudden rise of ape intelligence and the sudden decline of human power.  And yet, as the story \\"continues\\" in the original movies, apes become the bad guys and humans the stupid downtrodden underdogs building toward revolution. Yet, at the core of all the movies seems to be the idea that \\"human\\" society can bring many awful atrocities, yet a basis of good continues to survive.  James Franco (who plays Will Rodman) did a good job with his character. You can see the change of attitude as his character develops. And the animation acting of Andy Serkis (Caesar) is impressive and compelling. John Lithgow (Charles Rodman) plays a secondary role quite well, of course.
0307959856|1.0|This book is unbelievably lame. Even more unbelievable is I spent twelve bucks on it based on a glowing New York Times book review. It certainly doesn't do any kind of justice to Jane Austen, and it's not even a decent mystery. I wish I'd kept my twelve bucks.

B004RJMUJO|2.0|Game us fun and very well executed.    Main issue is that the iPhone and free android version have a newer version number with more unlockables...  And really, adding the challenges of the unlockables and feint achievements is what keeps repetitively slicing fruit enjoyable.   Its not a technical issue, since the free version has more functionality.  The ads are noticable in the free version, but I've seen worse (free angry birds ads can affect game play).  Why does the paid app have less stuff???

B004HW7JMO|4.0|Despite the title, Spartacus is nowhere to be seen in Gods of the Arena, a prequel season to [[ASIN:B003PIUBZS Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]. The non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma which ultimately claimed the life of title character Andy Whitfield necessitated this season, which served as a filler between the first season and the third - Spartacus: Vengance - with Liam McIntyre re-cast in the leading role.<br /><br />Gods of the Arena deals with behind the scenes intrigue as Quintus Lentulus Batiatus attempts to emerge from his father's shadow and secure a higher position for the house of Batiatus in the Roman city of Capua.  Of course, the historical events portrayed in both seasons of Spartacus are used as a springboard to propel the story, and are only peripherally linked to the real-life events that lead to Spartacus' revolt in 73BC.<br /><br />John Hannah and Lucy Lawless clearly relish their roles here, chewing on every scene of dialog as if it's their last meal.  The supporting performances are also suitably hammy and over the top - sublety has little place here - although Jeffrey Thomas brings suitable gravitas to his role as Titus, Quintus Lentulus' father.<br /><br />The show is filmed in a heightened visual style reminiscent of graphic novels, with some of the backgrounds looking painted rather than organic.  Much has been made of the copious nudity in the series.  While there is plenty of flesh to be seen here, both male and female, it is considerably less, um \\"in your face\\" in season two.  The fleshly attraction here is in watching it abused in the fight scenes, complete with Matrix-style slow motion and CGI injuries of all sorts, including impalement and dismemberment.<br /><br />As history, this is on a level somewhere below, say, [[ASIN:B002M2Z3BA Gone with the Wind]] and [[ASIN:B000ANVQ0K Titanic]].  As pure guilty pleasure entertainment, it holds the viewer's attention.

B001M3LG84|1.0|I ordered 3 copies of the NTSC version for my mom and her friends because all live in the U.S.. All 3 received the PAL version which does not work on DVD players in this country. Customer service had a hard time comprehending the difference so it took 3 calls to get someone who understood and authorized a refund. He helped me re-order the last 2 copies of the NTSC version and was nice enough to offer free shipping. The two replacement DVDs arrived yesterday. SURPRISE !!! PAL versions again even though I was assured that this would not happen again. So now I have to send back five DVDs. I called customer service and the lady was not very knowledgeable about the different formats. After explaining it several times I asked to speak to a supervisor. After waiting for quite a while on hold the same rep came back online and said I should return the DVDs for a refund. She messed up the return label to authorize only one DVD return. Today I sent back two of them and corrected the paperwork myself. I expected that Amazon would offer some kind of a voucher for a future purchase or a free shipping on future purchases but customer service would not do that. I spent a \\"significant\\" amount of money on Amazon this year, about $600 just in November, and I expected much better service. Now I have to find replacement gifts for Christmas and spend a lot more on shipping.

Now, the fact that the world view in The Secret & The Power is nauseatingly reprehensible does not mean they do not work. After all, maybe the forces of the Universe really is geared towards the self-realization of bored middle class women. Maybe tsunamis, famines, diseases, environmental destruction and the multitude of problems facing someone growing up in the Congo results from masses of negative thoughts? After all, the slums of Dehli looks like they might be the site for a lot of negative thinking, and who am I to say what is cause and what is effect?   But I do not think so.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|This is a 1994 concert of my favorite group from my old college days (late 70's).  They are still great musicians.  I also purchased their Farwell Tour from 2005, and both of these are great presentations from great artists.  This is real music(not syntesized as so many Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga current performers use)but real guitar, real voices. I think old and young will enjoy the Eagles.

B005OK725M|5.0|Criticism of this movie will come in very technical terms (lack of believability, incoherent plot, etc). This is just plain ole fun. It most closely resembles 'SALT' minus the big budget. Nonetheless, its a kick a$$ revenge fantasy with its own charm,with violence that isn't too graphic. This makes a great gift for movie buffs who don't wanna think too much, but want to just drop some popcorn as they howl at the screen. ZOE SALDANA has never looked better.

She likes this better than other books that I've bought her that are prettier and more interesting.... not really potty training yet, but maybe this will get her thinking.  I've had it about a month and she still likes to read it :)

This book is a series of reports from his finance disaster tourism.<br /><br />Between 2001 and 2008, worldwide debts, public and private, soared from $84 trillion to $195 trillion. But the peoples of Europe are being made to carry all the costs.<br /><br />By 2008, Ireland had debts that were 25 times its annual tax revenues, Spain and France's debts were ten times their annual tax revenues. Iceland's banking assets grew to $140 billion by 2007, 35 times its GDP.<br /><br />Merrill Lynch, the Bank of America's wealth management division, said, \\"all of the Irish banks are profitable and well-capitalised.\\" They were `fundamentally sound'.  For this six-page lie, Merrill Lynch got a seven million euro fee.<br /><br />Between 2007 and 2010, Irish banks borrowed 97 billion euros from the European Central Bank to repay their bondholders. The Irish government lied that Irish savings banks owned the bonds, but the real bondholders were German and French banks, German investment funds and - Goldman Sachs. The Irish government lied that it was doing this to save Ireland's savers, but its decision meant that Irish savers were saving speculators.<br /><br />In 2001, the Greek government's deficit was 15 per cent of its GDP, not the 3 per cent required to join the euro. So Goldman Sachs fixed it, for a fee of $300 million.<br /><br />Lewis writes of the Greek people, \\"Trapped by an artificially strong currency, they cannot turn these deficits into surpluses, even if they do everything outsiders want them to do. Their exports, priced in euros, remain expensive. The German government wants the Greeks to slash the size of their government, but that will also slow economic growth and reduce tax revenues.\\" This is true of all the euro's members.<br /><br />But overall, Lewis blames the peoples. The Icelanders? Their berserker Viking heritage is to blame. The Greeks? They were all on the take. The Irish? They wanted to stop being Irish.<br /><br />Lewis proffers only a self-righteous and pathetically simple `moral' solution. Telling people that they should be different is no solution at all. He mirrors the EU mantra, that national characteristics are the problem, that we should all become European.<br /><br />Lewis evades seeing that in each country the capitalist class is exploiting the crisis to exploit the working class even more.

B001E45XT4|4.0|Well im not gonna be just saying good stuff about things here but also the most important key points for buying a headset. Firstly i bought this last week and decided to give it a go considering its price and reviews i've seen for it. Of course, the comments do persuade part of my decision to get it a little but nonetheless i decided on it based on my own gamble.   Firstly i decided to get this because the first thing i wanted to get this headset was for its closed ear build. If you dont like a headphone to go over your head but instead around the back of your head, dont get this. this is a mighty bulky headphones. You'll get a massive feeling of something grasping your head when you first put it on. From the pictures seen online and how people use it, i must say i thought it was smaller in size but IT IS HUGE. A few things to note too is that it really grips your head well and the ear muffs are not really gonna cover the whole of your ears. Its not built that way. I suppose plantronics might wanna come up with a new model where the muffs arent squarish but rather rectangular to fit the whole ear in it. Try googling Logitech G35 Headset and you'll know what i mean. Even though i've tried many ways to fit my whole ear in it, i still end up with part of my ear lobes sticking out, and this is a problem after long hours of gaming as it will hurt once you start removing the headset. Im a heavy gamer who plays games for some long hours (6 hrs min and i wear glasses and this is an issue as the muff pads will squeeze the bottom part of my ears to the glasses frame. If you dont wear glasses like me, i suppose it wont hurt so much. Some reviews explains that its comfortable and soft. Yes it is soft, but its not really comfortable since the muffs kinda squeeze your excess earlobes a little so you might want to consider the \\"comfortable\\" portion when buying this. The headset frame is adjustable to give you that required adjustments to fit your head size, be it big or small. Thematerial of the muffs are pretty good,and because its soft, it actually tries to fit your skull structure which is good.  Now we come to the sound and mic. BASS is awesome. I'd say im impressed with the bass for this one considering its only a basic headset. You could hear very detailed bass echoes and crystal clear trebles with this one, and im really impressed. I play games which require voice chat and its so clear that you could tell if other players had bad mic on their headsets cause of their scratchy voices. Oh and did i mention its noise cancellation for the mic? Oh my Gawd! Its so good. Tested on Skype's Echo test and boy was i surprised. It sounded like i was in a recording studio! Its so clear and you dont have to speak loud to be heard. To get the best out of the sound and mic, AMP up the sound settings in your system and you'll hear a major difference. Its so good, its wicked. I have a Logitech G330 Gaming headset and i love the mic on that because of the crystal clear sound you get from it, and this i must say is 90% on par with that. Not that im saying its not good enough, but if you own both of them, you'll know what i mean. The mic tucks in neatly on the side and makes part of the headset frame when not in use so you could also treat this like a normal headphone when you go out without having people staring at you if you had a headset with a mic jutting out on one side of your muffs. It has a 3.5mm jack so it fits to most of your devices. If you plan to use it on your mic xbox controllers or ps3 sets, you'd need to get them special adapters to fit these in. The down side to it is although you could use it, the sounds kinda soft and you sound pretty soft as well so you might wanna speak up a little when doing this.   Side tracking a little, if you're thinking wearing these will block out all the noises from the background, well.. sadly it doesnt. I could still hear when someone talks (on a normal speaking tone) to me even when i wear the headset, soits kinda has its pros and cons. But tbh a little bit of volume increase will solve this problem.   So overall i'd say i'd give this headset a 7.5 out of 10 rating since the quality of build compared to its quality of sound and mic is great. Would i recommend all of you to get it? Sure do! :) Have a little fun, get one, and see for yourself if its great. I wont promise you'd be so gawdfully jawdropped by its performance (i know i did), but i can promise you'd smile for a whole 2 hr while you watch your favourite movie on the computer. Its a cool bling to have, and that GAMECOM label on the headset frame will turn heads on you when you're taking the train or bus, trust me. Enjoy the set!

B004XWLN20|5.0|I got this on Monday the 5th of December. I have sat through a marathon of epic-ness it took me 2 weeks to get through all 189 hours. And it hasn't disappointed me.. Smallville is one of those shows that will definitely leave u screwed to the tv screen.. Tom welling has done a superb job of bringing the backbone to the hero we all know. Even if you have all 10 seasons on DVD it's still worth getting the special features are really great. The display that they have put all 62 discs in is really good for storage size and for protection.. The daily planet newspaper that was featured in the 200th episode is a real good read with great articles.. There is a reason why this show went for 10 years and after watching all the episodes it is clear to see.. Action adventure, drama romance and some quirky humor really redefine a great hero...

1400032717|5.0|I've read Mark Haddon's \\"The Curious Incident of the Do in the Night-time\\" in its entirety about...four times.  Each time, I find that I find new and spectacular about it (most recently, that nothing, save for the Boston Globe review at the bottom, is capitalized on the cover page).  It's that type of attention to detail that makes this book a fabulous read.  What also makes this book particular great, is the realistic, but sensitive portrayal of a deeply, socially troubled child.  Autism (and other such pervasive developmental disorders) are too frequently portrayed in a lighthearted and humorous manner.  For many people, it's a trivialized concept.  When many young people think of autism, they imagine someone who is quirky and awkward, yet lovable because of those facts.  And as sweet as these portrayals might , they're hardly true for those whose loved ones are actually autistic.  It's trying, it takes hard work and a lot of times, not because of anybody's fault, someone messes up and feelings are deeply damaged.  In Haddon's book, Christopher's relationship with his father, and the trials and tribulations that come with it, are a wonderful representation of what that relationship must be like.  That type of visibility for real people with real feelings is necessary, especially with the flood of the lighthearted and fun, but deeply tokenized characters seen in today's films, shows and books.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|A few other reviews have mentioned it, but this book is not an original work. It's gripping, and extremely enjoyable to read, but most of the credit must go to Koushum Takami, the author of the 1999 novel Battle Royale [...] from which this novel is blatantly plagiarized. Battle Royale was translated into 8 languages and adapted into a manga and a movie, so how Collins thought nobody would notice I can't say.

B004132HZS|5.0|I simply found this series to be one of the few gems on TV, and am sad that only 3 episodes were made.  It's a wonderful take on the Sherlock Holmes character, and with the modern setting the ability of  Sherlock to use every modern gadget makes this very watchable.  Love so much about it, like how  they deal with Sherlock's inability to smoke a pipe in the modern \\"smoke-free\\" Britain.  I could  go on and on and on.  Just clever and very very watchable!
B0060AY6FO|2.0|Death at Pemberley takes a mostly-straightforward tour through the lead-up to, discovery and investigation of, and one man's trial for a murder occuring on the Darcy estate, ending with revelations of the motivations and an explanation, if we believe it, of the full affair.  Jane, Lizzie, Lydia, and their husbands, now several years into wedded life, are all involved, and other Austen characters make cameo appearances.  Unfortunately, all the happy families are boring and the unhappy ones are predictable.  Elizabeth Darcy doesn't sparkle, tease her husband, satirize the proceedings, or make mistakes of any kind.  Jane barely speaks, not even to make excuses for anybody.  Darcy, in parts of the story told from his point of view, is discovered to be morose and almost fretful.  The mystery is also frustrating.  There's no detective trying to discover the truth, so we follow the ordinary proceedings of early 19th century criminal investigation and trial, which James covers in detail.  This means we're limited to the questions an unimaginative magistrate asks and to only the answers people are willing to give in court for much of the book.  Many of the events are apparently unseemly for a gentlewoman to attend, and so we don't get the benefit of Mrs. Darcy's take, but she doesn't seem to have special insight anyway--and let's face it, asking questions was never Prejudice's strong suit.  Why not plump a murder on Emma Knightley's doorstep, who I'm sure could not resist meddling, instead, or create new characters and stamp them with the distinguishing Jamesian brush?  I can't help compare this to [[ASIN:0061043516 Busman's Honeymoon]] and wonder if James was trying for something like that or trying to avoid comparisons.  It's a better mystery, and the newly married couple negotiating their new life together make more interesting subjects than this book's mostly very comfortable, satisfied, families.  I love P.D. James, but this is just not good.
0439023513|5.0|First off, if you want perfect, happy endings, go watch a rom-com. What impressed me about the books is that for a so-called young adult audience the idea of loss, and how life changes us (not always for the better) was surprisingly realistic. The first and last books in the series are strongest, and although I think there are some things at the end that could have been drawn out a bit more, we are always seeing things from Katniss's perspective, so can't blame the author too much that there's a certain deus ex machina feelings at times. When you're a pawn, this is how life must feel.
1451627289|5.0|( I will try to speak generally so that I don't spoil your first read!)<br /><br />Every time King comes out with a new novel I am so excited to be immersed in the world he creates!  You can almost guarantee it will at least partly take place in some small town in Maine and is often filled with a huge cast of colorful characters. (In this he doesn't disappoint)<br /><br />I loved this book!  At one point the book wanders into the lives and a Small town from one of Stephen Kings most masterful works.  I felt excited that King found a way to bring more life to one of his best stories as a plot development tool for his new book.<br /><br />Kings typically dark view of small town life- its people, and government, has been been rich fodder for so many stories.  He continues this tradition in several examples but does something new.  One of the towns in the story is just plain good!  It's not overdone in a Stepford Wives sort of way, it's just good folks in a good place.  Several of the characters are very endearing.<br /><br />I didn't read this book expecting historical accuracy.  It's a story!<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />King captured me as a reader and thoroughly entertained me from start to finish.  Fans should really enjoy this latest installment in Kings vast library.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. King for another amazing story!
0071762345|5.0|This book is a great handbook on Social Media and its lessons are applicable to Business as well as Non-Profit institutions and higher education. I'm not a fan of the description the book gives itself \\"How to delight your customers, create an irresistible brand, and be generally amazing on Facebook\\" - because what it does is much less hokey. Kerpen shows how you can do more than just delight customers and make them allies, how to do more than create an irresistible brand and make it an influential brand, and how to do more than be generally amazing and be expert in key Social Media platforms.   The book is dense; unlike its peers, which fill a lot of pages with basic fluff, Likeable Social Media the book aggregates advice, case studies (both negative and positive), and even questions for the reader that really cause change for good marketing. Kerpen explains how to be authentic, how to listen, how to deal with negative comments, how to be honest and transparent, and how to inspire your customers/constituents/prospects/etc.   My favorite part is the DND Rule ('Do Not Delete' - pg. 77). What I took from this small section on the topic is that when negative comments are written, don't just delete them. Instead, this is your opportunity to show how calm, responsive, reasonable, kind, and fair your organization is. You get the chance to show that publicly  in your response to that public negative comment. A negative comment becomes a positive opportunity for your organization. Dave, I have a good case study on this.   Conclusion: Be careful what books you buy on the topic of Social Media. There are some bad ones out there. But I know you'll get some great wisdom from this one. It goes beyond the basics to set some guidelines for effective online engagement.

1439110123|3.0|Anyone who cannot remember the price of gasoline ever being below $2/gallon has probably lived in a time when the Middle East was always considered an area of immense wealth and power. It might be hard to imagine, but it was not that long ago when Middle East oil producing states were some of the poorest in the world. In fact, as late as WWII, the United States was the top oil producer in the world, which helped not only its own development but also single handedly helped the Allies win what was supposed to be the final world war. The history of oil and the impact it has had in the world in every way, from politics, to country conflicts, to corporate structures is profound. The Prize by Daniel Yergin is a comprehensive story of how oil became more than just a commodity, oil has and continues to change the course of civilization.

B003VR5PPY|3.0|In this game for the DS you're going to play the part of Junpei a youngster who gets attacked and finds himself trapped on a boat along with eight other people. Each of these people have a story to tell, and you'll get to hear all about it through the game. Each character will have a bracelet attached to them with a corresponding number. You're going to need to use the numbers in combinations of 3 or 5 to unlock doors within the game. You'll also only have nine game hours (not actual playing time) to get through the game and save yourself.<br /><br />Graphically this game has the flavor of a Japanese game. You can tell the anime influence in the character designs. I do have to say that I enjoyed how every character had a unique wardrobe and an overall different structure to them. The areas that you're going to get to explore definitely have a Titanic feel to them, and once you play the game you'll see exactly how close that feeling is.<br /><br />The sounds of the game aren't too complex but they come enough that it reminds you there is sound in the game.<br /><br />With the game basically being a puzzle adventure game the controls can be as simple as using the stylus, or you can utilize the other controls to get certain things done, but you're still going to need to use the stylus.<br /><br />I have to say that I was excited to play this game, I'm a big puzzle fan, and with the back of the box promising me a large variety of puzzles I couldn't wait to dig in. I quickly found that this was going to be a game that requires a boat load of time. It wasn't because of the amount of puzzles, but of the pacing of the game. The pace is snail like. If this could be found in a novel format, you might get more enjoyment out of it. I'm not saying that it is a bad game, but you're going to be spending the vast majority of the time dealing with dialog, history lessons, and even more reading. One of the big things about this game is that there's multiple endings depending on your decisions in the game. My issue is that I just can't get over the amount of reading you have to get done between actually getting to play the game. If it were cut scenes I think I could give the game more slack as I could passively let the story unfold, but having to tap on the screen or press a button constantly to advance the text on the screen becomes too much of an not so enjoyable chore.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good puzzle game with plenty of dialog to all you to feel the pain and anguish of the characters as well as their body language, then this is the game for you, but if you're looking for a puzzle game with a good variety of puzzles that you can pick up and put down and feel like you advanced the game, this is not the game for you.

B0029LHWJK|5.0|Africa has never been a stranger to horrible human rights violation, but in the late 1880s, King Leopold of Belgium brought forth a level of bloodshed and cruelty rarely seen before or since. He enslaved virtually an entire country, pillaged their natural resources and building a wealth scarcely imaginable. All this was done in the name of progress and building civilizations. These acts set the stage for some of the hate and anger that those in Africa still feel today towards Europe or the west in general. To not understand their past is to not understand their heritage which will never allow us to fully appreciate their view of the west. A powerful read by Adam Hochschild, a story that should be read by all, as Africa is still a troubled area with anarchy and piracy in a few areas which is reeking havoc in shipping lanes and other countries.  My full review of this book is located on my blog which is linked in the very first comment located below.  THank you

0525423656|4.0|Cassia and her family have fallen out of the Society's good graces. Cassia has been placed in a work camp in the Outer Provinces and her family has been relocated. At the camp, Cassia bides her time as she waits for the opportune moment to escape and go after Ky, who has been taken to the border with other male Aberrations to act as decoys for the Enemy. The boys are sitting ducks and their purpose is to die.<br /><br />When Cassia finally gets word of Ky, it is only to find out that he has escaped, but at least he left clues as to where he went. Her days in the wild make her more confident in choosing Ky, but the game is not over for Xander, who may be more like Ky than Cassia thinks.<br /><br />The story of Matched has evolved into something with more depth and dimension with the addition of Crossed. Ally Condie introduces new characters who may or may not have ulterior motives and reveals hidden depths in the main cast of characters of Cassia, Ky, and Xander, especially by adding Ky's voice to the narrative. Matched was Cassia's story, but Crossed is as much of Ky's story as it is hers. Their lives are intertwined.  I wonder (read: hope) if Xander's voice will be added to the third and final installment. The reader needs to know his story in his own words and it would add to the continuity of the work as a whole.<br /><br />The mood has also evolved between the two books into something more mature and serious. There is no Society to make decisions for Cassia and she gets a thorough taste of the death and destruction in Ky's world and the underbelly of the Society.<br /><br />Google \\"The Musings of ALMYBNENR\\" to see this review in full in its original format and to follow my book review blog.
B000RZGIQ8|1.0|I know alot of people are upgrading their dvd collection to blu ray. However, that being said, most people only upgrade if the upgrade is worthy. Well this is one of those that are NOT worthy. My DVD version upgraded to HD looks the same. Come on Paramount, get in gear and give us a totally new remastered version for Blu Ray.  The picture looks the same as it did when I used to watch this on a 19\\" inch TV in the late 80's on a rented VHS tape. Paramount should be ashamed, this is not even close to 720 let alone 1080. I have old DVD's that offer a better picture in the bluray player then this. Yes it does have a cool menu but the picture is NOT high-Def and the sound is only acceptable when you put the setting on 6.1 DTS Master (only reason I gave 1-star). If you do not have a good external speaker system do not waste your money because the picture and the sound won't be worth it.
B005WMADYE|5.0|Going against modern conventions of animation, Redline was created using hand-drawn sketches - over 100,000 of them - rather than computer graphics. The result is a film of gorgeous style, setting, colour and visual complexity. The extraordinary level of detail isn't restricted to the visuals; every sound has been painstakingly mapped onto the film, while the backing soundtrack (which sounds like a Japanese version of Ministry's 'Psalm 69') was custom-created for the scenes, ensuring that the music always fits the action.  The story centres around Redline, a once-every-five-years racing event with no rules except the winner being first one across the finish line. Most vehicles are heavily armed (à la Mad Max or Death Race 2000), but the main protagonist - an adrenaline-junkie racer named JP - refuses to carry weapons, instead insisting that he has the talent to win on speed alone. JP's pacifist attitude has earned him the outstanding nickname of the Very Sweet Weaponless Prince. Visually, JP is a likeable anime hybrid of John Travolta in Grease crossed with James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause. His friendship with (wonderfully named) fellow racer Cherry Boy Hunter Sonoshee McLaren, develops into a love interest which runs parallel to the main story of the race. On the surface, Redline is a high-octane, heavily stylised mixture of the movies Death Race 2000 and Mad Max, the cartoon Wacky Races, and the computer games Total Wipeout and Unreal Tournament. Look deeper than the high-speed races across sweeping vistas and rocky mesas, however, and you'll find more going on. There's a backdrop of military tyranny that parallels our modern world, with corrupt forces masquerading as the 'good guys' while attempting to silence the voices of freedom. Additionally, a Cinderella story develops between Sonoshee and JP. When Sonoshee drops an earring, JP mounts his supersonic motorcycle and goes for a midnight ride, just to leave the earring and some flowers on Sonoshee's doorstep. The futuristic race is simply the context against which the plot is set. The real theme of the film is a timeless one: love and friendship can conquer all.  Redline is a meticulously crafted work of art. It has both style and substance. Rich in allegorical elements and moral themes, the film is a masterwork of anime.  Viewers can have additional fun by comparing the English voice-over with the subtitles (which seem to be direct translations of the original Japanese). The differences are sometimes considerable and often amusing.
1419702238|5.0|I bought this for my ten year old who has read all in the series multiple times.  She loves it and when going to a playgroup, the kids were grabbing it out of her hands as she was the first to get it.
0060873027|5.0|I was very happy when I saw that Richard Preston wrote Michaels novel to finish, sadly post mortem.  And I think he did a swell job!  Since \\"Jurassic Park\\", there wasn`t a Crichton this adventurous, this swashbuckling.  The fact that it was written by two authors, is clearly noticable if you know Circhtons bibliography.  People die all of a sudden and in general there are quite a few unpredictable turns in the plot.  Not that Michael Crichton wasn`t capable of constructing the unpredictable, he just did it in another way.  The combination of the two different styles is very well accomplished and deliveres a fun thrillride of a book.  Another aspect which makes this book unique is that it dares to be naiv in it`s storyline, in being adventuresome and entertaining   and also contain Crichtons vintage way of combining highly complex technical issues with amazingly suspenseful thriller writing.  Even though it can probably be counted as one of Crichtons novels, which are not really suitable for a motion picture adaption  and work better on the page than on screen (like \\"Congo\\"), it is nevertheless a great novel with a lot of suspense and, as all his works, very instructive.  As Richard Preston totaly correct stated in this book: \\"Don`t forget Michael Crichton\\"!!!

030788743X|5.0|Ready Player One can best be described as nerd crack.  It joins the ranks of a growing sub genre of books featuring an MMO (Massive Multiplayer Online) game as its main construct.  If you like anything about video games, the `80s, `80s music, `80s movies, computers, science fiction, dystopian futures, nerdy references, you will love this book . . . if you like all of these things - like I do - this book will become your bible.    In the not-too-distant future, the world is quickly going to hell in a hand basket.  It's very much a dystopian world, but within this gloomy, depressing place is an MMO that just about everyone plays.  OASIS is not just a game, but a way a life for most, where you can have fun, meet friends, got to school, and pretty much lead a full and entertaining life under the guise of your anonymous avatar (whose façade is of your choosing).  Depending on what people can afford, the experience can be fully sensory so that players feel as if they are actually existing in the world of OASIS and experiencing it in just about every way possible.    James Halliday, who grew up in the 1980's when computers were beginning to take off, quickly became addicted to video games and then began making his own.  He is the creator of OASIS, which has gone from a game to life and reality for so many people in this world, and he is many times a billionaire.  When he dies, he activates his will which states that whoever finds the three keys and solves the puzzles will be entitled to his entire fortune.  Wade Watts is an eighteen year old nerd who has hopes of finding all three keys and gaining those untold riches.  His parents are dead and he lives with an aunt who treats him terribly and he cares little for her, scraping by in abject poverty.  And now he thinks he might've just found the location of the first key.    Cline has written a book that just about any sort of nerd (whether they're honest about it or not) will quickly get sucked into and not want to let go.Not only is it like playing a video game or watching your favorite movie, but Ready Player One is literally filled with references and anecdotes and stories of the time period that Cline clearly holds close to his heart.    From the man who brought you the cult-hit movie Fanboys, comes a nerdy book featuring a nerdy story with nerdy characters set in a nerdy world that nerds will absolutely love!

B005I6EU48|4.0|I was a little hesitant in buying this, mostly because it cost 20% of the cost of the Fire, but there were a few reviewers that REALLY liked it, and so I took the plunge. Gotta say, it was the right call. The cover that came in the mail yesterday is in perfect shape, without any marring or warped sides. It literally looks like a classic book, with a gold border and embossed design on the front. It does look like the gold paint will come off, and there is no place to store a stylus, so for that, I will take away one star. Some reviewers swear this is not made for the Fire, but I can assure you that it is. In fact, the Fire fits very snugly in the elastic straps that hold the device. These are well made, and have a rubberized back for better grip. On the inside of the cover there is black felt, which closes onto the Fire screen. I am quite satisfied with this purchase, and heartily recommend it for all you Kindle Fire owners.
0375704027|4.0|Norwegian Wood is the book that launched Japanese author Haruki Murakami from a mid-list author to international stardom and bestsellerdom, not just in his native Japan, but throughout the world.  With its unique combination of western world references and influences combined with the story of growing up in Japan, its success forced the author to leave Japan and live in Europe for some time.  It can best be summed up as Murakami's Catcher in the Rye for Japan.    Norwegian Wood is a change from Murakami's more well-known and expected dark and mysterious novels - usually involving some form of magical realism - featuring a down-to-earth story with some very unusual and special characters.  Toro is working his way through college, growing up in the late sixties, and Murakami seems to pulling a little from his own college years here, with the interesting details about Toro's strange and overly-neat roommate, along with the growing animosity of the students on campus.  Toro's closest friend killed himself when he was a teenager, and now his late best friend's girlfriend - Naoko - has come back into his life.  As they meet and discuss and deal with the loss, their relationship grows and develops, yet Naoko is still having a very hard time dealing with what happened to her psychologically, as well as dealing with the world.    Told from Toro's first-person perspective, it seems that Toro is the only grounded, \\"normal\\" person in the book.  But as the reader gets further along, they realize that Toro has his own problems and issues that he has been hiding.  Then there are his few strange friends, who would certainly not be considered normal by any means, not to mention the eccentric girls he meets up with; some he befriends, others he never sees again.    Norwegian Wood is about a boy becoming a man during the sixties in Japan, educating himself through college, and learning about love and life through relationships and choices.  It is an entertaining and moving story thatalso has a number of life lessons hidden within its pages.    Originally written on November 20, 2011 ©Alex C. Telander.

B004EPYZOO|1.0|My husband rented this movie earlier this year. My daughter and left because it was so bad. I never thought Nicolas Cage could do such a bad move. DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app. You can choose from many different versions of the Gospel and also have it read to you by an audio recording. The speaker is amazing in reading to and conveys the emotions of the Bible effortlessly. You can find live church events and even donate if you want. By far the best Bible app for the kindle fire!
B000ATQYT2|4.0|This is a movie that as a child I would watch during the holiday season! It has always been a favorite of mine and my families. I am so glad I could buy it for myself.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Michelle Williams paints a soul-deep portrait of a Hollywood goddess addicted to pills, alcohol, fame, and a little girl's notion of love, but Ken Branagh's Olivier also seems channelled from the Great Beyond. That rat-a-tat voice! Those serpentine eyes! That tight-lipped civility! Like Williams, Branagh offers us not an imitation but an incarnation.   Electrifying onstage, Olivier knew that the new generation of film stars had a mystical relationship with the camera that eluded him. In \\"My Week with Marilyn\\" even Sir Larry grumblingly admits that when she's \\"on,\\" Monroe lights up the screen in a way that he, for all his experience and technical training, never could. The film sent me home to watch \\"Prince and the Showgirl\\" on DVD, and yes! While Olivier seemed wooden and \\"dead behind the eyes,\\" MM was radiantly, effortlessly funny. Whether Colin Clark's intimate encounter with MM is truth or wishful fabrication hardly matters--I left \\"My Week with Marilyn\\" feeling greater respect for the abilities of Miss Monroe, the legacy of Lord Olivier, and the artistry of both stars portraying them.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|i LOVE this concert DVD. The live versions are way better then the studio versions.   Adele makes you fall in love with her. I love her personality and the way she connected with the fans.
B004VMX5TQ|3.0|While the cd has great sound as a remaster, something doesn't seem right about Brave Strangers.  It does not sound like the version from the record.  I know that my ears are getting older but my memory is not.  While I appreciate that they included Brave Strangers, I hope it was not passed off as if the listener wouldn't notice the difference. I really like the ablum version. This is the only reason I sprung for this cd.
0312323867|5.0|After finishing SOMETHING BORROWED, I was thrilled to see that there was a sequel - I had a nagging sense that the story of Rachel and Darcy's friendship wasn't over. I must admit, I am a sucker for sequels that take on the perspective of a former villain. I always love to get thrown into the point of view of an unsympathetic character, and this book began no differently. Darcy begins the book just as spoiled, self-centered, delusional, and generally AWFUL as we remember (perhaps moreso, now that she is pregnant). For the first third or so of the book she is almost tough to read because she is so unrelatable, but joyously, bad luck just seems to rain on her life. But then something happens - and little by little, almost without my even realizing it, something begins to change - and soon enough I find myself rooting for her. Her voice or personality never really change; she sounds like the same person throughout, but this book follows her evolution as a person as she gets thrown into painful circumstances and figures out how to survive. In contrast to SOMETHING BORROWED, where the characters essentially undergo no development (with the possible exception of Rachel developing a bit of a backbone), but rather a change in circumstance - SOMETHING BLUE has impressive character development - especially for the chicklit genre. It's also unclear for the first two-thirds or so exactly where the book is going or what's going to happen to Darcy - particularly notable for the romantic comedy genre, where one can generally tell the ending in the first few minutes. All in all, definitely one of the best chicklit books I've read in a long time.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Bob Seger hasn't done much in the way of recording over the last few years and this compilation of his greatest music just reinforces what we have all been missing. The man is pure Rock & Roll when he wants to be but can he do the slow ballad, the hell he can. This is a MUST HAVE for any Music Collection and will certainly make any Christmas Party really swing.
B005RZ8WIA|5.0|Item arrived promptly and just as described...i had bought in on a pre-order and received two days within release. Very happy.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I just watched the Blu Ray version. The film although typical, is pretty entertaining. The picture quality is very good. But the thing that stands out the most on the Blu Ray is the sound, which is powerful and reference quality. The train wreck scene in particular is powerful, great scene in general and one of the best scenes for showcasing your surround sound system that I've ever heard.
B005FVA3LK|5.0|I had heard the Achtung Baby album was not remastered, but it does sound MUCH better than my original CD.  Very happy with the box set.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Saw James Hetfield wearing a Ghost shirt in an interview and decided to check them out... At first I was like \\"Mmmmm.... eh, there ok I guess\\". Few days later I showed my friend and he felt the same way. Then it starts to grow on you... I mean like huge! I have Ghost songs stuck in my head ALL day at work now, and Im buying Ghost shirts and stuff! My friend loves them also now. Then I looked up live vid and I was like WTF!!!???? This guys dressed like an evil pope!? LOL!  I guess it doesn't matter what the gimmick is if the music can stand on it's own. at a time when its all been done before and done better, and everything has to be EXTREME, they are a breathe of fresh air... first time listen I give it 3 stars... first week 4... then WAY beyond 5. You just gotta let it simmer a bit to enjoy it. Dont listen once and make opinion. GET THIS CD!
0061537969|4.0|I am a high school senior who did not like to read very much, I picked this book for one of my classes based off of my teachers recommendation. I ended up loving this book. Although i felt it took a while to get into the detail of the book and figure out what the whole story would be about, it kept me wanting to read more and more. I loved how Garth Stein had Enzo, the dog, as the narrator.  It gave it a feel that no other book really had and it showed the story from another point of view. This story actually made me cry because it was so touching. Seeing a family torn apart because of cancer and and in-laws really got to me.  I was so interested in seeing what would end up happening in the end so I had to keep reading on. I would honestly recommend this book to anyone, especially students who do not like to read because this book will change your oppinon! I would love to find and read more books by Garth Stein, because based off of this book I think he is a great author![[ASIN:0061537969 The Art of Racing in the Rain: A Novel]]
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|bought this as an easy to use program for my kids and it is perfect. I also used it to sketch out some things I'm working on and it easily did the trick.
1451627289|5.0|This is a must read, well worth the time whether you are a Stephen King fan or not. A truly very interesting read.
B005OLUOVA|5.0|My order was delayed as Universal fixed the problems other reviews have discussed, but now that it's here it was well worth the wait.  I've been listening to Rammstein since the age of 16. I am now 31 years old, and I am still amazed and appreciative of how this band evolves with each album release. The box set is a great time capsule for long-time fans, and even though I briefly hesitated at purchasing (the usual thoughts: \\"so expensive! and don't I have most of this anyway?\\") I suspected Rammstein would come through again in making this a worthwhile purchase.  The presentation: Everything is nestled in a metal case with the Rammstein logo printed on top. My box even has a little  discoloration from rust starting to form, so I suspect each box has a little variance to make it unique. The contents of the box are wrapped in a white cloth which unfolds into a cross, bearing the Rammstein logo and the years the set covers.   The CDs: Another reviewer has discussed the engineering and remastering of the songs, so I will simply say that the remixes are a nice addition, especially since I'm usually not too interested in their appearances on singles. These are the \\"best of the best\\" remixes.  The DVDs: This is what makes the box set for me. Every video has a 'making of' special. Of primary interest to me was the \\"Stripped\\" documentary, as I just turned in a college final on Rammstein's utilization of Leni Riefenstahl's footage a week ago. The 'making of' for this particular video features recent interviews with the video's director and members of the band. The candidness of the band offers a great deal of insight into how they approach videos for their songs. The videos are strong enough to stand on their own; however, the documentaries only add to how I appreciate the videos. This makes for literally hours of Rammstein viewing.  The book: I own the original Rammstein book from 2001, and the Volkerball limited edition book. The images in the box set book have very little overlap with either of these books, so I'm satisfied that these are overall truly never-before-seen images. My only complaint is that the book for this collection is sized just as a CD. The images would have benefited from a larger presentation. However, it is a thoughtful addition and very well-done, with a hard cover and bookmark ribbon. The book also comes cased in another metal sleeve, with rice paper to wrap your book so that it does not get scratched from placing it in and out of the metal.  If you're a dedicated Rammstein fan, this box set is certainly worth your money.
1451627289|5.0|Item was received very promptly and exactly as described. Bought this item as a gift and I am sure the recipient will read it over and over again as she is an avid reader.
0440539811|2.0|Was this book written by one person? It didn't make any sense, the writing styles kept on changing, and there was no plot or consistency. Maybe I missed the point of the book entirely, but after 30 pages I threw it out.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Don't get me wrong... I'm a big Velvet underground fan and a huge Metallica fan... When i heard that they were collaborating, i got excited!  Imagine the letdown I experienced when I listened to this garbage...  It sounds like old throw-away Metallica riffs that they recycled along with pornographic rumblings from the stroke ward at the old folks home.  This is just awful...  A lot of people are saying that this is not a Metallica album, but a Lou Reed album... If I were either of them, I'd be embarrassed to have my name on it...  As far as I'm concerned, Metallica's tour plane crashed shortly after completing \\"S&M\\", killing everybody on board...
0553103547|2.0|I purchased this book after watching a commercial for the TV series (which I haven't seen yet.) I only read the first few pages and had to give it to someone else. It was just talking and sword fights, which was disappointing.

B005FISBTO|5.0|Still the same edge of your seat drama....fascinating characters...Plus some weird turn of events regarding main characters. (don't read further if you're not done viewing season 6)<br />So surprised that this is the first year Dex didn't get nominated for the 2011 Golden Globe Award....the show had been nominated each year up till now...the show definitely deserved it.<br />Only ONE BIG MISTAKE...(JMHO)<br />...Debra, with the help of her therapist, realizes she has loving feelings for her step-bro, Dexter, beyond that of a sis/bro relationship. Too bad they had to screw around with such a uniquely supportive relationship that only siblings share....after all they're the only family each of them has. I really hope it doesn't come of anything for S-7...if they do choose to develop this story line, I'll watch, however, it would be the first season I don't purchase.<br />Keeping fingers crossed. T
0061438294|2.0|Considering the author's experience and background I expected a much more in depth examination of body language.  The book is very basic and appropriate for a teen or young adult.  This book will provide little insight to an adult with years of experience dealing with people.  Much of the \\"revelations\\" in the book are common sense.  Much of the verbiage is either filler or repetitive.
B00003OSU4|5.0|This wonderful full length film lovingly documents both the music and the scene at an early Newport Jazz Festival. The list of jazz stars captured here whets the appetite of any jazz fan, and the film almost always captures the essence of their performances. Their names are in the description, so there's no need to repeat them here I first saw this film in a theater as a teenager. I loved it then and I still love it today.<br /><br />My only complaint with the film is that while filming some of the greatest jazz musicians onstage, director Bert Stern (too) often cuts away to visuals of the scene around the music. He was obviously aiming for a non-jazz audience, but what he failed to understand that the music IS strong enough to hold the interest of the audience! Given the musicians involved, all of them at the top of their game, how could it not be? One of the most unforgettable moments is the incredibly glorious sound of Mahalia Jackson singing Ellington's \\"Come Sunday;\\" another is of Anita O'Day in an audaciously large hat. There are many others. This is a film for the ages.
B004LROMSO|2.0|If you are considering purchasing Camelot:  The Complete First Season, it is probably because you are somewhat of a fan of Arthurian stories, or at least that is what my vantage was in watching a few of the episodes on television.  If this describes you, then I promise that if you buy Camelot, you will be sorely disappointed.  I wanted to love this series.  It is eye catching and, at first glance, isn't afraid to be gritty.  However, the dialogue is poorly written and the plot line is plodding and annoyingly predictable.  It is pretty to look at though.  Maybe watch it with the sound off?
B004A8ZWVU|4.0|The movie is great --- this is a review of the actual disks. I hate the way they are formatted. Every time I play the movie I am forced to enter a language and force the disk past previews. Pretty annoying. The movie is great --- there is no question. Sad that I have to be punished every time I go to enjoy it.
B005FITILO|3.0|Director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody team up again after their success with \\"Juno\\" in 2007.  Here a former beauty queen and most popular girl in high school realizes that her life isn't very fulfilling.  Now closer to 40 than 30, Mavis Gary (an extraordinary Charlize Theron) spends most night pounding down Bourbon shots and finding love in all the wrong places.  Yet, she's beautiful and sophisticated, at least in public.  She wears beautiful clothes and on the outside appears to be very successful.  On the inside, she's mean and unhappy with her life.<br /><br />Now living in the big city of \\"Minnie Apples\\" (Minneapolis), she decides to return to her roots in the small town of Mercury in upstate Minnesota.  There she expects to reacquaint herself with her former high school boyfriend Buddy (Patrick Wilson).  No matter that Buddy is now happily married and has a new baby.  To Mavis that is just an inconvenience and can be easily overcome.  As a published writer of \\"young adult\\" novels, Mavis is perceived as the girl who made the big time by the locals.  Mavis runs into another former student in a local bar who had the locker next to hers.  But she doesn't even remember Matt (Patton Oswalt), a bit of a schlub who Mavis never knew existed.  Matt tries to counter balance Mavis's attempt to sabotage Buddy's marriage.  The byplay between them throughout is the best thing in the film.  Both are excellent.<br /><br />Overall, however the writing is the weak link.  Films like \\"Juno\\" and Reitman's \\"Up in the Air\\" are filled with quick, witty dialog.  Here, it is uneven.  Still, Theron's depiction of Mavis is a revelation.  Mavis is not likeable.  She's clearly damaged and alcohol dependent.  At the same time, we tend to root for her to get it together.  That's acting and that's why this film is worth seeing.
0062112430|5.0|I love this book!  I cannot wait for Pandemonium!  This story held my attention from beginning to end.  Good job to the editor, I love being able to read a well developed story and not find any errors.  While I don't mind editing as I go, I love a good book, with great editing, it makes transporting my subconscious into the story effortless, and with wonderful setting descriptions and character involvement, development, and growth; the author does a wonderful job of pulling you into the story.

B0064BCNA4|5.0|I have a 3 &amp; 6 year old, and with this being the FAOTD, what did I have to loose. I knew my kids would love it &amp;, being &quot;pro&quot; there shouldn't be ads. But with so much negative reviews, I wasn't sure how impressed I would be. This is what it claims -- one octave. The sound is a nice crisp, clean sound for an electronic device. You can choose to play your own tune or use a guide to help you play a particular melody (of which there are a number, 20 at least -- probably a few more). The note color does change quickly from one note to the next, but that's because it is has been touched (played) and the next note is being shown. The only problem I noticed with the color. change is that if you don't already know the tune, you don't know how long to allow that note to ring before tapping the next note. I also read several times that you can only play two notes at once. This is also not the case. I can play a three note chord, or all the keys if I wanted that sound (I know my kids will!). However, TAKE NOTE that you must touch a white key at it's base in order for it to sound. If a white key is touched up high near the black keys, it will not sound. All in all a great tool to get the kids excited about playing the piano. Thanks for the free app!
B005Y423ZC|4.0|Adele, even with vocal problems, is excellent here. The only thing that makes this 4 stars instead of 5 is the DVD editing is too choppy. There were way too many shots of the audience here when the focus should of been on Adele, and those on stage with her. Nevertheless, this is worth the buy. She does curse quite a bit between songs, but it doesn't bother me, but she does drop a lot of f bombs, so be prepared for that. A lot of artists these days will do their set, won't talk to the audience and just make the experience as impersonal as possible, but Adele makes this a great experience for the audience and for the viewer. Get this for the music lover on your list!
B00079HZUM|5.0|I don't much go for costumers any longer, but this one was well worth seeing. A reigning beauty of the London Stage in an era where males played all parts, encounters the first female to be allowed to play female parts. A jarring experience, indeed. On the other hand, the female had never been prepared to do more on the stage but look like a woman without half-trying. The outcome of their encounter makes for fun and games, humiliation and love, ultimately, well, you will have to see it for  yourself. You should enjoy it.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|As I read some negative reviews on the second half of the book, I was somewhat worried when purchasing it, but I did not run across anything getting worse in the second half (as far as quality or style is concerned). Of course, as the author gains experience, the atmosphere may slightly change.  I liked the way political views were presented - with a bit of irony, but by no means too personal.  The book describes the atmosphere pretty well, does not overflow with personal feelings, and offers plenty of action worth every penny.
0553807919|5.0|This book helped me turn difficult periods or moments into opportunities. Times that in the past have gone downhill for me, I am now able to turn around to make us a happier, more understanding and relaxed family. The book explains how a child's mind develops and why it works and reacts differently than an adult mind. I've fallen into a trap in thinking that my children are looking at things the same way I do or that they will feel what I do in emotional situations. That's not true and Siegel and Bryson have done a wonderful job of showing me how a child's brain works and how to get through each day in a way that makes the whole family happy.<br /><br />There are six chapters that talk about integrating the parts of the brain, the person, the family (Parenting with the Brain in Mind, Two Brains are Better than One, Building the Staircase of the Mind, Kill the Butterflies!, The United States of Me, and The Me-We Connection). These chapters cover the 12 whole-brain strategies: 1. Connect and Redirect:  Surfing Emotional Waves, 2. Name It to Tame It:  Telling Stories to Calm Big Emotions, 3. Engage, Don't Enrage:  Appealing to the Upstairs Brain, 4. Use It or Lose It:  Exercising the Upstairs Brain, 5. Move It or Lose It:  Moving the Body to Avoid Losing the Mind, 6. Use the Remote of the Mind:  Replaying Memories, 7. Remember to Remember:  Making Recollection a Part of Your Family's Daily Life, 8. Let the Clouds of Emotion Roll By:  Teaching that Feelings Come and Go, 9. SIFT:  Paying Attention to What's Going On Inside, 10.Exercise Mindsight:  Getting Back to the Hub, 11. Increase the Family Fun Factor:  Making a Point to Enjoy Each Other, 12. Connect Through Conflict:  Teaching Kids to Argue with a \\"We\\" in Mind.<br /><br />What I've learned from this book is a work-in-progress. I am getting better and more consistent in how I handle conflict with my children and I can see it's working. I am so glad to have read this book. It has given me a new understanding of what my children are thinking and new ways to nurture them and make us all happy.

0446613444|5.0|I have not yet finished reading the book but can hardly put it down because of the suspense of NOT knowing how this will end up....Harry Bosh,  one of my favorite characters is really the driving force of the book and I always look for his character in the Michael Connelly books I buy.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I won't repeat the story - others have described it. I just want to say that this movie was about as exciting as it gets. Totally edge of your seat most of the way through. Great story with tons of action, and even some humor that really worked sprinkled here and there. The stunts had me holding my breath. The locations were incredible. The actors are charismatic and appealing.<br /><br />Sometimes sequels don't live up to the original. After all these Mission Impossible movies, I didn't expect this one to be this good, but this may be my favorite of all of them. Action flicks don't get much better than this. I can't wait to see it again. This is one to own.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|King Henry is one of the most intriguing and yet flawed characters of history.  You'll find yourself drawn in by his human qualities of desiring power and sex while also demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of what his goal is as King.<br /><br />Once you start watching The Tudors, you won't want to stop.  The stories are well woven and the love scenes are top notch.  Perfectly cast and expertly directed.
B005DOKIYG|4.0|The sleeve was a great selection to choose and fits my needs perfectly.  It holds more than you think including a stylus I also purchased.  Color choices were also nice and gave variety to the product.  I recommend this product if you just want to keep your Kindle in a safe place that is easy to handle.
B001TAFCBC|5.0|I first watched this with some friends of mine - not my choice but I went along with the group choice.  Never thought I would like a movie with Jim Carey it it, but this movie really floored me.  Don't really want to go over the plot too much because I feel like this movie is at it's best when you don't go in with any expectations.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie! It was a nice surprise to find that this disc also had the color version! I do not know if I just missed that when i was ordering it, or if i had forgotten. I love this movie, and the two disc edition was perfect!
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|Sometimes expectations make all the difference. If you go to a museum with the expectation of seeing representational art, pretty pictures of landscapes and beautiful people, and instead find abstract combinations of colors and shapes, disappointment ensues. If you hadn't gone in expecting a Rubens, you might have really liked that Jackson Pollack.  All this is to say, do not watch Terrence Malick's \\"Tree of Life\\" with an expectation of a summer blockbuster. Or even a straightforward narrative. The film is an impressionistic work that doesn't just move in and out of the character of Jack O'Brien from the present to his birth and his childhood in the early `60's in Waco, Texas; we also see the creation of the universe and quite possibly the characters in the afterlife.  The film jumps from domestic scenes of family tension to static shots of great natural beauty to flights of fantasy. So if you just go into a film wanting to see \\"boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy marries girl\\" or \\"man robs bank, cop chases robber, big shoot out\\"... Disappointment ensues. In fact, some theaters screening this film in some parts of the country have posted a sign saying, \\"This film does not follow a conventional narrative structure\\" to cut down on demands for refunds.  These tendencies are not new to Malick. His first films, \\"Badlands\\" (1973) about a less glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde and \\"Days of Heaven\\" (1978) about farmers at the beginning of the 20th Century, featured leisurely meditations on natural beauty -- but within a traditional narrative structure.  Writer/director Malick took a couple decades off before returning with \\"The Thin Red Line\\" (1998) about the Pacific during the Second World War, a film that began Malick's downplaying of narrative. \\"A New World\\" (2005) about Pocahontas and John Smith had even less narrative drive, and with \\"The Tree of Life\\", Malick seems to work without traditional cinematic storytelling altogether.  But if one goes in without expectations of a traditional narrative, there are treasures in this film. It beautifully captures what it was like growing up in a certain time and place. Even more, it captures remembering growing up. There are wonderful, natural performances by the children, especially by Hunter McCracken as young Jack. Jessica Chastain is luminous as Jack's mother and Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances as a father giving his all but perhaps not giving where he should.  What I appreciated most about the film was the consideration of Biblical and theological issues. The film opens with verses from the book of Job, \\"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundations? ...while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?\\" (Chapter 38, verses 4 & 7.) We then see the characters dealing with loss as Job did, but we are given the context of the Big Bang through the dinosaurs. It is important to remember that God knows our grief, but He views it in a much larger context.  We also see Jack choosing between the path of Nature (what Paul refers to as the Natural Man) as represented by his father and Grace as represented through his mother and brother. Jack even paraphrased the Apostle Paul from Romans 7:15 that he does what he does not want to do. We do see Jack's progress to finding salvation through grace.  If you are open to a different movie experience, you may want to see the impressionistic work of Terrence Malick. Or this summer you have lots of opportunities to see superheroes and stuff blow up real good. Just know what to expect.
B0012BV9FG|5.0|This is a sturdy toy, our 3 year old grandson loves it and the other Schleich dino's we got for him. It's well made, looks realistic and has a great weight to it. He brings people in to show them his collection whenever they visit and tells them all about \\"real\\" dinosaurs.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|You've seen variations on this plot before: an established business is disturbed when the hotshot comes in with an emphasis on the bottom line and effectiveness statistics. The newcomer shakes things up, but soon learns that the old timers have a lot of wisdom and the most important element of any business really is heart.  In 1957's \\"The Desk Set\\", Spencer Tracy tries to bring these new fangled computers to the research department of a television network until Katherine Hepburn shows him that a machine can't match the heart of a librarian.  In 1986's slightly racist, \\"Gung Ho\\", Gedde Watanabe tries to turn around an American auto plant with the principles of Japanese efficiency until Michael Keaton shows him that those business models are no match for the heart of the American worker.  Even last year's \\"The Company Men\\" pitted the sinister bottom lined focused Craig T. Nelson in the world of shipping versus Tommy Lee Jones who, once again, values people as people, not as economic units that can be eliminated to help the stock prices. (Not a bad little film, this.)   This year's \\"Moneyball\\" takes some of these same themes into the world of professional baseball. Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) comes to the Oakland A's and tries to turn around the fortunes of a small market team. The film pits Beane as a manager who values cost cutting, statistics and the bottom line vs. the coaching and scouting staff who value intuition, institutional wisdom and decisions made by the gut.  Except this time, the film gets the audience to root for the guy with the metaphorical slide rules. Beane comes saying he doesn't care whether a player looks good in a uniform or has \\"heart\\", he just wants to know the player's on base percentage.  And Beane is forced by the owner's budget to highly value the bottom line.  Yes, through the film, we see Beane honoring the dignity of players (as a former player himself) and making decisions not at all based on economic factors. But the importanceof science, statistics and economics shines through.  One of the most amazing feats of the film is making what on its face is a very dry subject (baseball strategy and building a team) into a very entertaining, funny, and touching film. (A friend of mine, who hates sports, enjoyed the film.) A lot of the credit goes to the script writers, Steven Zaillian (\\"Schindler's List\\") and Aaron Sorkin (who last year made a topic even more unlikely, the founding of Facebook, into a wonderful film, \\"The Social Network\\".)  Credit must also go to Pitt and Jonah Hill (as his assistant) presenting a highly unlikely partnership that blooms into a wonderful friendship. Readers of the fine book which this film is based on might be surprised by the addition of Beane's family life, which makes this one of the few father/daughter baseball films.

On this second album the joke is starting to wear a bit thin, the lyrics have become more crude and far less subtle, it's just more of the same only less funny, it's tedious and lacking in humour and if it's lacking in humour it starts to get offensive. The people involved in this group need to ditch the wigs and move on to a new project.Just stick with the first album

B004T4LUPW|4.0|Ok so this app is great and has become a part of my day to day life. I put it on my Fire and tied into my Google Cal and it has made keeping life organized much simpler. One of my concerns going over to the Fire was using Google Cal, I'm an iPhone and .mac user and was therefore concerned about keeping a global calendar that worked on all my devices. It hasn't been a problem and this app has been a part of that. It's so simple to setup, arrange and rearrange events, for the most part. I have found that moving around can be a bit of a pain but it's not a small complaint, nothing is perfect. If you need a Cal app that is easy to use this is the app for you :)
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|I heard these set of Mahler, with records between 1949-2010 and I was prepared to support different qualities of sound.

B005K17RU0|4.0|AccuWeather has been very accurate so far. I love that all i have to do is glance at the top bar of my phone to see the temp and if there's an alert. The only issue I have is that it errors out if it can't connect for too long. All I have to do to fix that is open it up to full screen again.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie was absolutely hysterical. Couldn't stop laughing the whole entire time. If you're a fan of over-the-top dark humor then you will love this. One of the best horror spoofs I've seen in a long time.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|I became a Taylor Swift fan after being \\"forced\\" to listen to Fearless and Speak Now over and over on trips and even just around town.  As an amature musician, I've come to appreciate her talent a little more with every listening.  Saw the Speak Now concert and was amazed, particularly in her acoustic cover of a local artist.  I expected a cover since she did something similar in all the previous US venues, but I was still blown away by her version and how well she pulled it off.  She must have done 30-40 or more different accoustic, solo covers on this tour, and I'm hoping that maybe some of them are in the bonus material on the DvD.  Not sure since I haven't watched it yet - it's a gift for a family member.  Regardless, it's a rare thing that can get everyone in the family to take a break from our busy lives and sit down and enjoy together, but this is one of those gifts.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|I got the Max coverage InvivibleSHIELD for my White iPhone 4S shortly after release.  When I received the package from Zagg, I immediately noted that the shield pieces weren't fully cut from the sheet, meaning I had to basically \\"tear\\" them out around some corners.  After install, I wasn't entirely happy with the alignment and bubbling, but I let it be.  It sat for the recommended 24 hours turned off.  Within a week, the back shield would slide around so far as to actually slide off the edges of the phone.  A week after that, I noticed my White iPhone was now a dingy blue hue, due to the shield being stained from being in jeans pockets.

B000FA57RG|1.0|The rating is for the seller and Amazon's poorly detailed information about the item and not for the movie or music itself. I ordered this through the Amazon Marketplace (MovieMars). To begin, I paid for expedited shipping and it really took a long time to get to me. The information on Amazon's site does not state clearly that this is a Region 2/3/4/5 DVD in the PAL format. I had to change the region on my laptop's player to be able to watch the DVD since my PS3 would simply not play PAL formats. And the CD for some strange reason, does not play at all on iTunes or WMP. And of course I cannot make mp3s from it, because it seems to be unreadable. But when I put it in my PS3 it does play it after accepting some terms of use. Weird. It really is a dissapointment. If I had known the Region info I probably would not have bought it. And considering how long it took to get to me, I don't even think it would be worth it to return it and ask for a refund (of 50%)!!.

1451627289|5.0|Stephen King's 11/22/63 will drop the reader into the obdurate Land of Ago in his suspenseful new masterpiece.<br /><br />When Jake's friend Al tells him his crazy plans to stop the Kennedy assassination in the past, Jake is first shocked and then amazed. He goes down the \\"rabbit hole\\" and agrees to change the past, but the past fights dirty. Jake'll need more than luck and knowledge of the future to survive, but will the new future be better than the old? Only time will tell.<br /><br />The past may be obdurate, but King plans to create a new past in his 11/22/63. The characters are amazing and three-dimensional. Each one is unique and plays a part, no matter how big or small. Despite being a long novel, there is a quiet tension filling each page. I didn't want to put it down. I love the historical aspects of the novel and how King brings these characters from the past to life. The philosophy of time and time travel is fabulous. I love how the past harmonizes and the past doesn't want to change. Only one point made me roll my eyes, though. When Jake gets to Derry, we come across an IT reference, which is a bit unoriginal, but it didn't stop me from reading.<br /><br />11/22/63 by Stephen King has done it again with this masterful, tense-filled new novel. I love it, and it's the type of book that'll make you think.

B005KGPC4S|1.0|We expect better from you Kevin, your Mother and I (your audience) expected a MUCH better effort from a wordsmith such as yourself. I'd take ten Jersey Girls over this waste of time.

Avoid this disappointment at all costs.  This is a perfect example of \\"I'll never get that time back.\\"

B001E45XT4|2.0|The product lasted around 6 months...  It looked great, the audio quality  was great also the mic capture quality was not great but good. The poor build quality of the volume adjuster in the cable gave me problems on changing the volume and in the end caused the mic to die since over time the cables in it tend to loose. Tried re-solding them but in the end for $25 i decided not to waste time with the warranty and i just trashed them and now i bought the .audio 655 from plantronics to see if it goes better.
0385534639|5.0|The only complaint about this book is that I never wanted it to end! I very seldomly write reviews but this is one of those rare books that linger in your mind long after reading. That, and I often choose books based on readers reviews and thus I felt I needed help tip the scales toward five stars in case others do the same!
B003ASLJMW|4.0|Like the video very well, have enjoyed buying products from Amazon over the years. Plus I like collecting these old movies.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Someone who really LOVES Pride and Prejudice made this series. The acting leaves something to be desired, but the manipulation of Jane Austen's classic, combined with knowledge of the time era leads to an addictive, wonderful story, with tons of plot twists and turns. Grab a bottle of wine, some fellow Austen enthusiasts and be ready to LOL! And maybe ROFL at the shenanigans our new P&P protagonist gets into.<br /><br />Bottom line: LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!

0618918248|5.0|This is a great book which I have enjoyed reading many times. I've often quoted it to religious people, and recommended it even more. The only thing that's a shame is that the people who NEED to read it (religious people) typically won't read it.. because their fictional god might come get them if they educate themselves too much... scary!<br /><br />I dont track responses to my reviews, so please feel free to comment as you wish, but don't expect responses.
1451648537|5.0|I don't think I'd ever want to work for Steve Jobs, but it is impressive how he really had the consumer in mind with all his decisions regardless of profit potential. It is intereesting to note that so many Apple workers hated him but later in life reflected on what an unbelieveable experience it was to go through not one but 2 Apple revolutions. Its too bad he was so pig headed, as even his health suffered becasue of it and perhaps would still be alive. This book is also an excellent study on customer first, and a way of looking at new prodcut development outside the standard focus groups and surveys. Jobs hated those classic marketing tools, and felt customers did not know what they wanted but he would show them what they needed! And more often than not, he did.

In Blake's words:<br />\\"Today's successful leaders are those willing to share credit as much as possible, who give away as much as they can, and who promote an environment of creative cooperation instead of rabid competition. I confess, when I started in business more than a decade ago, my goal was to become a rock-star business leader, someone whose name would resonate throughout the world, someone whose fame would supersede that of others of my generation - the typical cult CEO. But the more I learned about business and, along the way, about the world, the more the urge dissipated. In its place rose the desire to lead with a softer, more human touch.... A leader can create a company, but a community creates a movement....as a leader, your job is to help others do their jobs better. This is why I tell my top people to help serve everyone in their group.\\"<br /><br />Our world, with all of its manmade and natural disasters, has never been in greater need of innovative leaders to step forward with solutions. Blake reminds us that the greatest of these solutions will be housed in a spirit of service to others.<br /><br />I recommend that you pick up a copy of this book for yourself and as a gift today.<br /><br />Mollie Marti, JD, PhD<br />Author of \\"WALKING WITH JUSTICE: Uncommon Lessons from One of Life's Greatest Mentors\\"

0393078299|3.0|I find that the writer knows his science - or seems to, from this layperson's point of view.  The narrative, however, seems to lack a certain tension.  I read it (I haven't finished the book yet) for the glimpse it gives of these great thinkers as human beings, but I find I'm not as intensely interested in the book as I thought I would be.  But, as an introduction to the movers of 19th century physics I find it interesting enough. Perhaps the narrative flow needed more editorial tightening.

I am very disappointed that Leighton Meester and Garrett Hedlund were not the ones on this CD performing \\"Give in to Me.\\" I like Faith Hill, but she sounded nowhere near as good as they do together, and the song is completely different.

0740785508|5.0|\\"There is no line between fine art and illustration; there is no high or low art; there is only art, and it comes in many forms.\\"<br /><br />I knew I would love this book the moment I read this line from the section \\"Art in the Twentieth Century\\" detailing the shift from demand for original art to printing and publication.  There is a progressive attitude here that treats all forms of art as a means to an end, tools to aid in the expression of a vision.  Leave all your doubts and fears at home because you are here to create, not quibble over what's better or pays more or what art form is more worthwhile!<br /><br />I just adore that.<br /><br />For those who don't know him, James Gurney authored the masterfully illustrated series of Dinotopia books, which show what life would be like if humans and dinosaurs lived together in a world much like our own.  Having penned and illustrated adventures in his own fantasy world, Gurney shares his extensive experience in doing just that - depicting believable worlds that do not exist through a variety of illustrative methods.<br /><br />Gurney explains a brief history of illustration, how industry focus has changed, and what drew him personally to become an artist.  The following sections detail his workspace, developing styles, and identifying artistic influences - all useful for expressing our own unique takes on imagery using the tools and strategies of those who came before.  There's a constant emphasis on developing the idea over the technique in this book, such an important philosophy I wholeheartedly agree with!  For if the seed of a creative idea is there, then it's only a matter of having the patience to train yourself to realize it.  The toughest part of creation has already been achieved!<br /><br />There are so many moments while reading this book where I felt a sense of awe and enlightenment.  Gurney put words to concepts I have never been introduced to, even being a college-trained artist!  His sections on composition and tonal development are some of the most golden nuggets of wisdom I've read.  This book is what my college education should have covered.  Everyone knows Line, Shape, Form, Texture, Space, etc...but do you really understand how it applies to creating a successful artwork?  I feel that Gurney helps to bridge the gap between these esoteric theories by giving us real examples of his working process from conception to realization.<br /><br />Other techniques that really struck me are Gurney's utilization of maquettes to serve as references for his images, which allows him to bring a level of realism to his lighting and placement that would be difficult to glean from the mind's eye.  For characters that appear in multiple paintings, he suggests using a head maquette for achieving consistency in depicting those characters again and again.  What a novel idea!  Sometimes it takes a good book like this to make us start thinking in simpler modes.<br /><br />The final sections briefly cover Gurney's painting process and suggested career paths for artists with tidbits of advice from someone who has been there and done that.  This forthcoming advice is the kind of gold that makes this book priceless and a must-have for any artist.<br /><br />While the majority of this book is not presented in a step-by-step manner, I found his examples illustrated his points eloquently and Gurney's philosophy on art and work methods in general to be just as helpful.  His philosophy and conceptual advice make this book relevant to digital artists as well, even if most of his specific techniques are traditional.<br /><br />This one's a must-have for any artist's collection! I'm looking forward to adding the rest of Gurney's books to my library as well after the inspiration and motivation this one has given me.olden nuggets of wisdom I've read.

0393339882|5.0|I have been reading books on the historical development of 20th century physics and especially quantum mechanics for about 40 years.  The first I ever read was Banesh Hoffman's, The Strange Story of the Quantum\\" which woke me up to the debates in physics.  Manjit Kumar's book is among the finest I have read during these 40 years.  My own particular interest lies in the development and understanding of the periodic table and here Kumar's book has been extremely illuminating.<br /><br />I have previously presented a somewhat opinionated picture of Bohr's explanation of the periodic table as being somewhat ad hoc, to the extent that Bohr did not derive the configurations of atoms but rather cobbled them together after consulting chemical and spectral information. I am not alone in expressing this view and many historical sources stress how physicists like Pauli were also somewhat underwhelmed at the time by Bohr's explanation.  However, on seeing Kumar's carefully reconstructed account of the events I realized more than ever that Bohr's work was still a tremendous triumph.  For example Kumar notes how even Einstein was impressed by Bohr's theory.  This is something that I will need to include in the eventual second edition of my book on the periodic table.<br /><br />Similarly, Kumar's book has given me a clear and simple way to present the discovery of the second and third quantum numbers.  But these are all technical matters and may not be of much value to the general educated reader.  I mention them just to emphasize that Kumar's book is a popular exposition but not a vulgarization.<br /><br />Kumar's book is a popularization in the best possible sense of the word, much like the work of Brunowski and Sagan.  It presents a very much needed antidote to the, frankly shameful, popularizations by the boy-wonder of British science TV who among other things espouses a completely misleading account of the Pauli Exclusion Principle, apparently believing that heating a diamond causes an effect in every other electron across the universe.<br /><br />Returning to Manjit Kumar, I highly recommend his book to all scientifically literate readers.  Complete beginners might feel a little lost but I am referring to those who enjoy the kinds of articles in New Scientist and Scientific American.  What I especially liked was the combination of factual accuracy, an excellent historical narrative which helps to bring the major characters to life, and the philosophical insight expressed in a fairly non-demanding fashion. In addition I believe that experts in physics, chemistry, history of science and even the philosophical foundations of physics will derive great benefit from seeing the history of the developments laid out from such a clear and penetrating vantage point as this book achieves.ry other electron across the universe.

0811879542|5.0|Open the book. Start reading. Watch the children listening to this magical book. Watch the children as the book works its spell on them, mesmerizes them, compelling them to press the dots, to tilt the page, to blow on the dots, to shake the book. Observe the children as they press and tilt and blow and shake. Look into the eyes of the children. See the enchantment in their eyes. Listen as the children cry, &#34;Again!&#34; as you reach the end of the book. Go back to the beginning of the book. Read this whimsical book again. And again and again and again....
B001DHE9KG|5.0|If you have never seen La Bohème, please be warned that there are spoilers in this review - indeed, the greatest spoiler of all, a giveaway of the ending. For you, let me just say that this is one of the best performances available on video or record - the Penguin Guide to the 1000 Finest Classical Recordings lists it as the best on DVD. Get it and be prepared for an unforgettable experience.  But most people reading these reviews probably know this opera, the most popular in the repertory (with Carmen its only competitor for the title), and know how it comes out. For you, let me say that Gheorghiu is a bit old for the part, especially in the filmed closeups. In Act I, this makes her less believable as the somewhat innocent, frail girl downstairs who will be seduced by the carefree Bohemian poet. Likewise in Act II, this is obviously not her first encounter with cabaret life or with the sellers of trinkets and their colorful displays. But starting with Act III, her age starts becoming an asset as it mimics serious illness, and in Act IV it becomes simply shattering. I really mean it when I say her portrayal of the dying Mimi is dangerous - at the end of the act, with Rodolfo's final screams ringing in my ears, I saw in the bathroom mirror that my face was red and swollen with emotion; I dared not take my blood pressure. I have seen hundreds of performances of this opera, in opera houses and on video, and have often been moved. The first time, as an American who knows (well, knew) that all stories have a happy ending, I was at first incredulous that the heroine actually dies and then as devastated as Rodolfo. Since then, I know what happens to Mimi but am still always moved, perhaps even more because the first time I didn't know (which is why I warned about the spoilers above), but never to this degree. If you have a heart problem, be careful - really.

0307959856|2.0|I was all anticipation when I bought this, assuming incorrectly that  it would be at least  a decent murder mystery, if not a skilled Pride and Prejudice take-off. Unfortunately it was neither.<br /><br />The murder mystery part  is badly done; Darcy is betrayed as a wimp;  the writing is drab and un-Austen-like, - and over all it is just plain boring.<br /><br />The dawdling style is more reminiscent of Arthur Conan Doyle - Victorian rather than Empire. Where is the wit, the sharpness, the humor that one has come to expect from Austen take-offs?<br /><br />If I were smart  enough, I'd think of something witty and Austen to say in conclusion. As I am not I will just say, \\"don't bother\\".

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Wow, this book is amazing!  The author paints incredibly vivid pictures with words.  I found the book to be original, creative and well-written.  I can't believe it's a debut novel for this author.  It's hard to know how to describe this book in a review.  I have told several people about it and when I hear myself describing it, I know I'm not doing it justice.  The story is about 2 characters who have been tutored their whole lives to use their special magical abilities in order to win a competition between their teachers.  They use these abilities to create tents for the circus-goers in an attempt to outdo one another.  That being said, this is not a book about magic.  How they accomplish creating unique \\"tents\\" within the circus is discussed, but doesn't overshadow the actual story of their lives.  I loved it.  Read it.

0307408833|1.0|This book is horribly misleading and the author has admitted to not putting the recipes she uses in her bakery. I spent a small fortune on ingredients only to have everything baked come out disgusting. I also made the frostings which were a sweet mess and did turn in to anything resembling creamy. This isn't the 1990's when you were vegan and everything tasted like crap! Now days there are so many options and much better books such as Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World. Great book and she delivers the yummy goods.

Her middle school language arts teacher is who introduced her to the \\"uglies\\" (the first book in the series) and now she is blazing through the whole series!!  This has myself as a parent singing this writters praise!  My daughter is NOT a reader, does not enjoy it and can probably list off on one hand all the books she has ever read.... so for her to find something she CAN NOT put down and is hanging on every word is AWESOME!!!!!  Highly recommend this series!!!
B00006I53S|5.0|This lens was included with the 7D and is a great starter lens. Key word here is starter and if you are upgrading, I highly recommend the 24-105L.<br /><br />POSITIVES:<br /><br />The 28-135 has an excellent focal range, the IS works phenomenally, and the ultrasonic motor is silent and quick. Sharpness is good, but nothing like \\"L\\" quality.<br /><br />NEGATIVES:<br /><br />Lens creep seems like something Canon intentionally built into this lens. As soon as you tilt the lens vertical, the lens barrel travels (rather quickly) to 28mm or 135mm depending on angle. It is so bad, if you google \\"lens creep\\" this lens is the first one to come up.<br /><br />Build quality seems fair, but the plastic Canon used is not the same polycarbonate that is used in the 24-105L or 100L. It's the same cheap plastic used in dollar store toys for kids or more precisely, the Canon tailcaps for all their lenses.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />This lens is a solid lens, both in sharpness, IS performance, and USM. However, I personally would never pay for this other than it being highly discounted when paired as a kit lens with the 7D (about half as much as what you see here).

0756404738|4.0|After finishing \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" and reading many of the reviews here (of which there are presently 672), I am almost more inclined to review the reviews.<br /><br />Here's the thing - if you are considering buying this book, virtually any review you pick is going to be roughly correct.  The five star, the one star, the mixed, all completely reasonable and accurate.  There is a lot here to like and a lot to dislike.  It comes down to what you the reader can forgive.<br /><br />Very much like Gore Vidal's \\"Burr,\\" these books have a present day device on which to hang the memoir - a reason for the telling.  I find the device to be a distracting failure, and the least compelling part of the book (in \\"Burr,\\" as well).  There is some promise that it will eventually matter in the Kingkiller Chronicles, but having read 1800 pages of it now, it doesn't seem premature to complain about it.<br /><br />While you can argue that it simply takes place in a sexist world, the book is deeply sexist.  The two-dimensional female characters flit prettily between victim and object.  Somebody on here said that his wife was the only person he recommended the book to that didn't love it.  Yeah.  I get that.<br /><br />The book has many other shortcomings - they are generally detailed in other reviews here.  Have a look.  Assume that anyone who picks up a thousand page novel is not a semi-literate jerk.<br /><br />But I gave it four stars.  True.  It's because I was entertained.  \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" made better use of humor than \\"Name of the Wind.\\"  I enjoy Rothfuss' relatively clean prose and I was almost always interested in what happened next.  This book, like the first one, is not predictable.  While the fantasy setting is ordinary and there are some familiar devices, the actual plot progression seems like a series of left turns.<br /><br />There would be no point in reading this book first, so ask yourself - after reading the first one, do I have to see what happens next?  If yes, pickit up.  If no, you probably shouldn't.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I almost was not going to write a review.  After all I would be just another ONE of the hundreds of rave reviews about 11/22/63.  But I decided as a true King fan I had to toss my 2 cents in.  I loved this book.  Man, King makes you think and ponder when you read one of his books.  I loved the time travel aspect of it.  But, as we all know there is no such thing as a \\"Free Lunch\\", and as King writes in his novel, when you play around with time all willy-nilly, time will fight back.  No spoilers, but I just loved the ending.  Someone said Joe Hill (King's son) suggested the ending (in fact, I think King himself said it) and it was dead on.  A bittersweet ending to a classic love story.<br /><br />I am a [[ASIN:B000O77SRC Die Hard]] type of guy, but this book has a similiar time travel/love angle theme to it, as does the movie [[ASIN:B00004W46I Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)]] (also a book written by the great Richard Matheson).  I have read most of Stephen King's books, and this is already one of my favorites.  It is also the most expensive e-book I have bought by far.  But, in the end, it was well worth it to me.

1439170916|4.0|As I come to the end of a year of treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, I was unsure whether reading this book was a good idea. In the face of everything I've been through, and as I wait patiently for a diagnostic scan to tell me whether it was all worth it, would this be a therapeutic outlet or an impetus for wallowing and worry?  Amazingly, it allowed me to do two disparate things: obsess about cancer while largely ignoring MY cancer. Merely calling it a biography of a disease sells it short. It's a rich examination of society and humanity, from a single researcher making a seemingly trivial discovery, to an entire nation's imagination being captured by a cause. The scope left me awed.  Most of all, it made me feel like I had a place in this vast history of disease. The similarities between research and treatment will be striking to any patient; each step in the process is a laborious baby step, and when all those steps are strung together, they make an incredible feat. In context of the many patients, survivors, doctors, and researchers who have come before me, you would think that it would make my own struggle seem smaller and more trivial, but it made me feel significant and interconnected.  I also worried that my squeamish nature would prevent me from enjoying a book about medical science, but Mukherjee has a gift for describing anatomy and medicine in a way that is rich without being gory. Reading about discoveries that have led to my own treatment brought tears of appreciation to my eyes, as did the most recent advances in drugs that target specific cancer genes. What could be more inspiring than deadly form of leukemia being cured with a daily oral pill? It sends chills down my spine to think that if I relapse down the road, such a therapy will be available to me -- because in fact it already is. An antibody for lymphoma came out of clinical trials just this year. How far we've come -- it's awe inspiring.  _____  Two caveats: 1. You will initially feel compelled to remember the name of each scientist. Don't worry about it. Several key players will come up again and again, but most are mentioned only briefly. 2. I imagine that in spite of the many inspiring aspects of the book, it may still be hard to read for certain people: those with an advanced or untreatable form of disease, and those who have lost someone in the past, particularly to breast cancer or childhood leukemia. The descriptions of radical mastectomies and early leukemia wards are vivid and difficult.
B00026W82U|5.0|I really enjoy this band's music and this album was pretty good.  It's very subtle, yet powerful songs and beautiful music.
B005V1WZ10|1.0|It seems like such a sad story. A band you grew up with only to grow apart from.<br />I guess Im here to share the opinion of those who feel the same. Now Im not expecting the band to release what they did 10+ years ago today. But i do expect to enjoy it somewhat. That part should be a given. But as Ive said on their last release... I think its time they call it quits. Just go on and do your solo careers.<br />I dont want to see a band Ive enjoyed for so long turn into some sad excuse grasping at their last minutes of fame to squeeze out what cash they can from their namesake.<br /><br />As for the album itself. Its dubstep and Korn. Couldve been done better, shouldnt have been done at all. Whatever the case It just doesnt work for me.

0439023483|5.0|This is a great book.  The characters are well developed and the story line is absolutely riveting.  I could not put this book down.  I have  busy schedule and only get a little bit of time here and then to read.  This book had me longing to get another chapter in as soon as possible.  The author does a great job at capturing the \\"human\\" side of the characters as they are forced into a very inhumane world.  I am not a writer (as you can probably tell) but this book was truly entertaining and thought provoking.  I give it my highest recommendation to all of my friends.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|I bought this product hoping it was the answer that I was looking for. The start of the perfect range is just before my couch starts so I kick the couch on accident frequently due to having to be too far back. It states that it can make you be able to play closer. What I didn't realize was this meant within 1-3 ft from the tv. I don't have to tell you that if your hands move outside of the view of the camera (which due to proximity was bound to happen) that the sensor can't register your hands. Also I had the dark contrast and kinect can't see the floor issues like everyone else. I even spent extra money on lighting and curtains hoping it would help the zoom by finding the perfect ratio of light. The worst part is that it appears to fisheye and your avatar appears to contort in ways not humanly possible on the screen. So if you like cursing, throwing things around cause you are frustrated and laughing at your character doing strange things on the tv then this is the right product.

B0002CHIJW|4.0|I Spit on Your Grave (1978 release) - is a movie that runs the gamut of viewer reaction. It runs all the way from exploitive trash to great female empowerment movie. I don't understand either of the extremes. It is a very disturbing movie, but how do you make a movie about rape that both depicts it & calls the motivations of every participant into question without being disturbing, even disgusting. Most films refuse to portray rape in all its vile violent nature. That can't be said of this movie, although there is no penetration shown in this one.<br /><br />The set up is common enough, a writer of short stories leaves New York for the country & a summer house on a river to write her first novel. She's a typical New York gal, modern, unassuming, fun loving & a more than a little naïve about her safety. She meets a gas station attendant & is seen by two of his cohorts. They are of course bored by the lack of activity & interested in this fresh addition to their neighborhood. There's a man with a child-like mind involved playing a grocery delivery boy too.<br /><br />They all know each other & undercover of providing their man-child a way of getting rid of his virginity they take advantage of her solitude on the river to repeatedly sexually assault her. A warning here as these scenes are violently graphic & sexual, even by today's standards.<br /><br />The movie continues with the girl's reaction to the extreme violence & her choices between reporting them, acting as if it didn't happen or seeking revenge. She chooses the latter & it is as violent as the assault on her. I'm trying to avoid using many spoilers here but once again a psychologically disturbing & violent ending is in store. I'm surprised this film doesn't cause a lot of discussion about the effects of rape on the perpetrators, the victim, the vengeance, the role that law should play & especially about what this girls future life is going to be like. Perhaps it does that in a film class. It's a low budget show but the photography is OK & the acting is dead on. Perhaps the make-up department could have done better on the wounds but they are good enough for this show, like I said, limited budget.<br /><br />The story here is a portrayal of what rape is really like & it's there on screen. If it makes you squeamish that's because it should. It's a vile & violent crime that was ignored for centuries; all the motivations of those that defend rapists are also depicted here. There's little held back. You have to move into porn to get a more realistic image of rape. Due to those reason's I feel it was a good idea to make the movie. It's definitely not a good idea to watch it repeatedly as there is no reason to. You won't forget what you see. I've seen it twice in over 30 years & the second viewing didn't change my memories of what happened.<br /><br />You will not see a slick Hollywood production number here but you will see through the eyes of the victim the dirt, mud, blood & desperation of a victim. You're reaction to the ending may run from disgust to elation or concern. That was my reaction, concern. What future is there available at the end of this extremely graphic tale? That alone should cause some discussion.OK & the acting is dead on.

B005LJK3AC|3.0|Was expecting more, i mean, Jason Bateman, Sudeikis, Charlie Day?? But it was just eh... A few laughs here and there, but not as funny as it could have been. At times, it was actually awkward, and the crude humor was off, like it was the wrong cast for this. Some characters were quite annoying, however Jason Bateman was his typical dry humor self which i really liked and surprisingly, Jennifer Aniston was hilarious. Although, it was quite a flip hearing her talk the way she did, it was so not the \\"Rachel\\" we grew to love, she was beyond dirty. Not my favorite role for her, but good job flipping the script on everyone! So if this movie is on sale and you're bored, good deal. If not, pass.

1416955070|5.0|\\"I enjoyed reading this book. This book does an excellent job of joining demons, Shadowhunters, werewolves, vampires, etc together. This is a book that will appeal to both young adults and adults alike. Cassandra Clare is an excellent author and I look forward to reading the sequels to this book. And anything else she writes. You won't be disappointed with this book.\\"

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|these Angry Bird Games are extremely addicting and to say the least, lots of fun!  One forgets how fast time moves on when playing them...  The Kindle Fire makes it very easy to sit and play, graphics are awesome...I would highly recommend these games   as *nice* entertainment for just about any age group
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoy playing this game. Always find a challenge. Can play for hours. Meditative. I like the different levels or dealing experiences.  my fav is random deal.
0525423656|3.0|My initial review of Matched was a bit mixed.  I liked where parts of the novel went but I was hoping the would develop the world a bit more.  The sequel Crossed was a really long ass camping trip.  Crossed however did set up what I think will be a fantastic conclusion to the series but the majority of the novel felt like filler to me.<br /><br />Cassia has decided to risk everything to find Ky, including her status as a citizen.  She has been sent to the outer provinces to work as punishment and while there she does her best to search for Ky.  I think one of the major problems with the novel is I really really like Xander.  He is a great guy and they are best friends.  He supports her crazy ass search for Ky and even though he is hurt does everything he can to help Cassia.  Ky on the other hand comes across as pouty...but it may be my personal dislike for his character coloring my opinion.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Matched then Crossed is another book in the series and you get a chance to spend time with Cassia, Ky, and Xander.  But just be warned that Crossed definitely suffers from second book syndrome so if you didn't love Matched maybe just read a few reviews and wait for the conclusion to come out.
B005NF2UE6|4.0|I waited a long time for this release and was not disappointed.  Even though there are a couple of songs that ring a familiar tune, the songs are fab.  First time listening through I already had two favorite songs.  Love it!

B001AW156U|4.0|These are awesome i play call of duty with them, but they were not always awesome... when i first got them they were awesome then about 3 minutes into a game one would fall off then followed by the other. they are awesome while they are on. i would give it a 3 star but i took some super glue and glued them in and let it sit out for a day then they were perfect and they haven't fallen off since, and that was almost 1 year ago. so i deducted a star from 5 because you have to glue them or else they fall off
0062060554|4.0|I picked up this book because I loved the movie Memento and this book follows the same type of premise.  Every day Christine wakes up not knowing where she is or even how old she is.  She is jolted when she looks in the mirror expecting a 20 something young woman looking back at her and encounters a woman well into middle age. Every morning her new life is a mystery to her and her husband Ben explains what happened to her and who she is and who he is.  However, Christine starts to keep a journal of her every day activities and starts to realize that her husband isn't always telling her the truth.<br /><br />This started off with great promise and having the mystery unravel was lots of fun to read.  I thought it would become repetitive because of Christine's illness, but I didn't find that to be the case.  My only gripe was \\"the big reveal\\" and how it came about seemed incredibly impossible...but I read zombie novels.  I would say I really enjoyed the novel up until the last chapter or so, but I don't hold it against the novel too much.

B000FC2OHA|5.0|I wanted to take the time to review this book because it really helped (and is helping) me achieve my goals.<br /><br />I purchased this book during a low point in my life in July 2010 at age 34, after going through my divorce.<br /><br />The first thing this book does is invite you to take 100% responsibility for your life. This is really important because this one principle affects EVERYTHING we do, from our work to our relationships to making sure we eat right & exercise, and brush/floss our teeth daily to stay healthy. This first simple principle about accepting responsibility is probably the most important.<br /><br />The accessible tone and common sense advice found in this book assisted me with goal setting, and it greatly helped me with the knowledge that I had to go back and complete emotionally unpleasant projects and tasks that were left over from when I was married.  The strategies in this book are easy to implement and helped me feel a sense of calm because I was making progress on goals and seeing them completed one by one. This book has been on my nightstand or otherwise close at hand since I purchased it and I have purchased copies for two friends. Because of using the methods in this book I have achieved three major goals (they are described at the end)<br /><br />The chapters in \\"The Success Principles\\" that I have found the most helpful are:<br /><br />Chapter 1: Take 100% responsibility for your life!<br />Chapter 15: Experience your fear and take action anyway<br />Chapter 22: Practice persistence<br />Chapter 28: Clean up your messes and your incompletes (probably the most helpful for me out of the whole book)<br /><br />A lot of this book is very sales-oriented and marketing-oriented and you may become annoyed at the author for including what feels like \\"infomercials\\" in the text of this book for other books he has written or for hawking other professional motivators. I encourage you to ignore these flaws in the book so you will be able to getto the heart of the message.<br /><br />During my first few months of owning this book I focused on the above mentioned four chapters. Until you take responsibility for your life and clean up your messes and incompletes you really can't move forward to true success. I am honestly STILL making progress in this area and I have some work left to do, but I believe in the \\"never give up\\" message of this book.<br /><br />Since purchasing this book in July 2010 and being inspired to create change in my life, I have achieved the following three major goals I set for myself:<br /><br />Goal 1: Become healthier through fitness: Starting in January 2011 I began training for my first half marathon. I completed my first half marathon (the Marine Corps Historic Half) in May 2011. I finished with a respectable time of 2hours, 30minutes. In July 2011, I finished my first obstacle course race (the Military Challenge). I am signed up for the Disney Princess Half Marathon in February 2012.<br /><br />Goal 2: Drop the excuses about working full time and just go back to school. Starting slowly, in August 2010 I enrolled in a local community college and focused on getting good grades. Not having a college degree is my biggest \\"incomplete\\" that needs addressing.<br /><br />Goal 3: Earn a Bachelor's Degree.  After two semesters of community college I was feeling pretty good. I decided to set a goal to earn my Bachelor's degree from a prestigious university. I applied to George Washington University and was rejected. Aaaagh! This honestly knocked me on my ass and was really embarrassing. Feeling horrible, I almost gave up, but I went back to community college, nursed my wounded ego, and 3 months later I plucked up the courage and applied to a different 4-year school. (Chapter 22, practice persistence!!)<br /><br />In August 2011, I was accepted to Georgetown University's School of Continuing Studies and I am currently a student in their Bachelor of Liberal Studies program finishing up my first semester. I am on track to (FINALLY) graduate in May 2013 at age 37, with my degree in International Affairs from Georgetown University. Having the courage to try again (Ch. 22 practice persistence/Ch. 15 feel your fear and do it anyway!) made all the difference in the world.<br /><br />If you decide to purchase this book, commit yourself to actually USING the techniques that are presented in it. Otherwise you are wasting time.<br /><br />I still have a long list of things I need to accomplish and my life is still a work in progress, but I definitely believe that I would not have had the courage to try and achieve those three goals (and succeed at them) without the inspiration I gained from this book. I am currently going back to re-read the book cover to cover, to address my lingering time management issues.<br /><br />My best wishes to you in achieving your goals and future success. I highly recommend this book.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I just got my Fringe Season 3 at home and although it took more time than it was estimated to be delivered, all I can say about Fringe is WOW!<br /><br />The writers surely know how to keep you entertained and thinking about what's coming up next.<br /><br />The whole parallel universe thing is so cool and it makes you wonder about how slight changes can make a huge difference on the course of events.<br /><br />I'm not gonna post any spoilers here, so that's pretty much all I had to say.<br /><br />Sorry for any mistakes, but English is not my native language.<br /><br />Hope eveyone enjoys this TV show as much as I do.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|In all the other filmed versions of Dickens' masterpiece, one crucial character is always omitted--The Narrator.  He has more lines than all the other characters combined, yet is never portrayed on film.  Leave it to the Muppets to right this omission after nearly a century!  A witty, charming and astonishingly faithful rendering of A Christmas Carol, even if it does include a Greek Chorus of rats.
B000WN60NG|5.0|This is a movie I will continue to come back to for the soundtrack and story. I found Ry Cooders and Robert Johnsons music through this and it's just as enjoyable today.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|Based on the title, I already knew what to expect from this movie.  As a huge Harrison Ford fan, and action movie fan, I just had to see this movie.  All in all, it's a decent film.  It does move a little slower than I'd like for an action movie.  Also, the aliens look more like monsters than what I think aliens should look like in a movie.  Harrison Ford has a supporting role, and he does an okay job with the part he was given.  The biggest surprise for me was how great Daniel Craig was.  His character, and totally believable acting job, were the best part of this movie.

B005ZHB84U|5.0|In 2009, Hans Zimmer blew listeners away with his musical contribution to Guy Ritchie's \\"Sherlock Holmes\\". Fresh, exciting, and genuinely inventive, it remains one of his best scores to date. Now, two years later, Ritchie has released a sequel, and it should come as no surprise that Zimmer has written the music for it. What does come as a surprise is the quality of that music: not only does it match the brilliant innovation of the first score, it exceeds it. But of course, this is Hans Zimmer we're talking about - one of the greatest film composers of all time. It seems that, like a fine wine, he keeps getting better with age.<br /><br />Matching the style of the film, Zimmer's score is by turns subtle, mysterious, thrilling, and even humorous. \\"I See Everything\\" opens the album on an eerie note, and is followed shortly by the grand and exciting \\"Tick Tock\\". Smile-inducing comedy features prominently in \\"It's So Overt It's Covert\\" and the aggressively playful \\"Romanian Wind\\". The tone of the score changes suddenly with \\"To The Opera!\\", a magnificent piece marked by a stunning array of strings, brass, percussion, and operatic vocals. The relentless pace of \\"The Red Book\\" makes it a ridiculously fun cue to listen to, while \\"The End?\\" treats the listener to a fabulous reworking of the iconic Sherlock theme established by Zimmer in the first score.
B0012GMV76|5.0|Had this years ago on tape. Time passes and tape gets lost. So, a re-acquaintance with  a classic session from 1975 in which Hall, Baker and Desmond never sounded better with superb support from Ron Carter, the overlooked Roland Hanna and Steve Gadd demonstrating his versatility in a straight ahead jazz context. Excellent production and re-mastering of a classic. Good price too!

B0064BCNA4|1.0|Gimmicky app of little use. Latency too much to actually be able to play anything in a musical way. Sounds are low quality, there's no sustained tones, and the octave-plus-one-note range is only enough for the simplest songs. The built-in guide songs offer no rhythms, so playing them is only useful if you've heard the song before.  I tried it while it was free, but would not pay for it as is.

B001F12J48|1.0|This is not a review of the seller, the product was shipped as promised and on time by the shipper.    I never watched the film, so keep in mind I'm not reviewing how good the film is, but the 3D DVD itself.  I purchased this because I have a Samsung 3D TV (7000).  I just assumed this would work on my TV, but it doesn't.  I tried the paper glasses to see if they work, and they do to some degree.  However, I have no idea how you could sit through the entire film with those paper glasses.  Regardless, the 3D didn't work on my 3D TV, so I'll just keep it and watch it in 2D instead.
B0047C2IIE|5.0|There's nothing better than Bing's White Christmas--the \\"unimproved\\" 1945 version with that boomy Philco console radio-phonograph equalization. I love it and all other Bing Christmas tunes of that era. Incidentally, those of you who think Bing was only a 1940s--1950s crooner should take time to listen to some of Bing's jazz vocals from the late 1920s and early 1930s. Until you've heard these, you haven't heard Bing.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|So many movies nowadays are just sucking. So, it was nice to see one that's just good entertainment. The director did an excellent job with this film, as well as everyone else in it. I feel like they stayed true to the story of Star Trek, but didn't bore the people (like me) who wasn't really into the TV show. The action, storyline and all that jazz were good. I enjoyed it. The quality of this DVD, in particular, was really good. I would have liked more Special Features, but that's not promised on any DVD. So, I'm satisfied.<br /><br />Only issue I have (but this is just a personal problem) is widescreen! Ugh! I hate the bars at the top and bottom of the screen! I don't really feel like I need to see more background on the right and left sides of the screen to get into the film. I looked around for a fullscreen version and didn't find one. Now since this is a personal issue, I didn't take any stars off. It's a good movie. So, other than that, this was a good movie on a good quality disc.
0440422973|5.0|This is the first book ever that made me laugh out loud.  The mental picture of Luther hanging from the roof was too much. I read it every Christmas, and laugh every time. It's \\"Home Alone\\" for grown-ups.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Think cowboy smugglers in space, just trying to make a living, all while trying to avoid the Government.  However, life gets complicated after they take on a handful of travelers that end up staying just a bit longer than expected and the crew has to deal with becoming reluctant heroes.  There really isn't a show I can compare Firefly, and that is a good thing.  Any other shows that come after that are similar will have a high standard to be compared against.  The characters are really well developed, the writing witty and humorous, and the plot holds together very well.  I would say the only thing fox did a service for this show was preventing it from ever getting bad (because just look at any good series - there is always that \\"sucky\\" season, or two, or three)  Final note: unlike Firefly, not many shows get a movie after they have been canceled.  So after you finish watching Firefly (my first time was all in one setting) you now have the benefit of being able to find out how everything ends by watching Serenity. Just don't forget to read the graphic novel that takes place between Firefly and Serenity though! ;)

1439192812|5.0|My 8 year old has been asking a lot of questions lately about stars and the universe, She's getting a telescope for xmas) and she's really intrigued by gravity and giant stars like Canis Majoris. This curiosity started this year, 3rd grade for her.  She has asked interesting questions about \\"god\\" and \\"magic\\" and things like that for the past few years.<br /><br />She knows that her step-Mom and I don't go to church but I've always left the door open for her if she wanted to go (she goes with her mother on her weekends). This book allowed her and I to talk about many of these things in a new environmental depth; magic, what is a rainbow, star formation and although she really already knew the answer to these questions, this gave a new perspective and illustration that helps her young mind see things from different angles... which in turn is helping her along the path she chooses for herself spiritually (if she chooses) and her understanding of science and the universe.  As an atheist myself, I don't force her (like my parents did with religion) to believe what I do.  I want her to have the opportunity to believe or NOT based on solid information and facts. Obviously, we discuss a lot of these things already.<br /><br />She probably wouldn't be ready to read this book on her own cover-to-cover, but I'd say it's appropriate for any age child if you're reading it together. For my daughter, age 6 was when the questions really started \\"what is rainbow\\" \\"why is the sky blue\\"  \\"where do diamonds come from\\"...etc.. this would have been a great book to have at that time. The illustrations are beautiful btw and that really helps her visualize the subjects.<br /><br />Personally, I really enjoyed this book as well.  It was not totally simplistic and yet, while it covered some things I'm very familiar with, the tone and illustrations brought the book to life for me.
B006INDMEE|5.0|Brilliant thriller/drama with excellent performances, masterful directing, great themes and an all around intelligent, suspenseful film. Highly recommended if you like ethical and well thought out pictures.
B004OR1X6A|5.0|This is one of Rory's best albums! Great songs! Rory is widely heralded as being underrated (an ironic phrase--lol) for his guitar playing, but I consider his songwriting abilities equal to his guitar playing! Great songs with enough hooks to make them catchy, but not \\"sell-out\\" tunes written strictly for Top 40 radio by any means (Rory was always against writing for the radio rather than writing straight from the heart)! Some songs are better than others, of course, but overall a solid outing. The live CD? Awesome!! Rory is just on fire, with a great blend of fingering and slide playing! His BEST playing that I've heard live--I'm serious!! If you're a Rory fan (or are interested in getting into his music), do NOT hesitate to buy this 2 CD set!! A great deal!!!

Sure you can find cheaper discs, but good luck trying to read them down the road and you'll have no shortage of coasters due to failed burns if you go with a cheapo brand in my opinion.

1612680003|1.0|I've followed this author in various books and interviews, and am well acquainted with his back ground and self proclaimed expertise. He espouses the need for individuals to become their own analysts and \\"get it right\\".  In fact he offers no true blue print for doing this, rather uses short sound bites trying to explain hugely complicated topics in layman's terms.  It's like trying to explain to someone that all they need to build a jet engine is to get some steel, wires, and a pair of pliers.<br /><br />As most industry professionals know, the most important decisions aren't how to analyze a balance sheet, rather it's how to diversify a portfolio and select different asset classes - this drives 90-95% of someones performance, not picking stock A or B.  He disparages industry professionals to be little more than menial labor who come to him with ideas, because HE'S the true expert.  And his posturing of himself as the master, lording over folks who have far more education, training, and expertise than he has just illustrates that he doesn't know what he's talking about.<br /><br />When pinned down to provide specific recommendations on predictions or hard evidence on investing situations he is either very vague or he waffles.  This guy is a good marketer (or just got lucky), but not an expert investor in my opinion.  He's an egotistical poser who loves to play the role of an expert without being one.  Don't bother reading this unless you want to be grossly mislead.  Instead try reading The Investment Answer by Goldie if you're a beginner, The Intelligent Investor by Graham if you're an intermediate investor.  More advanced investors already know what to read, and wouldn't be wasting their time reading reviews for this joker.
B0034G4P94|5.0|This story follows an emotionally scarred family trio.  Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is a high school physics teacher who returns to his former profession (MMA fighter) for extra money to keep his home afloat from foreclosure.  When this financially desperate decision results in his suspension without pay, he has no choice but to engage in mixed martial arts full time.  Meanwhile Brendan's brother Tommy (Tom Hardy) returns home from serving with the Marines, arriving at the doorstep of his father (Nick Nolte as Paddy Conlon) and eventually seeking him out as a trainer for a grand prix MMA tournament which will recognize the toughest middleweight fighter in the world...the tournament is called Sparta!<br /><br /> This already has all the trappings of a good sports fighting movie.  However, we soon learn that Tommy has not a warm ounce in his heart for his alcoholic father, who trains Tommy desperately hoping to find some vestige of reciprocal love in his unflaggingly resentful son.  Paddy also yearns to reconnect with Brendan, who shuns his destroyed father despite the fact that one of his little girls has never met her grandfather.  As if this wasn't enough, the enmity Tommy feels for his older brother is yet more vicious than that reserved for his father.<br /><br /> By composition this is an anti-fight-movie, but somehow it strikes me as the greatest fight movie since Rocky!  The standard formula of a boxing movie relies on several key elements, all such rules of which are broken in Warrior.  1) Extensive training scenes demonstrate the fighter's hardship and devotion--training scenes in this film are minimal and seem more informative about mixed martial arts than demonstrative of the hardship or devotion.  2) The fighter turns to his family for support to overcome the training and insecurity of the upcoming fight--the only family under the lens here is a sundered father and sons who all turn to the fights to escape their family's general paucity of love and forgiveness.  3) The fighter has a resistant loved one and his relationship is tested--Brendan's wife, while clearly not a fan of the idea, makes no concerted effort or threat to keep her husband out of the ring.  4) The actual fights are few in number and serve as highlight montages, building up to post-victory catharsis--these fights are extensive, numerous, and view reel-to-reel as if complete, with most catharsis delivered \\"during\\" the fights!  5) The fighter faces an unlikeable (or at least very arrogant in the case of Rocky's Apollo Creed) or even evil antagonist--the antagonist in this film is the Conlon brothers' unwillingness to forgive.  The single major element that the classics have in common with Warrior is that Brendan is the ultimate underdog and, like Rocky Balboa, fights from the heart.  You never think he should be able to defeat his opponents, but you believe it when he does it!<br /><br /> While this movie is not so much about who wins the fight, it is still very much about victory.  Nick Nolte plays the damaged, AA-devout, alcoholic Paddy to perfection.  He drove his family apart and crumbles whenever he is reminded of the monster he once was and is horrified by the thought of becoming that monster again.  He serves as the bone on which his children sharpen their fangs.  Amid this loveless viciousness, this film manages to pull the audience from feeling irreparably beaten, to excited and motivated, and ultimately inspired--perhaps awestruck.  The fights were thrilling, shocking and technically stunning.  On the softer side, my throat tightened up more times than I care to admit and culminated in some tears in the same five minutes that I was screaming at the screen during the final fight as if I had money riding on it.  Between the exquisitely written characters, engaging fights and solid guy-cry, I can't remember feeling so affected...and it felt amazing.<br /><br />This movie isn't for MMA fans, it's for everyone.<br /><br />Don't miss this one.Don't you dare!

0439796644|2.0|I have just been sent this book as a gift - this fantastic book which I am so glad has now come out in print in the US. I am very saddened however by the quality of this print - it is REALLY cheap - inking errors exist in it and the paperback cover and page paper quality is low - this print is unlikely to make it through being read by 3 children in my house. I have only bought from Scholastic at school sales and this seems the same quality as there - I was not expecting the same for a classic in the making ! Poor show Scholastic !
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Have used it for two weeks. Love it, especially the virtual partner feature.  Won't run without it.  But there are some complaints. The heart rate monitor shocked me!  I thought it is a wrist size but in fact I need to wear it aroung my chest! It sounds like a painful idea so I never use the HRM.  Occasionly the watch are not accurate.  For example I ran on a bridge to go to the other side of the river and ran back.  But the course map showed that I ran on the bridge when I went but \\"flew\\" back 20 yards outside the bridge when I came back from the other side of the river!  And it sometimes show my max speed is 900+ mph, which is double the speed of a jet plane.  Also I can't find the way to show the current speed/pace.  It only showes the average speed/pace.  If someone knows how, please let me know. Also if I stopped for a while the timing graph doesn't show a flat bottom well, be a triangle shaped well.  It should be a software bug.

B0000000LI|5.0|I had never heard of Yanni until I saw his concert on our local PBS station. I was completely and utterly<br />blown away by the man and his music.I am a fan of just about all kinds of music including Classical.I found his concert at the Acropolis to be a blend of classical music with a contemperary beat to it. It was to me a whole new dimention to music that I had never experienced before.<br />After that I did two things. First I went out and bought the CD of the concert. Then I got the concert on video tape. This is a must for anyone who like's either Yanni, classical music or New Age music. This is one of those CD's that you will play over and over again and not grow tired of listening to it.

That being said it works great so far and looks alright. Nobody even noticed at work so its good for not being too flashy.

I mean come on its Tim Burton you would expect much better.
B000XLWEAK|5.0|While I rued the change from a blues oriented band of excellent quality to a much more commercial sound when Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks came on board, I have to say that, while not what I think of as Fleetwood Mac (Then Play On just made me weep it was so good!), I must and want to give full credit to Mr. Buckingham for having brought this band's commercial ventures back into a true art form. Call it whatever genre you must, something amazing happened when Mr. B presented his ideas to the band in advance of this double album. Magic. Pure unadulterated genius pours forth from every single track as it follows its journey from (in vinyl) the outside in to the center label, or (in CD format) from the inside to the very last outermost optical track.<br /><br />I have little else to say. Commercial + blues is a difficult thing (hardly impossible, given the masters we have been blessed with since the British Invasion began), but this album called Tusk is simply perfect to my ears, my mind, imagination, and heart. The soul has been forever touched by the revelations Lindsay brought back from his trip, I think, to Africa, and in one amazing double doobie-rolling platform, the world was given a gift that may have puzzled, even offput some fans, but it has not only withstood the test of time without a single flaw, it was covered by none other than the amazing Camper Van Beethoven in nearly similar perfection. I love both \\"albums/cds/next acceptable delivery format\\" and always will!<br /><br />If you lost interest when the B+N team joined the F+Mc team, please give this solid gem a chance. It went beyond commercial pop to a point that one would consider that genre completely laughable.<br /><br />Yes, Mssrs. Mick Fleetwood and John McVie have often followed and sometimes lead in the footsteps of John Mayall in changing lineups while each found new talent to promote, often to the level of Masters of Rock under the cover of their band's name, often so fast one's head could spin, but in this case, it ended up stopping at the winning combination--a triple whatever it takes on a one armed bandit (no gambler am I!) to set those lights a-flashing and bells a-ringing.<br /><br />In no way am I diminishing the fantastic work of the remainder of the band, but no PR surrounding the release of this masterpiece (my top 10, easily, possibly top 5) came close to ignoring the massive contribution of Mr. Buckingham as Tusk arrived in the bins, possibly years ahead of its time!<br /><br />I read just now that it's been remastered. I am kind of itchy to stop writing and pull out the shopping cart now.<br /><br />Nuff said?ended up stopping at the winning combination--a triple whatever it takes on a one armed bandit (no gambler am I!) to set those lights a-flashing and bells a-ringing.

B004EPZ06Q|1.0|The movie is boring and you can tell they rushed this just to make more money (it worked). It is not funny at all. I would not buy this. I hope they stop making these movies. The first one was good and thats when they should have stopped. If a 3rd film comes out I hope it flops.

B000E5KUK6|2.0|I bought the monster edition of this movie, Im not sure when it was that I last saw this movie, but Im sure Its been awhile.Watching this movie from beginning to end I kept thinking well this is a load of ****.I guess what I wanted was a realistic godzilla movie, what I like is the design of this godzilla(american godzilla) Its more reptilian shape gives it more of a creepiness than the japanese gojira.But mainly the problem sometimes is I had a hard time taking the cast of characters seriously, I mean this is a giant monster destroys the city movie, and the characters sometimes dont act like it. I should note that in making the movie the actors all acted there parts with an invisible/ghost godzilla in there scenes and afterwards The CGI was put in, the special effects are preatty awsome, CGI godzilla looks preatty outdated but still enjoyable.But again Its the cast that just didn't deliver for me, the movie can be a bit of a joke because of this, goofy character design, corny dialogue, And the group of military that have to deal with godzilla seem like a bunch of imbeciles.Its just not a very well executed godzilla origin film.So my final verdict= 2.8 stars out of 5.  EXTRAS= All the monster edition dvd of this film has is 1. All time best of godzilla fight scenes wich isnt even that great trust me 2.Three episodes from godzilla the series and the episodes are=1.What dreams may come2.MONSTER WARS PART 1 3.Where is thy sting, these episodes are also available on seperate dvd media.And finally a production art gellery that has about 20-25 art pieces and I only liked abut 4 of them its not that great.

Peeta and Katniss continue to pull you in right along side them as they fight to survive, as they fight their feelings for eachother, as they fight against the Capital.  And the end.... the end simply leave no words except that I didn't see that one comming!

0385344325|3.0|In my humble opinion, Lee Child can do no wrong. Yes, I am a fan of the Reacher novels.  However, I am somewhat torn with The Affair. Since the reviewers before me did a fine job of laying out the general gist of the plot, I will only give you my opinion. I am torn because I think the plot, characters, and the back story (which is actually the main plot in this book) is up to par. Lee Child certainly knows how to spin a good yarn and even even manages to slip a couple curve balls past a jaded crime fiction enthusiast...  However, I felt the Affair dragged unnecessarily at times and I found my mind wondering more than it should have during a Reacher novel. Why, you ask? I think this book was a little short on action. I know what some of you who already read the book are thinking: this guy is full of it. Again, it is only my opinion, but I think this Reacher novels is a bit dry on the action and somewhat too drawn out. One of the reasons, is because Child tends to spend too much time explaining aspects of the all-too-familiar Reacher logic. So what is the bottom line? Should you read The Affair? BY ALL MEANS! Just don't expect the typical slam-bang action that Lee Child delivers in other Reacher books.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Bought, started and finished reading in one day.  It was so engrossing that I literally couldn't put it down for longer than it took to fix food or take a short humanity break.  The characters, storyline, etc. are fleshed out and well written.  I'm going to be getting the last two books in the series (Catching Fire & Mockingjay) for my Xmas vacation reading.    I want to note that this is not for the timid.  If you read and didn't like plots reminiscient of Lord of the Flies or Heart of Darkness, don't bother with this, b/c that same blackened version of humanity is the core of this book.

B005MYEQ4U|1.0|Great plot line of an ignorant writer shifting from present day insecurities to an illusionary historical past, fantastic footage of Paris (I've been there a couple times) and cinematography, however the movie looses all intellectual points in regurgitating revisionary left wing contemporary political propaganda. To say that France was smart in not joining the Allied Forces in invading Iraq in order to help take down the Saddam Hussein regime (because Clinton and the U.N. for years couldn't) is a typical ignorant Neanderthal  hubris obtuseness from left wing 'Dingoism.'  If anything the opening scene with the left wing idiom being (regurgitated by Owen) overwhelming the conversation at the Paris Restaurant sets the hypocritical stage for the rest of the movie, and the pervasive left French stupor. France like the ignorant European left wing today cannot protect itself from the invasion of illegal immigrants from Morocco and other Muslim countries like it couldn't protect itself from the Nazis in WWII and now we are to accept left wing revisionist dogma from Hollywood in justifying political historical revisionism without intellectual dialogue within the scope of this so called artistic \\"liberal\\" movie.  This movie could have been something great but is like all the dog poop I found walking through the streets of Paris.<br /><br />  Oh and if you want to know what the definition of `Dingoism' is:<br />  Dingoism (D in~ go`- z  m) n.<br />Extreme republic phobia blatantly characterized by a psychotic wimpy progressive political stupor in pacifism, defeatism and capitulation in foreign policy: strapon feminist anti-patriotism unless it has a panacea loyalty for blind feminism: Pansy:  extreme psychotic behavior to `occupy' private or public property, demand everything to be given to them (by the government or anyone with more money than themselves) and to defecate on a flag or burn down something: psychological impediment to except fervently and religiously chant repeatedly anything the left wing academia regurgitates either from the university or the media as gospel: noun Hypocritically bigoted, mentally devoid and intellectually xenophobic toward rational transparent and balanced discourse.tedly anything the left wing academia regurgitates either from the university or the media as gospel: noun Hypocritically bigoted, mentally devoid and intellectually xenophobic toward rational transparent and balanced discourse.

Screenplay by Marti Noxon (one of the brilliant writers behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer); humor in the form of David Tennant; the hawt-hawt-hawtness of Colin Farrell -- all notes that lifted this movie beyond standard vampire flick fare.  Not a wrong note throughout the movie.  A lift to watch.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Isaacson has written a good book, but not a great book. Jobs deserves a better biography and someday Isaacson's authorized version will be the backbone for researching a deeper biography of a man much more complex than the current offering. There is a whole lot about Apple, and a decent amount about Jobs' childhood, but that doesn't dig very far. You won't find much about Jobs' years in the corporate world that wasn't available elsewhere, although the cuss words are preserved intact in a way that adds a little more spice than we'd seen in the media. Stories are nicely organized. A number of outside sources are interviewed, and still, there is little of Steve's soul in this book. It's definitely a good read. It's just not a very revealing one.
1451627289|3.0|I started this book with high expectations.  While I have never been an avid Stephen King fan, I nevertheless enjoyed his last couple of books and had no doubt that this one would be at least as entertaining.  Luckily, I was right...Unluckily, I was right only about half of the book.    Jake Epping is just your typical, average, divorced high school teacher until he came into an amazing secret:  There is a warmhole in the pantry of his friend Al's diner that is a bridge between the past and the present - the past being the fall of 1958.  And before Jake knows it, he has been sent back in time by Al to stave off the JFK assassination.  The catch?  Since the warmhole - or the rabbit-hole and Jake and Al like to call it - can only send time-travelers back to September 9, 1958, Jake will have to stay in the past for four years to accomplish the feat that will alter history as we know it forever. Thus begins the epic adventure that will span more than 4 years and over 800 pages before it reaches it's heartbreaking but inevitable conclusion.    To me, the book is at its strongest when it focuses on the characters.  Jake, after making his way across half of the United States and after altering a couple of life-changing events for people he knew back in 2011, eventually settles down in Jodie, Texas.  It is here that he meets the love of his life Sadie, and here that he becomes part of a close knit community and forms the crucial friendships that will make him consider staying in the 50-60's for good.  During this part of the book, readers can clearly see Jake emerging as a three-dimensional character - a person who cares about his friends and the commnuities he live in and yet is always haunted by what lies ahead on 11/22/1963.  And despite the character-centric plot during this part of the book, Mr. King still managed to build a palpable sense of doom and suspense as he creates a juxtaposition between good and evil, joy and sorrow. My fingers couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  Unfortunately, after about the midway point, the book stalled.  Instead of focusing on the good citiznes of Jodie, whom we actually care about, Mr. King spent pages after pages detailing the daily activites of the Oswalds.  In order to make sure that Lee Harvey and Lee Harvey only was involved in the JFK assassination, Jake rents an apartment across the street from the Oswald residence so he can conduct surveillance on the Oswalds.  From that point on, each fight between Lee Harvey and his wife Marina was described in excruciating detail...each visit from Lee's mom...each visit from Marina's Russian friends..each inane conversation...it just goes on and on.  I have noticed even while reading Mr. King's last book (\\"Under the Dome\\") that Mr. King tends to be a bit self-indulgent when it comes to his writing, and that is in ample evidence here.  It is obvious that the book is well-researched and that Mr. King has a lot to say when it comes to the Cold War atmosphere of the 60's.  But just because the research has been done does not mean that everything should be dumped in the book, especially when the information is delivered in the form of characters so unpalatable to the readers that the readers can't care less about what happens to them.  In this case, tighter edits would definitely done this section of the book a world of good and the book could have been trimmed down by at least 200 pages without losing anything.    In the end, the book ended in the exactly same manner I predicted it would - with Jake racing against the clock to alter history and facing the ramifications of his actions.  There was no surprise to me on how the book would end, but that is not the point.  The point is that Mr. King had something to say about time travel, about the kind of fear peopled lived with in the 60s, about owning up to your actions and facing the consequences..and he did it in a way that was vastly entertaining, the boring middle section notwithstanding.

0312370830|5.0|I must admit I am a fan of most historical fiction novels, especially those that take place or recall the events of the Holocaust, but this one just on all accounts was AMAZING!. The author transforms what could be just another book, to that of something special. When the character Julia was introduced I was quick to judge her a simple minded, do as your husband says kind of woman, but througout the book she completely changed my opinion. Her courage to stop at nothing but the truth really holds your attention.   Now the story within the story is of a little girl named Sarah, who is French born citizen, but of Polish/Jewish decent. You read how she locks her brother in the closet to protect him from the police, believing she is doing the right thing only to later realize that she won't be returning home. It really pulls at your heart strings watching this little girl, so innocent, have to become so brave for her family and herself. She takes the world into her hands and escapes from the camp with her friend and finds a kind older couple who take them in. Once she is there she convinces them to take her back to Paris to get her brother and this is where the author does an amazing job of tying the two stories together.  As Julie's father-in-law describes the day he met Sarah, Sarah describes the day she found her brother's remains in the closet. The stories unfold as to how these two families really know eachother and what really happened to Sarah's brother. The book is well written and truly gripping.
B0002TT0NM|5.0|I became a Harry Potter fan only over the past four years.  Although some of my nieces have been into the series for years, I didn't really get \\"turned on\\" until I bought a VHS edition of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban off the street and popped it into my VCR.  Wow!<br /><br />What impressed me most, of course, were the psychological underpinnings of the Boggart and the Dementors.  The boggart (think \\"boogeyman\\"), who takes the shape of what we fear most, represents Terror, our fear of the future and of what can happen.  The more dangerous Dementors, who can suck the soul out of a person, feed on high emotions and leave their victims reliving their most horrific memories.  If the Boggart represents Terror, the Dementors represent Horror--our paralysis and fear over things that have happened to us in the past.<br /><br />As new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin tells 13-year-old Harry Potter, \\"The Dementors affect you most because you have true horrors in your past\\"--that is, the murder by Voldemort of Harry's parents and the attempted murder upon Harry himself.  Harry himself is already frightened by the escaped prisoner Sirius Black, jailed for betraying James and Lily Potter to Voldemort and of murdering the Potters' friend Peter Pettigrew.  When Harry eavesdrops upon some adults and hears these details, his fear of Sirius turns into a determination to kill him.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Remus Lupin--who has his own secrets--teaches Harry to defend himself against the Dementors by conjuring a Patronus--a silvery-white animal force that chases Dementors away.  A joyous thought and the spell \\"Expecto Patronum!\\" conjures up the beast that repels Dementors, showing how joy and spiritual covering can protect us from depression and from the demonic.<br /><br />A \\"Maurader's Map\\" showing secret entries and the whereabouts of everyone in Hogwarts, plus a secret involving a close associate of the Weasley family, provides Harry more clues to the truth about Sirius Black and the real reason why he escaped.  The story unfolds revealing more about James, Lily, and their schoolfriends, showing how the past, and how one's parents, impact one's life today.<br /><br />Another exciting aspect of this story is Hermione's experiments with an overloaded schedule, which lead her and Harry to pursue a time-travel adventure which reflects even more upon the power of the past.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban touched me for three reasons: the Dementors portrayed as bad policemen who care nothing for justice and everything for power, who in their lust for nourishment don't distinguish between the guilty and the vulnerable; the psychological truth about depression and about joy as its antidote; and the spiritual truth about protection provided by the Father figure (\\"Patronus\\").  From this film, I eagerly pursued and viewed the other films, and then read the Harry Potter novels, which are so exciting and so deep, filled with many spiritual and psychological insights.he escaped.

0439023521|5.0|From the very beginning this book had my attention. Whether it was the unpredictable events  in the book, or the idea that another \\"United States\\" takes place after we completely destroy the earth with war, I couldn't help but stay up all night reading. Katniss draws you in to her world as the sole provider of her family. She makes sacrifices day in and day out to make sure that they are taken care of and that they have enough food to eat, but her most selfless act is which she sacrifices herself in place of her younger sister, Prim. From that moment you become a part of her world. You watch her transform from a young girl who is willing to run away from the District with her family to protect them, to a woman who is willing to fight to prove to the Capital she is not just a player in her games. What truly captivates you in the love triangle that begins between herself, Peeta, and Gale. Although Katniss would never have considered either one in the beginning, finding herself in a \\"relationship\\" with Peeta, makes her question her feelings for Gale, and questions herself time and again. I found myself rooting for Peeta and their relationship, but with that comes a twist. Suzanne Collins does a magnificent job at keeping the reader intrigued and never gives too much away. Great read!

B006BQI1V2|3.0|I must say I was disappointed in watching this movie. I fell in love with the book and for me, the movie just didn't do it any justice. Now in all honesty, I do understand that to capture all the moments in the book and play them out into a movie would have made the movie a 2 part event, but so much was left out that if I had not read the book first, I would have shut the movie off in the first 20 mins. They did their best with trying to tie the 2 events together ( Julie writing about the Vel' d' Hiv and Sarah finding her brother's remains in the closet) but they left out so much information such as why Julie left her husband and moved to New York with her girls? They also showed her husband, Betrand, and a nice husband who loved and cared about, not the cheating jerk who was sleeping behind her back for 20 years. I was also disappointed at the ending. They implied that the only happy ending would be for Julie and William to end up together, however they failed to even imply that he left his wife, or that he even had a failed marriage. This movie could have been so much better, just thankful I read the book as it was a great one!

Then and from Season 3 it turned into some awkward lame drama, like someone thought he would make Friends show reloaded, only made it completely wrong. Suddenly all these nerds have to think about and do is date and hang out with girls, barely anything nerdy or scientific to remember in the whole season.<br /><br />while the of this review might technically contain some spoilers, I would argue: \\"SPOIL WHAT?\\" Nothing to spoil anymore.<br /><br />You would watch one episode after another, thinking they must realize they've taken missteps, and things will turn up right. One episode it all seems like breakup is on the horizon, and there will be one less girl to worry about. And then silly twist and she's back stronger than ever. This isn't the show we liked. It's aimed for different crowd, poorly written, not deep at all.<br /><br />I felt bad about Season 3, and I heard many people stopped watching the show during Season 4. I neglected them thinking nothing can be that bad. I stand corrected, it could be even worse than they described.

B004G600A4|5.0|I have reviewed films professionally and I could break down which of the Disney films, including Pixar, is the best of all time, but all that needs to be said is that this is simply the most watched Disney film in our home.  Both my 3 year old and I love it.  So fun.  So many great songs.  Fun characters and banter.  When my daughter gets a little older, perhaps Beauty & The Beast or Cars or Finding Nemo will trump it, but for the last year no film has come close to it's repeated viewings.    And if you want to know if your little girl will enjoy the story of Rapunzel, know that the line to get your picture taken with Rapunzel at Disneyland was, by far, the longest line of the day the last time we were there.  Buy this movie.  It will not disappoint.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I usually don't write many reviews on this, but I absolutely LOVED this book. I stayed up until 2:30 reading it, and even thought about attempting to read it while on my way to work. I found myself smiling throughout the book, and my boyfriend looking at me like I am crazy. I found myself connecting with the characters.   Abby decided to move to a college away from home so that she could escape her past. She vows to stay out of trouble and start a different life. All of that changes the day she meets Travis, the bad boy who fights underground at their school whom womanizes every girl he is around. Although, when he meets Abby, it's different. He wants to be her friend. Abby is a bit stand off when she first starts hanging out with him, but they soon become very comfortable together. Their relationship becomes a huge roller-coaster, where they develop a love/ hate relationship. I loved that it was not a typical boy meets girl , then fall in love. The End. This book has you going a thousand different ways. It has become one of my favorite reads, and is well worth the price.

B004WR125O|1.0|This tiny adapter proved useless on my Onkyo TX-8050 receiver, which is 25 ft (2 walls) from router. -- all net stations dropped out every 20 seconds or so. For less than half the price, I purchased a TP-Link-TL-WN722N,  which works perfectly, with no dropouts. I already had my router information saved on the receiver, and the TP-link unit just started working right away. The only disadvantage is that it is much larger and more conspicuous than the UWF-1, but effectiveness beats looks.

This is a must if you love heavy heavy metal buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0064BCNA4|2.0|I could have designed something better!!! If this doesn't convince you that this is garbage then consider the fact that I have no experience in programming, in fact I'm willing to say that my dog could do better.   Any lets get right to the point, this things application picture looks better than the application, after all the programmer deemed that several white and blue blocks that occasionally flash blue is enough to fill your phone/tablet's screen, and is enough to make this garbage a paid app. Also if you press 3 buttons slightly quickly then the noise emmited from the &quot;piano&quot;  starts to crackle and turns indistinguishable.  And the final thing that makes this a unworthy of being an application is the replayability value as this provided entertainment for about 5 minutes until I decided to uninstall this.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This movie is the definition of charming.  It feels very light and I actually like the whole 'moral' the movie attempts to convey. It is well done.   I am also glad to see Woody not starring in his films anymore, he is a bit to much of a neurotic for my taste and Owen Wilson does a good job of the woody persona.
B0064BCNA4|4.0|Nice simple FAoD piano app that has some simple  guides of basic songs.  Blue keys light up, but you have to know he tune in order to play it with correct time.  Ok for my 4yo, but she likes her $5 book player that has a better and REAL keyboard - 2 octives.  Honestly fine for free, but NOT worth a dollar.  4 stars for.the.effort and for free.

B0055SWM08|5.0|A derivation of the classic &quot;guide  the ball to catch pearls;avoid traps while using blocks to plan your stops &quot;. The avaricial gems replaced with raindrops, the sound track soothing classical instead of jarring coder/computer/neo-generic/post-martial, and the visuals a pleasingly unobtrusive expressionist pastorale.  All right, I exaggerate. Yet when you need a calm real game as your stress slips away, this is your experience. A drop of calm reasoning and a bit of the &quot;looking outside the box&quot; is All you'll need for a delightful and restorative few minutes. No guns, no world to save, no on-screen Flasher counting down your few moments left to live. Not for the testoserone-based life form.
0307270807|1.0|I think this book is a waste of good paper and ink. I find it nearly impossible to read and even more impossible to believe it recieved enough good reviews for a 4 1/2 star average. There is no storyline,no characters to identify with or get to like or dislike. The descriptions are so overdramatized that they lose their credibility and become so unrealistic that it's laughable. The era specific terminology is just thrown at you with no way for the average reader to understand. It's really just a bunch of unrelated bits of narrative that aren't even interesting. I got to pg 46 and gave up. Don't waste your $$ on this book. Try CLOSE QUARTERS for an excellent A+++ read on the Vietnam war.

B00138KEZ4|5.0|This morning I went through my seasonal hunt for new Christmas music, going through Amazon previews of several albums and following links to new recommendations.  Usually around a week before Christmas I binge on downloads.  This year...it is amazing how even different styles ended up sounding like - just more of the same.  I gave up and searched through my music library for something to listen to.<br /><br />Wintersong.  I had purchased Wintersong in my previous year's download binge and maybe listened to it once, probably while I was doing something else.  I queued it up now, and over a couple tracks made a discovery - this is NOT just another Christmas album!<br /><br />I am new to Sarah McLachlan - she had not entered my musical universe before now - so I came to this with no preconceptions.  Here is what really struck me about Wintersong:<br /><br />Her voice - obviously well trained - is absolutely gorgeous!  The production and arrangement allow her to come through like an angel.<br /><br />The feeling she brings is deep and thoughtful - she makes me rethink even very traditional songs, and pay attention to the new songs/covers.  Christmas clearly means something to her.  It makes this a very emotionally involving album.<br /><br />The music - a nice mix of traditional, new, and modern favorites, arranged to bring the songs to the fore, and relaxed so you don't feel like its going helter-skelter through the required playlist.<br /><br />The production.  I am an ENEMY of the compression/loudness movement which reduces every track to sonic wallpaper (emphasis on the paper).  I hate it when a really good artist is let down by a recording engineer with no restraint (e.g. Eli Reed's first two albums).  I love the clarity of the recording (of course the arrangements make that easy).  Wintersong sounds GREAT.  And frankly, makes me hanker for a really high-rez download (like a 24-bit/96kHz FLAC)....<br /><br />This is going to be in heavy rotation at my place for thenext couple weeks, and may be the perfect centerpiece for the Christmas Eve playlist.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Amy was one of a kind, and every CD of hers is one of a kind. I cannot get enough and play her CD's over and over; each time I appreciate something new, something emotionally powerful in the band and the vocals. This has the original recording of Wake up Alone and it's one of the finest torch songs ever written. Some of the lyrics on this track: he's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts, he floods me with dread, soaked to his soul he swims in my eyes by the bed, pour myself over him, moon spilling in.....who couldn't feel the angst and passion in Amy's song? As music enriched her world, her music has enriched and inspired mine! Rest in peace, Amy. You are loved. This CD is indeed a treasure - everything I hoped for and more - many genres in one!

B005FITIK0|4.0|Without an iota of irony, Charlize Theron finally uses her intimidating beauty for pure Machiavellian evil, and the results are fortuitous in this dark-hued 2011 comedy, the latest collaboration of director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody ([[ASIN:B000YABYLA Juno]]). She's absolutely spot-on terrific playing Mavis Gary, the condescending, hateful high school girl who comes back to Mercury, her podunk hometown nearly two decades later. Mavis is no Blanche Dubois-type character whose ladylike beauty has faded into a gauzy romantic delusion. No, Mavis is still one hot babe and very much the complete narcissist she was as a teenager, emotionally stunted despite her relative worldliness having moved to Minneapolis to become a ghostwriter of a series of teen novels.<br /><br />It's not surprising she finds success writing for an adolescent audience since she still defines her life with teenage-level priorities and fantasies. As she has proven with [[ASIN:B000YABYLA Juno]], Cody is thoroughly fluent with this perspective, but the twist is that this time, it's coming from a jaded 37-year-old woman. Even though Mavis is a divorcee who lives in a high-rise apartment with a toy dog and can easily get any man she wants, she is triggered by a birth announcement email she receives from her high school sweetheart Buddy Slade and becomes fixated on getting him back all these years later. It doesn't matter that he's happily married and perfectly content living in Mercury. She concocts a scheme to make herself so alluring that he will want to run away with her. Normally, this would be an excuse for broad comedy machinations, but Theron is so gorgeous that it makes her shameless attempts at seduction look all the more edgily desperate.<br /><br />It's a narrowly developed plot for sure, but surprisingly, what enriches the proceedings is the unexpected relationship Mavis develops with Matt Freehauf, a sad-sack former classmate whose sole claim to notoriety was being the victim of a hate crime when he was beaten up and left for dead by a group of jocks who assumed he was gay. Now crippled physically and emotionally, he lives in Mercury with his sister making his own home-brewed bourbon and putting together mix-and-match action figures. That Mavis and Matt connect is all the more intriguing since they were at opposite ends of the social spectrum back in school, and their bond is fueled by her obvious alcoholism, a point that is overlooked by her befuddled parents who wish to think of Mavis as the flawless pretty daughter of their own deluded fantasies. The story evolves in the direction you would expect but not before certain revelations come to light in a tortuous scene at the baby-naming party Buddy and his sensible wife Beth have with all their relatives and close friends in attendance.<br /><br />Beyond Theron's fearless work and intentionally deadpan line delivery, there is comedian Patton Oswalt's surprisingly affecting performance as Matt. I only know him from his recurring role as a comical sad-sack on the sitcom [[ASIN:B005D0OHA6 King of Queens]], so it's surprising to see the amount of texture he brings to this role. As Buddy, Patrick Wilson once again plays the sought-after himbo, but this time, his character's unshaven, small-town modesty comes across as more contrite with his character's feelings toward Mavis left quite elliptical. Elizabeth Reaser ([[ASIN:B000P5FH26 Sweet Land]]) isn't given that much to do as Beth, probably by intention, but Collette Wolf has a few impactful moments as Matt's insulated sister still idolizing Mavis after all these years. As he showed with [[ASIN:B000YABYLA Juno]] and [[ASIN:B003E88TKS Up in the Air]], Reitman shows a deft hand with actors playing flawed characters who try to manipulate their circumstances but fall short of their vaunted expectations.en he was beaten up and left for dead by a group of jocks who assumed he was gay.

B003Y5H5FG|4.0|In 1985, the original FRIGHT NIGHT was released and it was an immediate classic. The next door neighbor of a teen turns out to be a vampire, leading to a showdown between the unlikely hero and the near invincible creature of the night. So, in 2011, when FRIGHT NIGHT, a remake or re-imagining was released, I wasn't particularly eager to see it. There are too many remakes as it is and to remake something that was such a classic didn't make much sense, but they remade TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and FRIDAY THE 13th, so why not?   The first thing that stands out in the new movie is that everyone looks like a model for the most part. There was no average looking people. Even the high school teacher was attractive and when I went to high school, the women were all elderly or pigs...there were no hot teachers. Everyone in the classroom, with the exception of the intentional geek, Ed (Christopher Mintz - Plasse), could have been on the cover of a magazine. You see this all the time now. They don't even take fat extras anymore.  Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is a teenager that lives in a little community in the desert of Las Vegas, Nevada. His next door neighbor, Jerry (Colin Farrell), makes a bad impression immediately by having a huge dumpster parked in his driveway. Charley's mother, Jane (Toni Collette), makes a fuss, but when she is charmed by Jerry, she lets it go. He just seems like a nice guy that she wouldn't mind banging.  Ed is a hilarious character, much like the first. This time, Charley used to be best friends with him, but the pressure of high school has prompted him to cut ties. He is now with the \\"in crowd\\" while Ed is an outcast, but he is not a quiet one. I thought it was hilarious how he kept blackmailing Charley with pictures and video of the past, where they were battling Dungeons and Dragons style. Unfortunately, Ed's time on the screen isn't much, and Jerry takes him out quite early. It was a surprise, which is part of this film's charm. You think one thing is going to happen, but something else does.  One of the coolest scenes in the film is when Charley goes looking for Ed, who is missing. He goes to his house and starts fishing around on his computer, finding video that Ed recorded. Jerry doesn't appear on the video. Vampires don't cast a reflection and to see the vehicle drive up and the door open without anyone visible getting out was quite cool. Ed saying \\"I got you,\\" made the scene even better. It was a nice variation of the original where Peter Vincent realized that he didn't see Jerry in the mirror.  In the original, Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) was a cheesy horror host that you would see all the time in the 1970s. Considering the differences in time, the character had to be changed and so now we have Peter Vincent (David Tennant), a Mindfreak sort of magician in Vegas that is known as the \\"Vampire Killer.\\" You can't replace McDowall and the character isn't nearly as charming, but I still found Tennant's portrayal very amusing.  Charley and his girlfriend, Amy (Imogen Poots), approach Peter after Jerry turns vampire and attacks the duo and Charley's mom on the road. The CGI look of the full-fledged vampire wasn't so great. He looked reptilian and cartoonish, but CGI is winning over traditional make up, and here is another example. The look of the first vampire in the 1985 flick was way better.  Jerry kidnaps Amy and now Charley and Peter Vincent are off to kill Jerry and save her. It is a big showdown in the house in Vegas.  FRIGHT NIGHT isn't as good as the first, but it is not without its charm. It moves a little quickly and the look of the vampires was pretty mediocre, but the characters are very likeable, especially Ed, and the movie is different enough to stand alone as a good horror entry. I recommend it.  NB Rating: 7/10.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|A violent death in the woods outside Pemberly: you would expect P.D. James to do a better-than-average job with this material. James makes some attempt to write in Austen's manner, but lacking her subtle wit, just ends up sounding stiff and anachronistic. And whenever her characters reminisce over events from \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the writing actually turns cringe-worthy. Even the mystery isn't up to James' usual standard. Reader, pass it by.
1423140591|5.0|I can't believe I actually let this book sit on my shelf for nearly a month before picking it up (durn real life commitments)! I LOVED this second installment in Rick Riordan's The Heroes of Olympus Series. Riordan continues to awe, amaze, and inspire me with his magical way with words and his status as a master storyteller.<br /><br />I am going to try and be as spoiler free as possible in this review! If you haven't read the first book in this series, The Lost Hero, then you really must...actually, you should really start with The Lightning Thief, the first book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians Series...seriously, go, run and read them now...I can wait...<br /><br />As the lengthy synopsis states, in this installment, we find our hero Percy without his memory and only with the barest recollection of who and what he is. Fighting his way through monsters, Percy ends up at Camp Jupiter, a camp for demigods- children and descendants of the Roman Gods. At Camp Jupiter, Percy's status as a son of Neptune is not seen as a good thing and he is quickly looked upon with distrust and caution. But then Mars, the god of war, declares that Percy and his new friends, klutzy Frank and unusual Hazel, must travel to the land beyond the gods, Alaska, and free Thanatos (Death). So the three demigods set out on a dangerous and deadly adventure.<br /><br />First of all, I was simply ecstatic to have Percy back, as he was not in the The Lost Hero. I did not realize how much I missed him! Even without his memory, Percy is still very much the same lovable, awesome character he has always been. He's still brave, loyal, funny, and honorable. But, he's also matured and grown in the months since the events in The Last Olympian. And I enjoyed every second spent with him!<br /><br />Riordan simply gets better and better with each book he writes. What I'm loving about this series is that it doesn't feel repetitive or seem to just mirror its predecessor. Of course, it is similar to the first series, but it's always entirely fresh and original in its own right as well. It has the same enchanting, captivating, magical quality of the first series, but Riordan has really added new, intricate layers and has expanded this world wonderfully.<br /><br />It was so much fun exploring a whole new realm of gods and goddesses. Camp Jupiter, with its Roman gods, is just has fascinating and spellbinding as Camp Half-Blood, although it is vastly different. Riordan has really offered readers a whole new world within a familiar setting.<br /><br />While I certainly missed the characters from the first series and from The Lost Hero, I definitely loved meeting all the new characters in this book. Riordan does an amazing job of creating realistic, relatable, and likable characters that come across has both entirely unique and endearingly average. I fell in love with Frank and Hazel as quickly and as much as I did with Jason, Piper, and Leo in the first book. Although, I'll admit that Percy, Annabeth, and Grover will always be my favorite unstoppable trio.<br /><br />The action and thrilling excitement does not disappoint in this book! Even older readers (ahem, like me) will find themselves reading feverishly with a racing heart. My attention was grabbed from the very first sentence and I simply fell into the story, never wanting to leave. In fact, with only about 100 pages left to read, I actually forced myself to set the book down for a whole day because I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I found this book to be quite educational. With the first series, I learned a great deal about Greek mythology and with this book I not only learned about Roman mythology, but also about the rich, complex history of Ancient Rome. And the best part is that younger readers won't even realize they're actually learning something because they will be having too much fun immersed in Percy's journey! How cool is that parents and teachers?!<br /><br />MY FINAL THOUGHTS: The Son of Neptune is a phenomenal second installment in a spectacular series. Rick Riordan continues to enthrall and entertain readers (young and old alike) with his creativity, intelligence, and awesome ability to weave a story. Fans of the first book will not be disappointed and readers who have yet to discover this series are in for a wonderfully magical surprise once they do. A definite and total MUST read for all fantasy fans.an continues to enthrall and entertain readers (young and old alike) with his creativity, intelligence, and awesome ability to weave a story.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I wanted an automatic watch that was accurate, waterproof, trouble free and affordable. I read all the specs and reviews and liked the Seiko SNK809 but I was confused about it's water resistance. Amazon listed it as 300 feet but Seiko and reviews said 30 feet and not suitable for even a shower.  At $55 the price seemed right so I ordered it.  It arrived, I set the time and took a shower. For the last 5 weeks I have worn it non stop. We went to Florida and I wore it while snorkelling and swimming with the fishes. There is no trace of internal moisture or fog. I am amazed at how accurate it is, after a month it was out a couple of minutes.<br />It has a canvas type military strap that looks good and held up fine to salt water. This is one fine watch!<br /><br />I have now had the watch 6 months and it is great. Still waterproof.  Got back from 2 weeks of snorkelling in Mexico. I usually set it about once a month and it slowly gains a few minutes over the month.

B005HP2JAM|3.0|How is it that this supposedly well filmed documentary is so washed out and crappy? I was expecting eye-popping color and subtle tones in my Blu-Ray copy and what I got for $35.00 was ghastly contrasts and severe lack of rich color.  Was this supposed to be B&W with scant highlights?  And the music could have been SSOOO much better.  I really appreciate being able to see the vicinity and the repeated view angles of the art were fine and interviews with those working at the site was interesting, but over-all I wish I had waited for it to come out on the History Channel.  Thumbs down.

0307595579|3.0|I bought this box set and am currently 2/3 through the third installment.  A lot of people have said this, but let me reiterate: the writing is bad for two reasons:  1) The translation from the original Swedish to English is not well done.  Weird sentence structure, bad word choices, incorrect use of idioms, etc.  It's so noticeable that I could swear two different people translated and edited the first and second books.  2) My other criticism is that the author spends too much time setting the stage for drama.  This was obvious in the first book, better in the second book, and painfully evident in the third book.  In the first book, the whole story leads up to a rather laughably off-the-wall explanation, and the \\"action\\" finally takes place in about four pages.  I'm on page 385 of book 3 and the reader is basically is in the same position as at the opening of the novel.  To me, this is just plain bad writing mechanics; there is just no excuse.    That having been said, the series is clearly a huge hit.  I am glad I'm finally reading it after hearing so much about it.  The characters are certainly imaginative, and the plot is creative.  I am struggling to finish the worst of them (book 3) so I can see the movie, which looks seriously good.  When I am done, I will give this set away to someone new to the series and wish them better luck than I had.  I know once I am done I will never feel compelled to pick up and read the books a second time.

0307959856|1.0|THIS STORY WAS SO SHALLOW AND DISINTERESTING.  THIS MAY BE P.D.JAMES' MR.DARCY, BUT IT CERTAINLY ISN'T MINE.  I ONCE HAD A BLACK LAB DOG THAT I NAMED DARCY AND I DO   BELIEVE MY DOG WAS MORE INTERESTING THAN P.D.JAMES' DARCY.  OH WELL! I'AM SURE THERE  ARE MANY OF US THAT STILL PLACE HIM NUMBER ONE ON OUR LIST.
0345529057|4.0|$20 was a great price for all 4 books considering that I paid $14 for Game of Thrones alone at Target. My only issue is how small the books are. The condensed paperback is 1000 pages and has quite small print.
0307949486|1.0|I was willing to wade through the opening pages to read this--struggled with the financial expose, and slow, torturous plot. But at page 200, I'm ready to give up. I just read how the handyman plowed out one of the Vanger's driveway and made him made. After 75-100 words, I discovered he couldn't plow out Blomkvist's. His girlfriend, angry that he left and decided to research the death of Harriet Vanger, now shows up. They walk, everything's closing up, so they eat veal and potatoes.<br /><br />Why should I care?<br /><br />For two hundred pages, this book reads like someone's genealogy. It is as interesting as one.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great game no issues. Game works like it should. Add pops up between games but not a big annoyance. I recommend.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Having lived in Texas in 1963, and watching it all unfold on TV at the time it really happened, I was completely wound up in this book, couldn't finish it fast enough, didn't want it to end. It brought back memories of me seeing the event on TV and my 2 year old daughter, hugging me wondering why I was crying. Memories of seeing some of the places in the book and of the times was right on. Also enjoyed visiting Derry again. I am an avid King reader, and always look forward to everything he writes. I got the kindle edition.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This are great words to describe Evernote. It's definitely an application one must have. Allows you to be syncronized with documents -notes, pictures, etc- in all the electronical devices with Evernote installed. Most importantly it is easy to use, quick to access and has a great interface. I simply love it. Go ahead and give it a try.

B005PUUMK8|3.0|It has been something of a lingering debate in classical music ever since Pollini won the Chopin Competition in 1960, namely whether his allegedly moderinsed way of playing Chopin brings greater depth and magisterialness, as claimed by his followers, or whether it merely amounts to cool stiffness. I believe it all boils down to one's view of Chopin's music, essentially whether it is seen as literal and objective ('unromantic'), or rather as flexible and subjective ('romantic'). I fully belong to the latter camp and thence find limited pleasure in Pollini's approach--though acknowledging the influence his playing has had on future generations of pianists (not least Yundi Li).<br /><br />Chopin's music was my first love affair in music as a young boy learning to play the piano; more than two decades on I have had the opportunity of listening to the vast majority of pianists having recorded Chopin since [[ASIN:B000026OW3 Rubinstein's]] and [[ASIN:B000002SBV Cortot's]] epochal mono recordings of the interwar period. Prior to Pollini, it is fair to say that few, if any, notable pianists played Chopin other than romantically (in the case of Cortot, it could almost be added 'approximately'). One can read that Chopin, like most composers, regarded the written score as a kind of formal articulation of a musical idea; for instance, he spent hundreds of hours trying to put down on paper that otherworldly Venetian gondola song he heard in his head, only to arrive at a score of the Barcarolle whose correspondence with his own performances was approximate at best (according to preserved written accounts). Consequently, to me it is obvious that the written score must be interpreted with individual inspiration in order for the music to be realised.<br /><br />If I was to generally describe Pollini's way of interpreting Chopin, I would call it literal, inflexible, monochromatic and one-dimensional: most contrasts in tempo, dynamics and phrasing are equalised; the result is brilliant, immaculate and magisterial, as if the score was used as a blueprint for musical serial production. For many listeners, this seems to be more than enough--they do not want any intrusive elements of 'mannerism', 'schmaltz' or 'idiosyncrasy'. My reaction to Pollini's Chopin has always been a feeling of being shortchanged, as his delivery could be most closely likened to non-interpretations.<br /><br />This brings us to the other main issue of whether Pollini's Chopin playing has remained consistent over the years, here spanning from 1972 to 2008 as recorded by DG. I think it is quite evident that his approach has remained pretty much unchanged, not only during the mentioned period but also including the 1960s with his 'classic' [[ASIN:B003YCRY14 debut recording]] on EMI. However, conversely to most other pianists, Pollini's Chopin has not mellowed with age; instead, if anything, his keystroke has become fiercer, rubato sparser and tempos even more restless. There are a couple of interesting reference points for comparison, where there are two versions of the same work recorded with a considerable amount of time elapsed in between: the First Ballade sounded relatively conventional with some careful rubato in the 1960 EMI recording (8:58), whereas the 1999 remake is unequivocally dramatic and bare (8:35); the Second Ballade was tense enough in 1999 (6:51), only to become disturbingly impatient in the 2008 remake (6:29); Nocturnes Nos 4-5 and 7-8 came out straightforward but poised in 1960, turning blunt and hectic in 2005; the Second Sonata from 1984 may be my favourite Chopin performance from Pollini, appropriately large-scale and forceful, whereas the 2008 remake is uncomfortably tight.<br /><br />At the other side of the spectrum, Ohlsson was brilliant but comparatively straightforward in his early Chopin playing from the 1970s--revealing little of the level of depth and reflective beauty that were to elevate his complete survey on Arabesque (recorded 1989-2000) tounequalled reference quality. The most interesting comparison to draw is in the greatest of the Nocturnes, in C minor (Op 48/1): [[ASIN:B0007RO55W 5:49]] as opposed to 7:58 tells a great deal of the increased elegiac poetry and suppleness of the remake. Even more interesting is to compare Ohlsson's two versions with Pollini's, taken at a breathless 5:09 which allows little room for any sense or retrospection or poetry. In fact, the Nocturnes are the works that most clearly expose Pollini's shortcomings in Chopin, as seen from the 'romantic' camp perspective. Of bel canto (Op 9/2), intimacy (Op 9/1), nostalgia (Op 62/1) and dusky sonorities (Op 27/1) we get little with Pollini's fierce and often blunt aggressiveness (Op 32/1), virtually deprived of rubato (Op 37/1) and true pianissimo (Op 27/2).<br /><br />Pollini has recorded only four Mazurkas for DG (another three can be found in his 1960 competition programme), and it is not hard to understand why: try the simple C major (Op 33/3) or the greatest of the pack in B minor (Op 33/4), neither of which I have heard played with such stiffness and unidiomatic perception of the Polish national dance. Against that backdrop, the worst disc in the set is the third one containing the mature Polonaises, where Pollini's playing is a combination of lifeless and edgy (Op 26), fierce and bare (Op 40), harsh and percussive (Op 44), and unheroic and distantly observed (Opp 53 & 61). The Etudes and Preludes are largely characterised by steely technical brilliance, harsh tone production and arctic grey-scale colours. It should be mentioned that DG's close-up, airless piano sonics adds to the tinny sound quality.<br /><br />Pollini's unsentimental, unstylised and blunt playing works best in the more large-scale works, above all the Scherzos (except No 4), the Ballades (chiefly Nos 1 & 2) and the Second Sonata (from 1984). But what this 9-disc box set, featuring the bulk of Chopin's music for solo piano (excluding most of the Mazurkas, the early Polonaises, three Impromptus, four Rondos, the First Sonata and several one-off works), ultimately displays is that Pollini and Chopin was a brilliant match made in theory that just never worked very well in practice. Since I believe the half-a-century-old debut recording remains his most successful Chopin outing, I find the pending [[ASIN:B005OJD8JM Testament release]] of the Etudes, recorded by EMI in September 1960 but previously unpublished, to be of greater interest.<br /><br />REFERENCE: [[ASIN:B001F4YGUA Ohlsson]]nteresting comparison to draw is in the greatest of the Nocturnes, in C minor (Op 48/1): [[ASIN:B0007RO55W 5:49]] as opposed to 7:58 tells a great deal of the increased elegiac poetry and suppleness of the remake.

B004LROUW2|3.0|I am a big fan of Murakami, but this one did not give the usual thrill of others I have read. I still enjoyed his writing and finished the book. Just not my favorite.
1439163146|1.0|I was recommended this book by a friend and because I love James Franco as an actor and heard about all the degrees he's been getting at the prestigious universities he's attended, so I decided to give it a read. Worst decision of the year. He's no Oscar Wilde that's for sure, but he's not even Stephanie Meyer! These stories are pointless and boring. I would expect just a little more from someone who's as educated as him. I'm 18, I admire James Franco and I still don't like them. You can't say that younger readers will get a better experience out of it because most people in my hall have tried to read it and they can't get passed the first couple of stories without being bored to tears. I get his angle, but it's just not working.  And with the recent news of Franco getting a professor fired for giving him a D in a class and then publicly humiliating him for it, I'm almost positive that most of those \\"rave reviews\\" came from his pocket someway.  Stick to acting Franco, don't let writing tarnish your reputation.
0596007124|5.0|As with most Head-First books it allows you for a fun, yet comprehensive learning of the subject. Also great if you want to refresh your knowledge of some things you haven't worked in lately.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am very pleased with the ease of use.  Good options, explainations simple.  If one had never played before they would easily learn.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Great album.  As always, powerful vocals belting out lyrics that tell complex stories with beautiful poetry.  All of which is backed by pounding beats.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I have this on my kindle fire. Was working good then started freezing up on me during play.  I hope it was a fluke.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|great fun.  plays almost identically to xbox version.  very enjoyable time killer.  I have actually replayed a couple of times.  definitely recommended.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|We went and saw this with the kids twice.  There aren't any huge stars in it.. and the story is sort of 'cheesy'  -  nevertheless the movie was just an awesome experience.  Everything you'd want in a sci-fi movie at the theater.  I'm sending this to my grandfather for Christmas.  He loves sci-fi and doesn't like a lot of gratuitous stuff in movies.  This is a great family flick and a fun movie to watch.
B000GIXLO8|5.0|I love this movie series. The extended versions add quite some time to the already @3 hours of the theatrical versions. I would only recommend this for true lovers of the trilogy due to this. The extended scenes are just as beautiful and fully edited as the rest of the film. If you are buying The Two Towers: Extended Version make sure you buy the other two as well...<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000067DNF The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Four-Disc Special Extended Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000634DCW The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]]
B005KJZDXK|3.0|I have to say I was mightily under-whelmed by this album.<br /><br />There is no denying that Zooey can hold a tune, some times she is even a great singer, but there is something about this album that gets under my skin. It might be the license she takes with syncopation, it might be how she changes the words of classic Christmas songs...<br /><br />I really wanted to like this album, but I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy it.<br /><br />Please, do yourself a favor, and go and buy a TRUE Christmas classics album.
