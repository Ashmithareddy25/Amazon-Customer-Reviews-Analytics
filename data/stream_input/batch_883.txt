B001EOQWF8|5.0|I cannot understand how Pixar's crown jewel and masterpiece is the lowest ranking of all their nine films so far on Amazon as of right now (05/20/2009).     The Toy Story movies are my personal favorites, but from a technical aspect, Wall-E is Pixar's greatest film to date and it is really one of the best films of the last decade. So why then does Pixar's Cars have 4 1/2 stars, yet Wall-E only has 4? Granted, 4 stars is a great ranking, but its not at fitting for Wall-E. This movie should have an average of 5 stars, but Wall-E should definately have at least a 4 1/2 star ranking on here.     I don't know. I guess I would ask that if you feel the same way, could you go to the trouble of ranking this movie with 5 stars if you haven't already so we can get this averaged out? Please.

B001EOQWEO|5.0|This movie was absolutely hilarious and well thought out.  How many movies without dialogue could be just as intriguing?  None, IMO.  I find this to be a message to humans, as well.  Humans are such CONSUMERS of life, it wouldn't surprise me that we'd end up like that in the future.  This just displayed the message in a more subtle, ironically and funny way.  Let it be known to the uneducated in regards to the history of animation, animation was produced specifically for adults back in the day during the war.  They were shown with the news in the theaters - mostly for comic relief during such a depressing time.  Can't think of a better reason than to turn to animation again due to the recession.  Many animations produced today, as well, are with the adult in mind - think Japanese Animation.  Animation: Not just for kids.     That said, it was funny and one of the best Pixar films... although, can't think of any Pixar I dislike.  If you like the short (layman's terms: SHORT cartoon before film), I highly recommend purchasing the Pixar Shorts!  By far my favorite!
B001RIY4WE|1.0|I have a machine that's only a few months old-- the SONY BDP-350, and I can't play the damn disc, just like some other people are gradually beginning to discover the hard way. My player has performed perfectly for me up to now, even playing other discs which have also been reported to be problematic. Just to be sure it wasn't a damaged disc, I returned it and tried a second one- same trouble.    The movie will not play and I can't get past the STUDIO CANAL logo. Supposedly some of us are required to do a 2.0 Firmware Update, and I've been told that even after doing THAT it may not work. I think this is a disgrace, and I'm not thrilled with the idea of having to go crazy doing firmware upgrades and God only knows what else (someone said the Sony player also requires a \\"memory slide\\" or something??). Screw that - I shouldn't have to jump through a dozen hoops and mazes just to get a movie to play. I'm going back to the store and am demanding a refund. Lionsgate will hear an earful from me for pulling this kind of \\"internet connect\\" crap. I just want to watch the damn movie in my living room on my HDTV without the net!!      This is a headache none of us need. There are a lot of DVD people sitting on the fence who are afraid to get into Blu-ray for reasons just like this, and this isn't helping Blu-ray's reputation at all. What the hell is all this garbage lately that everything has to be \\"internet capable\\"??     I'll stick with my old standard DVD \\"Ultimate Edition\\" in the metal silver casing -- at least it PLAYS - and it's got not one, not two, but THREE versions of the film.

B00150B2SS|5.0|I read \\"The spy who came from the cold\\" a while ago and  liked a lot. This was my second Le Carre.    I felt more or less the same when I read \\"The Sound and Fury\\". The narrative just flows. Pure stream of consciousness. Each word is essential and it is up to the reader to grasp the meanings and digest the data. It is one of these books that deserves to be read a few times.     The real spy is the reader. I don't mean that  is up for the reader to solve the puzzle in the traditional best-seller way. I knew the mole's identity. When I was reading the book, I browsed an article on Wikipedia and for my surprise it gave away the mole's identity without a spoiler notice. In reality, this is secondary.      Most actions are described in interviews. Smiley asks some questions to someone and this person  responds. We know the facts from these dialogues. I enjoyed the colloquialism of the conversations. Very British. Everybody is straight to the point. Work environment is political and dysfunctional as any real work environment.    My impression is that many of these characters were introduced on previous books and Le Carre took for granted that the reader knew them. That was not my case and things were a little hazy in the first few chapters.

B0013D8LOK|4.0|I saw Sweeney Todd in March of 1979 in preview on Broadway.  I sat in the second row-so I got to see all the gore up close. I was mesmorized and couldn't get it out of my head for months.  The only problem was that Angela Lansbury clearing wasn't up to the part in terms of the singing requirements of the role-but I loved her anyway.  Victor Garber played Anthony in a stiff manner, and the girl who played Joanna was such a dear thing you wanted to choke her.  I kept waiting for her to \\"get it\\" from \\"Dad\\".  I still LOVED the show.  Now the movie:  okay, HB Carter CANNOT sing, although she has a goth creepiness to her that Angela didn't. The latter was way more cockney and much funnier in the part--loony funny.  I give this only 4 stars because of Bonham-Carter.  Johnny was a much better S.T. than Len Cariou, who looked like an a-hole with that wig on-(he also had problems vocally) but Johnny is the perfect Sweeney.  Not that his voice is all that great either but he simply has the sex appeal that the other schlub lacked and thus provided a rationale why Mrs. Lovett was so crazy about him.  He also looks terrific with his makeup and that white streak in the hair.  A few problems:  the \\"God That's Good\\" number-which opened the second act was much better on the stage-and was more interesting in that this was the moment when the barber chair arrived and was tested. And unfortunately the ending of the movie is weak--where the hell is \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\\" which opened and closed the play?  This ending is too abrupt and drab (the film would have grossed 10 million more with the stage ending)-did Tim Burton think it was too \\"theatrical\\"--but what's more theatrical that this show?      Additionally I loved the voice of the kid who played Toby--he was better than Ken Jennings' stage Toby and much younger and more workhouse convincing.  The stage Toby was portrayed as retarded and was a lot older.  I loved the astonishing production design of the film and the marvellouscostumes and of course let's not forget Borat himself as Pirelli-just marvelous in this small part.
B001UREJWM|1.0|First Queensryche drops an incredibly boring album and now Dio/Sabbath.  Now I expected it from Queensryche.  Their last several albums have been pretty dull, not as dull as their newest, but dull none the less.  Dio on the other hand has at least managed a few pretty good songs per album, even on his weaker albums.  If you've heard the new material from Sabbath's the dio years that's a pretty good example of what to expect, except those songs while not particularly great blow most of these tunes out of the water.      The album is mostly slow and plodding, as many have mentioned.  There's no life, no energy.  There's nothing to make me want to come back and listen to it again and again.  I could hardly distinguish one song from the next.  There are just no hooks at all.  Most every song follows the same pace.  Imagine the weakest Dio songs to come out over the past fifteen years or so, and that's this album.    Dio sounds fine.  Sure his voice isn't as good as it was on Holy diver, but he still has a good voice.  His voice has survived much better than others, Robert Plant, Ozzy, to name a couple.  The band plays competantly enough, despite the lack of creativity.      The only songs I found somewhat worth keeping are Bible black-still pretty overrated, but at least it has an acoustic intro which gives it something different, still slow and plodding, Rock n'roll angel-again slow and plodding but slightly better than the rest, and Double the pain-which is one of the few faster songs on the album.  The chorus makes me laugh because it reminds me of the old double mint gum comercials.  Still it's a decent song, and probably my favorite on the album.    Still none of those songs reach great, really good, or even good status.  They're just alright.  I'd go into more detail, but they don't deserve it.    Overall unless you're a huge Dio fan, or a huge Sabbath fan, there's no need to buy this one.  Download it for a listen if you must, but I wouldn't pay money for this.What happened to the great bands?  Priest last year, Sabbath and Queesnsryche this year.  I've only heard a couple of songs off Saxon's new cd, but just those two have more energy and life and are vastly superior songs to anything off this or Queensryche's new releases.  Also Hammerfall's new cd is pretty good, although I wouldn't recomend that to be your first Hammerfall cd.  Bottom line, thee are far better  cd's to spend your money on than this, but if you must it's your money.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|If you ever had any doubts about whether to see this movie or not, I urge you to set them aside and rent it. It isn't an easy movie to watch, but the performances are brilliant in every respect and the screenplay is possibly one of the best constructed I have seen in a very long time, perhaps because it is based on Shanley's play of the same name which enjoyed a long theatrical run.<br /><br />Set in 1964 in the Bronx, New York, the movie centers on Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), the tough as nails principal of St. Nicholas school and her suspicions that the charismatic new priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), has taken too personal an interest in a young African American boy under his tutelage.  Though it is never spoken aloud, Beauvier is convinced that Flynn is sexually abusing the boy.  Thus the conflict begins as Beauvier searches for proof to confirm what she absolutely knows in her heart to be true and comes head to head with Flynn.<br /><br />Streep is brilliant as the old battle axe of a nun who is desperately trying to do the right thing.  Never once does she falter.  Never once does she doubt what Flynn is doing to the boy.  Or does she?  Streep plays this woman on many levels: the terror that she is to her students, a woman who enjoys her position of power but tries to be even handed in the meting out of discipline.  She is also a woman wholly devoted to the school and church, seeing that their solemn duty is to teach and guide these children, to protect them.  It is a multifaceted performance, resonant for anyone who had a scary nun as their principal during childhood.<br /><br />Hoffman as Flynn gets every beat right.  He oozes charisma as the priest trying to \\"modernize\\" the church by being more a friend to the children than a mentor or disciplinarian.  He is gregarious and approachable and charming, but when Streep turns her sights on him, one sees the danger and vindictiveness and manipulation that lies beneath the facade he presents to the world. You see the darkness inside him that makes you believe he was doing exactly what he is suspected of doing.<br /><br />Shanley also gets the entire abuse dynamic exactly right.  Like many priestly perpetrators, Flynn drifts toward the student who needs a friend the most...the outsider, the odd duck in the school:  the sole African American boy amongst a sea of pasty white faces.  Shanley shows us Flynn \\"grooming\\" the boy, drawing him in.  Shanley plants the seeds that Flynn very well could be sexually molesting the boy.  The other aspect that is completely spot on how these perpetrators justify their \\"closeness\\" with their kids as trying to modernize the church, trying to humanize it and become more friend than anything else.  The result is a performance by Hoffman that is charming in every way and intensely creepy and dirty.<br /><br />Viola Davis as the young boy's mother turns in an Oscar worthy performance as well as a woman who just doesn't want to know or is willing to look the other way with respect to what may be happening to her little boy.  Believe it or not, back in 1964 (and in some respects, still today) this was a very, very common reaction.  Close your eyes and it never happened.  Brilliant performance and completely realistic.<br /><br />The sole clink in this otherwise fine film is Amy Adams as Sister James, the newest nun whose naivete allows her first to suspect Flynn and then turn away from those foul thoughts when he offers the flimsiest of excuses.  The role really serves very little purpose in the film as portrayed by Adam, whose performance is whiny and one note. I found her annoying from the start and I longed for her scenes to be over quickly.<br /><br />As to whether Flynn did molest the boy or not...well, you'd have to see the movie.  One moment you'll think yes, and then next you'll think no.  That's the nature of Doubt and the question which is placed before every survivor of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest...prove it.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.

B000BQ7BX2|5.0|I have heard, and own, most of the Mahler cycles and I can say without hesitation that this set with Gary Bertini and the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra is one of the best, most consistent sets in my collection. I own all but two Mahler cycles and I rank this one up there with my other favorites: Abbado, Chailly, Rattle, and Tennstedt. When I listen to a complete cycle I look for consistency. I know not every set is going to be perfect. Some interpretations are better than others, etc., but these performances are incredibly solid from start to finish.<br /><br />The Cologne Radio Symphony may not be a Berlin Philharmonic or a Royal Concertgebouw (who is?), but this orchestra proves itself and should be rewarded for outclassing many of the other orchestras that surround them. I'm still waiting to hear a Munich Philharmonic cycle one day.<br /><br />I was particular impressed with the way Bertini handled Symphony Nos. 5, 6, & 9, which are my favorite Mahler symphonies, so for me, these are the true highlights of this box.<br /><br />If you're thinking of owning a Mahler symphony cycle please consider these fine performances.  Highly recommended.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Excellent film - Highly recommended - 5 stars - do I make my point?  This film is amazing; full of action; full of exciting, ironic twists; and reminds a person of the book 1948.    Scary though in that it is a mirror of what the recent Department of Homeland Security report said -- anyone not agreeing with the current government is a danger to society.  The original report (as of recent the websites I have seen are watering it down after public outcry - or putting their own words in it to make the position of the document seem less offensive) labels these people as terrorists - read it!  It is there in black and white!  The report specifically mentions veterans as being potential terrorists!  Again - try to find the original copy online - recently the websites are watering it down after public outcry.    In Equilibrium, the personal thoughts and opinions of the individual are seen as a threat to the government head - called \\"The Father.\\"  This leads to the imprisonment of those who do not agree with the established system.     Equilibrium presents us with a fictional society where emotion (hence private opinion as to what is best) is required to be sacrificed by individuals for the (government defined) public good.  This film is a fictional, but harsh glimpse at what history has proven socialism always evolves into.  The reason history has absolutely no record of a non-evil socialistic society is shown in portrayed here.  Mankind has an inherent sense of greed and selfishness.  Therefore, when an authoritative figure is set up to become the entity to distribute everyone's private goods among all society (socialism) - for a state of equilibrium - the fact that, \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" rears its ugly head.    The \\"father\\" in this film is so very typical of what \\"absolute corruption\\" results in: the \\"Father\\" forces his opinions on the masses, and (as in all recorded, historical instances) - allows only himself (and immediate friends) the very privileges he denies the citizens!  The parallelism of this film - although a fictional world not yet existing - to historical accuracy is an amazing parallel to witness.    Equilibrium also accurately defines the human emotions of greed and selfishness to be the cause of war.  However, as seen here, these - always- are also the basis of evil regimes that kill their own citizens!  What a paradox!  This film accurately does show the way to combat these evils is NOT to sacrifice the rights of the individual and \\"spread the wealth around\\" b/c when individuality is lost, then existence becomes nothing but a play-toy for the few who wield the authority.  The citizens become puppets living only gratify the indulgences of the privileged few.     Get it - watch it - feel it - learn from it - be entertained by it - but do not let the truth behind this enjoyable film slip through your fingers.  No wonder I heard so very little about this film in the news media!
6305128952|5.0|This is conceivably my favorite movie of all time, and definitely my favorite soundtrack.  There is so much more to this film than I've seen anyone write.  Sure it's a romance, horse, child loving horse, injured child (mentally and physically), horsey guy, etc. and whatever else you've read about this movie.  But what I'll attempt to write here is what you're not going to see anywhere else.<br /><br />My personal favorite dynamic in human to human or human to animal relationships is the garnering of trust. And someone, or both, having that intuition to be such that they earn that trust. This is what you have in this movie.  Some spoilers may be involved here...<br /><br />Kristen Scott Thomas' character is ill - on the fast track professionally and away from a quality marriage.  Some might call that success and indeed her character was so caught up in her life that she probably thought she was doing fine. Scarlette Johannson's character is ill as well - both physically and mentally from the accident and from a lack of true connection to her parents, especially her mother. The horse is, well, broken - physically, of course, but traumatized from the accident.<br /><br />These three come to beautiful, clean and pristine (but not over-the-top gorgeous - as I've heard Redford say that he wanted the landscape to speak for itself -intrinsic beauty - not from the photography making it beautiful - paraphrased here) country and they meet Robert Redford's character. He is so peacefully understanding of what these other three are about - he takes stock of the mother (all New York of her), the horse (traumatized) and the girl (resistent and hurting).  He presents himself in such a way that he is totally non-threatening and they all, on their own levels, come to trust him...and they heal.<br /><br />It is a movie about trust. There are prices to pay for that trust, for sure. Redford's character opens up in a way he never thought he would again but I like how this director ended the movie rather than how the book ended.  The book ending made no sense in the context of who the character was so I appreciate that Redford changed it. The mother pays a price for sure....the horse and the girl...well, they're healed and all is right with their world..<br /><br />There are many levels on which to watch this movie - the photography is gorgeous, the horses, the way of life - all beautiful....the music, well, gorgeous and grandiose in parts....the characters multi-level....The husband (Sam Neill)is intelligent and shows he has a good understanding of how his marriage is and the changes his wife has gone through while with Redford. It's a tear-jerker for sure - I don't think as many times as I've watched this movie, that I haven't been crying at the end. But I hate to see it end....Enjoy this movie - I envy you the first time.book ended.  The book ending made no sense in the context of who the character was so I appreciate that Redford changed it.

B0001RVTXO|4.0|Somehow I missed the Pixies.  Maybe it was growing up in the Midwest in the 80s and being subject to classic rock stations galore.  In any case, wondering who the band was that influenced so many 90s artists, I had to check them out.  For my primer, I bought this greatest hits collection.  Usually, it takes a few listens to find my favs in the album.  Coming from the place of not knowing which songs were the \\"popular ones\\" is always a fun experience.  However, I did begin to recognize songs I had heard over the years, either placed in movies/tv or casually on the radio - more so than I expected.  Ones that stuck out for me were: Hey!, Gigantic, Gouge Away, Where Is My Mind.  Love how this collection starts off with the total Garage Band sound and develops into the more polished (but not over-polished) production sound.

B000025RHI|5.0|Along with Bunny Wailer's Blackheart Man and Culture's Two Sevens Clash, The Heart of the Congos represents one of the monumental summits of reggae music.<br /><br />This is 70s reggae at its most complex, haunting and deeply heavy best.  Ethereal falsetto harmonies, chanting background vocals from a chorus including Gregory Isaacs, guitar by Ernest Ranglin all amount to the perfect primer to both the glory days of Jamaican roots music and the peculiar genius of producer Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry.  Perry drew up the blueprint for dub reggae in the cauldron of his legendary Black Ark studio.  This album is considered to be the masterpiece of Perry's Black Ark years.<br /><br />As good as this is, it must be said that the one-CD version currently sold by VP records is highly inferior to the remastered two-cd, now out of print, Blood and Fire version.  Seek out the Blood and Fire version due to the expanded number of tracks it contains, including gems such as \\"Solid Foundation\\" and \\"At the Feast\\" as well as the vastly better sound quality.  I am far from an audiophile, but the VP version sounds muddy whereas the Blood and Fire version sounds crisp and clean -- the instruments distinct.<br /><br />If it becomes impossible to find the Blood and Fire version used, the VP version may suffice, but it would be a shame to see such a shining work not presented in its full luster.
B001V7YWTQ|4.0|This is a difficult CD to critique. On one hand, Eric's playing and Steve's singing are at levels now at ages 64 and 61 respectively, where they have matured like fine wines. Although always of strong voice, Winwood sings with a sophistication and an interpretive sensibility now that he's never had before.  The richness in his voice is magnificent. And Clapton..... I can't believe the energy and the shear power in his vocals and in his playing. Some of his solos on this set are more prolific than in his Dominoes days over 35 Years ago. However, there are a couple of down sides to this CD. One, Clapton tends to overplay and go for the easy speed riff too many times in this set instead of really covering new ground as a still vital artist. Too many times Winwood is left to continously comp changes for Clapton's, in some cases, endless doodling. However, when Clapton is spot on like he is with readings of Hendrix classics Voodoo Chile and Little Wing, he is truly as good as he's ever been.  Winwood is too often set in the background although his vocals are strong and his playing masterful. There are some additional treats, such as them playing the majority of the Blind Faith release together for the first time since 1970! All in all this is a fine effort that will make long-time fans smile at the resilience and passion of both of these artists, but a little more imaginative set list and a more equal staging of both of these icon's considerable talents would have been more appreciated.  Still, give it four stars for the truly amazing performances on more than a few of these numbers and the power that both of these greats bring to the stage after more than 40 years in Rock.

I had downloaded it to my Kindle based on the number of 5 star reviews, and I kept plodding through thinking that it might somehow justify at least one of those 117 5 star reviews.  No such luck.  The characters remain as flat and unbelievable at the end as they are in the first 10 pages.  The scariest thing is that Smith has written a sequel, with the protagonist Leo back at it again in Moscow.  Spare me.
1423101472|5.0|I have to say, first, that I love, love, love this book. It was very well-written, and anyone can enjoy this. It's full of action, mystery, and keeps you turning the page. Everyone at my middle school was reading it between classes (and sometimes during classes!) the first week when it came out. It sews up all of the loose ends nicely and has a satisfying ending.    As much as I love it, I do have one complaint about the book - and the rest of the series. Percy and his friends seem to get by everything a little too easily. I mean, sure, he's faced difficulties, and people have died, but it seems like more people would die if an army of Titans and monsters were after you.    But even so, I still recommend it to anyone looking for a great book full of action and adventure. Definitely worth 5 stars!

0765322889|3.0|I guess I'll start by saying that I really wanted to like this book - it seemed to have lots of potential - but in the end I was disappointed. Oh, I'm sure some of it was related to the hype (lots of positive reviews, on a few \\"top 10\\" lists) but that is not all of it, not by far. And to be fair, I did enjoy the first half or 2/3 of the book, but by the end I was kinda ready for it to be done. To be a little more specific, I think the author had some good ideas. Unfortunately he is lacking as a storyteller.     What I had originally thought of as several different flaws in the book I now think are all related to the author's inability (or unwillingness) to give much detail or context about what is going on. He writes scenes sort of as-they-happen, with no analysis, but then he generally fails to connect them or explain them in a way that helps you understand why so and so is doing whatever. That and his general lack of description has several major repercussions for the work.    1) The author drops you straight into the story. One short prologue and thats it. Ok, that can work, provided things are filled in along the way. But none of his characters ever stops to ask character X why he is pissed at character Y. You are left with the fact that they hate each other and there is no backstory filled in. You never know why the Empress wants so badly to purge certain groups. You never know why some ancient race has been \\"recalled\\" from the dead and how that fits the Empire's plans. In some cases you can guess, but you rarely find out if your suspicions are correct. I'm willing to give a little in that with a series you won't get all your answers in one book, but the almost complete lack of backstory or dropping of substantial clues is very frustrating.    2) Environment descriptions - things tend to be basic, you get a general drift but places lack the feel of a richer work. His real weakness though is with the people - what they look like, how they physically respond, etc. As a result you don't get a good visual portrait of the characters. Occasionally a little tidbit will drop, for example 2/3 of the way through you find out one of the central characters has a beard. Erickson has populated his world with several non-human races as well, but you wouldn't know this from his minimal descriptions. In fact there is nothing (with perhaps one exception) so far described - not that there is much to start with -  that isn't within the realm of normal human variation. The only way you know they aren't human is because they are flagged as such in the book's glossary. They might as well just be different cultural groups because species differences certainly don't come into play.     3) Characters - I could go on and on about little things but I'll simply say that most are pretty flat and tend to run together. I don't mind large ensemble casts but there were few distinguishing features here. Most everyone is world-weary and apparently incurious as to what is happening around them. The few attempts at character development are undermined by the author's lack of backstory/motivation for his characters.     4) Stuff just happens (and isn't explained, surprise surprise). There is a boss battle at the end which has several examples which for brevity I'll list only two: a) One mage in the battle suddenly unleashes 7 different types of magic. Every other mage presented in the book (including the \\"gods/ascendants\\") apparently can manage only one. Other mages are impressed. No explanation given, not even what spells were released. b) Bad bosses' hidden magic goodie suddenly grows into a weird tree which is countered/absorbed by some other magic goodie/being that has never been referenced before and is explained by simply saying \\"it is drawn to the unjust use of power\\". I kid you not - that is the entire explanation of the event.    Sooo, I've been a bit harsh... but I give this book 3 out of 5 stars. I almost gave it two because of the poor writing, butbecause I did sort of enjoy a good chunk of it and there was some fun stuff to think about with regard to magic and the \\"ascendants\\" (even if the author was unwilling to help you along in this regard) so I somewhat grudgingly bumped it up to three. And I guess that is appropriate, as overall it balances out to being a pretty average book. If Erikson was a better storyteller I'd be all over this series, but as it stands maybe I'll give him another book or two and see if the story starts to shape up. Or perhaps more importantly, to see if Erikson improves as a writer. In any case, I'm not rushing out to get the second book. Maybe if I see it used...
B000V6984M|3.0|\\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\" is ostensibly the anthemic tale of a succubus in angels' garb taking advantage of a mullet clad bohunk. \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" instantly seduces with its opening riff. (What instrument is that?!) Presumably our two main characters' narrative continues here in an unlikely New Jersey love story. In \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" Mr. Bon Jovi ditches the star crossed lovers for a classic Western motif. I dare you to find a more infectious 12-string riff. That he references a 6-string in the song only adds to the mystery. The rest of this album is garbage, but these three tunes keep it floating above the poop.
B00009YUPY|4.0|Unfortunately Lenovo has taken over production of this mouse, so it doesnt have the IBM logo.  But other than that, it is a good mouse.  The red scroll wheel has a rubbery texture--not hard plastic.  The wheel is a bit stiff and clicks into place solidly when turned.  Though it does have a barely audible click when pushed forward (not when pulling back), but I definitely prefer a stiffer wheel than a loose one.  The optical tracking is excellent.  I have a good mouse pad with a wrist rest that I like to use, but it is solid black.  This mouse has no trouble tracking over the pad, while I have had trouble with some optical mice in the past.  This was my biggest concern and it passed perfectly. 4/5 for not having the IBM logo, but would definitely recommend the product.
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|The Eagles had 14 years to get over themselves and put all the pettiness behind them that originally drove them apart. That said, it is absolutely amazing that a group can be apart for so long and put on a performance such as this. It's as if they had never been apart. Gorgeous harmonies, beautiful music and lyrics - it's all here. Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh, Timothy B. Schmit and Don Felder were all in their prime and look fantastic. The new songs are good - the most memorable being \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive.\\" The classics are there too, including a beautiful new acoustic version of \\"Hotel California\\" and an absolutely knock 'em dead version of \\"Take It Easy\\" with a fab guitar solo courtesy of Mr. Walsh.  Some of the songs are a bit slow or obscure (\\"Pretty Maids All in a Row\\"), but when they get going, they really get going. The sound is also quite impressive for a live concert. This is a must-have for Eagles fans and fans of music in general.

0765317389|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time.  I am just a bit annoyed at the confusing product title.  I thought I was getting all four books and thus was a bit lost when only one arrived.  Checking back showed that the mistake was mine, but they really should make it clearer that you are only getting the one book.  Judging by the other reviews, I am not the only one to make the mistake.    Still, this is a great book and a good price for it.

0670020478|5.0|I have had the privilege of attending several of Sir Ken's speaking engagements (yes, he's that good), and I must say that The Element is \\"required reading\\" to those of us who follow this influential thought leader.  If you haven't heard Sir Ken speak, then all the more reason to own this book.
0156027321|5.0|I listened to it (unabridged) from Audible.  Both I and my kids have enjoyed it, although I think I got more out of it than they did.  They were 9 and 11 at the time.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|\\"Amazing Grace\\" was a movie that made my husband and me want to work with zeal and persistence in our life pursuits for good!  The fact that this was a true story made it even more meaningful.  The characters were excellent, as was the setting and entire quality of the film.  The movie was an exciting drama that we will watch again and again.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|I will share that part of my disappointment may have been that the film toted itself as \\"How the song Amazing Grace came to be\\". Not really what the film was about. While the song was penned and tuned during this time, the film is actually about William Wilberforce and his decades long struggle to abolish the British slave trade. The song is mentioned and it's author is a pivotal figure in the film, but it's not the main focus. I thought this film took an interesting look as Wilberforce's life and the relationships formed that inspired and supported Wilberforce during his quest. The movie jumps quite a bit between two periods with a sort-of \\"flashback\\" mentality. I found it a bit difficult to keep up with the concepts and am not sure it was a useful tool within this story. I learned more of the \\"players\\" during this period of abolition and am looking forward to researching their stories. The acting is fabulous.    *For parents: I believe you could watch this with children even as young as elementary age. However, the jumping back & forth between time periods may be confusing for younger viewers. Be prepared, there some graphic descriptions/depictions of what slaves endured especially as it pertained to traveling from Africa on the ships.
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|It takes a while to figure out what exactly \\"The Reader\\" is about. Teenage boy by chance meets older woman who apparently has no existence outside of work. At first they have sex, and after the third go-round get around to finding out what each other's name is. Then she wants him to read to her. So life goes as follows: Sex and reading, then reading and sex.  Only he does all the reading. She is also a bit touchy and self-conscious, for reasons beyond the boy's understanding, and causes him pain. He loves her, but why? The only thing they share is sex and books, and then there is the age difference.          Then one day she inexplicably disappears. The next time we see her she is in a courtroom, being charged as a Nazi war criminal. He is part of a law school seminar, ostensibly to study the psychology of mass murder. At a crucial moment he is in a position to help her, but at the last moment turns away. Why? But then again, he is distant from family, friends, his own daughter. Why?        One day he finds books that he had once read to her, and decides to spend hours of his free time making cassette recordings which he mails to her while she is prison, without informing her prior. Why? He never visits her. Why? She learns to write brief notes which she mails to him, but he never responds in spite of her entreaties. Why? When he finally visits her when summoned, as her only known contact, to help her adjust to the world on her release, he reacts rather chillily to her obvious delight in seeing him. Why? If he has gone so far out of his way to ease her prison existence, why should he be disappointed in her now?         The subtext of the film is \\"How far would you go to protect a secret?\\" Hanna Schmitz's secret is that she was illiterate. Even for her life she will not reveal that secret. Michael Berg's seems to be that he knows Hanna, but not because of her illiteracy. He never tells anyone--family, friends, anyone until the end--that he knows Hanna, even before he discovers her other past. Strangely, we are given to believe that Hanna's motives are much easier to understand than Michael's.            Not that Hanna deserves our sympathy, or even understanding. Hanna is never bothered by her conscience; she has none. She has a job to do, and she does it by the book--whether it is collecting tram fair or insuring death camp prisoners do not escape from a burning building. Coins or human beings--these are just objects she must collect and distribute. When they  meet for a final time at the end, Michael wants to know what she has \\"learned\\" from the past. \\"The dead are still dead\\" she says. To her the past is past, and should remain in the past. Michael, perhaps to clear his own guilt in even knowing this woman, wants her to say that she knew what she did was wrong, and regrets it. But being the blunt person she is, she can only tell him the truth, which is to say she was only doing her job, and she feels no guilt over that. The seminar professor was wrong: not everyone who kills another human being is aware that it is wrong. Hanna's final \\"will\\" can only be understood in the context of her realization that her relationship with Michael was dead because she was incapable of moral reflection.            The end of the film is supposed to provide \\"catharsis,\\" but there is really none honestly to be had. Michael realizes that he had helped Hanna find some meaning in her life, but his clear disappointment with her at their last meeting rendered it now meaningless to her. But what of that?  Many \\"civilized\\" Germans committed mass murder, even those who appreciated classic literature. The film seeks to force us to empathize with Hanna, just as it forces Michael to realize how \\"wrong\\" he was in his \\"ill\\" treatment of Hanna.            This film actually had forty percent negative reviews, despite its Oscar pedigree. I don't fault the actors, they can only work with what they are given. The biggest problem is that there is very little in the way of exposition. The actors are given surprisingly little useful to say; all too often we have to \\"read\\" their thoughts and expressions to understand what's going on.  Kate Winslet as Hanna does an admirable job of giving us less to guess about; during the trial sequence, we don't need to hear her words to see that she simply doesn't understand what she did wrong.  One can credit Winslet with giving an Oscar-worthy effort, but nevertheless there seems just too many plot holes for her to fill by herself.          David Kross does well enough as the young Michael, but again there are just too many potholes in the story line for him to successfully emote through. What is so empty about his life that he needs to have it filled by a woman twenty years his senior when there are other girls his age who are much more attractive--and who are more interested in him? It can't be sex, because they seem willing enough, and Hanna seems disinterested in him outside the sex and reading, a recipe for a relationship that is headed straight for a dead-end (in spite of declarations of love on his part). The sex scenes themselves are fairly brief and tame; the deleted scenes include the NC-17 material. As the older Michael, Ralph Fiennes is given even less to do, and he comes off the worse for wear.         Given the quality of the deleted scenes, I think a \\"director's cut\\" or \\"unrated\\" version of this film would come off better. The deleted scene in which the young Michael hitchhikes with a former soldier who reveals the blasé mentality of many Germans who murdered Jews was quite effective and would have cleared-up in a major way both the young and older Michael's changing attitude toward Hanna. Inclusion of the sex scenes would have made the younger Michael's incomprehensible fascination with Hanna more believable, and several other scenes would have made plot transitions and character motivations more comprehensible. The film would have been longer, but sometimes plot confusion makes a film seem longer than it actually is.           The Reader is not a film to be dismissed out-of-hand, if only for Winslet's performance. But this is a film that requires the viewer work harder than he or she needs to. \\"What is there to understand?\\" about mass murder, as one character asks.

0930289234|5.0|I never heard of 'WATCHMEN' until I saw a trailer for the movie.  I figured it was good, considering they were making a movie about it after all these years.  Still, it looked to me like a post-apocalyptic alternate reality or something, and since I didn't like V for Vendetta (the movie) I was confused, turned off and uninterested.<br /><br />Then I read a blurb or two explaining the synopsis for it and I was officially intrigued... Super Heroes in the real world, Cold war-era conflict, murder, conspiracy...<br /><br />So I bought the novel, thinking, worse case scenario it sucks and I never watch the movie.<br /><br />Suffice to the say the novel was little to nothing of what I expected... I and f-ing loved it.<br /><br />It is so complex and vast and still retains a feeling of realism.  Moore quickly sets the mood and hits you hard with a compelling plot and characters and never stops.  The art by Gibbons is unique and fascinating.<br /><br />I couldn't put the novel down, I read it straight through in between working and finished it on a flight back home.<br /><br />I found myself drawn into the story, trying to figure out the conspiracy afoot and openly hating and relating to the different characters.  Moore hits so many fronts and an array of psyche's and points of view it is impossible to call this anything other than a masterpiece.<br /><br />The movie did the novel no justice.  It is but a cheap copy and fabrication of an otherwise perfect piece of art.<br /><br />All in all, I am glad I took a chance on the novel.  I will read this novel again and again as often as possible, as a reminder of the genius of Moore and hope that more compelling and rich stories are still to come in the future, by someone, somewhere.

B0016Q2D5M|4.0|This is not a review of the movie itself, but rather of the 3D version designed for home viewing.    First it's important to note that not all versions include the 3D version on the reverse side of the disc. If you're looking for 3D, make sure the version you are buying includes both the 2D and 3D versions. They will both be on a single disc.    Just recently acquiring a Mitsubishi 65\\" 3D-ready DLP HDTV I was quite anxious to start viewing all the home variety 3d programming I could get my hands on.    First I found a couple of movies that I knew my kids would love and made the purchase. First was Spy Kids in 3d, followed by Lava Girl and Shark boy. While there were a few spots (very few) with mediocre 3d effects, all in all I was pretty disappointed with the lack of depth perception, clarity, color, and items that were supposed to 'pop' out at you. On a scale from 1 to 10 for 3d goodness, I'd give each a 3.    Not wanting to give up on home 3d viewing, I searched for another kid friendly 3d movie for home viewing, and wound up ordering Journey to the Center of the Earth.    Now, I haven't watched this with my kids yet, that will be this weekend. But I just completed my pre-viewing - in 3d - and all I can say is WOW!  Unlike the other two movies mentioned above, both of which had you putting on your 3d glasses, then taking them off, then putting them on again, the entire movie here is in 3d. And the 3d effects are good. I mean really good.    Finally I was able to see stuff pop out of the screen at me. And the entire move - all scenes - look as though you are viewing them through a viewmaster. Total depth of scene, along with decent color and clarity. I am so happy to finally have something that will make my 3d hdtv come to life. And that I know my kids are going to love as well!  My advice. If you're looking for a good 3d movie to watch at home, don't miss this one.    The only drawback I've found is that this movie uses their own unique 3d galsses, instead of thecommon red/green variety. Too bad since I own several pair of expensive plastic framed standard anaglyph red/green glasses. So, when watching this movie, we are forced to use the cheap paper glasses that come with it, as no others will work (I've tried).    Still, I highly recommend the movie for it's superb at home 3d effects, and fun, action filled story.
B000002G8J|5.0|I originally bought this album on vinyl soon after its original release and I've always liked it. I was first attracted to the album by Eric's cover of Tulsa time (noticeably different from the equally brilliant original by Don Williams) but the whole album is brilliant. It isn't quite my favorite among Eric's albums (that would be 461 Ocean Boulevard) but it comes close.<br /><br />Supported by Dick Sims (keyboards), Marcy Levy (backing vocals), George Terry (guitar), Carl Radle (bass guitar and backing vocals), Jamie Oldaker (drums, percussion and backing vocals), Eric sings and plays guitar on ten songs, four of which (Watch out for Lucy, Roll it, Tell me that you love me, Golden ring) he wrote or co-wrote. Bob Dylan co-wrote two of the others (Walk out in the rain, If I don't be there by morning) while J J Cale wrote I'll make love to you anytime. Perhaps the best of the lot is Promises (written by Richard Feldman and Roger Linn) while the traditional Early in the morning is another excellent song.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fairly mellow album although the tempo picks up here and there. Other s may tell you that this is not one of Eric's most important albums but it remains one of my favorites.
B00005JPSM|4.0|I'm surprised by the low overall rating on this movie. While it isn't Oscar material, it is certainly better than mediocre. No Reservations doesn't have the goofy factor that many romance movies have, which I appreciate. Instead, this movie quietly develops the characters as we spend time with them. I thought the cast was excellent, and the characters believable. It was a satisfying way to spend a couple of hours.

031606792X|4.0|I have to say I really enjoyed Breaking Dawn. In fact, I think I liked this book out of the whole series. Since there is a plethora of reviews here that probably voice a lot of my own opinion already I'll just say that I really liked this book because all of the characters finally grow up. Most people would say that Bella lives only for Edward, which is primarily true and a lot of Stephanie Meyer's old world values do heavily influence her writing - but then again is that really so bad? Is it so bad for someone to live their life loving someone and having a beautiful family together? Plus, in this book Bella is finally no longer a \\"damsel in distress\\" as she was in the previous books - she is finally self-empowered as a vampire and equal to Edward and all those around her. Getting everything she ever wanted - having it all as a young woman - powerful and being balanced in her home life - I think that's actually a quite modern twist on the gushing romantic parts of the whole series. Overall, I loved it - read it and see for yourself. :-)
079073639X|4.0|Received product quickly with standard shipping.  However, when i tried to play the dvd, it would not load in any of my dvd players, i kept getting a message saying \\"disc error\\".  I notified the company of the issue and they promptly sent out a replacement free of charge with no questions asked and appologized for the problems.  Again i received the product quickly, within a few days and it worked fine.  I don't know what the issue was with the first disk but i did note that the playable side of the first one i'd gotten was a goldish color where as the second one was silver.  So i wonder if i'd gotten a foriegn \\"knock off\\" the first time.  In either case, i appreciate the way the good company handled the issue and acted promptly.
1416562605|4.0|Not your usual Indian novel resplendent with jasmine, bougainvillea, and lyricism outweighing poverty and violence.  This is slum India, and call-center India circa 2008.  This is the India of servants and their bourgeois masters where geography and caste are destiny.  It's not pretty, and it gives me a new perspective for reflecting on the time I spent there with my cooks, housekeepers, and drivers.  Highly recommended for a look from the bottom up - comic, violent, sad.

B000007VCM|4.0|`Love' was a record that many rock fans of various genres could lay claim to as a representative of their style of music. Post punk, alternative, goth and metal followers all saw the Cult as their band and for the mid-eighties, they were fairly unique.  I hated new wave yet the Cult I felt were different in that they rocked harder than the Cure or the Smiths. \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\" wasn't really metal, yet I think metal fans saw it as an acceptable copy of U2 style guitar but with a metal intensity of the band's performance. It was the first song I ever heard from the Cult and it immediately made an impact on me while most songs that came from pasty faced Englishmen had none. \\"Rain\\" and the title track also became instant favorites and listeners realized that the band that made `Dreamtime' was evolving into something much bigger and more interesting. Ian Astbury was on his way to becoming a dominating front man and \\"Love\\" the song had his charisma and talent oozing from every lyric. \\"Big Neon Glitter\\" draws U2 comparisons due to Billy Duffy playing an Edge like guitar but that scream about halfway through gives me goose bumps! \\"Phoenix\\" and \\"Nirvana\\" also rock with intensity especially on the former as Duffy employs the wah-wah pedal to great effect. \\"Revolution\\" is very anthemic and \\"Black Angel\\" closes the record in a melancholy manner but that doesn't make it a poor choice for a closer. `Love' introduced the band to America and its mild success inspired the band to further evolve their sound to become a stadium rock champion with the metal glory that was `Electric'.
1847670946|5.0|In this memoir, Barack Obama traces his journey from the time he was 21 years old. The book begins as, \\"A few months after my twenty-first birthday, a stranger called to give me the news.\\" This was a telephone call from Nairobi informing him of his father's death. This unexpected and unexpected news sparked an emotion odyssey for Obama, leading him to set out to discover the truth of his father's life and reconcile his divided inheritance.<br /><br />This memoir is divided into three parts - Origins, Chicago, Kenya. Each section traces Barack Obama's life; during the early years of his life, his life as an organizer while at Chicago, and then tracing his roots in Kenya.<br /><br />'Dreams from My Father' is surely an unforgettable read. In fact, a must read for people who believe in a change and believe that they can make it happen.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|This movie is a lot of things...it is a comedy, a romance, an adventure, a western, a historical commentary, a social commentary, and a who-dun-it all wrapped up in a shifting vista of scenery.  It also has a good dose of big name stars.  Sadly \\"Australia\\" lacks the power of synergism, and the parts come across as only a portion of what it could have been.<br /><br />After watching this film a few times I was struck by the fact that there is a wealth of possibilities in this story, but none of them was developed compeltely enough to be the central carrying force of the entire show.  It seemed like once a central theme was about to emerge the storyline would shift, and we were off in a different direction.  That was the case with the potential comedic element at the beginning of the show (watch for the scene with the kangaroos...you'll see), the budding romance between two of the main characters, the plight of half-white and half-aboriginal children in 1930s Australia, and the who-dun-it that seemely appeared out of nowhere.<br /><br />Am I glad I watched the show?  Yes, but I don't think that I will be giving it strong recommendations to friends and family.  It's not bad, it's just pretty weak.<br /><br />I think I've got it!  The writers and producers could have developed at least 4 movies from the material included in this one.  For example, the element of the woman of English nobility coming to oversee the the Australian cattle station could be one such story, another could be the who-dun-it (without giving away any spoilers), another could be the bombing of Darwin, northern Australia, another could be the story of the competition for the government army contract for cattle, etc.<br /><br />All in all this film is interesting and fun, but lacking in many ways.<br /><br />3 stars.

B000002KHH|5.0|After so many years, some of the songs on this album seem really played out due to the fact that radio ruined them by playing them so much. Ah, such is the case with all music and how radio sees it, I guess. While I think the debut albums is a bit better, \\"Paranoid\\" still is almost perfect in my opinion. How a band can be this dark and heavy, yet still manage melody thourghout the music and vocals is beyond me. My favorite track off this album is not heavy at all, it's \\"Planet Caravan\\". The spaced out music and the echo-filled vocals are total bliss, making me want to drift off into dreamworld every time I hear it.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|Like several other reviewers, I grew disappointed as I watched the first third of the season.  But again, like most, I feel the show improved with experience, as the writing and the acting matured through the season.    Anna Torv plays a flawed but strong hero--we learn the reasons as the \\"mythology\\" plot line progresses.  The season-ender has multiple revelations that change the viewer's understanding of what was going on beneath the surface all along.    I'm glad I came back to this show and gave it a second chance.    Highly recommended.
B000002KB8|5.0|Black Sabbath's debut is still one of the bets heavy metal albums of all time. There's not a boring spot on the entire album and the whole thing reeks of pure genius. Nothing sounds like this, nothing. It's as if Ozzy, Geezer, Bill and Tony were put on deserted islands at the time of their births and they learned to play and write music with NO outside influences at all. This is an essential album. Even the cover is dark and menacing, a concept metal bands would adopt just as much as Sabbath's sound.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|So many movies these days feel the same as Hollywood recycles ideas over and over again.  This movie had a unique plot which was certainly a plus.  The idea of a person growing young was an interesting idea to explore, the cinematography was visually pleasing and parts were rather amusing.  Other reviewers have complained about inaccuracies and things that could never happen.  These pieces of the story don't bother me,  though, because the whole premise of the movie is a totally fictional idea--a man is born old and grows young; that is something that has never happened and never will, so who's to say what would \\"really\\" happen?  I do have to admit, though, that when Benjamin grows chronologically old (physically young) he does seem to take on both infant AND aged characteristics at the same time which only puts him in a worse position and I found that a bit frustrating.  But, like I said, this is all fiction, so who's to say the way it would or wouldn't be?  Also, some reviews complain of a meandering story line that is hard to follow.  I disagree.  The story isn't told in a conventional way, and perhaps you have to think a little bit to follow it, but I thought the very slight variation in presentation was refreshing.    So why just 2 stars?  I don't like walking away from a movie feeling depressed which I certainly did on this one.  Just this aspect was enough to knock off a full 2 stars.  The movie is full of lost opportunities, both forced and voluntary separation from loved ones, and a lack of satisfaction.  There is a brief period in our main character's lives where they are together and both very happy, but it is such a short season in their lives.  Really, they could have been together and have been happy like that for much, much longer but through a combination of their circumstances and their own choices, they are not.  I found this especially depressing since I didn't agree with the characters' choices.  I also found it terribly sad in the end that Benjamin becomes senile and can't remember who Daisy (or anyone else) is nor can he remember anything about his life,  and yet he is a small child and Daisy still has to take care of him.  And although chronologically Benjamin is eighty-something when he passes away, he has the body of an infant and it is very sad to me to see an infant die (perhaps that's just because I'm a new father <wink>).    Another star was lost for all the sex.  I don't remember any explicit scenes, but boy does Benjamin have a lot of sex in this movie.  That got really old really fast.    To sum up, if I were to compare this to another movie or two, I'd say it was a mix between Cast Away (mood) and Forrest Gump (story style).  If you really liked both of those movies, you may like this one.  If you didn't, then I suggest you spend your time doing something more productive than watching this movie.
B0029Q8C62|4.0|ok, so this is released the same day as Relapse. So I didn't realize it until I had listened to Relapse all day. This is hot!! Meth takes it to another level when he gets with Red and they are still great together! don't sleep on this one!!
1401207138|5.0|If you enjoy Watchmen buy the absolute edition. First off the colors have been enhanced and they are truly breathtaking. The bonus features included in the absolute edition are great, they really dig deep into what it takes to make a comic mini series/graphic novel.    Bottom Line: If you enjoy Watchmen I definitely recommend this version It truly shows off every possible aspect of the story. 5/5
0385340567|4.0|Typically entertaining escapist fare from Child's Reacher series, which has become my written equivalent of the Man with No Name series. As usual, Child has a knack for creating interesting scenarios that intrigue the reader enough to let him slowly weave his plot around you. Nothing to Lose isn't Child's best work - not by a long shot - but it's still a lot of fun, and it all builds to a pretty fantastic finale. The plot's not as solid as his best work (for my money, Persuader would probably be the one to go for, if I remember correctly), and the main villain never feels as compelling as you'd like him to be, but Child's solid writing and the fascinating Reacher more than keep things moving along nicely. Praising it for being a great thriller seems to undersell it; it may not change your life, but Child knows his craft, and few writers do it as well as he does.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|This is one of the best Bond movies I've ever seen.  Maybe I just clicked with it or, perhaps, it is the cinematographic skill of the production team.  I usually don't care much for action scenes as they are terribly repetitive and boring, however this film put me on the edge of my seat - it was fun, unpredictable and sophisticated.  Daniel Craig did a fantastic job! Subtle humor and great visual effects made the watching experience that much more enjoyable. I can't wait to see the next installment.
B001FB4W16|5.0|I usually watch everything HBO, but I have fallen behind of late. I had customers asking about this since last year so I was interested in what Ball's latest foray was about. I had to spend a fair amount of money to risk having Blu depth on these TV on Blu sets - but this one did not disappoint me in any way. The story has been reviewed plenty here, so I dissected the features and quality.<br /><br />The picture looks very professional, and there was plenty to go wrong with the majority of it being filmed at night. The colors of the outdoors in each night landscape look vivid, and the special effects still appear adequate considering the difficulties of getting it right (darkly lit interiors). There is some sparse grain depending on the location, but it was a pleasure to see everything - plenty of flesh tones (yes there is lots of sex) that all look clear and porous.<br /><br />The sound is what sells this though. The DTS gets used extensively in each episode. Sookie's thought reading can be overwhelming at times, you almost want to isolate one of the channels and listen to that one thought as all five channels are sometimes filled with conflicting voices. Even the low-key scenes had some nice outer channel usage - loved every minute of it.<br /><br />The special features are catered to both the lay True Blood person like myself and the avid followers. Your player has to be enabled appropriately to handle all of the PIP and text boxes that appear in the enhanced viewing. The hints were somewhat corny at times, but I still learned some interesting things about the characters. The PIP is a solid 1080 and appears just little enough to not be that distracting on a first watch. The commentaries from Ball are the best, and provide some decent insight on his creative process while still getting a few slams in there on the critics and story changes.<br /><br />I think it is a great investment for the followers, and might be a worthy rental for those that are sitting on the fence about trying this. Odds are though, after watching everything there is to offer on just disc 1 - you will be buying it.are though, after watching everything there is to offer on just disc 1 - you will be buying it.
B00004T9VY|5.0|For myself, Cat Stevens is one of the worlds great artist. Tea for the Tillerman, is by far his greatest work as Cat Stevens. For anyone looking for the best of Cat Stevens, this is the must have CD.   It bothered me that we lost Cat Stevens as we knew him, but now we have Yusuf Islam. Set aside the religion and hate, and just listen to the music, I think you will find that Cat Stevens is still here. Try his CD: An Other Cup Yusuf.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|This movie had excellent acting but I missed so much of the dialogue because I just couldn't hear what was being said much of the time. At home with it on my vcr, I turned the sound up to highest and still couldn't make out the actors' words. Most frustrating. Also, if one is looking to see an \\"entertaining\\" movie, stay home. There is nothing positive or hopeful about this film.
B00008NRL8|5.0|This is a great CD- I highly recommend it... if you love Latin music and especially the tango, then this CD is a must have!

I was just going to take a quick look but I couldn't put it down!  I found myself laughing out loud.  He loves to read Wimpy Kid books and it helps him find humor in his every day life.  I would recommend this book to anyone!

B000O77SRC|5.0|Undoubtedly the best of the 4 Die Hards and possibly the best action film ever made!  It is definately my favorite action film.  John McClaine is visiting his estranged wife at her office, the new Nakatomi building in Los Angeles.  The office is celebrating both Christmas and the opening of the new building.  Suddenly the building is invaded by what appear to be some heavily armed and very high tech terrorists who seal off the building and take all the employees prisoner.  John, a New York cop realizes what is happening and hides out in the empty part of the new building until he can access the situation and forge a plan of action.<br /><br />Against impossible odds, McClaine must save the hostages and convince the unbelieving Los Angeles police department what is going on before the terrorists can complete their evil plot.  This is a movie that will have you cheering out loud and cringing at the dangerous situations that keep presenting themselves.  There are alot of excellent supporting characters, including Al the disgraced patrol car cop as well as probably one of the suavest villians ever.
0061139378|3.0|Not one of my favorite Gaiman outings.... started out feeling like I was reading one of those old \\"Dick and Jane\\" books... you know: Jane has brown hair. See Jane run. Jane likes toys.... it got better towards the end, but the writing felt very basic. I think my expectations might have been part of the problem though too - the local store I picked this up from had it in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy section; if it had been in the Young Adult (or even children's section) I think that I might have been expecting writing a little more simple.  But that's not what I expect from what I find in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy section.  I did find the story itself interesting though. I can see why they turned it into a movie. It took all of about 90 minutes to read, so it's quick and cute if you have 90 minutes to kill. But I would prefer to re-read Stardust if given the choice between the two.
B001NXBRJG|3.0|Obviously, this is a great movie for special effects. The biggest upset was seeing a noticeable difference between the basic DVD and the Blu-Ray version. Neither the sound or video made me go \\"Wow, what a difference\\". I would recommend this movie to any who don't already own a copy...it's a must own in that respect!
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I must admit that I was very skeptical about this album at first, based on the few songs I heard between The World Cafe and various television spots they'd done.  I decided to assume they were all flash and not delve deeper into their music.  That worked well at first, and the long, cold winter spent with more organic, folkier music allowed me to extend my ignorance.  When the weather again began to turn warmer, and I decided to embrace, rather than shun, the sun, my mind was easily changed by hearing \\"Oxford Comma.\\"  Later, when I put it in my car with all the windows down and the warm air streaming over me, I got hooked.  This rivals early Beach Boys as great music to do this to.  Very sunny instrumentation, and good use of violin throughout.  Makes me wish I would have worked harder and gotten into an Ivy League school.
1439138311|2.0|This was a pleasant enough story, the kind your immigrant mother or grandmother might tell in her waning years, with the caveat that all turned out well in the end. Only, like the stories Grandma tells, it lacked the depth and tension to hold my interest for the length of a novel.    Having not read any of Colm Toibin's other works, which appear to have been prize-worthy, I can't comment on whether the shortfall here had to do with attempting to write from a female POV. Certainly other writers have managed that quite well, but here Toibin seems only to skim the surface. Events happen, but feelings about them are not explored in depth. At times the novel is peopled with various characters, none of whom, besides main character Eilis, we ever get to know, and I didn't feel I even knew her character all that well.    To me this novel was filled with missed opportunities. For example, though touched on slightly, the author seemed to have no knowledge of the deep rivalry between Italian and Irish immigrants. That Tony's mother accepted Eilis so easily--or at least it seems that way for, again, this isn't covered in depth--seems unlikely. Also, did Tony or any of his brothers fight in WWII? Some of them must have, but that never comes up. Except for the last few pages, the novel totally lacks tension, and instead goes on, page after page, with nothing more than everyday things, like going to work, going to school, going home.     Certainly this was pleasant enough, and I can't say I disliked it, but I didn't really like it either, and I'd have difficulty recommending it.
0743298039|2.0|I found this book boring in the sense that their seemed to be to much of it.The premise is interesting-the twist*no spoilers*got me-but by the time we get to the end of the story I found myself asking do I really care?This book has been compared to Jane Eyre-Don\\"t believe it!Or the hype that this book has.I guess all in all this book left me a little empty and wishing I had the time back that it took me to read(listen) to it.
031606792X|4.0|I enjoyed Breaking Dawn.  In my opinion, it is the first bearable book since Twilight.  By the end of Eclipse, I had become thoroughly disgusted with Bella's selfishness and gracelessness.  I despised the way she tortured Jacob, unable to do what was best for him because it would cause too much pain to herself.  Her inability to accept care and affection from anybody (think of the many times Alice tries to be kind and is rebuffed) made me dislike her even more.  Edward wielded his \\"honor\\" as a weapon with which to hurt those he supposedly loved.  I can't think of two more stubborn and frustrating characters.  I even lost all respect for Jacob, for who would tolerate the treatment he received at Bella's hands?  I found myself wishing Victoria would win and do us all a favor.  In Breaking Dawn I saw explanations for a lot of this horrible behavior.  I still do not own a copy of New Moon or Eclipse.  One time through was more than enough for me.  However, I do have a copy of Breaking Dawn on my bookshelf, and I may even get around to rereading it this summer.  Do I think it should earn a Pulitzer?  Of course not!  Let's face it, people:  these are romance novels!  However, I think Breaking Dawn is a lot better than the professional reviewers say, and it's DEFINITELY better than the middle two books.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies of 2008.   I don't know HOW people are saying this was like Forest Gump. They're nothing alike, past both being great movies.   The tone of the movie is completely different. The language formation isnt anything like Forest Gump either. Clearly, the people who think so either saw something I missed, or (I think)just didn't get the movie.   Clearly, its a story about something that hasn't actually happened and more likely than not, never will. That aside, the characters are as believable as any other fiction of this sort if not more so.   I also didn't think this move was about his ineveitable death so much as what he did while he was alive. The ultimate 'you may never see tomorrow, so do what you can with today' movie. If you were depressed with the turns in this movie than you missed the whole point.   Everything about this movie was beautiful, endearing even. The score, the filming, the amazing fx, and brilliant actors made this movie the best I have seen in a VERY long time.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|This is a great performance.  It contains all of his standards and they are performed really well.  The sound mastering is great, one only knows it's a live performance for the audience noise.  Plus, the London crowd is awesome.  I highly recommend this album for any Leonard Cohen fan as well as this is a great album for a new listener.

1439138311|2.0|This is the simply written story of a young Irish woman named Eilis Lacey, who leaves Ireland for Brooklyn in the 1950s, for more economic opportunity.    An Irish priest in Brooklyn secures a saleslady position for her in a Downtown Brooklyn department store. He finds a room for her with an older Irish lady who takes in young lady borders. He enrolls her in  Brooklyn College night school so she can get a certificate in bookkeeping and eventually secure a higher paying position. She will meet and be courted by a young Italian man. When things seem to be falling into place for Eilis a tragedy recalls her to Ireland where a series of events occur forcing her to make an important decision.    The atmospherics here are handled well. I was born and raised in Brooklyn during the 50s and 60s, and the novel brought back memories despite some errors made in Brooklyn geography. It was this connection to my Brooklyn childhood that drew my attention to this novel in the first place. However, the simplicity of the telling of the story quickly became monotonous and then began grating on my nerves as did Eilis' curious impassivity which leads to her problems. She seems to be moved along in life by other people's decisions, not her own.    Despite the fact that the book jacket promised a surprising denouement, I found it a big disappointment. It is all much ado about nothing. It is difficult for me to believe that the same author who wrote the superb novel, 'The Master' penned this dreary book. What is even more surprising are the laudatory reviews here.
0756405890|1.0|I don't normally write reviews but I have to for this garbage. When I picked this up and brought it to the checkout, the clerk visibily winced when he saw what book I had selected but didn't say anything. He clearly wanted to say something and now that I've read this I wish he had. I've never ever returned a book in my life but I returned this about a week and a half after I bought it. The same dude returned it for me and the expression on his face was hysterical. It was like he was thinking \\"O God not another one of these coming back.\\" As I turned around to leave, there was a pile of this book in the remainder bin. If they'd been there before, it would have been a big clue that this book sucks even at the 70% off remainder price. Definitely not even worth checking out from the library.     The worst part of the book is the author's inability to write. I mean everything is so boring, so nondescript. The characters might as well be walking around midtown Manhattan most of the time. I'm not kidding. As a comparison it's as if the author only knew salt and pepper could be used as spices when cooking so he adds salt, then he adds pepper, then he adds salt... You get the idea. The end result is lifeless nothingness so boring you'll be wanting to scratch your own eyeballs out especially when Kvothe, the only noncartoon character in the book, goes off on yet another meaningless tangent in one of the most poorly constructed worlds ever written about in fantasy.     For world construction it's as if Rothfuss picked up bits and pieces from other author's books but knew better not to pick out anything people would realize was lifted. You have the perfect hero. The university where he studies magic. The borrowed magic system. The meaningless love interest with a girl who's been trained to worship our hero. No not kidding, that's really in the book. With stuff this it's so cringeworthy, why even bother?    On top of that what's with all the ludricrous praise? After reading thisdrivel all I can say is you've got to be kidding me. I suspect most of the lavishing praise for this book are the author's friends and family. As far as authors who have praised this? I read in another review that Library Journal wrote a story about how authors write comments for books they never even read. It's a tit for tat system where authors scratch each other's backs. That must be the case here. My other thought is that the editor told everyone reviewing it this was a young adult title, not an adult title. It would explain one of the seriously bad covers I saw and bait and switch tactics wouldn't surprise me. This entire book is bait and switch. Nothing ever happens, not even when the dragon shows up. The dragons a herbivore. How stupid.    This book is so bad I'll recommend instead anything by Dr. Suess. Seriously? Seriously, at least Suess is entertaining, at least there's a reason for Suess's limited vocabulary. There's no excuse for Rothfuss's. I wish there was a zero star option, this is a book that deserves zero stars.

B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Just about everybody knows the stories revolving around the U.S.S. Enterprise and it's crew lead by Captain James Tiberius Kirk. This reboot is an alternate reality to what happened in those familiar stories chronicling the early days of how the crew came together, went through the ranks of star fleet, and basically became the characters every Trekkie knows and loves today. The only issues this movie may have had was if it would appeal to people who weren't fans of the original Star Trek and if it would be enjoyable to those people. Considering it was the number one movie in the country in its opening weekend, brought in another $43 million its second weekend in theaters (bringing its grand total to over $147 million), and has glowing reviews on both IMDb (8.5/10, over 50,000 votes, #71 in the top 250 movies) and Rotten Tomatoes (95% fresh, 245 fresh reviews, rated 8.1/10), the answer seems obvious.<br /><br />Star Trek exceeded all of my expectations. I'm not a Trekkie, but this is the movie that should have kicked off the summer season. The film is somehow capable of keeping the same essence of the original series yet inject a breath of fresh air into the franchise with new faces representing familiar characters. The film really appears to a wide range of moviegoers since it has just about everything anyone is looking for when they go to the movies and affectively blends action, comedy, sci-fi, and romance into one sensational adventure. The cast is truly superb. Karl Urban practically channeled DeForest Kelley in his portrayal of Dr. Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy and Simon Pegg as Scotty stole every scene he was in. Zachary Quinto fit the young Spock character like a glove. I could go on and on. There really wasn't a poor performance from anyone.<br /><br />The only minor complaint I have about the film was the lens flare effect they seemed to use throughout the film. It was hardly noticeable at times, but I remember it being a bit irritating towards the last half of the film. Other than that, I'd like to see more of Scotty in the sequel. But that's more of a suggestion than anything.<br /><br />Star Trek is a fun and exciting film that's really for everyone. The film is a little over two hours long, but it feels much shorter. If you were waiting to see that one entertaining film that really starts the movie season off with a bang, then this is it. Go ahead and group this with Batman Begins as one of the successful reboots that's also incredibly enjoyable.han that, I'd like to see more of Scotty in the sequel.

B000089RV6|5.0|Back in Black was the first AC/DC album that I ever bought, and it instantly made me a fan of AC/DC for life. They are definately one of the greatest rock bands to ever grace the planet, and they're one of my favorite rock bands as well. I got this album about nine years back, and it's been one of my favorite albums since then, and I still listen to it to this day forward. I would also go on to collect all of AC/DC's albums since then including other classics such as Highway to Hell (1979), Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (1976), For Those About To Rock We Salute You (1981), and The Razor's Edge (1990), but Back in Black is without question AC/DC's best album ever, as well as one of the best selling albums of all time. Released on July 21, 1980 Back in Black is 10 tracks of pure loud, raunchy, high octane, balls-out, straight-up hard rock from beginning to end. This is also the first AC/DC album to feature singer Brian Johnson who replaces the band's original singer Bon Scott who died on February 19th of that same year from heavy drinking. Brian's raspy style vocals are just awesome and very effective throughout this whole album. Angus Young's guitar solos are just excellent on here, he's always been one of my favorite lead guitarists, and his brother Malcom is also an awesome rhythm guitarist as well. Cliff Williams's bass is pretty good and it keeps up with the guitars just fine, and Phil Rudd's drumming is simple, but it sure gets the job done. I really like the sound of his drums on here.<br /><br />Every song on Back in Black is just excellent, and it also features some of AC/DC's biggest hits as well, including the slow, brooding opener \\"Hells Bells\\" which begins with slow tolling bells and then the great intro riff kicks in, and then the drums also kick in seconds later. I like Angus's solo around the 3:35 mark of the song. \\"Shoot to Thrill\\" is another big hit, and a faster high energy rocker. The chorus is just great, I like the one line \\"Too many women with too many pills\\". The riffs are great too as well as Angus's soloing. Other favorites on the album include track three \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" and track five \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\". The title track \\"Back in Black\\" is another one of the band's best songs, and it's also a tribute to Bon Scott as well. The main guitar riff is just excellent, it's simply one of the most memorable riffs that I've heard on any song. Track seven \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" is another one of the band's big hit singles, and also one of the best hard rock songs ever. How could any hard rock fan not love a song like this? The main riff is just crunchy and addicting. Brian's vocals are great, especially in the chorus, and the solo by Angus is just awesome. This definately one of my favorite AC/DC songs ever, it just never gets old. Another one of my favorites \\"Have a Drink on Me\\" is an awesome, catchy blues rocker, and it's also a great song to listen to while rocking out or sipping on a cold beer (I prefer Coors Light). Track ten \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" is an excellent anthemic album closer with great lyrics and a solid, memorable sing-a-long chorus, and the guitarwork is great too. This is another one of my favorite songs on here, and an excellent way to end a classic rock masterpiece.<br /><br />Overall, Back in Black is an essential hard rock album that not only rocks hard, but it hits hard as well. No hard rock/metal cd collection should not be complete without a classic album like this. I highy recommend this album to any AC/DC fan young or old. If you're a newbie, hey this would definately be a great album to start with. Buy this album now, crank the volume up, and play it loud...ills\\". The riffs are great too as well as Angus's soloing.

I highy recommend this album to any AC/DC fan young or old. If you're a newbie, hey this would definately be a great album to start with. Buy this album now, crank the volume up, and play it loud...
0425200469|5.0|Death on the Nile is a great whodunit, that literally kept me guessing to the very last page. Being a huge Egypt buff, this book gave me a very nice sense of a boat ride down the magnificent Nile to see some of Egypt's spectacular sites. It's a fun read from a bygone era, with lively characters, an intricately presented plot, and the charming detective Hercule Poirot. It's an entertaining story, but it also is a very sharp commentary on people, their motivations, and social norms. Though the book is from an earlier era, so much of the human struggles, interactions, hopes, dreams, beliefs, misguided notions, and foibles ring true today. Agatha Christie takes her time in unveiling the truth of the crimes, leaving clues scattered about, and ensures that her full hand is not shown until the very end. A most worthwhile read!<br /><br />Rai Aren, co-author of Secret of the Sands

B00177Y9ZC|1.0|I'd give it 1/2 a star if I could. This movie was absolutely atrocious; the dialogue was abysmal and laughable, the 'heroine' stunk, there was absolutely no point in Diane Lane's character, no reason for a lot of it really. An annoying waste of time with no redeeming qualities except for some cool special effects, an idea that has potential but didn't see it realized here and, of course, the good-looking Hayden Christensen. Just stay away.

0679745203|5.0|This book is actually really interesting. The author does a good job with this book - the story is told in bits and pieces, jumping back and forth between time and between the perspectives of different characters. Ondaatje explores a variety of themes: boundaries, identity issues, love, war and war scars, nature, religion...The English Patient really transcends normal books in that respect. It covers a lot of different thought-provoking themes. I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it to others.

B001YB29HG|5.0|Joss Whedon fans, get ready to rock!  DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG is ROTFLMAO funny.  Campy, corny, and tongue-(firmly)-in-cheek, this ~45 minute web blog will delight Buffy/Angel fans, Firefly fans, super hero/super villain fans, sci-fi fans, musical fans, and pretty much anyone who just likes to have a good time.  DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG is completely unexpected and is Joss Whedon at his outlandish best.<br /><br />Joss Whedon apparently got bored during the 2008 writers strike and conceived this little gem as an \\"online mini-series event.\\"  Neil Patrick Harris is terrific as Dr. Horrible, an arch-villain wanna be who has a video blog about his life goals:  to join the Evil League of Evil and to win the heart of Penny, the girl of his dreams.  NPH is in fabulous voice.  I had the privilege of seeing him sing the lead in RENT a number of years ago; it always amazes me that little Doogie has such pipes!  Nathan Fillion steals the show as the comic superhero, Captain Hammer.  Vain and self-aggrandizing, Fillion plays this roll to a tee.  Felicia Day is sweet and sentimental as the love interest of both.<br /><br />The singing is outstanding, and the songs, written by Whedon and crew, are engaging, humorous, and toe-tapping.  Perhaps this should have been the all-sing, all-dancing blog...who knows.  The songs are all quite diverse, representing a variety of musical styles.  DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG is an off-beat, crazy, rollicking good time.  Log on to Dr. Horrible's Blog today (really, it is a real website!), and have a look for yourself.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|HBO has done it again with another awesome show. I have been hooked on Entourage since it came out and a friend of mine told me to check this show out. I just went and bought it today and i cant stop watching it. Im from the south, and this show hits the nail on the head about how the deep south is. The story is great and the characters are even better. This show puts that movie twilight to shame. The story is better and the acting is WAY better. I cant wait for the second season to start next month. I would recommend this show for anyone.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|Quantum of Silence is a good flick well suited for the new James bond. Lots of action right from the git-go but without the now familiar cliches. No Bond, James Bond introductions. This is a James Bond make over and I don't thnink it hurt the series one bit. It was, in fact, about time. The drink is still there, shaken but not stirred. It is just not as obvious. Treats the audience more like the grown-ups they have most likely become. Daniel Craig makes a great Bond. The women will still love him.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|I can't believe the negative reviews for this album!  I consider this my second favorite album of the decade after White Blood Cells (and at times, I've considered moving this one into the top spot).  When I first bought this, I listened to it incessantly for at least 6 months.  It still gets heavy play in my rotation.  Every single song is golden.  Yeah, they're derivative of 70's hard rock, but so what?  That's some of the best music in the history of rock.  Wolfmother captures that sound so perfectly and is able to bring it into the modern era.  I'm sure by now anyone reading these reviews has already heard them anyway, but if there is someone out there who still hasn't, do yourself a favor and get this cd!
0790744759|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time and I'm thrilled to have multiple copies to enjoy forever.  Great Judy Garland music and choreography.  Love the time period in the early 1900's and beautiful costumes.  Can't go wrong with this one.

B000MXPE74|4.0|I'm so glad I found this album.  I knew the first time I listened to it that it would become a regular in my cd player.  Nearly every song is so witty and so energetic, and there are so many catchy hooks.  You'll find yourself listening to this one over and over.  I deduct one stat only because there are some songs towards the end that do tend to drag on multiple listens, ones that you might call filler.  But, they don't detract too much from the first 8 or so songs which are all amazing!
B001VPJZJU|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES.

B001UE276A|5.0|A very mature version of DM that I have grown to love. 3 times and I was hooked. Dave, Martin and of course the fabulous Andy have done it again. Wisdom and knowledge are revered in the lyrics while Andy continues to \\"read\\" beyond the lyrics and create musical magic. It's still as dark as ever, but so romantically innovative. See you boys in Toronto as I am willing to travel from the rock and roll capital of Cleveland, Ohio. Wish you would have come here, but I know you will deliver....as always.  Thanks for all of the music. Don't know what I would have done without you.

B0010ZR160|3.0|A thoroughly interesting storyline, good screenplay, excellent depiction of the growing American underclass (this time in Boston) made for only a decent experience due entirely to the mistake of Ben bringing his little brother on as the main male character. His acting resembled a school play in a very small school on a bad day!<br /><br />Try to ignore it and the movie is actually good and worth another Star. It raises important ethical dilemmas in today's world.
B001EOOQEC|5.0|While I have owned the 1980 Heaven and Hell album for 5 or 6 years, I did not actually get Mob Rules and Dehumanizer until a few weeks ago.  Well, I'm glad I finally did. I like both albums very much. It seems that this album received more negative reviews than the earlier 2 Dio-lead Sabbath albums, but I don't understand why. Some of the negative reviews might be from fans who never heard the original Ozzy lineup and simply find this album too raw and nasty.  In fact, I think Dehumanizer might actually be better than the other 2 albums because it packs more power and emotion.  It's definitely the hardest of the 3 and is more like the original Ozzy incarnation of Black Sabbath.  It's definitely very underrated.<br /><br />I like all of the songs very much.  Dio does sound more angry and bitter than he generally does, but that's OK.  The rest of the band really rocks. Butler throws off some great bass lines and Iommi delivers great guitar solos. While the songs are all dark and intense, they have sufficient variety both within and between them to keep things interesting.  I think After All (The Dead) and Letters from Earth are the most interesting songs on the album.  Master of Insanity, Time Machine, I, and Buried Alive are all hard-driving rockers.  Another reviewer made the astute observation that Dio sounds like Ozzy on Sins of the Father. This hadn't occurred to me, but it's very true.<br /><br />So, if you love Black Sabbath and are not an Ozzy purist, then go get this album.  You might be pleasantly surprised by how good it is.
0307408833|2.0|I am an avid baker who has an allergy to flour. So I bake and bake and never get to taste my beloved sweet treats. Needless to say when I heard about the babycakes cookbook I couldn't wait to get it and get started GF baking.     Like many of the other reviewers I too was disappointed in the cost of ingredients and the lack of accessibility to them. I went to Whole Foods and spent $88.98 and still didn't have everything I needed. I made one batch of red velvet cupcakes and already used half my jar of $10.99 coconut oil and I haven't made the frosting yet because I can't find coconut flour or dry soy milk anywhere.     The good is its a beautiful book and will be a nice coffee table conversation piece.
0807126063|5.0|Like Walker Percy at first I wondered what on earth I was reading. This won the Pulitzer?!  Then, without warning it seemed, I was swept down the rabbit hole into a foreign land peopled with characters so quirky and at the same time believeable that I felt I knew them.  Most of the read I felt incredulous.  I had a hard time really laughing as the undertone of saddness and despair was always there for me.  I ached for Ignatious, his mother, Jones, and all of the other finely drawn characters.  The writing is superb.  New Orleans back streets and French Quarter, St. Charles Avenue.  I could see them all as they were vividly described.  I will read this book again and again - for the language and for the author's ability to take me with him inside his world.    Bettie Banks
B001TH16DI|5.0|The packaging, the transfers, the sound, and yes the video are all excellent on this Blu-ray set.

Just Beam these to your mailbox and enjoy!
0061854549|5.0|This book and Dan Ariely have recieved a lot of media attention, so I approached the book with some skepticism, thinking that it might be overhyped.  I'm pleased to report that my skepticism turned out to be unwarranted.<br /><br />The book has many strengths, the main one being that it convincingly presents many ways people are wired and/or conditioned to be irrational, usually without even being aware of it.  This eye-opening revelation can be a bit disheartening, but the good news is that we can fix at least some of this irrationality by being aware of how it can arise and then making a steady effort to override it or compensate for it.  That's not an easy task, but it can be done.  As a simple example, I've programmed a realistic exercise schedule into my PDA, and I've been very consistent with my exercise because of that.  The PDA imposes a discipline on me which I couldn't otherwise impose on myself (as I know from experience).<br /><br />The book is also well written, and I would even say enjoyable to read.  The many experiments described in the book are presented in a lively way which elicits interest, and Ariely goes into just the right amount of detail -- enough to convey the basic experimental designs, results, and plausible interpretations, without boring the reader by getting into esoteric points which are more appropriate for journal papers.<br /><br />The one criticism I have of the book, which applies to most of Western pscyhology, is that most of the described experiments used US college students as subjects.  That raises a serious question regarding the extent to which the results can be generalized to people of the same age who aren't college students, people of other ages, and people outside the US.  Study of cultural psychology reveals that differences due to these factors can be profound, and Ariely himself notes a Korean study where such differences were observed, but he doesn't really elaborate on the point.<br /><br />Despite this one criticism, I think this is an excellent and authoritative book, and among the better ones in the \\"why smart people do dumb things\\" genre, so I highly recommend it.  The insights revealed are both fascinating and practical, if you can muster the discipline to apply them.t and authoritative book, and among the better ones in the \\"why smart people do dumb things\\" genre, so I highly recommend it.

0143142356|5.0|After reading Pillars when it was first published I kept hoping that Ken Follet would write a sequel.  It waas well worth the wait and every bit as engrossing as the original.  I read the book, World Without End, then decided to share the audio book with my husband.  The narrator does a great job reading in the various accents of the different characters.  He brings the words to life so well that it's almost like watching a play.  Despite it's length, we would put aside a couple of hours each day to savor the story.  On a recent road trip it made the miles tick by so quickly as we were so engrossed in the story.  Follet created such full-bodied characters and a roller-coaster tale that contains love, life in the 1300's, politics, religion and war.  A masterpiece equal to his original work Pillars of the Earth.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Went seeing it expecting nothing...there certainly have a couple of big summer movies that completely have disappointed the fanbase by mishandling characters for movie adaptions (see X-MEN Origins Wolverine)  but I liked this new Star Trek movie. Granted there were a lot of Sci-Fi action cliches but what I was wondering to see here is how they would again these lovable characters from TV show for another movie. I don't think this was a huge risk like others have said because Star Trek has a loyal fanbase. Anyways.    Story (Spoilers)    Spock from the future tries to prevent a star from going supernova  because it will destroy the planet Romulus. He fails and so Nero holds him responsible and spends 25 years plotting his revenge along with fighting the federation.    J.J Abrams did a good job. The movie you can watch it as a stand alone sci-fi movie or watch it as part of the Star Trek universe. Opinions vary of course. I see people and some Trekkies who don't like it, but I don't care much about because in the end it's about whether I enjoyed the movie.    I watched all the TV shows from TOS to Voyager and Enterprise. Anyhow, for me I thought J.J. Abrams did more than a decent job here. The film is well polished and obviously had a huge budget so it would deliver on action and special effects. Of course all that doesn't matter if the actors do a good job or the characters don't remain true to themselves so...      Kirk-Chris Pine     As expected he stayed true to the Kirk character. Pretty much a rebel that would do what he wants when he wants to. He is also still a womanizer (I don't know how someone could say his character was completely revised. Anyhow) I loved the scenes with him and Uhura. However, there was also a side of him like in the TV show that obviously cared about his comrades and his duties to the ship.    Bones-Karl Urban. Again stay true to the character. Bones has always been a textbook play by the rules character but again like Kirk saw the needto bend the rules when it matters. I think Deforest Kelley would have liked Urban's portrayal of Bones.    Spock-Zachary Quinto-This is probably the most \\"human\\" characterization of Spock ever. He lets his emotions show and isn't afraid to let others know it. Quinto delivers Spock in a way that stays true to his Vulcan roots but presents the human persona that Leonard Nimoy did so well in the series.    Nero-Eric Bana. Pretty good for the villain although Nero's type has been done over and over and isn't anything new (another psycho villain who attempts to blame someone for something they didn't do)    Christopher Pike- Bruce Greenwood-Another excellent choice. Bruce is an actor that's been around almost forever. He's the one that invites Kirk to join the Academy and to remind Kirk of the heroic deeds that his father did in the hopes that Kirk will also be a great leader.    I could go on the list but everyone did a good job. Obviously having Leonard Nimoy play Spock was a big vote of confidence that he loved the movie and recommended it.     I enjoyed it.

B001G9F9IW|3.0|It's official: Javier Bardem ([[ASIN:B0011BE3K0 No Country for Old Men]]) is the luckiest man/actor on the planet! I mean, this guy gets to make out with three of the most gorgeous women acting today. Forget that one of them is his current girlfriend (Penelope Cruz). He also got down with hottie Rebecca Hall ([[ASIN:B000L212HC The Prestige]]) and ultimate hottie Scarlett Johansson ([[ASIN:B000EQHXNW Match Point]]). Regardless of how I felt about the rest of the film, there was plenty of eye-candy for guys. And those ladies who think Javier isn't too shabby himself, well, there's that, too.<br /><br />But let me explain why I'm talking about how good-looking these folks are on-screen and why I started my review in such an unabashed way. Director Woody Allen is well-known for his love of beautiful people. Everything from [[ASIN:0792846117 Sleeper]] to [[ASIN:B000EQHXNW Match Point]] has been sexually charged, to say the least. But his take on relationships is exceptionally skewed toward the hyper-sexual, and that's even more true here. Some might compare this to his private life, but I'll leave that alone ...for now.<br /><br />***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />This time we have two women, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) on vacation in Barcelona, Spain. The two are good friends and Vicky (Hall) is taking a break in preparation for marriage to Doug (Chris Messina), whom she leaves back in the States. Cristina isn't even close to being ready for marriage, and rips through relationships like a laundry woman through sheets. Then the two ladies meet Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) who approaches them with a unique proposal: fly away with him to his house in the north and have sex with him; both of them. At the same time, perhaps. This doesn't surprise Vicky, who immediately labels him a troll with artistic aspirations. But Cristina is intrigued by his forwardness, and the two ladies go with him to his beautiful Spanish home. But Cristina gets sick after eating some bad food, which leaves Vicky and Juan Antonio together, and opposite sparks fly. Then, after Cristina gets better, Juan Antonio takes her into his bed, too. But then a phone call in the middle of the night leads to Juan Antonio's ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), coming to stay with them after a suicide attempt. Cristina and Juan become closer. His ex-wife and Cristina become closer. Juan Antonio and his ex-wife reignite their passions ...with Cristina getting involved with both of them, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Vicky is struggling to deal with her feelings on the night when she weakened and had sex with Juan Antonio. She begins questioning whether she's ready for marriage. But then Dough, her fianc&eacute;, comes to Spain with the option to get married there before returning to the States and \\"doing it up right.\\"<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />There are quite a few twists and turns in the multiple relationships that wind and unwind themselves. And that is what made most of the story interesting (that and the beautiful people surrounded by the beauty of Barcelona). So you can see why I started my review the way I did. It's mainly about how sexually charged relationships can change (or maybe not change) who we are. Which brings me to my next point: Penelope Cruz's Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress. I'm not gonna take anything away from her. She did a fine job. But she wasn't on-screen very much. Personally, I think Rebecca Hall got gypped during the Oscar's. Her battles for her emotional stability were what kept me watching, not Penelope Cruz. Hall's character was so conflicted that I could empathize with her. While Cruz's character only made me laugh because she seemed almost like a caricature.<br /><br />Still, it's an interesting film to watch.

B001PPLIFU|3.0|Daniel Craig IS the new James Bond. He cemented that position with his opening volley in the 2006 release of [[ASIN:B001DSNF8C Casino Royale]]. A bit more hard edged. A bit more gloomy. But just as dangerous, Craig gives us a Bond we're probably going to enjoy for several years to come. We get the same tough guy here in QUANTUM OF SOLACE but with a story that has problems.<br /><br />The good is that it picks up right where we left off with Casino Royale. We learn that a secret organization threatens the very government that Bond works for. Even to the point of shots being fired at M (Judi Dench, [[ASIN:B001MYIQK4 Cranford]]) by one of her own double-00s.<br /><br />Bond, still pining and hating his old love Vesper, finds himself enjoying his work too much. Killing is becoming a habit ...and M and her superiors don't like it. But when Bond begins to dig up dirt on political higher ups, M pays quiet attention. It all starts in a third world country and Bond's fascination with a beautiful girl (no surprise there) named Camille (Olga Kurylenko). She's after the man who killed her family. Bond's after whoever it was who shot at M. Their two paths intersect in an unusual way: Bond feeling sympathy for her and wanting to help her get revenge. Her feeling a unique pull towards Bond's unflagging search for truth, regardless of the cost. All of this is taken up by an evil man named Mr. Greene (Mathieu Amalric, [[ASIN:B000F1IQN2 Munich]]) who's trying to control the world's most valuable resource (I won't give that away) while giving super-politicos whatever they want. But Bond is on to him, and with his help, Bond aids Camille in getting her revenge, while also getting Bond closer to Mr. Greene.<br /><br />The biggest issue with the film, however, is the multiple threads that intertwine with Bond's actions. They are confusing in the extreme, making the watcher wonder what, exactly, is going on at various times. For instance, during a scene when Bond has to kill a man who happens to work for the British government, we never learn why this man got involved in the first place nor even who he was working for (clandestinely speaking). There's also a hotel that runs on fuel cells that goes boom! yet we don't know why this hotel is out in the middle of nowhere nor what fuel cells have to do with the storyline (yes, I know that fuel cells run on hydrogen, which can be gotten from water, but it still doesn't explain why it was out in a desert and not, say, along a river valley or near the ocean). There are other threads that also lead nowhere, but I'll leave you to discover what they were should you choose to watch this.<br /><br />But make no mistake, it IS an action-packed, 007 flick in the vein of what we've come to expect from Bond films. But it's a bit overly complicated. Something to be aware of.British government, we never learn why this man got involved in the first place nor even who he was working for (clandestinely speaking).

B001PPLIFU|5.0|I really enjoyed this film a lot. To me, it kind of had a similar feel to that of The Living Daylights. A lot of people told me not to go see it, that it was not as good as Casino Royale. They told me not to waste my money on it, and just rent it. Now that I saw it, I have to beg to differ completely. I thought it was better than Royale. I almost now having seen it, I want to buy it! I like the action more, and the nuances are to the point and necessary. Its interesting how Daniel Craig plays a Bond who not just anihilates his enemies but punishes them according to the damage they inflict on others. For example, the oil can in the desert to Greene, flashes back to Fields on the bed covered in oil. You cannot go wrong with this movie; its an excellent boost to the franchise.
B001RIY4WE|3.0|OK, so the movie itself has been around so long that anyone who is considering buying the second Blu-Ray release already knows and loves the film. I held off getting the original Blu-Ray release because of less-than-stellar reviews of the image quality.  This one seems to have taken care of that problem.  I have watched \\"T2\\" many times on DVD (the \\"ultimate\\" edition), and the Blu-Ray transfer is definitely superior.  The audio seems about the same to me, but I only have a 5.1 receiver and it doesn't support HDMI, so I can't really take full advantage of the lossless audio.    However, I can state without reservation that this Blu-Ray disc has the slowest loading time *by far* of any that I own.  I'm not exaggerating when I say it takes at least a minute or two for the initial load, and then all you get (unless your Blu-Ray player is connected to the internet, which mine it not) is a message from \\"Skynet\\" that you're not connected to the internet.      You're then given the option to \\"retry\\" or \\"cancel\\", with no explanation of what to do if all you want is to watch the movie.  If you hit \\"cancel\\", you wait for a very long time (5 minutes at least) for \\"Skynet\\" to connect to its \\"mainframe\\".  I guess they're trying to be cute with all this Skynet stuff, but they fail miserably.      If you inadvertently hit \\"stop\\" on your remote while watching the movie, you get to go through the whole ordeal again.  It's worse than discs that come with multiple previews (*cough cough* Disney), because at least you can skip through those.  This one won't let you go to the top menu, or anything else, until it's ready.  You just sit and wait for it to finish loading.  Granted, I haven't recently upgraded the firmware on my 4-month-old Sony Blu-Ray player, but since the disc plays fine once it has loaded, I don't think this is the issue.    Once you get to the main menu, it's clunky, awkward, and slow to respond. You'll think you've made the selection you want, only to discover that thedisc can't quite keep up with you.  It's all very annoying and totally unnecessary.  I have many other discs that offer all sorts of enhancements for players that are connected to the internet, and none of them makes you go through all this endless waiting.  Some reviewers here on Amazon have reported that they've given up on the disc, assuming that it would never load, so all I can say is, be patient, it may take 5 or 10 minutes, but don't give up, it may surprise you (or maybe not).      So, my final rating is 3 stars for a favorite movie with what's probably the best video transfer we'll ever get, but with this absurdly slow load time and ridiculous menu, I cannot give it the full 5 stars I would have otherwise.

B0016MJ6T2|5.0|[[ASIN:B0016MJ6T2 Party Monster]]The most shocking part about \\"Party Monster\\" is that it is a true story. The story of murder and mayhem among the Club Kids of the late 1980's and early 1990's, in New York, starring Macaulay Culkin as Michael Alig and Seth Green as James St. James, was based on James St. James' book \\"Disco Bloodbath\\". The book was rereleased as \\"Party Monster\\", after the movie was released. The story tells of Michael Alig's rise to fame as a party promoter in New York night clubs, and other improvised locations, funded by club owner Peter Gatien. Alig and his Club Kids wore wild costumes and makeup, and generally caused mayhem wherever they appeared. St. James was a drug addict, and soon Alig got heavily involved in drugs. Alig had a magazine for his Club Kids, called \\"Project X\\", also funded by Gatien. They appeared on television shows, most notably on Geraldo Rivera, doing nothing but looking fabulous and shouting about sex and drugs. However, this is a murder story, which is revealed at the very beginning, so this is no spoiler. I will not reveal the details, but suffice to say that Michael Alig and his accomplice, a costume designer called 'Freez', are both in jail to this day. It is a chilling story of what can happen when the party life, drugs, and inhibition lead to the extreme in behavior. It is so extreme that it is almost unbelievable - if it were not all so very true.

0375826726|5.0|While I highly enjoyed Eragon and Eldest, Brisingr brings a whole new dimmention to the story! Eragon was action packed; Eldest was emotional; Brisingr was a little of both with it's own added magic. Literally! Brisingr involved works of magic unimagined in the previous books. I really don't want to give away any of the story but I will just say that Eragon becomes more elf like every time I read him...    Anyway, I will end by saying that I highly recommend this book (as indicated by the five stars) and series if you have not read the first two. It is one of my favorites and I have read more books than fit in a small library.
0575081244|4.0|which for those of you who know my work, an other one of my hilarious puns actually featuring altered carbon. Magic.     Anyway, it does exactly that, this is an ultra-violent future cop-noir type offering, well written and realised, and with a series of nice plot twists and set pieces. I can actually picture the characters in my head, sadly what ruins it for me is that I picture Kovacs (the \\"hero\\") as bloody Jason Statham which cannot be a good thing for anyone. Pound to a penny he get the role if they film this one! The plot rattles along at a pleasing pace and the body count is impressive. There is a pleasing amount of backstory and the Envoy Corps surely must be ripe for a spin-off franchise, although the idea is ripped off David Gerrold at least (and I'm sure off many others!). Still, this is an above average crime thriller with plenty to commend it!    Oh, and the guy is called Kovacs and he doesnt even have a lollipop, bloody let down that is!
1933771690|3.0|Readers of Owen Barfield's SAVING THE APPEARANCES will be reminded of its opening pages.  Barfield has much more to offer those who are interested in the correlative relationship between consciousness and nature.  Lanza argues that science shows there was never a time when an external, dumb, physical universe existed, or that life sprang from it at a later date; any universe that could have preceded consciousness only existed in a state of probability waves.  His arguments usefully challenge our habits of thought, but he's probably afflicted by what Barfield calls a residue of unresolved positivism (shown, e.g., in his use of \\"brain\\" and \\"mind\\" as interchangeables).  I think the best use of this book could be to prepare readers for the challenge of reading SAVING THE APPEARANCES.  There, Barfield deals with implications that Lanza doesn't seem to be aware of, e.g. with regard to the \\"prehistory\\" of the earth.  Barfield explores language as a way to search into the evolution of consciousness in this book and other writings.  Dale Nelson's essay \\"The Troubled Legacy of Owen Barfield,\\" published in TOUCHSTONE magazine, is an introduction to the late British thinker.  See Lanza's essay \\"Biocentrism\\" in Discover magazine May 2009, and Tim Folger's article about John Wheeler (anthropic principle) in Discover for June 2002, for introductions to ideas basic to the present book.
B00005NTJM|5.0|I had the privilege of seeing this group as it was here and then several times after Mick Abrahams was replaced by Martin Barre. They were always electrifying in their stage presence and playing. 'THIS WAS' is not your typical Tull album but more the roots from which the band grew. The 'Bluesiness' of such pieces as 'Someday The Sun Won't Shine For You', 'My Sunday Feeling', 'Begger's Farm' and the traditional 'Cat Squirrel' show their tight blues delivery equal to any band at that time. Mick goes off on a real tear during his soloing on Cat's Squirrel and makes the album worthwhile for that performance alone. They get into some hard rock on 'Dharma For One' ( Clive Bunker made a name for himself with this classic recording) and they competently show their jazz influences on 'Serenade For A Cuckoo' and 'Round'.  Great stuff!  This is for all purposes a recording to own if for no other reason to have one of the great baseline recordings that made rock what it is today. Personally, it is my second favorite Tull album while being quite different from what they soon grew into as a rock band.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This film is funny, clever and at times quite dramatic.<br />It's a major shift for Will's goofy on-screen image!<br />His true acting abilities shine through in this film and you can't help but to get entrapped in his character's story.<br />Most comedic actors eventually feel like taking on a more serious role.<br />Jim Carrey gave an amazing and unexpected performance in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.<br />Adam Sandler was outstanding in 'Punch Drunk Love'.<br />And now Will Ferrel can also be added to the list of actors who are capable of more than just making you laugh.
B001SF8G1Q|2.0|What has remastering come to? I know this album has had a well deserved bum rap for poor sound quality but this latest incarnation is not much better. The level of tape hiss on each track is annoying to say the least. It's not worth your money to upgrade to this questionable improvement in sound.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|As usual, ignore the critics if you like good sci-fi movies. This movie was awesome! The moorwen was cool, the acting was good, the effects better than any sci-fi original. An instant cult classic ala Pitch Black.    I really wish this had had better (or any) marketing and distribution during it's VERY limited theatrical run. I would have loved to have seen it on the big screen. Still, as the title states, if you like sci-fi movies, then go get this one on DVD. You won't be disappointed.
0316017922|4.0|Outliers, The Story of Success is the third massively best selling book by author Malcom Gladwell.  It is certainly the fastest and easiest read of his three books, which also include The Tipping Point (2000) and Blink (2005).      There are three general themes in Outliers; 1) To become an expert in your craft you need around 10,000 hours of   practice, 2)  Raw intelligence is not an accurate indicator of future success, and 3) The \\"luck\\" of privilege will help you achieve more than raw intelligence alone and will likely give you the advantage to get the 10,000 hours of practice.  The book is full of interesting anecdotes about the mysteries of success in all forms.      One of the takeaways is that constant, determined practice by a person of moderate skill or intelligence can raise one to the level of highly successful, which is a good thing for those of us who aren't born into wealth or score in the highest percentile of our intelligence tests.  Success can be anyone's, though Gladwell does point out that there are some odd reasons why success in some fields may come easier to certain groups. One of the examples are the young Canadian hockey players who  are oldest at a certain cut off age for entry into a youth league and how that translates into better coaching and more practice which can result in greater success.  A similar story is told of a Czech youth soccer league with similar results.     Some of his conclusions can seem a bit of a stretch, but overall the book does make some very interesting points about success that I've not seen made before.  Gladwell's final story veers into the realm of personal, where he alludes to the story of his own success through the tale of his mother and father's unlikely courtship and education.    At the very least Outliers will make you think about the things in your control that can help you toward a path to success as well as the things that may be out of your control and what impact they may have on your path to, butpossibly not your ultimate, success.  Here's to your success!!  by Belinda Ellsworth, Step into Success, Inc.; [...]
1416550542|5.0|Life has dealt me an unfortunate amount of pain of late.  More than vicodin, I needed a really great novel to take my mind off injuries.  Kate Morton's The Forgotten Garden was just what the doctor ordered!  It is a triumph of non-linear storytelling, and the epic tale being told carried me away.<br /><br />The catalyst driving the story is Nell Andrews.  Nell grew up loved and happy in a house full of sisters in Australia.  All that changed on the night of her 21st birthday.  That was the night that her father confessed the secret that upended Nell's life--he had found her abandoned at the age of four.  She'd been left dockside of a ship that had just come from England.  She didn't know, or wouldn't divulge, her name and no one came for her.  He took her home that night, and he and Nell's mother had raised her as their own.<br /><br />That revelation changed the course of Nell's life, but she never had the opportunity to seriously investigate the mystery of her origins until after her father's death, when she was in her mid-sixties.  She made significant progress, but never fully unraveled the truth.  As the novel opens, we first meet four-year-old Nell, then 21-year-old Nell, and then the dying 95-year-old Nell.  She's being attended by her devoted granddaughter Cassandra.  Cassandra was largely raised by Nell and was closer to her than anyone, but knew nothing of Nell's secret until after her death.  Cassandra's even more surprised to learn that she's been left a cottage in Cornwall, England that Nell had secretly owned for years.  So begins Cassandra's quest to finish unraveling the mystery of Nell's life.<br /><br />The story jumps back and forth in time, not just between Nell's and Cassandra's investigations, but between the actual events that took place between 1900 and 1913 when Nell was abandoned.  There is a rich cast of characters from the gothic past, and the story that gradually unfolds is complex, compelling, and utterly gripping.  There's even a cameo by Mrs. Hodgson Burnett herself!  I plowed through the nearly 600 pages in record time, and only wish it had lasted longer.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed Morton's debut, The House at Riverton.  This sophomore effort seals the deal; I've become a devoted fan.  The Forgotten Garden is one of those books that I just feel so good about recommending to almost everyone.  It's a contemporary mystery, a Victorian drama, a novel of tragedy and triumph, and more than anything else a spellbinding story from start to finish.tt herself!

B00006FDCD|4.0|The second King t.v. mini series, but the first one to try and stay as truthful to the source novel as possible.  While I appreciated Tobe Hooper's rendition of Salem's Lot, I still felt the acting, production value, and alterations to the story were all too typical of television movies, plus it looked like it was filmed through a dirty cloth.  Stephen King's It was a big deal when it came out back in 1990, and though it was a lot scarier the first time I saw it when I was 9, I still feel it's an effective horror film in its own right.<br /><br />The first half of the story, the first night of two, is based on the main chracters' childhoods and their first and supposed final confrontations with the creature simply known as It.  It gets its name from the fact that it is an unknown supernatural being that can manifest or take the form of young kids' fears and nightmares.  One standout scene that is quite effective is the one involving a scared young girl desperately trying to clean blood from her bathroom sink but getting nowhere.  The preteens all play their roles quite well, especially Emily Perkings(Ginger Snaps 1-3) and Jonathan Brandis(Lady Bugs, Sea Quest).  The first half is set in the 50's and has that sweet and overly nostalgic feel with classic rock tunes and production design.  It sets things up for a surrene and nice setting and then we meet Pennywise, played brilliantly as funny and scary, by Tim Curry.  Pennywise takes the shape of the creepiest circus clowns you've ever seen.  King was smart for this one.  I mean, really, who the hell actually likes clowns?  The transitions from typical nostalgic fueled 50's to out-and-out terror and horror film conventions is very effective in this movie.<br /><br />The second half is littered with t.v. pedigree'd actors of the likes of John Ritter, Harry Anderson, Annette O'tool and Richard Thomas.  The second half of the tale, involving the older versions of the first half's characters, takes place 30 years after the end of the first night and unfortunately is less effective.  There are many reasons for this.  One of them being that we get very attached to the young performers in the first half, even though the first night lets us glimpse the older ones, that it's hard to lose them and their performances.  Not to slight the older performances at all.  John Ritter is a real stand out in this, though they all hit it out of the park in general.<br /><br />Other problems with the second half come in the form of the ending.  Though, we can't completely fault the filmmakers for this.  King wrote the ending that the film stays true to, but on the page a giant spider-like monster is a lot scarier in the imagination of the reader then it is on film visualised by special effects and one group of filmmakers'imaginations.  The special effects in this movie are really good though, especially when you take into consideration that it was made on a television budget and time schedule and in the early 90's!  That's one thing that horror fiction prose will always have over movies, the monster on the brain will always be scarier then the one on screen, no matter how well the speical effects are executed, CGI or other.<br /><br />Anyone who has read the novle know how very long it was and how long the epilogue runs on after the main climax has occurred.  The film, even at three hours, it's truncated for pace, time and content, content too violent or racy for t.v. viewrs in the 90's, especially on the family friendly ABC network.  Though, today I feel this is all kids stuff when compared to what's allowed to air on comercial t.v.  I really do miss the ritualistic thing the kids do before they fight the monster the first time in the book, though.  The film was co-written and directed by Tommy Lee Wallace(Halloween III, Fright Night part II), and co-written by Lawrence D. Cohen(De Palma version of Carrie).  Wallace came up in the film business working with horror royalty John Carpenter and he does areally good job on what must've been a monster undertaking with this film.  The tone is right and this is a straight horror film, no winking.  It moves fast, despite it's running time and it looks good.<br /><br />The DVD is a very good transfer and it's in Widescreen.  YAY and HOORAY!  I didn't even know this thing was filmed in widescreen, but I'm happy to have been able to see it that way, it's more filmic and less t.v.  Besides the great new widescreen transfer the only other special feature we get is an awesome commentary track by director Wallace and cast members John Ritter, Richard Thomas, Dennis Christopher and Tim Reid.  It's a lively and super informative commentary that goes everywhere from the history of the project, the casting process, the fights with standards and pracctices, the deviations from the novel, the things the actors didn't like aobut the film and the things that they did, and much much more.  I've listened to it twice since I've owneed this disc, it's really fun and worth checking out if you have this disc.<br /><br />This is a landmark t.v. mini-series for the medium and for Stephen King translations and adaptions, even though Salem's Lot came first. This film did it right and better first.  The only downfall about this DVD is the fact that it's a flipper.  One half of the series on each side.  Also, don't be fooled by the comedic line up of t.v. actors posted on the cover artwork.  They are all very good and appropriate in their respective roles.  Kudos to director Tommy Lee Wallace for having the foresight to know that all good comedy performers have a lot of darkness somewhere in their hearts.  About the cover artwork, I really wish that the orignal poster was used, the same one used for the hard cover novel, but we do get to glimpse it on the DVD menu.<br /><br />So, make some time and check it out, even if you have seen it already.ve been a monster undertaking with this film.

B000FS9MV0|5.0|If you love this genre of music (i.e, the presentation of the all-time standards for the best-written songs and lyrics in the history of American music, with creative and effective individual interpretations of those songs, along with a reasonable effort to generate something new of substantive value in this area) ...    ... then Renee Olstead, imo, is the best hope for this generation we currently have of continuing to enjoy, in this genre, the highest level of truly rewarding musical performance.    What sets Renee apart is more than just her remarkable talent (combined with the outstanding supporting work of David Foster).  What is dazzling is her intangible ability -- that Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald also possessed with their unique singing styles in the same genre -- to communicate the words and melody of the song to the listener in a personal way that not only paints the picture ideally, but also leaves the listener believing that the artist (in this case, Renee) actually enjoys the music herself, is willing to risk demonstrating her feelings for the music by giving an honest, open and bold performance of each song, and then, happily, is willing to share the finished product (subject to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in the marketplace) with the public at large.    Renee Olstead's musical talent appears to be one of a kind, so far, in this generation ... and, for all we know, she may be the last to communicate this effectively, in this genre, with her wonderful singing.    So, let's hope she can stay the course, because her albums, so far, are at the very top of the play-list (staying there far longer than any others) for many of us who have waited for years for this worthy sequel to her delightful \\"summertime\\" debut.    Thanks, Renee -- appreciate what we already are enjoying with your CDs, even if we have to wait another four years for the next album.  Your first CD still is in the car, now joined by \\"Skylark\\", and there is room for four more with this particular car's stereo system.    If necessary -- due to an expedited production schedule on your part -- we'll happily buy a new car with a more sophisticated stereo system.

B001GCUO1G|5.0|I am a total superhero nut.  It began with Christopher Reeves as Superman (yes my age is showing) and I've been hooked ever since.<br /><br />I loved every X-men movie; special effects & great actors they were awesome.  A little light on the plot and romance, but hey, they are based on comic books and cartoons, what do you expect?<br /><br />X-men Origins gave me what I was longing for: the explanation of Wolverine and Sabretooth's relationship.  More importantly it gelled perfectly with the other X-men movies and you get a glimpse of some of the other X-men as youths.<br /><br />I have to say this was one of Jackman's finest performances.  His ability to take his character through the stages necessary to convey Wolverines personality was masterful. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool (the guy with the swords) was surprisingly excellent (and here I thought he was just a comedy guy).<br /><br />Yes, Stryker - the bad guy - gets caught monologueing, but it was based on a comic book; you have to expect a couple of cliques.<br /><br />All in all this is a movie I'm glad I saw on the big screen and one I'd watch over and over.  (and not just for Jackman's nude shot.)

When they make the movie I really hope a good screenwriter can help...somehow. I have never felt so let down by a book.   I only wish somehow Stephanie would write the real version and throw this one out as someones nightmare.
B000VWE5OY|2.0|I loved \\"Who\\" and have watched both spin-offs; this and Sarah Jane Adventures.<br /><br />At first Torchwood was original, intriguing with a good group of actors.  That would be this Season.  But don't let yourself get hooked!  Season two takes a horrible turn for the worse.<br /><br />In season 2 it seams the writers are trying to make sure every character \\"bats for both teams\\" and everyone sleeps with just about everyone.<br /><br />I'm not a homo-phobe: there are questions about my dad who still rooms with the same guy he left my mom for.  My husband has a cousin everyone wishes would come out.  It is part of our world today.<br /><br />But this show makes it seem like it is natural for everyone to change their minds.  Take the butler like guy.  In the first season he is pining over his girlfriend that he's hidden int he basement. She's half robot.<br /><br />Season II:<br /><br />He and the Captain become lovers.<br /><br />It was my understanding that either you are or you aren't.  You don't just wake up one day and decide to swap teams.<br /><br />Add to this that the main character, the girl - I'm really bad with names - who is shacking up with her boyfriend.  She decides to have a romance with one of the guys in Torchwood.  It seems every other episode is about who's doing who.<br /><br />If that is what I wanted to see I'd watch Soaps.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I've watched nearly every Star Trek episode out there, starting with Kirk and even catching the spin off Deep Space Nine.  The only Treks I missed were the \\"Enterprise\\" series.  I irritated me to no end that Vulcans had emotions and I was convinced that without Gene Roddenberry one of my favorite SF stories was doomed.<br /><br />I was torn when I saw the previews for the new Trek.  I was excited to continue the journey, but didn't want to be disappointed.  I almost didn't go to see this opening weekend.... boy am I glad I took the chance.<br /><br />Not only did this movie manage to work within the set parameters of the Star Trek Universe, it gave us a glimpse of the characters we love in a brand new light.  I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say we know that the time-line can be messed with, right?<br /><br />Spock (Zachary Quinto) will not have to take a backseat to Kirk (Chris Pine) on this Trek.  Spock shares fully with Kirk in every way - even Captaincy.  Zachary's portrayal of the Vulcan was spot-on. (With his eyebrows tweezed you didn't even think Sylar!)<br /><br />Chris Pine, while still giving a good rendition of Kirk's womanizing side, does and excellent job hammering home that Kirk is a total bad boy, pushing the envelope, risk taking and loving every wild minute of it.<br /><br />Bones (Karl Urban) was irreplaceable. Not only did he physically remind us of Bones, he delivered his lines every bit a uniquely sardonic as Deforest Kelly.  He pulled off the \\"you green-blooded hobgoblin\\" flawlessly.  The interaction between Kirk, Spock and Bones lost nothing, in fact I think it gained in depth.<br /><br />Scotty (Simon Pegg) was a pleasant surprise.  Making his debut near the end of the show, he brought a fresh splash of humor.  With any luck they will broaden his roll in the future beyond \\"I'm given' her all she's got.\\"  Simon's proved he can handle it with the little they gave him in my book.<br /><br />Chekov, Uhura, and Sulu - small parts but not small actors.  It takes a team to make an excellent movie and though they may be in the outfield, their supporting rolls were not in any way overlooked.  You get a better feel for them in the short time they appear.<br /><br />Complaints:<br /><br />Only one - and it's very minor.  Spock is supposed to be around 100 to Kirk's 30 something in the original.  That should have remained the same.  But the way the intro is set up, you don't really get that with this movie; you could really think they were born around the same time.<br /><br />All things considered, this is a small and easily overlooked flaw.  Any SF fan will love this movie and if you Trekkies don't, well, what more can you expect.  This movie really had it all.  Great cast, solid plot, awesome special effects and even a dash of romance.

That should have remained the same.  But the way the intro is set up, you don't really get that with this movie; you could really think they were born around the same time.      All things considered, this is a small and easily overlooked flaw.  Any SF fan will love this movie and if you Trekkies don't, well, what more can you expect.  This movie really had it all.  Great cast, solid plot, awesome special effects and even a dash of romance.  It is my favorite movie in many years (and I see most of the new releases.)

0684824906|5.0|Before I start this review, I will first state that i'm only a part way through this wonderious piece of historical work.  From what I have read, I will rate it 5 states based on how indepth it goes into President Lincoln and his cabinet.    This historical work starts from the begining on how Lincoln and his cabinet of former rivals got into politics.  It describes their family life, their political views, and how they each came up through the ranks to become governors, senators, and eventually presidental candidates.      The auther describes how each member came into knowing each other and how they viewed each other before the 1860 presidental primary, during it, and after it when President Lincoln is elected.   The auther describes their personal feelings and battles, and makes it like a narrative.  Goodwin takes each chapter in chunks, going into detail on one character and then the next in order, describing how the atmosphere of politics eventually brings them all together.    My opinion from the bit I have read, this is an excellent work to read if you are interested in knowing the inner workings of the American government during the turbulent 40's 50's and eventually the Civil war.

0156030209|4.0|A very unique story that made for fun reading.    For the most part, I really enjoyed the story, but had trouble myself believing some of it, even knowing it was fiction!  Then there were the times it didn't quite match up.  I don't know how many times he said the blankets had diminished away, but then he still had a piece left, then he had a whole blanket, then no blanket, then multiple blankets.    The first 93 pages are all background and most of it completely useless information that bored me and was difficult to get through.  I did enjoy his bouts with three different religions, but for the most part thought most of this information could have been cut out.    The ending too was a disappointment as it made me question which story was real and which we were supposed to believe.  I found truth in both stories and really think the second story only made the first one seem even more made up.  It even has me questioning whether the point was for us to question the entire story we just got done reading.  The ending really could have been better.    I also could have done without all the \\"God is great; God is this; God is that\\" stuff.  It was too pushy for me.    And being a vegetarian myself and a huge animal lover, it was sometimes very hard for me to even read about the animals that didn't make it - even knowing it wasn't true.  Too real for me.    Still in the end, the story of Pi and Richard Parker was a great one and very unique.  There were so many times I only wished I had the time to read because I wanted to see what would happen next!
0765350386|4.0|I really enjoyed Elantris by Sanderson so I had to read some of his other books. The Final Empire was an excellent book I'm glad that I looked into Sanderson's other books.<br /><br />The Final Empire is set in a mist-haunted and ash-ridden world. Kelsier, \\"the Survivor of Hathsin,\\" pits himself against the immortal Lord Ruler's and his 1,000-year domination of both the Great Houses and their serflike \\"skaa.\\" Through alomancy that Kelsier acquired in the Ruler's most hellish prison called Hathsin Kelsier can now \\"burn\\" 10 metals. The metals fuel his superhuman powers he uses to assemble rebels in a loose plan to destroy the nobility and the empire and the Lord Ruler. Kelsier uses Vin, a street urchin with the same Mistborn powers Kelsier possesses, to infiltrate the Great Houses', where she falls for prince Elend Venture.<br /><br />At first the book seemed a little cheesy with the metal burning but as the story progressed the characters grew on me. I really enjoyed The Final Empire. I look forward to the other books in the series.
0756405890|5.0|It took me a few chapters to fully understand where and what the story was doing.  I stuck with it and was rewarded with a long and graceful story that had the power to move me both mentally and emotionally. This is not a typical fantasy novel.  It has a subtle satire, in fact, of tired fantasy traditions. Very fresh.
0316010669|4.0|It is somewhat less technical than [[ASIN:0618620117 How We Decide]] but gives different examples of the conscious decision making process vs. the unconscious process. Allows the reader to gain an understanding that while you are heavily influenced by environmental stimuli and data we are consciously unaware of, we can train our conscious mind to identify those influences and adapt/compensate for them. There is a part that even goes into mind reading (no joke). This is a must read for humans.
B001TW68P4|5.0|I got the new \\"Save the Turtles\\" collection last weekend. I thought the remastering sounded great! It's hard to believe that all those songs are roughly forty years old! With the remastering they sound like they were just recorded.    I remember a Captain Beefheart interview i once read where Beefheart talks about the first time he actually saw a Van Gogh painting up close in an art museum. He told the interviewer that the colors were so vibrant and the paintstrokes so vivid, it looked like Van Gogh had just painted it, went down the hall to go to the bathroom, and then came back to take another look at it. I had the same feeling listening to your songs on \\"Save the Turtles.\\" It sounded like you'd just recorded them, went down the hall to go to the bathroom, and then came back to have another listen.
B001V7YWTQ|1.0|I felt shorted.  After all these years two rock legends reunite I expected more. They could have put effort in the liner notes (more information and photos interviews with the band ect.) They never introduced the members of the band during the concert or for that mater talked to the crowd between songs at all. No special quests.  when I heard Eric Clapton and Steve winwood were going to do a live show together at Madison Square Garden after 40 years I thought it would be the cd release of the year. Boy was I wrong.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This movie is definately the most intensense movie I ever saw.  It makes the Exorcist look like a bedtime story.  But the fact is, it is a true and by far the best horror movie ever.  It has a great story line and it starts with action and only progresses more intentensly as the movie moves forward.  It also has the whole emotional side of it that allot of horrors dont have and on a very intense level.  This isnt a movie for the faint of heart but for a true horror fan with a strong stomach, definately...enjoy!!!
B00005JLIU|5.0|I was pleased to receive my DVD in a matter of days, way less time than the estimated delivery date.  It was in brand new condition, still sealed and wrapped in plastic.  A very funny, light-hearted movie!  Excellent entertainment.  All-in-all a most satisfying experience.

1439138311|3.0|For the record, I thought Toibin's 'The Master' one of the great novels of the last few years.  It was my first Toibin experience, and afterwards I went back to his earlier work, but none could compare.  Now comes 'Brooklyn,' and I'm sorry to say, it seems not particularly worthy of the author.  The characters are vivid, yes, but a few days after I closed the book they were easily forgotten.  This is a slice of life story (and I use the word 'story' loosely.  There's not much story here), the experience of a young woman, first in Ireland, then in Brooklyn, then back in Ireland, and whether or not she'll return to her new life in Brooklyn.  Toibin handles his characters with delicate care, but this seemed to me to be a narrative not terribly deeply considered.  I could not envision Brooklyn at all, oddly, though he has clearly done research.  A bio in the New York Times a few weeks back revealed that Toibin writes longhand (with a photo, reminding me of something by Charlotte Bronte).  That's exactly what this made me think of: a book written without much need of editing.  Since 'The Master' I expect more from Toibin.  I'm now reading Sebastian Barry's new novel 'The Secret Scripture' and there is simply no comparison.  I highly recommend that novel, but, very sad to say, not this.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|\\"Wall-E\\" is the story of a small robot with a big heart. The last of the \\"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\\" robots, Wall-E's job is to compact the garbage that's taken over Earth and caused humans to abandon the planet some 700 years ago. Wall-E dutifully goes about his job, but demonstrates many human characteristics, including a desire to love. When an EVE probe is sent to Earth, Wall-E falls hard for her and follows her back to the Axiom, a luxury spaceships where what remains of the human race has been loafing around for the past several centuries. The captain of the ship ultimately joins forces with Wall-E and EVE in an effort to return to Earth, but they must overcome powerful technology that's been in place for a very long time.<br /><br />I appreciated this movie's charm and innovation, but didn't like it quite as much as I thought I would. I appreciate the eco-friendly messages \\"Wall-E\\" is trying to send, but the ending of the film bothered me because it seemed too easy. What happened to all of the waste that had been polluting the Earth for many hundreds of years? Did it just disappear? I think it sends the wrong message that pollution can always be overcome, even if it takes hundreds of years, but the reality is that if we destroy Earth, it may never be habitable again. I would have preferred to see the humans in the film colonize a new planet and take better care of it instead of have Earth magically restored to its past splendor.<br /><br />Enough of my soapbox, however. \\"Wall-E\\" is still a very cute movie. Also, Fred Willard is in it, and he's absolutely hilarious. What more could you want?
B001UE276A|5.0|I wish they had box sets like this when I was a kid!  Very well put together.  The surround mix is great, the bonus tracks are great (and I don't have to buy the singles, I hope!).  The remixes are a little lack-luster and uninspired.  The demos are all stripped down, but not as different as I was hoping... I guess I was hoping for them to sound quite different, and maybe even a couple with Martin on his acoustic guitar or something.  They're still kind of cool because you get to hear Martin sing songs you haven't heard him sing before.  The books are good quality, but I wish there was more content... like actual written content.  The pictures are great though.  Overall it's a great box set and worth the price (I got it at Amazon's sale price).  This is NOT for a casual or sometimes fan.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this BBC mini-series.  The characters were so well developed, the story lines were great, and the acting was first rate. (Judi Dench is wonderful).  It's considered a period drama but there is a healthy dose of lighthearted humor mixed in, which in places had me laughing aloud.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves period pieces.

B00005Q66T|4.0|Not an avid Madonna fan, but do enjoy some of her songs. And the ones I like are here.
B000002NG7|3.0|The album is fine. Thera are some nice, energetic songs, but it also has many fillers. The production sucks; apparently King For a Day... is their highest point in terms of sound. But if you like Faith No More and appreciate their work, you'll dig it.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|One of my favorite Clapton albums.  Couldn't stand to hear \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" one more time but love the way he plays the blues.  While purist Robert Johnson fans may object to anyone, anywhere reinterpreting the master, Clapton knows what he is doing.  He just does it his way.  Can't blame an artist for that and fortunately for us fans, we love him for it.  This album is a different, more polished version than the DVD.  I like them both for what they are.  I try to listen to every version recorded of \\"C'mon in My Kitchen\\" and this album contains my second favorite version. Unfortunately Bonnie Raitt has never recorded her version.  My only wish is that Clapton would record more albums like this one.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|There are no words for this film. If there's something to learn from it, i don't see how consuming feces and just ridiculous behavior teaches anything in the first place. It shows the sick mentality of some people in this world. Well that's what i get for being curious ... i mean don't get me wrong i enjoy watching some pretty off the wall movies from time to time like Hostel for instance, but this one Salo did cross the line. I didn't get the plot if there was one, and i don't get the stupidity either, sorry. I guess you must be some type of philosophy genius  or something to get it, like those significant amount of 5 star reviewers out there. To each it's own i guess ...
B0008ENICU|5.0|First, ignore any of the reviews with a 1, 2,or 3 star (and Jeff'sdate needs to get an identity check-up).  This movie is one of the best about women there is and the updated one that just came out doesn't hold a candle to it.   It is NOT against women in anyway. In fact, it celebrates women and how varied we are as a group--and the dumb things WE do for/about/to get a man. Other things about this film--everything, including the animals are female. Take a close look at the art in the film, it is female. There is over $5 million in jewels (by today's prices) in the film.  And if any of you open up to say that you don't talk about other women-even your friends in this manner--you are so not telling the truth. Even my boyfriend, who loves this movie, has brought it to my attention that several of the characters remind him of some of my friends.  So I had my friends over for an evening picnic and movie and this was the movie I showed. They all have copies of it now. Just because it was produced in the 1930's doesn't mean women have changed ALL that much when it comes to fashion, jewels, and men!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|I LOVE Westerns, and this is by far my all-time favorite. Here is America's greatest movie genre, the Western, writ large, with three (count 'em) three gunslingers who rise to mythic proportions: William Monie (Eastwood), Little Bill (Gene Hackman), and English Bob (Richard Harris). It's got it all: sex, violence, some tenderness and even plenty of humor. Great lines, and the best shoot-out at the end I've ever seen. I have to grab a bowl of popcorn and turn off all the lights for the last 15 minutes even though I've seen it dozens of times.
B000002JEV|4.0|This album was ordered for a friend, but he couldn't use it. I listened to it, and was immediately reminded of the heady days back in the late 60's and early 70's when I \\"rocked\\" to these tunes. Unfortunately, most of them have aged worse than I believe I have.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|I won't recount the plot here as many have already done so. This movie has its uneven points that I'll get to in a bit, but in general, I found it to be a little different than usual and somewhat thought provoking. Imagining a person aging backwards makes one think about issues of life and death as well as what it takes to enjoy life at any particular time. In that sense this is an interesting movie to watch. Now for the bad. First of all, I found the dialog in this movie difficult to hear for some reason. I don't know if it's the accents or background sound in the movie or what. While a lot is made of the portrayal of the aging, I found it to be a bit uneven. At times it seems like the Benjamin charater de-ages at the wrong pace. He seems to get young too fast in some cases. There were a few things in the movie that were interesting but seemed a bit out of synch with the movie like the Hurricane Katrina setting for the present-day storyline, the clock that goes backwards made by someone who doesn't appear to have a lot to do with the outcome or the string of fate sequence leading to an accident for one of the characters. Finally, one of the big disappointments for me was the fact that it seemed like long streches of the movie were somber sequences that left out many interesting possibilities. In spite of the insinuation that this character did a lot in his life, he actually does surprisingly little in the movie, and the age peculiarity actually is developed surprisingly less than it could have been. I also didn't find the love story to be terribly believable or the two characters to have a lot of chemistry, but somehow it sort of works in the end for what the movie is trying to achieve I think. This certainly isn't one of the best movies ever and I find it hard to see myself watching it a second time, but it was definitely worth seeing.

0307388921|5.0|\\"You gain power by pretending to be weak. By contrast, you make people feel so strong. You save people by letting them save you.\\"          Choke is an excellent book, if a mildly confusing read. Palahniuk is not dependant on chronological order when he writes, instead shifting between different periods in the life of his anti-hero, Victor Mancini. From being continually kidnapped by his crazy mother as a small boy, to living for the moment, to finding a direction for his life, Victor grows dramatically during the story, even if it does not always seem that way.          Victor is a sex-addict, who goes to sexual addiction recovery classes to get action with the other students. He is a worker at a colonial theme park, who has no respect for the history his portrays. But most of all, Victor Mancini is a savior to the downtrodden (and the chronically confused). He chokes on food at restaurants so that people will save him, and then feel obligated to send him money so he can pay for his mother's elder-care. But more than swindling money out of restaurant patrons, he makes them feel like heroes, validating their need to say that someone owes them his/her life.           Choke is a deep piece of literature, challenging the concept of why we attempt to get ahead in life, and questioning just how much we benefit (or suffer) from our knowledge. While set against the surreal backdrop of \\"beauty industry terrorism,\\" artificial insemination of Jesus' DNA, and life in Colonial Dunsboro, Victor speaks to the internalized struggle to know oneself in our modern times, and finding the courage not to accept the world for what it is.
B002436WJE|5.0|When Taken was finally released in North America, after already playing in Europe for a year, it became a surprise hit. Not bad for what is essentially a B-movie revenge story starring an A-list actor. The film was produced by French filmmaker Luc Besson, who's responsible for action classics like [[ASIN:B00008ZZ9E La Femme Nikita (Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0006GVJEE Leon - The Professional (Deluxe Edition)]]. He also produced and co-wrote the popular Transporter films so he certainly knows what audiences around the world want to see.<br /><br />The film delivers exactly what it promises: an excellent and entertaining thrill ride with no frills. It is as single-minded as its protagonist's mission and plugs in exciting car chases, fight scenes and gun battles. And yet, you are still emotionally invested in Neeson's character - you care about what happens to him and his daughter. The result is a truly satisfying and engaging film.<br /><br />You have the option of watching the theatrical version or the unrated cut.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Pierre Morel and cinematographers Michel Abramowicz and Michel Julienne. They decided on two distinctive looks for the film: sunny and vibrant colours for Los Angeles and a darker vibe for Paris. They talk about the differences between American and French film crews. They also praise Liam Neeson's ability to play a loving father and a deadly killing machine. They also talks about the challenges of working in a city like Paris.<br /><br />Also included is a commentary by co-screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen. He mentioned that he's been writing for 30 years with 15 of them with Luc Besson. They met on [[ASIN:B0006GVJE4 The Fifth Element (Ultimate Edition)]]. He worked with the filmmaker on creating a production company in Europe writing \\"low-impact action movies.\\" Kamen says that the premise of the film was based on a story Besson heard from a French cop. Kamen also talks about how he writes with Besson and praises his \\"cinematic vision.\\"<br /><br />\\"Le Making Of\\" is fairly standard if not engaging press kit material with the main cast talking about their characters and the story with clips from the film. There is plenty of behind-the-scenes footage of some of the film's exciting action sequences being shot.<br /><br />\\"Avant Premiere\\" features footage of the film's world premiere in France with Neeson, Morel and Besson doing interviews on the red carpet.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|When I first heard the song \\"Viva la Vida\\" at a friend's request, I wasn't sure I liked it. But there was some kind of catch to it that said, \\"Listen to me again.\\" So I did. When I listened to it a third time, I was hooked.    For me, some songs stand out as giants. They hit me at the right time, at the right place, and in the right way, and they remain favorites for years. \\"Viva la Vida\\" was one of those. I was enchanted by the unique subject matter and the beautiful imagery conveyed by the equally beautiful lyrics. I loved the melancholy, and most importantly, I loved the story it told. So I decided to buy the CD.    At first, I thought this CD was a dud. I loved \\"Life in Technicolor\\" and \\"Viva la Vida,\\" and for a long time, the other songs simply irritated me. They seemed rather plain overall, and a little too sad on the whole. Several songs changed tempo and melody mid-song, which annoyed me at the time. I moved them from my mixes for a month or so. On a whim one day, when I was looking for a change of pace, I moved them back. I'm very glad I did; slowly, but surely, each song began to open up. First, \\"42,\\" then \\"Lost,\\" and \\"Strawberry Swing,\\" until I could listen to every song on the CD and love every minute of it.    What is difficult to hear on first hearings is that underneath the melancholy of these tunes is defiance. \\"I don't want to follow Death and all his friends,\\" \\"Just because I'm hurting, doesn't mean I'm hurt,\\" \\"people moving all the time inside a perfect straight line, don't you want to curve away?\\" What makes it melancholy is that there isn't much hope of winning; but there is a paradox in that the singer lingers in hope. He hopes he can make it, even if the odds are all against him; he holds to it even though it makes no logical sense to do so. I found that extremely attractive. So, in its own way, this album is optimistic.    Certainly, there are lyrics that linger on failure of reaching that ultimate goal (\\"You thought you might be a ghost; younever got to heaven, but you made it close\\"; \\"I was held from the rooftop and they let go\\"), but the sensation here is that he's still fighting to win. Not only is he still fighting, he is doing everything he can: \\"God, only God, knows I'm trying my best!\\" That's the overall feeling of the album: reaching up through devastation, striving and struggling to do one's best, and knowing that that's all one can do.    This was a unique CD for me. I fell in love with the lyrics and then the tunes followed after. I had to give it a couple of months, but it proved to be a great purchase in the end. I now rank it as one of my favorite albums.
B000093FLA|5.0|When people see the title of this review they will probably think I am crazy, but its no joke...this movie delivers on all aspects, and is a true gem that I wish everyone would just give a shot...fans of Guy Ritchie will find nothing new in the flow and style of the movie but the characters in the movie is what truly makes it something special...you will find yourself rooting for some and jeering at others...Guy was able to successfully create a different personality for every character and give them their own identity. When you are dealing with so many characters that is def hard to do and pulls it off with this one...the cast and the story are spectacular and I feel that if given a fair shot with anyone, they will enjoy this movie all most as much as I did

I've seen it 3 times now and enjoyed it every time.
B000AARKOO|3.0|Seems historically accurate, at least as much as possible while still having Hollywood fun. The ending also doesn't feel as fulfilling as you believe it will be as you watch.    Pros:  -Stunning visuals  -Adrenaline pumping sword-fight scenes    Cons:  -little or no comic relief. It becomes maybe too intense  -Slightly anticlimactic.
0975991477|5.0|Simple writing, clear ideas, clear language. I was looking forward to read it since I knew it was published and finally I got it. I honestly think that this book should be read by everybody given the variety of religions that live together in every contry around the world. And, given the research advances we got every single day in genetics science, it is absolutely needed to keep clear our horizon. Lipton view about development is fresh and keeps your mind actively thinking all throught the book.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I heard a friend's copy and knew I needed my own. I like Chris's other harder music, but I also like electronic beat music and this gets me drumming on the steering wheel. The songs don't all sound alike and none are a dissapointment.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|After reading numerous reviews on this product, I decided to give 2 of them a go for a dual display setup.  I have a Studio RTA Producer Station desk with the monitor bridge across the top.  With my studio monitors, plus an Acer 23\\", space was at a premium up there, and I had to have my second screen 90 degrees to my left on top of one of my keyboards.  PAIN IN THE NECK, literally, from turning my head back and forth.  Mounted up my 17\\"HannsG and it went up effortlessly.  Holds tight and easy to move around, if needed.  Although I don't plan on it.<br />The aforementioned Acer 23\\" was a little lower than my neck was really comfortable with, even on top of the bridge of my desk.  Love that display, HATE the factory stand.  **Note, most reviewers I've read have maxed out at about a 19 or 22\\" screen.  My Acer is under the weight limit of the moutn (18lbs) so I thought I'd try it.  Slapped the adapter (75mm to 100) on the arm and the display now magically hangs right where it needs to.  I will definitely be getting another one of these if I ever need another one.  FOr the price, you can't beat them!
B001SO69IY|5.0|This album in one word \\"FIRE!\\"    I don't know when was the last time I ever heard an album that was great from beginning to end, every song will have your attention, from the slow one, to the mellow ones, to the club one and the rest, just something to bump to. Don't be suprised if you find 80% of this album being played in clubs...it's just that great.    Redman and Method man really brought Hip Hop back to where it supposed to be. It's not that gang banging crap that we are used to hearing now, that's the same reason why most people now turn to internet and satellite radio, because of it.    Blackout 2, really out did the first black out, even though I still listen to the first one to date. If you are a fan or REAL HIP HOP, and actually listen to music, and not just play it, then this album is for you. This is an instant classic, and after this album, I'm hoping Wu-Tang, Def Squad, and Gilla House release another album together once again.
B000002WEW|5.0|I ordered this as a gift and had it delivered to the recipient. They were thrilled with the merchandise. Delivery was fast and item in perfect condition. My friend said they thoroughly enjoyed both the CD and the Video.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|There's not enough good things that can be said about Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.     It's simply stunning.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Meryl Streep is the finest actress living today and this movie easily proves it. Her performance as the mean, cold, selfish, super-bitch principal of a Catholic school in the Bronx winter of 1964, who trys to destroy the career of the loving, giving, good-hearted father of her church was outstanding. All other players including Philip Seymour Hoffman as the kind father gave outstanding performances. This top notch film is one of the best pictures of the year and a must see.
0312360266|3.0|Three things I loved: Interesting concept, intriguing characters, compelling plot.    Three things I didn't love: Plot holes, over zealous pop-culture references, over-the-top sexual references.      Overall, I enjoyed it and recommend it for anyone over age 16.  However, there are some sexually graphic word choices and references to oral sex which I do not feel are appropriate in a book labeled \\"young adult\\".    I wished a few of the plot details weren't so similar to Twilight, but that is a minor gripe.  The plot was compelling and the characters were interesting enough that you began to care about what happened to them.  This story sets a pretty interesting foundation for the rest of the series.    What I didn't like is that some of the writing was a little rough.  They jump headlong into the story without any kind of establishment of how \\"Vampyres\\" fit into society and why they're allowed to go into human high schools to \\"mark\\" new recruits, effectively ripping them from their lives and families to live out the next few years at the House of Night (vampyre \\"finishing school\\") where they will either become a vampyre, or their bodies will reject the \\"change\\" and they will die.  One would think there would at least be better anti-vampyre security at high schools, but none of this is ever addressed.  There were other plot holes and discrepancies, too... like why Zoey's best friend and \\"almost\\" ex-boyfriend shunned her when they discovered she had been marked, yet they inexplicably show up at the House of Night days later to \\"break her out\\".  Not only does it seem contextually unlikely, but it seems incongruous that humans would show up at a school full of vampyres and vampyre fledglings.  Another gripe-- the pop culture references were way over the top in the first half of the book, to the point that it was just obvious it was written by a couple of adult women who were trying too hard to sound like teenagers.  Instead of pulling you into the book, it ripped you right out.    Still, despite these gripes and a few others, I did not once feel compelled to put the book down and not return to it.  I read it in a short amount of time, and fully intend to pick up the next one.  My hope is that the writing will even out as the series progresses, and even if it doesn't, it's not so awful that you can't look past it with a little effort... you'll want to, so that you can find out what happens next.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|a great addition to one of the greatest albums of all time.  the unplugged stuff is great and so are the extra tracks on the redux album.  if you are a pearl jam fan, this is a must have.
0743216458|1.0|I never received the product I ordered and the seller will not answer my email!
0765342294|5.0|This is a great read and a classic sci fi story.  It opens the mind up for thought on a wide variety of topics including war, imperialism, government, good vs evil, genetics etc.  A large portion of it is about the changes the main character, Ender, goes through.  Towards the end however, the books offers several plot twists that really deliver and set up the stage for the series.
B0029OYPLK|5.0|unbelievably awesome!!! My two favs on one stage! Its great to see songs like Split Decision and Forever man on here!! The DVD is a must have as well. Anyone who gives less than 5 stars must have cotton in their ears!
B001TH16DS|4.0|I bought the HD DVD version and now the blu-ray. I have to say that the HD was better from a picture standpoint (same TV). The blu-ray has better packaging.<br /><br />Will I buy the rest of the original series on blu-ray? Yes. I owned it on VHS. Then DVD, the re-released DVD, and now blu-ray. I'm a die hard fan! It is too bad that it wasn't originally shot in widescreen, stereo.
0061134007|5.0|This is a tour de force by an author who really knows what he's doing.  This is a procedural that is so full of surprises and intrigue that the reader can only marvel at the author's skill.  This is not a book thrown together so casually that it can be read on a long airplane trip by a reader half juiced and half awake.  No, this is a book that was built sentence by sentence, with a complexity that would fail in the hands of a less qualified author.  The book takes us from the eastern front of WWII where Norwegian traitors abetted the Nazi cause, to moden day Oslo where war memories and emotions can still run deep in a country that would rather forget the past.  I found this a compelling novel, well worth the reader's time.  Five stars!
0307408833|4.0|This is partly a recap of other reviews, but I felt strongly enough about it to add my two cents.    Yes, it's a beautifully made cookbook with mouthwatering photos, plus it's pleasant to read. The recipes are for both good comfort foods and ones with a twist. They all sound fabulously yummy.    However, I got a bad feeling when she insisted repeatedly that you had to follow her directions exactly and to expect some failures. Any experienced baker knows that such things as humidity and altitude affect baking, and we don't all live in NYC. I've been baking gourmet desserts for over 20 years. Following her directions exactly, my results were less than perfect, and I've had to make modifications (mostly concerning yields/pan sizes and cooking times). Apparently she didn't have anyone do home-kitchen tests. However, once you have a recipe figured out, the results are delicious.    I have recommended this book to others...but with caveats. I wouldn't recommend it to an inexperienced baker. And don't whip it out to make a recipe for the first time for the bake sale tomorrow!
B0006GQMC8|5.0|As much as I hate to do it, (Don't believe it) I must say something to the  Naysayers about this movie. I found it immensely entertaining. The acting  was excellent and the story unfolded in an interesting way. Did you know  that there was a real Albert Johnson (the Mad Trapper)? Of course this was  taken from a short story and made to fit the scenario they wanted so there  are only a few facts thrown in. Who cares, eh? We all want to be entertained  and to get away from some to the supposedly great movies Hollywood is dishing out today. If you don't want to see it that is easily done. The DVD  is almost impossible to find, now. All your troubles are over. If you can't  buy it, you don't watch it!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|The right CD, wrapped and shipped promptly.  Good music if you like Pink.  What else can you ask for?
0749453893|5.0|This book is very well written.  I like what the authors have done to preface each chapter with what they term \\"Our Chapter Pledge to You.\\" This gives the reader a very good understanding of what they will learn in that particular chapter.<br /><br />The authors do a good job of explaining the history of digital marketing, and cover very important topics that any business owner can relate to. I.E. - Strategic thinking, Website Intelligence, return on investment, Social media, email marketing, and fostering an online image, etc.<br /><br />This book is concise, practical, and very easy to implement into your business now.  I recommend this book.
0439023483|5.0|This book will keep you turning the pages to see what will happen to Katniss, our narrator, as she competes in the ultimate reality show, a competition to the death pitting teenagers from across the country against one another.  Katniss has to not only learn to embrace her bloothirsty nature, but also her compassionate one.
B001IZFXMQ|2.0|World War Z is a wonderful book and I felt shortchanged with the audio book version.  It is well acted and still has an impact, but there is an entire story missing regarding a character that directly interacted with the blind Japanese swordsman, as well as the fate of North Korea and Russia. I thought these were very important aspects in the story and should never have been left out.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Breaking Bad is great entertainment in character study.  The actors play their roles to the letter and the viewer can feel their frustrations and pain by the way they play out these roles.  The series is very well done.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|I didn't start watching Fringe until January and had to catch up on Hulu but the second half of the season it turned into my favorite show this year.
0156034026|3.0|I started to read this book by accident, I had to deliver it somewhere but I read the first pages because I din't have anything else for the subway ride.<br /><br />In this respect is very interesting it hookes you up from the first few pages, the story is told as it is a conversation with an american turist, the initial idea is good, but then due to the frequent interruption from the underlying story, it becomes to my opinion a little distacting and even annoying.<br /><br />The analysis of the Changez life, the ambition, the hunger, the difficulties of a foreigner in the US are done very well, probably the best part of the book, the relationship with her female friend is also good, specially the reflection that Changez does of his feeling, but she seems to bee a little too messed up to be a believable charachter and the end of the relationship is a littel too dramatic for the general tone of the book.<br /><br />I also personally think, as I read on other reviews that Changez final decision to leave the USA and go back to Pakistan is not delivered with the accurate depth. It seems to me that such a change of heart must have more deep motivation than \\" stick it to the man\\". I never heard that the reason that brings an emigrant to go back to his own country is basd on Political ideology, there is much more involved than this, family, economical reasons, convenience, quality of life. For sure in a novel it is not so sexy to go back home because you miss your family but agin the motivation is not properly delivered. In general it is a good reading, very good build up, conclusion a little weak.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I cannot say how insipid this entire collection of music is.  It's hard to tell where one song ends and another begins, because they all sound the same.  The arranger Claus Ogerman has slowed every song (except So Nice) to a crawl, the rhythm is half time, and Diana sounds as if she is singing in her sleep.  You just want to say: \\"spit it out, just sing the song!\\".  I own several Diana Krall CD's, and have shelled out money to attend concerts, so I am not quite a causal fan.  I love her music, this is NOT HER MUSIC!   I bought the CD because of \\"Quite Nights\\", a particular favorite; it was butchered, I just wanted to cry.  There is no heart in this piece of work and is beneath Diana.  Each and every song has the potential to be great, and is when sung by so many others.  The only song worth listening to is \\"So Nice\\", tempo and rhythm are there, and she sounds as if she is having a good time with it.  I wasted my money, don't waste yours.
0316776963|1.0|A complete waste of time. One wannabe funny story after another from a guy who people revere as the humor writer emeritus. I got angrier and angrier after every chapter and said to myself 1.) why am I wasting my time and 2.) why has everyone I ever met liked this book and held it up to some higher standard of humor. And the worst part is that you get from Sedaris the feeling that he doesn't even care about writing or being funny or being human. His stories are no better. funnier, or more strange than anybody else's. This book was on a 'to read' list of mine for years and it was such a let down. I hate myself for having read it.
0061251305|5.0|This book gives an original and unique perspective on the dynamics of naturally occuring groups within organizations.  It is a useful tool for understanduing company and inter-personal dynamics in multiple situations.  It is easy and enjoyable to read.
B001V7YWTQ|4.0|I love both these musicians and have seen them many times over the years.  I was never that impressed with Blind Faith and did catch them at MSG in 1969.  I thought both artist published much better material within other groups or alone although Can't find my way home is one of my favorite songs.  The camera work is great, the performances balanced between Clapton and Wynwood and the playing and singing is spirited.  My only complaint is: I wish Eric would publish some new music.  It's hard for me to get excited about listening to Crossroads, Tell the Truth, etc. after all these years.  This is my issue, as I buy everything he publishes and have many versions of most of these numbers. I was glad to see them perform \\"Sleeping in the Ground, Them Changes and Vodoo Child. The backing band is Eric's people with Willie Weeks, Chris Stanton and Ian Thomas on drums. All very able players.
0393320928|3.0|If you're a Feynman fanatic, you're sure to enjoy this even though the content is erratic and not as good as Surely You're Joking.<br />If you haven't read Surely You're Joking, read that first. It's better.<br />Okay, you're back from SYJ. Are you a Feynman fan now? If not, then skip this book. If yes, then you'll probably buy this book anyway just to get your hands on anything Feynman.<br />The beautiful epilogue (a Feynman speech on the value of science) is the best, and those half dozen pages made me feel I got my money's worth in the purchase of the book.<br />The section on the space shuttle investigation was pretty good, but you can find a better treatment of the subject (and a whole lot more good reading) in Ed Tufte's book, Visual Explanations.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Nothing new to add that has not already been said in other reviews.  Safe to say that this controller is a must for a PS3 gamer.  The dual shock feature is something I expected in the PS3 after having enjoyed it with the PS2. I am glad that it is now included with the PS3.  Ordering from Amazon was a breeze.  No problems.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I purchased this product for my mother for Mother's Day. When I went over to deliver it to her, she almost squealed at me she loved it so much. Now, I will say that I am not a huge fan of Star Trek, in fact I have never seen any of the movies or anything other than late night TNG episodes, but watching this with my mother has made me a huge fan.     She opened it up post-haste and instead of going out to eat like I had planned, she just wanted to order a pizza and us watch it. What I watched was some of the best acting for a television show of its time. But enough about that, you all want to know what it comes with it, what it looks like, and the sound and picture quality, right?     Well, to that, I will say you will not be disappointed in this purchase at all. The collection itself comes in a very large Blu-ray case that is encompassed by a thin card-board cover. All of the discs are in the case on a sort of \\"hinge\\" system, on one each side. My only complaint about the set is that the last disc, which is on the backside of the case, always seems to fall out for me, I'm not sure if it does for anyone else. It was out of its holder when my mom first opened up, and even when we place it there and hear the little 'snap' confirmation of it being in, it tends to fall out anyway. There is no sort of book on the inside, the only paper-related things are little ads for up-coming Star Trek releases. Oddly enough, there isn't an ad for the new movie, which I found very weird.     The picture and sound quality are top-notch. If you have an HDTV (which, if you own a blu-ray player, I don't see why you wouldn't) that handles 1080p, you will not be disappointed in what you see when it starts playing. If you have a 7.1 sound system, I would assume you wouldn't either. While I have one at my house, my parents only have a 5.1 capable system, and even THAT sounds amazing. In terms of the new \\"enhanced graphics\\" that they advertise, it isn't really anything to write home about. All it does it makes the \\"ship flying in space\\" scenes look newer, which creates a stark contrast to when the actual actors are on screen. For the opinion of a an actual Star Trek fan, I will quote my mother; \\"It's neat, but I prefer the original graphics myself. I can see why they did it though, for the younger fans.\\"     In terms of the extras added, I cannot comment on it because during my visit we didn't check them out, after I had left and a week had passed, my mother said it's really neat to hear and see the behind-the-scenes stuff, so I'm assuming it's good.     Wrap up: If you're a fan of Star Trek and want to own the original season on Blu-ray? You cannot beat this price. You get 24 hours worth of a Blu-ray enhanced classic Star Trek goodness, and if you're as big a fan as my mom, you'll love it. The picture and sound quality are next to none, and the extras included will have you watching the episodes again and again. This is a must-have for any Trekkies, and for this price? You're crazy to pass it up.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|About freakin' time, HBO - it was one of your best shows (albeit a very short one) in the past 5-6 years (Band of Brothers and Angels in America are the other ones), why did you drop it it's still beyond me...<br /><br />Looking forward to get my hands on it - hopefully HBO won't forget to use their tasty DTS-HD Master Audio encoding...

1439138311|1.0|I have been a big fan of Toibin for several years. The Heather Blazing is one of my all time favourite novels. The Blackwater Lightship was excellent. The Master is very different to those earlier works, but hugely entertaining and compelling.     Brooklyn does not even begin to approach the standards Toibin has set for himself. In fact, I am sorry to say Brooklyn is an abject failure by any standards. It and the Sea by John Banville are the worst books I have read in the last eighteen months. (Banville is an appalling writer with a nauseating personality who should never have been published so the fact that the Sea was such a poor book was no surprise).     Brooklyn is flat and dull. This, incidentally, has little to do with Toibin's famously economical prose style - which I love. The principal problem is with characterisation. The characters are cardboard cut-out, lacking in complexity, unrealised and utterly unconvincing. The central character is so passive that it is scarcely believable and she simply can not sustain my interest. Toibin indulges in long descriptive passages telling us about his protagonist's state of mind, her intentions and reasons and her reflections on events. Very rarely however is any of this conveyed in conversation between the characters. There are very few passages of dialogue - certainly any meaningful dialogue. This, for me, is a telling manifestation of the characterisation problem. Toibin can not give these characters a voice - because he does not really believe in them. You combine this with a very dull chronology of events that is the framework for the story and really, you have nothing.     I completely disagree with the reviewers in the British media and the New York Times who are falling over themselves to find the positives in this novel. One reviewer suggests that the novel is in some way deceptively simple and subversive. So I suppose if you disagree with them it's just because you were not sufficiently alert or intelligent to see the subversion. Nonsense. They are being hugely dishonest about all this - why, I do not know. Toibin's editors and publishers are advising him badly and must only be interested in promoting him as a literary star - thereby promoting themselves.
B00004XQ83|5.0|the product was exactly what i wanted and was in the condition the seller said it was thanks!
1582701709|2.0|The idea that one can acquire ANYTHING they want is somewhat laughable.  I mean, I want the ability to fly by jumping off a roof and flapping my arms.  If I \\"believe\\" hard enough, will this happen?  I wouldn't bet on it.  Of course, I guess you could chalk it up to the fact that I have too much doubt.  That's where the trickiness of the book comes into play.  If something good happens, it's because of The Secret.  If something bad happens, you just didn't believe in The Secret enough.  Right.  Also, the idea that everything bad that happens to you is a direct result from your thinking is just ridiculous.  The book is essentially saying that people WANT bad things to happen to them.  People WANT to be raped, murdered, kidnapped?  What?!?   On the other hand, I do believe in the power of positive thinking.  I think the book is right in that your thoughts have a lot of influence over your life.  As a psychology major, I definitely agree with this.  There have been countless studies showing how thinking positively can influence your health, happiness, etc.    Overall, the underlying premise of positive thinking is one that I can support.  However, I think The Secret, and the dozen or so life coaches that provide quotes for it, takes this way too far.  If you want to read the book, read it for it's general idea of thinking positively and how that can change your life.  Please don't actually buy into the idea that the \\"universe\\" will give you every little wish your heart desires.  Isn't that one of the first things we learn as a child?  You don't always get exactly what you want so be happy with what you've got.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|The series \\"Lost in Austen\\" is fantastic.  This DVD is not.  The editors cut out about half of the material.  If you didn't see the original, you don't know that the reason that Charles says he would go downtown when he's lonely is that Amanda sang Petula Clark's \\"Downtown\\".  It also makes no sense for Mrs. Bennet to say that Amanda is a bad influence on Lydia, unless you had witnessed the (cut) scenes where Amanda makes comments that Lydia uses later.  It is a shame that the whole series is not on the DVD.  It really was a great production.
B0002199H2|4.0|Arrived in good time and was well priced for the condition of the product.    jeremy
0783229372|5.0|The sets and cast are really great in this movie. Apparently sabatoge has been ruled out as to the cause of the disaster but it still holds up as reasonable and believable. George C. Scott and Ann Bancroft really \\"do\\" it for me!
B0018CWESK|5.0|this has to be one of the best movies ever! I love how they brought all the classic Universal Studios monsters to life,Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale were awesome!!!the story was very imaginitive!
B00009NH5W|5.0|I have fallen in love with TTD and his voice all over again. What a range and a variety of style this man has! He changed his name for personal reasons...but to me, the name, \\"Terence Trent D'Arby\\" is just as strong today as it was the first time I heard his voice (Wishing Well, Dance Little Sister and the seductive, Sign Your Name). Pay special attention to the lyrics. Listen as he plays his voice like an instrument. Listen to the music...then blend them together into one melodious Treat! Enjoy!
B001UREJWM|5.0|This is NOT Dehumanizer II or any of that other bull***t people are trying to tell you!  I remember when `Dehumanizer' first came out and the production came across very soulless and sterile and basically ruins the album.  Luckily those songs have their own presence and are much better live.  This album however has great production and the more I listen the more it sounds like it was produced in the 80's by Martin Birch, you in the know will understand the gravity of that statement. I even played them back to back and compared the song writing and production and 'The Devil You Know' is a far superior album.  I have over a 1000+ pieces of music, including vinyl, tapes, cds etc., so I rarely find myself playing the same thing twice in a row.  But this is that unique circumstance where I've listened to this about seven times, doesn't sound like a lot I know, and I wake up in the morning singing the f***ing songs and humming them throughout the day.  Even the songs I wasn't initially crazy about like 'Rock N Roll Angel', 'Breaking Into Heaven' and 'The Turn Of The Screw' now flow nicely with the album and are great songs.  I didn't even get into 'Heaven and Hell' and 'Mob Rules' this quickly!  This is destined to be a classic.  I would go as far as to even say this is an instant classic.  If they're going to make albums like this I hope they stay together for as long as they can because the band chemistry is as powerful as ever and is still very apparent on this album.  Overall this has the undeniable magic of a classic Dio/Sabbath album and the Devil's fingerprints are all over it.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|As someone who is completely against modernizations, remakes, etc. I thought the idea of remastering the original Star Trek series was an abomination. Why? Aside from making more money for the company, what was the purpose? I thought the idea was as idiotic as Spielberg replacing guns with walkie-talkies in E.T.<br /><br />However, I accidentally bought the remastered version of season 3 without knowing that I had. I watched through my new DVD copies of seasons 1 and 2, and then started s3 and my first thought was...\\"didn't the budget go down for the last season and not up? Why does everything  look so good?\\" I only then double checked the box and realized that I'd somehow gotten my hands on the remastered release. And I must say, it's AMAZING. The quality of the picture is greatly enhanced and instead of a little plastic toy flying around different colored glowing balls, a fully constructed digital Enterprise is flying around beautifully realistic planets. The phasers look fantastic. Everything is glorious. Of course, the original releases have a certain charm that can't be replaced, but if I could choose just one to have, the new releases are much more visually pleasing and only add to the show rather than taking away from it.<br /><br />I've recently sold off all three seasons and just bought the remastered original series pack as a complete set. At the moment, I'm anxiously waiting for it to arrive. I can't wait to go back and watch the first two seasons all over again with the enhancements. Despite previous biases, I fully approve!
B001SO69IY|5.0|The chronically dope duo is back. A simultaneously gutter and sky-high album that will have hip-hop heads everywhere putting one in the air.  Even after all these years, when it comes to weed-smoking, skull-stomping hip-hop no one does it better.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This is not a typical musical. The ABBA music tell the story (with help from some high profile actors) without distracting from it. Might just ware out the DVD
B000067CPX|4.0|As a long time RHCP fan I have always appreciated their changing and evolving style. Interestingly many of Anthony's lyrics that I thought didn't mean anything and were just there to rhyme, were revealed to have great meaning after reading his book.    Anyway, a heap of great songs on the album and John's guitar playing is awesome. Whenever I need an epic track to lift me up I put on \\"Don't Forget Me\\" so loud the windows rattle, incredible base line and the guitar breaks are inspired. \\"I'm the blood stain on your shirt sleve\\" \\"I'm the rainbow in your jail cell\\".    No they aren't still doing what they were doing 20 years ago, thankfully.
B00133KFGW|5.0|ORIGINALLY I SAW THE MOVIE ON HBO AS MANY TIMES AS IT APPEARED. THEN I GOT SICK OF WAITING  FOR IT TO COME ON AGAIN. I RENTED AUGUST RUSH FROM THE LIBRARY AND PLAYED IT OVER AND OVER. THEN I FINALLY BOUGHT IT FROM AMAZON.IT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE AND THE MUSIC AS ABSOLUTELY MESMERIZING.  HOW COME A MOVIE IS SO GREAT ( AND I KNOW THE OUTCOME ) THAT I WANT TO SEE AND HEAR IT ALL THE TIME?
B000HCO83Q|1.0|What can I say? This film was a huge disappointment after the first two. I wasn't expecting exactly the same, but I was not expecting it to be this bad.<br />The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the actors and cinematography is good, the script however is awful.<br />They throw in way too many characters, even for a fan like me, and throw get rid of key people like used Kleenex.<br />My hope is that Bryan Singer will return and make another film to make up for this one, but it's a long shot.<br />Not worth it.
B001TH16DI|4.0|This first part of this review is going to highlight one aspect mainly and that is the extra disc included called, \\"The Summit\\". Epic. It is pure gold. Not only as a fan of Trek, but of those actors and the lifestyle of their world.<br /><br />With \\"The Summit\\" we not only get a VERY candid and HONEST Q/A session of Frakes, Shatner, Nimoy and Stewert, we get a glimpse in to their day to day thoughts as actors talking to other actors and as people talking to other people. It's brilliant.<br /><br />Sections of the round table are down right histerical and some are wholy uncomfortable, but it is a look behind the curtain any fan of the actors presented would kill to see.<br /><br />Now for the actual films...<br /><br />Transfers are very well done. The TrueHD sound is impactful. On the earlier films there is sadly some clipping of the levels, but that might have actually been in the original audio masters. The picture is pristine, and transfered with the right gamma corrections. 2:35:1 aspect is soley where Trek should live and it looks huge on a bigscreen.<br /><br />Note that these are the original theater releases of the films. You will not find the redone \\"Motion Picture\\" with new VFX in this collection. The rest of the films do not have the extra scenes added from the special editions. Frankly, I'm fine with that. The extras each film had added to it was really best left for the cutting room floor. The movies stand on their own as they were originally released.<br /><br />But be prepared for a double-dip. I am sure they will release the special editions later. Although the \\"Motion Picture\\" might be an issue. As the enhanced visual effects that were done for it were not generated at film resolution, but only at television resolution. Paramount did not want to pay for it back when this was done and those digital files from which those enhanced visual effects came from are long gone, as is sadly the Director.<br /><br />And as for Kahn being the only one to be truely HD in its transfer...well...it does look awesome. Does it look more awesome than the others? On my 32\\" 1080p Samsung, not really. On my 110\\" LCD projection...yes the other films are softer. But the other films starting with TrekIV used newer film stocks, lighting techniques and lenses and look better to begin with. So they don't suffer as much in a direct comparison to TrekII. Back to back TrekII and TrekIII...again on the 110\\" projection...you can see a difference. But it's far from terrible.<br /><br />LET ME STRESS THE OTHER FILMS LOOK GREAT. They are a tad softer than TrekII but they are in no means \\"upscaled\\" DVD as some have said in other reviews. That is simply not true. They were transferred in HD but they did not get the full-on film negative rescan like TrekII; is all. They \\"look\\" very HD, very clear and you can see all the tiny details.<br /><br />As for the scary comments that the movies look out of focus...heh...folks it's called Panavision lenses. The cinemascope anamorphic lenses they use back in the 70s through late 80s all suffered from very shallow depth-of-field. Look at all those classic films from that era! Alien, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard. All those films have vignette (edge of framing) out of focus and soft. It's just a technical aspect to that style of filming.Does it look more awesome than the others?

074758589X|5.0|What a great, sad story! I read his first work and bought five copies for friends. I only bought three copies of this one (which I think is an even better  book), less my friends think I'm made of money .  Those who read this book  should also read No god but God by Reza Aslan, to have a picture of Islamic practices from their inception, and see how the prophet Mohamed's practices have gone array.
B000089CKH|5.0|Often those into the \\"cool\\" indie music will give little attention to Nada Surf, most likely because of that fantastic but somewhat juvenille song 'Popular'. However, the vocals, lyrics and musical composure of the band are on display on this album in a very powerful and moving. Most people i've introduced to it, find themselves listening again and again to the songs as they absorb the inticate weave of melody, mood and guitar riffs.
B0016OMFPW|5.0|It's no mystery that this album is truly ear food.  I found myself immersed in the music, between the groove of it and the emotions it evokes.  Great Album!  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Jazz or even Funk.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Having watched the original series as a teenager, I was not too sure what to expect from this reincarnation of an American icon.  All I have to say is that I was not prepared for the next two hours.    There were familiarity as well as twists and turns with several shocks tossed into this stew.  At times I said to myself how could they do that or why change the original storyline?    At the end as the credits began and that music which we all knew so well, I said to myself that was exciting.  It all made sense.    There were some very sad scenes.  There were many heroic moments in the face of  death.    The Enterprise was a marvel to behold.  You could see how over four hundred federation representatives could fit on this flagship.    The actors did a noble job of living up to the legends with some twists.  The love interest was, well, you have to see it for your self.    If you go see this with a lot of Star Trek lore tucked away in your brain, be prepared to be unnerved.  If you know little of the original series or films, then this should give you a good introduction to the mythology which has been a part of our culture for the last 43 years.    Was it perfect?  No, but it came close.

B001FB55HG|5.0|I went last night with a buddy of mine to see the premiere of Terminator: Salvation, and let me just say we were both blown away! Coming in to the theater I was worried about were this series is going, specially after reading several reviews off Rottentomatoes site, and the reviews are not all that good. But after seeing this movie, I hope this new director can make another, if possible. You know, going into the film, and if you have seen all three previous alterations of Terminator, you should pretty much have the plot, although sometimes confusing, already figured out. There's a sneering little snippet on audio tape when Sarah Conner is verbally trying to explain to John Conner, the resistance leader, that trying to figure out time chronologically can be a massive headache, or something to that nature. I thought that was timely well put under the circumstances. But if you have watched Terminator 3, you can pretty much guess the next installment would easily take place into the future! And my Golly is about time. I remember watching the first Terminator in the theater, in complete awe, and more so whenever Kyle Reece had his flash backs. Every time the movie set you up into that time frame, it was like watching a whole new world unfolding before your eyes, and futhermore, you wanted to see more. It was a world familiar, but turned up side down as you had machines taking over the world. The plot was believable, familiar to the average viewer with every day events, and one could sense the gloom of humanity as we head into the future. That was then, and today, when you see Salvation, you will appreciate the level of detail leading up to Terminator 4. Personally, in my eyes, the first was the best, with a second being more of a recycle of the first, with pumped up special effects and a few added touches of advancing the story line. Part three was the most advance in the series that, again, advance the story line just enough to lead you up to the future, and again, part three was in its own rhythem an interesting take on the series, and only advancing it just enough for another sequel. Well, I'm starting to suspect the terminator series is going to be a long series, as these film companies are only pinching the plot very slowly, so they can get back and deliver another several years down the line. I'm ok with that, as I had yet to see a bad terminator flick, and every one of them have always been a true enjoyment in the theaters. When you pay, 9-10 dollars for your ticket, you'll feel coming out of it you got every penny spent. The set pieces, action, and overall look of the film is amazingly well put together, and the long-drawn out action sequences are some of the best kenetic explosions you'll see on the big screen. For the entertainment value alone, Salvation will not disappoint. It delivers in bucket loads. Nonstop action from beginning to end. The director wants it in your face, rub it in, and have enough of it that you come out the theater with bruises you can feel the next day. The audio, coupled with the explosions will rock and vibrate your seat 'till you drop your panties.<br /><br />  Now story wise, there's a twist with one of the characters in the film that actually works, even though you suspect there's something wrong from the beginning, the story unfolds and at the end the revelation is worthwhile and the twist is filling for an otherwise thin plot. Without this twist, you really don't have much to go on to advance the story line, after all, the last three films delved deeply into the plot and psycho-babble, and all you got really left is the scraps littered in the battlefield. The fourth installment dwells into the future, and after knowing everything heading into this film, there's not a whole lot a director can do to advance it, without running the risk of telling everything. Hence, you'll see another film, perhaps furthering the story  in small bits as usual, and tie some lose ends which the third revealed atthe end about john Conners future kids, and so forth.<br /><br />What I most enjoyed of Salvation?<br /><br />1)The effects and action sequences are long drawn out, unlike Michael Bays, short, and quick editing. The sequences are matured and advanced so you could see the whole playing field.<br /><br />2)The machines are vast and clunky, first-generation T-600 series. Moto-terminators are really more of a road killer machine than a walking, breathing cyborg, which you will see in the final action sequence, the T-800. The t-800 was design to infiltrate the human resistance network, which skynet could not penetrate, hence this is a mjor part of the story line in Salvation. Other killer bots are shown, including one that's taller than a two story building, and human-harvesting machines making you think the director is ripping off transformers, and War of the worlds.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />1)Thin plot, and character development is lacking. Although I must say, the plot, for what it is, is effective, and well handled.<br /><br />2)What most amazed me, no battle-scenes of hundreds of terminators were ever shown clump together fighting the resistance. Remember, the beginning of terminator 2? Walking cyborg killers roaming the landscape and terminating the resistance, while they fought back with their heavy guns? You won't see that here. You'll only see flying machines with their search lights seeking humans and destroying them in part 1, 2, and 3. Not part 4. Well, it amazes me the new director did not submit to the same tactics, and decided to shoot a barren landscape of ruble, and crumbled buldings, minus the army of killers wondering and searching for humanity to terminate. Hmm, interesting. I feel he failed to captured that gloom set in stone in parts one through three, and some of the more awe-inspiring elements of the series was missing.<br /><br />3)Pg-13 rating hurts it, and you can tell, as hardly any humans is cut down in pure blood by the manacing machines. The movie is darker in mood when compared to part three, but the lack of violence hurts this series. Please next installment bring in an R-rating. The movie has punch, blasting action, and killer explosions, but the violence is minimal, and at times it felt like a light terminator flick just to bring in a bigger audience into the theater. I think it cheapens it.<br /><br />Overall, another great flick. It has its weaknesses, but the overall product delivers in spades for an action junky like me. The story is not bad, and it shows a sprinkle why skynet decided to build more, sophisticated machines, and its continuos plot to terminate humanity. If it was not for the twist in Salvation, this movie would have fallen completely flat on its face. And this is another problem heading into another sequel. How do you create a protoganist without ruining skynet as the adversary? The director needs a star, and skynet needs another Arnold to build at least a descent story line without just falling into the same trap of fighting nameless/faceless machines, which in all purposes the audience is not going to relate or feel attached to again as the fourth already accomplished. We need an adversary that's hooked up to Skynet, and deliver its commands and phylosophy on the battlefield. One that can communicate and talk,and describe in its own words what it wants to achieve; its goals, its dreams, its awareness! If skynet did became aware, than it must think, and thereby, it must find its own solution to its ends. We need something like this in another Terminator. I want to know what the machines are plotting, its schemes, its awareness. I want to know if it can feel, and grow, and understand its scope of madness. In Terminator 2, the cyborg actually was learning how to be human, at least to some degree, it was hacked, but its computing power led it to grow as it communicated with Jonn Conner. I sure miss moments like that in Salvation. You can call it souless, heartless, or whatever, but watching through Salvation, you often wanted more of a soul on both sides of the fence. Anyhow, go see it for the spectacle that it is, and remember, Salvation is just the beginning.ee, but the lack of violence hurts this series. Please next installment bring in an R-rating.

0385340575|5.0|Shame on you Lee Child for not having pity on us working folks - am dragging as I write from staying up until 3 in the morning - poured through this voraciously flipping pages to see what happens next.  The phrase \\"grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go\\" as been overused but the clean sparing prose just dragged me in.  For those who were complaining about the detail overload or wordiness of Lee Child's last - here yah go - this one is stripped down with almost no warm fuzziness or backstory - you are just dropped into the middle of things.      It's brutal enough with plenty of twists - there were parts where I was thinking OMG.  How is it this guy can write in so much detail about weapons and it works so well, and then give you just enough detail in other parts that your mind fleshes things out?  This book reminds me of a favorite (\\"Persuader\\") and is pure Reacher, working more alone than I've seen in the other books - when it was over wanted to give the character a great big hug and a good meal.  Has one of Child's most disturbing villains yet - this book is like going outside of your nice warm house and getting slapped in the face with a freezing blizzard - so naturally I will be re-reading it this weekend.      Personally I would have liked more snarky moments and hated to see the character working so much alone, but again this one is stripped down and hard.  One cheery thing is that Child is working on the next Reacher novel, according to the back plate - for me it will be a LONG wait.
0756405890|1.0|I read the back cover and was captivated. Unfortunately, this is really hard to read; not a bad premise, but unable to get it out of second gear. Just painful to read at times and at other times vomit inducing. I finished it and I felt like it was like getting food poisoning. The writing's so bad it'll make you physically ill.    I had to force myself to finish it and then threw it in the trash when I did. (Pat, PLEASE, get an editor, move the story!) For Pete's sake, 620 pgs and NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. IF you consider buying this book, get the $.01 version, at least then you can use it as a cheap coaster on your coffee table. Is there a writer out there that could take another stab at this one?....it is in need of a re-write!
B0019X3ZZY|2.0|I had read De Sade's 120 days of Sodom before I watched this movie, which was a gut wrenching experience that definitely haunts me, but I couldn't bring myself to stop reading it.  It was page after page of some of the most perverse acts imaginable, which any effort to conceptualize a piece of work more disturbing churns my stomach.  It is simply some of the most discomforting, nauseating literature I've ever read, and I know it's going to continue to nag it's way into my thoughts for sometime to come.  With that being said, I can still appreciate, when I detach myself emotionally from the novel (albeit not an easy thing to do), the metaphor for the abuse of power.  The novel definitely gave me a closer perspective into the mind of someone truly sick, or a more fitting description, \\"sadistic.\\"    The film however, as disturbing as it was, pales in comparison to what is described in the novel.  What is being suggested is still very powerful, but will not leave you feeling nearly as ill as plucking the words off a page and feeding it to your own imagination.    It definitely aides the film to have read atleast excerpts from De Sades novel.  Watching the movie you'll easily be able to recall the scenes from the novel being replicated, but the scenes flashing through your mind will be infinitely more lurid, making the scenes on film seem quite tame.      It's a bit unsettling that I could watch a movie like this and be dissapointed with the shock value.  Maybe that's a statement about the novel in itself.    I must note that this isn't really a critique on the statement the film makes, which is powerful, and the imagery from the literature the film references definitely serves to strengthen it.  It's really a critique on the poor reenactment of De Sades work, which I understand would be difficult to create within legal boundaries.  However, I felt it was important to point out their relationship, and Salo is akin to a bowl of lucky charms when it comes to stomaching thehorrific work the film pays homage to.

B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Short Attention Span Summary:<br /><br />1. A boy is being smacked about by a Neighborhood Bully.<br /><br />2. During this smacking around, he discovers that he has the power to jump from one place to another.<br /><br />3. He uses this power to steal some things and make a good life for himself.<br /><br />4. There come these people that (for some reason that is never explained) want to kill the Jumpers.<br /><br />5. The first Jumper meets another jumper who is more experienced and we find that he has a plan to kill the Bad Guys.<br /><br />6. Eventually the Bad Guys are killed and the First Jumper Gets The Girl and the movie is over.<br /><br />Comments: Essentially, the special effects are great, but the plot is very silly/ corny/ thin. The female character was REALLY ANNOYING (do you know any normal people who have a voice like that?) and no explanation was given as to why this conflict existed. (This recalls the movie \\"Hancock,\\" where a conflict was made up for the point of the movie without any underlying explanation.) Or who was who and how they came to be who. Or how one of the Bad Guys ended up giving birth to one of the Good Guys.<br /><br />This is worth a DVD rental, but not a movie ticket. Lots of special effects, but not much more.
0199535639|4.0|A melodrama that includes thwarted love, a marriage of obligation, claims on inheritance, and the victimization of women, Women in White is also an engaging and absorbing mystery.  Author Wilkie Collins, often credited with being the father of the mystery genre, here creates a fast-paced story of Victorian England, revealing much about Victorian society and its values--the role of women, the laws governing marriage and inheritance, the social institutions of the day, the contrasting attitudes toward the aristocracy and the lower classes, and even the level of medical care and the treatment of psychological illness.<br /><br />When drawing master Walter Hartright is on his way to teach Marian Halcombe and Laura Fairlie at Limmeridge House, in Cumberland, England, he meets a \\"woman in white,\\" a young woman who knows Limmeridge House well because she was mentored by Mrs. Fairlie, Laura Fairlie's deceased mother. The \\"woman in white\\" is Anne Catherick, who looks just like Laura, but who is an escapee from a nearby mental asylum. Upon his arrival at Limmeridge House, Walter immediately falls in love with the beautiful Laura, but she has made a deathbed pledge to her father to marry to Sir Percival Glyde, someone Anne Catherick despises and blames for her own incarceration. Throughout the novel, Anne visits various characters to offer help in combating Sir Percival and his cohorts.<br /><br />The story unfolds through documents held by a variety of characters, each of whom tells the story from his/her own point of view. The reader develops sympathy for the innocent and beautiful Laura, respect for her homely but bright half-sister, Marian Halcombe, sadness for Walter Hartright, and hatred for Sir Percival and his friend, the Italian count Fosco, with whom Sir Percival is in business. Sir Percival and the count need financing, and it is Laura's inheritance that is at stake. A series of consecutive disasters, along with arguments, revelations of abuse, the fear of exposure, and the contemplation of murder by Sir Percival and Count Fosco, draws the reader irrevocably into the action.<br /><br />The characters are sympathetically drawn, with Collins showing an early awareness of the influence of psychology on behavior. The descriptions of nature, presented realistically and in minute detail, build suspense, as Collins creates parallels between nature and the details of plot. As is usually the case with romances, chance plays a huge role in the unfolding action, creating cliff-hanging suspense which contributes to the excitement--and pure fun--of this seductive novel. The conclusion, involving a subplot unrelated to the primary action, resolves issues conveniently. The almost-forgotten author of twenty-five novels, Collins was one of the most successful authors of Victorian mysteries, and he is gaining new attention as a result of reprints of this novel and The Moonstone.

0810993139|5.0|My favorite book that I read this year is Diary of a Wimpy Kid. This is my favorite book because it gives you tips about 7th grade. For instance, you might be sitting by annoying students, if you are a loud person then you might be bullied, and whatever seat you sit in on the first day of school is your permanent seat for the whole   year.                                              Kids that are in 3rd grade through 8th grade would like this book because if you are a kid that is being bullied you should learn some ideas so you could stop being bullied and if you are not in 7th grade maybe you could get a heads up about it.                                                        I could see many familiar problems as I read this amusing book. The character sits by poor students, he wrestles, and he doesn't like to get speaking parts in plays. That's how I am similar to the character. This was why it was the best book ever.    by: T.W.
B001UE276A|5.0|I thought this box set would consist of a CD sized box and a few pamphlets. I am a huge Depeche Mode fan, so I figured I'd bite the bullet. After receiving a surprise discount in price, my package arrived with so much content I haven't been able to go through all of yet. This is weeks later I'm talking about!  Warning: This is NOT Violator. You should have an affinity for Sounds of the Universe!   The box is a sleek work art itself, the  album is GREAT and the bonus tracks, books, movies and trinkets are truly worth the mail order wait. This is such a solid purchase of high quality. Every die hard  fan DM should consider owning this.
1439102813|5.0|This was one of the most thoughtful and provocative books I have ever read.  It was genuinely tender and tough all at the same time.  What a dreadful disease this Alzheimers is but the author kept the human emotion involved on a caring level.  I would recommend it for all ages as it is not morbid.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|My 1st purchase through Amazon and it went smoothly. I pre-ordered and they shipped in advance. got it 3 days ahead of schedule, on the release date. Great thing to come home to after a hard days work. :) I followed this show when it 1st aired last fall. If you are interested in another take in vamp history (so-to-speak) then you'll enjoy this show. All the characters are great and played very well by the actors. Can't wait to start season 2!! :D
0345479092|1.0|[[ASIN:0345479092 Secrets of the Baby Whisperer: How to Calm, Connect, and Communicate with Your Baby]]    Hyped by Random House publishers as \\"this groundbreaking book,\\"  readers are enticed by offers of \\"Tracy's Three Day Magic--how to  change any and all bad habits (yours and the baby's) in just three  days.\\" Which mother would not be happy to \\"get baby to eat, play, and  sleep on a schedule that will make every member of the household's  life easier and happier?\\" The very unpredictability of babies is what  makes new mothers' lives so chaotic. Mothers don't get coffee breaks,  lunch breaks, or go off duty at 6pm. It is plain, hard work taking  care of a baby.    Look in any bookstore or library and you will see pregnant women and  new mothers searching eagerly for advice on child raising. I remember  doing this myself, devouring every morsel. Think how many editions of  Dr. Spock's book have been sold over the years! Fashions change in  child rearing as in all things. We have gone from strict scheduling to  permissiveness and now we are back to scheduling again. Tracy Hogg's  \\"Secrets of The Baby Whisperer\\" is the latest in a long line of books  purporting to know \\"the right answer\\" to parents' concerns. As any  experienced parent will tell you, there is no \\"right\\" answer. What  works for one child will not necessarily work for another. Listening  to your baby is the first step towards understanding him.    So who is this wonderworker who can tell instantly whether a baby is  hungry, tired, in real distress, or just in need of a little TLC?    According to Newsweek magazine (...)(Feb 26, 2001 issue):  \\"A registered nurse in England, Hogg left her two daughters, then 8  and 11, with her mother and moved to L.A. in 1992. Unable to use her  nursing license here, she began taking care of babies. She had, as  they say in the movie industry \\"great word of mouth\\" and soon Hogg  opened her own baby-equipment store in Encino, CA. Her book and her  Web site claim that shegot a Master's degree in hypnotherapy from the  University of California, Irvine. But a University spokeswoman says  they have no record of her. Earlier, according to her book and Web  site, Hogg was \\"assigned\\" to the Great Orman Street Children's  Hospital,\\" an apparent reference to London's famed Great Orman Street  Hospital, where she, in fact, attended a three-weekend-long training  course. And a \\"stint with the World Health Organization in India\\"  turns out to refer to a two-week trip she took there in 1989.\\"    This leads us to ask, how good is the advice she gives?  Not very.    Despite being endorsed by celebrities like Los Angeles stage actress  Kate Mulligan who can afford $250.00 for \\"1 Hour Intense Consultation\\"  or $350.00 for \\"Baby's First Feed,\\" the information offered by Ms.  Hogg is out of date and inaccurate. While she is entitled to her own  personal opinions, they are not based on any scientific studies or  research. Moreover, much of her advice conflicts with that given by  the American Academy of Pediatrics who advocate feeding babies when  they indicate hunger rather than on artificial schedules.    Ms. Hogg's theories on infant sleep are also unfounded. They owe much  to the teachings of Gary Ezzo, the discredited author of \\"Babywise\\"  and \\"Preparation for Parenting,\\" which have also been heavily  criticized by the AAP.    Do we really need another parenting book that tells us that our  instincts are useless and if we would only follow this author's  theories all of our problems would be solved?    Rather, mothers - and fathers, too - are the real experts on their  particular baby because they live with him 24 hours a day. What we  really need are more books like \\"The Baby Bond: How to Raise an  Emotionally Healthy Child\\" by Dianna Hine and \\" The Baby Book:  Everything You Need to Know about Your Baby from Birth to Age Two, \\"  by Dr. William Sears and Martha Sears. These books help new parents to  meet their baby's basic needs through a loving, nurturing, attachment  style of parenting.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I've never had a movie make me really cry in my entire life but this one did. The ending is so powerful it grabbed me like nothing else I've ever seen on film. You must see this movie.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|This film tries to cotninue on in the understated vein of is predecessor, the excellent Casino Royale. Instead it is a tremoundous bore, quite possibly the worst Bond film ever made. The fimmakers' attempt to be realistic backfires, as the villains are boring and the action is anitclimactic. Just acept that Bond fans want over the top escapism, and don't sacrifice a good time for dry storylines.
B001UE276A|5.0|I really love the new album. There are lots of great songs - very spiritual and very powerful and I especially love Little Soul, Peace, Come back, Jezebel, and the bonus tracks Light, The Sun the moon and the stars, and Ghost.  Ben Hillier did a great job with the production and I was also impressed with a number of the demos from the box set. This album stands head and shoulders above any album of this decade - buy it!
B00005JNJV|5.0|The movie was awesome!! I think that goes without saying.     Love it in wide screen blu-ray 10 times more though.  If you can get this and Dark Knight both, do it. It will make for one fantastic movie watching experience.
B0009MAO46|2.0|I thought I was buying a New DVD, it was used. It had a couple of scratches and was not compatible to play on my DVD player.
1400063515|1.0|The subject is interesting enough, even though not exactly new:     - \\"All terrorists are Muslims\\" does NOT imply \\"all Muslims are terrorists\\"  - Not all random events follow the Gaussian Distribution  - Absence of Evidence is not the same as evidence of absence....    and the author has some interesting examples, where people do not take these facts into account.    The whole book however is marred by the terrible arrogance of the author. At least 15 times, we are reminded, that he can speak French very well, at least once ( in my recollection), that he also speaks German...(and of course English, Arabic.....)  Istead of simply telling something, he must point out, that this happened on his business class flight from Singapore to Paris (or Munich to Saigon, or.....).  Then it gets repetitive: As he apparently had many important trips (or parties or conferences...)which he must tell us about, and not that much of substance to say, he simply repeats the substance.    Without the arrogance (and hence 150 pages shorter) it would have been a good, maybe a very good book - but not as it is!!
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|AWESOME, is the only word to discribe this movie. The animation is beautiful, the fight seens are action packed. If your a fan of the Final Fantasy series or an anime fan-GET THIS MOVIE!
B001SO69IY|4.0|Red and meth back at it again. Together neither have lost a step. So old and new fans will be able to enjoy this album. Blackout 2 has the nice grimy beats with the dope lyrics of red and meth laid over them. The album caught my ear because it doesn't stray away from the formula that has made red and meth dope as individual emcees and together. They come with the raw lyrics and know how to deliver those rhymes over some good beats. The highlights of the album are the two songs with Keith Murray and Bun B. Blackout 2 is a respectable release and recommended.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:<br />I'm dope n@@ga<br />Errbody Scream<br />City Lights<br />Four minutes to lockdown
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|i enjoyed this movie...i thought the acting, casting, directing, etc. was excellent. i also felt it stayed true to F. Scott Fitzgerald.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I was on a flight home from a comic book convention. An episode was showing on the onboard television. When I heard the phrase \\"Klingon Boggle\\", I was instantly hooked. When the plane landed, I used the airport's wifi to order the Season 1 DVDs. I can't wait for this second season.
B00004UQBP|5.0|Great album, great early work.  Take it on its own and not evaluate it in terms of Dark Side of the Moon or Animals.
160459201X|5.0|I will make it short and sweet for the ones speculating whether to get this book or not..\\" This book is a must have\\" let me say this again. \\"This book is a must have!!!!\\" This is a golden opportunity to find answers to your questions-questions you didn't even know you had! That's how serious this book is..
B00007KQKM|5.0|Just after WWI, Sir Clifford Chatterley has inherited a large country estate and a title.  He is happily married to the beautiful Connie.  All would be wonderful, except Clifford is in a wheelchair due to injuries suffered in the war.  At first the Chatterley's try valiantly to keep that famous British stiff upper lip, but the devastating injury means life can never be the same for them.  Their marriage is now sexless, and there will be no children to inherit the title.  This takes a toll on their marriage, and Connie finds fulfillment in the arms of the gamekeeper.  But wait, it is completely unacceptable for a titled lady to become involved with a working class servant.  Had Connie chosen a lover of her own class, society would have turned a blind eye to it.  In fact, Sir Clifford had even suggested she should have an affair and have a child that they could raise as their own.  Even Connie's bohemian sister is shocked and disapproving of the affair with a rough laborer.<br /><br />Now, I did read the book, but that was so long ago that I don't honestly remember enough to know if this production is true to the book or not.  It seems to be, to the best of my recollection.<br /><br />This production is lavishly done.  The house and the scenery are beautiful.  I think at least some of the interior scenes were shot in the same house that was used in Gosford Park. At least, that staircase seems to be the same one.  Some reviewers have mentioned the terrible music.  I found out the rights for the music used when this program was broadcast were not available when the DVD was released, so other music was substituted.  It is repeated frequently, but it didn't bother me.<br /><br />All the actors do a terrific job, and I felt they were all well cast.  I suppose that one could argue that Sean Bean as Mellors is more attractive than he is described in the novel, but he still fits the role.  Joely Richardson is good as Lady Chatterley, but the two characters I found most fascinating were Sir Clifford and his nurse Mrs. Bolten.  We see Clifford trying to remain cheerful, trying to have a good attitude, but he slowly sinks into bitterness.  He becomes spoiled, short tempered, and self centered.  This down turn in personality is oddly encouraged by Mrs. Bolten.  Yet, she also befriends Lady Chatterley, while on the other hand, she appears to deliberately drive a wedge between the couple.  The role of Sir Clifford is played by James Wilby, who just seems to have a blast with the role, especially in parts three and four, when Clifford has gone over the edge.<br /><br />No review for this film would be complete without mention of the famous sex scenes.  Yes, there is a fair amount of nudity.  We even see Sir Clifford nude, including close-ups of bed sores on his buttocks.  (Imagine being the makeup artist with the task of creating fake bruising on an actor's behind.  Imagine being the actor.  LOL)  Also, there are quite a few sex scenes.  Here director Ken Russell does a good job of creating illusions that make you feel the sex scenes are more explicit than they really are.  The project comes across as quite sexy, but if you really stop to think about the sex scenes they aren't showing so much.  This is definitely a main stream movie, not softcore porn.<br /><br />I think this DVD will appeal to the sort of people who like Masterpiece Theater, Merchant Ivory films, and British costume dramas.

B001GCUO1G|4.0|That scene with Ryan Reynolds and those swords in the beginning - incredible. Aside from that, X-Men Origins is a pretty good movie (3 1/2 stars) that has a lousy ending.       You will enjoy everything about this movie if you are a fan of Wolverine; and the female fans get to see Hugh (twinkle-toes) Jackman in the buff. Liev Schreiber does a superb job playing Sabretooth - very convincing performance. We have some really good back-and-forth between Jackman and Schreiber that is one of the movie's high points. Mutant cameos by Cyclops, The White Queen, The Blob, Gambit and Professor X are a treat as well. I just wish the ending was a little better.
B0018TNMC0|5.0|I am a HUGE Clint Eastwood fan and I love all of his movies in any way but Clint on blu ray is a dream come true for all fans. They all havent come out yet but I have the ones that are. It makes an older movie look bran new and the old picture looks completly amazing. I would recommend all of his movies on blu ray cause its like watching a new movie all over again. Best choice
B001MEJY8W|3.0|Every time I see a movie like Martyrs, I think about Alfred Hitchkock and his aversion to show bloody murder scenes. Was all the blood necessary? I think the gore takes something away from the movie. I give this film more credit than a film like \\"Seed\\" due to its plot and its theme of the nature of evil.    The movie centers around a girl who was escaped from a kidnapper after being tortured. Years later, we see her graphically shotgun an entire family, believing that they were her captors. She calls a friend for help and she is horrified when she walks into the bloody scene.     The question: How crazy is she? Later in the film, the friend finds out when things get worse and the friend becomes the latest kidnapping victim in a diabolical scheme to, well, I don't want to give it away.     In between all the blood and torture there is something more going on in this film. The very last scene, if you make it that far, is very interesting. Some critics may also indicate that this film is totally unrealistic. To them I would suggest they google \\"European Children found in basement\\" sometime. The director, trading in stars for gore, admits that the violence is not everyone's cup of tea. I agree.
0312370849|1.0|Agree with reviewers who noted that the writing was juvenile. This was definitely not prose. Premise of story was good, and with another author who was more adept with words, this would have been an excellent read. As it was, there were passages in this book that read like a 5th grader had written it and made one wince to think that this book is reportedly so acclaimed. The author's bio notes she's been writing since she was 12 (?), well, seems like she still writes like a 12 year old.
B001TODCII|4.0|Taken is a very well paced thriller about an ex-CIA field agent who shoots his way through Paris looking for his kidnapped daughter. Liam Neeson does a good job playing the father, who kills a whole bunch of white slavers in the film (Interpol, please take note) while dodging bullets like Max Payne.    Despite the torture scene, I enjoyed this film. I actually wanted to see it in the theatre but it wasn't there for very long. I don't regret buying Taken since the DVD will be viewed more than once.
B00008PW3O|5.0|Fleetwood Mac has been touring recently; their first tour in a few years. So, naturally, seeing the \\"Unleashed\\" tour was number one on my to-do list. So, I did. I saw the legendary Fleetwood Mac in concert, where they played all their hits and not a single new song. It was a chance for them to really connect with the audience and play what everyone wanted to hear... and that connection was made. Had I not been in love with this band already, I would have fallen for them that night.    The first thing that I ever realized about Fleetwood Mac many years ago was that many songs I already heard and liked were all by this same band. When I made the connection is when I first started to like Fleetwood Mac. I was hypnotized by songs like \\"Dreams,\\" \\"Go Your Own Way,\\" \\"Landslide,\\" \\"Golddust Woman,\\" and \\"The Chain.\\" But wasn't until about a year ago that I really started to listen to Fleetwood Mac. The biggest thing about them that I came to love right off was the chemistry between two out of three of the singers: Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. The two had been in a relationship for a while by the time they joined the Mac in `75. By the time their second (and most popular) album was released, Buckingham and Nicks were already broken up and their tumultuous relationship was becoming strong with anger and hate. The said album, Rumours, truly reflected this, often called the \\"musical soap opera\\". Since then, the two have been a legend and their chemistry on stage remained a back-and-forth love/hate relationship. But one things was always true: they are musical soul mates.     This is what prompted me to want to write a Fleetwood Mac review. Originally, I wanted to do one of Rumours, but today I bought their most recent album, Say You Will, and I want to do a review of it instead. If someone would like a review of Rumours, please let me know and I will be happy to oblige.    On with the review:    1. What's The World Coming To: A Lindsey Buckingham song. Back to his normalFleetwood Mac-style song, he has a great opener here. It really reminds me of the kind of song he would have written in the seventies or eighties. \\"Everyone's gone to the moon/ What's the world coming to?\\" 5/5    2. Murrow Turning Over In His Grave: Written by Lindsey. A very fun song. I absolutely love it. It's purportedly about some media person from the fifties named Murrow, who would \\"turn over in his grave\\" if he could see how corrupt the media is today, built on lies and deceit. \\"Murrow turning over in his grave/ Ed Murrow had a child, the damn thing went wild.\\" 5/5    3. Illume (9/11): A song written by Stevie. One of her darkest songs, Stevie wrote it about the 9-11 tragedy. She was in NY the day that it happened and she could see the smoke from her hotel room. She wrote this song in a very dark moment and it really is a beautiful song from a very sad time. \\"I'm alone now with my thoughts/ Of how we could make it/ How we could get out/ What we've been through/ All of the trauma.\\" 4/5    4. Thrown Down: Written by Stevie. This may be my favorite song on the album. It's so beautiful and the guitar is so simple yet hypnotizing. One of Stevie's greater songs since the seventies. \\"Thrown down/ Like a barricade/ Maybe now he could prove to her/ That he could be good to her/ And they should be together.\\" 5/5    5. Miranda: Lindsey. Miranda is a yucky name. So is Diane, Lola, and Caroline. Why is Lindsey always writing songs about women with boring names? But these songs are always good! \\"Miranda is taking the stars down/ A little something to call her own/ But the lion still rules Miranda/ And Miranda is always alone.\\" 4/5    6. Red Rover: Lindsey. The guitar in this song is so cool! There are some sort of effects on it, but they are still so complicated and elegant, yet so fun and upbeat. Lindsey's vocals also make this song really awesome! \\"Red rover, red rover, red rover/ We've come, we've come, we've come to take you over.\\" 4/5    7. Say You Will: Stevie. Though it's the title song, this one doesn't do a whole lot for me. I like it a lot, don't get me wrong, but it may be my least favorite on the album. I really like the verses, but the chorus repeats too many times at the end... and what's with the boy's choir? \\"Say you will, say you will/ Give me one more chance/ At least give me time to change your mind/ That always seems to heal the wounds if I can get you to dance.\\" 3.5/5    8. Peacekeeper: Lindsey. Another one of the greater songs on the album. Its guitar is so reminiscent of earlier Fleetwood Mac stuff. And I love Lindsey and Stevie singing it together in perfect harmony. It's so gorgeous. I absolutely can't get enough of this song! \\"When the night is cold and still/ When you though you'd had your fill/ Take all the time you will/ This is not a test, it's not a drill/ Take no prisoners, only kill.\\" 5/5    9. Come: Lindsey. This one starts out with some beautifully enchanting guitar work. It really sounds like something out of this world. The vocals are somewhat mumbled and they go between speakers, which is confusing, but I'm taking it as that's how it was meant to be. Then the chorus comes and blasts you out of your seat. The vocals in the chorus are so hard to understand and it's all layered and jumbled. But I love Lindsey for it. This song is very fun. \\"Think of me, sweet darling/ Every time you do not come/ Can you feel the fever?\\" 4/5    10. Smile At You: Stevie. This song was written some time before this period, but was never recorded officially until now. The only other versions of this song are demos that Stevie made. Somewhere I read a fan's comment about this song and they said that this album's version of the song was so much more watered down from the original demo. After hearing it, I have to agree. The demos were so much more angry and simple and beautiful. Just piano and electric guitar for the most part. The only thing I like better about this one is Lindsey's guitar work toward the end and his backing vocals. I always love to hear Lindsey and Stevie singing together, so this song at least packs that punch for me. \\"What you did not need was a woman who was stronger/ You needed someone to depend on you/ I could not be her/ I did not want to/ My first mistake was to smile at you.\\" 3/5    11. Running Through the Garden: Stevie. This song is absolutely enchanting. Stevie wrote the lyrics, but not the music. It's classic Stevie, though, and I love her vocals on this song (not to mention Lindsey's back-up). \\"And so you run towards/ What you know is wrong/ There are too many flowers to cut down/ For the love I have for your life/ Turn around.\\" 5/5  12. Silver Girl: Stevie. This is another one of my favorites from this album. It was written by Stevie about Sheryl Crow, who also played guitar and sang back-up on this song. The song is so metallic sounding and very mystical. It's one of those songs where the music truly fit's the words. I feel like I can relate to the song a lot, and I think even though it was written for Sheryl, that it's also very much about Stevie's own life. \\"She was a silver girl/ Lost in a high tech world/ She was a golden girl/ Immersed in a hard-core world.\\" 5/5    13. Steal Your Heart Away: Lindsey. This song was originally going to be recorded for a solo album by Lindsey. That's why something absolutely amazing happens in this song and the next song, which was also to be for that album. Christine McVie, who used to be the third writer in Fleetwood Mac before she left to live her life away from the lime-light, sings background vocals in this song! This may not seem to important to you, but I hate to say that this will probably be the last we hear of Christine in any Mac album. It's refreshing to hear her voice. \\"So come on/ Let's go, let's run away/ If that's all there is/ Oh to steal your heart away.\\" 5/5    14. Bleed To Love Her: Lindsey. This song was also meant to be on the solo album, but ended up being performed by the Mac during their `97 \\"The Dance\\" reunion tour, which was the last time Christine was ever in Fleetwood Mac. Thank goodness they recorded her vocals for this song so that they could be included in this album. \\"Once again she steals away/ Then she reaches out to kiss me/ How she takes my breath away/ Pretending that she don't miss me.\\" 4/5    15. Everybody Finds Out: Stevie. This is another song in which Stevie wrote the lyrics but not the music. I like the music, but I think she could have done a better job herself. The vocals are extremely well done, however. The song seems to be about how Stevie felt when she was having an affair with a married man. We still love you, though, Stevie! \\"When love starts out in the darkness/ It doesn't do well in the light/ Affairs of the heart that start out in the dark/ Usually stay with the night.\\" 3.5/5    16. Destiny Rules: Stevie. The guitar in this song is so beautiful I can hardly stand it! Stevie's voice comes at you like a bus going 100 mph. This is another favorite, it's pure Stevie, plain and simple. \\"When I see you again/ As I always do/ It appears to me that destiny rules.\\" 5/5    17. Say Goodbye: Lindsey. The first time I heard this song was on the Mac's Live in Boston DVD. This is a sweet lullaby of a guitar song, with Stevie and Lindsey singing together. It's one great example of Lindsey's talents and mastery of his music. It's about letting go of Stevie, I believe. \\"Once you said goodbye to me/ Now I say goodbye to you.\\" 4/5    18. Goodbye Baby: Stevie. One of the most sad and beautiful songs I've ever heard. This song makes my heart heart cry every time I hear it. It's also one of Stevie's older songs that never got properly recorded until this album. This version is much better than the piano demo, and it has more lyrics. I think this song is about Stevie's first abortion. But in the context of this album, it's probably about saying goodbye to Lindsey. \\"And I who went to sleep as two/ Woke up as one/ Now only you remain.\\" 5/5    Inconclusion, I love this album dearly. The only gripe I have about it is that it doesn't have any songs written by Christine McVie, who was a pivotal member of Fleetwood Mac and whom I'll dearly miss hearing from. But even that's okay, because it gives more room to focus on Lindsey and Stevie, who hold my heart together when I'm sad or when I'm lonely. Even though they are not romantically involved anymore, I'm glad to know that they are friends now and will forever remain soul mates.     Other albums I'd like to review: Fleetwood Mac, Rumours, Buckingham Nicks, Bella Donna, The Wild Heart. I'm also up for suggestions. Please comment!
B001MYIXAC|4.0|Let The Right One In is one of the best horror films to come out in the past few years. This subtle film centers around an introverted boy who befriends the daughter of his next door nieghbor. Their relationship grows stronger to the point where the girl tells the boy that she is a vampire.     Unlike the Lost Boys, the girl's life is not all fun and games but rather a violent, bloody struggle to survive and stay hidden. The main question in the movie, what makes it really interesting, is the girl vampire actually friends with the boy or is a means to an end? This question gets bounced around throughout the film but is never completely answered. The child actors in this movie are very good which is partly the reason for my 4-star rating. Well worth your time and $$.
0307269191|2.0|I was disappointed with this memoir. The only thing I got from this book was his preternatural gift for running. He doesn't stretch, never gets sick, and has never been injured! I enjoy his novels, and had hoped he would have something insight to say about the transcendence of long distance running. He didn't deliver.   I recommend the New Yorker article over the book, which is totally worth reading.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|\\"Food, Inc.\\" does more than serve as an expos&eacute; on the United States food industry--it connects the dots between the nefarious, contemptuous business practices of multinational corporations and their best friends, the compromised government regulatory agencies such as the USDA, FDA, and EPA, who have in the past been led by folks well connected within the very industries they are supposed to regulate.<br /><br />But let's hold on a minute.  Filmmaker Robert Kenner's documentary could have been just a dour, paranoid investigative piece and still told the truth. Instead, Mr. Kenner has made a colorful, fast-paced, and well-documented account of the state of the food supply in our country; the unintended consequences of the efficiencies, short-cuts, and technological methods inherent in factory farming; the insidious insider relationship between the meat industry and the agencies that should be regulating it; and the health effects, including diabetes, of consuming processed foods and fast foods.<br /><br />Naturally, the culprits behind the curtain (e.g., Smithfield, Monsanto, Perdue) would not appear on camera, not because they are cowards but precisely because they are so powerfully connected, and have legions of lawyers and enforcers (yes, like any bully, these outfits do use intimidation), and are moving to control free speech and criticism of their practices.<br /><br />The counterbalance to the doom and gloom comes from interview with small farmers; with entrepreneurs in the organic food business; with the brave folks who have tried to make a stand against the food industry; and with those experts who are striving to be modern day Paul Reveres in the face of mass indifference.<br /><br />Kenner uses photography and imagery to make his points, and he interlaces this film with scenes of amazing beauty and graphic cruelty. \\"Food, Inc.\\" is not an easy film to watch, and it should not be. Kenner uses the final frames to deliver some to-do's for those who want to respond to the film not just in conversation but through action.

1416972242|5.0|I really enjoyed the entire series by Cassandra Clare.  I am a big Twilight and Harry Potter fan, and this series gave me another world to live in. I fell in love with Clary and Jace and only wish that there could be more. I would love to see this series on the big screen. The opportunities for CGI and characters would be awesome!
B001GCUNYO|3.0|I'm going to start off by saying that I really enjoy this movie and all of the great reviews are well deserved. The reason I've gone down the middle of the road with my rating is because of the poor transfer. When I buy Blu-ray I tend to expect a great picture. Taken has a little too much grain through most of the movie with the worst scenes being low-light situations (especially right after the construction site scene: at this point it looks like the movie was projected onto a rough tweed backdrop). If the filmmakers did this for effect it was a bad move because it takes me right out of the movie and gets me thinking about stupid things like transfers... Again, I liked this movie enough to buy the Blu-ray  after I had already seen it, I just don't feel like I got what I paid for.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|I'm glad Mastodon was able to follow up the incredible Blood Mountain with something as fantastic as this.  I look forward to experiencing whatever their next endeavor has to offer.
B000IOM1RI|4.0|This movie is pretty much a history of how Tenacious D came to be.  It is full of great one liners and a couple of great cameos.  The dynamic between Jack Black and Kyle Gass is great.  It is recommended for anyone who is a fan of The D and also should be seen by anyone who is unfamiliar with the group but enjoys other 2 man novelty acts such as Flight of the Conchords.
0143058525|4.0|This book had a very interesting point of view.  I found it to contain some good ideas for looking for a new spiritual experience.   It had some fun, light moments, too, as well as some neat travel information.  However, it isn't for everyone, just the open-minded.
0385341008|5.0|This is a lovely book.  For those who liked \\"84 Charing Cross,\\" this is one you'll also enjoy. Though the ending won't be a surprise, the journey to it is well worth it. The time is 1946.  Julie Ashton, after 4 years of uplifting columns written during the war, is now ready for a different style of writing.  She receives a letter written by a gentleman from Guernsey.  He has a secondhand book that had her name in it.  He was wondering where he could find similar books.  That begins an exchange of letters, not only from him, but others who were members of the literary society. You are drawn into the lives of the people of Guernsey, both during the war and the present. They become your friends and you wish it would continue forever.  I read this in one sitting as did my friend.  So be certain to find a quiet, comfortable place where you too, won't move until the last page is turned. Enjoy!!!
B001TH16DI|3.0|Wonderful movies first off. Now that I have watched them all, my one gripe is that much of the restoration in many scenes is centered on the character in focus and sometimes a small area around them, but the remaining area is even worse than a standard dvd. For example you look at the face of Kirk when Spock comes aboard and first appears on the bridge in the first movie and it is clear as is a section to the right of some guy standing in the back, but the rest of the frame is totally blurred, so bad in fact that it is distracting. Otherwise, the restored areas are fantastic and the movies speak for themeselves.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|Heyy! It's me again. I haven't reviewed all day. This is my first time reviewing a P!nk album, so here it is.    So What- This is a catchy song. It always gets stuck in my head. Half of the kids in my class hum it while they work. It's danceable if your a frikin' rocker!!! 10/10    Sober- My friend Amanda loves this one. Me, Connor, Chrissy, and her were talking about P!nk. Everybody was voting for \\"So What\\" and then she's like \\"I vote for Sober.\\". So do I! 10/10    I Don't Believe You- Probably my second favorite on the album. In concerts, Pink ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS forgets the words to this song. Not a single, but it deserves to be. 10/10    One Foot Wrong- This song is so-so because I can't tell the beat, it has the weirdest time signature. I don't like it so much. 4/10    Please Don't Leave Me- Okay, the first time I heard this song, I hated it and wondered why it was a single. But the more you listen to it, the more you grow on it, so, don't listen to this once and hate it, keep listening and then you'll be playing this one over and over. 7/10    Bad Influence- This is my third favorite. It's about her boozing it up! Yeah, baby, yeahhhh!!! I was playing this REALLY loud and I looked in the other room where one of my family members were, and even they were rocking. 10/10    Funhouse- No wonder this CD was named after this song!? It totally rocks!!! Not my favorite, but really close! It's like my 2.5th. The only bad part is, near the very end she says \\"...burn this f***** down!\\". 10/10    Crystal Ball- The thing that I like about this song is that it's not mixed, it was recorded in one take, and is aue-natural. 8/10    Mean- I don't like this one. It says the f word. Worse than \\"One Foot Wrong\\"! 2/10    It's All Your Fault- Rocking. The past 2 songs are really slow and it's a shocker when this comes on and wakes you up, maybe gets you in a car crash. 6/10    Ave Mary A- I like this one. That's all I can say. 8/10    Glitter In The Air- THIS IS MY FAVORITE ONE!!!! It's a really cool ballad. Nic voice, nice music. I do't know why it's not the first single off the album. This song to me, is the highlight of the album. Rock on P!nk! 12/10    Out of all 10/10

B000P0J0AQ|1.0|The Matrix is a run of the mill summer movie that for some strange reason gained a cult following. I swear, I really didn't hate The Matrix at the beginning. It was a summer movie, entertaining for the duration of the show, forgettable afterwards.    Keanu Reeves is well suited to play stiff, blank-faced humanoid type characters in science fiction movies... well, because he can just be himself, and all that effort of acting is not getting in his way. So he wasn't the problem. I have enjoyed watching Hugo Weaving in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Proof, so that was a definate plus. The special effects were a bit too self-satified and flashy, but who cares, give the masses eye-candy.    No, what put me off was the mass hysteria that followed. Have you ever seen pictures of screaming teenage girls at a Beatles concert? It was like that, but with grown men. There was a guy, whom I previously considered reasonable, explaining to me how this movie just blew his mind, how incredibly original and philosophically deep it was. I was looking at him wondering what on earth he was talking about. The philosophy of this movie has the depth of a kiddie pool. Everything in it is covered in your average Philosophy 101 class - you know, the one that the graduate students teach, because the professor has better things to do. The plot, once you brush off the SFX glitter is nothing Hollywood haven't regurgitated million times before. As matter of fact, it is the standard Reluctant Hero plot: shy young boy/man is told that he is special, The One. He at first rejects the idea, but of course eventually gives in and ends up saving the day/world/Princess Leia/etc.    The endless gushings about The Matrix finally made me just really hate the movie, and boycotting all the follow-ups. I'm still stupefied by all the hubbub.
0738702994|5.0|I originally bought the Celtic Dragon Tarot but found I wasn't happy with the pastel colors or the descriptions given of the cards. I bought this one and was immediately struck by the vibrant colors, the symbolism in each card, and the story behind each one. This one definitely resonates with me, and it's a keeper!
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|\\"Star Trek\\" is not perfect, but its few fumbles are easy to forgive. This movie managed to do the impossible: It created a whole new generation of fans without alienating the majority of the old ones.     What makes this movie work is that it preserves the essence of Star Trek, but discards all the hokey, cheesy, over the top parts of the original. What have propelled all the ST iteration was the dynamics of the principal characters, as they face various dangers and challenges. In a ways it is a brothers in arms in space story. Sticking to that make this movie work. The whole cast does an excellent job channelling the spirit of the original characters without turning into cartoony copies of them. Especially successful is Chis Pine who channels Kirk's persona without all the mannerism and hamminess of Shatner. He even manages to infuse Kirk's trademark swagger with a bit of boyish charm. Zachary Quinto is an amazingly good match as young Spock. He not only looks strikingly similar to Nemoy, but is very believable as a younger version of the vulcan.    A lot of the credit goes to the writers. What they did with the time line allowed the freedom to focus on the essence of the franchise without having to tiptoe around the established canon at every turn. It was a stroke of genius, but the real achievement is that they managed create a solid script, introducing all the principal characters, give them all a chance the distinguish themselves, and even have a suspenseful plot - and all that before the viewer's bladder would explode.     The high production values also pay off. The special effects do exactly what they are supposed to do: make the action believable without drawing undue attention to themselves. The red alien beast on the ice planet is maybe just a touch too much, but its appearance is brief.    Another thing I really enjoyed about this movie is that it is basically optimistic, uplifting. I'm sick to death of all the grimy, bleak stories that get you more depressed coming out of the theater than going in. Sometimes you just want a well written, fun, suspenseful escapist movie.
B001FB4W16|4.0|2008 was an interesting year for vampire stories.  Three wildly divergent takes on the vampire mythos came out in that year and, coincidentally, all three touched on love in some capacity.  Twilight with its tween-take on a vampire love story on one (to me, abysmal) end, the brilliant Let the Right One In with its mature look at love, isolation and vampires on the other.  Somewhere in the middle lies True Blood, an unapologetic romance, wrapped in a murder mystery and sprinkled with socio-commentary.      Based on the Sookie Stackhouse novels by Charlaine Harris, True Blood's first season was a delightful mix of fantasy, blood and sex that stayed true to the overall story Harris wrote, but added in some usually much needed depth.  Sookie works as a waitress in a bar and has the curse/gift of being able to read minds.  One day, a vampire named Bill enters Merlotte's, the bar, and Sookie finds herself attracted to him as he does to her.  At the same time, someone is killing women in Sookie's town and as the clues start pointing to Sookie's man whore of a brother Jason, she starts to investigate.      The biggest difference between the show and the book lies in Alan Ball's (Six Feet Under, American Beauty) take on the subject.  Because the narrative in the book is first person, there's a lot of side stories and information surrounding the other characters that's never brought up.  True Blood attempts to flesh out the other characters, provide them with their own subplots and give them all more screen time.      For the most part this works well, though there are some sub stories that felt boring and uninspired.  I got so tired of the mid season possession/not possession story involving Tara that I just wanted the season to progress.  At times, it felt as if the meat of the story wasn't enough to fill an entire season, leaving the writers to try to prolong some twists and plot points by adding padding.  And some of the padding feels more important by the end of the season (like Tara's aforementioned problems) when there is a payoff.  But during the season, I continually thought \\"okay, where are we going with this?\\" while looking at the clock.      Even through the sometimes annoying moments, what kept me watching week after week were the characters and the actors that played them.  Whether it's Anna Paquin's strong take on Sookie or Rutina Wesley's pitch perfect Tara or Ryan Kwanten's hilarious Jason, the actors make the characters their own and they are always interesting to watch, even when the plot drags mid season.    Ultimately, Alan Ball and his team of writers pulled it off and True Blood made me excited for the second season (starting June 14th).  It's a fun and funny, gory and sexy vampire story that was made better by the characters and actors.  I personally can't wait for season two to begin and I think Alan Ball has a hit here.      Oh and in True Blood?  The vampires don't sparkle.
045122499X|2.0|I was a big fan of Pillars of the Earth and simply loved the book - I got the sequel about a year later......so it might have been just too much of a time lapse between reading books.  I honestly couldn't get to page 100 with this book.  There just were too many characters to keep track of, things that happened were just too unbelievable.  (the killings in the forest, the burying of the letter and then Thomas becoming a monk and still being in contact with Merthin - it just didn't seem beleivable)  I stopped and put the book down right when Merthin had sex with Wulfur's stepdaughter  (I think thats who it was)........I wasn't into it enough to invest over 1000 pages of my time......plus early English subjects just don't do it for me.....I'm EXTREMELY suprised I liked Pillars of the Earth so much - I'm disappointed that this book just didn't seem to have a plot like Pillars did right off the bat - Pillars kept you interested.....this one did not.
B00138KBQ6|1.0|What a shame.<br /><br />Of course I already owned vinyl, cassette, and CD versions of this album. I've been an Ozzy fan since the 80's and this was one of the few albums I used to listen to (and practice drums to) over and over again in my teenage years, so I know it well.<br /><br />My wife recently (and unknowingly) bought the \\"reissue\\" to play in her car (yes, we're good consumers like that) and I didn't immediately notice the different drums (Mike Bordin does a pretty good job of duplicating Lee Kerlsake's performance), but the bass guitar didn't sound right. And by the end of the first song I knew something was really wrong. It all sounded \\"off\\", like the drums were recorded after everything else (because they were). I thought it could possibly be just because of a re-mix. But then I noticed that one of Lee's harmless drumming mistakes in \\"Crazy Train\\" (going into the verse after the guitar solo) was magically fixed in this recording! And the feel of the slower songs (\\"Goodbye to Romance\\" and \\"Revelation\\") were not at all like I was used to hearing (and playing to) - and everything just sounded... after all these years... so sloppy! \\"Revelation (Mother Earth)\\" is especially bad (rhythm-wise).<br /><br />After researching the unimaginable story of this \\"re-issue\\", it all made sense. The original studio performances were not recorded to a click track and Mike had problems precisely duplicating the original tempo fluctuations. And how you can blame him?<br /><br />When recording modern music, the drums are normally recorded first (before or simultaneously with the bass/rhythm guitars) and then everything else layered on top. This is done for a very good reason: the other musicians listen to and que off the drums for the feel and tempo as they're recording their additional tracks. If you do it backwards, you end up with something horribly sloppy. Especially when you don't use a click trick (as was obviously done with this album). You can't go back in time and fix the human tempo changes without re-recording *all* the tracks/instruments. And Randy Rhoads wasn't available to do that.<br /><br />I can't believe that Mike and Robert would agree to participate in this abomination of rock history! You can't fool the fans.<br /><br />I once auditioned for Ozzy Osbourne (back in the 90's) and I must say... I'm really glad I wasn't the drummer asked to contribute to this travesty.<br /><br />Lee and Bob were instrumental in the creation and success of these songs and it's just unimaginably wrong what Ozzy has attempted to pull off with this sham. So, obviously, I have problems with this album from a moral standpoint as well as a sonic one. Cutting the other musicians out of the photos and attempting (and failing) to replace their performances is just unforgiveable.<br /><br />Shame on you Ozzy!re-recording *all* the tracks/instruments.

B0007OCG4W|5.0|When asked what my favororite movie of all time is, I always name this movie. I then explain it is a drama, at which point my male friends stop listening, because they assume \\"drama\\" means \\"romance.\\"<br /><br />While I would possibly call Closer a love story, I doubt you'll ever manage to find a less ROMANTIC love story.<br /><br />Cheating, lies and secrets are the heart of this story, but as the lives of the main characters are followed I am captivated every second.<br /><br />My favorite character was Natalie Portman's Alice. I love her. She is an extremely interesting character.<br /><br />Actually, they're all pretty interesting. Or perhaps what is interesting is the way the characters are woven together.<br /><br />Whatever they did when they made Closer, they did it right.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a light, fun romance, don't put this DVD in.<br />If you're in the mood for a more dramatic but honest take on the games \\"love\\" plays on us, definitely watch Closer!
B001XJEKGC|4.0|First thing first, this is a fantastic dvd that is a must have for any musician -especially a guitar player.  I saw one review that complained about too many guitar solos???  For me, that is the highlight of this amazing release.  There are some extended jams that shows the true talent of these guys who really invented the jam band.  Eric Clapton played some of the most inspired guitar in his entire career.  It may have been the incredible sound of SW's keys that provided the foundation for the inspired play.   His playing on double trouble definitely made me pick up my strat... Steve Winwood still has an amazing voice along with great chops on the organ, but it was cool to see him jam on his guitar during Dear Mr. Fantasy.  He is a great guitar player and I would have liked to see him play more of it along with EC on this dvd.  BUT, when you have a guitar gun-slinger like Eric Clapton for a sideman, I can see why he let EC handle most of the guitar!  Eric Clapton looked as if he really enjoyed playing during this performance.  I have to think it was playing on songs that were fun to play for him.  The highlights for me were them changes-glad-pearly queen-little wing-voodoo child-can't find-dear mr fantasy.  The only reason I give it a 4 star is that I am not sure you need another version of cocaine - and it added nothing to the show.  And I think there could have been a few more extra songs on the 2nd dvd.  But I have watched this dvd several times and actually enjoy it more than the Cream re-union dvd.  Not sure why, because Cream is one of my favorite groups of all time.  But that says a lot for this dvd.  The camara gets in tight on EC's guitar playing which is a dream for any guitar players.  And it is not the usual fast cut style that we see too often in concert dvd's.  It is easy to watch and listen to.  I have to get the cd now!
B001C4CI8A|5.0|body of lies is a intrieging movie that shows how life is around the world with the terrorism. And how the U.S tries to catch the terrorist. Leonardo plays a good role as an honest man but having to do the dirty work. This movie looks and sounds great on blueray.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|One of the enduring bands of the eighties. Great music with unusual and appealing guitar riffs. Knopfler has a quiet, intense style that carries a punch at times, while at other times he creates a feeling of desire and longing and a sense of nostalgia for things past, such as in songs like  'Brothers in Arms' and 'Walk of Life'. They withstand the test of time because they deal in eternal verities - loss/betrayal/love/consumerism/war and violence.
B000007WNN|5.0|One of the best albums of the `80's period, `Electric' brought English quartet the Cult into the car stereos of mainstream America.  Produced by Rick Rubin, the mad genius behind Slayer and the Beastie Boys, Ian and Billy left their goth rock behind and made a retro yet fresh metal record with more than a passing nod to AC/DC.  `Electric' contains three of their most memorable songs in classics \\"Love Removal Machine\\", \\"Wild Flower\\" (\\"Rock n' Roll Singer\\" by another name) and \\"Lil' Devil\\" and all rocked proudly, more than anything the band had hinted at in their previous incarnations. The video for \\"Machine\\" was the epitome of rock star glory! \\"Peace Dog\\" is a sledgehammer. \\"Memphis Hip Shake\\" is mad bad and tremendously evil and delicious. \\"Aphrodisiac Jacket\\" has some of the dumbest lyrics ever but the song kicks so much ass and Ian sings like he believes every word so who cares! \\"Bad Fun\\", \\"Outlaw\\" and man even \\"Born to Be Wild\\" (which most people seem to hate) all add to the onslaught (Am I the only one who likes it better than the original?).  `Love' may have signaled a changing of the guard but it was `Electric' that will stand as the Cult's finest contribution to rock music. Star of my dreams, most beautiful thing...I love you every hour...look out here she comes!
0446579939|5.0|I have read and collected all of Nicholas Sparks' books.  His writing style keeps me turning the pages as fast as I can, and the stories are beautiful.
0316017922|1.0|After all the hype surrounding this book, I must admit the bar was raised. But the thinness of the book should have tipped me off before I spent money on this book. It's not terrible, some of the points are interesting, but he does nothing to flesh it out - they just left me feeling quite skeptical and cheapened as each chapter dragged on. I lost interest in the middle because it started feeling formulaic (and it's a poor formula, mind). Come up with some pop theory, follow with some mindless drivel, some really basic graphs (to fool the undiscerning eye that this book actually has some weight to it) and end chapter. His 'arguments' sound like what people come up with over dinner conversations after a few drinks.     Overall, pretty disappointing. I took another star off because I actually paid money for this book.
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|The dust has settled from the earth-shattering finale and the consensus among LOST fans is this was the best season yet.  LOST is already known for giving viewers one of the greatest cliffhangers in television history, but this season's was easily the best.  No one has a clue what the final season will be about after the finale... not a clue.  That's how mind-bending this season has been.  It's the best tv on tv!.. go watch it from start to finish and prepare to be blown away by Season 5.
B000002KET|4.0|I'll just come out and say it, I think the synths were not needed in this album. In my opinion, the songs that didn't have synths are the standout tracks on the album and I feel the songs that had synths would have been perfectly fine on their own without synth. And it's not because I don't like the space/psychadelic stuff... \\"Planet Caravan\\" is one of my fave Sabbath songs of all time. Ah well, no need to show the negatives, this album is still really good with only a song, song and a half I don't care for.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|If you liked The Thirteenth Tale, I think you will really enjoy this book. Both stories tell parallel stories - with one taking place in current day and the other taking place in the past. Both stories take place in the UK in an English society manor house. And, there is a slightly spooky mystery at the center of both stories. I thought this was suspenseful and satisfying.
B000002KDO|5.0|Or maybe not. Why not? Well, despite this band being affiliated by others with all things Satanic and dark, this album is a big love-fest and god-love. Sometimes it borders on being \\"preachy\\" even, but the lyrics are written well and you just can't beat the music contained here.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I have to say that I LOVE the book series and have read all of the ones written so far.  I cannot believe how awful the HBO series based on the books is.  I was so excited about the TV series based on the books but, I am sad to say I was so disappointed.  They took a great book series and turned it into a smutty, foul-mouthed TV show.  They have characters in the show that I do not even recall being in the books.  I usually never write reviews for things but, I felt I just had to leave one on this series.  The books are so good and I cannot believe that Charlaine Harris would want her books portrayed in this manner. I guess she is not bothered by it.  I wish that I could get my money back on the DVD's.  I will continue to read her books because she is such a good author but, I will just use my imagination and not watch the series.  My imagination is better.
B000002KE2|5.0|Here I am sitting here nearly 40 years after the release of this album and I'm trying to figure out why this doesn't really sound dated at all. It's still fresh sounding. Anyway, this album is damn near perfect just like the 3 albums prior to it. One thing that appears on this album is Ozzy's \\"true\\" voice. I don't know, for some reason, his voice is a bit deeper, a bit more pronounced starting with this album, and it's this style that most people know him by. It's not too far off of his first two solo albums, actually. Anyway, quit reading this and pick it up for yourself!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|the product shipped in a timely manner. The DVD series is great. It is the same quality you can get in the store only cheaper.
B000002KIK|4.0|This is an awesome album. Sure, it's nothing like the first 4 albums, but it's on par with \\"Sabbath, Bloddy Sabbath\\". In fact, I think I like it better than \\"SBS\\" because Don Airey's keyboards are way better than the synths used on \\"SBS\\". The title track off this album is awesome.
B00008EY7H|2.0|I have 9 DVD's by Cirque Du Soleil, and this is one of my least favorites. The Aerial High Bar (#15) and The Russian Bars (#12) were all I enjoyed, and they were fantastic.  The Fire-Knife Dance (#4) was exciting, but it was too long. The rest were boring, redundant and annoying.  I am glad that I found a good used copy and didn't pay full price for this.  I do wish they would release on DVD the shows playing in Las Vegas, they are awesome.

B001TH16DI|5.0|This is a review from someone who actually owns this set. I've watched all 6 movies and the bonus disc. I think these movies look GREAT on Blu ray. A HUGE step up from the dvd set that I also own. The motion picture has never looked so good. This is the oldest of the films and I am very impressed with how good it looks. They all look great.<br /><br />As far as too much DNR and people looking waxy. Well, they have a ton of make up caked on there faces. These are not the youngest of actors in these movies. People need to know the differance. I still see facial detail, clothing, etc.<br /><br />Also, people commented on things being out of focus, not sharp. I think the cameras used have a very short focus length. So if someone is not the focus of a scene, they are not in focus. This has nothing to do with the restoration, it was how it was filmed originally.<br /><br />Over all I am VERY happy with this set and it is a GREAT deal! Well worth the money.

B00005N5S5|5.0|B-film from the eighties that not only held up well due to an excellently realized production by cast and crew, It became a cultural hit!  Couldn't believe that I didn't have it in my collection, and as it was out of print, Amazon saved the day!<br /><br />The deleted scenes with commentary by James Cameron was a new and valuable insite into the process, as well as to some of the story points that ended up on the cutting room floor, but later formed the basis for T2.<br /><br />Great stuff, can not recommend it enough!
B001FBSMF8|4.0|Wow! Talk about a change in style! Chris' new CD is a complete departure from his past works. If you're expected more Audioslave/Soundgargen type rock -be prepared. After hearing the first minute of this disc, I thought the wrong album had been put in the case. It starts with some strange circus like music, and some speaking that can not be understood, then launches full blown into the most funky, dance-able beat you've ever heard. When Chris starts to sing, it's just icing on the cake. Wow, is this different! I consider myself to be open minded about how certain music \\"Should\\" sound. A LOT of people will not like this new direction. I love it. The CD is produced, or you could say,over-produced to be one long track. It's party time. Without Chris' singing, this would just another disposable record, from another disposable artist. But this is ground breaking music from a rock musician, with great vocal and writing talent. Buy this CD, if you don't like it, your kids or most likely will.

The U.S. tends to the want to skim over the surface in terms of real carnal knowledge of couples in love affairs.

The DVD was pretty entertaining as well, showing interesting bits of when she was creating the music and getting it recorded.    I am glad I threw down the money for this.  There's only one song that I don't like a lot, but the rest of the CD is great.
0240810961|4.0|This is a great book for the budding artist or animator, presenting master classes as taught to Disney animators in the 70's & 80's. The classes go into great detail on facial expressions, hands, walking, etc. This book contains some vintage images of classic Disney production animation art, which is why it interested me, but not enough to recommend to the average Disney or animation fan- this book is geared primarily to the artist.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was the last book of the saga.  I enjoyed the whole series but wanted the last book to leave me with more at the end.  It seemed like we could have had another chapter to summarize the Cullen family after the confrontation with the Volturi.  Maybe, Stephanie left it that way intentionally (hopefully, she will continue with the Cullen story)!  What a terrific series!  I would even read all 4 books again!!  Looking forward to all of the movies!

0307269752|5.0|The first seventy five pages or so I was wondering why I was reading about a journalist being sued for libel, and how this constituted a thriller, but then the plot took off like a shot, and I found myself buried in what of the more intricately plotted suspense novels I've read in some time. The mystery begins when an aging millionaire asks said journalist to help him uncover the mysterious disappearance of his niece some thirty years ago who he believes might have been murdered by someone in his twisted family tree. What unfolds is horrific, chilling, and apt to keep you up at night to turn one more page.
0061478784|5.0|I actually did the unthinkable and wound up watching the movie before reading the book...fortunately though, it didn't taint my expectations. This is my first Diana Wynne Jones book, and I hope that her other works are equally as magnificent because I can't wait to move on to the next one!    In a sense, I'm kind of glad I did things in reverse order because there are little things here and there that are not even mentioned in the Disney adaptation. I like to call them easter eggs; like wonderful little treats that you run into that you're not expecting.    Brilliant. ^__^
006117758X|4.0|Bukowski comes clean on some things in this book, perhaps because, dropping back to childhood years, he couldn't help himself. Some things must have just bubbled up despite his outsider persona (more on this below). In this one we not only learn about his awful father and miserable upbringing, but about some of his early influences, as well as some writers and writing styles he recoiled from. He's more human in Ham on Rye.    Bukowski hates pretense. It's what makes him fascinating, and laudable. He hates it with the passion of a Celine, another misanthrope who knew how to write. And yet in this book, with its smattering of vulnerable details, we get a hint that in other books, tough guy Henry Chinaski, Bukowski's alter ego, is not an entirely pretense-free construct. Which is too bad, because the scant criticism Bukowski gets (he has mostly fans, few detractors)--that there's no uplift in his writing, no redemption--probably derives from this missing slice of his life.    And of course it should be said that Bukowski can be nasty. His takedown of Henry Miller in another book, for instance--whom he presents as an old man, living in Pacific Palisades, supposedly trying to cadge money from his younger visitor (a transparent aka)--gave me the creeps. Why savage your precursor?    Back to Ham on Rye: somewhere along the way I realized I was reading this novel/memoir as if it were a noir mystery--a Jim Thompson, say--which is a genre I like, but whose limitations I understand. And I realized too that I'd lowered my expectations, to accept Bukowski for what he is: a very good writer, but not a great one.[[ASIN:1425702937 I Think, Therefore Who Am I?]]
0240810961|4.0|I enjoyed reading and flipping through this book and watching some familiar characters come to life. I even learned a thing or too about drawing \\"cartoon\\" characters.The biggest flaw of this book though is the fact that when you see the Disney name you expect a book to be filled with lots of Disney characters you know and love, when in fact those characters are few and far between in this book. It's only a flaw though because I had an image in my head of what I wanted the book to be and it is no fault of the author.
B000001EG6|5.0|Elton's recordings prior to this, especially the Empty sky album, are interesting, but this is the album that catapulted him into the big time, where he has remained ever since. The tracks for this album are dated January 1970, but only ten of them appeared on the original album. Other tracks were released as singles. This re-mastered edition includes four bonus tracks taken from the original sessions.<br /><br />The first single, Border song, made the American charts but became a bigger hit for Aretha Franklin, who thus became the first singer as far as I know to have a hit with a cover of an Elton John song. Elton's own follow-up to Border song was a UK-only single coupling two tracks (Rock and roll Madonna, Grey seal) that were omitted from the original album, but which are included here. Elton later re-recorded Grey seal for his classic album Goodbye yellow brick road, but the version here is his rarer first recording of the song.<br /><br />The next single was Your song, released in America following impressive live performances there. The B-side of that single, Take me to the pilot, features lyrics that even their writer Bernie Taupin admits are meaningless. He sometimes does that sort of thing but points out that the words sound good together and that's what matters. Yet Bernie was also capable of writing meaningful lyrics of a high quality, and his best songs all share that chat eristic. While the best example here is Your song, others include The greatest discovery (about the birth of a baby), Sixty years on (reflecting on what the future might offer; about forty of those sixty have so far elapsed) and First episode at Hienton (inspired by a time in Bernie's youth).<br /><br />This was a great album, but even greater albums were to follow in the ensuing years.

While I have a problem with the notion of an Army unit being made up solely (or nearly solely) of officers...eh, and properly functioning, I like Jack Reacher's people none-the-less. A pity a few more of them couldn't have been enlisted men or women because the Army likes to say that Sergeants are the backbone of the Army. We former Sergeants like to believe that occasionally some of the officers were a little further down. In the real world it's the enlisted folk that make the Infantry work, that load and fire canons for the Artillery, that make helicopters and airplanes fly, that make better coffee in the morning, better snide remarks during the long work day, and well, you get the picture. Also, there is no 81st Airborne...82nd sure, 101st okay but no 81st...small nits, little pick.<br />  The fact is Lee Child has a good character with Jack Reacher and a good character for the times and come on, folks...who doesn't like to see the good guys win in a manner that befits the crime. Add a Lee Child novel to your reading list. The books, this one included, are well done thrillers and whodunnits.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have not written a review yet, but I feel moved to do so for this series. Firefly is easily the best TV series that I have watched. A classic from joss Whedon with a great storyline and fantastic acting.  It is such a pity that it was cancelled so early on.
B000TGCR38|4.0|This is a very good film.  The solitary reason I held back from giving it five stars is due to the liberties taken with the occupation history in order to fit the story into a time frame of September 1944 to May 1945. BLACK BOOK cannot be categorized as a war film.  It is a drama thriller, complete with a mystery that is only resolved at the conclusion of the film, set during the final year of World War Two in Europe.<br /><br />The film's main character is Rachel Stein, who later goes by the name of Ellis de Vries. The movie begins with Rachel in Israel eleven years after the European war. After meeting one of her wartime friends, the setting moves back to wartime Holland.  It is late 1944 and Rachel and her family have thus far succeeded in hiding from the Nazis.  As the Allied advance has stalled after September's Operation Market Garden, Rachel, her family, and dozens of others attempt to reach liberated Holland via a lumbering barge zigzagging through the marshes.  Unfortunately they are betrayed and intercepted by a German patrol boat.  As the sole survivor of the incident, Rachel makes her way to the Hague, changes her name and goes under cover for the resistance.  She is motivated in part by the fact that she recognizes an officer at SS headquarters as one of the Germans who took part in the massacre and looting of the refugees who attempted to escape through the marshes.<br /><br />At the SS headquarters she becomes romantically involved with a Sicherheitdienst officer Ludwig Muntze.  Muntze realizes quickly that Rachel is not what she appears to be, but is smitten with her and does not take any action.  For his part Muntze also realizes the the war is ending badly for Germany and secretly negotiates a cease fire with the resistance.  Muntze attempts to assist Rachel by exposing SS officer Franken as an embezzler of looted jewels, money, and other valuables.  The attempt backfires and Muntze's superior, Kautner, imprisons Muntze.<br /><br />The resistance attempts to free some of their own from the basement of the headquarters, but are ambushed by alerted German SS troops.  It becomes obvious that there is an additional traitor in the reistance.  Rachel, now imprisoned by the SS, is framed as the traitor. She and Muntze subsequently escape from the prison, wait out the end of the war, and attempt to clear their names before they are captured by the Dutch and the mystery as to the real traitor continues to unfold.<br /><br />The above summary barely does justice to the film as there are additional twists and turns, but you will have to watch the movie to find out what happens.<br /><br />Unlike director Paul Verhoeven's earlier work SOLDIER OF ORANGE, BLACK BOOK is not a true story -- though it is billed as based on true events.  This is where the film departs from some historical accuracy.  In the beginning of the film we find Rachel living in circumstances similar to that of Ann Frank -- living in a secret annex of a farm house. Later she joins other refugees attempting to cross the rivers and marshes of the Biesbosch.  In 1944 - 1945 the Biesbosch served as a regular route for couriers, refugees, and Airborne escapees.  The film then jumps from September to several months later, which would put the film in February 1945, though it does not look like February.  At that point in history the Dutch in occupied Holland suffered greatly in the what became known as the Hunger Winter.  With the exception of the soup kitchen where Rachel is employed, the Hunger Winter is not portrayed in this film.  Likewise in BLACK BOOK the Dutch rail service appears to be uninterrupted at this stage of the war.  The final deviation from history is that the Germans at the SS headquarters celebrate Hitler's birthday in a fashion that would have been more likely in 1942 and not at at time when the Soviets had already surrounded Berlin and V-2 rockets were no longer being fired from the Hague.<br /><br />Those points aside, the movie returnsto the historical period with the euphoria surrounding the liberation and use of German military personnel for labor and administrative duties in the months following the German surrender.<br /><br />There are some very familiar faces in this movie.  In fact, four of the stars would also appear in 2008's VALKYRIE.  Actor Christian Berkel makes yet another appearance as shaved-headed German officer.  We have seen him in other war time setting movies such as DOWNFALL, VALKYRIE, and MIRACLE AT ST, ANNA.<br /><br />In the end, BLACK BOOK has elements of war, Holocaust, love story, and  detective thriller.  Yes, as a European film there are some risque scenes included that lend very little to the story, but you expect this sort of thing from a movie lensed in the Netherlands.to the historical period with the euphoria surrounding the liberation and use of German military personnel for labor and administrative duties in the months following the German surrender.<br /><br />There are some very familiar faces in this movie.

B000002UTY|5.0|May, 2009: It just occurred to me that I first heard \\"Happy Trails\\" 40 years ago, almost to the day.      I have owned more copies of Happy Trails than any other album, and that's saying something. I first heard it in the summer of 1969 at a party, and it seemed like the \\"Who Do You Love?\\" side of the album was about five hours long. Maybe that's because everyone had ingested mushrooms and nobody was in any condition to turn the LP over. I was home for the summer from college, where I'd left a cheap turntable, etc. My dad had an 8-track player in the house to listen to his stuff on, and I bought an 8-track tape of Happy Trails.     Then I bought an LP copy for my senior year of college and beyond. Flash forward to the mid-1980s, when I was seriously into analog vinyl playback and found used record stores in every city I visited. I picked up two more regular copies (one sealed) and a heavy, double-weight Capitol copy. In those days, when surely my hearing was better than now, I was very interested in \\"sonic quality\\" (still am) and Happy Trails was one of my favorites to play for visitors to hear what $12,000 worth of LP playback gear sounded like.     Sadly, I sold my LP collection, more than 2,000 of them, in a personal financial meltdown in 1995, but not before making about 200 good-quality cassette tapes of my favorite LPs to hold me over. It goes without saying that Happy Trails is one of them.     Today, I own only a few dozen CDs. I just bought my first CD copy of Happy Trails and must say it sounds great, faithful to the original, even on my cheapo stereo system. At 60, I don't need mushrooms any more but I still need Happy Trails. If I wanted a funeral, which I don't, I'd ask that HT be played. Maybe even the Roy Rogers bit.     JC, New Jersey

I work in a hospital, so the what--health care--is already determined. But, as is shown, we can have an agreed upon goal, but the pathway can vary. Indeed, it must be flexible to succeed. That is why Aristotle ([[ASIN:0486400964 Nicomachean Ethics (Dover Thrift Editions)]]) focused so much on character: laws (or business plans for that matter) can only go so far.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|I just watched this movie from start to finish and I feel that no matter what is said, Brad Pitt gave the best performance of his career. Oh he's good in other roles(The Ocean Trilogy for one), but in this movie, I can see the age progression, the changes between the two lovers, oh it is nothing short of phenomenal. Seriously. When I got to the end of the film, I didn't feel depressed, I didn't feel much. to be honest, I cannot explain it. I sat and watched a movie of two people who were moving in two different directions which made me feel sad for them. When they were at their best, they gave the love they needed to one another. But at the end I felt nothing but some sadness for them, but again I realize that the two were there for each other when they were there for each other. One thing that intrigued me was the buttons at the beginning of the movie with the movie company logo; that was cute. I was ticked with Benjamin's father because he wanted to toss that baby to its death and if it wasn't for that cop asking questions, he would have. I am glad to see that he came to terms with him though and did the right thing. I was a bit ticked that no one would reach him when Queenie passed away. An oversight? what is this? I must say I was quite impressed with the movie; I can see why it got the accolades it did; I am sorry it didn't get the Oscar but in spite of that lack, it's still a very good film. A darn good film.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|Clint Eastwood delivers another powerful story in his latest work \\"Changeling\\".  While some may be attracted to the film because Angelina Jolie has a lead role, I recommend audience to watch the film because of its content.<br /><br />Film is based on the real story about he mother in late 102os Los Angeles whose son disappears.  Duped by police, her plea for search on her son is first ignored, then stalled until eventually she is reunited with  a child that is not her own.  Her determination to pursue the truth annoys local political machine so much that she is put against her will into a psychiatric ward.<br /><br />Eastwood has a true and amazing story to tell but unlike his other films, this one drags just a little bit longer than it should.  Angelina Jolie gives wonderful performance as a mother whose child is missing, but this is not her moment, it is definitely Clint Eastwood's (directing) moment.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Hold on tight, this English mini-series walks a precarious line between being part very funny comedy, part drama, part romance, part fantasy in it's own right versus simply being outright offensive to Austenphiles and their beloved memories and characters.    The plot is fantastic: modern girl, Amanda Price, no apparent relation to Fanny, pines for genteel age of 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Mr. Darcy'.  Somehow, she exchanges places with a very willing, flesh and blood Elizabeth Bennet.  What ensues becomes total chaos and unpredictability as Amanda's wish disrupts all that is sacred in the Austen world, and try as may to fix it- it just gets worse.    How do the new characters compare?  The parents and the sisters are fine giving us more indepth details of who they truly are, Mr. Bennet- reasonable, Mama- unreasonable, a tigress for her family security.  Caroline Bingley(Christina Cole- soon to be in another English TV series-\\"Emma\\".  Can you believe it!) is one of my favorites.  Of course, she's sharp tongue and brilliantly malevolent.  Mr. Collins probably the best Collins yet, more slimy and stupid; Wickham- handsome and really not what he seems; Lady Catherine(Lindsay Duran- remember her as Lady Burtram in 'Mansfield Park'-1999)stalwart as the grand matriarch.  And Darcy?  Elliot Cowan stays true to the misunderstood but noble hero's image. Tough boots to fill. My wife thinks he's great.  Must be.    Finally, the heroine(Jemima Rooper- don't know her- lots of TV work): to like or not to like?  That is the question.  She's no Elizabeth Bennet.  But she definitely says what's in her head whether she wants to or not.   She's awkward and out of place in both worlds, a bit obnoxious and uncouth.  She desperately wants to do the right thing.  Most of the time, she can't help herself let alone anyone else; lovesick and vulnerable, we couldn't help but root for her.          This miniseries is very well shot with all the beautiful trappings of locations and costumes andgood actors.  Three hours long with a very good 40 minute \\"making of\\" segment in the special features.    Tried and true, stick to the story, Austen fans will probably be put off by the changes and the slight offensiveness.  But we laughed immensely. 'Lost in Austen' is it's own creation. Each episode is a surprise.  Where is this story going?  What unbelievable yet still somewhat reasonable actions do the characters intend to pull off?  How will they wrap this all up?    I'd give 4- 4 1/2 stars because I'm not very discerning at times about things of the heart, but this series has lots of heart and believe it or not, romance.  My Elizabeth says to give it 5.  Ok.

B0007P3582|5.0|\\"The Massacre\\" is going on 5 years since it came out. It still gets mad play on my ipod and stereo systems. The production on this album is classic and Fiddys lyrics get deep into thought like \\"Ryder Music\\" and grimy like \\"This Is 50\\" both standout songs. Only a couple of tracks I don't care for but the rest of the album is on point. Best Songs are \\"In My Hood\\" Hard ass beat produced by C. Styles & Bang Out that fif rips into with a hard street story. \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" A laid back beat as I said before production is crazy Fif takes you on a trip to his past with great song writting concepts. \\"Piggy Bank\\" 50 goes hard at his weak adversaries with a cold beat. \\"Get In My Car\\" Produced by Hi-Tek prolific storytelling. \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\" story of a chick addicted to heroin. \\"Ryder Music\\" anyone says fiddy is wack play this joint can't say nothing afterwards that's straight game.<br /><br /> \\"Just A Lil' Bit\\" produced by Scott Storch nice beat 50 shines on this one supprised? \\"Outta Control\\" all concepts of buliding a song just happen to fit perfectly on this track. \\"Sky Mask Way\\" produced by Disco D writting about being a stick up kid. \\"Disco Inferno\\" Fif flows smoothly on the Dre drums effortlessly. \\"My Toy Soldier\\" featuring Tony Yayo which happens to be a great song writter and mcee as well produced by Eminem. \\"Position Of Power\\" produced by Jonathan \\"J.R.\\" Rotem production, beats, piano and lyrics are flawless on this. \\"Bulid You Up\\" featuring Jamie Fox not a bad track for chicks produced by Scott Storch. \\"Gatman And Robin\\" Fiddy towers on this beat along with Eminem enough said. \\"God Gave Me Style\\" produced by Needlz nice track Fif realizes God and his Moms still looking out for the kid. \\"I Don't Need' Em\\" 50 seems like he flows better, has more fire in him when he has a chip on his shoulder.<br /><br />I believe my review helps out a little better than these 1 star 1 line reviews.

B001EAWMGA|4.0|Being a sci-fi/horror fan, I was initially leery of this movie because of past disappointments in the genre. But, the positive reviews swayed me and my hubby and I watched it tonight - it was fun, entertaining, with humor, intelligent writing, and above-average performances by the cast.<br /><br />Compared to the lackluster \\"Pathfinder\\", \\"Outlander\\" may have a rather cheesy premise, but it ultimately delivers [though it too suffers from some plodding scenes]. Jim Caviezel [who played Jesus in The Passion of the Christ] plays alien Kainan who crashes down to Earth, circa 709 A.D. and lands in Norway. Trouble is he is not alone as his spacecraft also harbored a Moorwen, a beast that looks like a hybrid dragon/alien/predator [from those movies] and which can glow with an eerie reddish luminescence. The beast also has a huge appetite - for human flesh.<br /><br />Kainan is taken captive by the Vikings who have a settlement nearby, under the rule of King Rothgar [John Hurt] who has a fiesty daughter Freya [Sophia Myles], and whom he loves dearly. Rothgar's heir apparent is Wulfric [Jack Huston] who plans to wed Freya. Initially, Kainan is regarded with suspicion, taking into consideration the decimation of a neighboring settlement. His tales of hunting down a dragon-like creature is met with disbelief and anger, but it is only later that the villagers discover the truth of his words. Kainan and company band together [later joined by angry rival chieftain Gunnar played by Ron Perlman, in a brief but memorable role] to destroy the moorwen, and the rest of the movie is dedicated to this quest.<br /><br />The premise may seem rather like a B-movie type story, but it actually works here - almost everything is explained during the course of the movie, and credibly played out. The creature effects are not too bad - could have done with more sophisticated effects especially in the flashback sequences to Kainan's past, but on the whole it wasn't disappointing.<br /><br />There are even a couple of twists thrown in that suprised me - having to do with the characterization of the moorwen. Final verdict - this is definitely one of the better sci-fi/horror creature features, and a couple of notches above some of the pathetic drivel shown on the Sci-Fi channel.n in that suprised me - having to do with the characterization of the moorwen.

B0018YIFEK|5.0|Jodi Picoult's My Sister's Keeper is a breathtaking story of life or death.    When Kate was only two years old she was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia, known as APL. After finding this out, Kate's parents, Brian and Sara were very desperate in finding a way to cure their little girl. This is why Anna was born.    \\"On the other hand, I was born for a very specific purpose. I wasn't the result of a cheap bottle of wine or a full moon or the heat of the moment. I was born because a scientist managed to hook up my mother's eggs to my father's sperm to create a specific combination of precise genetic material.\\"    So basically Anna was only born to be a perfect genetic match for her sister Kate so she was able to get donated things she needed faster and it would be less of a risk for Kate to have the donated material fail.    In my opinion, this is one of the best books I have ever read and some very unexpected things occur that you would really surprise you. I also like this book because there is so much detail that you could create a picture in your mind of the situation and you can get a feel for what it is that any of the main characters are feeling and could feel what it would be like if you were in their footsteps.    This book has so many connections to my life. I know someone who has a different rare form of leukemia and I can understand how much that family has to give up for their son and for their brother, and it's so hard for anyone who knows a person with any type of cancer or sickness.
B000UJ48UO|1.0|I bought the Blu-ray version of Full Metal Jacket thinking this would be a true widescreen version, but it's not. The movie is actually a cropped version of the Full Screen version. After comparing the two versions, the Blu-ray version seems cramped and lacks the visual composition of the original Full Screen version.<br /><br />This rating has nothing to do with the quality of the story or the audio, which is excellent.<br /><br />The rating has everything to do with releasing this movie as a Widescreen version of the movie. If you want to see what you are missing, buy the original DVD version instead.
B000JML7YC|4.0|Although not one of Jane Austen's more well-read novels, I found this one enjoyable to read. I thought it was a little darker than some of her other novels.  Formatting needs some help, but what do you expect when the book is free? Otherwise, a good read.
B001TOD92C|5.0|THE WRESTLER    There have been films made before about wrestling and by wrestling I mean pro wrestling, but none like this. This film is the portrait of a man who is coming to terms with his own mortality, literally and also for his craft. There have been many things said about this movie but there seems to be one constant, and that is Mickey Rourke's masterful performance. For those who have not seen this I can tell you right now that he was screwed at the Academy Awards, that little golden man should have been his with out a doubt. I have been a fan of pro wrestling for a long time and while films like \\"Ready to Rumble\\" are fun for those days when you need to shut off your brain there has never been a serious film on it, until now.     The film follows Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson {Rourke} during the end of days so to speak for him, his days doing what he loves are coming to an end. Sure his prime is long behind him but the first part of this showcases that he still loves what he does [on weekends] until health issues arise. Add in the fact that he has an estranged relationship with his daughter { Evan Rachel Wood} and a weird one with a stripper{ Marisa Tomei}. So the film moves on through the emotional ups and downs of a half empty man with an empty life. As his time draws near he tries to mend fences with his daughter and purse a real stable relationship with a stripper named Cassidy. If all that sounds not so appealing to you and you shy away from this film you are making a big mistake. The journey this man takes is really an interesting one, we follow him from knowing who he was to finding out who he is.    Director Darren Aronofsky who has made such classics as The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream, and Pi just to name a few has created another classic masterpiece. I love how he and DP Maryse Alberti brought a some what documentary style to this film, it felt real. Writer Robert Siegel did an excellent job crafting this tale, and should have at least been up for nomination for an Oscar. I am not sure if what I am about to say is true but I'll say it any way, I have heard that this film was based on the wrestling documentary \\"Beyond The Mat\\" [great film]. In fact in particular I have heard it was based on Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts's portion of the film, it fits with the alcohol and drug abuse and really fits the daughter portion.     Like I said earlier Mickey Rourke is masterful in this film and he should have won the Oscar easily, hands down it should have been his. It has been said that Rourke did not portray this character as much as the character portrayed him, he did an excellent job. Same can be said for the two female leads Evan Rachel Wood playing his daughter and Marisa Tomei playing his would be girlfriend stripper. Both of them do wonderful jobs with this film as both play very different but somewhat the same characters. They live very different lives and have different personalities but both act the same around Randy. Both try to stay away from him and avoid a real relationship but both find themselves drawn to him only to be hurt. Also Ernest Miller also known as \\"The Cat\\" a real life pro wrestler did a great job as The Ayatollah as do all the wrestlers in this film from TNA regulars Jay Lethal and Ron Killings [WWE] to ROH athletes like Necro Butcher.     When viewing this film you will find yourself laughing at times and sad for him at the very next moment, this film truly takes you through all the emotions. From the happy beginning to the last triumphant shot of the film you will be cheering for The Ram. Does he make back to the top one final time or is that last shot just one more misguided attempt at past glory, that is up to you. For me this is a winner and one brilliant film and I am glad to see the mainstream accepting wrestling again after the Benoit thing. This is a great look into what life for a pro wrestler who is still trying to be in the game can be like. Like I said this movie is about one man going from knowing who he was to finding out who he is, glad I could take that journey with him.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Content doesn't need mentioning - a fantastic 5 star film.    However, thank goodness for the fact that you can get Region 1 Full Screen versions of most films, unlike region 2 where you are stuck with wide screen! I hate the pillar box effect of 1:2.35 on normal TVs.
0786852550|4.0|The Amulet of Samarkand is a great book because...  it is full of lie, deceit, theft, murder, and more.  The first main character is a young boy named Nathaniel (magician) who is bent on getting revenge on a man who wronged him called Simon Lovelace.  He thought he had a \\"well- conceived\\" plan to publicly humiliate him.  Thus ruining his career forever .   The other main character, Bartimaeus, is a mid-ranking djinni (demons summoned by magicians).  He is summoned by Nathaniel and must obey all of his charges (commands).  He loathes even the thought of being summoned by a meager magician.   The book is written from both of their perspectives.  It switches about every other chapter from a first person view of Bartimaeus (complete with sub text) to a third person view of Nathaniel.  Bartimaeus does not spare any of his emotions or thoughts in his sections of the book.   Whether you're into fantasy, sci-fi, or drama, this is overall an exciting read for just about anyone.  Oh and it's only the first book in the Bartimaeus Trilogy.  Next is The Golem's Eye, followed by Ptolemy's Gate.
031286504X|3.0|I purchased this book because of the movie, thinking it would be similar.  I guess in a way it is, last person alive, vampires trying to get to him.  What I didn't realize was this book was written back in the 50s and it really doesn't have anything to do with the movie with Will Smith.  Now this is a short book, it's pretty good, I like the idea, but I prefer books more closer to my era.  It's very easy reading, a page turner.  If you are looking for a good quick read this is the book for you.  If you are looking for the movie in writing, avoid this book.  I did like the movie much better than this book.

0525951113|5.0|For those of us who surf the Internet, play games online, do our banking online, keep our computers (personal and company) online 24/7, purchase online, this book is for you.  Keep in mind the internet is connected world wide so that what a small computer connected in a small world in a 3rd country can do could effect the whole world!<br /><br />Daniel Suarez shows us just what an intelligent person can do if they suddenly go mad with the internet.  And how even after the person dies what they leave on the internet can effect us all.  Don't worry, I'm not giving away more then the first few pages.<br /><br />Daniel Suarez is not afraid to push the envelope.  People you think will be the hero die, others you think are nothing turn into a major character.  He really leaves good openings and a good ending for part two of this book (which I'm anxiously awaiting).<br /><br />I think those who enjoy books about the internet and how it has the potential to effect will find this book a great read.

0471413909|4.0|[NOTE:  This review relates to the paperback edition.]      At first glance, the Paleo diet seemed extreme to me.  Give up grains AND beans AND dairy completely?  What's left?  Won't I be hungry?  Won't I get bored?  Won't I die of malnutrition? Obviously the answer is \\"no.\\"  My body adjusted quickly to lean meat, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, raw and cooked vegetables, and fruit.  I'm eating 10 times more fruits and vegetables than before, snacking more and cooking more. My food cravings are gone, and I feel sated after I eat. Oh yes, and did I mention that I lost 8 pounds over the past 4 months?    I've seen numerous health benefits from lowering my glycemic index and salt intake and eliminating the indigestible proteins found in grains and beans. Acid reflux, gas, joint pain, sinus congestion -- all completely gone! Amazing.    Since nobody's twisting my arm, I've \\"cheated\\" a few times and eaten something that used to be part of my diet, like oatmeal or corn chips.  Next day the acid reflux, gas and congestion come back. My sense of taste has become more sensitive and I notice a rancid, unpleasant note even in foods like organic oatmeal. So the desire to stray has diminished and staying on the diet is easy. However, there are a couple of things I've chosen not to give up: organic butter as a condiment on vegetables, and organic half-and-half in my coffee. I've noticed no ill effects, and get a lot of taste enjoyment from these items, which is important even when eating healthy!    I've given the book 4 stars rather than 5, because there are a few things here and there that I don't agree with. I don't think one should heat flax seed oil. And the recipes, while passable, don't excite me very much.  Also, the book is written in a popular self-help style, focusing on weight loss and bypassing a purely health-conscious viewpoint. One example: although Dr. Cordain says we really shouldn't drink it, he mentions diet soda as a possible beverage. He knows better.     On the other hand, the health benefits for \\"eating Paleo\\" are offered in an understandable way, explaining why it's good for high blood pressure, osteoporosis, diabetes and so on. If you read the book, you will know how to \\"do the diet\\" and why it's a good idea. The science is well-presented. There's a 20-page index of double-blinded study research results from around the world, to which Dr. Cordain refers throughout the book. This is not some weird dietary notion that somebody invented. It was arrived at by hard research, investigation and study. Whether you accept the theory that we should strive to approximate our caveperson ancestors' diet is beside the point: from my experience, this is a healthy diet that eliminates the pitfalls of eating foods our bodies were not genetically programmed to digest. My results speak for themselves.    Some people do have bodies that can handle just about anything they feel like eating. And ethnic, regional and personal variations ensure that the Paleo diet will never take over the world. All I can say is that eating Paleo has improved the quality of my health immeasurably.  And as a weight loss diet, it's foolproof. Eliminate junk food and fast food and replace them with high quality animal protein and as much fresh veggies, fruits, nuts and seeds as you can pile in your mouth...and thank Mother Nature (and Dr. Cordain et al) for Her bounty with every bite.

Lestat takes over a band and uses his music to summon forth some old lovers and deadly enemies while telling the tale of how he came to be.    Queen of the Damned, the final book, finds Lestat and his immortal companions up against the mother of the vampires, Akasha.

A must have for all vampire fans!
B001TH16DI|5.0|I will admit right out of the blocks that I am a 'newbie' to HD. I waited until the BD / HDDVD war was over and this is my first purchase of BD disks. That said, I read with a LOT of concern reviews posted here by many people who posted reviews prior to release of these; it is odd that reviews are allowed prior to any chance of the reviewer having possession of the item.<br /><br />Anyway, I received the set a couple days ago and thus far have watched large parts of I, II, and IV. I have to say that I find the quality excellent. I was worried about the DNR issue but for me it is not very noticeable; I have carefully watched for loss of information / facial expression and when I have seen that effect it is apparent it is not from DNR but from soft focus either intentional or accidental in the filmmaking process (one can tell that the focal plane for the original film is not set for sharp facial focus but is focused on nearby objects or another face with lighting and camera setup not giving adequate depth-of-field for sharp focus for both). The visual detail is really stunning. It really took me back to seeing TWOK in the theater years ago with a level of detail that was only barely hinted at on my old VHS copy; better hinted at on LaserDisc, quite viewable on DVD, and now is back. (Yes, Paramount has done well by me)<br /><br />I respect the opinions of those who honestly AFTER VIEWING THE MOVIES feel there are issues; but please don't avoid the purchase and enjoyment of this great set (at a great price) just because some folks who have never seen them are critical. I am personally very pleased with the purchase; using the opportunity to introduce ST to my 4 and 6 year old kids.

B001RIY4WE|1.0|Even with the latest firmware update to my 3 month old Pioneer Elite BDP-05FD Blu-ray player, the disc will not play the movie's video - only the audio. This is my second Pioneer Elite blu-ray player, the first one purchased two years ago, so I'm familiar with blu-ray's iphone-like need for constant software upgrades. All my other blu-ray discs play perfectly, and it's all playing on a Runco VX-22d 3-chip 1080p projector, so that's not the problem. I think it's inexcusable that a disc is distributed that won't work on a modern higher-end system, much less a more mainstream system. Sometimes a company can get a little too cute with pushing the envelope on specification reqirements, and I think that's what we have here. A complete waste of time and money.
B0000683DH|5.0|This film beats \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" only because it's a sequel to \\"Space Seed\\", not a remake.

0452289963|5.0|Words are unable to express the ramifications of what Tolle lays out in a plain and simple manner of the phenomena of life, and where as humans, we are a part of it. I am unable to find fault in what is written. I compare Stephen Hawkins' A Brief History in Time book to what is  in this book, and see no contradictions in the phenomena of time, matter, and energy, and where we fit in all this. I am speechless.  I am a new reader of Tolle, and have taken in this guidance of handling  the mental phenomenas that plague we who developed language, or symbols representing real objects, that soon we loss the ability to identify the real to the concepts of the real. It first hit me, he asking to do away with my thinking mind, as like trashing my dear laptop, or calculator, or.......myself.  People live in their heads, they think all kinds of thoughts, often times beyond their will. People think they need their uncontrolled, often negative thoughts because it is them, like an arm or leg. That without these 'guidelines,' or a Jiminy Cricket on their shoulder, they will go off the deep end, or do something foolish.   Recognizing what actually is human suffering, that it is not what we think it is, but is a human-created physical manifestation, gives control to the carrier of the suffering to decide whether or not they want to continue harboring it.  Akin to remoras attached on to sharks, I look at them now realizing they are not me.   Dayle Tamura
B001SF8G1Q|5.0|New Morning is a forgotten treasure which I gladly review here. This remastered version was long overdue since it clearly marks a renaissance in Dylan's career and life.     He'd been roughly 10 years in the public eye and all around things had changed. He'd changed. Nowhere else will we find Dylan so sure of being married, living in the country, trying to raise a family. This is where you get the impression of a happy frozen moment in his life as he wouldn't be this sure a mere three years later with Planet Waves.    Bob was definitely immersed in his life with Sara and most songs serve as a fitting tribute to his marriage and kids. His heartfelt lyrics on Sign On The Window go on like this: \\"Build me a cabin in Utah/marry me a wife/catch rainbow trout/have a bunch of kids who call me 'Pa'/that must be what it's all about/that must be what it's all about\\", he sings enthusiastically.   On Time Passes Slowly, he states: \\"Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town/Ain't no reason to go to the fair/Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down/Ain't no reason to go anywhere\\".   And on New Morning, he opens his heart: \\"So happy just to be alive/Underneath the sky of blue/On this new morning, new morning...with you\\".   If Not For You and The Man In Me are also obvious favourites.       Dylan plays quite a lot of piano on New Morning, seven tracks in total, which also helps to give it quite a distinctive flavour. All adds up to  a set of strong songs, all belonging to each other just like the music on Blood On The Tracks does. It appears he'd found a new way which eventually took him to all the anger, frustration and beauty of his aforementioned 1974 masterpiece. This alone is a reason to dive into these tracks of love - this ode to raising a family fitting as a counterpoint to his infamous broken marriage a few years later.    It also seems he just felt lucky to be alive and well after his years of turbulence in the sixties and that feeling of a new beginning is very much alive on this album. I'd place this as a unique gem in Dylan's career so - if you're curious - grab it with no hesitation.     It is also worthy of mention that Father Of Night even ended up covered by Manfred Mann's Earth Band on Solar Fire in 1973 as a great progressive rock opus!
B001JNNDBA|1.0|Man, I've loved this movie ever since word spread about it being a must-see right after it came out on DVD.  Fox really screwed the pooch on the transfer, it looks like a muddy VHS tape straight from the 80s where this story takes place.  I seriously hope they're not trying for another double dip as it got on DVD, because as much as I love Richard Kelly, I simply will not be taken advantage of again.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I wanted a turntable that would hook directly to my computer so that I could transfer my vinyl collection to CD. I am 59 so I have an extensive collection of '60s and '70s vinyl. I am very happy with this purchase. Connection and operation are very easy. The unit is plastic and it is belt drive so one gets what they pay for. But in the case of this Sony turntable, one does get a unit that exceeds those particulars. I didn't expect too much but I got a little more. One thing to know before buying; when your read the documentation that comes with it you will find that there will be no sound from your computer speakers being that it is connected USB. I bought a small amp (Pyle from Amazon.com) so that I could also hook up to some speakers so now I can transfer to CD and also hear the music.
B00005T5YK|5.0|At $ 111.00 Used,this is the single most expensive item in my collection of 45 years, but...when an album is THIS flawless, without a solitary moment of anything negative, AND you have a great 5.1 setup with DTS...I personally think it's a no-brainer. But that's just my humble opinion.

0312360266|4.0|I read Marked after seeing many bloggers review it, many saying it is the only series out of this new batch of YA vampire books that is worth reading.  I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  I was under the impression that all of the new vamp books were Twilight ripoffs, but this had almost no similarities.  The writing was awkward and not at all fresh, but the plot was pretty awesome.  While I often complain of overexposition in books, I felt like this one just hastily jumped right in, giving almost no exposition at all.  Parts are preachy, others are crude, but it is truly a unique book.  Most vampire novels have the vampires living in complete isolation and secrecy, but in the Casts' world, everyone knows of their existance.  The first book sets up what appears to be shaping up to be a really great story, and I will eagerly seek out the sequels for the plot, not for the writing itself.<br /><br />Rating:<br />I'm going to say 5/5 for plot,<br />3/5 for writing.

B00064ADR0|5.0|Saw Johnny in 72 at the Garden in NYC and man, what a show! Caught him again at the Felt Forum a year later with his brother and Rick Derringer. I own everything by Johnny and this is a classic. When I saw this edition, with a show from the Royal Albert Hall, I was most excited. I traded in my single disc copy and purchased this. The live performance disc is as good as it gets. If this gets your blood move'in (as I'm sure it will) check out some of his new \\"Bootleg Series\\" releases. There all live recordings through the past years. Some songs he has never recorded in the studio.
B001QGRIO8|5.0|I had no idea people were so unhappy with this book until I started looking online. I LOVED it! I am very much an adult bibliophile and I devoured each of the fabulous books in the Twilight series as quickly as I could get my hands on them. I loved the way Ms. Meyer tied her ends together and I found the last few chapters absolutely riveting. I don't know why people were complaining so much, but I think this book is excellent and totally on par with the first three in the series. Rock on, Stephanie!

0312539517|5.0|Ask anyone, any person on the street, who was the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest (I know because I tried this) and they will say one of two things: \\"I don't know,\\" or, \\"Sir Edmund Hillary.\\" After Paths of Glory, by Jeffrey Archer, has been on bookshelves for awhile, I think a new name will enter the lists.    Paths of Glory is an unabashed tribute to mountaineer George Mallory, who may very well have been the first to reach the peak of Mount Everest, but then again..... The book is a fact-based biography of Mallory that takes the reader from his school days as a boy in England, to the day in 1924 when his widow, Ruth, receives his last letter posthumously, his body lost on Everest. The story is as exciting and suspenseful as if it were total fiction, written for optimal impact, but it all actually happened, including the mystery of whether or not Mallory made history on that climb in 1924.      In 1999 Mallory's body was found by climbers who had received information that led them to the general location. They looked for several specific clues, one could even stretch it to say \\"proofs\\", of whether or not George Mallory was the first man to conquer Everest, and what they found or didn't certainly convinced me of who belongs in the history books.    Paths of Glory is part biography, part suspense, part mystery, and totally unforgettable.
0670451495|5.0|Make Way for Ducklings may indeed be my favorite book from childhood. It is also beautifully illustrated. It will keep your children captivated from the beginning to the end.    It is a wonderful tale about a mother and father duck who look for a home in which to raise their ducklings. Eventually they find that home in the Boston Public Gardens. There is a wonderful scene where they are about to cross a busy Boston street and a friendly policeman holds up traffic until they reach safety.     It is a wonderful story about the nurturing love of parents for their children. The ducks are imbued with a humanized aspect of that love. It is a book that will make children come to appreciate animals, especially ducks.    I have wonderful memories of my mother reading this to me as a child. I would suggest that you do the same with your children. It will create a lasting memory that they will cherish forever.    Davis Aujourd'hui, author of the humorous \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\"

B001NESPHC|5.0|It is rare that you purchase a CD and like every song.  She is very unique in her style and the songs.  I first heard Who Will Take Care of Me on the radio and then decided to purchase the CD. I hope she will do more cds.  No matter if you like a soft love song, or mixture of a little pop - she can do it all in a very enticing, relaxing, get you moving mood.  Highly recommend this CD.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|This movie was awesome.  I LOVE it and would watch it everyday if I had the time.  This is a TRUE love story to me.  Not Curious Case of Benjamin Button (BORING).  Give it a try.  I believe you will not be disappointed.
0307266303|5.0|This book is absolutely phenomenal. It covers so much ground (literally), from science to history to philosophy. The narrative of the book's protagonist (Caballo Blanco) and the inaugural Copper Canyon ultramarathon is exhilarating. Born to Run is densely packed with running wisdom and reads like an adventure novel. This book is suitable for anyone, not just runners. The inspiration in Born to Run is on par with any notable Olympic performance and transcends the typical \\"for runners only\\" stigma. I implore you to pick up this book, you won't be disappointed.
1569242739|5.0|I bought this book having never baked a cupcake in my life. My cupcakes were delicious the first time out and now I'm addicted to cupcake baking! The book is easy to understand and is an all-out great read! One suggestion to readers: if the authors give  you advice (like buying an oven thermometer)- TAKE IT. They're the cupcake experts and will guide you to awesome cupcakes all the way!
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|When my wife and I first saw this film we emerged from the theater into the chill night feeling shell-shocked and drained.    Both of us had been blindsided by the experience, not having imagined, going in, how a film about a giant monster loose in Manhattan could possibly provide the basis for a truly thrilling or even remotely scary film experience. Well, boy were WE wrong.    I gather that a significant number of folks posting reviews here do not agree with me in this assesment. But, hey, that's why filmgoing is a subjective experience.    For me, the reason 'Cloverfield' is an instant classic, and a truly unique cinematic event, is because it throws out all the rules of conventional narrative -- yes, at the same time borrowing a few aspects from other films in the process -- and simply plunging the audience headlong, and often without explanation, into a nerve-jangling nightmare of apocolyptic proportions.    Spielberg, in many ways, set the scene, tonally speaking, with his more conventioanlly constructed 'War Of The Worlds' in 2005. That provided a template for how a microcosmic view of macrocosmic events -- often without the relative comfort of rational explanations -- could effectively pull the psychological rug out from under an audience, subjecting them to a primal, child-level fear of the unknown.    And now, building on Spielberg's earlier apocolyptic invasion by forces beyond our understanding or experience, director Matt Sherman and producer J.J. Abrams have created an even more nightmarish experience by entirely stripping away a conventional narrative approach and having the whole experience viewed through the unblinkingly harsh lens of a home-video camera.    This device has been previously -- and most famously -- used by the makers of 'The Blair Witch Project', and, subsequently, by the original makers AND re-makers of Rec./Quarantine. And, in each case, this was a very effective choice, absolutely intrinsic to the impact of the narrative and to itsfeel of queazy immediacy.    But only in the case of 'Cloverfield' has this intimate and claustrophobic device been applied to the telling of truly EPIC events. And that was 'Cloverfield's creative masterstroke.     Of course, the ultimate blue-print for this approach was first introduced to the world in the many indelible home-video images of 9/11 and its aftermath. Never before had the world witnessed such monumental destruction in such an intimate and immediate way -- personal hand-held video-diaries of Armageddon.    And, because of the utilization of this narrative device, coupled with the related removal of any musical score, the audience is thus removed from its typical movie \\"comfort zone\\" and subjected to a much more raw experience -- a million miles away from anything so quaint and comforting as giant monsters destroying Tokyo.    In one fell swoop kid-stuff becomes vid-snuff!     And my hat is off to the entire creative team on this one for creating the most believable CGI world I've ever seen. Believable because \\"invisible\\" in the sense of not drawing attention to its own existence.    Even in the brilliant realization of the creature itself, the wise decision of not letting the audience get too protracted or clear a look was crucial to the overall feeling of nightmarish reality the filmmakers were going for.    And they succeeded in spades, even if the resulting experience was too jarring, offputting, and uncomfortable to translate into massive box-office blockbuster status.    Folks, this is simply NOT your Dad's monster movie.    Nope.    'Cloverfield' is a whole new animal.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|It's so rare to find a film that just plain makes me feel good.  I can't remember much of what I was doing when ABBA was all over the radio, but it must have been something that has stayed deep in my subconscious.  I find myself getting joyfully teary-eyed when I hear the songs, and should probably see a therapist to dig out the connections.  The bottom line is that the songs affect me deeply, and Mamma Mia!, for all its supposed faults, kept me smiling throughout.  Heartfelt thanks to all who made it possible.
0385341008|5.0|Charming, anecdotal, and heart-wrenching. This is a novel that you will not soon forget. Superb!
0805080120|5.0|Understandable, readable, but best of all, enjoyable explanation of the destructive and creative forces acting upon language. This book will convey you a \\"big picture\\" of how our present languages could have evolved into their present state and is mainly aimed at the interested layperson or at beginner students of linguistics, not for specialists (or maybe for those specialists that would like to read an overview of their science field from a humorful perspective).    The destruction of language structures, as well as the creation of new ones is explained with very illustrative examples taken fom a wide variety of languages and from different historic periods. (Other reviewers have already explained the involved forces). Most 20th/21st century linguists believe that the same forces that acted on prehistoric languages should be the same forces at play now, so by observing present (or at least more or less recent) language changes we should be able to understand the forces that shaped our current languages.     Creative changes are harder to observe than destructive ones, since it is easier to observe a present irregularity and look for its origin in the past (the action of a destructive force) than to look at something that looks regular now and imagine that sometime in the past it was irregular. Therefore, the only way to observe such creative processes is by noting an irregularity in some old text, which has somehow become regular in the present. This difficulty gave rise to the widespread idea among 19th century experts that language was only decaying. Although linguists have finally managed to observe some creative phenomena, these are not enough to compensate for the erosion that is evident in languages. Maybe written language and the existence of formal \\"grammar\\" and \\"ortography\\" are hindering or at least slowing down the creative processes. Linguists still do not know if this situation will lead us to a frightening erosion of meaning and structure in language(for example almost all noun cases existing in Proto-Indo-European, Latin and some Germanic languages are disappearing). Personally, I do not believe language will deteriorate to that point, since the very function of language (communicating meanings between individuals) would be threatened. Therefore, maybe we will reach some critical point and afterwards there will be a Cambric explosion of meaning and structure, it's a pity we will probably not witness this.
0670287059|4.0|This is a baby board book with a better-than-average illustrations, and accompanying rhyming verse.  There is an \\"I spy\\" component where the text indicates the reader should look for characters from nursery rhyme and fairy tale characters.  An excellent addition to a board book collection which will maintain interest through  the time a child is ready to follow a story line.

B001S2PT3M|5.0|DEXTER is a series on Showtime that is about to start its fourth season. Fortunately those who have never been exposed to DEXTER now have the opportunity. You're one of those few? Then let me inform you as season two arrives on blu-ray disc.<br /><br />DEXTER stars Michael C. Hall as Dexter Morgan, a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department. If anyone knows anything at all about forensics, especially blood splatters, it's Dexter. Partly because he's been educated in that field. And also because he happens to be a serial killer.<br /><br />But Dexter is no normal serial killer. Having shown homicidal tendencies when he was young, his police officer foster father Harry (James Remar) trained him how to murder and get away with it. Harry's rules are what have guided Dexter as he selects criminals who get off on technicalities, only the worst of the worst, to eliminate.<br /><br />Season one introduced us to Dexter and his sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), another police officer as well as the rest of the department members. Officer Angel Batista (David Zayas) is a solid friend to Dexter while Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) seems to know something just isn't right. Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez) tries to keep tabs on things but by seasons end was dropped from head of her squad to officer once again due to police politics.<br /><br />The series doesn't just dwell on Dexter's proclivity for killing people, it revolves around each member of the squad, how they interact and what's going on in their lives as well. But we also get to meet Dexter's girlfriend Rita (Julie Bienz) and her family as well, the perfect cover for Dexter, a man without emotion as he reminds us during numerous voice overs that give us a glimpse as to who he is.<br /><br />Fans spent season one with Dexter as he tried to find another serial killer that kept leaving clues specifically for him. Season two finds Dexter trying to find himself. Problems from the first season find him faking addiction and being forced by Rita to go to a 12 step program. It is there that he meets Lila (Jaime Murray) who becomes his sponsor. But there is more to Lila than we know.<br /><br />As season 2 opens the underwater burial ground that Dexter uses to dispose of his victims is accidentally discovered. This leads to the unearthing of over 18 victims and a major manhunt for what is termed the Bay Harbor Butcher. As large a case as this becomes, the FBI is called in led by the special agent who handles serial killers, Agent Lundy (Keith Carradine).<br /><br />As with the first season, the story jumps around to different stories involving each character with Dexter at the center. Lila becomes a bit more than Dexter's sponsor which pulls apart his relationship with Rita and her family. But that had more problems with the appearance of Rita's mother (JoBeth Williams) who has issues of her own. And Doakes begins to suspect there is more to Dexter than ever going so far as to tail him.<br /><br />Office romances come round this season in the most unlikely of places. Obvious choices for these are passed over. And the emotions that Dexter swears don't exist within him seem to rear their ugly heads more often this season than the first. Perhaps it is Dexter's refusal to believe he has any feelings that demonstrates the biggest case of denial in the series.<br /><br />Will Dexter get caught? Will Lila disrupt what Dexter and Rita have? Will Dexter's sister find romance with the right man? Will Angel and his wife get back together? Will Doakes ease up on Dexter or discover his secret? And along the road to recovery via the 12 step program, will Dexter give up his life of murderous justice?<br /><br />The series is brilliant. Sure I know, it sounds odd to say that about a show that turns a serial killer into the greatest anti-hero of all time. But that's what makes it so great. While watching you find yourself rooting for Dexter only to sit back later and realize he's a killer.<br /><br />The show is not only one of the wittiest written dramas seen in ages, it offers a heavy dose of dark comedy as well. Off hand remarks Dexter makes or thinks, set ups with charters who don't realize what Dexter is and coincidences that make for some hairy moments are found throughout.<br /><br />By the last two episodes of this season I was clawing at the remote, restraining myself from fast forwarding just to find out the results of all the threads running throughout the story. I'm glad I remained patient and watched them without fast forward. It left me with a satisfied feeling that few shows offer. And dying to see season 3 and season 4.<br /><br />I can't begin to praise this series more than I already have. And my admiration for the show and it's stars grows with each new season I watch. I'm dying to find out what happens in season three enough that I may have to take lunch for several weeks so I can go out and buy it! It's a good enough series that, dare I say this....I might be inclined to order Showtime just to watch it.<br /><br />Does the blu-ray help here? Honestly I can't say one way or the other, having watched season 1 on regular DVD. Beads of sweat on brows in the hot Miami heat glisten more, Dexter's stubble almost offers individual hairs and facial flaws are more obvious on people. Perhaps the best thing it offers is the cleanest picture to be found and that's worth something.<br /><br />Dexter is not for everyone. But for those with the same off kilter sense of humor I have or who want to see a good whodunit, this will meet your criteria. And at the same time it might just give you a laugh or two. Sure you might feel just a touch of guilt laughing about a serial killer. But after all, it's only a TV show. At least we can hopees, it offers a heavy dose of dark comedy as well.

I enjoyed reading about this woman who makes all this money then all of a sudden makes very less. Yet she finds solace in what she is now doing.<br />  She finally see's that what she was doing before was basically killing her, she was becoming someone she did not want to become. But becoming a housekeeper changed all that. She seen that there was more to life then this old job she had. And plus she finally found love for good.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|This album certainly is in the category of those albums made by great superbands that when launched didn't get the mass approval of all fans nor all the desired hits but 10 or 15 years after their release are praised by critics and new fans. Maybe in 10-15 years all new fans to the band (like someone starting to gain interest today in Pink Floyd or other 60-70 legendary bands) will praise these album so much and wonder how come some fans didn't like it. I have only heard this album a few times and it came somehow as a shock, all this analog and uniform sound and all songs sounding like the other and no real hooks or instantly recognized melodies but this is this type of album that you certainly need to hear more times as the instrumentation, chords and melodies are more complex than meets the eye.
B000002GFC|5.0|This album compiles most of Cream's best songs from their three albums, and is a great place for new fans of the band to begin.  It's got all the big radio hits and several great album cuts.  As with any hits compilation, there are going to be some songs missing.  In this case, the biggest absense in my opinion is Tales of Brave Ulysses, my second favorite Cream song after White Room.  But mostly, this compilation is both complete and concise, with no filler.  Great for new listeners and fans who just want the band's most recognizable hits.  4.5 stars.

0785116885|3.0|Planet Hulk was amazing, and I love the characters introduced there who would go on to become the Warbound.  World War Hulk was pretty disappointing, although several of the tie-in mini series were decent.  This one directly follows the events of World War Hulk and its epilogue, and places the Warbound in a new adventure.  The story itself is fairly pedestrian, and involves a generic plot by the Hulk foe The Leader.  The art is servicable, but nothing special.  The action was drawn relatively well, but some panels did feel a bit cramped.<br /><br />There is a bit of nice background information given on each of the members of the Warbound in some new flashback scenes that take place on Sakaar mostly before the events of Planet Hulk.  Those scenes don't really tie into the main story, but they do give some new insight to the characters' personalities and histories.<br /><br />Overall, the book was pretty average, and should be fairly enjoyable for anyone who likes the characters from Planet Hulk and wants to read more of them.
1416955070|5.0|As I've gotten older I've become somewhat disenchanted with the young adult genre.  Contemporary writers who write for teens all seem to have the same ho-hum voice and mediocre writing skills.  That's why I was so blown away when I picked City of Bones up from the shelf, admiring the shiny cover as well as the hunky guy decorating it, and was sucked into an amazing world full of all my favorite supernatural characters: vampires, fairies, werewolves, warlocks, demons and Clare's fabulous Shadowhunters.  Cassandra Clare is nothing like the average young adult author, she has a unique voice and promising talent.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories about the supernatural and forbidden romance!
B000RZOR2U|5.0|The complete Sacred Cantatas of J.S.Bach [boxed set] with Nicolas Harnoncourt and Gustav Leonhardt sharing conducting honors is a profound musical experience at an astonishing value. Each of the 199 cantatas is unique and show Bach's unlimited wealth of melody, harmonic richness and powerful use of chorus, solo voices, and instruments. Most of the cantatas are between 15 and 25 minutes long and the normal plan is Chorus, Recitative, Aria, Recitative, Aria, & Chorale. Within this small design (which is by no means static throughout the set) Bach creates an intense world of spiritual fervor whatever your beliefs might be. The production value is very good (recorded in the early 80's on period instruments). Btw, I also listen to alt-rock music from Radiohead to Dillinger Escape Plan, so if your tastes are eclectic buy this set - the Bach seriously rocks.
1416972242|5.0|Who said anticipation only sets you up for a letdown?  Whoever it was clearly never read the second installment in Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments series.  After devouring City of Bones I couldn't wait for City of Ashes to come out, couldn't wait to get more of the romance and the racing action.  This novel held me rapt until the very last page, there was never a dull moment. I loved Jace, Clary, Simon, Alec, and Isabelle from the first novel and they only grew on me more as I consumed the thrilling tale of their tumultuous lives.  Clare's novels are perfect, with strong characters, a gripping story, and a style the makes you feel the action.  If you loved, or even liked, City of Bones read City of Ashes now!!
1439130833|5.0|This is a great way to keep your mind in the right place.  thanks!
1416914307|5.0|The amazing third novel in Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments series, City of Glass, was the perfect conclusion to the enchanting tale!  I was so excited for this book to come out that I dragged my dad to the bookstore the day it came out as soon as the store opened even though we were on vacation.  Despite all of the excitement I built behind City of Glass's release I was not disappointed, I was entirely satisfied in my lust for more of Clare's enthralling world of demons, Shadowhunters, Downworlders, and forbidden love.  I tried to pace myself reading this book and it still seemed to go by too fast.  This book is amazing and I would definitely recommend it!
B00006F7S4|5.0|so, my first child loved to fall asleep upright, dancing to cesaria evora and the like... i tried that with number two to no avail. after experimenting with a few different albums, SEA CHANGE became the go-to album. In the process, the songs grew on me, especially (for whatever reason) the odd-numbered tracks. This is not typical Beck by any means, but the David Spade/Dana Carvey/Waiter at Roberto's in the Bronx look-alike delivers with a presence that builds my overall respect for him. I saw Beck live in Portugal back in 2001 at a rock festival and he was just having a good time, bugging out in the rain, making jokes like no one there understood english. that was a young Beck. This album is no young Beck. Even if you don't need to put your infant to sleep, it's the perfect album to sit and wallow in your lonesome misery!
0143036238|5.0|Before I read this book I saw the 2005 film starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen.  I loved the movie and I was inspired instantly to read Jane Austen's classic novel.  Despite the fact that I had already seen the movie and knew the general progression of events I was still captivated by the novel.  Jane Austen writes with an incredible literary style that is lacking in the works of most contemporary authors.  She has an eloquence of words that is complex and yet far easier to read than most people seem to think.  Though I am usually not a fan of novels that are based in reality without any hint of the supernatural I was enthralled by Austen's timeless love story which will leave every female reader pining for the dark and brooding Mr. Darcy.
B001V7YWTQ|4.0|I just recently purchased the Blind Faith album in anticipation of seeing Clapton/Winwood this summer (June 20 - Omaha).  I have to say I've found the BF stuff OK.  Some of it I really like - but not stellar.  What strikes me about this live CD is how the BF writing, coupled with Clapton's and Winwood's skill/maturity playing live through the years really come together phenomenally well.  The standout tracks for me are \\"Well All Right\\", \\"Voodoo Chile\\", \\"Split Decision\\", \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\", \\"Double Trouble\\", and \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\".  This last track I find especially fascinating to compare with the BF version.  It's an interesting study in having it be so \\"raw\\" when done by BF but the version I'd describe on this CD as simply \\"beautiful\\".  I'm struck by how I think Clapton's live stuff (in general) is so much better than his studio stuff.  Check out \\"One More Car, One More Rider\\" - unbelievable.
0060557818|3.0|Having heard Neil Gaiman praised many times as a master writer by friends and critics alike I decided to pick up one of his books.  Neverwhere was my first Neil Gaiman novel and, though I would like to say I loved it, I was a bit disappointed.  There is no doubt that Gaiman is a magnificent writer, his prose are lyrical and engaging.  However, I found Neverwhere difficult to get through.  Try as I might to fall in love with the story of Richard Mayhew I found myself getting bored as he tagged along with the Lady Door and her companions.  Though I did enjoy the book it was certainly not what I had hoped for from someone who came as well recommended as Neil Gaiman.  Though the story dragged in several places I did enjoy the ending and Richard's great character arc.  All in all, the story was amusing enough but it didn't nab a spot on my favorites list. Still, I will give Gaiman the benefit of the doubt and try one of his other novels.

B001NLL8LA|5.0|He's back in New York City and the story is great. The 400+ pages go by in a heartbeat in a terrifically entertaining story that starts with a middle of the night subway ride. Before it ends Jack Reacher runs afoul of the New York City Police Department, the FBI, some DoD agents, a former Delta Force operative who is a candidate for the senate, and three formidable females: one a NYPD officer, who is nice, and two from southwest Asia who are definitely not nice. (Of the \\"good\\" guys, the NYPD comes across as the most rational and professional--art imitating life!). The midtown area of Manhattan begins to seem like a character as well, but unfamiliar as Reacher goes about his business late at night. Bad guys, beware. He's back. And this book is as good as the best of the earlier Reacher novels. I recommend it highly, but I am disappointed by the Kindle price, $14.58, which is only 27 cents less than the hardcover price.    (update: On May 28, 2009, just nine days after it went on sale at its pre-order price of $14.58, the price of the Kindle edition of Gone Tomorrow was reduced to $9.99. This seems to be the way Amazon operates with some new Kindle books; they refuse to refund the difference which they have always done in the past when a price changed right after a purchase. This certainly takes the bloom off the Kindle. The moral of the story is do not pre-order or buy a new title for a few days until the Kindle price drop comes.)
B0011HF6GE|5.0|After listening to For Emma, Forever Ago, it should come as no surprise that Justin Vernon, aka Bon Iver, wrote and recorded the majority of the album during his stay in an isolated cabin in northern Wisconsin. The wintry aesthetic translates beautifully into music that evokes soulfulness and pathos. Vernon's haunting falsetto is paired with sparse instrumentation in intimately produced arrangements. For Emma, Forever Ago is a personal affair that deals with love and loss in impressionistic, opaque verses open to interpretation.  Despite the desolate recording backdrop, the album's ambiance is warm and inviting, especially on beautiful acoustic ballads like \\"Lump Sum\\" and \\"Re: Stacks.\\"  Originally self-released in 2007, Jagjaguwar picked up For Emma, Forever Ago for redistribution early this year. Now, as trees grow barren and frost covers the ground, you don't want to miss this album a second time.    Rating: 92/100
B001V7YWTQ|4.0|The 2CD version (there's also a DVD available) of the MSG Clapton/Winwood concert is pretty solid - for the most part, the vocals and playing are strong, though there are a couple of lackluster cuts (I'm not 100% into some of the blues tunes), but on balance, i'm pretty satisfied with the song choices (I favor the Blind Faith and Traffic material; see other reviews and tracklistings for hilights of the setlist, which others have covered well).  I didn't get a chance to see any of these shows, so i'm looking forward to viewing the DVD to see what it looked like visually, as i also couldn't immediately tell who was soloing on some songs - Winwood also played guitar at these shows, and he's a more-than-capable player, as we've known for a long time.  I'd like to have heard \\"Dirty City\\", their excellent collaboration from the last Winwood album; I'm not sure if they played it in their set, or if it was omitted from this CD due to re-record restrictions?  Overall, though, if you're a Clapton and/or Winwood fan, there should be plenty here to satisfy, until they hit the road again this summer.  They are two of `the real deals', and it's very cool that that they linked up for these shows and that they've been recorded for all to hear.
B001C3KCSY|2.0|Kings of Leon worked with Jacquire King to co-produce their latest album, Only by the Night, which takes noteworthy bounds forward in production value. This time around, their anthemic southern rock has been recalibrated with a new sonic palette more befitting of stadiums than taverns.    The album opens on a high note with heavily-affected guitar and atmospherics that add an interesting twist to lead singer Caleb Followill's distinctive bluesy vocals. Unfortunately, the first two cuts, \\"Closer\\" and \\"Crawl,\\" stand a notch above the rest, meaning that the album effectively peaks in the first eight minutes. The third track, \\"Sex on Fire,\\" a questionable selection for the album's lead single, aspires to epic heights with muscular guitar riffs but is weighed down by clunky songwriting. In fact, its vapid chorus, \\"And you/Your sex is on fire,\\" perfectly characterizes the rest of Only by the Night's lyrics.    Most of the writing on the album seems to cherry-pick from juvenile rock 'n' roll clichés. Even the high-gloss sheen of the production loses its appeal in the middling second half of the album, which finds the band rearranging compositions to create a second rate carbon copy of the mediocre first half. Such homogeneity nullifies some of the band's strengths, such as Followill's exceptional vocals.    The main problem with Only by the Night is that Kings of Leon chose to spend their time honing form instead of function-it fits the mold of epic stadium rock, but on closer listen offers little substance.
0894803123|5.0|It has all the great recipes plus the ones they only make at their flagship shop, such as Coffee Heath Bar Crunch and Cantalope. I also like their cute bio on how they got into ice cream.<br /><br />The recipes are easy and simple because they don't cook the eggs. If you worry about salmonella, just heat the custard mixture or coddle the eggs to kill any possible bacteria. As for us, we just use them raw.<br /><br />I use this in companion with my Kitchenaid Mixer Ice Cream Bowl attachment. The recipes make just the right amount for the mixer.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I don't understand why the cover calls this \\"Michael Moore's funniest movie to date\\". I didn't find anything funny about it at all. I just today received an email from President Barack Obama saying \\"I need your voice on health care\\" (reform). I would like to send him this movie in response. Everyone should see this movie now, before it is too late.

B00003CX9W|3.0|I was really excited to buy this movie and see it again and show it to the children. I thought that they would enjoy it... boy was I wrong!  I guess that's the difference between my generation and kids nowadays... they have to have protagonist and an antagonist and some kind of plot!! They were really upset that all there was to it was music and short clips.  Personally I loved it... but I guess this is the age of spongebob squarepants nonsense (don't get me wrong I love the little guy) but there isn't really much appreciation for the more classy works!  Times are changing...
B00280LYHS|5.0|As a student of history with a love (and a minor!) in classics, and little kid at heart I loved this series of books, culminating in The Last Olympian--maybe the best in the series. The obvious comparison is to Harry Potter, but these books are really something different. They're a little lighter, and a little more fanciful, and just more 'colorful.' They are shorter and and just more fun with less dark overtones (imo.)<br /><br />This last story brings about a conclusion to the whole saga, with one battle after another, answers all your question and even gives our heroes the accolades they richly deserve. It seems its the last one in the series and thats a little sad.
0061478784|4.0|I first saw Hayao Miyazaki's animated film and read this book afterwards. It was really a double treat because the film and the book are vastly different and they are both excellent. Diana Wynn Jones is a good storyteller and writer,. You will especially like her work if you amongst the Harry Potter crowd. Miyazaki's film however, is an absolute must-see adventure-romance epic. He changed plot elements that didn't work and cast his magic animée spell and a materpiece was created. My whole family was enthralled with it and watched it many times over.
B0006B2A42|4.0|At the time this film was released, the spy satellite at the center of the story was considered a science fantasy.  We know better now. Cold war thriller with all the implausible elements all too plausible in the present time.
B000PC1JL2|5.0|Great album, just one of many made by Marley that just flows. Well recorded too suprisingly, considering a lot of reggae and blues were not.

0765342294|5.0|A wonderful \\"coming of age\\" story.    A great sci-fi novel.    An insightful look into how the young are brainwashed into the \\"game\\" of adulthood.    And incredibly prescient considering it was written in 1977. There is an Interent with bloggers and the kids all have wireless laptops are a couple of examples.

1905654294|3.0|Personally, I didn't find this the best of the series. It had a totally different feel from the other novels, most likely because there was a totally different kind of story going on here.    There were ocassional sweet feelings expressed but nothing compared to the twinge of romance that the other novels definitely had. I felt that this novel was definitely down to business and more uptight than the others which seemed to flow easily and keep you interested. I had read the other books in a day or two, but this one took me weeks because it didn't have the same flavor.    Otherwise, all your favorite characters are there. Interesting relationships spark up between the werewolves and the vampires, even among those who you never would have imagined. Even the relationships among the vampires themselves and the werewolves themselves was surprising; events in the La Push pack and in the Volturi were unexpected.    The rest of the story was not so good.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|I am with mixed feelings about this set, but right now I'm leaning towards an all-out PAN of this Blu-Ray release of these movies. I've been noticing that a lot of the reviews say \\"THIS IS A FAITHFUL RESTORATION OF THE ORIGINALS!!!!\\". Well that wasn't what I got in this set.<br /><br />I wanna know what the 4 and 5 star reviewers were smoking when watching this set. Now yeah it's true that this set contains less grain than the 2001 DVD release. But I want to know what Coppola was doing in the year it took him to restore the films.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the set, I put in the disc for the first one and watched it. The wedding scene at the beginning is where I noticed how over-saturated the picture is. The whites look more blue than white. THe rest of the film wasn't more different. At times there was a noticeable and annoying red tint over some certain scenes that made the picture look bad.<br /><br />Part 2 was not much different either. The opening scene with the kissing of the hand had an annoying orange tint over it. Upon seeing this, I asked myself \\"Who restored this? Heidi Montag???\\". There was notable print damage in some scenes too.<br /><br />One reviewer stated that there were some parts that looked like they had adjusted the F-Stop, and it was distracting. I couldn't agree more. That happened a LOT throughout Part 3, especially the ending. Sad thing is, the worst in the series (Part 3) looked the best. I can't say the same for Part 1 and 2 though.<br /><br />The extras were fine, no complaints. People are bitching about the TV versions not being on here- I beg to differ. I don't care a single bit about the TV versions. The audio is not bad, bough you have to have the right sound system for it.<br /><br />In short, just keep the original set. If you need so desperately to buy this set, buy it for the extras only.
B000001DYA|5.0|This is the classic BLUE CHEER album that belongs in every collection of HARD ROCK.  Though I think their follow up (OUTSIDEINSIDE) is even better (though not as noisy) VINCEBUS ERUPTUM is the record all headbangers should own.  Blasting out with their Top 20 hit cover of \\"Summertime Blues\\" (#14 March 1968) followed by the slow Blues baste \\"Rock Me Baby\\" then the droning buzzing stunning stoner Noise anthem \\"Doctor Please...\\" this power trio was \\"Dazed and Confused\\" a full year before LED ZEPPELIN adopted BLUE CHEER's formula and then went on to dominate anything we'd now call HEAVY METAL (at least as far as record sales).  The second half of VINCEBUS ERUPTUM is for Joe Guts who got thru the first; \\"Out Of Focus\\" BLUE CHEER intends their listener to be, then cover and kick  \\"Parchment Farm\\" (or \\"Parchman Farm\\" I think these guys listened to records and then covered them by ear) and just in case you're still standing, BLUE CHEER figured they'd close with and kill ya the \\"Second Time Around\\".  Bassist vocalist DICKIE PETERSON wrote half, plus the band reworked old Blues tunes and cool covers in a scorchingly loud, pounding, sloppy, feedback-heavy style that was unique in 1968.  BLUE CHEER belongs in the Valhalla of greatest Rock Bands, but sadly, these days, warrant nary a mention.
B0017CW5J4|5.0|I was a bit skeptical at first because some of the reviews for this product are not so great. I'm glad to say that any worries I had were unnecessary!<br /><br />Although nothing compares to seeing them in person (which I've done twice) the Blu-ray release comes as close as you can possibly get. The HD quality is incredible, but what makes this so great is the amazing sound quality! If you buy this, make sure you set it to 5.1 surround sound in the setup menu. For some reason, the default sound setting is stereo, which is awful if you're listening to it on a surround sound system.<br /><br />Once you set it to 5.1, the sound will blow you away! The only thing I found to be odd about the show is the fact that there was singing during quite a few parts. The Blue Man Group typically only has acoustic songs, so the vocal work is unusual, but still good and fitting.<br /><br />Overall, if you have a Blu-ray player this is a necessity! I strongly recommend it!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|When I first saw these guys perform \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" on David Letterman, I was so knocked out by their 3-part harmonies & their folky music style that I had to get this disc immediately.<br /><br />I've recently been on a CD-buying frenzy...call it an addiction, but what a good addiction to have. My musical tastes are most likely more far-reaching than the average schmoe, so you can probably imagine the size of my CD collection, and the amount of music I have in my iTunes catalog. And I am telling you in utter honesty: This is one CD I keep coming back to time and again. For old hip-eyes like me, this CD, in many ways, is a grand throwback to the glory days of the acoustic troubadors of the late 60's/early 70's. (God, if we could bring those days back...) As such, I firmly believe that Fleet Foxes can and should find audiences with fans of the early Eagles; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; Poco; early America; Nick Drake; Don McLean; James Taylor...and their more recent contemporaries, the super-trio The Thorns.<br /><br />A gorgeous-sounding, multi-talented band with a heart that write songs that will have you joyously singing along with them, grateful that priceless music like this exists today...songs that haunt you deliciously long after they're over. Do not miss out on Fleet Foxes. I can't wait for the chance to see them in concert.
B001993Y2C|5.0|This is one of the best television shows ever made. It is brilliantly written, acted, and filmed. It is science fiction for intelligent people. That being said, the price for this blu-ray collection is absolutely ridiculous and I will NEVER pay this much. I can probably afford it, but it is offensive.
B001RIY49C|5.0|So I picked this up today 5/20/09. I refuse to open it as a collector.  I wont review the movie because chances are if you are buying this version its not for the movie.<br /><br />This item is a 1:1 scale plastic replica so its about the size of my head! Its huge, the biggest DVD case Ive ever bought. The base has a tray that slides out to store the 5 DVDs and 1 Blu Ray disk. If you don't like that idea you can keep the DVDs in an included keepsake case. The Replica skull plays sound bites of guns and action scenes from the movie while the eyes light up. For a DVD CASE there is a great deal of detail that went into this. But keep in mind its just that a DVD case. Its not a side show replica that will cost you hundreds of dollars. It's simply a unique limited edition plastic replica DVD case painted chrome.<br />I bought mine at best buy and canceled my order on amazon. Yeah it cost me more money but the outer box is mostly clear plastic. This stands a good chance of being damaged in shipping. If you are a collector I suggest shelling out a few extra bucks and pick it up locally in person vs having it shipped if that option is available to you.<br /><br />Assuming you buy yours at Best Buy, and you are NOT a collector and actually plans on opening it- You may find \\"BEST BUY EXCLUSIVE\\" sticker on the front advertising a $50 Sideshow collectible gift card inside. I assume from reading the sticker this is only available at BEST BUY. So if there is no sticker assume there is no Gift Card inside.<br /><br />Now on to the Disks and features. You get the New SkyNet Edition Blu ray  disk, a digital copy, and all 4 special feature DVDs from both previous editions (Extreme and Ultimate editions) making this a 1 stop shop ultimate collection for any T2 fan who doesn't own any of the other versions.

B00005A3KS|5.0|Great movie!!!  Always loved it and now I can watch it when ever I want!
B0018PH3L0|1.0|I got this show based on the many high reviews, but when I actually watched it my reaction was very different.  The story is beyond gritty, it wallows in dirt.  For example,Robert Duvall's character is physically dirty, he rarely washes (this point is made clear), and has two pigs who are forever rooting in the dirt and eating trash as pets.  They chase after him repeatedly, but he never says a kind word to the animals.  Instead he curses them and achases them off, and he does so by kicking one leg up at them sidewise, eerily resembling another animal relieving itself.  We are apparently meant to take this warmly.    Duvall and Jones are run-down, crooked derelicts, with no plans in life other than to get by and evade the law.  Their idea of work is to venture across the Mexican border and steal livestock.  In the first episode we see them sneak up on their hapless Mexican victims and stampede a herd of the Mexicans' horses, driving them up to Texas and shooting at them while they commit the robbery.  They are whooping and laughing while they do it, like this is all a good time.  Are we supposed to sympathize with these outlaws?  They are not \\"good guys\\" in any sense.    Then there's meanness and brutality.  A young woman is trying to escape from the horrible people in Lonesome Dove, Texas, and, lacking the money for fare, jumps aboard a whisky boat in desperation.  This is a small barge manned by half a dozen of the filthiest, meanest, dumbest men you ever want to conjure in your worst nightmare.  While she cowers between the whisky barrels, they leer and grin at her, and talk about who's going to be first with her.  About then, the filthiest, most animal-like of them stabes another to death and throws him in the river, announcing that he's going to marry her.  She tells them that she's married, her voice getting fainter and...I'll spare you the rest.    I stopped watching, because it was all too depressing.  I'd like to have at least someone to root for.  The Duvall and Jones characters are not any form of heroes.  They have lapses in their criminality along the way, and maybe some people interpret this as goodness.  I did not.    The characters here are not merely bad, or outlaws, or flawed.  They're rotten, miserable people.  I'm sure there were some men like this in the early west, but I'm equally sure there were even more honest and hard working folks.  After all, the west did get built.  These miscreants, drunkards, woman beaters, murderers and rapists were not the ones who did it.      This story does not hold a candle to the many better westerns that have come before it.  Try watching The Naked Spur or Man From Laramie or The Searchers or many others and see for yourself.  Lonesome Dove is a mean-spirited anomaly.  I agree with whoever noted that it is definitely NOT for family viewing.
B00133KDM8|3.0|Tarja Tuuren has a nice voice. No, not a nice voice, an AMAZING voice. She is an amazing vocalist and Nightwish's fame is due in no small part to the work she did with them from '97 to '05.     So now she's on her own and making her own music. My Winter Storm, in my opinion, does an amazing job of showing its listening just how strong Tarja's voice is. Every track on this album gives its listener very high quality vocals.     However, other than that, its well... not that good. Tarja comes from a Metal background and this album really isn't proper metal. Most of the music is slow songs in the vein of Creek Mary's Blood from Nightwish's Once Album. And while that's an amazing song, I don't want an entire album of Creek Mary's Blood. Tarja made her name as a metal vocalist.... were did that go?    Furthermore, musically, this album is mediocre. Vocals alone do not make an album and no matter how good a vocalist Tarja is she needs good instrumentation to back her up. This album just doesn't have that. The music is, generally speaking, plain old boring. Ciarán's Well, one of the heaviest songs on the album is just plain BAD in fact.     Personally, while I know a lot of people don't really like Annette Olzon (Tarja's replacement in Nightwish) I think Nightwish is still the better band. Whoever is writing music for Tarja can't beat Tuomas Holopainen's music, or lyrics for that matter.     All in all, I'm rather disappointed with this album. I was expecting something... more. Something more epic and something better done. This isn't a bad album, but its not my favorite, not by a long shot.
B001CVCBLM|5.0|I recieved the package promptly, and with great enthusiasm, tore it open immediately. As soon as I popped it into my Bose sound system, layed back on the couch and shut my eyes, I knew I was ready for a life changing expierence. I pressed \\"play\\", and the world ended, and I was in Heaven. I highly suggest this album. It never gets old. Complete musical orgasm.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|The first I ever heard of Outlander was in an ad page in last month's Fangoria.  It looked and sounded like typical straight to video B movie fair.  This is sometimes a very good and fun thing, and other times absolutely dreadful.  From sifting through some other Amazon reviews regarding this film I found that it had a very, VERY,  limited theatrical run and apparently was bashed by critics.  Well, I still haven't read any 'professional' reviews for Outlander and I'm here to tell you that it's totally worth two hours of your life, especially if you're a creature feature fan and, even better, a sword and sandels epic fan.<br /><br />Basically, the premise of this movie is if Army Of Darkness was taken seriously.  We have a space man(from another dimension?  The future?  Antoher planet?) who crashes his space ship onto earth in the year 709 and brings a big monster with him, that of course escapes and starts problems for the local Viking villages and tribes.  That's it.  That's the story.  Nothing monumental or groundbreaking but totally fun.  Hell, this movie has the type of story I would have written myself when I was ten and wanted even more to see it in the multiplex.<br /><br />Don't get mislead by the Sci-Fi sounding premise, this is nothing close to true Science Fiction.  It's a big action/horror/ monster movie on the most base levels.  There's no science or hypothesis of the future or past of man to be found.  Sorry, it just doesn't reach that high above it's B movie roots, and that is not always a bad thing if it's done well.  It's obviously one of those films that has many different producers, most of which are not from the states, but the budget and level of polish on the production could be matched to any of the big summer films coming out now.  The sets are good and have the dirty lived in quality required for anything involving Vikings.  The CGI creature is mostly convincing.  There's a few shots where the beast looks less then stellar but not many.  The filmmakers were even smart, considering budget and suspense, by not revealing the creature in full light until the center of the film.  It reminded me of the old Roger Corman creature features, but he waited until the third act, well, because his monsters never looked that convincing and were always more convincing when off screen.  This could've been a big summer film of 09.  Of course it's not a remake, a film based on action figures, one of several sequels to 20 year old properties, and of course there's no car, fast food or toy tie-ins to speak of, but it still could've given me what I long for this summer, something NEW.<br /><br />The cast is all on spot.  Jim Caviezel(The Passion of the Christ, The Thin Red Line, Frequency) stars, and I've always found him to be an underrated actor.  He's turning into the king of big films that don't get a shot theatrically but become fan favorites on home video thanks to this and Highwaymen(if you haven't seen it, check it out).  The movie even throws us the usual respected older actor in the form of John Hurt to play the Viking king.  He's good as always and brings that extra John Hurt-ness he always brings to his roles, big or small.  If you've read Beouwulf you can figure out where the plot is going and what it's riffing on but the added Sci-Fi trope helps throw you off for a bit.  This isn't going to go down as one of Caviezel's great performances, but he does lend dramatic gravity to what essentially is the typical monosyllobic hero with a past role.  After about an hour his characters comes more into his own and leaves behind the usual action character cliche's thanks to him.  Ron Perlman shows up late into the film as an opposing tribes leader.  He's not give much to do, and I'm not sure why they cast an actor of his caliber for such an nothing part, but it's nice to see him anyway.<br /><br />The DVD looks and sounds great.  Plus, it's loaded with special features.  We get some neat special effects tests and animatics of the action scenes, which there are plenty of, and while they're nothing ground breaking, they are done well and leave one feeling satisfied.  There's also a great commentary track by the writers, director, producers and special effects technicians that covers so much ground there is no need for a making of doc.  They also react to their critics and talk about the original forms of the script.  Of course there's also 40 minutes worth of deleted scenes, all of which were rightfully ommitted from the final film.  There is an intersting alternate opening that's worth a look though.  Can't say the same for the alternate ending.<br /><br />At least give this one a shot at a rental.  You won't be disappointed.  Sure, the man from outer space might turn some viewers off, but I emplore you to open your mind and just smile while the B movie ride takes you away.  Don't be scared off by the lack of Happy Meals and Tom Cruise level of star power tie-ins. This is a quality B picture on the level of all the big budget B pictures you'll be plopping down 12 bucks to see this summer in theatres.  Yes, I'm looking at you Transformers 2 and Terminator:Salvation.here are plenty of, and while they're nothing ground breaking, they are done well and leave one feeling satisfied.

You just need to open a book and open your mind and stop getting your heath information from the television or the news because it's all biased and based on selling meat and dairy products at the expense of your health! You're loss and their gain. This book is so worth reading, i wish more people would care about what they put inside their bodies and for the animals welfare and the planet.  I recommend reading this book and i know anyone who does read it will be inspired!
B001B4JVKE|5.0|Living in the USA I was unable to attend this tour. However I pre-ordered The Collection when it was about to come out. Gosh I am glad I did. The CD is good but the DVD WOW. This is not only one my favorite Katie realted items I own but it is probably my favorite concert DVD. What a concert. It shows Katie at her best. So many great songs on the DVD it is great to see these songs performed live. I can only imagine what is was like being there. Also outstanding video and audio quality. The \\"Behind the Screens\\" bonus is also quite enjoyable to watch. I hope Katie and Co. keep making outstanding items like this in the future. No problems at all playing it on my computer.

B001JV5BIA|2.0|The movie was a huge disappointment. I thought it was going to be a update from the 1974 version. HA  The joke was on me. It says 2009 but still the same old version.  If I had known that I would never have bought it. What a joke.  Any one who buys this movie will be greatly disappointed.    Mary  Columbus,MS
0345410025|5.0|Weel, I had never taken a memory course before, but this book greatly enhanced my hability to remembre names, phone numbers and tasks, in only 3 weeks of training. There are more complex techniques, that require more practice (the memory graph, for example), but you can learn the simpler ones in little time. Anyway, you have to put effort on it, and practice a lot, until you master them all.

0199538115|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.<br /><br />But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pains. Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.<br /><br />Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.<br /><br />But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.<br /><br />Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.<br /><br />It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave.arch family will come alive, and never quite leave.
0240810961|5.0|This wonderful collection of Walt Stanchfield's drawing lessons is one of the happiest \\"finds\\" I have come across in a long time!<br /><br />While originally geared to Disney animators, the lessons are useful to almost anyone wanting to learn (or improve) character drawing. I have taken several years of art lessons, and putter around at both pencil and computer art, but it was clear right from the first few chapters that Walt's style was going to change the way I approached some of my drawing.  The easiest way to sum up the style presented in this book is \\"doing more with less\\". Looking at the emotion and action Walt was able to suggest with just a few simple lines is truly impressive.<br /><br />The book consists of 149 short chapters, each covering a particular area of drawing and often containing enjoyable and insightful narratives relative to the lessons.  This makes the book enjoyable reading even for those who are not interested in drawing this kind of art.<br /><br />An interesting, educational, and entertaining book! Highly Recommended. The second volume is also available: [[ASIN:0240811070 Drawn to Life: 20 Golden Years of Disney Master Classes, Volume 2: The Walt Stanchfield Lectures]]
B0002XMF5S|3.0|The album is great. The only complain I have is that in amazon appears the cover signed by Tommy Iommy, and I bought it for that signature! Unfortunately I received a regular cd without any signature, then now I have this album twice!

B0015DYIH2|3.0|i have read all of Stephanie Meyers books and they were ALL addicting. It is a must have.                   5 STARS
B001V5K3T6|1.0|As of May 21, 2009, this item is still listed as a DVD under the amazon.com department \\"Movies & TV\\".  THIS IS NOT a DVD MOVIE.  This should not be listed under \\"Movies\\".  This should be under books.  This is some \\"DVD Book\\" that you are supposed to read on your computer.  Instant return.  If I wanted to pay $10 to read the book I would have bought the paperback and saved my eyes in the process.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this series after watching the movie \\"Serenity\\" that was created due to this series's popularity,  which I really liked.. I was not disappointed at all with this series and wish I would have known about it first. I love this show and Nathan Fillion is GREAT I could watch him all day. More than that this show has great premise and special effects and action! I love the space cowboy aspect of this show and it has such a terrific well put together cast! I think if you like action and a little bit of the sci-fi side you'd love this series.. This is just a really great show and its to bad it wasn't appreciated while it aired.. I really don't even remember seeing it advertised.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie is very unique...from the acting, to the plot, to the way it was shot...the viewer will not be disappointed!  This is definitely Gerard Butler's (King Leonidas) breakthrough role!!  If you are a fan of the graphic novel by Frank Miller or of history in general you will love this movie!
0307278255|3.0|Much as I love the title of this collection and its stirring epigraph, the stories do not strike to the heart the way some of Lahiri's work does. Is it that they feel too tame this time around, too polished and well-behaved? Is Jhumpa Lahiri perhaps a virtuoso who needs a new song?    I want to see this glorious writer extend beyond her familiar territory into truly unaccustomed earth--what her book title promised this time, she should deliver next time!
031606792X|3.0|Twilight is her best work to-date.      Edward Cullen charater should be kept as he was written in the first book and not as a love sick boy to the selfish Bella character. Arrrrrrrrg.    Look at Jack Reacher and learn from Lee Child.  He's is the best and the master of keeping us inthrall with his creation.      New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn are mumble jumble and written for  $$$$$$$.  I'll read Twilight again and forget the rest.    I hope she is not a one book wonder.
B001FB4W16|5.0|Woo! 'True Blood' is a genre-bending, bloody good time! Creator and executive producer Alan Ball has really out done himself this time. Keeping along the lines of 'Six Feet Under' (Ball's first HBO series), death is everywhere, as well as vampires whom have come \\"out of the coffin\\" and now live amongst humans. Centered on a southern town in Louisiana, Bon Temps,mind reading waitress Sookie Stakehouse falls in love with 173 year old vampire Bill Compton, and the rest as they say is history. Along for the ride are memorable characters like Sookie's best friend, out-spoken Tara, her fabulously trashy gay cousin Lafayette, Sookie's idiotic brother Jason, and Sookie's boss Sam, whom is also in love with Sookie. The cast is all fantastic! Each player gets his/her own special time on screen and everyone of them are worth it. But the driving storyline is Sookie and Bill.  The result is an adult fantasy chock-full of sex, drugs, and vampires-all with accents! HBO has definitely got themselves a keeper! And it has never looked so good than it does on Blu! Yea!

B00005JLKB|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005JLKB Smallville - The Complete First Season]]    It took my friends literally years to convince me to buy this and watch it. I've always been a comic collector, superhero fan, etc. Just from first impression of the show I didn't think it would live up to what we all know of Superman and Clark Kent from the movies & comics. I thought it was more of a \\"kid\\" show or something along those lines that just wouldn't interest me. If you feel similar, give in and give it a try. I did and boy am I upset with myself that I waited so long! It's fantastic and a lot better than I ever expected it to be. There's a great mix of new & old in the Superman saga. Now I'm all caught up and enjoy it every week. :)
B001PU8N0I|5.0|A timeless 7.5 hour exposition on the disarming power of simple goodness uncorrupted by money, societal censure or familial decadence.    The British seem to have an endless procession of superb character actors, many of whom are employed here. All of the players perform marvelously; however, it is Claire Foy's incandescence which essentially carries this film. If the viewer does not literally/figuratively fall in love with Amy Dorrit, an ECG and an EEG are in order. Miss Foy's Amy Dorrit is the single most engaging silver-screen character I've encountered in several decades...the last being Kinski's Tess.  Little Dorrit, the film, does not have the sweep, majesty and poetry of Polanski's Tess of the D'Urbervilles (vast budget differential), but Dorrit's primary characters are more convincingly realized, in my opinion. One cannot legitimately compare the dramatic arrow of Dorrit with Tess...Dickens and Hardy inspected their respective worlds with entirely different lenses. Both heroines represent the archetypal ideal of purity and ingenuous innocence for whom you fear brutal violation. Therein lies the fundamental difference of the two novels. Dorrit is  dramatic (brief violence) with comedic relief. Tess; pure tragedy.       This is a complex multi-layered tapestry; carded, spun, dyed and designed by a master, woven here by several hands (directors), and filled with the typically Dickensonian collection of caricatures (who the medical world names syndromes after) which are animated with colorful aplomb.     This film requires patience, as the warp and weft are methodically shuttled and combed with deliberate care. There are flaws in the weave, but these are peripheral. The two central characters  (Amy Dorrit and Arthur Clennam) retain their noble integrity through every vicissitude. The secondary characters are so superb, you grow to love, tolerate, empathize with or hate them as intended. Marked over-length with trivial tangents, minor mis-casting, and un-necessary scenes are some of its flaws.         Your patience will be thoroughly rewarded in the final two chapters as you are inexorably pulled into the very fibers of the tapestry. Miss Foy's skills are unrivaled in the transcendence, power and authenticity she breathes into Amy. Her ethereal essence escapes the confines of the screen and fills the room with warmth, sweetness and light. To share one's life with such a being! Alas, we must settle for these 7.5 hours with her, and Arthur Clennam (only slightly less divine). Little Dorrit's infectious goodness charms even the worst of our species.    Father Dorrit, John Chivery, Mrs Clennam, Mr Pancks, Affrey, Auntie, and Rigaud are all magnificent; unforgettable...you will journey with these individuals a long time, I suspect. Amy will accompany you to your eternal rest.     Foy (Little Dorrit), Tovey (John Chivery), Courtenay (William Dorrit), and E. Marsan (Pancks)should be giving acting lessons to our icons who pull down 10-20 million a picture.     Timely sermon, given the Rigauds and Merdles that surround us; that have always surrounded us.    The product packaging, for a retail $50. set, is pathetically parsimonious.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|Their new CD is better than I expected.  I am so happy that they did not change their style.  The lyrics are deep and seductive.
B001TODCII|1.0|This film has more holes than my Kuru-riddled brain.    Treating a pernicious industry like the sex-slave-trade in a comic-book fashion is ludicrous and irresponsible. I've lived in SE Asia, working not in but alongside crusaders fighting this sorry malignancy. I know...it's only a movie. It's only the well from which our culture draws its knowledge.     The good guy (Liam) has less dimension than a straight line: he is simply not believable and thus is never engaging. Liam is always liam, whether in kilts, Jedi rags, WWII garb, Les Mis stripes, or chaps. Abysmal, our movie icons.   Anyway, the bad guys are NEVER shown being brutally bad, thus there is little reptilian satisfaction in their roastings, plumbings and guttings. Being one of the largest money-making businesses in the world, all of its prime-movers and lick-spittles are not morons, surely.    The film allows the viewer to know only a spoiled, perfidious, reckless teen-aged daughter...so where's the emotional investment for her plight?  Her mother (bitter-bitchy-ignorant but beautiful and shapely) is ex to Prozac-Crack-Liam, trophy-wife to handsome, rich-as-Croesus indulgent step-sugar daddy? No stereotypes here. Briefcase full of valid passports, ID's in reflections, homicidal trucks, venal trusted friends, etc...all original themes.        The final rewards are delivered at the endings (2)...landing at LAX, without a warm and fuzzy welcome from Interpol and the FBI? A singing audition for the air-headed kid? Did she learn nothing? Obviously a product of our public schools.   Come on, Hollywood, work on your introductions and endings (and everything in between). For instance, how the hell did they get off the yacht (with the other girls...he can't hand them over to the authorities) and out of France, severely wounded, with the miscreants and the police hot on their spoor? There is a good story there. A great story. Getting back across the Pond and into the US without the daughter's passport could have been another challenge...well, all right, fictionalize THAT challenge. And finally, disappearing into the fabric of LA/USA/upper Chad with reasoned vigilance and disabling paranoia would have been a reasonable exit.    You may enjoy the ride until there is a synaptic snap somewhere higher than your mesencephalon. If not, mark your territory again, just in case your essence is growing faint. Rehydrate yourself with another brew.  The reason I bothered reviewing the thing is because I enjoyed it on a visceral level. This one got derailed in the first few minutes...quite an accomplishment.

B00005V9IJ|1.0|The first disconnect involves the physics of the jet hitting the water and the resulting vectors of anything with mass, which certainly includes our hero. OK, the film's director/advisers never took physics in school. The second is the raw fact that this situation would have taxed the skills of an experienced survivalist. This nerd wouldn't have had a chance.  However, the circuit-breaker is the volleyball, Wilson, and all of the invested emotions surrounding it. It's a tragedy when it is lost at sea? Seriously?   Why not have the protagonist adopt an orphaned (deformed/crippled) baby bird, for instance. Imagine a fragile and utterly dependent entity filled with energy, song, and the joy of each new sunrise. Now imagine this crippled little life that you'd carefully nursed and nurtured for years; your entire reason for surviving, blown out to sea and lost in a maelstrom because of a moment of exhausted inattention.     This solitude could have sown a deep spirituality and profound respect for all life. Did our boy grow to honor the lives that gave him life? Obviously not, as he callously throws down the crab's leg and takes no notice of the other wasted lives at the company's banquet.   Solitude can be a path to enlightenment, as it has for many of history's sages. Our hero? He moons around his old, now married, girlfriend? He mopes around hotel rooms speaking of loss? He had no substance to lose, except adipose...     No Paradise Lost or found here. No Milton. No counterfeit Rousseau.     What was the point? Always carry a volleyball in your carry-on?
B001TH16DS|4.0|If you are a Star Trek fan, and especially if you are an original fan this is worth every penny.  I've only ever seen the original series as reruns on TV and I was truely shocked to see these on Blu Ray, the quality of the picture is way more than I expected from a series this old.    The only gripe which I took one star off for was in the sound as others have mentioned.  They could have put some more effort into equalizing the sound. Turning the volume up so you can hear the dialogue will result in being blown out of your chair when they cut scenes with music or throw in sound effects.  Turning the volume down to where the sound effects are acceptable leaves you completely unable to hear the dialogue.
B00004XQ83|5.0|My husband and I both love this CD.  It is so unique and different with wonderful harmonies by wonderful voices.  I didn't even know that the female voices I was listening to belonged to Allison Krauss and Emily Lou Harris until weeks later.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|A question:  What do you get when you mix a father who happens to be a self-help guru wannabe (Greg Kinnear); a foul-mouthed, lascivious (yet well meaning) grandfather (Alan Arkin); a sullen, rebellious teenager who refuses to speak (Paul Dano); a despondent, suicidal brother (Steve Carell); a cherubic, enthusiastic, young daughter (Abigail Breslin); and a frazzled mother trying to hold it all together (Toni Collette)?  Pick the daughter as a last-minute contestant for a preteen pageant hundreds of miles away, throw the family into a broken-down Volkswagon bus, and you've got LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, a delightful yet poignant comedy with a definite aftertaste.<br /><br />This is a film not for the faint of heart (there are some very adult themes that are vetted), and while the viewer is exposed to constant dysfunction and conflict and disruption, we do eventually learn that blood is thicker than water, as the Hoover family definitely circles the wagons when one of their own has her back against the wall.  The movie stays on track until the sudden flight from the hospital--when the metaphorical shark is jumped--yet for the most part LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is bawdy entertainment at its finest.  Special kudos to Carell and Arkin for terrific performances.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
B001ED7C58|5.0|I'm a 45 year old woman who still loves the 1980's bands and was digusted with the vast majority of popular music in the 1990s and early 2000s.  It all seemed to be either angry men screaming at me or Rap.    This soundtrack (and some other recent hits) have made me love modern music again. There is an actual melody to them and they sing, not scream.    This album has helped bring me back into the world of popular music again and I love it!
B000005RT8|3.0|Well, maybe not a V but a solid IV at least.<br /><br />Arguably this release probably does rate only 2 stars when compared with other McCartney/Beatles/Wings efforts but it could easily rate 4 stars if not held to such high standards.  Hence, I've decided to give McCartney II a 3+ star rating overall.  What does that signify?  Simply that I do enjoy listening to the tracks on this release individually and as a package when the mood strikes.<br /><br />1. Coming Up should be familiar enough to most McCartney fans as this is the studio version of the track that received radio airplay and had the amusing \\"multi-McCartney\\" video on MTV.<br />2. Temporary Secretary can be amusing or it can be annoying.  I've had many people tell me that it is the latter but I consider it to be the former (in a Devo sort of way).<br />3. On The Way is the first track on McCartney II that would have fit well on a Wings album (any of them); one of my favorites.<br />4. Waterfalls is a nice mellow McCartney pop track and is well placed as the succeeding song to On The Way.<br />5. Nobody Knows is a Lo-Fi/Retro rocker that builds into quite a toe-tapper.<br />6. Front Parlour is an interesting keyboard/synthesizer instrumental; nice but non-essential.<br />7. Summer's Day Song is Beatlesque McCartney set to synths; very pleasant.<br />8. Frozen Jap is another keyboard instrumental that is quite catchy; reminiscent of similar upbeat Edgar Froese/Tangerine Dream compositions.<br />9. Bogey Music is psychedelic rockabilly and a lot of fun unless you are in a serious mood (which you probably won't be in at this point assuming that you have just finished listening to the preceding eight tracks).<br />10. Darkroom is in a word ODD; good in a quirky sort of way.<br />11. One Of These Days is a traditional McCartney acoustic ballad; another favorite.<br />12. Check My Machine defies description and I'm really not sure how I feel about this one.  If I let the track get started then I'm hooked which is why I am ALWAYS tempted to press stop or skip first.<br />13. Secret Friend is a hypnotic closer that seems to go on forever ... 10 minutes plus!!!<br />14. Goodnight Tonight is superb and is a true bonus for those buying the updated McCartney II.  I have the original 1987 (Capitol/MPL) McCartney II release so this one is missing from my copy.<br /><br />If your initial listening experience is anything like mine then you will find yourself debating whether or not you like McCartney II track by track.  If so, give it a few additional listenings until you are absolutely sure.3. Secret Friend is a hypnotic closer that seems to go on forever ... 10 minutes plus!!!  14.

B001NLL8LA|3.0|DO Not PreOrder Kindle Books unless you want it badly enough to pay the price listed prior to Kindle publication. I've learned this the hard way.

143915726X|2.0|Jodi Picoult excels at exploring moral and ethical dilemmas and this book was no exception - all the way up until the end where she copped out, and took a huge dump all over the intelligence of her readers.<br /><br />There are very good questions raised in this book and the characters are full of life and reality. You can believe 100% in these characters who behave like real people with real problems. When Ana sues her family for emancipation so that she can control the circumstances under which her sister gets donated tissue from her, you see that there are issues beyond the obvious. Ana is clearly tormented by the decision and by the torment it causes to her parents - especially her mother. The only voice you don't really hear is that of her sister - the child for whom Ana was born. That's a shame but it's to be expected - the book isn't really about her. She's just along for the ride through most of the book.<br /><br />If the novel had ended before, well, the end, I think I'd've given it a four star review. The ending, though, was so bad as to be worth two stars. It was obvious, made up, cheap, and an enormous cop out. At the last minute, Picoult decided to take the easy way out and end with a big cheesy, garbage ending worse than the almost universally despised \\"Hannibal\\" ending.<br /><br />So, here's the upshot: There's a courtroom scene at the end and I think that closing the book as they exit the courtroom will dramatically improve your experience with the book. If you choose to read this book, ending and all, don't say you weren't warned!
B0019EXZY4|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Though its title makes it sound like a generic genre exercise in the tradition of The Italian Job(s), this thriller is actually far more grounded in realism and brutality than you would expect and makes for a surprisingly satisfying motion picture--unformulaic and possessed of a convincing 70s aesthetic, it's a must watch for those interesting in heists.

B000VDDDY6|4.0|The first season of Star Trek is pretty much awesome. It has lots of great episodes on it, and it will rarely disappoint. However, the double sided DVDs are really annoying. They get smudged so easily, and its always the side you need. (Say, if you don't have a HD player, and need the regular DVD side.) But besides that, it's nice. It comes in a little nice box-y case. Also, the remastered-ness is a little distracting. Added new computer generated sequences aren't even that great and seem completely out of place. I personally would prefer the old cheesy special effects. They may be dated, but it gives it that feel of nostalgia.

B001PPGAJE|5.0|Looks and sounds great in high def. Great pop-corn flick and definitely worth adding to your high def movie collection.
B001GKJ2ES|3.0|I expected a lot from this film! Man, you've got Jolie and Freeman and this promising McAvoy. Plus, it is directed by the same man who created Night Watch and Day Watch (two really enjoyable and open-minded urban-fantasy films). This film is disappointing, no matter how hard I try to appreciate its inventions, Matrix-like moves and sensuality that Jolie brings to any movie. Too bad, 'Wanted' is just mediocre when it could've been great a movie.   The story is simple, characters are far from simple (where the hell all these assassins come from?), but the movie focuses on being simple. Main characters are pretty interesting, but these different characters are sacrificed way too easily. Or, maybe it's just the fact that there's no real chemistry between McAvoy and Jolie?! I expected the worst from the start and it doesn't go very far from that. The movie aims for the sequel, that's for sure. I really hope Jolie manages to find a better script, a film that really knocks my brains out. She has all the qualities for doing a film that would be the future's classical action film. This film is not what I wanted.
0060558121|1.0|This is a boring book and not written particularly well. Nothing much happens in this book. I must admit the premise is fantastic, a great idea, but the delivery of the idea was such a let down. All the fantastic mythical stories were there from thousands of years of mythology but I found the manner in which the story was strung together amazingly unimaginative. The book could have been so much more.<br /><br />All of the negative reviews on Amazon seem to touch upon the point that this book is incredibly boring at times. I found it a real struggle to finish. So many clich&eacute;s (\\"he came to a fork in the road\\") and predictable plot elements destroyed the book for me. Buy the book if you like badly written ones, and also if you like a book to be lightly strewn with irrelevant overly-descriptive gratuitous sex scenes. God-porn is something I hadn't heard of before I read this. An absolute burden of a book.

B001HN697M|2.0|From the first poorly done CGI frame, to the very last poorly edited scene, this Blu Ray was a whimpering dog of a flick!  I really enjoyed the first \\"Underworld\\".  Heck, it featured Kate Beckensale in skin tight black leather, so what's not to like??  But, this movie was so poorly edited, scripted, and poorly acted, even the lovely Ms Mitra could not make it watchable.      Do yourself a favor, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.  Even Blu Ray can make this watchable.  The sound was really awful, and the transfer was so poor, the entire experience seemed as though we were watching a VHS tape version.      Please believe me when I tell you this is the kind of experience that will have you writing to the studio with a demand to be compensated for all of the time you wasted watching this excruciatingly horrid flick.
B001FB4W02|2.0|I have to agree with \\"K-Dawg\\" on this one... this season was no where near as good as Season 7.  Frankly, I'm amazed at all the positive reviews.  I'm not commenting on the quality of the Blu-Ray presentation, just the season as a whole.  The \\"Tess Mercer\\" character is easy on the eyes but lacks history with the existing players to make her \\"Lex Luthor\\" like behavior believable. The fact that she strolls into the Kent Home and barn with impunity, or that she always seems to be in the strangest places at the right time (alleyways, cornfields,etc..) is nothing short of maddening, as is her insistence that Clark \\"trust her\\" or \\"come to her when the time is right\\"... why the hell would he do that, she's a stranger?!?  Parts of the storyline seemed glossed over; When exactly did Oliver succeed in killing Lex Luthor?  The Season finale was the most senseless episode of all:  1. Why did Chloe stop Clark from banishing Davis?  2. Why did Tess assume Lois stole the Orb?  3. Why would Clark leave the Leigon's ring in his unlocked desk at work?  I love this show but it's time to wrap it up.  It's becoming as senseless as \\"Heroes\\". It's time for Tom to put on the Superman outfit... He's earned the right to wear it and we loyal viewers have earned the right to see him in it.
0099465655|5.0|By far one of her best. The humor, wit, and story line is excellent. Venetia is an endearing heroine - lovely, strong, romantic, caring, intelligent - all the best qualities one would wish to have in oneself. The romance that unfolds, well....I should let you find out.
B0018CVQFM|3.0|The release of this set, a few months after the introduction of a remastered [[ASIN:B000Y9PILI Songs For Beginners]], mirrors the same path taken for the 2006 David Crosby [[ASIN:B000GUJYAQ Voyage]] set, and the remastered [[ASIN:B000J103N4 If I Could Only Remember My Name]].<br /><br />Both of the remastered solo releases pre-dated the release of each set. However, someone decided not to utilize the superior sound of the solo editions.<br /><br />It's not to say that the audio on both sets is bad, but when A/B'd against the two solo remasters, the dichotomy is stark.<br /><br />This is extremely disappointing, especially since all four releases were compiled at Rhino.  However, ever since Rhino was \\"Warner-i-sized\\", this is the kind of oversight one has come to expect from that once great label.

B001RIY4WE|4.0|I found out nearly a year ago (when I bought my new blu-ray player) that brand new release blu-ray DVDs use the latest technology, which means you have to update your blu-ray player's software (firmware) every month or two.  Aggravating - but a fact you get used to.  If you can't play this DVD, find out how to update your player's firmware.    (By the way, my 4 stars is my rating of the movie itself... not my personal blu-ray problem.)
B001FB55HG|3.0|While giant explosions and wildly intense action scenes are eclipsed by even larger sequences of mass destruction, the story of Terminator Salvation remains timidly simple.  No tricky time travel finds its way into the plot, but perhaps such complexities are exactly what's missing - the loss of interaction between something completely alien and the familiar conventions of our world coupled with the contrast of futuristic terror and the limited resources of present day leave a premise dull by comparison.  Though it may be nearly impossible to match the integrity of the first two entries in the franchise, Salvation should realize that bigger sizes and quantities of killer robots doesn't necessarily make them scarier.<br /><br />The year is 2018 and the war between man and machine rages on.  Skynet continues to build larger and more powerful weapons, including increasingly advanced Terminators.  When the Resistance, led by John Connor (Christian Bale), uncovers a secret code embedded in the enemy's communications, an offensive is planned that may allow a crippling strike to the machines' headquarters.  Teaming up with mysterious stranger Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), Connor must race against time to locate Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and protect the future of mankind.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation is as dark and serious as The Dark Knight, except that there is no Joker - or any character we can follow with white-knuckle enthusiasm. There's little humor to break up the unrelenting suspense and detonative violence, resulting in an entertainingly bleak post-apocalyptic action fest with fleeting genuine fun. The machines are bigger, more destructive and less advanced, but not more terrifying. They aren't the cleverly infiltrated assassins that wowed audiences in the original two films, but lifeless automatons that only present dilemmas when an action sequence requires it. The intelligence and mercilessness of the machines, once admirable when personified by Schwarzenegger, is only matched by the humans in a constant struggle to blur the lines between good and evil; the Resistance in Salvation is unable to avoid becoming like the new enemy.<br /><br />Plenty of extra characters allow for more casualties, battles, carnage, showdowns, firepower, bloodshed (minus the blood) and apathetic adventure - there's little heart to any of it. It is action for the sake of action; stunts and thrilling fight sequences take precedence while the story merely serves to tie them together. It's a fresh setting, grittier and intense from cutting edge camerawork, mind-blowing sound effects and visuals, with interior designs like Aliens and exterior locations like The Road Warrior. But the story doesn't advance any of the characters, nor does it inform us of unfamiliar aspects. By the end, nothing has changed, and all we've witnessed is glorified Terminator and human warfare. It's a giant, unending battle with no hope for solid resolution or events that can change Judgment Day lore - it's an episode that doesn't greatly impact or alter what James Cameron so revolutionarily created.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsatched by the humans in a constant struggle to blur the lines between good and evil; the Resistance in Salvation is unable to avoid becoming like the new enemy.

B000065PUE|4.0|4 1/2    In many ways the definitive early edition indie rock release, Doolittle did so much more than what was to be expected in '89 by a typical four piece rock outfit. But of course fans were already in line after witnessing what Black/Deal aesthetics could wield on a sophomore that, besides a few tracks, remains undeniably essential.
B000G73UEU|5.0|After seeing the DVD \\"I'm Your Man\\", I couldn't live without the soundtrack.  I was unfamiliar w/ the Wainwrights, Antony, the Handsome Family, etc - and now look for them everywhere.  Awesome collection!!
B001RCD2DW|5.0|This pair of headphones is marketed as the studio version of the K701. They are identical, except for the color and the fact that this one has a detachable cable. The reviews for the K701 are all you need. The official price is higher for this one, so be smart and shop around first; buy it only if you can find a third party seller for a price comparable to that of the K701.
0061854549|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and it was a fast page turner for me. Dan does a great job along with all co-authors and editors to make the book accessible yet holds academic value. The tricks and illusions our minds play and lessons learned were mind boggling.    Overall, the book challenged economical critical thinking and widely held beliefs about the rationality of people. It did so in logical and scientific manner. I would reiterate another reviewer point of the lack of breadth of experiments beyond university campus and I would like to see more experiments held in different countries and/or different demographics.    Buy it! It's a great book.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I travel alot and I love to read. The Kindle was my answer to several hardback books in my bag.  However since Amazon   has decided that now they have a following, they can raise their prices from 9.99 to whatever the bookstores are charging, I feel that I can no longer support them.  I had my Kindle 1 stolen, and I could not, not replace it.  Now I am questioning whether this was the right decision. The price of the new Kindle -without the cover that was include before - is not inexpensive, and with their new pricing of books, magazines, papers etc. will I still be able to tell everyone that asks me about the Kindle how much I love it?  I'm worried

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Of course I may love it because of Maureen O'hara, but really it's just the funniest and most fun of all the Duke movies.  A few life lessons for the kids, fun to see some other actors when they were younger, and a great family flick (but my wife let the kids know I would never be allowed to spank her).
0307265730|5.0|I have read all 3 of her books, and think this is by far the best. Her characters are intimately drawn, and echo real people. I loved the book, and would recommend it to anyone.    That being said, I am beginning to tire of her rather stable and predictable cast of characters - the highly educated professional parents who immigrate to the US in the 70s, but somehow never manage to truly assimilate and find happiness in their new milieu and instead, spend their lives perpetually looking back to India; the children, apparently eternally torn between their parents' culture and the country that is their birthplace and their home.    It seems to be a modern conceit that immigrants cannot adjust well and enjoy their new lives, but in reality most of us have. Perhaps books about 'normal' immigrants just can't get published, but I'm definitely ready to see Lahiri's prose put to work on new subjects.
B000069HKH|5.0|I was never really what I would consider a Springsteen fan.  His career started a bit before my 'time' of when I first started listening to music, and while I liked some of his radio-popular hits I never felt the need to buy any of his music.    Until I heard this album while in a friend's car, and was blown away.  Each song just pulled me in, and held me there all the way to the end.  Even after a few years of listening to this album now, I still enjoy every moment of it and find something new in each song when I listen to them.  The songs feel like they are written by somebody REAL, writing and singing about real emotions and problems in life, and it's believable and makes you feel part of his world.    Rock on Bruce - you've made me a fan.
0385340575|5.0|Reacher is back!  And in top form!  This novel was a perfect combination of mysteries within mysteries combined with suspense and action and just didn't quit!<br /><br />It opens with our hero sitting in a New York subway.  Only a few other people are in the car, and one of them, frightenly enough, exactly fits \\"the list.\\"  The list is a bulleted list of tells, or signs, developed by the Israelis, that a person is a suicide bomber.  But why, this woman, in this place -- a subway train in the middle of the night, going to nowhere important?  Could it be a mistake?  Reacher decides that he must approach her.<br /><br />What happens from that moment on is what sets the story, as he begins to find out her history, her motivation, and who else may or may not be involved.<br /><br />This novel represents Mr. Child at his very best.  I hope all his fans read this, and that some other folks give it a try.  You don't have to have read the rest of the books to pick this one up and read.  Enough information is given to you, in a very unobtrusive manner, to enjoy this book.<br /><br />I recommend it 100%!
B001FB55HG|5.0|this film fits logically into the Terminator mythology, everything they told us about post-judgment day and what john connor would be like seemed very natural. the production design, special effects and action scenes are all excellent. the acting and charecters are pretty wooden and thats where the film falters. coming off of the intense characterization of tvs Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, its sorely missed. its not a perfect film but its dark and thrilling and its great to finally see the real war of the machines.
1932100660|5.0|This is without a doubt the best book on nutrition I have ever read.  It is backed up by hard science compiled by the most eminent researchers and academic institutions.  The evidence supporting the benefits of eating a plant based diet is overwhelming.

143915726X|2.0|I was hooked on the story from the beginning.  It was a great premise and Jodi fleshed out the characters very well.  There were great emotional insights, lots of tension - - just what one would expect from family going through something like this. It was a very thought provoking story.....until the end.  BAM! All the emotional ties and tension busted in one chapter.  A five star rating plummeted quickly. Instead of leaving the reader with a moral issue to think about, Jodi wrapped up everything in such a contrived and maudlin manner. Why write such an edgy, morally difficult story if you were going to cave in with such a \\"soap opera\\" style ending?  I was very disappointed.  I would not recommend this book because the emotional buildup and investment is not the worth the ending the author gave us.

B001MEJY8W|4.0|WARNING: Pascal Laugier's film \\"Martyrs\\" is extremely difficult to watch.<br /><br />Not since Gasper Noe's 'Irreversible' (1997) has a viewing experience been so candid and uncompromising in its brutality. That said, \\"Martyrs\\" is definitely one of the best horror films of 2009. With other notable ultra-violent films like High Tension (2005), Them (2006), Inside (2007) and Frontier(s) (2008), the French have been dominating the international horror scene for quite some time and \\"Martyrs\\" is the latest offering in the new era wave of French horror cinema that has undeniably set a new standard for the genre. The problem with these films, however, is that they're such sick cinematic puppies that lavishing too high praise could be misinterpreted by others as tantamount to endorsing necromancy, child abuse, cat-bashing, torture and rape. While \\"Martyrs\\" did remind me of the 'Hostel' films and could quite easily be categorized under the same 'torture-porn' sub-genre of movies, it somehow manages to find itself marked out from the rest due to its challenging and through-provoking subtext. Although I believe Laugier went a little too far with his subject matter (which many will find graphic and taboo), the film, writing, direction, and acting are superb. Unlike a lot of other movies in this genre, \\"Martyrs\\" creates its dread not in its controversial images of the abuse and suffering of individuals (which the 'Hostel' and 'Saw' films were notable for doing) but in the knowing that the people who perpetrate these crimes do so for transcendental reasons: there is an undeniable existential sadness that permeates both the film's plot and visuals. This is where the real terror comes into play. Without revealing too much, \\"Martyrs\\" (as the title suggests) has a sense of philosophy that elevates it into a league of its own dealing with interesting notions of human nature, life after death, and the will to survive. Definitely not for everyone, this film has a very powerful premise that will have most people reeling long after they've seen it.<br /><br />*It's interesting to note that the people behind these crimes are often portrayed as the stuffy old Vaudeville types who drive around in European cars and congregate in large mansions in the middle of now where.l have most people reeling long after they've seen it.    *It's interesting to note that the people behind these crimes are often portrayed as the stuffy old Vaudeville types who drive around in European cars and congregate in large mansions in the middle of now where.
0767903862|5.0|During several lunches, I laughed so hard I snorted salsa up my nose (twice) and diet coke (once).  Not only is it descriptive and informative, it's funny as heck!  Sometimes you're tooling along reading it and suddenly, out of no where, a single sentence or turn of phrase sneaks up and bites you in the butt!  Great read!  Enjoyed it immensely!
B001TW69J4|5.0|I'm going to start this off by saying that I didn't have a clue what I was getting into when I got this album. I was just going off the advice of a friend to \\"just buy, don't think\\", and I had only heard a couple songs posted on their MySpace that I wasn't really even all that crazy about. What a great gamble that turned out to be. This album quickly made me forget that I even had expectations, and it has already become one of my all-time favorite albums, despite only having it for a little over 2 weeks. I'm dead serious.    \\"Animals as Leaders\\" is leaded by guitarist/songwriter Tosin Abasi (ex-Reflux), and is the first progressive metal band I've heard that really can't be put into a genre. Even \\"progressive metal\\" is a label that would make people think they're going to sound like Dream Theater or Rush, which is absolutely not the case. \\"Experimental\\" might be a good label, but that's also a bad, terrible label, in that it simply clumps together all the musicians who sound nothing like anybody else or each other. This album is fresh, it's instrumental, it's heavy, it's very progressive (both rhythmically and melodically), it's uplifting, it's EPIC, and it's utterly beautiful. No need to genre-ify it.    Anyways, there is nothing more important to this album than the musicianship of Tosin Abasi. I'm no guitarist, but I can easily say that he makes his music come alive with passion and heart, and I'm worried that his guitars might explode if he keeps making such awesome music. The drum work is phenomenal, too. I've been playing drums for 11 years, and some of the stuff I hear is like nothing I've ever heard. I just wish I knew who wrote/played them (may have been Tosin for all I know, some multi-instrumentalists are skilled at everything).    The two tracks currently posted on MySpace \\"Tempting Time\\" and \\"Song of Solomon\\", are good examples of the heavier side of the album. While those are damn good songs that will make you rock out no matter where or how you listento them, they're not my favorites - those would have to be the more laid-back tunes with the jazzier-classical influences, like \\"Soraya\\", \\"Behaving Badly\\" and \\"The Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing\\". Hearing an atmospheric jazz-fusion-esque sound combined with redonkulous 5/16 time, meshuggah-like polyrhythms, and a classical guitar-like composition is the coolest thing in the world! Though, even the songs I didn't mention are absolutely amazing! I just haven't had enough time with the album yet to develop a sense of how to describe them (it's that way with most of the album, actually). I'll just let you find out for yourself what it sounds like.    However, don't get the idea that just because I mentioned which ones are my favorites, that there are songs or parts of songs that are just OK or filler! There is not a single wasted second on this album. There is nothing repetitive, nothing that will bore you, nothing that will leave you disappointed or underwhelmed, nothing that will even make you think about skipping to the next track. This is an album that after your first listen, will leave you feeling as though you've rediscovered music. It was good enough that it's been in my car's CD player for the last couple weeks straight, and I haven't gotten tired of it. I can't say the same for the new Mastodon, the new Isis, or the new Obscura, which I thought were all great albums that really pushed the limits of metal. Will I call this the best metal album of 2009? Absolutely, and possibly the best metal album of the last few years (right up there with the latest Meshuggah, Opeth and Gojira albums, and a few other other great bands that thrive on how original they can be).    People, get this album. A smart man once said \\"What mama don't know can't hurt her\\", but he's obviously never heard Animals as Leaders before. Buy it now, you won't make a better decision for a long time.

B000002UA7|3.0|As an introduction to Kate Bush, THE WHOLE STORY offers solid song list from the early stages of her career (I know, I know, no anthology is perfect, and clocking in at just under forty-nine minutes, the disc obviously has room for much more). It's a shame, however, that EMI has offered such a no-frills presentation of this material. The sound lacks the warmth one would expect from a more contemporary mastering (the disc still has the analog mix and does not exploit the possibilities of the CD format), and rather than a fact-filled booklet, the album jewel case contains only a folded blow-in sheet that contains no liner notes at all. One would expect EMI to showcase this Kate Bush primer with more care, at least directing new listeners to more of her work. The songs get a five, the package gets a one, and the average is three.
B001RIY49C|3.0|This review is for the Collectors set with skull.  The skull is very solid, well made and will look great on your shelf.  It comes with batteries and there's also a on/off switch underneath the base.  The eyes light up and it plays sound effects from the movie.  The sound is terrible though, it just sounds like static noise.  The discs come in a separate case and you can also store them in the base of the skull.  The blue-ray disc is a pain and wouldn't register my internet connection and takes forever to load.  DTS and 5.1 sound wouldn't work on blue-ray for some reason.  The sound on the DVD versions worked great so it must be a blue-ray defect.  I'm pleased with the set except for the sound problems.  If you're a fan this might be worth picking up but it's far from perfect.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|This show, although fun and compelling for my first viewing has absolutely no staying power. It's essentially a dressed up well done soap opera. Many shows today suffer from this new format that suck (no pun intended) a viewer in and drag us through but leave us with little else for the experience.<br /><br />I can dig out DVDs of M*A*S*H*, Star Trek, Little House on the Prairie, or even Giligan's Island and find a favorite episode or two or 10 to get me re-engaged all over again, almost like with a good film. Still, for all that season 1 of True Blood was it was not something i will feel compelled to put on again.<br /><br />There was also a level of hokeyness that i did not expect. I was told, and was hoping for 6 feet Under or American Beauty with Vampires. I was hoping for tip top acting and writing and a show that was mature and intelligent. All i wound up with was 12 episodes of a soft core vampire soap opera.<br /><br />6 Feet Under stands out as a great HBO drama that has staying power. I have favorite episodes and own and love that series. Baring some unforeseen change in this shows format and writing I doubt this show will grow much. There is a Dukes of Hazzard silliness to this that I was not expecting and was disappointed by.<br /><br />I will say that i did enjoy it enough to see it through to it's end, or finale. Similarly to Heroes and LOST there is an element that is lacking here that great films and great TV have. Showing Anna Paquin and many other girls naked in free for all vamp sex does not a good show make. I imagine that many viewers are inthralled by the frankness of the sex but it's still not great drama and certainly not worth re-watching even like an old episode of Kink of Queens is.

0061474339|5.0|Abhorsen wraps everything together in an intricate and intelligent weave.  Questions and problems you may have encountered in Lirael, are resolved warmly throughout this novel.  I was extremely impressed by the amount of creativity it took Garth Nix to pour into this series.  He is a very underrated author of our time, and Old Kingdom series is among my favorite.  I won't reveal much about this book, but I will say it was better and shorter than Lirael.  And you will be satisfied at the end of it.  The book is really character-driven, which I love and you will love.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this series I would reccomend his other books.  Shade's children is a great one-shot novel that no Garth Nix reader shouldn't read.  Also the Seventh tower still remains my favorite work of him.  Trust me it may be toned down for a younger audience, but I enjoyed the 7 books fully as an adult.
B000KKPN5C|2.0|For the record, this review is been submitted on August 20 2009, so I hope the review date is not changed!    I bought this little flash and since the first day I fell in love with it.     Pros: Very practical, much faster recharge time than the built-in camera flasha and covers more surface area. Uses only two AA batteries that last a long time.   It has bounce flash, although it does not seem like it, the front light bulb swivels up to 90 degrees on a smooth even rotation.   The flash is very well built, it does not seem cheap plastic at all, very solid.   Works very well on Nikon D40, 50, 60,70, 80 and many others, but not older systems.       Cons: It will not work on a Nikon D1H, D2H.   Watch out for grey market, the flash I have is not authentic USA brand.     How do I know the flash is not authentic USA Nikon?     Well, when I bought it right away I filled out the warranty card, everything seems legit,but notice there was no numbers anywhere on the box or on the warranty card. It was filled out and sent to Nikon, after that I did not hear from them and they care less for such a discrepancy, nowadays quality control is not the same.     So, anyway back to the subject, I decide to call because there was one lens I had a question with, Nikon 85mm 1.8, that I bought recently and on the meantime decided to personally check with the Nikon representative about all my Nikon products, turned out the flash is grey market. Unfortunately when I did this more than a month passed by and Amazon could not help me. Contact the company who sold me the flash thru Amazon and they hang the phone on me.     Just word of advice, grab the phone and call Nikon USA and check the serial number on your flash. I found out the hard way the flash serial number came back with results of a Nikon D40 kit. Nikon USA clearly stated they will not repair the flash if it breaks, so far is working fine, but I paid the extra money for USA warranty products, if I would have known I might as well bought it on EBAY international brand which are much cheaper.     I got burned on this one, this is what really happened, I hope Amazon posts this review and does not look the other way, others must be warned to prevent incidents like this and protect the customer.     It would have been five stars, but the warranty issue was a major dissapointment.  Thank you       IF Amazon has any questions please feel free to contact me as I got proof of all I have said above.
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris did an excellent job meshing together humor and anecdotes to create a book that both powerfully funny and unendingly creative. Whether his life was really this adventurous is up to interpretation, but even if they are all lies, they're average enough to believe.   There are multiple aspects of the book that make it a page-turners dream. Its \\"interesting essay\\" breakup, excessive use of humor, and imaginative characters all up to one grand book.   The essay format I'm talking about is Sedaris's usual prose. He breaks up his interesting life into succinct chapters that are actuallly standalone essays that seem to casually flow together, except for where the author purposely leave out content to make you guess or feel different than if you knew all of the innards of the situation, such as the first few times Hugh is mentioned.   Hugh is one of the many interesting and hilarious characters that have surrounded Sedaris through his life. I won't go into the characters and their personal quirks due to the spoilers, but trust they are not a boring bunch.   So, Sedaris's semi-autobiography is full of laughs, laughs, and, uh, laughs. I'd recommend reading the second or thrid chapter. If you like it, you'll love the book, if you don't, this may not be for you. Just grab your funny bones and be prepared to stay up all night. This is one book you won't want to miss, unless you like your world unfunny that is.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|This is a fabulous movie with stellar performances.  Meryl Streep really nails the priggish, intolerant nun/principal part while Hoffman is terrific as the charismatic but slightly dodgy priest. Did he or didn't he?????  A timeless story and a great ending.  You'll be thinking about this movie for days afterwards.
020530902X|4.0|This is an admirable book, if you want to write like the authors; it is a good book as far as it goes, but does it go far enough? Well, you will find salutary advice to resuscitate your prose, but if you want to be a fine craftsman--that is, if you don't want to beget base prose, you mustn't hang with Trunk and White for too long.

B001IZFXMQ|3.0|I kinda thought this was supposed to be funny.  It is here and there but for the most part it's a straight faced telling of the zombie war.  The idea seems funny, but loses its charm after a while.  Not that its boring, just not super entertaining.

B00005JNJV|1.0|I don't know why they called this movie Batman. Maybe it should have been called Ninja man. This is not any Batman I know or would want to know.  The plot and character development of this film are sorely lacking even for a comic based character- as it relies entirely on non- stop action.  I enjoyed action films when Arnold was the big star of the time, but Batman Begins lacks any real excitement and is incredibly over-serious and lacking in humour.       Christian Bale lacks any personality as Batman. Michael Keaton was infinitely superior.  Bale has no sense of humour, is anything but handsome or physically imposing and someone who is certainly not suited for any leading role other than American Psycho.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I absolutely adore this sitcom.  All the actors are great and I have a hard time trying to pick a favorite one!  This sitcom is different than any other and has a smart, comedic twist.  You can actually learn something from watching it, unlike the other brain dead shows that are currently out there.  I highly recommend everyone to watch this show.  I can't wait for season 2 to be released!
B000MNP2KI|1.0|What the hell is this?  This movie does not resemble any James Bond I know.  It is painful to watch as it is overly serious and sorely lacking in any sense of excitement, personality or fun.    Daniel Craig has no sense of suaveness, sarcasm or humour and physically more closely resembles Dumbo than James Bond.  He is by far the worst James Bond ever.  0 stars!
B000FIMG68|4.0|With the hatch no longer a mystery, the writers had to come up with some new form of suspense so we discover there are other survivors from the tailend of Oceanic 815, henceforward known as \\"Tailies,\\" led by the indominatable Ana Lucia, who Jack had recalled meeting at the airport bar near the end of last season, and one tough dude in Mr. Eko.  It seems they couldn't generate much with Desmond Hume other than a suspenseful intro into the season with Locke, Kate and Jack down in the hatch, leaving with nothing more than a \\"so long, brother,\\" as if the island is doomed to oblivion.<br /><br />For the first half of the season, the Tailies carry the action, having captured Michael, Sawyer and Jin after washing back up on the island from their ill-fated attempt to escape the island.  The Tailies are even better than the previous Losties.  In addition to Ana Lucia and Eko, we discover Libby and Bernard and meet a mysterious person in Goodwin.  Not to be forgotten, the writers shift back and forth between the two sides of the island, keeping us apprised of the new situation that has occurred since the Losties found the stash at the former Dharma station, leaving Hurley to guard the food locker. Interesting choice.<br /><br />We are filled in on a number of details, including the special significance of the numbers that cast a powerful grip on Locke.  Of course, Jack can't see what the point of the numbers exercise is but Hurley reminds him, \\"They're bad, dude!\\" or words to that effect.  Hurley is featured in an excellent episode, \\"Dave,\\" which really shows the kind of situation drama that can be generated from a show like this.  But, unfortunately for Team Jack, it is Team Ana that steals the show in Season Two.<br /><br />Around Episode 8 or so the two sections of the plane reunite in a stunning scene.  You figure sparks are really going to fly.  After all, how many leaders can you have on such a small island, but things become surprisingly tepid.  The writers appear content to tread water until Danielle discovers an odd little man in one of her traps and so we are introduced to Henry Gale, who claims to have fallen to the island from a balloon.<br /><br />This leads to an astonishing number of discoveries on the island.  Michael (one of my least favorite characters) returns after his search for Walt, demanding that a select few of the Losties join him in the continued pursuit of his son, resulting in a shocking final three episodes that pretty much read as one entity.  Abrams and co. really know how to come up with a gripping season finale.<br /><br />On the whole, I would say this is the best season of the series.  It was certainly the most compelling, as it introduced strong new characters and extended the storylines in interesting new ways.  One tires of some of the characters but that is to be expected when you have such a large ensemble cast.il Danielle discovers an odd little man in one of her traps and so we are introduced to Henry Gale, who claims to have fallen to the island from a balloon.

B0018CWEYY|3.0|This has to be the most disappointing season thus far.  A show that started out with such promise and managed to sustain a good head of steam through three seasons, bottoms out in season four.<br /><br />I suppose the screenwriters' strike had a lot to do with it.  They could only manage 14 episodes in the truncated season, and tried to make the best of it by giving you one out of the frying pan and into the fire scene after another.  Despite the clever use of \\"flashforwards\\" to move between the island and the mainland, the writers seemed lost as to where to take this series, relying way too much on Locke to carry the action when it just wasn't in his character to be a leader.  Jack, of course, rises to the occasion, and Sawyer has his moments.  However, as Ben turns the ancient wheel toward a new season, we know that the Oceanic 6 still hasn't left the island behind them.<br /><br />You just have to wonder how much this series has left in it.  Season Five has hardly been the most fulfilling entertainment either.  One hopes that when the time comes to finally put the lid on this series that the writers will find a way to resolve the many loose threads they now have dangling, after having introduced so many characters and so many overlapping storylines.  Nevertheless, it was good while it lasted.

B00004TJKI|5.0|I love this movie.  James Stewart is a favorite actor of mine.  I bought the movie to use in my junior English classroom after we studied TWELVE ANGRY MEN.  I prepared questions based on the movie.
B001FB55HG|3.0|What is this movie trying to do? I understand the concept, both as a separate entity and as a piece of the narrative puzzle started by James Cameron back in 1984. But really, what is \\"Terminator Salvation\\" all about? Is it genuinely trying to expand on a very well established story, or is it delivering the exact same product in a visually stunning new package? You'd think watching a movie about events that have already been explained would be a lot of fun, but somehow, it feels incredibly tedious. Maybe that's why it never seemed like it was getting to the point, and I'm hard pressed to say that there even was a point to get to. Whereas the original \\"Terminator\\" films were driven by clever, carefully constructed plots, this new film seems almost entirely driven by mindless action. This would be fine for the average summer blockbuster, but when you're talking about continuing a richly developed science fiction fable, there needs to be something more.    The story takes place after Judgment Day in the year 2018, a time when the super intelligent machines designed by Skynet have taken over the world. Entire cities lie in ruins. Governments have collapsed. Much of humanity has been ... well, terminated. Many of those that survived have banded together to form The Resistance, which includes a grown up John Conner (Christian Bale), who has been prophesized to end the war between humans and machines. As he listens to a series of cassette tapes recorded by his late mother, he's made aware that he must seek out and protect his father, Kyle Reese. You will recall that John was conceived when Kyle travelled back to the 1980s to protect Sarah Conner from a Terminator machine. Within the context of \\"Terminator Salvation,\\" Kyle is younger than his own son--a teenager (Anton Yelchin) who travels around with a mute little girl named Star (Jadagrace).    It seems that Skynet is rounding up a number of survivors and taking them to their headquarters near San Francisco. Knowing that Kyle is among them, John insists on a search-and-rescue operation. His commander, the stubborn General Ashdown (Michael Ironside), refuses to let that happen--the way he sees it, human lives are not as important as destroying Skynet once and for all. This puts John in a very uncomfortable position, not only because he has to leave his pregnant wife, Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), but also because he has to trust someone he may be incapable of trusting.    This, I understand, is made strictly for entertainment purposes. And yet, for an inherently entertaining premise, I was surprised at how boring the film ended up being. There are, for instance, virtually no interesting characters. This unfortunately goes double for John Conner; since we already know him and what his mission in life is, I found it very hard to look past the cliché image of the troubled hero. Not even the explosions--and there are many of them--are enough to pique interest, probably because audiences have come to expect them from movies like this. But isn't it always better when the special effects work with the story and not in spite of it? This film, like so many that have come before it, is more concerned with the way it looks than it is with how it plays.    There is, in fact, only one plot point that held my interest, and fortunately, it coincides with the film's only interesting character. I'm referring to Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a former convicted felon. In spite of what the ads for this movie give away, I'll spare you a detailed description of him in the hope that you'll end up being surprised. I will tell you that his very being poses fascinating questions about what really makes us human. He also has a few great scenes. One is at the very beginning with Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), who isn't as clear-cut a character as you might think. The others involve a Resistance fighter named Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood), tough on the outside but not altogether incapable of caring.The rest of \\"Terminator Salvation,\\" alas, is comprised of vehicle chases and shootouts and things blowing up and more chases. Its basic shot consists of a rusty-looking Terminator skeleton being shot in the head, and the camera lingers for a moment to let us watch its glowing red eyes fade to black. Extra time is also reserved for references to the old films, including the lines \\"Come with me if you want to live,\\" and \\"I'll be back.\\" (\\"Hasta la vista, baby,\\" strangely enough, is left out.) Even the ending tips its hat at its predecessors, taking place in a factory.    As for Christian Bale, he proves once again that he's a glutton for punishment, his role so physically demanding, his American accent so meticulously impersonated, his personality so distant and brooding. I think I've gotten tired of watching Bale play such dreary characters. Honestly, can't someone cast him in a comedy? He's a good actor--I'm sure he can be funny. Here, he's just giving us more of the same. His rendition of John Conner may in fact be more robotic than anything done by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Of course, since the story isn't in the least bit interesting, it doesn't allow for the development of any character. So it may be a moot point. \\"Terminator Salvation\\" is very likely to appeal to the fans of the film series, and if you happen to be one of them, then I'm sorry. For my money, this movie played like a listless and generic visual aid for special effects and stunts.
1603090002|4.0|THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, Alan Moore & Kevin O'Neill's motley crew of Victorian-era literary figures, returns for a fourth outing, and the results are extraordinary, indeed.<br /><br /> The first in a trilogy, CENTURY: 1910 sees an modified League, consisting of Mina Murray, Allan Quatermain (Masquerading as his own son, thanks to his newly immortal condition, as seen in THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN: THE BLACK DOSSIER), Carnacki, Raffles, and Orlando, dispatched by Mycroft Holmes to prevent the apocalyptic vision received by Carnacki from becoming a reality. To say more about the story would do potential readers a disservice. (I will say that the story involves Captain Nemo and his equally hardcase Daughter Janni, the Ripper murders, Aleister Crowley, and Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's musical THE THREEPENNY OPERA. An odd, but pleasing, mixture.)<br /><br /> The misgivings I had at the end of Volume II of LOEG still hold true, to an extent: Without the depraved personalities of Hyde, Griffin, and Nemo, the remaining members of The League are less than interesting. Mina and Allan are as boring as ever, and Raffles and Carnacki are not much better. Only Orlando delivers even a fraction of the personality that's been missing since Hyde and Griffin exited Moore's grand stage. However, the \\"new\\" characters (New to More's playground, at least- Jenny Diver, Jack MacHeath, Suki Tawdry, Oliver Haddo, and Norton, the \\"Prisoner of London\\") make for some interesting moments, and O'Neill's art is as grotesquely lovely and detailed as ever. The League itself, as always, is more of a group of passive observers than active participants- They seem very ineffective for such a highly-regarded team. However, I enjoyed the book immensely, and I wish there wasn't going to be the inevitable years-long wait before the next chapter. (Just as an aside, Moore, as usual, doesn't completely play fair with the reader, having a very important section of the book, Nemo's dialogue with his daughter, written in a completely untranslated foreign language. Jess Nevin's annotations for CENTURY: 1910 provide a complete translation, as well as invaluable background information that make the reading experience much more pleasurable for people who are not steeped in Victorian literature. The annotations for CENTURY:1910 are easily found online through a Google search, and are well worth hunting down.)
0307266303|5.0|I'm an avid runner and I bite almost everytime a new book comes out about the ultradistance. Unfortunately most of these books are humdrum accounts of a runner's life of racing which I guess is probably exciting until you've read 50 of the same thing (the sacrifice, the pain, the halucinations..) Born to Run is different. If I could sum up my excitement about distance running I would hand someone this book because McDougall gets it. He understand that ultrarunning is more than just running adnauseum, more than just stunts, and more than just a crazy hobby.   I got busy recommending this book to everyone around me when I was less than half finished with it. I would read a chapter and want to make a copy to show someone but then after the next chapter realize I would be busy copying all day (I didn't do it, copyright police!). Instead I went around cornering people (runners and non-runners alike) to tell them something new I'd read in this book. I learned so much about everything from fixing my running style to hunting down African animals empty handed!    I can't say enough about this book and I wish I could halfway emulate McDougall's excitement about running which flows through every sentence. He's literally saved my running life with this book.
B000MV90IU|5.0|A classic.  The plot slows at times, but has the greatest car chase ever filmed, and a great ending.  A great story, well told.
B001XJEKGC|4.0|I saw the show on the 25th (monday) and i thought it was a GREAT show. I saw Clapton a couple months later at PNC and i thought he played a bit better that night (it was kindof epic) BUT this is still an excellent show. i love these boys and it was so great to see them together (i've seen winwood solo 5 times and clapton twice). i've been to tons of concerts in my life and this one definitely ranks high on my list of the greatest! recommend this dvd for fans of either or both artists. ONE question thought. DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHICH NIGHT (25TH, 25TH OR 28TH) THESE PERFORMANCES ARE FROM?? I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THIS INFO ANYWHERE!

B000LXHK2C|5.0|Just a beautiful work of art.  Music score is wonderful.  Takes me back to a less hectic paced world where the internet is not the main form of socialization.  I wish this would come out in high def.  The scenery alone is worth watching this movie.  It is fabulous.  It's a pleasure just to travel through the vineyard in south France (where the film was made).  Share this experience with your significant other.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|Clapton And Winwood have just dropped a forty year Time Bomb on the Baby Boom Generation with this release. Soul Psychedelisizing, Electrifying, Riveting performances...Very Special! What a great Mix of tunes...Awesome tributes to many of the greats who have left us...Ray, Buddy and Jimi to name a few. WOW! Absolutely incredible Sound and Video...I was very lucky to have seen Blind Faith 'Live' at the old Olympia Stadium in Detroit, Michigan during the Summer of 69, when I was in my youth. You won't want to miss this Dynamic Duos show if they should appear in<br />your town someday as they continue to tour. I have never seen Winwood and Clapton having so much fun! Great Stuff...Get it!
0061124265|2.0|When I ordered this book, I specifically looked for a used book seller on the west coast, where I live, for the ability to receive the book timely.  It took me TWO WEEKS to receive the book from one state over!  I ordered a book in \\"good\\" condition and it arrived with the spine almost falling out.  Not good condition at all, as compared to previously ordered books from other vendors.    I will look elsewhere for my used books in the future.
B001TODCII|5.0|TAKEN is a movie only marginally enjoyed by critics (57% at Rotten Tomatoes) but loved by the American public. Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, a retired government employee who has moved to California to be closer to his daughter Kim, played by Lost's Maggie Grace. Bryan is hesitant when Kim says she is going on a trip to Europe with her friends, but agrees to let her go if she promises to call. Kim does call from Paris, and while she does, Kim witnesses her friend Amanda being kidnapped. Suddenly, Bryan isn't retired anymore. He goes into \\"government employee mode\\" and tells Kim that she is going to be kidnapped and that he will come and save her.<br /><br />While working for the government, Bryan was a \\"preventer.\\" He prevented bad things from happening. You get a picture of what those skills were when he begans encountering and dispatching with thugs easily in France. The action is fast paced and brutal, but not overly gory since this is a PG-13 movie.<br /><br />Bryan's CIA friends tell him he only has 96 hours to save his daughter. Neeson effortly displays the passion and desperation of a father about to lose his daughter. The villians are solid, and Maggie Grace is good as Kim.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and believe it did so well at the theaters because it is about a father saving his daughter. It is about good versus evil. There is no gray area, if you are bad, you are killed by Bryan Mills, angry father and killing machine. There's no message in the film about the environment or terrorism or anything else that many big movies try to slip in to appease the critics. It's a simple movie where you know right away that all the bad guys deserve to die and you'll feel good when they do.
6301095294|1.0|The quality of the VHS release is far superior to the DVD available in 2009. The DVD is washed out. The VHS has much better color and image-focus.    The content? For me, this movie can be watched many more times than Help or Hard Days Night. Listening to the entire audio is fun too.
B000BNTM2I|5.0|I'm just going straight to the heart for this one....<br /><br /> Tonight, I watched Green Day's live DVD called \\"Bullet In A Bible\\"  ..  The effect that this had on me was absolutely profound...  I don't know how to explain it... they played in front of 65,000 people for two nights, totaling 130,000 people...  The reason this DVD made me feel the way it did, was because of the connection Green Day has to their audience...<br /><br />  I don't know if i'm just more sensitive than people, or if everyone can feel this,  but when watching this DVD,  I felt, like i was 65,000 people...  I felt like I had the heart and energy and soul of 65,000 people...  The connection, that this band fosters amongst their audience, and between themselves as well, has got to be one of the most amazing examples of hapiness, love, fun, pain, and beauty that I have ever seen..<br /><br />  If you haven't seen this DVD,  I would recomend it to you...  i'd reccomend it to goldfish who can't remember 3 seconds into their past, I can guarantee if you brought a goldfish to a Green Day concert it would transform into some type of super dolphin that could talk and thank you for bringing it there...  mark my words...  (don't mark my words,  it's just an example of the power and unbeliveable love and personal connection they share when they're up there playing their music..)  The reason this DVD has touched me the way it has, is because I saw myself up on that stage the whole time, connecting the way Billy Joe did...  I was him...  and I know that I can do what I just witnessed him doing...  I am that...  I pray I have the audience to demonstrate this one day...<br /><br />  It's not the music that moved me, so much as the members and the way they connect to everyone there...  Billy Joe,  Tre Cool, and Mike Dirnt...  I've never felt anything like it...<br /><br />  I am going to see them on Tuesday, July 28th, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York City...  both shows, are sold out...  but if you can get tickets..  I don't care if you've never even heard of them/don't like them...  I promise you,  you will leave feeling better than you did coming into the show..  a whole lot better..  there's something amazing that happens at a Green Day concert that goes much deeper than just playing music...<br /><br />  -Christopheran get tickets..  I don't care if you've never even heard of them/don't like them...

I use to believe that the millionaires were those how expend a lot of money. Now I have recognize how really is the millionaire and how can I built my way to become one of them.
B001TI9N7I|4.0|This mystery thriller is NOT your run-of-the-mill who-done-it and I doubt it was intended to be. The story has many levels and story lines and will keep you guessing all the way to the end which does not conclude at one point and stretches the ending of each story over the last 100 pages, making it utterly satisfying.<br />The characters are wonderfully developed and the plot intertwined and complex. YOU WILL NOT GUESS THE ENDING. Guaranteed!!!<br />Highly recommended for those of you who take offense when reading the oversimplified thrillers around.
B001HYX3IY|4.0|I'm surprised that the majority of this book wasn't about examples of how guns, germs and steel have driven the course of history, but rather that it spends the majority of time explaining how particular areas of the world developed agriculture.  I was disappointed.

B00006AUIG|3.0|I found this movie a bit confusing at times...maybe the way it jumps to and from when he listens to the tapes...but knowing that it was set in a REAL once upon a time actual Asylum makes this movie all the more scary.
1416562605|2.0|Someone in my book group picked this book for our monthly read.  Had it not been 'required reading' I would have gladly put it down around page 50.  I learned something about my taste in books from this one.  If I don't like the protagonist the book isn't worth reading.  I don't get the hype around this one.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|All Leonard Cohen fans will thoroughly enjoy this DVD.  I have collected many of his CDs, but never saw a performance.  The man is a magnificent talent and he knows how to share the sportlight and the bows with his other band members.  It is a memorable experience.  At his age, his smile, actions, and the romps off stage delighted me.  A wonderful man.
B001HN69AE|1.0|Everything in this movie is RUSHED RUSHED RUSHED!!!     All the characters are REDUCED to stereotyical americanized cliches!   Goku is a emo whiner and trade the Ki blast of light energy for airbending puffs of smoke.  Bulma is a gung-ho type that screams Lara Croft.  Roshi turned less of his usual perverted self into more bashful.  Yamcha is a surfer dude like moron.    And Piccolo is a Star wars Sith!  Oozaru is 8ft instead of 80ft!! (I walked out of the theater angry because of that)  And all the actors reek!    The fighting is sloppy. The writing is garbage. The Directing is beyond terrible.  There are many rip-offs (Spiderman,Star Wars,Avatar TLA,Matrix)  This has the name Dragonball on it but don't expect anything of the sort! It's a DISCRACE!!! Who ever gives 5 stars likes cheesy crappy movies.    AVOID THIS FILM at all costs it's a big waste of money!!!!!
0060254920|5.0|This is a great classic children's book.  It is a fun and imaginative story about a little boy, Max, that gets into trouble and has to got to bed without his supper.  He then starts to image that his room is turning into a forest and that a boat appears.  He sails off to where the wild things are and becomes their King.  Despite having lots of fun with them he longs for being back home where he is loved and starts to smell good food in the distance.  So he sails back toward the smell, back home and awakes to find that his mother has left his supper in his room for him.  And it is still warm.    The only negatives I have are that many of the sentences ran on too long from one page to the next and that too many of the pages had no text at all.  When reading this story to my 4 year old I always just make up my own text to go with the pictures only pages.  But since this is an award winning book I am sure that those items are just a person taste thing with me and not a problem for most people.
B000H7J9R6|5.0|I got this movie in Blu-Ray- super quality. Jennifer Connely is hot as always. She's hot, because she's got Heart, and she's beautiful. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the acting and the Blu Ray High Def.
0812968255|5.0|Reading this volume, one is often reminded of the aphorisms of Nietzsche and Cioran,particularly in this translation by Gregory Hays that retains the author's spark and humor, a brand of wit that was lost in earlier and more churchly translations. Unlike the sickly and often gloomy modern counterparts referenced, however, Marcus Aurelius was a general of Rome, and thus his attitude towards the nothingness he recognizes is not defeatist but upright, not rebellious but dignified, not scathing but almost tender, not condescending but humble. The meditations of Marcus Aurelius anticipate existentialism, but rather than invite the individual to define particular values, the Roman recommends justice, discipline, efficiency, simplicity, elegance, courage, as absolute virtues, despite (or because of) his acceptance of the emptiness all around, even of such noble absolutes.
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|I liked this movie, but I was a little disappointed after watching it because it's not nearly as good as \\"Casino Royale.\\"  However, I have already watched it twice at the movies & twice since it's been on DVD, so it's not bad to me obviously.
0316044695|5.0|We all think we have it tough at times but this story puts our issues into perspective.  These are exactly the men we want to defend us and we must remember they are out there right now doing thier jobs as your reading this.  There are so many life lessons in this book delivered in a \\"matter of fact\\" style that young and old alike can digest them easily.  This is a must read for any student of life.
B00110K62U|5.0|The DVD version of the Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Dream Cast performance at the Albert Hall, is a MUST, even if you already have the taped version.  The DVD enables direct access to favorite numbers with the optional display of the lyrics as sung.  The DVD also provides a detailed listing for fast acces. The DVD set also contains an excellent  bonus feature on the making of Les Miserables.

B000I2IT44|5.0|This is a great concert by an exceptional band. I love these guys, and I'm sure that's making my review a bit bias.<br /><br />Porcupine Tree is not the band for people that like a \\"stage show\\" (guys running all over the stage, crazy lights, etc.). They are a band for people that like the music. This delivers that in a big way.<br /><br />I would have liked to have all the concert footage on one disc (the two bonus songs are great). That's my only complaint.
B001GCUNYO|1.0|[[ASIN:B001GCUNYO Taken [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />While this movie is AWESOME, the blu-ray's quality is really bad, especially in low light scenes, like the car chases, it looks very \\"pixeled out\\", kinda makes you want to stop watching the movie ... This happens in like 40-50% of the movie.<br /><br />Still ... this movie is so awesome that I'm watching it for the 2nd time right now ... but I would've bought the DVD if i had known the blu-ray had such bad quality.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I have been a Queen/Freddie fan for the longest time.  I own their entire discography/concerts, interviews..etc.  In my opinion this is Freddie in his finest form.  His sheer energy is a delight to watch and food for the Queen lovers soul.  A must have in every fan's library of Queen memorablia.  My only gripe?  Yes, there is one.  I wish it was available in Blu-ray.  Overall, excellent from One Vision to outtakes of the previously unreleased footage of the Friday concert!!!
B001NLL8LA|1.0|I absolutely LOVE my Kindle 2.  I love Jack Reacher.  I do not love paying more than the $9.99 price promised for Kindle books.  It's not the money, it's the principle.  I can read other books until the price drops or the hardcover is available at Barnes and Noble on the marked down shelf for $5.00.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|This concert is excellent.  Clear picture.  Amazing sound.  A true Queen masterpiece to watch over and over again. It is like you are transported back to the 1981 concert in the front row watching Freddie give yet another stellar performance.
B001AQO3WY|4.0|Enjoyed this series a lot. I don't have much to say that others haven't already said. Not having any military experience, I can't vouch for how authentic this portrayal is, but if it's not, they did a damn good job making it look like it. This is how I would imagine it is. If you're interested in the military or the conflict in the Middle East and would like an entertaining portrayal of what our Marines go through on a day to day basis over there, I highly recommend watching these.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|The dvd arrived withing a few days of ordering it. It arrived in excellent condition. I was happy with  the service. We're planning a trip to Australia and even though it was set in a different time period the landscape was amazing and the story line was riviting.
0446691437|5.0|Steven Pressfield has written a little gem of a book on how to overcome the paralyzing fear of failure, primarily for artists and writers, but applicable to anyone who has delayed or abandoned following their dreams. A no-nonsense, stream-of-consciousness style adds to the books' immediacy. A valued addition to my library.
B000002I4W|5.0|Ornette Coleman was 29 years of age in 1959. He had made his debut album in 1958, entitled 'Something Else!!!!,' released on the Contemporary label. Coleman released two other albums for the Contemporary label before leaving to sign with Atlantic Records.    The result was 'The Shape of Jazz to Come,' his first album to be released on the label and to this day, his finest. Produced by Atlantic Records executive Nesuhi Ertegun, the record featured six songs including what many consider to be his standout piece, 'Lonely Woman.'    But believe me when I tell you, 'The Shape of Jazz to Come' is FAR more than just 'Lonely Woman.' All six songs are jazz masterpieces with Coleman blowing away at his saxophone, and featuring Don Cherry on cornet, Charlie Haden on the double bass, and Billy Higgins on drums.     The record's six tracks are all masterpieces in their own right, but my favorite track would be the nine minute 'Peace.' Coleman is at his finest here, as is his backing group, in my opinion.     So for people who haven't heard 'The Shape of Jazz to Come,' or have heard it but don't own it, BUY IT RIGHT NOW. This album is not only one of the finest jazz records ever to be made, but it is one of the finest records to be made PERIOD.    This is an avant-garde jazz masterpiece. I can't say it enough, you don't have a jazz record collection until you have 'The Shape of Jazz to Come' in it.    Overall, I recommend this album to anybody. It's an amazing record. If you like jazz even a little bit, than you'll love this album.     Highly, highly recommended. This is a must-own for any jazz fan or any music fan in general.    ENJOY!!!
1440423911|1.0|Before reading A Christmas Carol, I automatically gave the book the highest regard probably because I was influenced by the Disney's movie version, at least that's what I thought the book would be like. Well, it didn't turn out to be the case. Admittedly I am a huge fan of Charles Dickens' novels and consider David Copperfield one of my favorite books, I've felt A Christmas Carol a drastic departure from author's usual style.<br /><br />What I noticed the most in the book is the usage of the many five dollar words (This might be the reason, I realize now, that there are alternate versions of the story and especially in abridged form). Not only those words made it difficult to read, they helped to provide detachment for me from enjoying the story and being immersed in the tale.<br /><br />What is worse, I simply didn't like the story all that much because I've felt my motivation to be lacking when Ebenezer Scrooge was hand-picked for the journey. Thinking of the kind of a person he is, why can't a worthier person be selected? That's why I prefer the tale of It's a Wonderful Life over A Christmas Carol, and it did happen to a better person than Scrooge.<br /><br />One worst part about A Christmas Carol is the force of the audience to love Christmas to death. I am not too keen about this approach because it feels too religious in the wrong way. Then again, the entire story is too religious for my taste with a lot of overtones in a spiritual sense. Charles Dickens also gives poverty a role in A Christmas Carol, but I don't like the part where a character is judged by how he views money as he sees fit.<br /><br />All in all, I've found A Christmas Carol a disappointing read, and all of the characters are unmemorable for me.
0517548232|5.0|This is one of two books that should be required reading for all high school students. This in civics class...if there is still such a thing..., so youth will know how the world works. It is, of course, the classic economics text. It was written in 1946. Nothing, and I mean nothing, as changed.
1592332803|5.0|I love this cookbook. I have tried lots of the recipes. All are just as good, if not better than non-vegan versions. Others have said things about the amount of sugar or vegan butter used in most of the recipes. To them I say come on .....IT'S a TREAT cookbook.  None of us bake goodies for there nutritional value:) The banana nut muffin's were a huge hit in my husband 's office. And I get lots of request for the chocolate chip cookies. But to be 100% honest I have not had a lot of luck with the vanilla cupcakes.<br /><br />I recommend and buy it as a gift for all my friends and family members, vegan and non-vegan, alike.

B001CVCB9O|5.0|I have been digesting this album for some time, and it has yet to diminish its stature in my eyes.  It is by far my favorite album of 2008.  As a fan of Calexico, I have always followed and enjoyed their work.  Nothing prepared me for this.  The mood of the southwest is pervasive, but does not overpower a set of songs strong from start to finish.  Previous work had struggled with this issue - mood and style vs substance.  This album has both.  It may seem to have an identity crisis at times as it roams from style to style, but the current is always in the same direction.  You never lose sight of the band, which happened at times with Garden Ruin.  But you also don't get lost in a conversation you can't understand, as happens in Feast of Wire.  It's simply the most mature, enjoyable thing they've produced.  It's got everything you loved about In The Reins, Feast of Wire, and Garden Ruin, and it blends it all together to reveal unexpected pleasures.  I was hooked the moment I heard Slowness and it was over after that.  A mountain of delight.  That slowness has indeed never gone away.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|As my title says, Supernatural is one of, if not THE best show ever!! It's the most original and it always keeps its fans wanting more!! I will most DEFINITELY be adding Season 4 to my collection!
B0002BO05S|4.0|This film gets toasted a lot, even by Christians, and I think unfairly. Yes, if you know your Gospels, you hear Jesus' speeches way out of order, and a few other things aren't 100 percent on the mark, but some of it is nit-picking.    After a long absence and my first look at this on the ultra widescreen (2.75:1) DVD, I was very impressed. For instance, the scene with the Last Supper shows everyone at the table, which is impossible to do in a formatted-to-TV mode. This, and other similar panoramic shots that are very impressive. gave me a new appreciation of the work director George Stevens did here.     Upon that recent viewing, I was please that none of Jesus' quotes are inaccurate and I have never had a problem with Max Von Sydow's portrayal of Christ. He had a penetrating eyes and spoke his lines with authority. Why he, too, gets bashed by a few people is unfair. He was just fine.    It's a sanitized message, nothing that \\"preachy\\" to turn off the unchurched, but I do think it was a bit too slow to go three hours and 20 minutes. Lopping off 15-30 minutes might have helped. It's still worth viewing, no matter what your \\"religious\\" views.
0307346617|2.0|World War Z is put together as a collection of interviews with different people who survived the world wide zombie war. Each survivors story is a first hand account of what they went through. It's a clever idea and Max Brooks deserves credit for adding a new twist to the zombie genre. Unfortunately, World War Z misses the mark in some key areas.<br /><br />  The biggest problem is the lack of any main characters. No hero to follow along with or to care about. Each surviviors account lasts just a few pages. They tell their story and then it moves on to someone else. It's delivered dryly and at times reads like a courtroom document or committee testimony.<br /><br />  The interviews could be what a great zombie book is created from. By themselves they seem to be pieces to a puzzle the writer should put together first, before being published. I get that Brooks wanted to make the zombie war seem real and authentic by interviewing the survivors but it seems incomplete and jumbled.<br /><br />  Another problem World War Z has is the same one other zombie stories have, it's totally unbelievable. Slow, lumbering, and completely unintelligent zombies take over large portions of the globe and wipe out most of humanity. It's highly unlikely, especially since you have to be bitten to become a zombie. It's not a big problem but because the book is trying to be a \\"true\\" accounting this problem does stand out more.<br /><br />  World War Z is not all bad. At times it's entertaining and there are moments where a survivor's tale will help pull you in but those moments were too far in between.
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|Kate Winslet is just outstanding in this very interesting film that is almost two stories-in-one. The first part is a sexual story of an older woman having affairs with a teenage boy and the second part is her war crimes tale and what happens afterward. The first is a somewhat happy jaunt of a short story and the second is a very serious and depressing story. That's where Winslet really shines. Obviously, she's developed into an an outstanding actress.    The second part is what most people, I assume, will remember about this film. Can \\"Hanna Schmitz,\\" a Nazi employee (so to speak), who was part of concentration camps, be a sympathetic character? To me, that's what it looked like that's the question the story was asking. The answer may have come in the final minutes of the movie when her ex-lover \\"Michael Berg,\\" now grown up and played by Ralph Fiennes, confronts a survivor of the camp. That, too, was very intense and interesting scene. Lena Olin is riveting as \\"Rose/Illana Mather.\\"    \\"The Reader\\" was full of quiet, but intense scenes. This is a very thought-provoking film, especially for one that doesn't start off that way but look almost like some soft-porn flick to get our attention. It is anything but that.    For Germans, this film must bring out many emotions and thoughts. Guilt and forgiveness are just two of the issues that are dealt with in this unique film. \\"Hanna Schmitz\\" turns out to be an incredibly simple-yet-complex person, unlike any I've encountered on film in a long time. You see her in all kinds of light, both good and bad.    Kudos, too, to David Kross' acting as the young Michael Berg. It must be strange for someone his age (barely turned 18) to do the scenes he did with 30-something Winslet.    Overall, a very different and excellent film that stays with you and makes you ponder its main characters.

B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Spoilers coming....              This new version of Trek, with young actors playing the younger versions of the TOS crew, is exciting from beginning to end, with lots of action, adventure, humor, and creativity.  You have to keep up with the time travel twists, courtesy of LOST co-creator JJ Abrams.  And a certain very important planet filled with pointy-eared folk disappears. This makes certain events of the later series impossible.  You might also find it odd that Spock and Uhura have a thing for each other and don't hide it, that Sulu carries a sword into battle, that some Romulans have tattoos, and that Sarek looks awfully old and is awfully nice to young Spock--much nicer than he was in TOS.  Chris Pine has blue eyes, which Kirk never did.  And Uhura is little more than eye candy.      If you can handle all of that, though, you will like the movie.  The fellow playing Chekov is adorable, while Karl Urban really takes the cake as McCoy.  Zachary Quinto is a marvel as Spock.  It would be nice to see more prequels, actually.  And we still don't know all the events that transpired while these folks were going through the academy.      A great summer popcorn movie for sure.

B00150W1K6|5.0|This album is the epitamy of 90s rock/ nu-rock/ acid rock era.  If you can't categorize it, who cares?  It's still a killer album.<br /><br />The spirit of the music transports and would actually be good for meditating (if you want to really GO places while meditating) or even while on drugs.  It is that multi-dimensional.  The sexy bass, the slow layered drums, the weird sound effects, and the sultry voice of Mr Trent Reznor can really perk the ear and make you zero in on their talents.<br /><br />This is by far the best of their albums.  I'm not a fan of the new stuff because it seems so synthesized, but... Downward Spiral is a cd that I cannot get enough of.  I've been listening to it for over 10 years and it still has the ability to stop me in my tracks and make me tune in, carrying me across the wires of my mind.<br /><br />Highly highly reccommend to fans of Manson, Korn, Pumpkins, Deftones, Daft Punk, Coheed & Cambria, and even some of the System fans.
1401216676|5.0|I will start out by saying i am new to comics. and new to batman. i have read maybe 10 or so comics/tpb in my life prior to this book. what pulled me to this book, like some of you, is the movie Dark Knight.     so, is the killing joke good? yes, of course. this edition especially. the art is beautiful and an absolute pleasure to look at/read (i have a problem with comic book art of yesteryear, i think it looks incredibly childish, this book looks wonderful). this edition also contains a short 3 page comic in the end about good/evil which i absolutely loved, its a philosophical debate a man in going through in his head about who is good and who is evil and how does one truly know oneself. in fact this mini-comic goes great to explain how the joker can go from the person he was, to who he is now.    the killing joke itself is pretty good read, i found it to be short for a tpb but later understood its really just a slightly longer comicbook (not a collection of many comics). this book has been hyped up a lot before i bought it and i was expecting something incredible, it isnt incredible but extremely enjoyable and totally worth the price.     my biggest problem with it is that it leaves you craving more. more of the same art/writing/story telling. i found that it will be very difficult to get more as most other comics with the joker portray him as a laughing fool, rather than a truly insane, calculating murderer.     this book also has (in my opinion) one of the best origin stories for the joker (told via flashbacks) which is a little more grounded in reality and not the usual comicbook fantasy flair.     batman here is portrayed as an intelligent detective who is feared and respected. he seems very deep and troubled, possessing many internal demons and finding purpose in his life by doing what he does.     this book is pretty close to rational reality, without too much (or any) suspension of disbelief necessary. this has always been my favorite part of batman (and the reason i hated all the batman films between the original one and batman begins).     if anyone has any recommendations please put it in the comments.
1595141715|1.0|What will you say to the parent who finds out after the fact that their child commits suicide and has to read the book later to find out why? I think this is a bad idea gone bad.

Enjoy the money you get from the book Asher, but remember the parents who are grieving... Oh, did I strike a note? Hope so! Another parent was able to intercept the note and intercede to prevent my daughter from being a victim.... While it may help those who are victimizing our children to see the error of their ways... Do you really think you can reach them?... You can't! The damage is already done. I hope the kids this book \\"has the potential to save\\", do call the crisis numbers, but don't count on it.

B001FB55HG|3.0|I went to see Terminator: Salvation with an open mind, even while knowing that most reviews have been harsh. I admire what James Cameron did with the first two films in the series and they are easily 5 star classics. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had some good parts, but it was a failure when compared to what came before it. The same goes here for the fourth movie in the franchise, though I think it's a little better. Sure the SFX and action scenes are very good, but it's the writing, acting and character developement that Salvation lacks. There is some really bad dialogue being thrown around and it didn't wow me even once. Christian Bale isn't as bad here as some critics are saying, but he doesn't make John Connor into anything special. Sam Worthington does the most here in terms of making you care about him, but that is mainly due to the fact that he is the more interesting character of the bunch because of what he is. I'll admit that it was cool seeing the famous T-800 design again on the BIG screen and Arnold in the flesh, even though it looks like he was just cut in from the first Terminator film and cleaned up using CGI.<br /><br />I left the theater thinking that Terminator: Salvation was just one explosion after another courtesy of director McG and nothing more. This vision of the future is a far cry from the small glimpses we got in The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Too bad, because what James Cameron started and perfected in 1984 and 1991, is now nothing more than mindless popcorn entertainment.
0618918248|3.0|This book rests on two principal arguments.  First, Dawkins claims  that the hypothesis of intelligent design, which he calls the \\"God  hypothesis,\\" is a scientific hypothesis that is refuted by natural  selection, and therefore religion itself is refuted.  Second, Dawkins  argues that insofar as religion doesn't depend on the God hypothesis,  it's not a productive way to think and should be abandoned.    Dawkins' #1 argument works well as scientific argument -- yes, natural  selection beats the pants off intelligent design as a scientific  hypothesis supported by evidence -- but it's too obvious to be very  powerful as a weapon against religion.  For most religious people, the  argument will seem irrelevant because their commitment to religion  flows from \\"something else\\" (faith, love, divine inspiration, etc.)  that just feels so different from scientific method or discourse that  any attempt to refute it with science is a colossal mistake.  It's  like trying to prove that Albert Pujols is a better baseball player  than Alex Rodriguez by playing the violin.  It seems Dawkins' only  response to this is to switch to the #2 argument: whatever the  \\"something else\\" is that religious people rely on instead of science,  it's nonsense.  This shows that the #1 argument has little independent  force, and the #2 argument needs to do most of the work.    Unfortunately, Dawkins' #2 argument fares even worse.  It consists  mostly of disconnected examples of things said and done by various  persons throughout history in the name of religion, followed in each  case with a sneering \\"Isn't this stupid and/or silly and/or repulsive?  I can't believe that any sane person would think this way.\\"  This  isn't productive, because a lot of sane people do think this way, and  they derive a lot of consolation and meaning from religion.  It also  ignores the fact that many of the most significant and inspiring  achievements of the human imagination (religious art, the pyramids,  the cathedrals, the religious music of J.S. Bach, etc.) would never  have occurred without religion.  So religion can't be *all* bad.    In fact, there is a variant of Dawkins' #2 claim that I find  compelling (I am an atheist as well).  To introduce this claim, note  that there is an important difference between religious belief and  other abstract beliefs, like belief in morality or justice.  Religion  makes claims like \\"God exists\\" or \\"I shall go to heaven\\" that purport  to be about actual or potential experience.  \\"God exists\\" says there  exists some set of circumstances under which I could actually  experience God.  Otherwise, what could it mean for God to exist,  except perhaps as a metaphor (as in the case of Einstein's God that  Dawkins discusses in Chapter 1)?  I call this type of claim an  \\"experiential claim.\\"    I believe that experiential claims should be supported by actual  experience: either direct observation, or reported observation by  others that I would also share, with a high degree of certainty, in  the same situation.  I call this belief the experiential claim  requirement, or ECR.  If the ECR were established, then Dawkins' #1  claim would follow naturally, because the God hypothesis is an  experiential claim for which the observable evidence is at best very  suspect, as Dawkins nicely argues in Chapter 3.    But what kind of argument could we use to establish the ECR?  A  successful argument, in my view, would go something like this:    (a.)  Start with a sympathetic description of religion's aspirations,  what motivates so many people to believe in it.    (b.) Argue either that those aspirations should be abandoned, or that  they can be satisfied by other practices and institutions that also  satisfy the ECR.    (c.) Argue that institutions and practices that satisfy the ECR are  better, on balance, than ones that don't.    This is similar to how the philosopher Richard Rorty goes about  arguing that we should abandon quasi-religious philosophy in favor of  more \\"pragmatic\\" practices like science, literature, and art.    Now some of Dawkins' arguments do support (b.) and (c.).  The  arguments that God is a \\"skyhook\\" that just postpones the question  (Chapter 4), that morality can exist without religion (Chapter 6), and  that scientific wonder can replace religious wonder (Chapter 10) all  support (b.).  Russell's \\"celestial teapot\\" example that Dawkins  dwells on in Chapter 2 obliquely supports (c.); the implication is  that we insist on the ECR in our everyday experience, so we should  insist it of religion as well.  In Chapter 9, Dawkins makes a good  argument that non-ECR practices like religion are repressive to the  extent that they condition people (especially children) with beliefs  that may not be questioned by evidence or argument.  This certainly  supports (c.).  However, Dawkins never connects these individual  pieces into a broader sustained argument against religion, as  suggested in the previous paragraph.    A more serious problem is that Dawkins is too contemptuous of religion  to make any serious attempt at (a.).  He tries to skip (a.)  and throw  religion over wholesale by showing how absurd religious belief is, and  how it inevitably leads to outcomes that are at best wrong and at  worst catastrophic.  This position is deeply unsatisfying to someone  like me, who sympathizes with what religion is trying to do even if  its experiential claims are impossible to accept.  A much more subtle  argument is needed, one that acknowledges the validity of religious  experience, but also argues that we can get \\"beyond\\" religion (while  preserving what is good in religion) by making all our practices, even  ones that touch the deepest and most unknowable questions posed by  man, obey the ECR.  Note that doesn't mean we will turn them all into  science or even reason, which is what it sometimes seems that Dawkins  wants to do.    So in the end, I agree with Dawkins' conclusion but am unimpressed by  his arguments.  I picked up this book expecting to find good arguments  for why our beliefs about actual or potential experience should be  backed by evidence.  I did get some scattered arguments along these  lines.  But mostly, I got a nice scientific argument for something I  already knew (that natural selection impressively explains the origin  of life) and a rambling, simplistic indictment of religion.
B001FB4W16|5.0|I've been reading the Southern Vampire series since the first book came out.  I don't get HBO, but I read that this was the most popular HBO series since Sex & the City.  So when Season 1 came out on Blu-ray, I got it.  Season 1 is based on the first book in the series (there are now 9 books in the series).    Overall, I love the tv series.  There are minor changes from the books.  The side characters get more screen time, such as Tara, Jason and Lafayette.  Tara was a wonderful, complex, tough and vulnerable best friend.  Jason was the comic relief.  Lafayette was very interesting, as he is now the cook, road crew, drug dealer, prostitute, and friend of Sookie.  Sookie had the scared/nervous grin and the same sweetness and toughness that she has in the books.  I didn't understand why the actors playing Sam and Bill were cast, but once I watched the tv series, I totally understand.  Bill was perfect - hot, a bit scary and cold, but really loving and protective of Sookie.  After watching this, forget about being Mrs. Cullen, I'll be Mrs. Compton.  It really reminded me why Sookie loved Bill in the beginning of the series.  Adele was great.  What really caught my eye was how complex and detailed each scene was.  It really made Bon Temps and Shreveport seem alive and full of individual, real characters.  Dawn, Hoyt, Rene, Arlene, Andy, Mike, Pam, they're all there.    What I was really unprepared for and thought was a bit excessive: (1) There is a lot of swearing - lots of b*** and f*** from the cast.  (2) There is a lot of nudity (naked breasts, butts, back views) and vigorous sexual activity in almost every episode.  Jason is usually mostly naked in his scenes and mindlessly banging a mostly naked woman.  In the first episode alone, there is Maudette naked, her arms tied above her head to the ceiling, being violently bounced from behind by a vampire and later Jason.  Very graphic.    Other than the 2 things above, I enjoyed the series so much I'd say 5 stars.

I have been baking gluten-free for several years, made the cinnamon-apple toastie cake.  The recipe must be incorrect.  The batter is very watery and did not even bake all the way through.

B001PPLIEQ|3.0|By a fluke we wound up sitting on Virgin America Main Cabin Select, so you could see any movie you wanted for free, and I raced right into QUANTUM OF SOLACE, a film I had missed during its theatrical run.  Hooray for MGM and the Broccoli family for going back to the Ian Fleming list of titles and finding one that's authentic, though the movie I saw has very little to do with Fleming's original short story of the same name, except for maybe a certain mood--the yearning for solace hinted at in the title of the film, and in Daniel Craig's performance.  I can just see the marketers' aghast faces when they are told that the new movie will be called -- whaaat?  Nobody in the US knows what quantum means -- except physicists -- and nobody in the universe knows how to say \\"solace.\\"!!  I'll have two tickets for -- oh never mind, the James Bond film.  The screenwriters could have made the heroine's name \\"Solace,\\" I guess, they always have inventive names, like Strawberry Fields here, but they let that temptation pass.  Will the next Bond movies be RISICO and THE HILDEBRAND RARITY?  I'm ready!<br /><br />But then when the movie kicked in, I found it rather disappointing.  The picture was all over the place, literally, it just seemed dumb.  \\"James, we've discovered that the gum wrapper you picked up at the crime scene was made in Afghanistan.\\"  Whoosh--another jet lands and Bond gets off the plane in Afghanistan.  He's there 5 minutes, kills 150 people, then the story whimsically takes him to Copenhagen or Zaire.  They used to do that in the Roger Moore days, but do they really need to do it with Daniel Craig?  In fact, DC was good as a novelty, but his appeal is wearing off rapidly.  His underplaying does allow minor characters to steal whole scenes from him, like Giancarlo Giannini, looking more Omar Sharif-ish than ever.  Halfway through I realized that the villains' scheme was going to be to round up a monopoly of water in Bolivia and that's when my giggles began.  I never really did stop giggling, and the steward came by with a blanket for me--a Snuggie--something to ground me.  It was a choice of either way the Snuggie or face house arrest.  I accepted the former and that was my quantum of solace for a letdown of a Bond.d stop giggling, and the steward came by with a blanket for me--a Snuggie--something to ground me.

B001UGIIMA|4.0|I try to review my Blu Rays as a product, but once in awhile the movie seeps through to give it a higher rating.<br /><br />Picture: a split. The clarity, depth and color all look good BUT, Universal skimped and decided to not do artifact removal. There is such a quantity of foreign material throughout that it actually detracts from some scenes. Especially the roof top scene where Brad throws the chair. Virtually every frame has someone's hair, flakes or sweater lint clogging up the white sky. The Tony Scott yellow lens looks good in Blu, but by the end of the film - a big white film wear goes across Redford's face, followed by a customer asking when I was going to play the Blu to compare (hated to say I was).<br /><br />The sound - DTS sounded the same as the DVD, maybe some nice clarity upgrades but I think I was trying hard to find them.<br /><br />The special features - same as DVD.<br /><br />Menu - they changed it, which sucked for me because I liked the old music and it used to get a customer's attention as it looped. Now, they cleaned up different scenes and spliced them in with elevator music. Otherwise, the usual left-sided Universal menu and navigation.<br /><br />This would be a 3-star Blu for features and DTS with an average picture quality, but it has to go up one for being an awesome movie.
B00005MP58|5.0|I adore this version of Pride and Prejudice. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle will forever live in my mind as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. They are so perfect, remaking this miniseries would be a lesson in futility. The characters are captivating and completely believable. I found myself so outraged by Mr. Collins' fawning and insulting behavior I did not realize I was making sounds of disgust out loud until my husband asked what was wrong (from the other room, no less). This  film will remain timeless thanks to the superb acting, wonderful script and delightful scenery.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|I received my copy from Amazon of HBO's series \\"TRUE BLOOD\\" a couple of days ago and have been on a marathon session viewing the disks.  I enjoyed the books and was elated to learn that the books had been translated to cable TV.       I had no intention of writing a review.  I came here to read the reviews and to learn if I'd missed some perspective of the show; I didn't come here to get ticked off but that happened.      Books are books, and all books are biased to charm a certain audience, mostly in order to charm money out of the pocket of the reader.  TV is TV, and ALL of TV -- cable and commercial -- is stilted, twisted, tilted, written and repeatedly rewritten, and then stretched beyond recognition from its original conception to (the writers, directors and producers think) appeal to a very wide audience, most of whom have the mentality of idiots with 8TH grade educations, hence the need for sensationalism, erotica, and far too much profanity.  TV has to have a draw, otherwise TV shows fail, and all those involved in the production lose money, money, money.      Those considerations in mind, I'm not overly disappointed with the HBO series as each (book and TV) is a different entity with limitations and specialized commerical requirements (it's all about salability, babe), and those limitatins should be at the forefront in the mind of each consumer if that consumer wishes to make an objective evaluation.  However, I am severely disappointed by the various reviewers and their quirky attitudes.  Sorry, but I don't have time or the inclination to quote each reviewer and how/why I disagree with that particular reviewer.        In as far as the written version of \\"Sookie Stackhouse's\\" travails go, I do prefer the books because the reader becomes involved and must use his/her imagination, something that seems to be in short supply with many people and explains a decided preference for TV viewing (most people have the attention span of a gherbil).  TV does not require the degree of involvement that reading requires, nor does TV require that the viewer be literate.      As the saying goes, \\"TV is a no brainer.\\"  So it seems.  And so it seems that many of the viewers and reviewers more than adequately qualify for the epithat, since all TV requires is that one sit back and watch. A very sedantary form of recreation and addictive.      In praise of the books and the series, it is a bold new twist on vampire lore, which is the most prevailing reason to read the books and the watch the series . . . if either format is your cup of tea.  If neither format suits you, then you may be content to sit in a corner and twiddle your thumbs.       As for the series, the acting (for the most part) was uninspired and tepid, and the continuity director was apparently absent from the set during filming.  The best acting, in my opinion, was provided by \\"Vampire Bill\\" and \\"Vampire Eddie.\\"  It's odd that actors portraying  dead men (Vampires are regenerated dead, remember?)could evoke more sympathy and show more human compassion than their warm-blooded counterparts.          Stephen Moyer, whom one reviewer panned as having an unconvincing Southern accent, does the best job with the role he signed to play and had the most consistent Southern accent, quite a remarkable and laudable accomplishment for a Brit. Thus far, Mr. Moyer appears to be the only true actor in a major role in this series, and the only actor not over the top.        Many of the other characters had spotty accents.  \\"Tara,\\" for example, flucuated in her accent from an Oklahoma accent, to an Arkansas accent, both combined with a touch of a Southern Florida accent, while having no trace of a detectable Northern Louisiana accent.  Most disconcerting and confusing.  I don't know who the dialog coach was, but he/she does not deserve a raise and should have put in some overtime--for free.  Or be replaced.      At first I didn't understand the reason for greater part of the air time being dedicated on \\"Jason,\\" \\"Tara,\\" and \\"Lafayette,\\" all fairly minor book characters but necessary devices to move the story forward -- in the books.  Apparently, these strange devices and the odd characterisations were the sensationalism for the cable TV series (hence all the gratuitous and vigorous \\"sex\\" and unnecessary nudity) and also because this was a direct way to translate the book character \\"Sookie's\\" thoughts, a means (and a mean device) to move the story forward without using voice-over.  Well, duh.        Incidentally, since I'm on a roll, I understand that showing the many . . . uh, hmmm . . . libidinous encounters \\"Jason\\" had was a device to show his amoral nature and to provide the reason for suspecting him of committing a number of horrific crimes.  I'd like to point out that a display frequent, vigorous sex does not equal good sex, nor does it make one a good lover.  All it shows is that \\"Jason\\" and his many partners are  soulless, mindless, self-interested horn dogs.      As for the atomsphere portrayed in \\"TRUE BLOOD,\\" I found it realistic to the point of making me itch at the sight and sound of the night insects. I could almost feel the heat and smothering humidity of the deep South and smell the bayou stench.      Bottom line:  I have very mixed feelings about \\"TRUE BLOOD,\\" which I suppose could have been neatly condensed into that one line and saved some time.  But, I'm on my high horse now.      Among my many mixed feelings, one is my intense dislike for how \\"Sookie\\" is portrayed in the series.  In the books, \\"Sookie\\" is strong, resorceful, honest, kind, loyal, steadfast, hardworking, and caring.  A gal with a conscience.  Someone who'd never bypass a person in need. A gal the reader could care for, dream with, and hope that all would go well for her. In the series, \\"Sookie\\" comes across as a hand-wringing dimwit, and she failed to show proper respect for her grandmother, \\"Adele Stackhouse.\\"  The \\"Sookie\\" in \\"TRUE BLOOD\\" grotesquely failed to show any respect to town elders, something no correctly reared Southern girl would do.  Ever. Under any circumstances.  The \\"Sookie\\" in \\"TRUE BLOOD\\" also lacks the humor and tact of the gal in the books.        I can only hope that the series improves.  Based on my slender hope, I'm willing to withhold any truly scathing remarks and wait for the second seaon with a prayer that the series does improve by leaps and bounds because it seriously needs some major overhauls.  If there is no improvement, the series is doomed.       And this is more time than I could readily spare for this trivial project.

B0015QT78O|5.0|I first saw this show on TV when I was a little boy. It was around 1987-89 that it was first broadcast in my country and I was completely shocked with the story line it showed: a father and his son looking for the lost mother, an FBI agent who, in my opinion, has no scruples and is a little narrow-minded, and the ending we are shown... Is it really going to be released on DVD? I have been waiting for this show to be released on DVD for so long.... I wish it does! Regards!!

B000WCBPOG|4.0|I purchased Across the Universe after hearing the soundtrack only, had no idea of the story line, and had only seen the lead actor (Jim Sturgess) in another film (The Other Bolyn Girl.)  The actors in Across the Universe are all really talented and no doubt bound for bigger and better things.  Of course, it was a treat to see Eddie Izzard and Bono, not to mention cameos by Joe Cocker as well!  I set aside my expectations as I watched this film (how on earth can you make a film driven by Beatles' music without opening yourself up for comparisons?)  It was fun to see how the director and the screenwritesr wove the characters for the film from the lyrics of the songs themselves.  Take this for what it is: a fun, rollercoaster of a movie that employs the best of the music that became the soundtrack to our own lives while not shying away from the pain and tragedies of the times in which it was all written.
B000059T00|5.0|Being a clapton and winwood fan already when this album was released what can I say.Throw in ginger on the drums and Rick Grech on bass and you have at the time what they called the first rock supergroup. Just guys from other bands forming a new band to me. The whole album is superb. (Do what you like) on the second side was a little long but it got to showcase gingers druming to the max. I still play the cd often. What made me come back and reveiw this music on this day is the release of the live ClaptonWinwood dvd Live from Madison Square Garden.They cover \\" Had To Cry Today\\"  \\"Can'tFind My Way Home\\" \\"Well All Right\\" \\"Presence Of The Lord\\" But no sea of joy.Watching that concert and seeing the Blind Faith songs played again just brought me back to 1970 when this thing was released. This album really blew my head off and still does today.
B001UREJWM|4.0|Yes, the last piece of art of Heaven and Hell (Apice an Dio Black Sabbath's line up)is very dark, pretty slow but high quality composition in most of the songs.

I normally read non-fiction,true-crime,but this is as close as you can get to that type of story,being that its fiction.I would rather put my headphones on some nights and have someone with a soothing voice read to me rather than reading it to myself.

0312539517|3.0|Jeffery Archer is a fine story teller and one of my first beloved novelists having read a few of his early works, \\"Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less\\" and \\"Shall We Tell the President' before I even attended college.  I looked forward with great interest, some 25 odd years later, to digging into an engaging story about a great mystery on an exciting topic, mountaineering and the early attempts at climbing the unclimbable, Mt Everest.  \\"Paths of Glory\\" is a quick and inspiring read.  However, it is far too superficial in it's treatment of the characters to build anything more than a Harlequin type romance and the subsequent tragedy of lost love to equate this historical fiction to a real world account of George Mallory's life and times.<br /><br />Mallory's story, from the perspective of his possible victory over Everest, had to be told nevertheless.  And I am glad someone as esteemed as Archer took on the burden for the Mallory fans and for England.  I am a Mallory fan, I wish in my heart that he actually made the summit, but I know in practical reality that the victory of his expeditions were not in reaching the summit but in providing all the lower rungs of the ladder necessary for future expeditions, and in fact Hillary and Norgays successful bid almost 30 years later.  If you read about Hillary's bid one just begins to understand how truly difficult it is to climb Mt Everest. With \\"Path's of Glory\\" as with many things British, one almost gets the feeling that an expedition to Everest could just as easily have been slightly more challenging than the summer trips these early climbers did take to climb in the Alps, just a little farther away.<br /><br />I was disappointed in this book because I thought perhaps, or was lead to believe early on, that this book was really a mystery novel that delved deep into the evidence of the case, a forensics examination for instance.  As it turns out, there is still very little evidence to support even a modest claim that Mallory made the summit.  The eye witness testimony of Dr. Odell and the hearsay account of Mallory's daughter that Mallory always carried a picture of his wife intent on leaving the picture at the Summit.  The fact that the picture was not with Mallory when is body was discovered in 1999 seems to be the only compelling argument that he made the summit at all, which of course, is based on nothing factual.  Nevertheless the intrigue of the mystery remains.<br /><br />In the end this a light novel that introduces the drama of early mountaineering along with the politics and personalities of the Royal Geological Society in England during this time period...not a penny more, not a penny less.mmit.

B00004YW6I|3.0|being a PJ Harvey hard die fan. This is my least favorite album of hers. The music is fine. but just not as courageus and breathtaking as her previous work. The album starts off and finishes without a moment where you would stop and really listen to the music. Nothing stands out of it. Is just pure and bland almost popish music where the lyrics are just predictable love anthems.   It's not a bad album don't get me wrong. If you like well done pop music you will most likely enjoy it. It's just too easy listening for any previous PJ Harvey fan.   When she was asked about this particular one she just said it is an album where she tried to make everything beautiful. And believe me that's what she got. pure and plain ''beautiful tunes''. But maybe just too beautiful. If you know what i mean. Try picking up Rid of me, to bring you my love or the innovative is this desire?. And you'll get a glimpse of why this simply isn't her. at least not her musical essence.
0385341008|5.0|I bought this book on a whim and had no idea it was so popular -- which, of course, doesn't necessarily mean it's good. But \\"The Guerney Literary and Potato Peel Society\\", in my view, deserves all the acclaim it has received. The correspondence between the characters, mostly in Britain and in the island of Guernsey, creates the whole story. The characters are well built, solid and consistent (and in some cases quite charming), and the narrative style flows very well. The wealth of information about how the Nazi occupation of Guernsey during World War II happened is amazing, and quite shocking. Yes, there is the backdrop of a love story going on, but in my view the narrative style and the historical facts make this an outstanding work. I was sorry it finished so quickly!

B0000085N4|4.0|The Cult were a powerhouse at the end of the 80's and only lame [...] rock critics would even dare to lump them in with the rest of the fairly generic hair metal family. However if one of their records compares to that often lambasted genre then 1989's `Sonic Temple' would be the one. This album had multiple radio and MTV hits, four at least including monster lead single \\"Fire Woman\\" and power ballad \\"Edie\\". \\"Sun King\\" kicks of the LP in truly epic fashion and is easily for me the best song. The lyric sort of speaks of an immortal weariness at everlasting life and the need for the love of mortal woman, or something like that, but it's not the words man, it's Ian! He is truly the straw that stirs this particular brew. Together with long time guitar foil Billy Duffy, the two Cultists create their most commercially sounding and successful record. Frequent Bruce Fairbairn collaborator and future Metallica producer Bob Rock was on hand to replace Rick Rubin (Rock also did Motley Crue's `Dr.Feelgood' in the same year!) and the backbeat takes an almost Zeppelinesque quality whereas `Electric' saw AC/DC as a bigger influence. \\"American Horse\\", \\"Sweet Soul Sister\\" and \\"Medicine Train\\" sort of round up the best of the rest for me because I'm  not as hot for `Sonic Temple' as I am for `Electric' or even `Love'. It seemed as if the Cult were becoming what mainstream (meaning corporate America) wanted from an English rock band, and that wasn' t really in the band's best interest because it took them away from what made them unique. The dogs lay at your feet...the wind caressed your cheek...

It's just good to have it in a nice package.  I DO love the DVD, but I wish it was longer.  Good live stuff I've never seen before, plus it's nice to have a good quality DVD version of their videos from OK Computer.  All in all, it's a good package.

Simply perfect.

B000F12OXU|5.0|First of all, this is a superb album, which I still enjoy after 40 years.    It has passed the test of time in my rock collection.  It is a great rock album from a great rock band before they became just another successful loud rock band.    As an audiophile jerk, I think this CD sounds like it was recorded from a record.    It's a professional looking CD, but if you listen closely on a high resolution system, you can hear low level turntable noise and the occasional click and pop.  It also sounds somewhat harsh, as does my LP version.     Update:  Don't spend money on the other CD pressing available from Amazon: I just heard it and it sounds absolutely painful.  I take back my comments on harshness.  This version sounds MUCH MUCH better.

B001SO69IY|4.0|Method Man & Redman return after almost 10 years since their last collabo album and 7 ½ years since their \\"How High Soundtrack\\" with a very solid 4 star album.  After being in the rap game for 16+ years most know what to expect when these 2 get on the mic and when they collaborate on songs. I think this album is a notch aboue the first \\"Blackout!\\" album (which I'd also give 4 stars).  I do like their solo works better than their collaboration albums, most of their solo's I'd give 4.5 stars.  This one has some funnier tracks and some smoking tracks as well as some nice lyrical ones too.  Of the 15 songs, 2 are ok and the other 13 are good or real good songs but there is no classics on here.  Guests are on 4 songs rapping and doing the chorus on 4 others.  Production is solid as well.  Rockwilder & Erick Sermon each do 2 songs, Bink One!, King David, Havoc, Pete Rock, Swiff D, Nasty Kutt, Ty Fyffe, and Buckwild all do 1 song.  A nice album to have from 2 hip-hop veterans.    #1 - 8  #2 - 8  #3 - 8.5 (f/ Saukrates -- nice laid back beat)  #4 - 8.5 (funky upbeat track)  #5 - 8 (f Keith Murray, who with Method Man kill this track)  #6 - 7 (f/ Poo Bear)  #8 - 7.5  #10 - 8.5 (relaxing O'Jay's sample beat)  #11 - 9 (f/ Ready Roc & Street Life -- nice beat)  #12 - 9 (nice beat)  #14 - 8 (f/ Raekwon & Ghostface Killah)  #15 - 9 (tight beat)  #16 - 8 (f/ Poo Beaar)  #17 - 8 (f/ Melanie Rutherford)    METHOD MAN -- Clifford Smith -- b. 4/1/1971 -- b.

0563486430|2.0|I have read online fan fiction that better captures tension, characterization, and thrill of Doctor Who than this disappointment does.  It feels hastily written, choppily edited, and rushed out to capitalize on the market value of the then-new Tenth Doctor.  The root idea of this book is full of promise, but it just doesn't follow through in a way that justifies my hard-earned book money.    Mickey Smith finds an ancient Roman statue of Rose in the British Museum, dressed as a Roman goddess.  So naturally the Doctor and Rose pop off to Rome, where they immediately encounter a father in desperate straits, a sculptor whose uncanny skill has made him an overnight celebrity, and a seeress whose predictions are unaccountably accurate.  For starters.    Problem is, the book is a bunch of bait-and-switch.  The sculptor is wrapped up in the early chapters, the father fumbles around like the author wasn't sure what to do with him, and the seeress is so extraneous that I didn't realize she'd disappeared for something like sixty pages.  And finally, in Act III, it's revealed that the story isn't really about any of these anyway.    This book's concept shows such potential, but the execution is disappointing.  It reads like the outline to a longer, better book.  Author Jacqueline Rayner needs a firm editor to sit her down and say, \\"This is level one.  Now let's push it to level three.\\"  I'm going to stick this on a high shelf and watch my DVDs, which are tightly paced and robustly plotted.  Thanks anyhow.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Who says that there's nothing new under the sun? With an ocean of new music that vies for our attention every single day of our lives, it is hard for anything to stand out as decidedly unique, or original. As a lifelong music nut, I sometimes find it difficult to fight off the jaded sense that I've heard it all before, and there is nothing left but variations on familiar themes. The reason I still listen to as much music as I possibly can stems partly from habit, and partly from the outside hope that I may stumble on something new, unique, surprising and inspiring. \\"Playing for Change\\" is just such a collection. I had no expectations, so the sheer emotional power of this collection caught me by surprise and hit me square between the eyes.<br />  The title \\"Playing for Change\\" is a conceptually clever play on words that addresses the exact nature of the collection, which gathers recordings from various street musicians from around the globe, and `mashes up' their performances into one seamless whole. All of the material has political implications based on the simple concept that world peace is achievable if we overcome the barriers that separate us. To this end, a song like \\"Stand By Me\\" begins simply enough, with a California street musician singing the Ben E. King classic, but then shifts to post-Katrina New Orleans with a new set of performers. As it progresses, stylists from the Netherleands, New Mexico, France, Brazil, Russia, Italy, Venezuela, the Congo, South Africa, and Spain each chip in with a new bit that allows the performance to build to an emotional crescendo. The various songs each feature different artists from different locales. Can you imagine hearing Bob Marley's \\"One Love\\" being sung by performers who are thousands of miles apart, while accompanied by Indian tabla and sitar? This could have been a complete mess if it hadn't been done right, but the production is seamless and focused, and elicits the intended emotional effect of inspiring the listener to believe that music really does have the power to unite people.<br />I challenge you to listen to or watch this without welling up at some point. There is just too much emotional resonance to remain inured from music this passionate, relevant and uplifting. To get the full impact of these performances, I highly recommend that you watch the DVD disk that accompanies the CD, which allows you to visualize the miracle of mixing dozens of performers from as many locations, all coming together to create something unified, as if it were cut from whole cloth. Music is an ephemeral thing, yet it somehow manages to touch us in a myriad of ways. It can elicit any number of emotions , but it is especially sweet when music can make us feel good about ourselves, and happy about our potential, both individually and globally. Every song on \\"Playing for Change\\" plays to our better nature, yet it never gets cloying or syrupy with emotion. If you ever doubted the power of music, then you need to hear (and see) \\"Playing for Change.\\"  A  Tom Ryanto believe that music really does have the power to unite people.

B001P9KR94|1.0|I was surprised by all the positive reviews for this movie. Very simply, the movie is contrived to present about two hours of unrelenting sadism and cruelty to innocent children and teenagers.  This is apparently to provide the audience with a chance to have \\"emotions\\" which are fulfilled with a \\"happy\\" ending so people can feel \\"warm and fuzzy\\".  I hate to think that some people enjoy the sadism and cruelty in this movie for its own sake, at a deep pleasure level, but that also seems to be what's going on.    Although clearly rooted in real life misery caused by unspeakable injustice, this movie does absolutely nothing to inspire the viewer to work towards changing these conditions.  It was just a \\"fun\\" two hours, wasn't it?  Poverty in India is feel-good stuff and certainly does no permanent harm to anybody as long as they keep their romance alive.  No wonder the majority of people in India reacted to this movie with great anger, having been portrayed as cartoon characters in a manipulative and two-dimensional soap opera.    For those who would like to see a great movie that covers the exact same subject matter, but treats the characters, the subject and the audience with respect, check out 'Salaam Bombay' from a few years ago.

B000009N6M|2.0|This acoustic-ish album by The Smashing Pumpkins is one of their best. If you haven't checked it out, do yourself a favor. This vinyl version is an alternate Mono mix that sounds great and is enclosed within great, colorful artwork on the front.    Manufacturing issues:    The material of the sleeve that encloses the vinyl is cheap recycled paper that seems ever ready to absorb water. I don't think durability is what they had in mind with this release.    The first copy I received has a bunch of scratches, skip-riddled tracks, and 3 loops on side 2 of the first disc. It was hectic to listen to it. Everything else was perfect. The second copy had a loop on side 1 and 2 of the first disc, and a few skips on side 2 of the first disc. While the second copy isn't perfect, I'm not going to exchange it again because it's not worth it.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Perfect game for our family of four. Our 8 year old can't just try and beat his little sister by focusing on making it harder for her. (As he can with a game like Sorry.) He does that, he knows he can lose by letting the other two players have more freedom to place pieces.    Our 6 year old can use her natural smarts to her advantage without the handicap of just now learning the \\"value\\" of money or her lack of \\"killer instinct\\" when it comes to a game like Monopoly.    It's a great game because it requires thinking and isn't based on the luck of the dice.     We've given this as a gift to several kids and every parent thanks us afterward once they have a chance to play.    The only warning is to make sure you count every piece before playing. We had guests over and didn't realize they'd dumped out the box which meant we had to go searching for tiny yellow tiles.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|Probably inspired by Anne Rice's novels, this new version of vampire lore is far more interesting than Blade, Underworld, Twilight, Buffy, etc.  It takes place in a small town in Louisianna and has a real Cajun feel to it.  The premise is that vampires have admitted their existance so a blood substitute (True Blood) has been developed and sold wherever beverages are sold.<br /><br />The first season centered on a vampire named Bill moving into a Louisianna town and he fascinates Suki who works a Merlot's, a local restaurant.  Probably the main reason for Suki's attraction is that she is a mind reader and when she lets her guard down she usually hears embarassing thoughts from her male suitors.  As Bill is undead, she is not able to read his thoughts and in her mind, she is able to have a \\"normal\\" relationship with him.<br /><br />The main themes are that the vampires are seeking civil rights and acceptance while a murderer is loose in the town, preying on women that are on friendly terms with vampires.  Suki's brother Jason always seems to be the prime suspect.<br /><br />As the season went on we were introduced to a whole society of vampires who mostly congregate at a bar in a nearby town.  It is always dangerous for humans to enter the bar as the story is they don't get out alive.  Of course Suki makes Bill take her there.  The head of the bar seems to be the local \\"Don\\" of the vampires and we later find out that he reports to a higher council, which dispenses swift justice with fury.<br /><br />I am really enjoying the show so far and look forward to the new episodes being launched in June!  This is probably the best drama on cable right now!
B001VLBDD0|5.0|Thanks to the new master, the detail is much greater on this DVD than previous releases. You're able to see small, fine, details in the backgrounds that you simply could not make out on the Ultimate Edition. That coupled with the adjusted color (supervised and approved by Lightstorm) and other improvements over previous releases; makes this the best looking Terminator 2 on DVD.    The harsh contrast found on the previous DVD is lowered to a much more natural level, which gives the overall picture a more film-like appearance. Even better, the excessive edge enhancement is just about completely gone. If those were the only improvements, it'd be enough to recommend the disc over the old transfer, but they aren't.    2000's Ultimate Edition featured a very good 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer that only had a couple minor problems. Most distracting was an excessive amount of edge enhancement, more grain than was normal for a Super 35 movie, and contrast that was just a bit hot.    For this new Extreme Edition, THX retransferred using the highest technology possible right now. They created a new electronic film master of the movie at the stunning resolution of 1920x1080 24 FPS. Basically, this new master would allow them to create new transfers of T2 for HDTV, and digital theatrical showings. This DVD is created from that gorgeous master, and is easily the best Terminator 2 has ever looked on the DVD format.     10 out of 10. BUY THIS DVD!
B00008YJH5|3.0|3 1/2    SR is a little too uneven, especially in the back half, to measure up with the classic status of this fine successor, though still contains plenty of classic numbers itself right from the get go, and thanks mainly to Black's determined subversiveness, remains one of the more inspired alternative rock debuts to date.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|On the surface a crime drama, but to me a meditation on death like Bergman's Seventh Seal with Jamie Foxx as the knight and Tom Cruise as the grim reaper. Life is a battle fought in darkness and shadows but as the end scenes show at least a partial victory is possible. The film's noir atmosphere is beautiful and the plot is entertaining throughout. The actors all hit their parts perfectly. Recommended.
B001R4KQDE|5.0|I loved it on regular DVD but waited to get the special edition because I knew the Blu Ray would eventually come out. Well it was wrth the wait I have the Theatrical version and the special edition . The sound and visual quality are incredible. This is a must buy movie for people that are fans of Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino. Buy it.!!!!
B000002LRX|5.0|When Faith No More went into the making of their second album with Mike Patton on vocals, only two things stayed the same: the line-up and the producer, Matt Wallace, who brought the band's ground-breaking \\"The Real Thing\\" to life. Between albums, Patton had dabbled in his previous outfit, Mr. Bungle, recording an entire album before reconvening with the rest of the band to record what would ultimately be a bizarre but satisfying departure from its predecessor. Rejecting the arena-friendly metal and hard-rock that their touring mates in Metallica and Guns N' Roses promoted at the time, \\"Angel Dust\\" instead indulges in the macabre of metal, leaning on the band's funky side and Patton's strange sense of humor, unwittingly giving birth to a genre and a generation of bands that fit the bill of the much maligned \\"nu-metal\\" era.<br /><br />As the first album with Mike Patton fully integrated into the group, there is a notable shift in direction for the band. In fact, the sound is so drastically different from its predecessor that it alienated guitarist Jim Martin - playing for his last time with the band on this record - to the point where he wasn't even invited to the recent reunion of the band. But whatever the casualty of the band's creativity, it worked for the best. From top to bottom, \\"Angel Dust\\" is a remarkable step up in quality from \\"The Real Thing,\\" and not to mention, not as dated. \\"Caffeine\\" and \\"Midlife Crisis\\" keep the more straight-forward rock intact, with Martin belting out sustained and substantial riffs amidst the A.D.D. afflicted performance by Patton and a groovy rhythm section. Elsewhere, the album takes bolder and quirkier turns. \\"RV\\" is best described as a trailer-trash ballad, with crooning so convincing you forget it's meant as mockery. \\"Be Aggressive\\" tackles subject matter not appropriate for this review and enough to make keyboardist Roddy Bottum blush, featuring back-up vocals by a cheerleading squad. The longer the album goes on, the weirder it gets. \\"J---lobber\\" brings the experimentation full circle, playing almost like an acid trip in prison, while a cover of John Barry's \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" closes the album, dropping you off in a place so far removed from the opening track, \\"Land of Sunshine,\\" that you'll have to play the album back to figure out how you got from point A to point B.<br /><br />Truth be told, \\"Angel Dust\\" is hardly an easy album to appreciate, especially for those mostly acquainted with the band through the likes of \\"Epic\\" or \\"Falling to Pieces.\\" Regardless, it's an album that has surely stood the test of time, never getting old and never failing to entertain. Patton and company seem bound and determined to pull out all the stops to entertain their audience (and perhaps, more importantly, themselves) and what results is a seminal and original album whose influence resonates today. Regardless of where their legacy led them or who they influenced in their wake, Faith No More will always be remembered as the fearless and unapologetic group they were, and nothing is more of a testament to that fact than \\"Angel Dust.\\"r it gets. \\"J---lobber\\" brings the experimentation full circle, playing almost like an acid trip in prison, while a cover of John Barry's \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" closes the album, dropping you off in a place so far removed from the opening track, \\"Land of Sunshine,\\" that you'll have to play the album back to figure out how you got from point A to point B.<br /><br />Truth be told, \\"Angel Dust\\" is hardly an easy album to appreciate, especially for those mostly acquainted with the band through the likes of \\"Epic\\" or \\"Falling to Pieces.\\" Regardless, it's an album that has surely stood the test of time, never getting old and never failing to entertain.

The general storyline  The twists and turns of the plot    What I didn't like:    Jace and Clary were flat at times  The overuse of similies, sometimes they didn't even make sense. I got the feeling that Clare was trying her best to avoid cliche's and ended up with some forced writing    I wasn't going to read the next installment, but in the last 100 pages I changed my mind. I have to know the answers to some of the questions I have, not going to give anything away here.

1905654294|2.0|After completing the \\"Twilight\\" book series im feeling rather flat.  The first book started off with a bang. It has the wow factor that pulls you in. You instantly connect with each character and your instantly pulled under the Bella and Edward spell.      However after reading on, New Moon establisted more of the story, it too grabbed me but left me feeling rather disconnected with Edward.  Jacob comes so much more into his own and you really get to like him.      After reading Breaking Dawn however I feel extremely flat. This was not the ending I was hoping for.   I feel more time was spent on trying to create a drama or obstical for Bella and Edward to overcome. Tho the book does wrap up alot of unanswered questions I ended up feeling very disconnected from Bella and Edward and in the end was left wondering why the story had to go down the Marriage and Kids path?    I feel so much more time should have been spent on Bella becoming a Vampire (in better detail and perhaps that could have been the \\"drama for the final novel) and the love that her and Edward share.     All in all,  im glad iv read it, id read it again but am i happy with the wrap up?  No.
B000ERU6QC|1.0|awful choice if looking for other sources of Hommes' musical generosity. this album performs oral pleasure. unless you are male and forty-something, in need of revisiting your glory days, this is a mistake to own. kyuss, (pre-2006) qotsa, and even the shrooms/alcohol-induced desert sessions leaves this collection of wasted studio time in the dust. i didn't enjoy the music either.

B001KQB2WS|5.0|The book in and of itself was beyond words excellent, but the audio book as read by Michael Maloney (the reader of all the Harry Potter audio books) was incredible.  The combination of excellent writing and an incredible reader created a feeling of involvement and closeness to the characters and story that I've never experienced when listening to an audio book.      The bonus feature at the end is a wonderful dialogue between the editor/publisher, David Fickling, and the author, John Boyne, about the book, its conception, and public reactions.  They also discuss the book's theme and relevance to similar events since WWII in other countries and cultures.  It was wonderfully insightful, and I will recommend we listen to it at book club after our discussion.      Truly a remarkable audio edition of an already excellent book.
0385340575|5.0|Some readers were disappointed by Nothing to Lose.  They have my personal guarantee that they will not be disappointed by Gone Tomorrow.  Jack Reacher is back and he's back with a vengeance.  Literally.  The story opens with Reacher on a northbound NYC subway car, one built in Japan, to specifications which he discusses in detail.  Why?  Because Jack is a curious man and so are the readers who overhear him telling his stories.  He also details the specifications because they will come back to play a role in the story several hundred pages later.  On that car, in the middle of the night, a woman who appears to be a potential suicide bomber does something else instead.  Her action haunts Jack and he does not rest until he knows the reasons for her actions and exacts vengeance on those who have caused those actions.<br /><br />Except for some brief moments in Washington, Gone Tomorrow is set in Manhattan, a city that both Jack Reacher and his creator know very well.  The wide cast of characters includes members of the NYPD, the FBI, miscellaneous defense/homeland security types, some private security forces and some uber-baddies from Turkmenistan.  The plot involves actions from the early 1980's and actions from today's headlines.  The plot is as tight (to adapt one of the novel's similes) as the endpoint of the alimentary canal of a piscine creature.  There is a bit of sex and a great deal of violence (strong but not pornographic).<br /><br />The novel is replete with information, as Child taps into the wellsprings of the techno-thriller.  There is also a great deal of ratiocinative mystery: how can you find someone in NYC in the middle of the night?  How can you deduce the likely behavior of an individual from the scant remaining facts at your disposal?  What are the best moves to employ against two individuals coming at you with brass knuckles?  Why do you need a glove to operate a certain form of automatic weapon?  How do the government's security-system computers operate?<br /><br />This is Lee Child at his best: jackhammer suspense, pages flipping at light speed and Jack Reacher in full-tilt sarcastic mode, with a small army of baddies deserving of the business end of his best skills.  Only one bit of advice: begin it when you have the time to finish it, because that is exactly what you will want to do.  This is primo stuff; don't miss it.is Lee Child at his best: jackhammer suspense, pages flipping at light speed and Jack Reacher in full-tilt sarcastic mode, with a small army of baddies deserving of the business end of his best skills.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|If you love the Southern Vampire series of novels for its light-hearted nature, then you may be put off by HBO's series True Blood.  I purchased this with little knowledge of the show.  I have loved the books though.  HBO's series takes a left turn on a number of areas.  Of course they expand on the characters and take them in different directions that the novels do not, as is typical of book-movie partnerships.  It is also very a very explicit show with lots of sex and gratuitous nudity.  While I'd prefer staying closer to the lighthearted nature of the novel series, the show outside the books is also good in its own right.  I feel as though they try to cram too many outrageous events into one episode, but it keeps things interesting and keeps you interested in the secondary characters. Lovers of the novels may feel that the producers, directors, and writers have taken their favoritie characters to heel in a handbasket, but if you take the show as a stand-alone entity it is still entertaining and enjoyable.
B001PPGAK8|4.0|In the last decade one genre has returned from almost certain death to become one of Hollywood's most lucrative sources of income. That genre is that of the superhero, or comic book genre as it is most commonly referred to as. Several franchises have been successfully established within this revived genre, some standouts would be the `Spider-Man' movies, `Batman' reboot and the `Blade' trilogy. In the midst of all of those, one franchise has stood out from all the others by taking the focus of the comic book film away from being only on a few key characters and onto an entire team of heroes. This set of movies is none other than the `X-Men' franchise.    After two highly successful trips to the box office with \\"X-Men\\" and \\"X2: X-Men United\\", both with Bryan Singer at the helm, the third film \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" would feature a new director. For the third entry in the series, director Brett Ratner (\\"Red Dragon\\") took over for Bryan Singer, who left the series to direct \\"Superman Returns\\". The decision to have Brett Ratner at the helm of such a high profile movie that was to serve as the supposed final chapter in the popular superhero trilogy, caused many a fan to become uneasy. This was caused in part by the fact that Ratner had at one point been picked by Warner Brothers to direct the newest `Superman' movie; however, before much progress could be made he dropped out of the film. So, with a new director onboard that had little to no obvious experience in dealing with elaborate visual effects (not to mention the fact that he couldn't handle one hero let alone a team), and the success of a franchise on the line, one question remained. \\"Could this latest chapter in the `X-Men' series hope to succeed when it seemed that so many factors were working against it?\\"    \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" begins with the creation of a new `cure' for the mutant gene, allowing those born with powers to choose whether they wanted to remain mutants or take the cure and become normal human beings. This `cure' quickly becomes the focus for the mutant race, and serves as the potential catalyst to spark an all-out war that has been brewing between Magneto's (Sir Ian McKellan) `Brotherhood of Mutants' and Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) X-Men. With mutantkind divided as to which side to choose, the battle lines are quickly being drawn, and the final battle is about to begin!    Screenwriter Zak Penn (\\"xXx: State of the Union\\"), taking over for departing writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (who also jumped ship to work on \\"Superman Returns\\"), chose wisely (in my opinion) to not focus on a story dealing solely with the `cure' for mutants. Granted the cure story arc was interesting and provided some very captivating moments between key characters as some felt the cure was a blessing, while others felt it was just another way for humans to oppress the mutants even further. With that being said, I don't feel that this storyline would have been able to sustain the film throughout its entire duration. With that in mind I feel confident in stating that the film greatly benefited from the intermixing of the incredibly popular Phoenix story arc from the comic books. The Phoenix plotline, just as it did in the comics, provided some very intense moments within the story, along with numerous opportunities for the characters to explore how they feel about Jean's miraculous resurrection and her newly unleashed awesome power. This proved especially true for Hugh Jackman's character Wolverine, as he now finds the woman he loves may be a threat to everything else he holds dear.    Many detractors of this film felt that the movie lacked in substance, and that the film would have been better served had it focused solely on Jean Grey becoming the Phoenix. I agree that the film probably would have been even better had it dealt even more, if not solely on Jean's manifestation into the Phoenix. However I must disagree with the first sentiment about the lack of substance. This film was the final act (or at least it appears to be) in a trilogy, meaning that in some way it ties into events that occurred in the previous two films. Therefore, this film is intended more as a means of tying up any and all remaining loose ends left over from its predecessors, while at the same time expanding somewhat on what had been laid out prior to this entry. In the case of \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\", the film's story was focused on exploring what happened to Jean in the closing moments of \\"X2\\", unleashing the war that had been brewing between the two opposing sides of the mutant race, and introducing us to the concept of a cure for mutants. If you ask me, those three aspects of the story provided plenty of substance for this film to draw from, and it did so in a satisfying way that didn't come off as overly bloated and complicated like some third film's in a trilogy have of late (for example, \\"The Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\\").    The cast, as they have been in the previous installments, was still as great as ever; except for a couple of exceptions. Actresses Halle Berry and Anna Paquin appeared to struggle with their characters for some reason in this film. Both of their performances varied between good to being just flat and disinterested in nature. I will say that aside from her performance in \\"X2\\", Halle has been inconsistent with her interpretation of the X-Man known as Storm; however, by this point one would have hoped that she would have figured the character out by now. As for Anna Paquin, I don't really know what the problem was; perhaps it was her character's arc in this film and her insecurity about being a mutant becoming more apparent given the newly discovered cure. Whatever the case may be, she clearly struggled to find a groove in her surprisingly small amount of screen time, given that the character was much more involved in the previous two films, and in the end she delivered what could possibly be classified asthe most uninspired performance in the film. Like I said, aside from these two, the remainder of the returning cast members continued to deliver solid performances, even when relegated to little more than a cameo appearance (I'm referring to James Marsden's character Cyclops).    Joining the returning members, the film featured several newcomers to the series, such as Kelsey Grammer (Beast), Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut) and Ben Foster (Angel), all of whom fit right in, as if they'd been members of the cast since the very first movie. Now, I for one never would have picked Kelsey Grammer (TV's \\"Fraiser\\") to embody the X-Man known as the Beast. Sure he could handle the intellectual dialogue and would sound genuine in doing so, but I wouldn't have thought of him as being all that physical of an actor. However, there he was in some of the fight sequences right in there with the other X-Men, and holding his own without any trouble at all. It's just one more example of how some of the casting choices in Hollywood never cease to amaze me in how spot on they are, despite all appearances to the contrary. Next we have soccer player turned actor Vinnie Jones (\\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\") offering up his portrayal of the powerhouse mutant known as Juggernaut. Juggernaut pretty much did in this film exactly what the character is known for in the comics, essentially decimate anything and everything in his path. The only major difference between the two mediums is that there was no mention ever made to the character being the half-brother to Charles Xavier. Aside from that Vinnie's performance was as good as expected for an actor playing a character that isn't known for being all that much of a thinker or having any real depth to him.    Last but not least, we have actor Ben Foster as the mutant known as Warren Worthington III, a.k.a. Angel. The only thing you can say about Ben, other than the fact that he pretty much knocks every performance out of the park, is that he is a true chameleonwhen it comes to his appearance and presentation from role to role. In one movie he'll have long black hair and an extremely bad attitude (\\"Hostage\\"), then he'll have scraggly red hair, a plethora of piercings, and a heart of gold (\\"The Punisher\\"), or he will be a clean cut, blonde heir to a massive fortune as he is in this film. It's amazing to me to see just how diverse Ben has proven to be in various movies, and each performance is always unique from the one before it. This is one actor who I believe will go down as one of the best and most talented of his generation.    The action scenes in this film are the most intense out of all the `X-Men' movies. Everything is so exciting and fast-paced that you feel like you have to see the movie more than once to fully take it all in. Going hand-in-hand with the action, the special effects work is also the best out of the franchise. Not that the visuals in the first two movies were anything to look down upon. In this film there is one sequence alone, involving the Golden Gate Bridge, that is worth the price of purchasing this movie.    \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" isn't a perfect movie by any means; however, it completely ties up all loose ends while still delivering to us a pulse-pounding battle that had been teased at for the last two films. Despite all the bad press this film has received among some fans, critics and so on, I personally found this installment to be just as entertaining as the first film, and a fitting end to the series.    \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.
B001K3JF7K|3.0|The singing, that is. This isn't a terrible album, but it certainly is missing a je ne sais quoi.    Pros: The classy orchestrations remind me of the classic Sinatra-Jobim collaboration. Diana's Jobim-like single-note piano solos are the essence of wit and understated grace.     Cons: Krall's singing has always been her weak point. Technically, her voice sounds good, but that's the problem. It's technically cool and precise, feathery, light, and on key. But it doesn't really touch me, except on personal material such as that found on The Girl In The Other Room. And some of the quieter material from her Paris concert. I'm not feeling it.     Not only that, Quiet Nights is filled with tempos that are maybe just a bit to slow to begin with, and Diana often sounds like she needs to get some sleep or lay off the 'ludes.     You're My Thrill is almost laughably bad, so ineffective is Krall at generating any kind of heat. Her delivery on So Nice sounds like she's doing a run through of the sheet music for the first time. What was she thinking? Not nice at all. Her slinky singing on Hang My Tears Out To Dry shows a little bit of the impishness and playfulness we see in her smile on the CD cover photo. What went wrong on the other songs, I can't guess.    And the orchestrations do tend to get lush to the point of syrupy or schmaltzy in spots. Part of that is used to good effect, but sometimes it goes overboard.     By contrast, Krall shines on Bacharach's Walk On By and How Can You Mend A Broken Heart by the Brothers Gibb. She sounds engaged here, and the arrangements are well thought out. Those two cuts are so good, it's almost shocking how dull some of the rest is. Corcovado (Quiet Nights) is one of my top ten favorite songs of all time, but Krall sleepwalks through the version on this album.     Well, I'm sorry to say this CD is a step backward in her recorded output. Even as a relaxing cocktail music album it pales by comparison to The Look Of Love -- again, with the exception of the Bacharach and Bee Gees cover tunes.

B000000XCA|5.0|Proud Mary, a song about a riverboat of that name, was the single that established Creedence Clearwater Revival as a force to be reckoned with. It made the top ten in Britain and did even better in America, where it became the first of several Creedence Clearwater Revival singles to reach the top three. Curiously, they eventually had a number one hit in Britain (Bad moon rising, from a later album) but never reached the very top in America, where they were far more popular.<br /><br />Supported by a cover of Good golly Miss Molly, the rock'n'roll classic, and several great original songs including Born on the bayou, Keep on chooglin', Penthouse pauper and Graveyard train, this album laid down a marker. It gave the public a clear message that Creedence Clearwater Revival was different from what had gone before. Although all the members were born in California, the group had absorbed a variety of influences, including some from Louisiana, prior to hitting the big time.<br /><br />While this is not their best original album (that distinction belongs to Cosmo's factory), it provides a fine sampling of Creedence Clearwater Revival's music and all committed fans of the group need this album in their collection.

B001FB55HG|5.0|Terminator Salvation easily defeats Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines in just about every phase possible, but especially in pure action.    Salvtion pays homage over and over to the past Terminator films ranging from the the Guns N' Roses song in T2, to the exact way the Terminator walks up the stairs in T1, and even the nuclear fuel cells in T3.    Christopher Bale is fantastic as John Connor, and a huge step up from the Connor people saw in T3.     Anton Yelchin is dead on in his impression of a young Kyle Reese and Sam Worthington is a name that is surely on the rise with his portrayl of Marcus Wright, a new breed of Terminator.    From the opening scene to the final, Terminator Salvtion is breath-taking, very loud, and very full of action.    The camera work used in Terminator Salvation is amazing, including the helicopter scene in the first 10 minutes of the movie.    Salvation covers the stories of a young and rising through the ranks John Connor, the people's champ, a young Kyle Reese who has no idea how important he is, and Marcus Wright, who last remembers being executed only to find himself in the year 2018, in the land of the Terminators.     I know Terminator Salvation has gotten a bad rap, but most of it came from fans who had a prejudice against McG for being the director, but ignore them and check out Terminator Salvation.    and one more thing, yes Arnold does appear. His appearence doesn't last long, but his impact is definetly made and felt, and Terminator Salvation is sure to do the same.
B002962RKE|5.0|This was a great episode. I will definitely be watching the show. It was clean which is not what I expected. But clean is good.
B001U0HBPG|1.0|I was drawn to see this movie because I actually saw some of the filming of the beach scenes (a one minute clip in this 166 minute film) in the US Virgin Islands.  Yes, that is where this very small snipit was filmed.    I went into this movie with high expectations.  The idea of reverse aging, in theory, seems like it could yield some interesting stories and a unique plot.  But, the entire movie languishes -- think Driving Miss Daisy on \\"slow mode.\\"  While the stories effectively show the spectrum of age and the difficulties one faces along that spectrum, the plot is plain and overly somber.  I understand the philosophical intent of showing what really matters in these character's lives -- swimming the English Channel, getting struck by lightning, and finding love.  But, this point was not made with any flair or with any unique perspective.  For instance, the Benjamin Button character takes on a very shy, quiet personality and his life story is just not that interesting.  He wanders through his life seemingly depressed at his state of being and removing himself from his love for the sole point of making her life better.  While it is a sad romance that he and his \\"normal-age\\" love could not be together because the age reversal created problems, the story makes me feel as though I have gained nothing from seeing it.  What message was in this film?  That life is short and you need to make the best of it.  Or is it that memories, not age, are important.  In either event, the message I took away is why waste your life on this piece of trash film.  If I could reverse time, I certainly would not!    Check out Driving Miss Daisy, Forrest Gump, and the Notebook instead.  You'll see three movies that are much better and more entertaining.

B001FB55HG|2.0|In a bleak future robots turn on their makers and seek to destory all mankind.  It's a great idea: a frightening concept that lingers in the back of our minds in this technologically driven world: Mankind becoming obsolete. Unfortunatly, so are dinosaurs like me, who remember the greatness of the first two films, because this movie is clearly directed at the teen crowd (PG-13).<br /><br />To review, the Terminator had two wonderful entries and then hit a snag  without James Cameron behind the wheel.  Fans were led to believe that this film would alleviate that problem.  I'm here to say it did not.  That being said, if you enjoyed T3 Rise of the Machines go no further with this review.  You will like this newest entry to the Terminator mythos.  However, if you are harkening for a return to what made the first two movies great I'm sad to say this is not your movie.<br /><br />For years I've been wanting to see a Terminator movie set in the future.  When I heard there was one coming out and that John Connor would be played by Christian Bale, like many fans I was stoked. Sadly, this film equates nothing more than another pointless entry to the Terminator saga.  There are several reasons for this.<br /><br />Firstly, Salvation includes yet another Terminator sidekick.  Wow...that is an original idea!(The cyborg sidekick has already been done T2, T3 and the Sarah Connor Chronicals TV series)  This time it is Marcus, an inmate science experiment turned into a cyborg. However, director McG (who sounds like an item of the McDonalds dollar menu) tries to suprise you with the news that Marcus is a Terminator but fails, because we see Marcus donate his body to Cyberdyne systems in the first five minutes.  To make things worse, Marcus ends up being a more interesting character than Bale's Bruce Way.....I mean John Connor.<br /><br />Secondly, the score doesn't sound right.  We all know what the Terminator should sound like.  Brad Fiedel's score in the opening of T2 has a haunting and machine like drone.  Indeed the whole film has a distinct sound.  You know it's Terminator.  He doesn't feel pity or remorse, and he will not stop ever...until you are dead!  Unfortunatly, Danny Elfman's score sounds more Gotham City than bleak post apocalyptic future to me.  That isn't suprising considering Mr. Elfman has done brilliant work scoring Batman related material (Batman 1989 and Batman the Animated Series just to name a few).  However, I found his Terminator score lacking.<br /><br />My third gripe with the film is the disregard for the future established  cannon of the first three films. Immediatly you will notice a total lack of energy weapons both by Terminators and their human counterparts.  Fanboys know that the Terminator endoskeleton is heavily armored.  Yet, everyone is using convential gas operated small arms (AR-15, Shotgun, Beretta 9mm, colt .45 etc).  As Arnold would say in his best Austrian accent...BIG MISTAKE!  After all, flashback sequences in the early films highlight resistance fighters using plasma rifles and energy based weapons to combat the machines.  When Kyle is asked by Sarah in Terminator (1984) \\"Can you stop it\\" he responds, \\"I don't know...with these weapons...I don't know.\\"  So where are the energy weapons?  People will say I'm nitpicking here, but this isn't some minor hiccup.  This is a major major mistake.<br /><br />What happens when you shoot a Terminator with bullets?  Let us review shall we.  Take for example the police station scene in 1984's Terminator.  A lone T-800 walks into a police station and wipes out all the police officers who are shooting him with newsflash...gas operated projectile weapons!  Flash forward to 1991...the Terminator again gets peppered with small arms fire by a swat team and suffers little more than cosmetic damage.  Even in the dreadful T3 this concept is adhered to.  Yet, this film expects us to forget all that and just accept that standard small arms are effective against the machines.  Who made the call on the decision to eliminate plasma weapons?  If big action sequences were all they were going for plasma fire would have looked really cool in this movie.  I can see the teenagers now...wow, look at the pretty lights...ohhhhhhhh!<br /><br />Next on the list of complaints is a crappy CGI Arnold Schwartzenegger cameo.  Yeah, it looks pretty crappy (like a cutscene in a videogame).  I suppose it's better than the rubber faced Arnold cutting out his eyeball in the 84 Terminator but it still looks goofy.  The kids will love it.<br /><br />Everyone looks clean, goodlooking, and all around too happy.  Besides an occasional machine here or there, the future doesn't look so bad.<br />I mean where are the Terminators?  There is only one in L.A.  There are like six in the whole movie, including a five story high Deceptacon from the Tranformers movie (not a joke), and where did the resistance get A-10s, hueys, and submarines? The future doesn't seem bleak enough.<br /><br />Final verdict: The acting is sufficient, but the script is junk, and everyone is too pretty. Atomic holocost doesn't look so bad.  If you wanted to see hundreds of terminators fightning hundreds of soldiers (opening sequence of T2) you won't find it here; there isn't a single large scale battle to be had.  It's better than T-3 but that isn't saying much.  Go to a matinee show if you must see it.  It isn't worth full price.decision to eliminate plasma weapons?

B001FB55HG|3.0|I really, really wished someone else would have written this movie. There were a lot of things wrong with Terminator Salvation, but this is coming from a person who has watched the prior three installments and the television series. To the average young movie watcher who doesn't know the entire cast of characters in John Connor's story, this film will come off as a mediocre sci-fi action thriller with a confusingly weak story.<br /><br />Taking place after a Nuclear blast has wiped out much of the human race, John Connor (now a grizzled war vet) is one of the leaders of a revolutionary underground movement hell bent on taking back the earth from their machine masters. In the first two Terminator movies we are given a bit of history on this John Connor, how he loved people, how his selflessness and bravado was enough to make them forget their fears and fight back against the zerg. What I saw in Christian Bale's version of John Connor was a hardened loner-type, showing little to no emotion aside from the few times he was with his pregnant wife. This version did not feel like the leader we were made to believe led the revolution, he just lacked the sort of charisma that you would expect a guy like that to hold. He did not go through the ranks touching men on their shoulders and giving the fighters that reassuring eye to let them know he has their back... the tiny hints that a viewer looks for to confirm their belief that this man was their saviour, just weren't there. No, John seemed cold, too cold, his decisions were not democratic, his beliefs are dashed aside at a whim and he seems to have no recollection of his youth (Terminaor 2: Judgement Day) when a machine taught him to think and not allow blind hate to cloud his judgement. This John Connor has a deep hate for the machines and it is reinforced by an ancient tape recorder that plays his mother's instructions from the past. This wrong John Connor ruined it movie for me because he is the protagonist, yet his story, visage, and history are so wrong that it was hard to look past him and like the movie.<br /><br />The story of Terminator Salvation felt like the piecing together of three different scripts being that it started out very well and ended up going nowhere fast. In the past movies we were led to believe that Skynet was so advanced and powerful, the only way out for the human race was to send someone back in the past to stop it from even starting. The Skynet we see in this movie is advanced... at building cool machines and motorcycles (that lack any real AI). To recall Arnold's T-800 relentlessly doing detective work and searching for Sarah Connor in the first Terminator to seeing the T-600s in this movie (the obvious future of it all) walking blindly and being outsmarted by children, just didn't make sense whatsoever. Hell the explosions were pretty but I had absolutely no fear of the machine menace that ruled the world. This is not how I felt in the older movies. Remember how hopeless it seemed when the T-1000 chased the Connor family in T2, how it seemed nothing could stop it? It made you say to yourself, \\"damn! How would you deal with 10 of those things if you can't even handle one in this movie!?\\" Well somehow McG and crew forgot this tiny element because the dumb machines and clueless T-600 models are laughably bad at tracking anything.<br /><br />Through all the horrible and forgettable writing that plagued this letdown, the best parts were the scenes with Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) and Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Not so much the chemistry, but the fact that they had the least annoying scenes in the entire thing. The action scenes which had Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and John Connor (Christian Bale) seemed to be full of the most unrealistic coincidences to fall in their favor. The story behind Marcus Wright was probably the most interesting and would have benefited the movie if they delved into his past a bit more. The conflict in screen time between him and Connor did not flow well and it would have been better if they stayed with him and ditched Connor altogether.<br /><br />In closing I will say that Terminator Salvation was pretty but lacking in substance, relevance and ultimately reason. There is nothing to be learned from this one and it neither wraps up the saga nor adds anything to it. The story was a huge waste of time and a disappointment. Moon Bloodgood was deliciously hot though... I will give it that... but only that.ow well and it would have been better if they stayed with him and ditched Connor altogether.

0375703764|1.0|(I realize that this piece of trash has been out for years so just about everyone already knows what they think about it.  This review is less about helping you decide whether or not to read it and more about attacking a house of cards held together with copious amounts of bulls**t \\"infamy\\" and praise unjustly garnered from largely uninteresting people)    Author Mark Z. Danielewski managed to rip off HP Lovecraft, Milorad Pavic, and a slew of other authors and still have the whole thing come off as uninspired postmodern avant garde counter culture drivel.  The concept is great and the central story, The Navidson Report--and it is the central story--is pretty entertaining, though ultimately a let down (the labyrinth/Minotaur references were either complete bulls**t or red herrings meant to mirror the maze itself with labyrinthine storytelling.  Either way, it's lame that there's no monster).  Tom's death is broadcast from a mile away by him being the only character you don't absolutely f***ing despise and the house itself never having any explanation isn't the sign of postmodern innovation; it's the mark of an uncreative immature writer the likes of JJ Abrams (another overrated hipster hack known for creating mysteries but being completely incompetent when it comes to solving them...pretty pathetic).    The endless references, footnotes, appendices and side stories would add layers to the narrative if they worked towards a goal, but HoL has no end message, no central theme, just a sprawling tangle of character studies constellated around a supernatural house that may or may not be reacting to people's psychoses, neuroses and emotions.  And while that in itself is interesting, the (more or less) lack of a monster and fact that the characters never really develop even after Tom and Lude die (especially not that lying b**ch Johnny Truant, to whom I'll get next) reveals a very nihilistic house of cards.  And nihilism is lame.    Early on, Johnny Truant reveals himself as a not-so-trustworthy narrator.  This was no doubt a dim bulb flashing over MZD's shaven head.  In reality, this is a fatal flaw.  There is never a strong counterpoint to his narrative so you never know whether he's lying (unless he tells you, which happens twice outright: the water heater comment towards the beginning and the healing excursion to his doctor friends towards the end that never happened).  It's a cop out to have your narrator lie because it means you can write without consequence or responsibility.  But it's not so bad when you provide someone with a point of view that counters it, someone to trip up the narrator and reveal him/her to be a lying sack of dogs**t.  Well, MZD never provides this because he's a no talent a** clown.  Without a valid counter measure you have no reason to believe anything Johnny Truant's saying and therefore his entire plot thread becomes worthless (redefining the word given his subject matter).  Oh that and the graphic sex is so gratuitous it smacks of what pervy little brats write in their notebooks when they get home from school.    MDZ is a pretentious a**hole.  He wants to be \\"challenging\\" and \\"fresh\\" but when he's not taking his cues from better/more original authors, he's trying to spice up his boring text with the Johnny Truant narrative, a collection of sordid, drug fueled sexual encounters with a string of gorgeous women who CLEARLY aren't the author's self indulgent narcisstic little weasel d*** fantasies.  The graphic sex is appealing only if you have the mind of a 12 year old, a category into which MZD definitely falls.    Basically, if you're a horny, insecure, hipster hack teenager tasked with writing a \\"horror\\" novel (though it is never scary), House of Leaves is what you'll come up with.  I think the author is around 40 by now but a quick read on his artsy fartsy father's imposition of \\"movie nights\\" back when he was a kid explains why this guy hasn't developed past his formative years.  I wouldn't either if I grew up in such a pretentious environment.  He's the kid who everyone picked on in school but never knew it because he was too up his own colon to realize people were being sarcastic about wanting to come over to his house to watch movies with his dad and sister.  It must have been the kind of experience you go to not because you think it'll be fun but because you can't wait to see how bad it'll be.  Snooty arty types have a way of doing that to people. :\    The only reason I finished this thing was because someone recommended it to me and by the time I realized how horrible it was she had told me no one she knew had ever finished it so it became a point of pride: I was going to read every last word of this damned door stop no matter what.  It took me three months.  It was not worth it.    Mark Z. Danielewski is a hipster, a hack, a blight on the literary community and if you like his used toilet paper scribblings (or if you are him), you should consider becoming an hero. ;)

B001TI9N7I|4.0|I really enjoyed this mystery, with all of its layers.  The central character, a mildly autistic (seeming) goth-girl savant, is fascinating.  It's a bit grisly, though, so maybe not for the faint of heart.  The author has a very anti-misogynist message, highlighted by real statistics on violence against women in Sweden. By the way, if you read this and enjoy it, you should check out the website [...]  Steig Larsson died unexpectedly of a massive heart attack shortly after giving the manuscript for this book and two more in the series to a publisher.  He was only 54. He had a partner of 30 years, but they weren't married (this is common in Sweden).  There was no will.  Larsson was estranged from his father and brother, but they've inherited everything.  The woman he chose to spend his life with has received nothing.  It's disgraceful.  The Support Eva website is trying to do something about this.
159102594X|3.0|It took a while for me to get into The Blade Itself. It's not that the story is bad, it's okay, but the writing is a bit off. Not sure if I'll read the next one or not. I did like the main character at least so that's good.

0307408833|1.0|This has to be the worst cookbook ever and I have a lot of cookbooks.  I really wanted to like this, but every recipe was lacking in something.  The cooking times are inaccurate (plan to bake everything for much longer than suggested).  The ingredients are numerous and expensive. I tried several recipes and they were all bad.  The only halfway decent one was the blueberry crumb cake, but that called for way too much lemon extract.  It was very overpowering.  I used the vanilla cupcakes from \\"The Joy of Vegan Baking\\" as the crumb topping instead of the cupcake recipe from this cookbook. Those cupcakes are the only thing that saved the dessert.  I am very annoyed that I wasted my money on this cookbook and urge you to not buy it.
0756405890|1.0|I borrowed it from my brother and even free it wasn't worth it. This book seemed to have a lot of promise in the story but just never really got going. There are some clever ideas here, but the problem is they're only tangentially related to one another. It's almost as if he pulled ideas for three or four different books and mashed them all into a single story. It's a story about a man who's telling his story. It switches back and forth from third person present to first person past. No problems there but it's just messy. Entire chapters and plots are totally irrelevant. Every 50 pages, the author completely pulls the reader out of the story by having the characters do something so stupid as to be ridiculous. The reader begins to stop caring and even in the last pages, it's so anticlimactic as to not be worth the effort. Did this book even have an editor? I don't see how.

B001FB4W0W|2.0|I don't have HBO, so I had to wait for the DVDs to see the show and I was SO excited...until I watched them. I am a HUGE fan of the Southern Vampire books and if you can separate the books from the TV show, then the TV show is good and has potential. If you're already a fan of the novels, then you are probably like me and have a mental image of what the characters look like and how they act...and the actors in the series are NOT them, so you simply can't watch it without comparing it to the books ***SPOILER ALERTS***(especially since Season One is the TV version of book one, \\"Dead Until Dark\\" & leads into book 2 in the final episode when Lafayette is found dead in Andy's car.)  Anna Paquin would not have been who I envisioned as Sookie, and the TV Eric looks nothing like a hunky hulk of a Viking.  The character of Jason is TOTALLY different in the show than in the books.  I don't recall him being a drug addict or LaFayette dealing.  The show is WAY over-sexed, and while the TV Jason does have a nice back-side...well, it's akin to watching soft porn at times.  The book had some nice love scenes and I'm no prude, but leave a LITTLE for the imagination! And didn't Eric kill Long Shadow? When did Bill create an obnoxious teen vampire girl? Tara is BFFs with the Maenad and sleeping with Sam? Jason joins the Church of the Sun (which was supposed to be in Dallas)? I suppose I don't see why so many major changes had to be made to a best-selling and excellent story line and cast of characters. Had I not read the books before watching the series, I would have been hooked (or bitten) as the case may be. As it stands, my husband refuses to watch it with me because I'm always yelling at the TV, \\"That's not how it happened!  WTF?!?!\\"  That being said, the theme song is awesome and I highly recommend downloading it on iTunes. As for the series, either DVR it or rent on Netflix, but save your money buying it and read the books instead. I'll watch season 2, just because now I want to see what else they'll do to further whore my fave vampire series.  It's like watching a train wreck, it's awful, but you can't stop looking.  I just hope Ms. Harris doesn't start molding the books to fit the show.
B001PJ7TUE|3.0|It's rather infuriating that, en masse, the million & one \\"lifelong Prodigy fans\\" have come out of the woodwork to call this album a masterpiece.  Because at best, this effort is just a really good party album, one that takes few brain cells to process and makes you none the wiser after it's last note rings out.  The musicality is Liam's weakest yet and yes, even compared next to AONO, it falls short [go back and give a listen].  Like most band's musical journeys thru time, each of the follow up albums to the first was a half-step behind its predecessor in quality.  Unfortunately for us, IMD doesn't stray from this knuckle dragging, dumbing down formula.    Omen is the obvious standout here, and the top notch production blows all other contenders from IMD out of the pond.  But the tracks go downhill after the first half, and one has to seriously question the intentions of the finale, Stand Up.  Of course we still want to hear melodic, non-rock, brain candy music from you... but is this safe & barely mediocre effort any way to make a final statement?    It was a bold but necessary step for Liam to create AONO on his own, without being dragged down further by the non-essential boys, and it paid off the best it could for that 4th album.  Bringing them back now to rehash the same scratchy, uninspired vocals of yore just seems... very dated.  No-one likes an old punk rocker nor revels in his dance.  Youth is as youth does, and it's somewhat embarrassing to see these two guys turned into clowns with their fading tattoos and receding mohawks.    Keep the party going fellas, just make it more cerebral next time.    dUb
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a great movie! My husband has been wanting it for a long time and now that we have Blu-ray he was so excited to see it. Our 2 year old daughter even likes watching all of the animals. We just have to distract during the eatings.
B001P9KR8U|2.0|I was really suprised that this movie won the Academy Award for best picture..After watching Slumdog just recently & comparing it to the other nominated movies this year that i did see like The Reader & Milk,Slumdog was extremely overated.I believe that the Academy got it wrong this time,they gave in to all the hype.To me the story of slumdog is a good story about the human condition in India but falls short of a classic movie that i would want to see again.

I'll keep it short    Picture Quality- Excellent, didn't noticed any grainy, artifact image on my LCD tv.    Sound- the sound is good but i noticed dialogue is really low comparing to the rest of the special sound effects. I tested my speakers with other movies and sounds good so is not a spkr problem.    Story- the story is really great, involving love, hate, vengeance.. you name it.

B000GFLEAY|5.0|I just ordered this disc in HD DVD after reading rave reviews of its visual and sonic quality in HiDef Digest. The movie itself I've seen once in the theater and its one of those few family gems that everyone can enjoy. Director Gary Ross(Pleasantville)achieves the right amount of tone to this Depression era tale of a horse who is rescued from the slaughter house and becomes a champion.  A steller cast including Tobey Mcguire, Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and an hilarious William H. Macy as a radio reporter add luster to this tale which is even better than the 1947 version with Shirley Temple and Barry Fitzgerald.  Also the price on HD DVD at a little over $4 is a bargain when you consider that in Blu-ray this disc is over $20!!
B000001FHV|5.0|I disagree with the thought that they sold out to grunge... This shows a dab of all the Genres these guys could have mastered...wether it be Folk/Rock, Blue-grass, Blues & Rock, or grunge... they show on this record how to divide it and bring it together very well. The Meat Puppets create a great set of songs on this Album and inspire you to listen all the way through. The first three songs are just a perfect mix of Folk/Rock/ Blues/ grunge, yet each very distinct. If you listen to \\"Meat Puppets II\\" as a stand alone Album, just remember that they didn't make a Album that sounded like it again, the same for this great Album.<br /><br />I guess thats why I like to listen to Kirk, he seems pointless at times and his many roaming ideas of song-writing may seem like he is a bit of a Dilettante, but those songs make you really ponder music. If you like to be surprised then prepare to be: It's just like Forest Gump's mom said, \\"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your going to get.\\"<br /><br />~ yes it is that simple.

B001VB8UAE|4.0|As someone who's been a fan of Ms. Streisand for a significant number of years, what I've come to appreciate about her is the consistent quality but striking difference between each of her live shows.  Her latest effort, so well documented on this DVD, continues that tradition.  I saw this show at the Boston venue, but have really enjoyed re-living it and discovering new elements in the south Florida program.  Barbra seems so much more relaxed and at ease, no longer relying on over-the-top technological innovations like the past 2 concerts and instead, offering a host of rarely heard or never-before-performed songs that really showcase her talents.  Audience connection and interaction seems to be at an all-time high as well!  No longer is she only connecting with her celebrity friends or high-profile family, but actually dialoguing with fans seated throughout the arena.  And seeing her seem to completely \\"let go\\" and high-kick throughout one section of \\"Don't Rain On My Parade\\" is completey priceless.  (As is her short version of \\"Stoney End.\\"  Don't miss it!)
B001FB55HG|2.0|John Connor's character, and the entire movie, is built around the idea that human compassion and love is what makes us better than the machines.  The hybrid Terminator played by Sam Worthington saves John Connor and Kyle Reese from death.  John Connor is mortally wounded and needs a heart.  The hybrid Terminator has a human heart, and offers it to John Connor.  Connor accepts the heart, presumably leading to the death of the hybrid.  This one scene ruined the entire movie for me, and made a lie out of John Connor's entire ethos.  The John Connor I know would not take the life of another human to save his own.    The movie lacked the nerve racking suspense of the first two that left you exhausted.  It was very predictable, and most of the movie I felt like I was watching Transformers 3, not Terminator 4.  The director McG just does not get the Terminator Universe.  I hope he Will Not be Back.

1591841992|5.0|Dan Roam shows how to take an immensely complicated problem, break it down into constituent parts, explain how things work, identify what is missing, and develop an elegant solution.<br /><br />An important part of the process involves sketching pictures, because pictures can represent complex concepts and summarize vast sets of information in ways that are easy to see and understand.<br /><br />Roam presents a case study of a software business facing declining sales. Across six chapters he applies a different visual framework for approaching the problem. He applies the 6 'W' questions we were taught to ask in journalism class, and then walks us through a visual imagination activation tool he calls SQVID, a series of 5 questions that brings an initial idea to visual clarity and to refine its focus.<br />Combining the six `W' questions and the 5 imagination-focusing SQVID questions creates a powerful analytical tool. Before we know it, solutions begin to appear on the page.
006135323X|5.0|In my opinion, this book is not for academics--it's for average people who are interested in why humans act the way they do. If you're looking for something more highbrow, there are probably other books for you.     I was fascinated by the studies that demonstrate our irrationality. The author not only offers his explanation of why we act irrationally, but he also suggests ways to deal with our odd impulses (procrastination, grabbing anything labeled \\"free,\\" etc.). I loved the book and plan to read it again.
0393061310|5.0|This book has the amazing ability to explain the history of human societal development. It does not provide prescriptions for the future, but does an excellent job of helping to understand the past. A masterpiece of historical analysis and sure to become a classic.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|I LOVE this CD. It is great and the DVD is good too. I like the way they tie in all the musicians voices and locales. I saw the video on the net of the song Stand By Me which prompted me to look and see if the CD was out yet. It was and I ordered it immediately. I play it all the time and it's good road music.
0765318741|5.0|I still haven't seen the movie, and from what I've heard about it's departure from the book that inspired it, I'm not in a particular rush, either. However, as a lifetime fan of horror as well as a writer and editor of dark fiction, I've felt like somewhat of an outsider when my colleagues mentioned this book. I was able to remedy this condition by picking up a copy of the book at a Dallas Target store while distracting myself from the financial pain of a mother-daughter shopping event.<br /><br />I took as much joy in reading this 50's horror story as I do when reading classic sci-fi and fantasy; I've read bits and pieces of classic horror, but while I've had to strain to get through a few other famous notables, I ripped through I Am Legend as readily as the latest King or Koontz. I can see why it's so commonly listed a favorite and influential vampire novel. It's also refreshing to finally read this as a fan of Vincent Price's movie, Last Man on Earth, which was inspired by I Am Legend.<br /><br />I feel fortunate to have stumbled across the edition I did; it contains a clutch of Matheson's short stories as well as the title story. As good as the novella itself was, I like the short stories even better. I won't discuss them at length, as I can't discuss them in a useful manner without spoiling them. But they're good. I'll definitely be reading more Matheson, and I'm sorry I didn't get into him before.
B0000793WW|5.0|This album is thick with ideas (lyrically, musically, production-wise, track sequencing). It nostalgically details a relationship/country strained to the breaking point by the album's largest theme, miscommunication and so well expresses the profound regret it causes. This album sits next to Kid A for me because I forget myself listening to them. They both have a unique sonic imprint and exist in a world of their own. Particularly cool is the reference to / sampling from the The Conet Project (most notably in Poor Places), to give an expansive feeling to the misunderstood, frustrating emotional distance between two lovers uncertain about their destiny. All of the unsettling doubt and tension that has been simmering beneath their skin the entire album is expressed audibly with an escalating frequency-scrambling noise build-up that the shortwave call sign \\"Yankee, Hotel, Foxtrot.\\" eventually becomes lost in. Then all of the sudden, with \\"Reservations\\" you're floating in a singularly human moment of absolute clarity that has expelled all of their insecurities and fears. After such a lyrically complex journey, \\"I've got reservations about so many things, but not about you\\" is to me such a brilliantly simple way of simultaneously acknowledging the weight of all a couple's problems and everything that burdens them while rendering them powerless. It's just such a beautiful offering of devotion, after an album of so much emotional confliction.
1603090002|3.0|Century: 1910 is the third volume of Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's much-lauded League of Extraordinary Gentlemen series. Mina Murray and the (alleged) son of Allan Quatermain are joined by a new group of literary characters: thieving Raffles, occultist Carnacki and gender-bending Orlando. They're on a quest to unearth the secret plot of a clandestine occult group.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Captain Nemo is on his deathbed. After he argues with his young daughter, Janni, about taking over the family business (aka piracy aboard the Nautilus), she takes off for England and begins working as a barmaid under an assumed name. When this change of lifestyle yields less than acceptable results, she summons the Nautilus to come for her and the pirate crew, led by Janni, come face to face with the New League.<br /><br />Then they fight, make up and part ways and the book ends.<br /><br />This was a bit of a pain in the rear, until further research into the matter led me to discover that 1910 is merely the lead-in to two more volumes of League set to take place later in the 1900's. While I do enjoy Moore's literary mash-up concept (I also ordered a hardcover edition of Lost Girls that ships in about a month), these characters are just not as appealing as the original group. Quatermain doesn't do anything adventuresome, Mina doesn't vamp-out and Carnacki and Raffles are dry. The only lively characters in the book are Orlando (who is `more than friends' with both Murray and Quatermain, though it's only implied in this volume) and Janni (who was created by Moore for this book and has no basis in literature that I know of). The book is saved solely by those two characters, O'Neill's gorgeous, detailed art and the sometimes somber sometimes humorous musical styling of two minor cast members, a whore and a murderer.<br /><br />Still, lukewarm Moore is better than alot of other writers' best efforts and O'Neill's good as ever. I'll be picking up the next volume for sure. 7/10 and high hopes for future additions.es for future additions.
0803731094|5.0|[[ASIN:0803731094 The Gruffalo (Picture Books)]] This is without a doubt my favorite childrens book. I have been searching for 5 years to find it then someone said have you tried Amazon.com and low and behold they had it.  The story flows beautifully and the illustrations are incredible.  They are so brightly colored and children love them. It's a book that kids will pick up and look at even though they can't read yet. I used it with autistic children and when I read it I used different voices like how I thought that animal would sound if it spoke and the kids were mezmerized. I recommend this for every childs book collection, it will be their favorite for life.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|First, let me say that I'm a big fan of the Terminator series.  I'm also a very technical person (a real, live, computer engineer) with a lot of A/V experience.  For those of you that are into this sort of thing, I also happen to have some experience in neural network technology, but that's another story.    That said, I was really looking forward to watching the HD version of the Director's cut of T2 before going to the theater this weekend to see the new Terminator Salvation movie.  My son, now 14, had never seen any of the Terminator movies, and had only occasionally watched bits and pieces of the Terminator: Sarah Conner chronicles, so we started out by watching the original Terminator BD earlier this week.  Given that the original was made in 1982, the BD version, played in full HD and 5.1 THX surround, was a great (re-)introduction to the series.    My wife had ordered the T2 SkyNet Edition BD in April, and we were happily surprised to have it arrive in the mail from Amazon on the very day that the new Terminator movie was released in the US.  I removed it from the box, inserted it into my Sony BDP-S300 player, and then waited for it to boot...    As others have already noted here, we waited... and waited... and waited.  It took fully 3 minutes to complete the preliminary loading (a bit long, but not outrageous for a BD HD movie on our player), then the screen went dark for another 2 minutes.  At that point, we got the secondary loading message from \\"SkyNet\\", indicating that it had found a Blu-Ray Profile 1.x player, and that menu's would run in full animation mode [to access all content, a Blu-Ray Profile 2.0 player with internet access was recommended].  This secondary load screen remained visible for another 4 minutes, then the screen went dark again.    No audio, no video.  Nothing.  We waited another 5 minutes, then started pushing buttons on the remote.  The Menu command activated the drop-down, top-level menu for the BD, which allowed us to select options and settings for the play-back.  We selected the Directors Cut, and as soon as we did, the menu disappeared and we went back to the black screen for another 30-40 seconds.    Then, out of nowhere, the LionsGate splash screen appeared, and played in full THX surround-sound for a grand total of 23 seconds.  Then nothing.  Back to black, no audio, no video, and the BD player indicating that the track counter, and playback, had stopped.  Pressing the Play button on the remote momentarily caused the BD Player to switch back into play mode, but still nothing.    We went through this same exercise three more times, each time selecting different options from the top-level menu, trying to get it to play something.  Anything!  Unfortunately, every attempt ended the same way.    Based on the feedback others have provided here, I strongly believe that this is an error in the design of the T2/SNE BD-ROM.  I've (both before, and since) successfully played other BD movies on the same player, including the original Terminator and - just to test the player - my Ironman BD movie.  Everything works but T2/SNE.    Again, my player is a two-year old Sony BDP-S300 profile 1.0 BD player, with no ethernet port available.  So, I have no option of updating firmware on the player, nor do I have any option of utilizing the BD-Live features supposedly offered on the T2/SNE disc.    As I won't be spending another $300 to buy a new player to watch this movie in HD, I will be returning the BD-ROM to Amazon for a refund, and my family and I will happily enjoy the Director's cut of the film on up-converted DVD tonight.    My advice to the average consumer of this BD would be: if you don't have the absolute latest in BD player technology, avoid this BD at all costs.  Stick with the Extreme version of the T2 DVD.  It upconverts to full HD with only moderate graininess and plays full THX 5.1 surround sound without any issues whatsoever.
0446402397|3.0|The first 300 pages were informative about life in Russia under Stalin and captured my interest. My enthusiasm declined during next 100 pages and the  last 100 pages were dreadful, full of ridiculous predicaments and very  far-fetched solutions.
B001437DMA|3.0|I'll start with the obligatory statement of \\"I am a huge Joe Satriani fan.\\"  I have everything he has ever released. However, this album almost never makes it into my CD player.  None of the songs have a catchy hook. The slower songs don't really reach the 'touching' levels of Always With Me, Always With You or Ten Words, or other slow Satch songs.  Don't get me wrong, for Satriani fans, it is acceptable - just not great.  His playing is great as always, I just wish he would go in another direction.  Revelation is decent, I suppose.  But \\"I Just Wanna Rock?\\"  I thought Crowd Chant shallow, now I see an even worse effort in that one.  I suggest purchasing almost any other of his entries (except the bad ones mentioned above) or wait for his new project Chickenfoot.
B001B7CNY2|1.0|I'm really frustrated with this thing.  How do I get that \\"Bonus Disk\\" icon off the upper left of the screen???  I don't want alternate views.  I don't want commentaries.  I don't want WW2 vintage films in a little box.  I just want to eat my popcorn and watch my movie.  If I wanted little extras on the screen, I'd watch TBS or Sci-Fi channel.
B001EYU1VO|5.0|Shipping:  Shipping was great. I actually got it in exactly 48 hours via UPS.    Packaging:  When you first get the device, it will be easy to set up ( I won't spoil the assembly for you if you haven't seen it before ). I was really impressed with the packaging for starters.     Software:  I installed the drivers ; quick and easy. I didn't install anything additional but that's up to you. I'm using a iMac (2008) with windows vista ( not sure anymore what level ).    Hardware:  I use this stick with Flight Simulator X. At first the stick was uncomfortable for my hand.  I had to adjust it , which it then became a perfect fit. If you're worried about force feedback, don't. My logitech stick's FF motor died after maybe a year  of use. The spring which hold it center and provides a force is good enough.     What I was most excited about but a tad bit disappointed by was the throttle ( more so with FS X than the stick it self ) . It's a dual throttle which can also become single throttle isn't able to control individual engines. They both control all engines whether or not you use one or both. There is also a button that will join the two throttles.    You also have  lot of options when it comes to buttons. I actually have less use for my keyboard now that I can put those commands on the stick. There are 10 number keys, a \\"shift\\" key , a trigger and dual throttles. The book says you can assign them to commands such as the trim and different engines but you'll have to play around with that in the game you're using it with.    The base can be folded and be put behind your monitor if you have a flat screen LCD monitor to save space. The over all texture and stainless steal of the device is very smooth.    There is a light under the hat switch which can become distracting at times when you push the stick forward during flight. The light for some reason is very intense on that angle so don't look directly into it.    Another thing is when you're pushing the stick forward,the base lifts up. I personally do not mind when flying because the only time I'm really pushing the stick forward is when I'm landing. Even then, I don't even push that hard for the stick to really lift. I only notice that when I'm flying freehand. It might bother some but it's fine with me.      Final:  I would suggest this to anyone who is interested in an adjustable stick, great over all feel and style. Of course there are more advanced sticks around but this certainly is worth the buy for what it offers.    Good:  Easy to instal drivers  Great feel ( texture )  Adjustable  Great Style  Lots of buttons  Space saver    Bad:  Intense blue light  Lifts when pushing stick forward
B000002I8D|4.0|Phil Collins has had an interesting career.  Coming in for Genesis' third album to be the drummer, he then went on to become the lead vocalist after Peter Gabriel left.  He also joined the Fusion group Brand X while in Genesis.  In 1981 he launched his successful solo career with this album, \\"Face Value\\".  He has even had a small acting career to go along with his career in music.  Far from one expects from a star, at least in the way he looks, one has to respect his career and what he has accomplished.  This first album from him very much fits his career.  There is an iconic song, some puzzling song choices and some hidden gems as well.      The album opens with \\"In the Air Tonight\\", a piece which has staying power as we near 30 years later, and with no end in sight, nor would one expect there to be.  It is a simple piece, and yet masterful in the way it is executed.  I suppose it didn't hurt that it spawned an urban legend about its origins either, but it would still be with us even if that had not happened.  Next up is \\"This Must be Love\\", a nice pleasant piece but one which is easily forgotten after the opener.  Next comes an odd choice as Phil chooses to cover \\"Behind the Lines\\", a Genesis song which had originally been released less than a year before on the \\"Duke\\" album.  It is a different version, but it seems like a strange thing to do.  \\"The Roof Is Leaking\\" is the next track, a nice track which has a different feel than the first pieces, with Phil on piano, and it blends well into two instrumentals (though with voices as instruments) called \\"Droned\\" and \\"Hand in Hand\\", which closes out the first half of the album.    \\"I Missed Again\\" opens the second half of the album, once again a decent piece but not a classic, which made the top 20 as a single.  Next up is a nice slower piece titled \\"You Know What I Mean\\", which is one of the pieces which I would call a hidden gem, along with the following piece \\"Thunder and Lightning\\" which is a faster and more upbeatsong.  \\"I'm Not Moving\\" is an interesting piece and provides some more diversity to an already diverse album.  \\"If Leaving Me Is Easy\\" is another slower piece, but in this case the slowness tends to drag on a bit.  \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is another one of the odd choices.  It is certainly different from \\"The Beatles\\" version, but at the same time Phil's version isn't enough different to justify doing the cover, at least in my opinion.    The result is an album which has some great high points, but there are tracks here which one could well do without.  Nevertheless, this is a classic album, and represents Phil's career quite well.  He has always been one to perform, no matter the genre and that diversity comes through on this album, though certainly some styles are more prevalent than others.
B000J10EQU|3.0|I am still a fan of Chrirtopher Reeve. Although this was a good attempt at ressurecting the series, it was still missing the action the the older movies had.
0439023483|2.0|I must disagree with the glowing reviews this novel has received.  As much as I loved The Underland Chronicles, I didn't like this one.    First of all, it is written in the present tense. I know authors sometimes do this to give a \\"sense of immediacy\\", but I'd far rather have the story written compellingly enough not to need to use this crutch.  So, to me it was just an irritating gimmick.    Furthermore, having the protagonist narrate from moment-to-moment stifled character development.  The author tried to work around that problem with some flashbacks, but even those were put in the present tense.  Also, the ending is given away by the fact that it is in first person: the narrator cannot die because she is around to do the narrating.  Perhaps Collins' thought that writing in present tense would solve that weakness of first person narration inevitably revealing that the narrating character cannot die, but I was not able to suspend my disbelief quite that much.    I found the premise to be cliched:  a dystopian society in which coming-of-age rituals have been turned into something sadistic.  While used effectively in \\"The Tripod\\" trilogy, in this story the device didn't work as well for me.  If the bottom age range of those whose names were placed in hazard were a couple of years older, this might have been more plausible.  But, as it stands, I found that the premise was stretching it.    So, overall this novel was a major disappointment.  I hope that Suzanne Collins' future endeavors will surpass The Underland Chronicles, but for me this wasn't the project that will do so.  Had I not read and loved her previous novels, I would have considered the writer of The Hunger Games to be an amateur.    I will give the novel the small credit it deserves for being just interesting enough to cause me to finish reading it.  However, I won't be reading the future installments in this series.    The one redeeming value of the book was the character Peeta.  I really did like him.It is too bad that the first person present tense narration so greatly limited Collins' freedom to explore this character.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I love the idea behind this story. It's one of my favorites. Will Ferrel shines in this. I wish he'd do more movies like this and less extreme comedy.
0525478183|4.0|highly recommended, but be prepared to take the good with the bad if you enter this author's idealized world. i don't think anyone else writes as shamelessly about fantasies of what they wish their (teenage) life was like as John Green, and as inspiring as it is at times, a lot of what he attempts falls cringingly flat as though it really was written by a teen.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|When I first saw Lost in Austen advertised, I knew that I had to have it. I am delighted with the DVD. It is charming and so fun! I tell all my friends about just how much fun it is! Thanks for carrying it. I love all the twists and turns that it takes with my favorite Pride and Prejudice.
B001TI9N7I|3.0|While I found the actual writing rather pedestrian and disagree with the reviewer who felt the writing was literary, I was engaged by the story and finished the book in two reading sessions.<br /><br />The most interesting character was Salander and I liked the way the author brought her story and Blomkvist's story together, but felt a little let down by Salander's reaction to the events at the end.<br /><br />Despite giving this story only 3 stars (because I'm a sucker for wonderful writing and this story, while competently written, didn't speak to me), it's a worthwhile and entertaining read.<br /><br />I have the second of the trilogy and plan on getting the third.
0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell has given us another page turner. After The Tipping Point and Blink, I for one have come to expect a lot from him. The writing is better than in his previous books. The book is written as a series of essays on remarkable people. He asks the question, \\"How did these people become remarkable?\\" In most cases, the answers are surprising. Rather than dismiss success as a matter of great, unusual ability, Gladwell digs in a little deeper. He proposes, pretty convincingly, that there is much more to success than unusual ability. He shows that it is often rooted in cultural background and temporal events (eg being born in the \\"right\\" year).<br /><br />Those seeking success in this life might find the book both encouraging and discouraging. It's encouraging in that success does not always depend on unusual talent or abilities. It's discouraging in that success may, very often anyway, depend on factors well beyond our control. I didn't agree with all of his conclusions, but his research is undeniably captivating. This is an engaging book that will challenge your thinking.
0719561027|5.0|This is still a book I would recommended to my friends...alright it's a fiction read...it still is a great read.
0375842209|5.0|The writing is unparallel.  Creative and fearless work of art.  Why oh why can't more authors write like this??  Best book I've read since Catch 22.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd never dissapoint with any of their studio efforts, and The Wall is no exception. As it follows a chronological storyline, there are of course some tracks that don't stand up as well on their own, but if you listen to the entire album straight through (as the Floyd would have intended) then you can't help but be amazed by the stylistic genius and musical intensity employed on The Wall. It is however, Roger Waters' thoughtful lyrics and intruigingly sinister plot that really make this album worth listening to. IMO this is the best rock opera since The Who's \\"Tommy\\", and it impresses on even more flamboyant terms.

1416550542|5.0|I really enjoyed this well-written novel, The Forgotten Garden, by Kate Morton. While not exactly a quick read or a page turner, I seemed to fly through the 500 plus pages wanting to know how little Nell came to be alone on the docks. It is a rich tale set in Australia and England, full of mystery, and fairy tales. I lent it to my mom who enjoyed it even more than I did. We look forward to reading more works by Kate Morton.
B001P3SA94|5.0|Saw it first at the theatre, but knew that I would want to not only see it over and over again, but share it too.  Just wonderful...I was dancing in my seat, then up on the floor!
B000OPOAM0|5.0|THE TERMINATOR has become a classic; an iconic piece of movie history.  This is the movie that made the Govenator a star.  Part sci-fi time travel drama, part blood and guts shoot `em up, part action-adventure, THE TERMINATOR stands the test of time and remains a favorite in the hearts of its fans.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger became a household name playing THE TERMINATOR, a killer cyborg from the future whose sole mission is to kill Sarah Connor.  His performance as the merciless, unstoppable killer is chilling.  This is the first movie in which he wore clothes for the majority of the film, and where he uttered what is arguably his most famous line \\"I'll be back.\\" (Admittedly, he only had 18 lines!) Linda Hamilton is terrific as Sarah Connor, a young woman who is stronger than she thinks and is able to overcome incalculable odds.  The special effects are excellent, especially for 1984, and they still look great today.<br /><br />I just plain like this movie.  I remember seeing it in the theatres in 1984, and being blown away.  And I still enjoy it after all these years.  I showed THE TERMINATOR to my 12 year old daughter a few days ago, and she thought that it was \\"pretty cool,\\" too.  High praise coming from a tween!
031606792X|2.0|I waited months to write this review, as I was waiting to my thoughts on it settle down because maybe I was mistaken. While reading it, I was feeling so annoyed like it was all wrong.<br />But after reading some other books and giving it some time, it still bothers me.<br />I really liked the series, but the last book had me almost disliking the other three. I still don't know what passed in the writer's mind to publish something like this.<br />Characters were drastically changed, story lines were destroyed. Even though it's all fiction and fantasy, it just dind't make any sense anymore. It was upside down, disgusting.<br />Edward's lovely personality is gone. So is Charlie's, Jacob's, Alice's, and even Rosalie's.<br />Bella got stronger and saved the day, but hello, this is no fairy tale.<br />To sum up, it's a whole different book with different characters, and I can't even get started with the baby Renesmee. Alien meets Rosemary's baby, it was like a really bad comedy or a bad horror movie.<br />Well, it's not even a history. It didn't make any sense.<br />I have to say Mrs. Meyer blew it.
B001GCUO16|5.0|We get to see rad movies like this!  I freakin love it.  If you like comic book movies go see this one, its awesome!  they could have had a few more characters play a bigger part, but I loved it, from beggining to end.  Excelent.  Wolverine is rad,
B002962RKE|4.0|There's humor, social conflict, and lots of eye candy.  This show has a lot of potential!
B00006NSGX|5.0|This is just a fantastic set of music.  If you even think you like Clapton, in my opinion, you have to get this CD.  It's just wonderful.  Great variety of stuff - classic Clapton, some of his newer stuff, some great blues, etc.  The cuts that really stand out for me are \\"She's Gone\\", \\"I Want A Little Girl\\" (I went and got the Ray Charles version after I heard the version on this CD), \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman\\", \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", I could go on...........  \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman\\" really really smokes.  The organ section on this song is fantastic.
B001UE276A|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend. My friend received the gift really fast and in perfect condition. Very satisfied.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|This series is by far the Best HBO has ever made. It looks and sounds fantastic in Bluray.The packaging is compact and colorful. The discs are a bit difficult to get out of the sleeve (a small price to pay for a masterpiece such as this).  Lots of great extras & features.
0691131511|3.0|I'm a lifelong student of Byzantine history but was a somewhat disappointed by this book.  It seemed a little unfocused to me and bounced around without much organization.<br /><br />To be fair, I prefer a more linear telling of history, but I also love books of essays. This definitely leaned more to the latter than the former, and I found myself losing interest halfway through many chapters.  I can only feel sorry for those poor workers to whom this book is allegedly directed.  I will say that certain sections did take off, especially her comments about Anna Komnene.  But overall, a slight disappointment.<br /><br />I'm a tough grader, so I said three stars for average, although I'd probably say it was slightly above average.
0143038419|5.0|I enjoyed E/P/L immensely. Sure, there were slow spots, but overall it was humorous, hopeful, inspiring and thoroughly worth the price of admission.    Gilbert's voice is refreshing, intelligent and very honest. I don't know if I could have exposed myself so thoroughly to the public as she did in this book.    A great read!
B000QXDED6|1.0|300 the movie will not be on the list of movies I want to waste my money on and I encourage others not to spend their hard-earned money on that too. The truth is that Spartan society left nothing behind but stories of its vicious battles. No art, no knowledge, no invention, nothing to enlighten the future men came from Sparta- only the clash of arms and violence. Sparta was overwhelmed in the end by an outside world Spartans couldn't even begin to understand because of their culture's innate xenophobia and hatred. That so-called Spartan courage had no impact on the Persian army. The Persians took losses, but kept right on down the Greek coast to Athens and burned it in one piece. What stopped the Persians was the subterfuge of Themistocles and the Athenian navy at the naval battle of Salamis which was quite a small loss for Persia.<br /><br />  As for \\"the whole of Spartan society,\\" what else is there to say? Sparta was a totalitarian and aristocrat community well over 20 centuries before the term was even invented, suppressing a vast helotry. (It also systematized homosexuality to a degree unknown in any other society) And, again, it created nothing to enlighten men who would come after- which is exactly what is meant by culture, no?
B001DJ7PR8|1.0|What a terrible film!  The only thing interesting about it is Mr. Allen's delusion that people would ever want to see it.  Empty-headed, narcissistic, idle robot-actors mimicing what Allen takes to be universal angst. Suggest you get back on the couch for a mental health tune-up, Woody! NO redeeming features...not even Barcelona itself.    Run, do not walk, away, and don't look back at this boring mess.
B000001ZS4|5.0|Along with 'Oxygene,' 'Equinoxe' is by far one of the more accessible & well conceived album of the genre. For anyone interested in music technology & sound design, this is a must.    Jean Michel Jarre demonstrates through this album that technology & artistry are not separate entities but rather inseparable counterparts. His mastery in composition & orchestration is clearly shown in 'Equinoxe' as so many of classic analog synths come together laying out new sonic landscape previously unknown.    Now we take the electronic sounds/instruments for granted. But anyone who has studied the history & development of these instruments & musical genre understands the talent it takes to make it become so accessible and to alter the course of music history altogether. Well, JMJ clearly has done just that with 'Equinoxe' as his musical talent comes through in his melodic writings while his knowledge of technology enabled him to sculpt otherwise rather cold electronic sound to come through in such an organic fashion.
B001ED7C58|5.0|We love this soundrack, I say we because my 6 year old loves it as well!! There are so many great singers on the soundtrack. I have to put it on numer one everyday because that is my sons fave!! Its the song they use for the baseball scene in the movie, This is a must buy for your Twilight collection!!

I am not coordinated at all and I had no trouble keeping up with Jillian and her girls.  The moves are easy to learn.  I like that there are 3 different levels.  I have done 10 workouts at level one and 4 at level two, and I can already see results.  I haven't lost any pounds but I have lost a few inches.  I can really see a difference in my stomach and thighs!  I love this DVD!!!

B001ED7C58|1.0|Weak soundtrack - one of the weakest ever. Middle of the road indie crap. I expected a lot more nuance. Hopefully it'll get better.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Awesome show with a lot of very light and funny moments mixed in with dark and frightening moments.  Many twists and turns as you watch the lead character Walt, concerned family man morph into an almost psychopathic meth dealer.  There are a couple of holes in the writing which make you draw your own conclusions, but I think that is from the budget of AMC and the limit on amount of shows.  This would be Soprano-esque had HBO picked it up to develop.  Well worth the price!!!
B001FB55HG|3.0|Terminator Salvation gave me a lot of what I was looking for, just not all of it. I won't worry too much about \\"spoilers\\" since if you've seen a commercial or even the toy isle you probably know about any \\"twists\\" already.<br /><br />A lot of what I was looking for was action and there is plenty of well done action here. Our characters are confronted by cyborgs new and old (old being a relative term).  There are flying hunter killers, the mean and scary T-600 (who was one of my favorites), hydro terminators, motorcycle terminators, giant terminators and our old friend T-800.  There are machines all over the place and that was the point.  Our resistance soldiers have plenty to shoot at and blow up.  The chases and action are all well done and all effects, CG or not, are eye poppingly sharp and exciting.<br /><br />People may complain about plot.  I'm not too worried about that for my summer action flick.  Earlier Terminator movies had simple plots too (terminator tries to kill someone, get away from terminator with help).  Here we see John Conner working with the resistance as a soldier (not leader yet).  He meets a man named Marcus Wright who donated his body to science before being executed who turns out to be (spoiler twist that you probably know) a terminator who may or may not be programmed to lure John into a trap.  John also hears of his young father, Kyle Reese, and is eager to meet the guy and make sure he is safe.  And he wants to blow up some T-800's before they make life even harder.<br /><br />However, what the earlier Terminator movies had that this one doesn't is development. They might have been simple plots but we learned about our characters, their world, their future and their motivations.  Not so much here.  Sure Marcus is conflicted that he is now a cyborg and there is some ham fisted attempt at the question of \\"what is free will / what does it mean to be a man?\\"  Other than that we simply move from one action scene to the next taking us inevitably to where we knew we were going all along.<br /><br />I would love to have seen development of the dark world from the earlier films with giant rolling terminators on fields of skulls, battalions of T-700's (or maybe T-600's) blasting away, kids watching fire in a TV set but maybe all of that is still in the future.  Also, none of the terminator movies ever sold me on the fact that John Connor is mankind's best hope and this one didn't sell me either and I was hoping it would.  I was hoping to find out why he's so special.  Sure he's tough and rascally but so are plenty of others.  He doesn't seem to be a genius tactician and he didn't start the resistance.  It seems to me that if he died the resistance would just go on. The only reason he's special at all is that he is the prophesied leader of the resistance and that's only because a terminator tried to kill him in the past which means that by trying to kill him Skynet made him the future leader.<br /><br />But the movie was fun.  The action was great and there was a cool cameo and fun little line drops.  Some may feel that dropping an, \\"I'll be back,\\" in is corny or condescending but it's all in good fun really.<br /><br />So the movie is fun and exciting and action packed and is definitely worth watching.  It just doesn't develop or add to the world like I'd hoped. After the excitement wore off and I had time to think that's what disappointed me.ere going all along.

B0017QQZOQ|5.0|I disagree with other reviewers.  I love the Tudors flaws and all.  There are some historical inaccuracies (His son was much older when he died, the king was older then portrayed when he was courting Anne, he courted Anne for 7 years and was married to her for 3 however they squeeze that down into the first 2 seasons etc.) as well as some historiclly accurate incidents (the jousting accident, the day he almost drowned in the mud etc.).  If you do not like film makers dressing up history then any movie or show that covers this era is not for you.  Obviously we do not know exactly what happened each day in King Henry's court. The majority of the film or show has to be made up.  The Tudors was done very well in my opinion.  Very entertaining, just don't look for a history lesson here.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|First of all, let's get some warnings out of the way<br /><br />This album is NOT for you...<br />-If you don't like high school/college maturity level lyrics<br />-If you don't like \\"icky\\" love stories<br />-If you don't like music unless it's challenging and different<br /><br />While this album doesn't have so called \\"deep\\" lyrics that talks about natural disasters and current state of government with metaphors, the lyrics here are very reflective and poetic. It's just very straight forward. Taylor wants you to know what she has in her mind, and even though some of the lyrics can be considered icky(I'm a college aged rock listening guy), some are also very heart warming(The Best Day).<br /><br />To sum it up. Taylor Swift is like the average HS girl opening up to you.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|These triggers are actually very nice. They took just a little getting used to and now I MUCH prefer to use the controller with them. Definitely worth the cost. Hopefully, Sony will change the trigger buttons on future devices.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|Objectively, the first season is about 3.5 stars. Other reviewers rounded down to a single star, so I feel obligated to lift the average.  By the end of the second season, the show has elevated it's quality to at least 13 stars.     The chemistry between the actors is not as great as it could be. Sometimes the writing is heavy-handed in such a way as to prevent the relationships from evolving on-screen the way they would naturally. That said, the characters (except Walter) are not necessarily intended to be endearing.     Like a lot of Abrams other work, it is has real flaws but succeeds in spite of them.  Watch the first season to get yourself up to speed for the second season, which is more than worth the price of admission!
B00000F14B|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend because he was toodling around on the piano with \\"Lida Rose\\" and \\"Goodnight, My Someone.\\"  So, I thought he might like to have the movie.  He LOVES!!! it.  In fact, we both enjoyed watching it.  The songs, the actors (especially little Ronnie Howard) ... now that was when movies were movies.
0060558121|4.0|I mentioned this in my review of \\"Good Omens\\" but just to recap, I came by this book after reading Terry Pratchett's fabulous Discworld series.  From there I went to \\"Good Omens\\", an apocalyptic comedy penned by Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.  So now I'm segueing to Gaiman solo in \\"American Gods.\\"  I have to say, for the record, I think Pratchett's books on the whole are a lot more fun.  While there is humor in \\"American Gods\\" it's darker and a little more subtle--ironic might be the best way.  The difference is probably that the Discworld books are written as comedies while \\"American Gods\\" isn't.  I still enjoyed this, but in a different way.<br /><br />\\"American Gods\\" covers territory covered by Gaiman and Pratchett (or Pratchett & Gaiman) in \\"Good Omens\\" and by Pratchett in Discworld books like \\"Small Gods\\" and \\"Hogfather.\\"  That territory is the concept that gods exist because people believe in them; gods are an extension of a human belief to believe in something.  Over time, for a variety of reasons, belief in gods rises and falls.  For instance, thousands of years ago no one outside the Middle East had ever heard of the god we know as GOD.  They believed in their own more local gods, some like the Greek/Roman gods we studied in school and still remember because they're named for things like planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto) or Greek restaurants.  Others have pretty much faded away from memory entirely, except perhaps for an artifact in a museum.<br /><br />What Gaiman does in \\"American Gods\\" is to take that concept a step farther.  For thousands of years people have been coming to America--\\"Native\\" Americans, Spanish, French, English, Dutch, and of course the Vikings--and with them they bring their gods and make sacrifices to them and build places of worship to them and so forth.  And in the process they give life to those gods in America.  But what becomes of the gods after war, disease, slavery, and assimilation have eroded that belief in them?  Basically they're left roaming the countryside, living essentially as mortals.<br /><br />A big man named Shadow gets out of prison and meets one of these fallen gods, a grifter now going by the name of Mr. Wednesday.  With no job, no family, and no place to live, Shadow agrees to become Wednesday's bodyguard for a dangerous mission that takes them across the United States, though much of the action is centered in Illinois and Wisconsin.  There's a storm coming, one that threatens not just Shadow but the entire fabric of reality.  Because, you see, there are new gods being created everyday--gods of Technology and Media and so forth.  When old gods and new gods clash, all hell is bound to break loose.<br /><br />As for Shadow, he has to confront his tragic past and his destiny.  Plus he has to find a way to bring his zombie wife back to life.<br /><br />Overall this is a good book, though the ending seems pretty anticlimactic.  I guess that's how life is sometimes.  It would help too if you knew more about mythology than I do; I know a little about Greek and Norse myths from school but Gaiman includes myth creatures from pretty much every culture in the world.  (Though it seems like the Greek gods like Zeus, Aphrodite, Athena, Poseidon, and so forth are missing.)  Anyway, I think this is the kind of book I'd really have to read a second time--or possibly more--to GET it because there's so much going on.<br /><br />Of course a lot of people will probably steer clear of a book like this because it might challenge their personal beliefs.  Though I personally like a religious philosophy where pretty much everyone can be right.<br /><br />That is all.in them?

Though I personally like a religious philosophy where pretty much everyone can be right.<br /><br />That is all.
B000UR9QGW|5.0|Five years since Ash (Bruce Campbell) battled the demonic forces of evil in the woods of Tenessee, he has forgotten about that horrible night. Now he sets off on a vacation with a girl named Linda to a secluded cabin in the woods, over there he discovers an old book of the dead similar to the one he encountered before. He even discovers an old dagger and a tape reel that translates the bizarre language of the book as he foolishly unleashes the dead by accident. Evil spirits began to torment him including possessing people around him as he fights evil creatures, zombies and even his own hand that gets possessed.<br /><br />An ingenious sequel/semi-remake to the 1981 cult masterpiece of terror from writer-director-producer Sam Raimi. It's one of those rare sequels that could actually surpass the original using a dose of dark humor and over-the-top gore more then the original. While some may say this is a remake of the first one then a sequel, i'd say it works well as a semi-sequel and semi-remake combined. It's a true classic of the 80's with the brilliant make-up effects by KNB with amazing camera trickery and memorable quotes that turned this movie into one of the most unique cult movies of all time.<br /><br />The Lionsgate 25th anniversary blu-ray is fantastic with quality picture with some minor grain at the ending but still a very solid transfer and has excellent extras like audio commentary with hours of featurettes from it's humble beginnings to the cult classic it has became since then, trailer and still galleries. A definite upgrade for those that had it on DVD, buy this now.
B0000CBHOI|5.0|No one is going to be 100% pleased with this movie, but I personally appreciate the efforts of all to put it together and found it to be full of unexpected delights. I agree with one of the reviewers that the footage of Skip James is worth the the price of the entire set alone.<br />I also take issue with some reviewers that decried the inclusion of Lulu singing the blues - it was very soulful, and in fact, brings home the point that the English were paying attention to, and moved by the blues, when most of America was glued to sonic bubble-gum.<br />Those that whine and whimper endlessly about the lack of blues credibility<br />of some of the performers, historical errors, and personal preferences of the directors are probably just the sort who do little themselves to spread joy and wonder - the message of the blues for these people is a one-way street. For those that think this was boring...good luck, and fasten your seat belts, because you're in for a lifetime of boredom.
1592402690|5.0|Excellent book. My only gripe would be he seemed to put down George Harrison quite a lot (and rarely a bad word for Paul McCartney...)
B0001ZXM54|5.0|I normally don't buy \\"best of\\" albums. This is the exception to the rule.ZZ topp is not my favorite band but I am a fan!! I had 3 ZZ topp albums but I totally forgot about some of their earlier stuff!!    This album had just about every hit you ever heard of!!! I was re-united with the earlier stuff like \\"Francene\\" and \\"Thunderbird\\" and one of the greatest songs of all time, \\"Beer Drinkers & Hell Raisers\\"!!! The songs rock and as the band evolves you see they are still true to their original form. Yes some of their 80's material got a little too \\"computer -sounding\\", but they are still that \\"Little Ole Band From Texas\\" that will ROCK THE EYEBALLS RIGHT OUT OF YOUR SOCKETS!!!    One bit of warning the 70's material will get you to crave Mexican food,beer and  whorehouses !!!    BUY THIS ALBUM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I own 3 standard six-axis controllers and purchased one of these to have an even set of 4. This is by far better than the original six-axis controllers that were released with the early versions of the PS3. I almost purchased an additional one this afternoon at the store because my buddies and I all prefer to use the dualshock.<br /><br />The controller feels more solid then the PS2 dualshocks ever did. Great controller! I suggest it over any other knock-off brand.
1416914307|5.0|i really loved this book and the other two books before it, i recommend this book along with city of bones and city of ashes.
B0015UKX7Y|5.0|I'm not a music expert, but from the moment my husband put this CD in the player I was hooked. Incredible, symphonic pop-rock with a retro feeling that's quite unique in an age that nothing seems original anymore. Can't hear it enough and it's even not the style I usually listen to!
B00288KNJU|5.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.<br /><br />Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of \\"Coraline,\\" brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed \\"other mother\\" (Teri Hatcher) and matching \\"other father,\\" (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's book \\"Coraline\\" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.<br /><br />Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach.\\" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.<br /><br />The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.<br /><br />Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.<br /><br />The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a pair of fun cameos as the kooky neighbors.<br /><br />Apparently the blu-ray (as usual now) will have some material not included on the standard DVDs. There's going to be a trio of featurettes about making and voicing the movie, deleted scenes, a digital copy, and a movie commentary -- and exclusive to the blu-ray is ANOTHER featurette, \\"picture in picture,\\" BD-live, and something called \\"My Scenes Sharing.\\"<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\" is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and eerie creatures.Definitely a must-see, for those who enjoy a movie with some genuine chills.
B001NLL8LA|1.0|Would love to buy this book because I love the Reacher novels, but I feel cheated that Amazon sold me on the lower price of best sellers for Kindle, and now they are not living up to this.  PLEASE DON'T BUY AN KINDLE BOOKS FOR MORE THAN $9.99 or they will continue to go up.
0385340990|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The format was difficult at first and I recommend keeping a few notes until you get all the characters clear in your head. However, the characters are eventually all well developed. The authors do a creditable job of writing as post-war English ladies with one or two exceptions: Brits write TO one another rather than just writing each other and there were no teabags to be distributed by liberating Tommies (Ye Gods!). Nevertheless a strong positive recommendation.
B000001ED1|5.0|In some ways, the weakest track of this CD might be One Of Us, (one of the few tracks not at least co-penned by Joan):  That says something about the strength of this CD.  One of Us is nearly a tongue-in-cheek throw-away that's rescued by her excellent non-melodramatic delivery.  Joan's also able to evoke emotions in different genres going from ~Muscle Shoals to rockabilly to nearly atonal (I hear strands of Michelle Shocked and Jonatha Brooke and more in between).  Containing unusually high production standards and crisp instrumentation, each song compels us to listen to the insightful, always thought provoking lyrics.  It's mysticism, raw sexuality, and separation anxiety all rolled into one.
B001FB4W16|1.0|I bought the blu-ray version for my blu-ray player but when the menu comes up and I click on an episode (any episode, any disc) the HBO static comes up and it shuts off the blu-ray player.  The disc then re-starts.  I can't get past the menu!
B001HPP2XW|5.0|I'm not about to preach about the merits of this classic movie....this is for readers who want to know if they need to throw down for yet another version?  YES, the movie looks the best so far and by a noticeable amount. the BONUS features on disc 2 bring along all the best from the last edition with about an hour of new ones....all very interesting (the 20 minutes on Henry Mancini was my favorite). I picked it up for $7.50 at Target and was very very happy.  If you are a fan of the movie....upgrade..if you are not an owner THIS is the one to get..  the 2 DVD Paramount version.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Star Trek ventured far beyond the previous 11 movies.  Not only did it fill the gaps from the original series, its visual effects are exceptional.  The premise is typical Star Trek, that is a bit over the top, but very enjoyable within the framework.  Certain questions went unanswered (such as how and who did Kirk live with while he grew up) but several were answered.  Overall I liked the movie.  It may be the best of all of them with the sole exception of The Voyage Home.  And the cast was outstanding, perfect for their roles.
B001WCN23W|2.0|I don't know why the previous posters are impressed with this re-master.  Sticky Fingers is my personal favorite Stones album, and if you don't have it, get it, but I recommend you seek out the 1994 re-master on Virgin Records.  This re-master distributed by UMD has compressed the top end, probably to hide tape hiss, and boosted the instruments up louder to near distortion levels.  On headphones certain higher pitched sounds like the piano on Moonlight Mile are eardrum piercing, and the organ solo on I Got the Blues is particularly horrid sounding on headphones or open speakers.  On open speakers, the overall poor quality is even more apparent.  While certain sounds, particularly opening guitar riffs, stand out more than before, once the entire band kicks in, the compression leads to a dull thuddy sound, particularly in the drums.  The one song that overall sounds better than before is ironically my least favorite - Sister Morphine.  It now has a menacing quality that has been missing from previous CD masters, but it opens with a clumsy fade-in on the guitar, again probably to mask tape hiss.  Perhaps the most disappointing part of this re-master is that one of my favorite moments in this album - the sudden surprising swell of strings near the end of Sway - is completely buried now.<br />Some have complained about a high end \\"harshness\\" to the Virgin re-masters but to me those are more open and crisp.  If that's your taste, that's what you want.  If you prefer a more bassy limited sound, you might prefer the new re-masters.  As for me I will stick with what I have and not purchase any more UMD re-masters.
0756405890|5.0|Simply one of the best works of fiction that I have had the pleasure of reading, and I have read quite a few. Some have complained about the slow pace of the book. Listen people, this isn't a Star Wars novel or some Voltron cartoon. It's a story that focuses on one character and the struggles that he faces. Take the time to enjoy the character and watch him grow into the hero that the author presents. Rothfuss has some serious skills, and no doubt he will only improve over time. I'm looking forward to the next in the series.
0061733199|5.0|\\"Complete\\" is the word that describes this. If you are wondering if it coveres a certain topic then be sure that it does as it covers everything. Some of the more surprising oddities I've learned:     - What to do if you are in a car that plunges into a river when people need saving in the back seat   - What parts of polar bears are poisonous to eat   - What order you should eat your pets in :)    Seriously though, This is a great book and the answer is certainly \\"yes\\"! whatever you want to know from food preservation, poisons, camping and first aid etc to details of the dangers of different terrains, and tying knots is there.    Handy tips even if you get caught in a nuclear holocaust or want to reduce the chance of being hit by lightning or avoid an avalanch.    It will take a step that many books won't take in describing your options. Like other survival books it may say something like \\"Doing this should not be attempted as you are unlikly to survive\\" but will then usually follow on with \\"but if you absolutely have to, here are some things to increase your chances...\\". No you shouldn't jump out of the window of a burning building before the fire dept have arrived but it's nice to know there are some tips about attempting it if the other option is to just burn to death waiting.

B001GSTOAM|1.0|[Kindle Version Review]<br /><br />The one star is not a reflection of the content of the book, which is clearly a very fine treatise on coding practices, but of the fact that the Kindle version is almost impossible to read. Code samples are truncated, in a variable-width font, and have less-than and greater-than symbols missing. References in the text often refer to listings that are not closely located with that text (eg. \\"see Listing 4-7 on page 71\\" is almost impossible to find on a Kindle without single-paging).<br /><br />This is a book that requires a lot of page flipping, and shouldn't be available on the Kindle unless the publisher is willing to put in some effort to address these readability issues.
0385340575|4.0|I always look forward to a new Reacher novel the way I do a great meal (I'm keeping this PG here)I've planned for weeks. I'm always torn between snarfing it down to find out what happens, or trying to make it last.    I read \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" in less than four hours. Call me a binger. It was worth it.    My only minor quibble is that I really, really wanted to know what was in the picture, and that annoyed me. Other than that, it was Reacher at his best.     Having just read another \\"suspense novel\\" from another, mysteriously best-selling author that was incredibly poorly written and shoddy, reading Lee Childs was the perfect antidote. Thank you.    Of course...now I'm panting for the next installment!
0061122416|1.0|I can't add much to the other negative reviews other than to reiterate what a pitiable waste of trees and time this book is. I choked my way through it because I felt obligated to fully understand the depth of its failure. It is grandiose in its attempt to be profoundly simple, like a pompous man at a coffee shop who talks loudly about his own generosity.    There's nothing wrong with people who find inspiration here, but this book unequivocally shallow and twee. If you really love Thomas Kinkade, The Alchemist is the book for you.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Most reviews here mention VOODOO CHILE as a highlight of the show and a Hendrix tune.  The real significance of this piece is that Winwood played the Hammond B3 on the original studio cut on Hendrix's Electric Ladyland.    Another event worth mentioning is that Buddy Miles who wrote Them Changes and was the drummer for Hendrix's Band of Gypsys died on the night of their second show 2/26.  Miles got to hear them perform CHANGES over a cell phone during the first show 2/25.  The final shows performance on 2/28 of CHANGES was dedicated to Miles.
B0010ZR160|4.0|Gone Baby Gone (Ben Affleck, 2007)<br /><br />My biggest fear with Gone Baby Gone, Ben Affleck's directorial debut, is that he was going to find some way, somehow, to blow the ending. What's truly impressive is that Affleck and co-screenwriter Aaron Stockard flirted with the idea of blowing the ending--you can almost see it coming in the final scene--and then pull back from the brink. I have no idea whether the feint was intentional or not, but either way, it puts the finishing touch on an already impressive movie.<br /><br />Plot: Pat Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angela Gennaro (The Bourne Supremacy's Michelle Monaghan) are private detectives in South Boston. When a four-year-old child goes missing, her aunt (Pollock's Amy Madigan, who's been spending way too much of her time on TV these days) hires Kenzie and Gennaro to \\"augment the police search\\", in Kenzie's words, by talking to people who won't talk to the police. The captain (Morgan Freeman) isn't too thrilled with it, and neither are the two detectives, Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (Instinct's John Ashton), assigned as their police liaison. Everyone finds ways to work together, though the closer they get to the end of the rainbow, the more off the colors look. And it seems like every decision Kenzie makes is contrary to what Gennaro thinks he should do. Trouble cannot be far ahead in paradise.<br /><br />I have to say, though, despite the fact that I really did like this movie, there was one thing about it that really, really annoyed me. It's something most people who read the book probably didn't even notice. During the first meeting with the detectives in the novel, Gennaro asks if Bressant minds if she smokes. Bressant looks at her longingly and says, \\"Please?\\". It was cut out of the movie, of course, because smoking is eeeeeeeeeeevil and can never, ever be portrayed in a positive light. But the movie does suffer from it; the scene, in a very few words and gestures, shows us something critical that's missing from the movie (and if I tell you what it is, I'll spoil one of the big, big revelations, so I won't. Just trust me). Still, it does well enough without that component. The actors are top-notch, the script tight and fast-paced, and as the ending tells us, Affleck doesn't pull his punches, either the one in front of the camera or the one behind it. Very well done. *** ½vie (and if I tell you what it is, I'll spoil one of the big, big revelations, so I won't. Just trust me). Still, it does well enough without that component.

B001PJRAUS|1.0|The actors just did not draw me in and they changed the story line too much. I do not recommend this version. If you are a Pride and Prejudice Firth/Ehle version fan, this will only serve to disappoint.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Just as many reviews indicate, this workout is very difficult.  I haven't gotten past level one.  I am using five pound weights and wonder if I should have started with three pounds.  I have done the workout probably 10 times now (2-3 times per week).  The numbers on the scale haven't changed but I know it has got to be doing something good for me because it works me so hard!  This workout is easy to follow and you don't have to be coordinated to do it.  (Thank goodness)  I would recommend this workout video but don't get discouraged when you find out how difficult it is.  Just do the best you can with it!
0765350386|5.0|MISTBORN is an original take on an often over done genre. Brandon Sanderson did a wonderful job in creating this new world with new magic and enough common elements that the reader is not lost, yet enough intrigue to keep your attention peaked. I will definitly be buying the next book of the series for this one! Way to go!
B001GM28HO|5.0|Unlike most CDs where only a few songs were good, this CD is jam-packed with songs perfect for a cardio workout, road trip or the clubs.
B0012GMVQC|5.0|This is such a great departure for Jeff Beck, and though those who like his older stuff may not enjoy this album, those who love instrumental guitar rock, this is THE Jeff Beck album to buy. great songs from begining to end. I love to listen to this whole album on repeat.
B001ED7C5I|4.0|Tracy Chapman has yet to deliver a bad album although some have been disappointing.  Happily that's not the case with Our Bright Future.  It starts with the infectious 'Sing For You' and from there only gets better with the exception of, in this reviewers opinion, 'Saves us All' (never have been comfortable with preachy songs and in this one Chapman declares her faith in Jesus and states 'don't know about you').    That aside it does take a few listens to really appreciate this album as it treads much of the same ground as all her albums.  Chapman's warm vocals and the counting in on a few tracks make for a very intimate listening experience indeed.    'A Theory' and 'Conditional' appear in the latter half of the CD and are probably the best two tracks but not by much as 'First Person on Earth' comes mighty close.  The feeling throughout is of an artist who knows where she came from and knows where she's going, comfortable in her own skin and enjoying making her music her way.    All-in-all a great addition to the Chapman catalogue and one which will be revisited in the more reflective moments.
B001FB55MG|4.0|This is what i call a good feel movie it shows with a great imagination you can transform into anyone .If you have never had children it's a great way to discover how you feel about bonding through stories whether they are real or imaginitive the movie follows all emotions it's funny'; shows lots of adventure and  of course he finds love where he lest expects it this is a wonderful adventure for the whole family where happy endings can come true this is a heartwarming  comedy adventure
081186510X|4.0|Well, the books is great. Lots of photos and it is fun to have it autographed. My bummer is they lowered the price by $10.00 right after I bought this book. Bad for me, good for you. Also, if you call Book Soup or look at their website, this book is sold out. Yet, they are selling it here in Amazon. Not sure what that is all about. Book was shipped out no problems.
B000002KKD|5.0|The thing about the B-52s, this album especially, is that though their reference points are obvious and ridiculous--old '50s sci-fi movies, bad high school dances-in-the-gym bands and, generally, a '50s TV sit-com view on the universe--the music they make out of all this junk is somehow absolutely original, brilliant and memorable. Right up there with the most inspired music of its day, from \\"Horses\\" to \\"The Clash.\\" And, of course, total blissed-out dance madness to boot--which you can't really say about \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\"...
0061122416|3.0|Santiago is perfectly happy living his life as a shepherd, traveling from town to town, looking forward to the people he'll meet, having plenty of time to read.  Then he has a dream, about a treasure buried near the Egyptian pyramids.  He is prepared to ignore the dream and continue on with his life, until he is gently urged by several strangers to follow his heart and take the adventure.    Santiago sets off on his journey, encountering many roadblocks along the way.  He thinks about giving up, about going back home to his flock of sheep.  But Santiago heard the message to follow his heart, and continues to go back to that advice time after time.    I liked the characters in this story, especially Santiago with his gentle introspection.  The ending of the story was satisfying and made sense.  This book was an easy and pleasant read, although not groundbreaking material.
0156030209|5.0|the key quote of the book (the last few words)<br />I can well imagine an atheist's last words: \\"White, white! L-L-Love! My God!\\"--and the deathbed leap of faith. Whereas the agnostic, if he stays true to his reasonable self, if he stays beholden to dry, yeastless factuality, might try to explain the warm light bathing him by saying, \\"Possibly a f-f-failing oxygenation of the b-b-brain,\\" and, to the very end, lack imagination and miss the better story.<br /><br />Is this a book on religion?  maybe.  Is it pro or con of it?  Could be argued both ways.  Is it a wonderful story of hope and optimism?  yep.<br /><br />This is my favorite book, so I need not say more.  I am happier for having read it, which is asking a lot of a book.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|Unfortunately, even the superb acting talents of Daniel Craig can't save Quantum of Solace from a pedestrian script and a flash editing style that makes the action scenes incomprehensibly difficult to follow most of the time. While flash editing has been used effectively before many times, it usually isn't combined with fast moving and deliberately over-shaky hand held camera work, and for good reason. Rather than impress, the action scenes in Quantum of Solace simply disorient the viewer. I found myself fast forwarding through the action scenes, the first time I've ever done that in a James Bond film. Rent it once to watch Craig's performance. Buy it only if it's important for you to have a complete set of Bond films.
0316017922|4.0|The social econ genre that might have started with another Gladwell book is now a cottage industry.  These are all very interesting books that make you see things in different ways.  This really makes you think twice about the idea of hard work and talent can overcome all, although I suspect many have always realized that many external influences play a HUGE role in why people succeed.
B002716GU8|2.0|The trailer is very compelling but alas, also the only success in this Clint Eastwood production! The true incident from 1928 is dramatic and inspiring and should have made an excellent script.     The characters are appallingly weak almost as though the period costumes and set were a distraction! Angelina is hugely disappointing as one may expect but John Malkovich? Clearly the director has failed. The screenplay is a whole disappointment unto itself and not just because its predictable in a school play sort of way. If the Academy had to award bad performances, this movie would sweep a dozen. This movie also features the worst portrayal of a police captain in the history of film (again, clearly the director's failure.) The narration of the gruesome slaughter of mere children is so terrible, its actually not disturbing!    Worst of all, it runs about 2.5 hours. What a waste!
0312539517|5.0|I had heard the story of George Mallory's climb of Everest and have always been intrigued with stories of all the expeditions.  Path of Glory is a fictional work that tells the story of George Mallory's life and possible scenario of his Mt Everest expedition and death.      This is a well written book.  It covers several pivotal events in Mallory's life - his military years, his meeting and romancing his wife, and of the Everest climb.  At times I felt like it was more biography then fiction.  Archer has a definite knack for blending fact and fiction seamlessly.      This was the first Jeffrey Archer book I've read and I won't be the last.
B001FB55HG|4.0|The Terminator movies are basically chase movies, the terminator(s) chasing John or Sarah Connor while they try to chase down Skynet. but the open ended format of the Terminator series has given the franchise a resilience, and within the mythology created is able to use themes of what makes one either human or a machine. Terminator Salvation develops this more than the other movies in the series, focusing more on the human aspects instead of just a hunt.<br /><br />Christian Bale plays the adult John Connor, but he's not exactly where we thought he'd be when we last saw him. He isn't the head of the resistance, he's close but he's taking orders from others and it seems to chafe at him that he isn't being listened to. On one mission he infiltrates a Cyberdyne laboratory where he discovers the plans to a new terminator series, the T-800 (the Arnold Schwarzenegger model) and he inadvertently releases a new type of cyborg.<br /><br />Sam Worthington play Marcus Wright, a death row prisoner executed before judgment day, but he donated his body to science in the hopes he might do some good in the world. When he wakes up in 2018 he doesn't realize he's changed, he's no longer human, or is he? Is he following his free will or responding to programming?<br /><br />Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor isn't given a lot to do except stand around looking matronly (she's pregnant), and be pretty, for some reason she's wearing a lot of make-up that seems a little out of place during an all encompassing war. She isn't even given as much to do as Claire Danes did in Rise of the Machines. Christian Bale plays John Connor as a pretty hard man but even hard men have tender moments with loved ones and Howard's character should  have been the softening agent for Bale to play against.

B001IKKMCW|3.0|I also own the DVD version and I most say that I prefer that version to the blu-ray version, in the other hand the blu-ray is HD of curse so no complain there.<br />That's way I give a neutral score to this blu-ray.
B002436WJE|4.0|If this was 1987 or 88, this would have been a star-vehicle for the likes of Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger. But they have moved past their heyday, and in Arnold's case, even past acting. But would anyone ever have pictured a mild mannered characther actor to deliver as stunning a performance as Liam Neeson does in Luc Besson's \\"Taken?\\" Step back and be prepared...\\"Taken\\" gets almost everything an actioner could get perfect.<br /><br />Neeson steps up to the plate as a retired special operations soldier/spy who feels like he needs to be a better dad. What could be a better way to prove your worth than to rescue your daughter when she gets kidnapped by a sex-slave ring? While Neeson tends to deliver deep character studies like [[ASIN:B0007PALGG Kinsey,]] this time he goes all \\"[[ASIN:B001L5SRJE 24]]\\" on us and starts busting up the baddies. At the same time, he shows his anguish under all the bravado, elevating \\"Taken\\" from the generic.<br /><br />Writer/Producer Besson is no stranger to this turf; he all but perfected it when he introduced America to Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in [[ASIN:B0006GVJEE Leon - The Professional (Deluxe Edition)]]. What he does with \\"Taken\\" is make you remember that even Jack Bauer types are family men, even as they manage to dodge the bullets of Middle Eastern gangs with an arsenal of M-16's. If it weren't for Neeson's take on Spy-Dad Bryan Mills, \\"Taken\\" could have easily devolved into a random revenge flick. Economical, tight and loaded with whupazz, \\"Taken\\" shows that an action film can dish up both brains and brawn.
B002962RKE|5.0|Fabulous.  Loved the definite edge.  Waiting expectantly for more and hope the sharpness continues.
B0027P77CU|5.0|Awesome beginning to the four album cycle.  Cannot wait to hear the rest of the series!  A must buy for any Devin Townsend fan.
B00004RFFW|4.0|Riggs and Murtaugh. Those eighties cop movies and cop buddy movies were great and few duos were better than Gibson and Glover as the odd couple pair of cops who start out hating each other, but grow into the best of friends as the series progressed.    This second Lethal Weapon was just about as good as the first with several memorable scenes and moments. They sometimes blur together now, but I believe this one had the classic surfboard scene, the incredibly hot short haired blonde, and the racist South Africans. Diplomatic immunity?    Well worth seeing and a great action film.
B0002XMF62|5.0|Some major drama concerning personnel did not deter the band from cranking out one of its best studio albums ever.<br /><br />Tony Martin replaced Ray Gillen on lead vocals, with the lineup - no matter what the credits - being Tony Iommi (g), Bob Daisley (b), Eric Singer (d) and Geoff Nichols (k). The Shining is one of the best songs ever recorded by the band and the interplay between Martin and Iommi throughout the album is incredible. Hard Life to Love, Born to Lose and Glory Ride battle The Shining for top laurels. Nichols takes center stage on the title track and Ancient Warrior.<br /><br />The album peaked at #168 on the Billboard 200 chart. The band disregarded a powerful storm of turmoil and delivered a thirteenth studio album that is in the mix to being number one in the impressive, vast discography.
0060578793|4.0|The focus of this book is about short term survival. It does focus on living off the land, the mental aspects, tools and survival tactics, but mostly in the light of surviving an accident or disaster when help is on the way. Conditioning yourself to live long enough for help to arrive.    It made me realize how bad things would be if help wasn't on the way and how ill prepared we are in the event of massive disaster or something changing the entire planet.    You can't take people used to running water, sanitation, cell phones, the Internet, grocery stores, cars, and whatever else and toss them out there and expect them to live beyond being a scavenger.    It's a good read, but there are updated versions of this book now available.
B0002XMF5S|3.0|The recording sessions for this album were slated for a Tony Iommi solo album....that is until the record label - and band manager - wanted a Black Sabbath release. The band's name and the album cover photo apparently is an agreement of sorts between Iommi and the suits in the marketing of his project.<br /><br />Glenn Hughes (v), Dave Spitz (b), Eric Singer (d) and Geoff Nichols (k) power through the nine tracks that are drenched in the blues, with Iommi leading the way on guitar. The title track, Sphinx (The Guardian), Danger Zone and Heart Like a Wheel show versatile artistry that is not looking to the past to kick-start a band that had stumbled miserably during a 1984 tour and had essentially broken up.<br /><br />Black Sabbath began to regain momentum in the years to come and this album was the foundation piece to get the show back on the road.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I am very pleased with this live recording. The sound quality is excellent, and Clapton & Winwood sound great together. I've seen the Clapton: Crossroads 2008 DVD from August, 08 in Chicago...the 1st reunion, and the stuff they did together blew me away. I was hoping this disc was more of what I saw, and it is.    The setlist is awesome with a great \\"Low Down\\", a very bluesy \\"Double Trouble\\" and the slowed down \\"Voodoo Chile Jam\\". I could have done without \\"Forever Man\\", but still an awesome show.    You won't be disappointed!

B000002ACR|5.0|After the departure of Gene Clark in 1966, no one knew if the Byrds could produce another commercially successful album.<br />Jim McGuinn, David Crosby, Chris Hillman & Michael Clarke showed they still could with this wonderfully eclectic album, \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\".<br /><br />The Tracks:<br /><br />The Monkees were all the rage in late '66 / early '67, and McGuinn and Hillman thought it would be nice to write a \\"formula\\" for aspiring rockers.<br />\\"So You Want To Be A Rock And Roll Star\\" was the song they wrote, full of all the elements needed for success, including combing your hair and tight pants.<br />Learning how to play was also important, something the Byrds did well. The song opens with McGuinn's signature electric 12-string, which is built upon by Hillman's driving bass, and some soaring trumpet by legendary trumpeter Hugh Masakela. The requisite screaming girls are also present, completing this classic '60's anthem.<br /><br />\\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" is a Chris Hillman composition, inspired by the Beatles' \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", which in turn, was inspired by the Byrds.<br />The glorious 3-part harmonies, Michael Clarke's above average drumming and McGuinn's staggering electric guitar breaks, this track , for me, is the album's finest.<br /><br />\\"C.T.A.-102\\" is McGuinn tribute to life out among the stars, complete with bizzare sound effects, and sped-up backward voices to simulate alien life forms. Radical sounds for early 1967.<br /><br />\\"Rennaissance Fair\\" is primarily a Crosby vehicle that he wrote after attending just such an event. Hillman's bass is the main musical highlight on this short, but sweet track.<br /><br />\\"Time Between\\" is a Hillman tune that is stone-cold country. Vern Gosdin adds acoustic guitar, and future Byrds member Clarence White makes his first appearance on a Byrds record with his trusty Telecaster.<br />\\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" is David Crosby's torch song with a slightly psychedelic feel, with Crosby's smooth-as-silk vocal and McGuinn's haunting 12-string.<br /><br />When originally released in 1967, Chris Hillman's \\"Thoughts And Words\\" opened side 2, and it was a powerful piece of music, featuring Hillman's \\"weary\\" vocal style, a counter-melody,Crosby's slashing rhythm guitar, McGuinn' fingerstyle work and dual backwards guitar solos.<br /><br />\\"Mind Gardens\\" is Crosby at his psychedelic best, and the analogy was simpler than one might think upon hearing; the mind is a garden, needing nurturing and love, while being protected against harsh elements. McGuinn's backwards guitars lend an ethereal feel.<br /><br />The next song is classic folk rock in the traditional Byrds style, Bob Dylan's \\"My Back Pages\\".<br />As always, McGuinn handles the vocals on a Dylan cover, which is an anti-protest protest tune that says \\"I was so much older then; I'm younger than that now\\" , which inspired the album's title. The vocal is spot on, the chorus harmonies smooth, and McGuinn's 12-string chiming clearer than ever. This was to be the Byrds' last top 40 hit.<br />A shorter mix with guitar through a Leslie speaker appears as a bonus track.<br /><br />\\"The Girl With No Name\\" is another Chris Hillman country influenced tune in the same vein as \\"Time Between\\".<br /><br />The album's closer is a re-make of 1966's \\"Why\\". Though many may disagree with me on this one, but I feel this re-make is superior to the original. The arrangement is tighter, the faster tempo rocks, and the vocals and instrumentation clearer. One of the band's best performances ever.<br /><br />The bonus tracks ( other than \\"My Back Pages\\" ) are \\"Don't Make Waves\\" a movie theme song, an early version of \\"Mind Gardens\\", a well produced single called \\"Lady Friend\\" and it's flipside \\"Old John Robertson\\", another country style tune.<br />All these tracks strengthen an already strong collection.<br /><br />The Byrds' best album - 5 Stars.ed in 1967, Chris Hillman's \\"Thoughts And Words\\" opened side 2, and it was a powerful piece of music, featuring Hillman's \\"weary\\" vocal style, a counter-melody,Crosby's slashing rhythm guitar, McGuinn' fingerstyle work and dual backwards guitar solos.    \\"Mind Gardens\\" is Crosby at his psychedelic best, and the analogy was simpler than one might think upon hearing; the mind is a garden, needing nurturing and love, while being protected against harsh elements.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Before entering Star Trek, you should know that you might find more of a character-driven drama rather than your typical summer action flick. Sure, there's special effects and action, but it's one of the more uninteresting elements of the movie, but then again, the movie doesn't really need it as J.J. Abrams aims to start anew with the franchise and remind the millions why they fell in love with it in the first place.<br /><br />At first, the movie starts off as a prequel in the traditional sense that it follows how the main characters came to be, and why they come to do what they eventually do. Here, Abrams takes his time to design these familiar characters from the fatherless and rebellious James T. Kirk, to the outcast Spock who is constantly trying to find a place for himself in the universe. Raised by circumstance, driven by a search of destiny, the pair soon find their paths, personalities cross, and clash at Starfleet Academy. Of course, fate eventually lead the duo at odds to find themselves on the christening voyage of the U.S.S. Enterprise, which happens to make a run-in with the exact same villain who had killed Kirk's father some minutes before his birth. Strangely enough, the villain is looking for revenge... What Star Trek villain hasn't wanted that before? Make no mistake about it; Eric Bana would be a wasted one-dimensional character if you could tell it was Eric Bana beneath all that makeup.<br /><br />Of course, the plot doesn't do your mind any favors either because by the end of the movie it's not really a prequel since by the use of time-travel the adventures you've known from the faithful crew never really happened. No Kahn, no whales in San Francisco, no drawn-out scenes of inter-galactic diplomacy. Yet, by the genius of J.J. Abrams none of this really matters while you're watching the movie, mainly because of the likable and relatable characters.<br /><br />The casting is also inspired as Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto come into their own as actors as they give these familiar characters the twists and turns as they make them their own. Even the supporting cast brings new life to relatively limited personalities. Karl Urban who pays tribute to DeForest Kelly in every line he utters as the wisecracking and supportive Dr. McCoy. Zoe Saldana whose character of Uhura is actually given a purpose within in the series, and accentuates the polarizing personalities of Kirk and Spock. May I also mention that the supposed love-triangle in the movie is greatly exaggerated from scenes of flirting.<br /><br />Another key that Star Trek so surprisingly good is the fact that it's directed by a minor Star Trek fan who brings a filmmaker's prospective to the series, and two self-proclaimed Trekkie screenwriters, who also happened to pen the Transformers series. Star Trek is a mix of fandom and good filmmaking that is sure to please both fans and non-fans alike. If anything, the stage is set for a killer sequel.<br /><br />On A Random Note: According to this movie, in the future Iowa not only has canyons, but becomes quite the industrial powerhouse building various starships. Who knew corn country who become such a bustling place in the future?<br /><br />Real Score: 4.5familiar characters the twists and turns as they make them their own.

B00005MP58|4.0|I ordered \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", 1995 BBC miniseries version, because my granddaughter needed to do a school report on it. We had already seen the Hallmark 2005 version and I was probably not able to be unbiased on watching the older version. I thought the casting for the Hallmark version was perfect in most cases. The British version seemes a little stiff and stilted to me. Donald Sutherland was most excellent.
B001SO69IY|5.0|I had no idea this album was coming, but damn it's tight! I like the first one better, but that won't keep me from enjoying the  Blackout!2.  I'm glad I'm not in high school because kids today don't know what hip hop is even when they hear it. The team of Red and Meth just showed you how hip hop is done w/ this one. Keep playing garbage like girl unit, soulja girl, lil jon, or lil wayne's carter III if you have no taste for true hip hop, the rest of us know quality when we hear it.
0385338732|3.0|I enjoy a fun piece of chick lit from time to time and liked many of the previous Kinsella-novels (and disliked a few of them as well), so when I was going to be air-travelling for some hours and needed something light for the plane-ride, this one was an easy choice. And it is an easy read, built on the trusted chick lit formula we know so well: confused gal in her mid-twenties/early thirties goes through some kind of (fun) obstacles and ends up with Mr. Right in the end. Nothing at all wrong with that formula, and I am not here to diss those who love chick lit. Like I said, I enjoy it myself from time to time.<br /><br />This one is also relatively enjoyable, although I found it, well, farfetched in places. You can argue that most chick lit is rather far-fetched and that is why we read it, but alas, I enjoyed most of the book and found both heroine and Mr. Right to be charming characters (whereas I grew seriously tired of Becky Bloomwood of the Shopaholic-series and found her less and less likeable), which is always a plus.<br /><br />Lexi, our heroine, wakes up with amnesia and minor bruises after a car-crash. She doesn't remember anything from the past three years, where her life for some reason has taken a turn from the standard-dreary-bleary London-life to life in the fast lane with designer clothes, yummy hubby, gorgeous apartment, killer good-looks and a killer-job. But the problem is - Lexi doesn't remember how she got this way, and when she finds out, that her old friends despise her she is even more curious to find out what the heck happened to her, and why she left her old life behind her.<br /><br />Its fun, its light, and surprisingly enough I was actually eager to get to the bottom of Lexi's life and find out how she became this succesful yuppie, marrying a London-millionaire!<br /><br />Had it not been a light chick lit-read, I am pretty sure another type of author would have been able to make a bit more out of those typical subjects: mother/daughter relationship, marriage/single life, rich/poor and so on. But this is not supposed to be too psychological and all that jazz, its just for fun.<br /><br />The ending fizzed out and wasn't that good, but overall I can recommend this for a light read on the beach or something like that. Not into chick lit? Then don't read it, you will not find it amusing at all.fe, rich/poor and so on. But this is not supposed to be too psychological and all that jazz, its just for fun.

Most of us really liked this book.<br /> I enjoyed reading the list of things for a \\"Perfect Man\\".<br />The best scenes were, when she called the police about a naked man and the shopping scene. Too funny to miss.<br />The kitchen scene was cute too.<br />If you want a good book, by a good author,try this one.<br /> It will make you laugh. Also, the list for a perfect man is an interesting topic to discuss with your gal pals.<br /> Everyone has their \\"own\\" Mr. Perfect in their minds. What's yours?
0805079831|5.0|It arrived without the paper cover, but I got it for super cheap, so I don't mind.    The Book peels back the layers of history that brought us to where we are today, and forbodes a dark future unless we realize what's really going on behind the scenes, independent of which party occupies the halls of power.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|I wouldnt believe the naysayers of this show one bit. The easy thing first, if you love Lost or X-Files or smart shows, then this is indeed for sure, Otherwise, keep in mind that there are elements that tie into each other.<br /><br />For those who also say that the show starts off slow, I will semi agree with you BUT, everything makes sense and it starts off slow for a season. All I can say without any spoilers is that every episode and event happens for reason and the show does an amazing job of coming back in and tying in all previous episodes and telling you why they matter.<br /><br />This show is smart, funny and has an epic story to tell, yet can also be enjoyed per episode if thats your thing. Having said that, this show takes the 1st season to tell you about the world and really sets things up for more amazement to come.

159102594X|2.0|This was not one of my favorite books. I didn't mind so much that the author dropped the f-word every 20 seconds (even when it wasn't needed). I did mind that it comes off as overdone, over the top, over baked. I like gritty sff as much as anybody but Abercrombie took the violence too far, and it was reminescent of some of the darker stuff in Goodkind's SoT. For my taste, it was just pointless at times.    On the other hand, I did finish reading it. I thought it started out okay but then after 90 pages of so it just started to drag. I mean really really drag. I had to force myself to keep reading. It went on like this for the next 350 or so page and only started to move again toward the end only to leave you hanging. Unless you have absolutely nothing else remotely interesting to read I would not recommend this book.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This is definitely the best Ring DVD set by far.  Why?  Because in this production, the Gibichungs are Gibichungs.  Which is to say that in this production, the Gibichungs are a wild tribe of the Rhine Valley.  They don't wear suits or tuxedos, as in other DVD versions. Another definite plus is that this Wotan is actually a Norse god, and not a fat slob in sweatpants with plumber's crack. Finaly, it is wonderful to have a Ring NOT directed by some mewling-puking commie scum.    But am I the only one who noticed that in the opening scene of \\"Rhinegold,\\" at the bottom of the Rhine River, the Rhinegold sits at the top of a projecting rock in the middle of the scene.  And, together, this rock and Rhinegold sure look like a gigantic weiner.  (You know what I mean.)  This had to be intentional.    Also, Fricka is great when she gets out the rolling pin in \\"Valkyrie,\\" forcing Wotan to allow the incestous Siegmund to be slain by Hunding.    In sum, this is a great DVD.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|Season three more or less completes a cycle, as island life is changed forever with the set of events that unfold.  Overall, it was a pretty good season.  Certainly plenty of action leading to a fitting season finale in which the viewer discovers the last of the old Dharma stations as Des and Charlie try to open up a line of communication to the outside world.  But, it is the bumpy and confused set of episodes one has come to expect from this series.<br /><br />The viewer learns quite a bit about the Others to whet his appetite.  New characters emerge while others meet their fate on the island.  Locke becomes obsessed in the meaning of the island which takes many twists and turns, leaving Jack in a quandry as to what Locke is really after.<br /><br />The writers struggle to hold all these competing storylines together.  It would seem there are just too many characters with a lot of moving back and forth between the various camps that have emerged.  Much of the mystery is gone, leaving one to wonder what if any metaphysical aspect to this series remains.  But, the writers still want you to believe something deeper lurks at the heart of the island so they pull out Ol' Smokie a few more times and provide some other interesting clues to the island.<br /><br />If you've been sucked into this series, you can't stop now, but in many ways Season Three represented the peak of the series.

B0006N2EZ0|4.0|I loved the music soundtrack when it first came out. I don't know why I waited so long to buy. It answered my curiosity about stardom. I had no idea what can happen, and what a fast paced and crazy life you live if you are in the spotlight. Whitney is wonderful and I fell in love with her all over again. Kevin was wonderful and he takes his bodyguard job seriously and tries not to get too personal and stay professional. The casting was right on, and the music perfectly fits the story. Buy this movie and enjoy.    Debra Envall
0307408833|5.0|I was so excited when I got a copy of this book. I read almost every page when my short-sleep-three-year-old was finally in bed. So far I have only made their famous vanilla cupcake and it turned out wonderful! I have never been to the bakery, so I have no idea how the frosting is different from the actual one, but it was still so tasty.     More than anything else, it is very exciting to be able to make a pretty vegan cake - the book was published right in time for my lacto daughter's birthday! Thank you and I love you Babycakes!

B001GKJ2E8|3.0|It's ironic that a commercial for a video game precedes \\"Wanted\\".  For a good hour or so the film seemed like a lot of white noise and blinding visuals.  It's at about the halfway mark the story starts to kick in and there's some interesting plot twists.  Alas, it's too little too late.  Even at this juncture the director's in-your-face style overwhelms the picture.  If they were going for \\"The Matrix\\" somebody should have told the makers of this film that style of \\"The Matrix\\" went hand-in-hand with the story the Wachowski's were trying to tell.  Interesting but no dice.
B000001EKX|3.0|\\"Hotter Than Hell\\" was released only 6 months after Kiss' self-titled debut, and in some ways it shows:  the playing isn't as tight here, and the songs lack a little polish for less preparation time.  On the other hand, much of the material IS quite strong, and the production quality was beefed up in an attempt to make Kiss actually SOUND \\"like Kiss.\\"    Straight-ahead rockers like the title track, \\"Mainline\\" and \\"Got to Choose\\" have all the bombast you might expect, but they are balanced by occasional oddities like \\"Goin' Blind\\" and \\"Strange Ways.\\"  Peter gets a couple of vocal tracks here, and Kiss is stronger for it:  his bluesy voice, along with Gene's growl and Paul's wail, makes for an extremely efficient triple-threat.    First-time listeners to this disc might actually think something is wrong with their copy due to the heavy fuzz and booming echo.  All involved parties thought that the first Kiss record didn't sound as \\"heavy\\" as they actually did live, so efforts were made to strengthen their sound for their second release, and I must say, \\"Hotter than Hell\\" sounds like no other Kiss record!  It's dark, boomy, a sort of \\"if Phil Spector did heavy metal\\" wall of sound.  My experience with this album is, you either get hooked on it right away, or becomes a rarely-listened-to oddity.
B001TH16DI|3.0|Having just gone through my set of the Blu-Rays, I'm very happily surprised at the content. The only aspect keeping this from being a 4 or 5 star review is the fact that only the theatrical versions are available.  Blu-Ray is specifically made to hold a great deal more data than any prior video or DVD format. Aside from the issues regarding the new effects of the director's cut of TMP, there's little reason (other than monetary) for Paramount to hold back the extended cuts. Seamless branching, used so successfully on the TOS first season set, would work equally well here.<br /><br />The Motion Picture is another story, since the new effects were rendered for lower resolution and it will take time and, of course, money to rerender them. We can expect to see a Director's Edition release on BD in the near future, I'm sure. However, this does not excuse the lack of the inclusion of the extended TV cut put out on video.<br /><br />Having said that, it is an amazing thrill having the theatrical cuts of The Motion Picture, and The Undiscovered Country on disc for the first time ever. TUC was NEVER seen in this version since its original release and until today, I had totally forgotten how good a film it was. Many fans enjoy the additional scenes, but I always felt they brought the film down some. The scenes were obvious and amped up the silliness fact in a film that very much needed to be played straight. The two video versions really brought the maturity level of the story down some notches.<br /><br />Now, however, we once again see the film as originally released 18 years ago (oh God, it's been that long). Over the years, the film had become less enjoyable and fallen down the ranks in my personal list of favorites. None of the other had, but this one - a film I really loved in the theater - had dropped in favor. Now, having watched it again from beginning to end, I found I loved the film once more. The story is tighter and less obvious. These changes were not major, but they made an impact. This is the best movie for the cast to exit on and is once more a 4 star film to me.<br /><br />The Motion Picture: it's great to see this movie in this format again, as released without alteration. However, this film is more problematic. The extended version was just a \\"longer cut\\" with some great scenes added, but none of the fat trimmed (these scenes are included in the extras). The Directors Cut was better paced and more tightly edited and also added some amazing effects to cover some of the less successful work in the picture, but they also lost bits that made the film unique which weren't \\"bad.\\" Since there never actually was a \\"perfect\\" version of this film, it's vital all three versions should be made available (or maybe someone should redo the DE).<br /><br />The Wrath of Kahn: again the theatrical cut and, as we all know, this film had the full restoration, presumably because the master elements needed it badly while the other films were fine. I'll comment on picture shortly, but let's just say this is a fantastic presentation of the movie.<br /><br />Finally The Search for Spock, my favorite Trek film. For those who notice such things, the video versions always screwed up the opening credits. The VHS version had them replaced by \\"video graphics\\" which looked like a cheap, high school AV squad attempt to make Star Trek movie credits. The wide screen VHS and laserdiscs were much better, givings us the titles seen in the film. However, the DVDs had a \\"glitched\\" version of the titles, with the timing off badly. It's tough to explain, but if you compare the BD and the DVD opening credits, you'll see them. And since this is my all time favorite Trek film, one I saw in the theater 7 times and memorized with obsessive Trekkie abandon, you can imagine my thrill when I saw the BD version corrected the credits. Ahhhh! :-)<br /><br />Okay, my impression of the picture quality. There's been a lot said about the excessive digital noise reduction Paramount slathered on the films. I was expecting some bad stuff when I fired up my 52 inch HDTV. You know what I got? An amazing picture - every time. The level of sharpness and clarity to these films is a revelation! I had NEVER seen these films looking so amazingly sharp and detailed. The Wrath of Kahn, which - as noted - got the real restoration, is very nice, but I didn't notice a huge difference between this restoration and the other films. Mostly, I noticed the print was a little darker than prior prints and the other films. The blacks do hold up well on BD, better than on HD-DVD, to my surprise.<br /><br />I have read that those who watch the movies on HUGE screens will notice the DNR, I have to say that my 52 inch, which I sit 6 to 8 feet away from, does not reveal any obvious dullness. And, really, I would assume the great majority of people don't go much larger than 52 inch (unless you have a mansion and more money than God). Honestly, I have no issues with the picture quality, and can wholeheartedly give the picture a thumbs up.<br /><br />The sound is also extremely impressive. The dialog is not lost among the music and sound effects, like so many other HD presentations. The muddiness in much of Kahn and The Search for Spock is not as strong, and the music score for the films never sounded so good.<br /><br />The subtitles for various alien languages are, however, disc generated, not embedded in the films. So the \\"species centric\\" fonts are lost (and, I guess, really doesn't make these true theatrical cuts). However, they are not obviously bad or \\"video titles\\" and won't stand out to people not that familiar or who don't care.<br /><br />To sum up: the only disappointment is in the fact that there's plenty of room for all versions of the films, either side by side or through branching, so (aside from the DE of TMP), there's no reason to have left them out. Having all versions would justify the price tag of this double or triple dip. Especially since you know Paramount will release these again with these versions included.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a great set. The theatrical cuts are the versions I fell in love with and it's great to have them back. The picture is outstanding, with refreshing sharpness and clarity, while the sound mix is comfortable and satisfying.<br /><br />5 stars for the presentation<br />Subtract 2 stars for leaving out the alternate versions.<br /><br />For fans of the original cuts, this is an essential set. It's up to you to decide if you want to hold out for the next and probably more complete release of these films.bad stuff when I fired up my 52 inch HDTV. You know what I got?

B000E41MS6|5.0|I loved Doctor Who when I was a kid.  I followed the show through its various incarnations and happy when it was brought back.  I was worried it would be too pop and trendy but was pleased with the results.    I just cannot figure out why a £14.97 title runs for $65 here in the states.    I mean a reasonable markup is one thing but really this is plain greed.    Oh well there's still BBC for me.  :p

B001GCUO1G|4.0|I went to view this film with a youger relative who really didn't care for what we saw.  I, on the other hand, enjoyed the special effects and found the plot to be creative in a sense.  These types of films are generally not my cup of tea, but this one is recommended.
B0015KO52S|5.0|Actually, my spouse is the one who bought and loves this album.  We are both fans of the White Stripes, so we thought we'd like this CD with Jack White.

0545123267|5.0|The book tells the story from the alternating points of view of two characters. Grace has been watching the wolves outside her Mercy Falls, Minnesota home every winter. She is drawn to one in particular that has stunning yellow eyes, and she's certain that it is the same wolf who saved her from a pack of wolves who attacked her when she was a young girl.    Sam leads two lives. In the spring and summer, he's human, but when the cooler temperatures of autumn descend upon him, it's not long before he turns into a wolf for the winter. The problem with being a werewolf is that the longer you're a wolf, the less time you spend in your human form until one spring, you don't change back and are forever a part of the wolf world.    When Grace meets Sam, one look at his yellow eyes makes her certain that he's her wolf. They are drawn to each other and it doesn't take them long to realize that they've been in love for years as impossible as it may seem. As the temperatures get cooler, Sam and Grace struggle to keep him human, but the bitter cold and other obstacles threaten to take him away from her forever.    What I love about Maggie Stiefvater's writing, especially in Shiver, is that it's completely seamless: the transitions between the two main characters' points of view and the way that she brings werewolves into what seems like a perfectly normal world. I'm one of those people who rarely reads chapter titles or headings because I find them distracting, and not once did I have to glance up at the beginning of a chapter to see who was speaking. Sam and Grace have their own distinct voices and characteristics, but the switch from character to character is not jarring the way I've seen it in a lot of other books. And the coolest thing? Grace and Sam each have their own strengths and complement each other well. I love to see strong female characters in books for teens, and Grace is definitely smart and strong and can take care of herself.    But what I love the most about Ms. Stiefvater's writing is her ability to depict chemistry between two characters--first with Dee and Luke in Lament and now with Sam and Grace. She's masterful at showing and not telling: glances, touches, dialogue, and thoughts all create a completely believable love between a girl and a werewolf.    Shiver is a perfectly executed book, and I continue to be impressed with Maggie Stiefvater's writing.

0375507256|5.0|An intricate series of somewhat connected stories that begins on a 17th-century ship and culminates in a post-apocalyptic Hawaii, Cloud Atlas is a precisely crafted and challenging novel. Each story ends abruptly, wrenching into the next, moving forward in time like progressive notes on a scale, and then descending back to the beginning.<br /><br />During the upward run, it's difficult to grasp the connections between, say, the South Pacific schooner and a composer's mansion in 1920s Germany, or between 1970s California and a near-future Japan where our clones are our servants. Although the physical connections are apparent--one character in each story experiences in some way the story that came before, such as through discovering and reading a lost manuscript or watching a computer-projected hologram. And it's implied that one character in each story is the reincarnated version of someone who came before. But the theme that connects all the stories--of apocalypse and annihilation of the \\"other\\"--does not become clear until the reader is descending backward in time.
0439023483|5.0|I thought this book was great, it kept me up at night thinking about society and how we act, and having different parts of the book pop in my head and refuse to get out.  One interviewer said something about the 'reality tv' idea not lasting and therefore dating this book, especially once those shows are no longer on our televisions but if you've read Futuretrack Five [[ASIN:0007126913 Futuretrack 5]]by Robert Westall which was written about 25 years ago (I read is as a child and have a copy still) which had a similar reality tv game you realise that this book will become a classic too.  If you love this then read Futuretrack Five, it's an excellent book too with some similar themes but maybe a little less bloody.
B001N26GFM|5.0|First, let's start off by saying that the subject matter is not the easiest and some will find this a difficult film to watch.  But I urge you to do so.  It is a haunting film, one that will make you think and also understand the emotional scope of the horrors that happened in Nazi Germany.<br /><br />The script (adapted from the novel by John Boyne) is tight, the dialog and characters defined as much by what the characters do not say as they are by their words, deed and actions.  The casting is spot on as well, with Jack Scanlon as Shmuel turning in a heartbreaking performance, full off the innocence of youth tamped down by the horror around him.  Likewise, David Hayman as Pavel turns in an understated performance to serve as counterbalance to Shmuel.  Pavel has seen it all, plunged from the heights to the lowest of lows.  He is a broken man and yet he has not lost his humanity.  Asa Butterfield turns in a nice performance as Bruno, the son of the Nazi Commandant, and Vera Farmiga as Bruno's mother gives a nuanced performance as the woman who has her head in the sand but her eyes wide open.  And stunningly frightening is Henry Kingsmill as the explosive Nazi officer, Karl.  And David Thewlis as the steady and determined Commandant is equally effective.<br /><br />The direction combined with the writing is what makes this film really sail.  The contrast between the innocence of the two boys and the action going on about them is powerful, creating a view of racism that seems all the more horrible when seen through the eyes of children who don't understand what is happening, what it all means.<br /><br />Difficult and challenging, this film is an important look at racism and the massive sins of the Nazi regime.  It takes an event which seems both far away and achingly near to us in the time line and creates a truly horrifying and moving portrait of what can happen when madmen go unchecked.  Highly recommended.
0714845183|5.0|One of the joys of reading is learning about people, genres, machines, history, music, politics, and so on that one was not previously aware of. This review is focused on one new experience for me--the art and life of J. W. Waterhouse. I am sure that I have seen his works in one museum or another that I have visited. But I really had no background in the specific school of his art, a Victorian, pre-Raphaelite perspective. As such, this book opened a new world for me.<br /><br />The book is a combination of biography and critical analysis of Waterhouse's art. I am amazed at how many blank spots there are in his biography. He lived from 1840-1917, and the book includes much speculation, for example, as to whether or not he was in Italy at a particular time. One would have thought that someone as well known (as his career developed) would have had few such blanks in his life story. That also, of course, makes this book more intriguing still. The author of this book, Peter Trippi, speculates that Waterhouse's widow, after his death, may have destroyed his records and correspondence, but I'm not sure Trippi has much conviction on that point. And, indeed, if the author is correct, we know very little about Waterhouse's wife, Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse, outside of scraps of information.<br /><br />I am not an artist nor am I an expert on art, so I cannot speak with great insight about his oeuvre. But I am surely impressed with the growth and development of his art over time. Some of his best work is most affecting to me.<br /><br />He begins by painting, using classical themes (e.g., \\"The Death of [Horatius] Cocles\\"), fairy tales/folklore (e.g., \\"Undine\\") , images (so the author suggests), and females (e.g., \\"The Slave\\"). As his work evolved, his art became more subtle and telling (e.g., with the classical themes, see the progression from \\"The Death of Cocles\\" to \\"The Remorse of Nero\\" and \\"Diogenes\\" and \\"The Favourites of the Emperor Honorius\\").<br /><br />The next phase of his career was a major step forward in his work. Some of the major works (which I find stunning and powerful, as one juxtaposes the story with his paintings):  \\"The Lady of Shalott,\\"  \\"Saint Eulalia,\\" \\"Mariamne,\\" and \\"Ophelia\\" (different versions are powerful in their own right). This review is already too long. Suffice it to say that his work continued to evolve.  Section 3 focuses on \\"Myth, Poetry, and Nature,\\" and contains some stunning works. And so on.<br /><br />The point: This volume traces the evolution of his work. The final chapter tries to place Waterhouse in context and make some judgments about his body of work. If, like me, you are not an expert in the work of J. W. Waterhouse, this book is a wonderful resource. Even if you know quite a bit, this would appear also to be most useful, pulling many of his works into one volume while providing a sense of who he was and what his life was like. From my perspective, this is an enchanting volume.forward in his work.

B0002Y4TOM|3.0|The first season of Gilmore Girls promised to be one of the best sitcoms since The Mary Tyler Moore Show. The dialog was witty and consistently good. The characters were quirky, but real. Each of the characters is a flawed, but decent human being (except for Rory who is the perfect young teenager, a serious flaw in reality). The story unfolds showing the strengths and weaknesses of each character in a series of warm, amusing episodes.<br /><br />The quality of the series, however, descended dramatically in Season Two and essentially became a soap opera with dark overtones. Lorelai's mother changes from a manipulative but caring mother who is concerned for the welfare of her grandchild (from her cloistered perspective) to an extremely, self-centered woman whose primary concern is her control over her granddaughter and in the process sabotages her granddaughter's inheritance. Our hero, Lorelai, also develops an unusually cruel streak. She is so thrilled with her mother's discomfort with her mother-in-law (her mother's mother-in-law) that she brings a camera to photograph the event. A key episode is the one in which Lorelai breaks off her engagement at the last minute without the decency to explain why to her fiancée, but rather lets the town gossip break the news to all and sundry. Are men simply objects without feelings in women's soap operas, whose sole purpose is to adore the heroine and disappear when not needed? Escapism is one thing, but escapism that breeds gross insensitivity to others is not something to expect of the heroes with whom we identify.<br /><br />In the first season, when Lorelei was a decent person despite her flaws, her father lectured her on the pain she had caused others by having a child out of wedlock. Lorelai, however, values her independence so much that she opts out of marriage with the father of her child although she loves him (in her self-centered sort of way) and sleeps with him in a later episode. It is interesting to note that of the many characters in the story there is no happily married couple with children. Is this because it might expose the fans of the Gilmore Girls to the happiness that Lorelai and Rory might have experienced growing up with a decent father figure (believe it or not, a key component of the majority of families). It is also interesting to note that in the first season, Rory's boyfriend breaks up with her because of her lack of spontaneous warmth to his declaration of love and she is then bereft and much saddened until they make up several episodes later. Episodes such as these have the element of truth in them. In contrast, in the second season, she puts off a date with her boyfriend because she is busy and promises to meet with him that evening. She later fluffs him off for a very self-centered reason. This time, however, reality gives way to escapism and the boyfriend crawls back with an apology. It doesn't happen that way in reality, at least with young men having some backbone. I gave the soap opera a rating of three stars, this being the average of five stars for the first season and one star for the second season.<br /><br />The sad part of all of this is that Rory and Lorelai have a huge fan base. There are thousands of young women who identify with our two self-centered heroes regardless of their insensitivity (if not downright cruelty) to others and their lack of responsibility regarding their actions. Witty banter does make up for irresponsible behavior.
B000OCZEU0|3.0|Lynne Truss brings an obscure element of language to the fore and in doing so exposes some of the effects of unbridled change in the name of progress.   Her second book \\"Talk to the Hand\\" is even better.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|The producers of \\"Seabiscuit\\" presented a social message in their film: in the difficult Depression years those who were optimistic and overcame adversity were exemplary and emblematic of the American spirit. People needed some underdogs to cheer for.<br />Seabiscuit or as he was affectionately called the Biscuit captured the hearts of the American public because of his come-from behind spunk.<br />Seabiscuit doesn't enter the movie until the movie has told of the lives of three men vital to the horse's story. The entrepreneur car dealer Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) is the man who put the Seabiscuit franchise together, but owning a horse was almost an afterthought to him. The movie traces the early, hardscrabble years of horse trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) and the hardluck journey of a Shakespeare-quoting boxer cum jockey Red Pollard (Toby Maguire).<br />Howard chose Smith to seek out the right horse. Once they had found Seabiscuit, Toby Maguire comes along as the down-at-the-heels jockey who energizes the horse. Both horse and a jockey had a string of bad breaks.<br />At first the horse was cantankerous and difficult to train. Seabiscuit did not have a constant string of victories. He lost the Santa Anita Handicap twice. Howard and Smith became leery about Red when he seemed to pull the horse up in one race, but they forgave him when they learned the truth.<br /> Throughout the later stages of the picture Howard was trying to get the owner of triple-crown winner War Admiral to enter his horse in a match-race between the Biscuit and the Admiral.<br /> When the famous race is finally set, Red is unable to ride the Biscuit because his leg gets shattered. Later in another race when Seabiscuit's leg is injured, the two cripples rehabilitate each other.<br /> William H. Macy has a clownish part as a radio sportscaster who is there to chronicle various stages in the horse's career, but it's a part that isn't an asset to the story.

B000WTNCYA|4.0|I have to admit that I was interested initially in this CD because Melody Gardot is gorgeous.  She has that \\"smart chick\\" look that I'm a sucker for, that Tina Fey/Janeane Garofalo look.  But then, when I listened to the CD, I realised that she's an amazing musician, with a gorgeous voice, and an artist with amazing songwriting ability.  Another reviewer has said this album sounds incredibly intimate, like Melody is in your own living room, and they're right.  Music like this can be done in a very superficial way, almost like \\"elevator musak\\", but Melody is so good and sincere that there's no cliches or superficiality here.  The arrangements are top notch, employing beautiful, understated guitars, violins, lap steel (one of my favorite instruments), and, of course, Melody's voice.  Even the closing instrumental, Twilight, is moving and beautiful.  I hope Melody stays around for a long time, as she's wonderful and beautifully serene.
B001FB55HG|4.0|Christian Bale stars as John Connor in what is now the war against machines. I would have liked if a part for led off from where part 3 ended. We don't get to see how he met other survivors or what led him and Jordan Brewster (Bryce Dallas Howard) to be together romantically. In part 3 they were only told they'd be together in the future. They never actually got together. This movie just starts out with mankind vs machines and Connor and Brewster together. I would have liked a movie that was about where mankind first decided to fight back.<br /><br />  The movie was at least big summer fun though. McG (Charlies Angels) did a much better direction job than I expected. I also liked the plot where John Connor is trying to find Kyle Reese before the Terminators can. They plan to kill him so John is never born. But a lot of the good stuff was mostly done with Sam Worthington's character. We get to know his character and he's the one we feel for. He's also the one involved in some of the films better action sequences. Bale is a good actor but he really didn't have a lot to work with. In the movie Connor basically just barks orders, gives pep talks on the radio and listens to tapes of his mother. Worthington had the more engaging character.<br /><br />  While the relationship between Connor and Brewster could have been built up a lot better. We just know that they are now a couple. They don't talk about what led them to falling in love. I doubt they just did because Arnold told them they would. Here we just know they're in love because they kiss and hug. Bale and Howard barely get have enough time together to even form any kind of chemistry. I did like how Anton Yelchin was used as Kyle though. He at least kind of looked like a young Michael Biehn. The little girl that played his mute friend was good too. I even cared about their fate more than I did Connor's.<br /><br />  I need to say more positive stuff about the movie since it sounds like I didn't like it. I really really enjoyed it as a summer movie. As a Terminator movie it could have been better. But as a summer movie it was a ton of fun and it had plenty of excitement. It was at least a much better film than part 3 and it was a Terminator film that was different for once. All the others had similar plots with the heroes on the run through the whole movie. I don't get why some people say this one is all action and no brains. I actually found it to be a little smarter and more original, well more than part 3 at least. I think part 3 was the one that was basically all non-stop brainless action. The only new thing part 3 offered was the surprise ending.lly enjoyed it as a summer movie.

B00005JLCI|5.0|When this film was released 10 yrs ago on the BIG screen, all who saw Kennith Branagh's 4 hour long 'HAMLET'.... were breath taken. Now \\"thank God\\" we have this epic on DVD.  The cast alone makes this film a must see! Cameos by Jack Lemon, Robin Williams, Charlton Heston, Billy Chrystal,to name but a few, with major roles played by Julie Christie,Kate Winslet..(a young Kate),Richard Briers and of course Derek Jacobi and Kennith Branagh as HAMLET.  It is my belief that this will be the definitive film version of HAMLET and that every serious DVD/video collector should have it in his/her library.  As HAMLET is possibly one of Shakespear's finest plays, Branagh has given it the portrayal and panoramic grandeur that this great story deserves!  I would give this ***** out of five.
044024367X|3.0|I had never heard of the Jack Reacher series previously. I bought Nothing to Lose at the usual Big Box Discount store. I liked the book so I ordered the first six of the series from Amazon.com. I am about one-third of the way through The Killing Floor and I am a little distressed. Nothing to Lose and The Killing Floor, are, for all practical purposes, the same book. Starts out in a diner, arrested in the diner immediately, romance with a local female cop, big conspiracy operation, etc., same in both books. Please tell me that I didn't waste my money and that [[ASIN:044024367X Nothing to Lose (Jack Reacher, No. 12)]]all of the books are the same with the only changes being the names and places, plot remaining exactly the same!
1416914307|4.0|Many other reviews already contain a synopsis, so I'm not going to worry about that. (Also, I don't really want to give any plot points away.)    I haven't been waiting for this book for a long time - when I first read the previous books in the series, this one had already been released. I wasn't a resounding fan of the first two, but Cassandra Clare has definitely grown as a writer; her books have gotten progressively better.    \\"City of Glass\\" was the best in the series. The characters didn't really feel real to me in the previous books, but in this one, I felt that I really understood them. Their personalities have really developed and I can relate to most of them now. I particularly enjoyed the development of Valentine's character in one scene, where he sincerely shows his tender, fatherly side to Jace. I also loved the romantic parts (they were so cute), but they didn't bog down the story or ever become the central plotline. (Although the romances did affect what the characters did.)    Cassandra Clare's writing is very funny at times - she can pull off a little bit of humor even in a dark situation. The characters were hilarious.    That being said, the plot: It was very clear to me how the story would conclude, and I saw most of the plot twists coming. I think that Clare foreshadows overly, which really takes a lot of the suspense out of the book.     Overall, the book was more fast-paced than the others - new events developed very quickly, instead of dragging along like in the previous books. Some of the plot points were very been-there-done-that, but they didn't annoy me overly because the characters brought something new to the situations. The story was also well-layered with little sub-plots, and I enjoyed Jocelyn's flashbacks from the beginning of the formation of the Circle. The ending was tied together very well - a happily-ever-after with little hints to tantalize us about the new \\"Infernal Devices\\" series she's writing about Shadowhunters, set centuries back.      This is a very good conclusion to a series - one of the better ones out of all that I have read. It's definitely worth reading.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Amazing, beautifull and sweet would be the few initial words to comment on this film. Yet another film having a wonderfull and strong chemistry between the two co-stars. Bill Murray at his best, he is an amazing person to watch on screen, he will steal your glance every moment, Scarlett Johansson delivers a very sattisfying performence as well, she was pretty bold and admirable in this film, you just can't lift your eyes off her, what's more... a wonderfull chemistry, neat and decent acting and direction. You can't lift your eyes off the pair in the film. Go ahead, give it a watch, you won't be dissapointed. Its a lovely film. You will realize Friendship is a unique relationship.

1423101499|5.0|My daughter got me started on this series and even though I am retired from teaching ancient history to 6th grade students, I love the subject.  This book and the others are action filled and full of classical references as well as the difficulties of being a teenager, especially with ADHD.  Shows how someone can develop courage and self-respect also.
B001RIY49C|1.0|Pass this up and just buy the regular blu-ray Skynet Edition disc.    In a nutshell:  #1 The HUGE 14\\" tall endoskeleton head bust is CHINSY at best. Details are not horrible but they're not good either.  It's constructed of high impact styrene plastic (vacuum metalized chrome is probably the only plus on this thing).  It looks VERY \\"toyish\\" with some very poor black paint wash applications.  Light up eyes feature is a tad bit cool...sound effects are annoying and too loud at best.    #2 All the extra bonus special feature discs and extra \\"director's cut\\" discs (aside from the actual blu-ray film disc) are just DVDs...that's right...JUST DVDs.  The studio just decided this is a strategic way of getting rid of their overstock of what they've previously released in the past.  They couldn't even transfer all of this to blu-ray?  What's up with that?    #3 Save your 100 - 200 bucks!  The economy is bad.  If you buy this, your wallet might as well be \\"terminated\\".
B001IB63KQ|5.0|This concert just blew me away. It is the BEST live concert cd I've heard in a long time...probably since Eric Clapton & Pink Floyd. And NO I am not joking. Sure Hayley starts out a little sketchy but once she gets going...there's no stopping her. She has an AMAZING live voice. Definitely did not expect her to sound that good live which made me skeptical at first, but I just decided to try it and see if it lived up to all the hype. I was not dissappointed. The dvd of the show was awesome also. I'd have to say my favorite songs from this concert were...pretty much everything, but the ones that stood out to me were:    Born For This(wicked guitar & drum entro and she gets the audience involved right away)    Fences    Crushcrushcrush(the audience does contribute alot in this song, but they were awesome in Chicago, great crowd)    When It Rains(Hayley's spot on)    My Heart(Hayley plays keyboard in this one)    For a Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic(just love it)    Hallelujah(I originally didn't care for this song, but in this concert she starts it out by singing the original by John Cale...and remarkably enough does a brilliant job with it)    And Finally...Misery Buisness a fitting conclusion, as it's my favorite song of Paramore's    So All in all, thic cd/dvd concert just plain rocks and is worth every penny of your hard earned cash.
0743486285|5.0|I have been a Crue fan from their first vinyl, (I was 11) when I read the liner notes I learned just whom I was actually a fan of, Nikki Sixx has been a part of my life for over 20 years. I have seen the Crue live 9 times, 7 with backstage passes, so I shouldn't be shocked. I mean anyone around could see the excess, and the debauchery, but who knew it was that much different from the 'typical life' of a rock star, (Answer: the people who know them as just people, friends, another artist, (or musucian), I figured that out long before this book). I have both 1/2's of Nikki's magnum opus, the book and soundtrack, that will forever stand in alone as the most honest, and brutal humbling of a man, put upon a pedestal, with nothing & noone to help him keep his footing, and not fall.That made it up-on his feet, lived to tell about it, and did so...to help people in similiar situations. I am grateful to Nikki for being so raw, and not making his journey seem like 'a little time to recoup', but what it was/is a lifelong battle- for life! I've a family member with problems this severe, (believe it or not) but she isn't ready to try, she still wants to die. I pray that before she does herself in, she will find a quiet place within, where she is not so very altered a little longer than usual. If/when that time comes, I'll be there for her with these two tools as a gift & guide to let her know she's not gone- it can be done.
0312360266|3.0|I have read every book in this series so far.  And I so far think that Zoe Redbird is a caring yet shelfish charter.  The series it self is interesting to say the least I however dont know about the vampires also being witches thing going on there.... I will finish out the series like I do any series that I start but it will not be on my top series to recommend.  also I wish that they would make the books longer.  I mean I understand that they are geared for young adults but y.a. have read thick books like Twilight series, Vampire Diaries, Harry Potter, ect.  The house of night books could have easily been combined from soon to be 6 books into 3 and saved the readers the headached of trying to jump from book to book.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I am an avid reader that lives for music, so this soundtrack...to a book...is simply genius, as is Nikki Sixx! The soundtrack gives you a musical journey that was (and at times is) his life. There is such pain and misery, recovery, and healing, as well as major deception, truth, and becoming truly humbled by all. The music on the soundtrack is this complex, intricate, and brutal, after all... it wouldn't rock if it wasn't! A true 1/2 of a magnum opus, by Nikki & those that lent a hand, (with both 1/2's), job well done!
B00008MZ0O|1.0|it's a good movie seen it before but there is a white box in the lower right hand corner thru the entire movie and it is really annoying!
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|This is the best Rock album(in general)since before the 'flannel began to fly'! NICKELBACK is accomplished enough to have produced this album with fantastic results, but with MUTT LANGE at the (producer/songwriter) healm, the results are truly astonishing!NICKELBACK fans will love it because, YES every song rocks! Just to be fair, this album just may have the ability to put Rock back in the forefront of music. This is a must-have for any true rocker, (NICKELBACK fan or not), it's a Mutt Lange album, every song is a potential hit single, it's good to hear his genius (ROCKIN')again- Welcome Home!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I haven't been as good as I would have liked but man is it a tough work-out. I can definitely feel it after the 20 minutes.
B0015UKX7E|5.0|This concert is so good. It gets boring at times but overall it's a very good excellent concert to watch. He does some old songs (Purple Rain) and he does some new songs accorrding to when this dvd came out (The Greatest Romance Ever Sold). This DVD comes with innerviews and some bonus clips of the concert which is cool. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to sit for over 2 hours to watch Prince and his friends perform.
B000P0J024|5.0|Good price, good product, good price, good service. No complaints.[[ASIN:B000P0J024 Traveling Wilburys (2 CD / 1 DVD)]]
B001M5UDGS|4.0|In classic Joss Whedon style, \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" tells the story of goofy wannabe supervillain Dr. Horrible (Neil Patrick Harris) and his unrequited love for pure-hearted, altruistic Penny (Felicia Day) who he meets at the laundromat. It is also the story of narcissistic superhero Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion), Dr. Horrible's nemesis and a massive jerk, who almost by accident earns Penny's affections. We quickly learn that polar-opposites Horrible and Penny are really kindred souls, wounded idealists who feel the world's imperfections too deeply, while Hammer is a self-serving, unfeeling clod willing to step on anyone to get a bit more notoriety. (He is a less-savvy but also less-corrupt cousin of Captain Amazing from \\"Mystery Men\\".) The unstable triangle between Penny, Horrible, and Hammer leads inexorably to a tragic conclusion -- but there's lots of singing (most of it on-key) and sly humor to enjoy along the way.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Dr. Horrible\\" is very nice, a lot of clever fun. The songs in \\"Dr. Horrible\\" are musically and structurally much like those in the musical \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" episode \\"Once More, with Feeling\\", which is worth checking out ... if you know enough about Buffy to be able to make sense of them.<br /><br />A high point for me was the duet between Neil Patrick Harris and Felicia Day in \\"My Eyes\\", where their musical harmony belies their diametrically opposed views of the world --<br /><br />Horrible: \\"I cannot believe my eyes / How the world's filled with filth and lies / But it's plain to see / Evil inside of me is on the rise\\"<br /><br />Penny: \\"I cannot believe my eyes / How the world's finally growing wise / And it's plain to see / Rapture inside of me is on the rise\\"<br /><br />Well done!
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm has really backed up every argument he makes with solid support evidence and strong case studies. The best book I've read this year.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Buffy fans will like this CD.     I really like it.  Very pleased with the extra tracks not from the episode and the bonus track was neat.  The cast of Buffy did a great job.    There's 23 tracks;  total time play, about 57.3 minutes.    CD came with an 18 page  booklet containing  artwork and photos of the cast. There are a few pages by Joss Whedon where he explains a bit about the musical, and the bonus track  his wife and he did.  Lyrics and the names of the characters who sing the lines are included.  Yes, the lyrics to \\"The Mustard\\" are there.    There's no sound effects like in the show.  For example there's no bottle smash sound in \\"Rest In Peace\\".  Wasn't sure I'd like it without sound effects but  turns out I do.  It makes it nicer to listen to.    In  \\"What You Feel\\" the part where Dawn asked the demon if he's just bringing the fun in, is not there.  Maybe because it was a spoken part.  However, the part where she sings about how she doesn't want to be late, is in the song.    The song \\"I've Got A Theory / Bunnies / If We're Together\\" has an ending to it, \\"If We're Together\\", that is nice and about a minute long.  I don't recall it being in the show.    There are three cool instrumental tracks, (two with some vocals), from other episodes. One track from each of these Buffy episodes; \\"Restless\\", \\"Hush\\", and \\"The Gift\\".    By the way, it's great music to listen to while playing \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and/or \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Chaos Bleeds\\".  Really; listening to the CD, and hearing Sarah Michelle Gellar singing \\"Going Through The Motions\\" or \\"Something To Sing About\\", while you're kicking some vampire butt is just cool.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|After seeing one of the songs performed on youtube I had to have this album. It is simply great. The concept of piecing together performances from around the world is nothing short of brilliant. I've shared it with friends who are also amazed. Lived up to all my expectations and more.
B0000DZTIW|3.0|I already know I like some of the tracks but being that my order has not arrived yet (a month in waiting) I cannot not critique on the entire track.
B0017VG69U|5.0|With graphic enhancement and a restored master, these shows are worth watching again and again, even if you saw the original broadcasts like myself.
0375842209|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  The writing style is unique and the story, although based on fact and a terrible time in our history, besides being vivid, was warm and humorous.  The charactors will stay with me for a long time to come.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|The digital and graphic enhancements are great. Disk has a duel side. One is regular DVD and the other is HD DVD which I haven't found anything to play it yet. Season #2 and #3 wisely dropped it. They did not give instructions to load the disk label down to play DVD. I thought the disks were defective.  The price is finaly affordable! Great viewing.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Action that literally takes your breath away.  Puzzles that make you think HARD and then wonder how you DIDN'T see that solution.  Clipped sentences.  Like these.  Addicting, really.  So don't whine about the price.  You need this satisfying fix of Lee Child's Reacher the way I need a cup of coffee in the morning.  Sure, we could skip it.  But then we'd be irritable and groggy when we could be happy and engaged.
0596009208|2.0|Okay so I spent almost 30 minutes looking over the reviews here on amazon and I read both the good and the bad.  I drove down to the bookstore and checked out the book myself...I spent over an hour and a half in the bookstore looking through this book and here's my take:  This isn't per say a \\"beginners\\" book.  As a matter of fact, on page xxx of the book (yes roman numerals) it gives you three questions to answer to see whether this book is for you or not!  It's NOT for people who have never done programming, only dabbled with html and what not!  Also not for C++ people either.<br /><br />After that, I went on ahead through the introduction only to be slightly confused.  Granted it tried a little too hard to be cool at explaining java terms and concepts that I had a \\"Wtf are you talking about\\" moment.<br /><br />It's a very thick book and like one reviewer said, it had way too many notes and sidenotes and sidenotes to the sidenotes that made me go, \\"Wait what?\\"<br /><br />Bottom line: If you already have some sort of intro to programming and want to learn java then this book is for you.  If you are an absolute beginner and have absolutely no knowledge of programming or have dabbled in it AGES ago (like me), this isn't for you.  The book even says so itself.  The reason why I gave it a two is because it advertises itself as if it's going to teach you java from scratch but no it doesn't.  Plus the whole \\"cool,\\" with cool stories and too many sidenotes and pictures and cartoons approach just doesn't cut it for me.  I think it's a bit too much.  I mean there's a kids computer programming book out there that I browsed through that was more sophisticated and straight to the point than this.
1591840562|5.0|This is a no nonsense book about starting your own company. Kawasaki cuts to the chase with his candor and humor. I highly recommend it especially to startups.
B000AXWV40|5.0|i almost can't listen to this album it's so freaking good. i will put this on repeat for so long that i burn myself out on it and don't pick it up for another year, when i just do the exact same thing! if you're not into funkadelic i don't think this is the place to start, but if you're into any sort of (and i hate to use this word) \\"underground\\" music you'll love this.
0887307280|5.0|This book opened my eyes to what I was doing wrong and very shortly after putting these principals into practice, everything turned around for us. I highly reccomend it to anyone who owns, or is thinking about owning, their own buisness.
1591840562|5.0|This book was recommended to me several years ago, actually by Kawasaki himself during a presentation about presentations. But I haven't picked it up til now and I am so regretful that I didn't read it when he told us to! Every sentence is jam-packed with information that is directly applicable to any entrepreneur. Granted he refers to some technology experience, but mostly it's about the process of hitting the road running. I highly highly recommend it for those who have brilliant ideas and not moving fast enough on getting it out into the world.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I own a small business that carries video game accessories and I decided to give RealTriggers a shot.  As a PS3 owner, I have been a little frustrated with the R2 and L2 buttons, but RealTriggers changed that in an instant.  It takes about 10 seconds to snap them on, and they only snap off if you really want them to.  They are shaped perfectly, and feel natural against your fingers.  Perfect item, easily worth what Amazon is charging.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|I just watched this tonight (5-22-09). I just had to say, as others have noted, that the 'making of' feature was excellent. I don't know if I've seen a better one in regards to how a movie developed and got nurtured along the way. Very insightful.    Also, I'm so glad that Sydney Pollack did this before he died (just one year later). He and the rest of those responsible for this film are to be commended.
B0027P77CU|5.0|FIRST IMPRESSION:    Just finishing my first-ever trip through Devin Townsend's \\"Ki\\" ... and already it feels to me like his best work to date.  All the best elements of his previous recorded output combine with a deceptively simple (but never simplistic), often groove-oriented approach that (for me) hits all the right buttons.  This project rattles back and forth between melodic and (somewhat subdued for DT) heavy blues-oriented material that has a bit of bite here and there but never loses its composure.  Clean/acoustic guitar gives way to heavy, leading into ambient, which slides into moments that are almost David Gilmore-esque, then to back to blues, but this time with a touch of rockabilly ... and yet somehow it all make sense!  The Pink Floydian flavor is most evident on \\"Quiet Riot,\\" but can be felt through much of the project.    Of course, given that this album is the first of four interrelated releases, each with its own stylistic identity, I'm already looking forward to the NEXT chapter of the \\"Devin Townsend Project\\"!    I may return and add to this review once I've spent some time with the lyrics, but for now I'm gonna recommend this one on the strength of the music and performance.  Well worth a listen!
0783226888|4.0|Here is an almost-typical modern-day crime film in which a hired killer goes after a political figure and the FBI tries to stop him.    The cast of Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier and Diane Venora is first- class. All of them play interesting and likable characters - even the villain! Gere did a credible job with an Irish accent and Venora the same, playing a Russian. It was fun watch Willis with his various disguises. The story keeps your interest all the way. It does it right by not having too much action, but shocking and memorable when it does occur. If you have good speakers there is some great sound in the last 20 minutes. A good movie if you like suspense.    If I mention some of the \\"bad\\" stuff, it gives away the ending.  Suffice to say you see a number of scenes where credibility goes out the window.  Overall, however, the film is definitely worth a look.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|This is my opinion, has been one of the best seasons of Smallville. Season 7 was good, but Clark was facing the same problems over and over and over. It was getting so old. This season is a breath of fresh air. So if you had given up on smallville a few years ago, you should definatly watch this season, because it is amazing!
6305126062|3.0|Here's a beautifully filmed \\"horse opera\\" about a New York teenage girl (Scarlett Johannsson, who is now a well-known actress but wasn't when this was made) and her horse, both of whom are badly injured in a mishap and are healed by a Montana horse expert, played by Robert Redford.    Redford also directed this film and being such an outdoorsman, you know this is going to show nature in a beautiful way....and it does. The Montana scenery is just awesome.    After a dramatic opening scene in which we see the horse and daughter hurt, the mother (Kristin Scott-Thonas) takes the girl and the horse out West to see if the horse can be salvaged. Unfortunately, the mother - who is married - falls for the horseman \\"Tom Booker\\" (Redford) and an adulterous relationship almost comes to fruition. That romance is the soap opera part of the film but it's nice to see everyone, including Redford's character, healed of emotional as well as physical wounds.    This film is a bit too much of a melodrama at times which makes it a long in spots, but it's a long movie to begin with (169 minutes). It's so beautifully filmed, however, that for that alone the movie is worth seeing.    I sure hope someone makes a sharp Blu-Ray disc of this film. It would be truly awesome to view.

B00004U8JV|3.0|Of the three Jurassic Park films, this was the only one I thought didn't match up to the others, but was still entertaining and offered the normal amounts of thrills and amazing special effects.    The dinosaurs are so life-like that they are always fascinating to watch. The baby T-Rex is particularly realistic in this adventure story, as are the little bird-like creatures. The story was so-so. I think a better ending would have been a shot of the big reptile in front of the San Diego skyline, which could set up the sequel of the beast loose in a big city, but the ending was still okay....just could have been better.    Also, there was too much action in here. Some - not a lot - should have been cut out. At a little over two hours, the film can wear you out. Despite the above remarks, it's still a fun-scary-tense thriller and the DTS sound is superb.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I thought for sure \\"Sex and the City,The movie\\" would not compare to the fantastic HBO series,but its great,and I'm looking forward to part 2 next year.  The ending is Brillant.You almost hold back tears,then the music starts,and the  gang is back together again.  I don't know how these girls do it, they look more beutifull now then when the series started over ten years ago.

0345495004|4.0|I have to say that this is an excellent fiction based on true facts novel. It's a great read and interesting with an ending that I hardly expected. I didn't know very much about Frank Lloyd Wright before reading this book. It's sort of a neat peek into the seven years he spent with a lover. How she affected his work and how she lived her own life.
B000VSBX34|3.0|A few quips, some jump cuts and a few arch scene transition titles do not offset my impression that here is an above average Elvis exploitation movie starring the Beatles. Somehow, I never saw this one until now. It's not remotely comparable to \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\" The silly plot about an Indian death cult trying to recover one of Ringo's rings wears thin fast. Still, it's delightful to see the Fab Four in restored, glorious color. The songs are great, but are just gratuitously stuck in every 10 minutes with no relation to the plot. Worse, the Beatles don't bother to even pretend to be playing along. They are out of synch, especially Ringo who doesn't bother to stay on the beat, his cymbals flailing every which way, his drums set up in absurd locations like some rocks at the beach or a military plain. Film looks like it was just duped yesterday, though, thanks to the great restoration. Thankfully, you can cue just the songs on the menu and skip the filler in between.
B001CTDH4Y|4.0|This movie isn't exactly what I expected from the cover art, the descriptions, and clips. I figured it would be funny hijinks with dogs all blinged / dressed up in Beverly Hills. Instead it's a retelling of most of the Disney live action movies of the last 10 years. Even with that hackneyed approach, the film was still funny.<br /><br />Our hero dog, Chloe is spoiled rotten by Jamie Lee Curtis. Jamie Lee leaves for Europe and needs somebody to take care of Chloe. Rachel, played by Piper Perabo, seems responsible at first. She turns out to be phenomenally dim witted, gets convinced to see Mexico with her friends. And while there, Chloe escapes and is kidnapped by the dog fighting crew. And the road trip / escape movie happens.<br /><br />The voice talent is good. Placido Domingo is a big surprise. George Lopez was my favorite. It's a star studded cast of voices, the dogs are all well represented. The live actors are not too bad. Piper peaked with Cheaper By The Dozen. She did well as a dim bulb, but later in the film she gets some smarts and is not so good in that role. Jamie Lee is, over the top stupid rich.<br /><br />It's another mindless escapist movie. There's nothing socially redeeming here, although it does try to be preachy at times.<br /><br />Classic PG Disney. There's double entendres for the adults (and I kind of hate that). There's stupid slapstick humor. And the plot is simple enough that just about anyone could follow along.<br /><br />Mindless entertainment. Many adults will probably say the film is awful. A 13 year old by and a dad (going on 13 years old mentally) enjoyed the film. Mom, not so much. Actually said it was awful, but she watched the whole thing.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is a film most know was way ahead of its time. And only really appreciated too late after people woke up. The Blue-Ray conversion from the original is as good as it could be and way more detail and found myself almost sinking into the picture with that much clarity to see than the non HD version. The 5 pack is so vast on everything(almost)you ever wanted to know. A true bargain to say the least for the price and will always wonder how this was never made into a sequal? Instead all those \\"rappers of the lost arch\\"???<br />The BEST...........<br />There is still music that was never released and that would be so incredible to hear....please Vangelis!<br />I am afraid that it will be a very long time if ever that this quality of a movie ever comes to screen again sadly.
B000SQJ2SC|4.0|I wasn't a K.W. fan before this CD. From listening to samples of his prior recordings, I think that K.W. has came a long way in the recording process and the production department.<br /><br />On this disc, nearly every track is of the utmost quality regarding the writing, recording and production.<br /><br />I like rap, yet I like it fused with dance, pop and r&b. 'Graduation,' has this going for it. The mix is great.
9707704667|2.0|When I was last at my parents' house I saw a copy of \\"Travesuras\\" on the bookshelf and figured I might as well read it. Why not? Vargas Llosa isn't my favorite writer, but I'd really enjoyed his novel \\"La guerra del fin del mundo,\\" and besides \\"Travesuras\\" was apparently about a translator living in Paris (at the time, I too was a translator living in Paris). But in the end this coincidence wasn't interesting enough to overcome what, for me, was simply pedestrian writing.    Let me say in its favor that the book is an easy read (none of the abrupt shifts in point of view MVLL was once fond of) and it is not pretentious. I also kind of liked one of the main character Ricardo's translator colleagues, a madman who spoke a dozen languages and advised Ricardo not to try to understand what he was translating (sound advice, to be sure, but I still had to laugh). The evocation of London in the early 1970s was convincing, too, despite a minor character's possibly anachronistic death of AIDS.    For me, the great problem of the novel is its lack of tension. Ricardo gets the girl when they are in their teens, after all. Call me machista, but from that point it seems to me his life-long pursuit of her is simply anti-climactic. MVLL doesn't bother to make Ricardo's obsession convincing. In fact, at each of the \\"bad girl's\\" sporadic reappearances I groaned inwardly, as it meant departing from some mildly interesting descriptions such as those of London or of Ricardo's work. Sometimes it also meant being subjected to vulgar sex scenes, with nothing sexy about them. (I wonder if MVLL's two erotic novels are as unsexy as the sex in \\"Travesuras.\\" As it happens, I have also recently read the Colombian Santiago Gamboa's \\"El síndrome de Ulises,\\" an otherwise engaging novel marred by vulgar sex scenes. I am no puritan; for me, Casanova sets the standard for explicit erotic writing, Karen Blixen for implicit. MVLL and Gamboa serve up warmed-over Henry Miller.)    An odd thing too was howmuch \\"Travesuras\\" called to mind the work of Julio Ramón Ribeyro. The opening reminded me of Ribeyro's \\"Relatos santacrucinos;\\" la chilenita's story reminded me of Roberto's in Ribeyro's story \\"Alienación.\\" Ricardo, like Ribeyro, worked in Paris at UNESCO. If MVLL's evocation of Ribeyro and his work was intentional, it was certainly a dangerous move. \\"Travesuras,\\" after all, would only suffer by comparison: I don't think anybody who has read Ribeyro's stories would prefer \\"Travesuras.\\"     I thought about giving this book three stars, but I still hadn't finished it as my stay at my parents' house was coming to an end. When it was time to leave for the airport I still had ten or fifteen pages to go. I give it two stars because when I put it back on their bookshelf, I realized I had no regrets whatsoever about leaving those few pages unread.

B001UREJWM|3.0|Musically superb...louder drums & grind please...  Lyrically is Dio at his usual...he's had better days; I love his early solo stuff  Vocally sounds great for his age...TOO LOUD in the sound mix making this a Dio album with BS guest players. H&H/MR was a BAND; Dehumanizer Dio started bitching and egos flared. Here Dio gets the BS album he's always wanted and thinks he deserves with him WAY out front of the sound mix. I swear there are places where the background riffing turns down when Ronnie comes on.    Was never too hot re Ozzy (but own it all mainly for Iommi); love the first Dio/Sabbath material; like a bunch of the Iommi-only remaining as Sabbath era; love much of the Martin era. Disappointed overall its OK...more Iommi and slightly quieter Ronnie. Thanks.

0439023483|3.0|Hunger Games is a castrated, overly cautious novel hyper-sensitive to the supposed \\"sterile\\" minds of young adult readers. As such, it misses the target so artfully set up by Suzanne Collins.    The storyline of Hunger Games has a lot of potential. Even though, as other reviewers have articulated, the structure and content of the plot is similar in design to many other stories (The Running Man, The Lottery, Battle Royale, etc) it is creative enough to stand apart from those others mentioned, it is innovative, in my mind, rather than imitative. However, Ms. Collins kept the story limited and somewhat uninteresting by the predictability of the plot. She overly foreshadows events and sticks to a generic structure instead of being creative with her readers. There are few twists of fate and those that were included were obvious.  This could be forgiven, if there was more substance to the unraveling of events. Unfortunately, there wasn't.    As events play themselves out, Katniss gives rather unimaginative, scripted, and kiddish (like 10-11 year old) responses. One of the advantages of choosing a first person narrator such as Katniss is that the author can show the psychological struggles being endured by the protagonist. Katniss is put in a horrific scenario, forced to kill other children, but her responses, to me, are too generic. I never get a real sense of her pain, I never feel like her thoughts are the genuine thoughts of a young adult (14 year old) forced to do the unthinkable. Instead, Ms. Collins sticks to \\"survivalese\\" and has Katniss thinking, for the most part, about herself and the necessity of hunting for food and finding water. This too could have been pulled off effectively, but again, I never got a real sense of dread from Katniss. I never truly sympathized with her situation, partially because the details were too sparse and sterilized, and secondly because I knew she would pull through it - the storyline was overly predictable.     I think Suzanne Collins wrote the book in the way she did so that young minds would be able to think about this world instead of live in it. Therefore, she sterilized the content so as not to overly excite or offend her young readers. Unfortunately, this has the effect of making a necessarily interesting story, boring. When I heard this was going to be a story about kids forced to kill other kids because of pressures forced upon them by an oppressive, sadistic government, I thought this has got to be good. I expected gruesome detail, deep thoughts, and harrowing experiences. After finishing the story, I wasn't satisfied in any of the anticipated ways. Instead, I was left with the sense that this book was written for an audience much younger than the 14 and up audience I was led to believe it was for.     5th - 6th graders, I believe, would find this book enjoyable as the plot is fast moving and somewhat intriguing. 9th - 12 graders would find this book to be a castrated shell of what it could be if truly written for an older young adult audience.
140015328X|2.0|Woz may have created a nice computer but he was not the first to create a personal computer. There were several out there at the same time. If it had not been for the TRS-80 from Radio Shack and their advertising money, Apple would have gone the way of many of the original pioneers.  Interesting read but very conceited, really about Woz growing up.     To get a true picture of the original days of the micro computer revolution suggested reads are [[ASIN:0979346800 Priming the Pump: How TRS-80 Enthusiasts Helped Spark the PC Revolution]] and [[ASIN:0071358927 Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer (Second Edition)]]. Both of these are more truthful about the history and should be read by anyone interested in how the personal computer industry came about.    I was there, lived it and co-created the TRS-80 that truly sparked the personal computer industry.
1400031362|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first two volumes in The Ladies No.1 Detective Agency series; however, this entry was a huge disappointment. What can you say about a book where there are not only plot inconsistencies across volumes (Precious's father left her 180 cattle in volume 1 but that number is given as 2000 in this volume) but within the volume itself (the Government Man clearly says of his youngest brother, 'He is my brother of another mother.' However later on in the book the Government Man's mother is claiming the youngest son as her own and no further mention is ever made of the 'other mother'. Further there are plot stubs that go nowhere as far as I can tell -- the Lion Boy, Ms. Makutsi's brother and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's illness. Seriously, seriously disappointing.
0312370849|5.0|In the summer 1942 under the Nazi occupation orders, the French gendarme violently arrest Jewish families.  Amongst those brutally rounded up is ten year old Sarah and her parents Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski.  Before Sarah is grabbed, she hides her four years old younger brother Michel inside the apartment's cupboard expecting to return rather shortly to free him.<br /><br />On the sixtieth anniversary of the intolerance dark Vel'd'Hivs, fortyish American expatriate journalist Julia Jarmond is assigned to write an article about this day of infamy.  Her research finds her connected to Sarah through the apartment she and her womanizing spouse Bertrand Tezac reside in; as that was where the Starzynski family lived before the snatch and the Bertrand brood took occupancy.<br /><br />This is an incredible look at a dark moment in French history as seen by a reporter six decades later following the tragic footsteps of one Jewish family.  The cast especially in WWII is super as the audience will feel they are with Sarah and her family from the moment the cops raid their apartment.  Julia is also a terrific protagonist as she refuses to bow to pressure from her in-laws or fianc&eacute; to end her research or look for someone else.  Although Bertrand pales next to the journalist and the Starzynski brood, fans will appreciate Tatiana de Rosnay's haunting profound glimpse at the day Paris sold its soul to the Nazis.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B000VBJEEG|5.0|I bought this for our children, ages 12 and 15, but I fell in love with this movie myself.  It's absolutely delightful!    The animation is excellent. The expressions and movements of the characters are wonderfully realistic. The backgrounds are done beautifully as well - it truly did look like it was \\"filmed\\" in Paris!  Very authentic.    The characters are perfect!  It's easy to feel affection toward Linguini, the bumbling would-be chef, and I found myself cheering for Remy (the rat) as he helped Linguini concoct dishes to help keep the floundering restaurant afloat.  Collette was one of my favorites; her disgust at having to help that fledgling cook was quite apparent at first, but little by little, she begins to show her soft side as well.  I liked her.    This is a terrific movie for the entire family.  It will keep the young ones laughing, and dazzle the adults with its excellent animation and characterizations.  Definitely recommended!
B001N18HOG|5.0|This is the disk set to get if you love Pearl Jam. The Redux disk has added additional songs the original doesn't have. This hasn't left my car since I got it, I haven't watched the dvd yet.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Extremely well done with interesting commentaries from D.C. Fontana among others.  Both the (painstakingly restored) original and the artfully updated special effects versions are included - it's as though a fan custom ordered them and I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to follow - I hope that they will see fit to treat the movies as well in a future Blu Ray release.
0385340575|5.0|On a nearly vacant Manhattan subway train, former MP Jack Reacher notices the female passenger acting odd.  She shows all the nervous signs of a suicide bomber as proscribed by the Israeli military, an occupation by definition always means first timer.  The Israreli list of signs contains eleven points in common between the genders; this woman has all of them as the local train heads from Bleeker St. with stops in between towards Grand Central.  Absurd as he thinks it is, Reacher follows his gut and calmly confronts her.  In her bag is not wires, but a gun she pulls out and points at him before turning it on herself blowing away her head.<br /><br />NYPD Detective Theresa Lee questions Reacher especially about the Israeli list that led to the \\"false positive\\" suicide. Detective Docherty offers a different scenario accusing Reacher of homicide, but the vet calls the cop dumb insisting they are stalling until the Feds arrive.  When the FBI does they question Reacher before walking away.  Leaving the precinct, he is accosted by four men wanting information and after that by the victim's brother, who insists his sister would not kill herself.  Before long Jack finds himself pulled in two directions; one back to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the other into the heart of the global war on terrorism; neither make sense, but Jack knows his mission is to kill the bad guys before they cause harm.<br /><br />The opening sequence as poorly described above is brilliant as Reacher is pulled into an international mess one step at a time.  The story line gets even better as the tension mounts as Reacher finds himself caught in the middle.  Fans of the series will believe GONE TOMORROW is one of the best entries (that says a lot with the consistency of this series) while newcomers could not ask for a better introduction to the world of the nomadic former MP.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000T0XEGS|5.0|This is still the best dvd version of Traviata on the market.  I own five others, including, Netrebko, Fleming, and two with Gheorghiu, but none of those versions (which certainly have their strengths, both technically, and vocally) express the full gamut of the emotional power and the pathos that is at the heart of this great opera-tragedy.  It's all here:  Stratas, Domingo, and MacNeil singing and acting wonderfully; Zeffirelli's opulent movie staging [including a couple of unique treats:  1.) having Teresa Stratas made up to look like the classic portrait of the actual Marie Duplessis upon whom her character is based, and 2.) opening the movie with a scene that mimics the opening scene of Dumas' novel, wherein the late-and-lamented courtesan's effects are being carted away, after having been auctioned off to pay her debts].  Last, but certainly not least, Verdi himself seems to be guiding James Levine's baton.<br /><br />This 2008 DG dvd copy of La Traviata (theatrically released in 1982) is obviously meant to replace the 1999 dvd (Universal Studios) version.  There are some distinctions, however, and they are not unimportant.  For one, the sound has been improved.  Two, the 1999 version was shown in widescreen (1.66:1), this one is fullscreen (1.33:1); it appears to me that the film was originally filmed in fullscreen and then clipped on the top and the bottom to properly fill a widescreen commercial movie screen (I've read that some directors like to shoot their films this way, and Zeffirelli must be one of them).  Be that as it may, a bit of the right and left edges of the 1999 film are cut off here, but there is more top and bottom displayed in this newer dvd [so, we're actually seeing more picture content, but--paradoxically--in a smaller area (4:3)].  Three, the ridiculous [bracketed] closed captions, indicating \\"[laughter], [music playing], [finale], etc.\\" have mercifully been eliminated from this new version.  Four, the DG dvd is less expensive.<br /><br />On the negative side:  even though the picture quality of this new version seems a little better than the widescreen version, it will never (ever) be mistaken for blu-ray, and two, there are (as with the 1999 version) some lip-syncing issues.  Lastly, although I think that this fullscreen version is slightly superior to the 1999 version, there is definitely something to be said for watching a film that fills your widescreen TV.  Enjoy!<br /><br />UPDATE (1-2-11):  For what it's worth, I noticed that Amazon has lumped the reviews of all three video versions of this performance together (i.e., the 2008 and 1999 DVDs, and the older VHS).  It goes without saying, therefore, that any of the 80-plus reviews written prior to 2008 relate to either the 1999 dvd or the older VHS tape./>On the negative side:  even though the picture quality of this new version seems a little better than the widescreen version, it will never (ever) be mistaken for blu-ray, and two, there are (as with the 1999 version) some lip-syncing issues.

0316017922|5.0|This author clearly has a gift of drawing together diverse academic studies and weaving them into a narrative that is at once simple and complex. He succeeds in giving us a powerful picture of what makes people succeed.<br /><br />I was grabbed by the introductory chapter and the book kept me engaged until the end.<br /><br />As a Christian reading this text, it strikes me as a book in praise of virtue and in condemnation of vice. That may be an odd take, but I think it is clearly present throughout the book.<br /><br />The book throughout praises the ethic of hard work, noting time and again (especially in the area of mathematics and rice patties) that hard work matters more than almost anything else.<br /><br />Yet, while praising hard work the author also shows clearly how worldly success is the result of a complex serious of demographic, cultural, and historical occurrences. He uses the word humility only once or twice. But it is a powerful concept. Those who are outliers owe their success to many, many factors, and individual merit is not the only factor for success.<br /><br />As a homeschooling Christian who is also a school teacher I was struck by the data on our schools. I was heartened by the recognition that yes, in fact our schools do work. I was also entirely convinced (despite the ease that it affords me) that summer vacations are a horrible idea for kids from poor or lower middle class backgrounds, and that perhaps we ought to be redesigning the schools' academic calendar to be more efficacious. My home-schooled kids are way ahead of their public schooled counterparts (I see this plainly when I go to work, and then come home and see what my wife is achieving at home). One of the main reasons is that we school year round in our household. My kids see \\"summer vacation\\" as the time daddy helps teach.<br /><br />Thus, the book struck me as a work that praised both hard work and humility, while warning against sloth and pride. That is a good message that has been around for quite some time.<br /><br />A great and thought provoking read.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Being a big fan of the movie, I decided to pick up a copy of the new blu ray edition of T2. All I can say is wow! This is the edition to get it has both versions of the film all one disc. The picture quality and sound quality are outstanding and look amazing for an older film. It does rely heavily on BD-Live so if you have an older blu ray player, you could run into some problems if you don't update your firmware.
B0024F08RO|1.0|*SPOILERS*    Thank God they pulled the plug on this show when they did. I'm PISSED enough that I wasted FOUR YEARS following Prison Break only to get that piece of CRAP ending. What a TOTAL disappointment!!     I quit Prison Break for awhile when they killed Sarah. I felt really betrayed and knew there couldn't be a happy ending for Michael with her gone. But the writers seemed to see the errors of their ways and brought her back. HA! Fool me once... And look what I got for my naivete... Doubly betrayed and an ending that SUCKED HARD!     In the group I watched it with, people were too incredulous to cry. I know I was totally taken OUT of the story with anger at the writers. Again. As the credits rolled the room was SILENT and then the reaction quickly went from unbelieving to disgusted to mad.    I have PB season 1-3 for sale... CHEAP! Not only will most viewers remember the show with bitterness, but I'm sure the DVD sales will be dismal. Serves them right.    I'm so angry - I seriously doubt I'll ever watch a FOX series again. They try so hard to be edgy, they've become CLICHE.

B000006OBQ|5.0|This is Frank at his peak and Big Band Jazz near its finale.  He just turned 50, he's working with the legendary Count Basie and his orchestra (jazz big band), he's at the Sands (which was torn down years ago), and you can hear all the room sounds (glasses clinking) because of the small number of omnidirectional microphones used back then to record live events.  His voice is mature and his timing is perfect.  The live events in NY and NJ recorded some 15 - 20 years later don't compare, nor do his albums from the late 40's and early 50's where he still sounds like a youngster.  This is the sound and voice that you want in your head when anyone says, \\"Did you ever hear the Chairman of the Board sing live?\\"  I only wish that he had sung \\"All of Me\\" instead of it being a Basie band instrumental (they do a great job of course) but the words to this song are timeless.  The other instrumental, Makin Whoopee, is a lesson for every trombone player on how to use a plunger mute.  Within a few years of this recording, The Beatles and The Byrds and The Rolling Stones would change the music industry forever with rock replacing Big Band Jazz and singers like Frank, Dean, Sammy, and Tony Bennett (still performing) as the mainstay's of the top 40 on radio for the previous 30 years.<br /><br />One final note:  Play this loud to get the full effect of the Basie Orchestra and make sure your system has a sub-woofer so the bass can pump your heart for you, tilt your right ear down towards the ground on the odd beats and snap your fingers on the even beats... now you're ready for real big band Jazz and Frank - the way it was and should be.

0385341008|5.0|This book is really SWEET in just the right amount. It is like savoring your favorite dessert or licking the bowl clean when you're baking a cake. It reminded me of Fannie Flagg's Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe: A Novel in its feeling and sensibility. It's hard not to like this book a lot.<br /><br />The novel is about a London journalist and writer named Juliet who forges a relationship with the people of Guernsey (a British Island in the Channel Islands between France and Great Britain). She finds out that they were occupied by the Germans for five years during World War II and formed a literary society at the same time. She begins a correspondence with some members of the society and friendships are made. In fact, the entire book is formatted as a series of letters from and to Julia by the people of Guernsey and her oldest friends. The people of Guernsey are eccentric and wonderful. You'd love to have most of them as neighbors or in your book club.<br /><br />Juliet is a delight. She is open-minded and curious. She survived the bombings in London but her flat was destroyed. Her publisher is Sidney. Sidney and his sister, Sophie, are Juliet's best friends. The Guernsey crowd consists of Isola who makes potions and does phrenology; Dawsey is a pig farmer, a lover of Charles Lamb and a Jack of all trades; Eben is a stalwart survivor raising his grandson; Amelia is the kind-hearted matriarch of the island; Kit is 4 years old and Elizabeth's daughter; and then there is Elizabeth, the glue that holds the folks of Guernsey together.<br /><br />Mary Ann Shaffer, one of the two authors, states in her acknowledgments that &#34;...art - be it poetry, storytelling, painting, sculpture, or music - enables people to transcend any barrier man has yet devised.&#34; She has succeeded in bringing fruition to this statement with this novel.

B001H9MYPW|5.0|'In Treatment: Season Two', is as riveting as season one. Gabriel Byrne, as Paul, continues as the impassioned psychologist, dealing with a new set of patients.  He sees a female college student with lymphoma, a boy whose parents are divorcing, a female attorney who he was his patient twenty years prior, and an aging company CEO .  Meanwhile, he continues to have both clinical supervision and personal counseling with Gina, Diane Wiest.<br /><br />Paul struggles with many of the same issues that were difficult for him in season one - - boundaries with patients, his marriage, his relationships with his children and anger and dissatisfaction with his personal and professional life.  On top of that, he is being sued by the father of a patient from Season 1.<br /><br />TV series do not get any better than this.  As a clinical social worker and marriage and family therapist, I can vouch for the authenticity of the sessions.  Therapists are human beings and 'In Treatment: Season Two' reminds the viewer of this with every episode.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|beautiful, energetic, electrifying album by these rock'n'roll-blues legends! Awesome hammond organ playing, fiery lead guitar by a rejuvenated Clapton, and unbelievable guitar dialogues in some of the songs with Winwood contributing his own personal guitar touch. The band is very tight, magically connected with amazing bass guitar playing and fantastic drumming!! Didn't miss Mr. Baker at all... you really can't ask for more! My favorite track: Glad, from Traffic's \\"John Barleycorn must die\\"; what a treat! and my only complaint: why the \\"heck\\" didn't they perform \\"sea of joy,\\" the best and most underrated song of the memorable Blind Faith album..?
0385340575|1.0|As a preface I will state that I have read and enjoyed every one of the previous Reacher novels. But this latest offering by Lee Child fails to deliver [even though he does make sure that there is enough excessive blood and violence at the end of the book]. One of the key characters in the book, a U.S. congressman, tells Reacher that \\"Bin Laden knocked down the Twin Towers. He attacked the Pentagon. He is the world's worst terrorist.\\" Reacher, this most highly intelligent killing machine, does not dispute what Congressman Sansom has said. But the FBI most certainly did as it has refused to place bin Laden on its Most Wanted List for being the [alleged] mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks. That is because they have stated that they do not believe that there is enough evidence, despite the propaganda put out by Bush and Cheney [and which Cheney continues to put forth], to link bin Laden with 9/11.     One has to wonder why Sansom's aide Springfield, who has connections to many of the various intelligence agencies, did not inform the congressman or Reacher that no jets were scrambled until the drama of 9/11 had played out. How did the [alleged] 19 hijackers manage to shut down NORAD, the FAA and the air force? It is extremely doubtful if bin Laden, hiding in his cave thousands of miles away in Afghanistan when this happened, managed to somehow make this happen. Why did Reacher not inquire of the congressman how these [alleged] hijackers, all of them between 5'5\\" and 5'7\\" tall and of slender build, managed to overcome the flight crew and the rest of the passengers, not with Uzi submachine guns or with pistols, but with box cutters. Why does Reacher not know that 99.9 per cent of the wreckage of that plane that supposedly hit the Pentagon was never found? Perhaps Reacher should become connected to the Internet to realize that he has been had.    The point of all this is that we have Jack Reacher, a person who is very quick [justifiably] to usually question authority, nowgoing along with the official conspiracy theory put forth by the U.S. government. This simply defies credibility that Reacher, this most intelligent of fictional heroes, would have blindly accepted the story that John Sansom was spinning. Reacher eventually discovered that the bad people were lying to him but yet is loath to believe that his government would lie to him just as I was lied to when I and hundreds of thousands of others ended up unnecessarily and unjustifiably in a place called Vietnam.    It would appear that Lee Child's characters should be more respected for their intelligence than the way that they have been portrayed by their creator.
0385341008|5.0|A well written book that keeps your attention throughout. Keeps your attention and is a great summer read. Highly recommended.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Based on a true story from the writings of a young man who goes on a summer trip out west but does not return home, call or write to his family and basically drops out. The film opens in the remote alaska wilderness where he is living off the land, but shown in flashbacks is his adverturess journey through the west for two years of getting to that point. What makes the film work is the interesting people that he meets along the way and they are ones you will not soon forget. Beautifully photographed and directed, this personal drama is thoroughly enjoyable and a worthy purchase.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved this book so much I even lent my precious Kindle to a friend so she could enjoy it. This is a happy, fast reading book. By the end, I felt like I was friends with all the characters. Sure, it's lightweight but sometimes that's all you want out of a book. This is the perfect book for someone who needs to ESCAPE from the drudgery of everyday life. It would be perfect for vacation reading - wish I was on a beach when I was reading it but it was just as wonderful on the bus going to and from work. It's a HAPPY light hearted book. No drama, no big surprise ending, no intricate twisty plot. Just a feel good, make you smile book.

B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A was realesed right at the turn of the millenium and sounds like the music of the 21st Century and is one of the few albums of this millenium and century that have become truly classic albums yet. Kid A takes a huge experimental leap from the bands, \\"OK Computer\\", realesed three years before this album. Kid A combines rock with music like, ambient, electronic, and space music and combines it to make one of the most interesting albums ever realeased. The album starts out with, \\"Everything In It's Right Place\\", even though everything on that track is not in its right place, with everything being mixed with pro tools. The title track is probaly one of the best tracks on the album containing distorted vocals and futuristic space sounding keyboards its a song that makes you think about the future and Earth's place in the Universe. Other songs like, \\"The National Anthem\\", \\"How To Dissapear Completley\\", and \\"Idioteqque\\", are also worth hearing. The one song on here that really stands out is, \\"Treefingers\\", which is a 4 minute ambient song that abruptly stops and goes straight into a more rocking song, \\"Optimistic\\", that makes you jump out of your seat every time hearing. Kid A is an album worth hearing inleast once in your life and will be music that will still be popular 50 years from now, so if you want to hear what music will be like or be influenced from in 25-50 years from now listen to this album.
0618680004|5.0|And it was fantastic. Well-written, well-reasoned and enjoyable. The one part that got a little hard to get through was the section on what is needed to form a planet/solar system required to sustain life -- it went a little longer and deeper than I would have preferred. No doubt this will be the favorite part of the book for people with a greater interest in that sort of subject.    The \\"people of faith\\" who have posted negative reviews here without even reading the book crack me up. They actually help validate one of the main points of the book and show the very reason why people in positions of power and authority who make decisions or (\\"God\\" forbid)policy are so dangerous to humanity.    Kudos for the few detractors who actually have read it.
B001TH16DS|4.0|I've been a fan of the original series for many years. This set definitely makes the old Trek new again! It looks and sounds beautiful. I only have two negative comments about it. 1) They should have done something to remaster the opening \\"space..the final frontier\\". It sounds very tinny. 2) I would have liked the previews of shows to have been remastered too.  But other than those things, I highly recommend this set to any Trek fan.
B00005ABIP|3.0|3 1/2    Following what is mostly referred as their best, PTM does prolong the intellectual grooves the band emits so well, though signs already become apparent the band was leaning towards a radio-refined palate with ready made, predetermined arsenal in tow.
B0000A118M|5.0|Coltrane's, \\"A Love Supreme\\", is more than a jazz album its a spiritual journey or as Coltrane had said, \\" A Love Supreme is a gift to God\\". There are only four tracks, \\"Acknowledgement\\" ,\\"Reseloution\\", \\"Pursuance\\", and \\"Pslam\\". The album is only 32 minutes but is still a timeless classic that can be listened to over and over and over again and it still will captivate and influence you. Being for its short length, \\"A Love Supreme\\", allows you to hear John Coltranes spiritual journey and lets you hear his gift to God. A Love Supreme was and still is pure genius and was a jazz album that was way ahead of its time and it still is ahead of its time, never has there been a jazz album realesed that has sounded remotely close to the pieces heard on this album. Also its influence has been widespread not just to the jazz community but also to rock muscians like, Carlos Santana, and Bono of U2. Sadly though we never did get to hear Coltrane make more albums like this as he died of liver cancer at the age of 40 with plans of becoming a monk. A Love Supreme is classic, beautiful, definitive, spiritual, timeless, and did I mention pure genius. A Love Supreme is an essential album for anyone who likes to listen to music to listen too on the face of this planet. So what are you waiting for go out an pick up this album and blast this album and let it change your life.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I just got this set, and I must say it's incredible how clean and cristal clear this movies are. I was skeptical at first, because many negative reviews, but I wanted this collection in Blu-ray, for some time now, and I'n not dissapointed.  The sound is incredible if you have a good sound system, and the image is pristine is you have a 1080p/24p capable TV.                           Don't listen to the nay sayers out there, buy it now!

B000001Y5X|3.0|While most of Manson's self-absorbed stabs at edginess subside in proportion to one's years lived, his debut came mildly packed with more honest rock influence than anything the progressively convinced artist produced afterwords, and besides a viable follow-up, is possibly the only recording of merit.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer realeased in 1997 at the start of the computer age era has a very approiate title. Realesed right at the end of the last millenium this album proves to be one of the few albums realesed in the last 12 years that deserves the title \\"classic\\". Containing 12 songs from hard rocking space age(Airbag) to a spacey song about a subterranean homesick alien(Subterannean Homesick Alien) to a song about a paranoid anndroid(Paranoid Android) to a song about such a thing as a \\"karma police\\"(Karma Police) all the way to a song with a robotic voice that is \\"fitter happier\\"(Fitter Happier), obviously from the descriptions above this is an album worth listening too inleast once in your lifetime. OK Computer also is among every classic space age rock album like, \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"2112\\", \\"Fragile\\", and \\"Moving Pictures\\", etc, OK Computer is bassicly \\"Prog Rock: Second Generation\\". Songs like, \\"Airbag\\", \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" , \\"Paranoid Android\\", \\"Climbing Up The Walls\\", and \\"Karma Police\\", are for the ages and have the abillity to be listened to over and over again and yet still be able to facinate and influence someone who listens to it. OK Computer is also a mere hint of what was to come on the bands next album Kid A which you will love if you loved this album. All in all OK Computer is one of the few albums realesed that many people consider one of the best albums of all time.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Angelina Jolie has captured the world with her beauty, her intriguing lifestyle and the mystery that surrounds her very existence.  Some say it is a carefully crafted image and others that she is simply a very private exocentric person.  Whatever the case, when viewing this film you see Jolie as nothing but the character of Christine Collins.    In Los Angeles in 1928, after returning from work, Christine Collins discovered that her 9 year old son was missing.  The film chronicles the battle that Collins wages with the LAPD to find her son.    Jolie truly delivers and Oscar worthy performance as the relentless and passionate mother who stops at nothing to find the truth.  Her shear determination is inspirational.  Exceptional detail was given to cinematography and making the setting and date believable.  If you are not a fan of Jolie it will not stop you from being moved by this film.  \\"Changeling\\" is a very powerful film and brought Jolie's talents to a new level , and it is a film that she should be proud of.
B001TODCII|5.0|This is one of those movies that the old summer blockbuster always wanted to be. The scene where he shoots the cop's wife is out of control, and sums up everything that is good about Luc Besson and the French action flick. Like Bourne, like Jack Bauer, but all in a good way. Check it out!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you are open enough to appreciate this type of humor, this will become a favorite.  The writing is excellant with most of the true humor below the surface.  Plus, do Not miss the \\"Musical Commentary\\" amazing that they took the time to write a complete 2nd set of songs instead of a simple and typical commentary.
0385341008|5.0|It's the kind of fiction that gets you on your computer googling, researching, reading more and more and more!  The characters are wonderfully quirky and interesting.  The voices in the letters are each so unique that you feel like you're reading many different and engaging stories at once.  Anyone who is interested in WWII will love this book.  Anyone who is interested in people, love, heartbreak, motherhood, loss, triumph and the human spirit will also love this book!
B0011UF792|5.0|If you are a Kevin Smith fan you will love this edition of Dogma. It's basically a Blu-Ray version of the Special Edition DVD, but well worth it if you have a HD-TV!
B000001EGE|5.0|With two American top ten singles, one of which became his biggest British hit up to that point by peaking at number two, this album marked a major step forward in Elton's career.<br /><br />The set opens with Honky cat, which was only a minor hit in Britain but much more successful in America. Next comes a wonderful romantic ballad (Mellow), followed by an up-tempo song with a very downbeat lyric (I think I'm gonna kill myself). Another up-tempo song (Susie) follows, but this time the tempo of the song reflects the lyrics. We then come to Rocket man, the most famous song on the album and still one of Elton's most recognizable songs.<br /><br />The next track (Salvation) is about seeking spiritual help to overcome life's problems. A look at slavery from the victim's perspective (Slave) is performed at a slow tempo, having originally been recorded at a much faster pace. The faster version is included here as a bonus track. A song about infatuation (Amy) precedes an unflattering song about New York (Mona Lisas and mad hatters). The final track of the main album (Hercules) finds Elton musing about a woman. The only bonus track is that faster version of Slave, because there were no other unreleased tracks from the sessions.<br /><br />This is one of many excellent Elton John albums, that all committed Elton fans should regard as essential.

1842171593|5.0|I've purchased a dozen military novels and resource manuals on both the ancient Roman and Greek militaries and I have to say that this book has been the best one in my library.<br /><br />If you're a historian buff, school student, reenactor, or just out to learn more about the Roman's armor, weapons, shields, etc... this is THE book for you.<br /><br />The layout starts by discussing the different evidence found and then jumps into the various periods of the Roman civilization. You get to see the advancement of the weapons, armor, structure as it morphed over centuries. Each point added is backed up by actual evidence found in digs throughout Europe and the Middle East. You get to see the items as they were when they were taken out of the ground in all their glory and learn all the necessary characteristics about them.<br /><br />I can't begin to explain how great of a reference this is. I had never read the original printing (my copy is the re-print) but it came highly recommended to me as I want to get into Roman reenacting. If asked by anyone else, this would be the book that should be at the top of anyones list.<br /><br />While I think each individual section could have been longer with more examples... I still think it's one of the best out there. Don't let the pricetag push you away from purchasing it. It should be on the shelf of anyone interested in the Roman civilization.
1400076943|4.0|Kambili is a teenager growing up in Nigeria in a family where her father rules with an iron hand, where duty, family and religion are elevated above all else. Where love is frequently spoken of but seldom practised. The contrast between traditional and modern life is distinct. When Kambili and Jaja her brother visit her aunt in another town, things change, the same things are important but this is a loving household where they somehow manage to marry the old with the new, and instead of God being an oppressive figure, there is affirmation even rejuvenation and questioning what is taught is encouraged rather than punished. This is a coming of age story that many readers will enjoy.There was a surprise at the end I did not see coming, it was shocking but then again that is what makes a good story teller. Pulling one out of the bag when the audience least expects it. In the end Kambili emerges more grown up, confident and in control of her destiny.
6305907145|2.0|but no one associated with this movie could possibly have actually read Mansfield Park.  All the charm, the conflicts, most of the story, and all the sense have been removed.  What is left is a hodge-podge of a movie that tries feebly to take on the issues of slavery but falls far short of success, while missing the entire point of the original story.
B000KGGIQY|5.0|a wonderful movie about 2 of the greatest country/western stars ever...johnny cash and june carter shared a love so passionate that after june passed away, johnny lived only a few months after.  the m. usic, the passion, the problems they overcame, 2 people immortalized forever in this story.  joaquin phoenix and reese witherspoon were the ideal people to play these people on the screen and certainly did justice to them as icons of the music business.
B001TODCII|1.0|Let me first state that this is not a review for the Movie but a review of the DVD's case. I purchased this movie from a best buy in Fort Worth Texas. When I purchased it I was surprised at the flimsiness of the Case. When I opened the Case I found out why. In order to be more \\"Green\\" and save plastic the case had holes cut into it. on the front a recycle symbol and on the backside of the case they have removed the area directly behind the disc. So in other words the only thing that protects the disc is the plastic sleeve and the paper cover.
B000IOM0WE|5.0|Blue ray is beautiful, and this is a very vibrant film.  I suggest this as a good demo to show off to friends and family.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Very excellent collection for blu ray compared to the SD DVD available now in both quality and price.  There is very much debatable on its true HD picture for films except Star Trek II.  Since I am but a few of fans of the first film, it was a joy to finally see a much cleaner version of it.  To me the theatrical version is far superior and flows better than the directors cut.  Another good thing is the first film does follow \\"To seek out new life forms and new civilizations\\" much more than the films to follow than being all out phasers/photon torpedo shootout with familiar Star Trek villains.  It was to follow similar deep sci-fi films like 2001 and Solaris to name a few.  In all a great purchase.  Possibly Paramount can do better.

B001IQDAO8|5.0|This is what I would call a concise video biography of country music legend Hank Williams.  It covers his life from beginning to end with video, pictures and a narration that includes comments from those who knew him, saw him and experienced his music and persona.  Included are comments from his children Hank Jr and Jett Williams, Drifting Cowboy band member Don Helms, singer Billy Walker, country music's Merle Kilgore and music historians.  I use the term concise because this video biography covers all the major high and low points in Hank's life and career.  For a Hank Williams,Sr fan it is a must and for those who want to know about Hank Williams this is a great starting point.
B000BAQ8A0|5.0|For a day in which dark clouds envelope you, if any theatrical event can lift your spirits, this is it. Rossini is Rossini and I have nothing to add to that. The librettist gave him every opportunity to shine and he did so. The cast ranged from very good to excellent, making the most of their iconic numbers and handling the others with an aplomb which gave a full measure of pleasure. The production was right on target with sparkling colors, vivid action, and fitting sets. What made it all work was the creation of scenic and  costume designs which were contemporary neither to Rossini's nor our times, but rather were pure theater. Presumably there are those to whom the vocal embellishments intrinsic to bel canto grate. They had better go elsewhere since that is the essence of song here.  For the rest of us, this is a version of one of the standard works which truly glitters, no moss, no dust, no age blemishes; simply joy.

Most of the recommended practices in this book are things I've either learned from others or arrived at myself.  However, if I had read this book 35 years ago, it wouldn't have taken so long.<br /><br />Simply put, this is the best book on software I've ever read.  Not only does it cover the various tricks of the trade, it does so in a narrative style that is easy and fun to read.<br /><br />All software developers should read it, but I'm also going to strongly recommend it for non-technical software managers as many sections make compelling arguments for the sorts of investments whose value might not have immediately seen value to non-technical types.<br /><br />Again, best book I've ever read on the art of software.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|This movie, Cloverfield, deserves every star it gets. Its one of those movies that you can watch a million times and it would still be excellent. It has a twisting, horrific, exciting plotline. The entire concept of Cloverfield seems completely real besides the fact that Manhattan is still standing. The producers have done a fantastic job of making this movie seem real. It is all shot on a hand-held camera, with shakeycamera work and no music giving the feeling that your really watching a tape someone picked up in central park. The producers have also added some interactive real life add ons for some die hard fans. 4 stars, all earned perfectly.

0316067598|4.0|Personal accounts of heroic events are many times the stuff of books and movies and Lone Survivor, by Marcus Luttrell, is such an accounting. The ambush that he and his fellow soldiers encountered in the steep canyons of Afghanistan is a thrilling and action packed accounting that makes this book a good read. The camaraderie between the combatants is also the stuff of legends and Marcus's unending respect for his fellow soldiers and friends shines through in crystallized form.<br /><br />The book starts off with a war hero seeking out the loved ones of those who have fallen - a sense of duty that is presented so sincerely. It is obvious that the duty of Luttrell is so heartfelt and so real that the memory of that sense of duty is burned into the minds of the readers forever.<br /><br />Luttrell is a Texan and proud of it. He walks us through some of those Texan experiences in the early pages and though, a bit long, they are a useful background for what is to come and what comes is a gruelling accounting of what it takes to be a Navy Seal. The accounting of that week of torture is a real eye-opener and one that makes an ordinary human wonder why - why would anyone subject themselves to such pain and mental anguish? Of course the answer is obvious and that is that the desire of the individual is so great and the determination to succeed to intense, that nothing will stop a Seal.<br /><br />From the hell hole of Hell Week, to the battlegrounds around the world, the life of a Navy Seal unfolds and it is in the final chapters of the book where the impossibility of putting the book down becomes real. The survival of Luttrell and the death of his buddies is told with an angst that only a survivor can portray.<br /><br />Lone Survivor is an excellent read and look into the world of a Navy Seal. Although I tired occasionally for the in your face attitude of Luttrell who clearly has a strong opinion of what is right and wrong, the story told is worth trudging through these occasionally somewhat obtrusive views. There are all kinds of people in this world and the Navy Seal is indeed a different kind of person. Luttrell does a very good job of showing us just what kind of a person the Seal is.<br /><br />L.A. Little, Reviewer for TA Todayews. There are all kinds of people in this world and the Navy Seal is indeed a different kind of person.

B001FD5KJM|5.0|I have watched this movie at leasst once a week since it was released on DVD,I saw it on screen.  SOmeone was paying attention when they made this one.  I was a kid in the  60s an read a lot of Marvel comics on a regular basis. (Missed the X-men,but they are boring and lame)  This film come as close to perfect as the medium can possibly get  for capturing the spirit of the REAL Marvel comic.As well as beating out EVERY other superhero move EVER made.   OK the first spiderman came close, but SFX werent quite there (The series deterioated rapidly)   The nearest experience was when the first Superman came out (yes a totaly silly movie now, )  People criticize it for  the  \\"building the armour scenes\\" those scenes gave the film its total feeling of being very real and believable. Robt. Downey was great.(He will be as  remembered for the role as Clayton Moore is for the Lone Ranger!!)  The story took priority over  flash and SFX. I know that is dangerous in these days when brain dead ADHD teens are the main target for most film makers these days. If you have truly lived (born before 1960!) this is the best . (The Dark who!?)    Iron man will be remembered when  the loser who plays batman (Christian  \\"EFFING\\" who?\\")   is  doing appearences at grocery stores!
B001AN2BMG|5.0|I absolutely love this album! I found this after reading the book \\"The Dirt\\" by Motley Crue and looking at \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" by Nikki Sixx. I have owned it for two weeks and can't stop listening!
0385341008|5.0|This book was an unexpected delight.  I did not expect to have so much sheer joy reading a book composed entirely of letters.  I thought that the book would quickly get old, and that I would be bored.  I could not put the book down.  I was transported to another world, and for a mother of three young children, this is something wonderful!  The characters are fabulous and so well developed and authentic.  They are a delight to learn about and very entertaining as they are so unique and humorous.  As a writer and a lover of classic books by Jane Austen and others, it was a joy that the characters had so much fun reading and talking about literature.  It was an escape for them during what must have been a 5-year nightmare--the Nazzi occupation of their British island.  I have always thought of books as an escape and a way to travel outside your problems to another world, and the book delivers this message beautifully.  I also truly enjoyed the romance between Juliet and the pig farmer.  Such an unlikely couple, but the connection between them is beautiful and authentic.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  When I finished it, I felt like I had to say goodbye to good friends.  You will be amazed how intricately and beautifully a story can be told through letters.  Simply wonderful!
B001DF68MA|5.0|I couldn't find this product in local stores so couldn't imagine how it looks like or fits on a bike. But the reviews here did help me make a decision and I ordered it from amazon.com. Note that this product includes the mounting bar. I found the guide could have had better pictures to make it easier for install but since the assembly itself wasn't that complicated I was able to install the mounting bar and the seat with ease. I was amazed how easy it is to mount and unmount the seat from the mounting bar. Also you will really have to see how small the seat actually is. For a better feel, just go the weeride's site to see pictures and video. I have a 26\\" Mens' NEXT PowerX Dual-Suspension Mountain Bike and had my own suspicions bcos of the rear suspension but it fitted well and my first day experience was great. My 18 month old enjoyed the ride. The only thing to mention on the negative side is that you will have to pedal with feet a bit farther apart than normal but it wasn't that big of a deal. I could hardly feel once I got along with the ride. Overall I think it is a great product.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|sometimes i read reviews to make a purchase, sometimes i read reviews to hear the choir on shared/ differing opinions. but while hearing this album i can't really see what people could have against it. though we all come to albums from different past albums, so if you haven't heard this this and this, some albums may not affect you the way it would to other people. that's simple right? i think it is. well anyway, this album is just wonderful. it restores a little (just a little) faith to modern guitar made music, more importantly it shows that young people CAN make good music these days, though these guys are the only ones i know of, lol. it is sweeping like the beach boys, the crosby, association, and other comparisons are a great starting point to describe. though in the end it sounds like people that listened to great music and were inspired to try to reach the heights of their influences, do they make it or dare i say surpase them? that's for you to decide, but i think history will be very kind to this album. i hope they don't misstep with their next release, which seems impossible NOT to do after such a majestic release. if you LOOOOOOVVVVEEE the beach boys, and folky-type 60s music, then you will probably be in as love with it as i am listening to it as i write and you read.
0143113100|5.0|This book changed my underatanding of how the human brain works and it gives hope to many who struggle with learning disabilities and other brain problems.
037582913X|5.0|This book is one of those classic books.  My husband had it as a kid and loved it so he had me purchase it.  My 7 and 2 year olds absolutely love it.  The Monster at the End of the Book has become a bedtime ritual.  Great book to add to any kid's collection.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|Very good collectable item for any fan. For not fans, it is also a great purchase since the original release was a breakpoint between classic/glam rock and grunge in the 1990 decade.
0340920939|5.0|So it goes, most books are better than the movies. I had watched the kubric version many many times before reading the book, and there is just so much unexplained in the movie and there is a lot left out... one thing that made the book better to me is how much halloran and danny talk to each other in the book, as well as, you learn more about the hotel, the hedge maze is the movie is actually a scary menagerie in the book. The read is so scary i cant tell you how many times I was startled just having someone talk to me. Then my copy, thanks to my new chihuahua, was missing the last chapter... it took me a month to buy another copy. Well beyond worth the read!!!
0891419195|5.0|This truly is an excellent first-hand account of two of the bloodiest battles fought by the marines in WW2. No strategy or whole-picture chronicles here, however it gives an insight of the daily life of soldiers I never found in other books. Sledge tells us of the real face of war and focuses on some aspects we never think of when reading about battles, such as life in the rain and mud in Okinawa, or the smells and noises of battle, the stripping of enemy dead, and most of all the fear and moral decay of frontline troops. It is also very well written; it's neither falsely \\"politically correct\\" nor \\"gung-ho-smash-the-nips\\". overall a very good book, I highly recommend it.
0380730405|5.0|I'm a shy girl myself, so I really felt like I could relate to the main character of the book. I could understand the paranoia she felt, her over-sensitivity of what others thought of her, and her feelings of not fitting in. I believe the major points to the story was was to show how the main character finally gains complete confidence in herself and confidence in her husband's love for her.<br /><br />One of the most memorable quotes is when the main character realizes how foolish her fear of people was:<br />\\"I wondered how many people there were in the world who suffered, and continued to suffer, because they could not break out from their own web of shyness and reserve, and in their blindness and folly built up a great distorted wall in front of them that hid the truth.\\"<br /><br />To tell the truth, it was hard for me to get past the first chapter or so, but once you finally get to the main story it becomes much more interesting. Right when I finished the book, I actually went back and read the first chapter and finally understood how it all came together.
0061148512|5.0|Flat out one of the best novels I've ever read.  I've read her poems before and never really cared for them.  I'm going to go back and read a few now that I have a perspective on who she was.    I saw one reviewer say he/she didn't understand how people found this novel thought provoking or moving.  Well, I wouldn't consider it either one for me.  What I did find was a candid story about a deeply troubled teenage girl in the first half of the twentieth century.      This should be on high school reading lists long before Tolstoy's eloquent yet stale Anna Karenina.. just to name one off the top of my head.
B001NESPHC|5.0|This CD is very good. I was impressed with \\"Worrisome Heart\\" but this is one just sucks you in. \\"Lover Undercover\\" is my favorite track. Be ready for this CD. It gets in your blood and you begin to feel it rather than hear it.
0316017922|5.0|One of the best books to come along in years.  What I like about this book is that the author reveals something new about a topic that has been written about ad nauseam. Bringing facts together in unique ways not only proves his ideas but makes them more substantial. Why I like Gladwell's books is that he writes in a compelling style rather than boring us with how great he is himself -- he makes it about the reader -- not himself.  Great forward thinking book!
