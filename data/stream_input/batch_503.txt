0316168815|5.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is the tale of Susie Salmon, a 14 year old girl who is raped and murdered by a neighbor in 1973. Her tale unfolds from Heaven as she watches life go on without her and her family crumble.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" was an absolutely amazing novel. I cried at one point for Susie. The man she knew as Mr. Harvey is really a serial killer that lures her to an underground dungeon and then rapes, murders and dismembers her body. Susie begins telling her tale from Heaven. Heaven is different for everyone, Susie tells us and hers is a High School without teachers. Susie's body is never found except for one of her elbows. The story was truly heartbreaking. At one point in the novel, all of the victims of Mr. Harvey meet in a field in Heaven, and Susie sobs for the loss. I cried with her. It was tragic and engaging all at the same time.
B0006L16N8|5.0|When I first heard Coldplay's latest CD I was initially disappointed with it.  They are one of my favorite groups, and I was afraid X&Y didn't live up to their previous CD's.  Upon first listening to it in full, I felt like many of the songs all sounded alike and ran together, some even sounded like U2.  But, I persevered and listened to it over and over again.  Like a good red wine, this CD needs some warming up to appreciate it fully, sip by sip.  Now that I know this CD intimately, I can attest that it is great.  One of the particular differences with X&Y compared to Parachutes and Rush of Blood is this album is much faster paced, the drum beat is steady and quick, with a lot of cymbals, a departure from their usual dreamy sound, though this CD is still full of that same dreaminess, heightened by the voice of Chris Martin.  But, I sense a confident attitude and a tightness in the entire album, most songs have that telltale Coldplay sound to them, but some have an energetic beat throughout rather than a rambling sleepiness rampant in their previous CD's. <br /> <br />One of my favorites is the second track \\"What If.\\"  To me this is \\"The Scientist\\" of this album.  Starting off with Martin's solo with the few piano chords and then into that dreaminess that Colplay is so good at, the falsetto \\"ooh oohs\\" and then the song comes into it's own with the bass drum beat and electric guitar.  In my opinion this is probably one of the best tracks on the CD.  It's pure Coldplay. \\"Square One,\\" \\"White Shadows\\", \\"Low\\" and \\"Talk\\" are good songs to listen to, with bouncy beats to them, nice background music while doing something.  \\"Fix You\\" is another favorite, but initially it reminded me a bit of \\"What If.\\"  In any event, it's a good song and the way it swells with the harmony after the beginning, it moves you while they sing \\"tears streaming down your face\\", it's uplifting to listen to. Then Martin's solo voice at the end brings it back full circle and it comes across as a really good song.  Another favorite is \\"X&Y\\" which has become my \\"Yellow\\" for this CD.  It starts off with the sing song style of Martin and before you know it, it's grabbed you with the longing of the electric guitar and then those \\"ooh oohs\\" again that get me with the straining guitar and piano.  It's just a great, dreamy, take you away Coldplay song.  This is the song to just lie back and let it wash over you. \\"Speed of Sound\\" is probably one of my least favorites songs, only because it reminds me too much of \\"Clocks\\" and it sounds like a throwaway single they wrote.  It's not bad and it's a catchy tune, but there are others on the CD that are much better.  \\"A Message\\" I love.  To me this is the \\"Green Eyes\\" of the album.  The acoustic guitar and Martin's singing got me from the very first time I heard it.  I knew I'd love it.  It then moves into to that driving \\"Clocks-like\\" beat only without the piano.  It's just an overall great song for the guitar.  My other very favorite is \\"The Hardest Part.\\" It's got the piano and a nice melody and it's just a great happy song to listen to.  The last three songs are not bad, but my least favorites. \\"Twisted Logic\\" has a Beatles-esque \\"She's So Heavy\\" sound to it.  \\"Till Kingdom Come\\" is a nice song, especially knowing the story behind it for Johnny Cash.  \\"Swallowed by the Sea\\" is nice, the song grows on you as it's gets further into it. <br /> <br />Overall this a great album if you give it a chance.  Don't write it off too early.  Listen to it a lot and get to know it and you won't be disappointed -- you'll be delighted!
0312983867|4.0|Hard Eight by Janet Evanovich is the 8th (as the title indicates) installment in the Stephanie Plum series. This time around, Stephanie is not on the trail of a bond jumper, but is doing a favor for her parent's neighbor Mabel. Mabel's granddaughter and great-granddaughter have gone missing and Mabel asks for Stephanie's help. Stephanie soon learns that the reason behind the disappearance is more complicated that it appears and Stephanie is dodging bullets, watching her car get fire bombed and finding dead men on her sofa. It's a race to a finish you will not believe!<br /><br />Hard Eight is not my favorite Stephanie Plum novel to date, but it was completely action packed and totally engrossing. And there was of course the added bonus of Stephanie and Ranger finally sleeping together. She has a lot more resistance than I would have! I just adore these novels and I recommend that anyone who likes a good mystery try on these for size.
B000002UJQ|2.0|I've heard 'OK Computer' enough to realize how utterly overrated, derivative, and hyped-up it is!  This CD is anything but 'groundbreaking' or classic.  All the sound schemes and progressions are nothing that hasn't been done better or with more passion and talent by progressive bands like Pink Floyd or The Church, who by the way, paint much more musical and moving soundscapes than the very mediocre Yorke and company!  Besides, his drony, whiny voice gives me a migraine, much like the overrated bloke in 'Oasis'!
0743454537|5.0|Anna Fitzgerald is the primary character in Jodi Picoult's \\"My Sister's Keeper.\\" Anna is 13 years old and was conceived to be a perfect genetic match to her sister Kate, who has a rare form of leukemia. Over the course of her young life, Anna has been used by her parents like a car that has been stripped for the parts. And now, Kate has gone into kidney failure and Anna's parents are forcing her to donate a kidney to her sister. Tired of never being asked about her participation in the medical procedures and generally feeling invisible, Anna sues her parents for medical emanicipation, a move that tears her family apart.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult is an amazing writer. This was the first novel by her that I read and I was completely blown away by her writing style. Not many authors can make me cry, but cry I did as I reached the end of the novel. Picoult employed the use of multiple narrative voices in a way that I have never experienced before. Each character became real to me as I heard their individual voices. My Sister's Keeper is a beautiful and elegant novel.
B000957O82|2.0|This movie has three parts Will Smith - you just slide, you just slide, wild wild west, gettin' jiggy withit - one part Queen of Kings fat guy with funny black-guy-shows-fat-white-guy-how-to-dance scene.  The scene is funny cuz white guys don't know how to dance, get it?  Ha ha.  And finally, this movie has one part -fill-in-the-blanks here today, gone later today, female actors portraying various romantic interests... <br /> <br />But the best part of this movie is the surprise ending!  As it turns out, \\"Hitch\\" - Will Smith - is dead!  He's really just a ghost - the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock!  Its a total shocker!
1573228737|3.0|\\"Affinity,\\" by Sarah Waters, is a dark Victorian novel that takes an interesting look at the Spiritualist movement and the Victorian prison system. The protagonist, Margaret Prior, ventures to Millbank Prison to council the prisoners and make them be fine, respectable women like herself. Inside the prison, Prior meets Selina Dawes, a spirit medium with the face of an angel. Prior and Dawes strike an unusual and sensual friendship which threatens to unroot Prior's whole world.<br /><br />\\"Affinity\\" was definitely not what I expected. That is not to say I did not thoroughly enjoy it. I am a huge fan of the Victorian novel, so I was very pleased with this fan, although I admit it took me quite some time to actually bring myself to read this novel. Affinity sat on my bookshelf for almost a year and I just could not pick it up and read it. The time obviously came though.<br /><br />The look at the Victorian Gaol system and the Spiritualist movement was quite interesting. Also of interest were the lesbian undertones in this novel. The novel is very female-centric with all of the emphasis on female relationships. Margaret is very obviously a lesbian. She was in love with her best friend, Helen, who was apparently in love with her at some point, but forsakes Margaret for Margaret's brother, Stephen. Margaret and Seline develop a lesbianic attachment to each other that goes beyond simple, female friendship. The way in which Waters conveys this relationship to the reader is rather ingenious. Waters is an author I will definitely be keeping my eye on.

0385338082|5.0|Sophie Kinsella's latest novel \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\" relates the hysterical tale of Emma Corrigan and one plane ride that changes her entire life. After a disastious meeting in Scotland, Emma has a few to drink in the airport and on the plane. When the plane hits some turbulence and Emma thinks she is about to die, she blurts out ALL of her secrets to the man sitting next to her. She tells him absolutely everything. Come Monday morning, Emma thinks everything is A-OK until the owner of the corporation she works for shows up and is none other than the man from her flight, the one who knows all of her secrets.<br /><br />I adore Kinsella's work and this is definitely her best! Her writing style is witty, fun and fresh. Kinsella is a major player in the chick lit genre and I recommend that everyone give her a try (if you like chick lit). You will absolutely adore Emma and the jams she gets into!
B00080ZG1A|4.0|I didn't know a whole lot about Howard Hughes until I heard about the movie. SO I did some research about him online and then rented the movie. It was really good. I LOVED Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow.<br />I also recommend \\"Howard Hughes - The Real Aviator\\" in addition to this movie. That way you will know the whole story. :)
B00005JNEI|1.0|I heard nothing but good things about this documentary fron democrats and republicans. I myslef am a republican and I must say this... <br />This documentary is just propaganda. Moore wants you to reject the ideas, of our leader, President Bush. If you want to make a documentary, make one that shows the good descisions. Liberal media is all NEGATIVE sides, making Bush seem like a bad guy. The last terrorist attack was on 9/11, after that it was his first priority to protect America, he has succeded. There hasn't been a terrorist attack on American soil since then. But Moore makes it look like we haven't done anything about it. Saying he's taking too many vacations. Second of all the War in Iraq, I support it. It's the War on TERRORISM, not the war on Afghanistan. We have proof that Hussein used WMD's, he's killed a million of his own people with vaious poisons. Yes, poison does count as a WMD. We also went into Iraq because they disobeyed the agreements reached after Operation Desert Storm. We asked Hussein to disarm, he said \\"No,\\" ok, so what does that tell you? Moore also went around to members of congress to sign their sons and daughters up for the armed forces. Wait a minute, its solely the individuals choice to join, not their parents. Moore you are wrong there. What I don't understand is that we are fighting a War and we won't support the presidents descisions? I've also heard people say that America is the world's police, no we aren't, NO ONE ELSE WILL STEP UP BUT US. Moore exploits only a small portion of Iraqis that think that America has no business there. When actually, more people support it than don't. Moore, you are wrong again. Democrats need to stop listening to the media and start realizing facts. Moore's propagansa documentary was a boring and innacurate piece, done to turn you against your president. That's what terrorism wants you to do. So stop all of the negativity and lets thing positevely.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|Probably the best album I've heard in years.  James Blunt just took me away with his unique voice and beautiful lyrics.  Each song has a soul and story of it's own, but my personal favourite must be the exquisite 'Goodbye My Lover' which almost makes me burst into tears every time I hear it.  A great first album, and I recommend it highly.
B000008H1Y|4.0|\\"Songs From The Wood\\" marks a certain period of Jethro Tull, when the band turned away from rock and started getting more folk music influences in their sound. No, it's not pure folk in any way. Ian Anderson himself said, it was more like enjoying the sound of a folk instrument, a wooden instrument, and trying to freely write music with these instruments. But it's not exactly rock music either. It's a very good mixture of both contradicting styles. Similarly to \\"Aqualung\\", which was a constant interplay between heavier electric rock sound, and a softer acoustic music, SFTW is musically diversed. With a rocking celebratory \\"Ring Out, Solstice Bell\\", and \\"Cup Of Wonder\\" on one end, and quiet folksy acoustics of \\"Velvet Green\\", \\"The Whistler\\", and a stunning melodism of \\"Pibroch\\" on the other, Jethro Tull present us a good variety of track structures and musical themes. <br /> <br />Lyrically, this is Ian Anderson's declaration of how we can reach happiness only through leaving the false values of civilization behind us, and returning back to the embrace of Mother Nature, the way that our ancestors lived. There's much Celtic influence both in the lyrics and the music. As usual, Anderson's lyrics are multilayered, and full of hidden references and interpretations. A real treat to those who appreciate their songs with a meaning. <br /> <br />This album starts the folksy period of Jethro Tull that would continue on the 2 succeeding albums, \\"Heavy Horses\\", and \\"Stormwatch\\". Personally, I find it a little sub-par to the greatness of \\"Aqualung\\", or \\"Thick As A Brick\\". But the truth is that this is entirely another musical concept, and Tull deliver the goods here with just as much strength as they did in their golden days (1971-1972).
B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman Begins is the first truly great, instant classic film of the summer.  Forget the cartoony fiascos that were Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.  Christopher Nolan's sweeping tale of one man's quest to bring justice to a dying, corrupt city is deadlocked with Sin City as 2005's best movie.  Odd how two motion pictures inspired by the work of Frank Miller are so far the most memorable and entertaining films to hit theaters this year.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that the main focus in Batman Begins isn't gaudy set design, extravagant costumes, or a deep rooted desire to imitate; the number one priority is story.  Taking almost, if not all of, the humanizing elements of the Batman character and infusing it with an astounding balance of realism and comic book action, moviegoers the world over are in for something of a rarity, a superhero movie not dumbed down for the supposedly simple masses.  That a big budget summer blockbuster not only delivers on the action front but comes equipped with such a well written script has to be something of a studio fluke.  Hopefully a new trend in filmmaking has emerged, the smart action film.<br /><br />Don't worry for all you folks just looking for slam-bang intensity, this Batman ain't no codpiece wearing wuss. From Bruce Wayne's martial arts training to the jaw dropping capabilities of the Batmobile, the onscreen fisticuffs and pyrotechincs are enough to necessitate a drool cup for any hardcore action junkie.<br /><br />Batman Begins also delivers a sucker punch in the casting department.  Christian Bale gives us the most believable and downright scary Batman to date.  Michael Caine is eerily convincing as Alfred.  Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow proves his mettle and gives rise to an overall feeling of unease regarding psychiatric professionals everywhere.  Liam Neeson, although seemingly typecast in the mentor role of Henri Ducard, as always makes you believe he knows what he's talking about.  Morgan Freeman, well, he could recite Suess and it would be awesome; his Lucius Fox is way more believable (and a hell of a lot less annoying) than James Bond's Q. Katie Holmes as determined young District Attorney Rachel Dawes puts an exponential Grand Canyon gap between her and the teenybopper Dawson's Creek role that made her famous.  Tom Wilkinson as gangster Carmine Falcone proves once again that he's one of the best actors out there (don't believe me go rent In the Bedroom).  Now everyone mentioned above gives at worst an admirable turn, and this ensemble cast is a director's fantasy come true.  But there's one performance that's so surprisingly, unexpectedly good, I'd say it deserves the Best Supporting Actor Oscar right now.<br /><br />Gary Oldman as the up and coming Gotham City police officer Jim Gordon gives the performance of his already stellar career.  In a departure from his previous psychos and deviants Oldman plays his honest cop to unerring perfection.  We feel his conflict and his discomfort as he continues on the straight and narrow in a city filled with venomous curves.  He's Batman's number one fan and also his number one ally.  Oldman plays the workingman hero, the average Joe, the family man who keeps his head down to keep his loved ones safe; he not only nails it he redefines the archetype.<br /><br />Batman Begins is the must see movie of the summer.  I'm hoping word of mouth on this cinematic masterpiece will bring it well deserved box office success.  Extremely rich storytelling along with phenomenal character development should keep folks coming back.  I'm doubtful there will be a better movie released this year, at least one involving superheroes.<br /><br />Parents please take note, almost the entire film revolves around the concept of fear and accordingly there are some frightening elements and intense images.  Batman Begins definitely earns its PG-13 rating, so if your little tykes have a nightmare tendency you might want to check this out first before you bring them along.before you bring them along.

B0007KTBIU|3.0|I've watched many Disney feature length cartoons over time and this one is one of the most sedate ones I have ever seen. This might actually be good if your children tend to get wired watching some of the company's more antic characters and sidekicks. But, for me, it was lacking in that punchy charm I've come to expect with Disney characters. <br /> <br />One feature of every Disney story is that the main characters get sidekicks who act as comic relief. They tend to be eccentric people or intelligent and comedic animals. The ship's captain has a gaggle of interesting and crusty sailors by his side. The bad guy has a very quirky and cute little dog. But poor little Pocahontas gets one comical mammal and a hummingbird. The hummingbird just does not work as a comic sidekick. Its too tiny to have facial expressions and really is a one note joke. The other people in her group are toothachingly beautiful and heroic and lacking in any humor. <br /> <br />This is really sad. If you want to educate non-Indians about Indians, you really miss the point without the sense of humor. It isn't politically incorrect to have an irritable Iroquoi or a cheeky Cherokee or a silly Seneca. Really. Its OK. I think the movie was poorer for the gravity of the tribespeople.  <br /> <br />Another thing that got me was that they had to use a willow tree as a female advisor to Pocohontas. Why not an elder woman? With a sense of humor? I think of the wonderful old women in \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" and \\"Spirited Away\\". <br /> <br />That said, the quality of the DVD is outstanding. The songs are lovely, and the animation itself very watchable.
B000003TBP|5.0|Beck's debut, Mellow Gold, was a glorious sampler of different musical styles, careening from lo-fi hip-hop to folk, moving back through garage rock and arty noise. It was an impressive album, but the parts didn't necessarily stick together. The two albums that followed within months of Mellow Gold -- Stereopathetic Soul Manure and One Foot in the Grave -- were specialist releases that disproved the idea that Beck was simply a one-hit wonder.     But Odelay, the much-delayed proper follow-up to Mellow Gold, proves the depth and scope of his talents. Odelay fuses the disparate strands of Beck's music -- folk, country, hip-hop, rock & roll, blues, jazz, easy listening, rap, pop -- into one dense sonic collage. Songs frequently morph from one genre to another, seemingly unrelated genre -- bursts of noise give way to country songs with hip-hop beats, easy listening melodies transform into a weird fusion of pop, jazz, and cinematic strings; it's genre-defying music that refuses to see boundaries.     All of the songs on Odelay are rooted in simple forms -- whether it's blues (\\"Devil's Haircut\\"), country (\\"Lord Only Knows,\\" \\"Sissyneck\\"), soul (\\"Hotwax\\"), folk (\\"Ramshackle\\"), or rap (\\"High 5 (Rock the Catskills),\\" \\"Where It's At\\") -- but they twist the conventions of the genre. \\"Where It's At\\" is peppered with soul, jazz, funk, and rap references, while \\"Novacane\\" slams from indie rock to funk and back to white noise. With the aid of the Dust Brothers, Beck has created a dense, endlessly intriguing album overflowing with ideas. Furthermore, it's an album that completely ignores the static, nihilistic trends of the American alternative/independent underground, creating a fluid, creative, and startlingly original work.
B00011RPB0|1.0|The critics gave two thumbs up, and  the box descreibes as hilarious, but I think plot would have been helpful. Oh well, the background shots of Tokyo are interesting, and almost make up for the nihilism, but a travelogue would have worked just as well. The young actress Johannsen is certainly easy on the eyes. Overall, definitely a long, extended rock video with near zero content.  Bill was better on Saturday night live.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Frances the Mute is the latest album released by The Mars Volta. Aficionados of any of their previous songs or albums from bands like Cursive or At The Drive-In may really enjoy the unique presentation put forth by this CD. It is certainly one of a kind and both unprecedented and unparalleled. However, if you are new to TMV you should be sure to keep an open mind. To some, portions of this CD may just seem like noise and quite frankly, just weird. But the thing is, when you buy a Mars Volta CD you aren't buying 14 songs, nor are you buying it just for one or two songs like many pop albums. The whole thing behind the Mars Volta is that they are about as anti-pop as a band can get. When you listen to this CD you will realized you are listening to a 90+ minute story, not just 5 tracks.  <br /> <br />   Frances the Mute is an album with a harder edge and really more \\"out there\\" than De-Loused was. It is a symposium of all the different styles of music mastered by TMV, swirled together in a seemingly psychedelic rage. Oh; and there're plenty of Spanish lyrics and made-up words thrown in to boot. Now for a quick synopsis of the CD... <br /> <br />   Cygnus masterfully and stylishly moves in and out of various musical planes to create a very flavorful musical experience. Periods of musical insanity punctuated by unreal guitar riffs and vocal ingenious are the mode for not only this song but also Cassandra Gemini, an epic-of-a-song that ties the final product together very well. <br /> <br />Cygnus is followed by the most... criticized song on the album, The Widow. A lot of people feel that this is a newer, Televators-like song which was written for mass appeal. However I would say that if you haven't heard TMV this would be a great song to break the ice. Even though I have been a fan for a while, I like this song just as much as the others. The phenomenal voice of Cedric Bixlar-Zavala are highlighted by Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's guitar riffs throughout this short song. Myonly problem with this song is the long period of distorted sound that follows it, it's a bit long and drawn out but I guess that's what fast-forward is for...  <br /> <br />   My two favorite songs on this album are the last two that I haven't covered. L'Via L'Viaquez is the loudest and perhaps most poignant song on the whole CD. Its explosive and Cedric's vocals in both English and Spanish are truly stunning. In Miranda, the song following L'Via, Cedric's voice is again showcased behind the musical whirl that TMV creates throughout the Album. As I mentioned earlier, this song leads into the finale: the 30+ minute overture that is Cassandra Gemini. At the end, the song ominously reverts to the opening portion of Cygnus, (Sarcophagi) that completes the cycle of organized musical madness. <br />    <br />   TMV is the epitome of independent rock; swirling in Jazz, Electronica, Metal and just about every other genre of music to create a unique musical flavor. TMV strives for and is truly musical, not haphazard or noisy as some people may indicate. I was skeptical at first when I heard their music but after really listening and allowing it to sink in, I was awestruck. I implore anyone who loves music to give TMV a shot and pick up a copy of Frances the Mute. If you keep an open mind and give it time, you will surely find the group as downright amazing as I do.  <br />
B00009RDGA|5.0|This review is for the 2003 widescreen DVD release by Paramount.     A wonderful film in many respects and gets my highest rating.  The story doesn't lose any steam during the entire film and there are lots of great performances including the one by Tatum O'Neil who won an Oscar for her supporting role.      The plot is about a con man, Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neil), who sells personally engraved Bibles at inflated prices to the survivors of recently deceased spouses.  He preys on the emotions of the spouses to buy the Bibles, convincing them with lies that their dead spouses had order these Bibles for them.  Along the way, Moses attends a funeral where a mother has died leaving behind a young girl named Addie Loggins (Tatum O'Neil).  People attending the funeral notice that Moses slightly resembles the young girl and they ask him to help Addie find her way to her next of kin.  From that point on the Addie is convinced that they belong together, and the relationship works great magic through the rest of the movie.  Madeline Kahn also helps make this a very entertaining movie.    The attention to detail of the period with the music, costumes and props make it a feast for the eyes and ears.  It was also filmed in black & white and for being set in the Depression Era, it works quite well.  My only critical comment is that there was some profane language and a few adult situations which would disqualify it for family viewing which is a shame, because otherwise an entire family could really enjoy it.  One nice DVD bonus is by Peter Bogdanovich who gives about 30 minutes of commentary regarding the preparation and filming of the movie.      Movie: A     DVD Quality: A
0515123447|5.0|Reminiscent of Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest, which by the way is another great read, but with sufficient differences to avoid the classification of literary pastiche. Very entertaining and the Reacher character is certainly more accessible and sympathetic than Hammett's Continental Op. On the down side, the protagonist and his cohorts are well written and adequately fleshed out, but the villains are strictly two-dimensional. Nevertheless, a fine first effort! I look forward to reading more of Mr. Childs' work!
B00003CWMI|5.0|As great movies become harder and harder to come by, I feel this film will be one of the last great stand-outs.  It does a great job of showing what effects the passage of time has on one's inner being.  It's a touching story, but it doesn't really have a sci-fi feel at all.  It's more of a drama than anything else.  I think this film was marketed to the wrong audience.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman was quite literally on his deathbed after the mess that was Batman and Robin. It was a nail in the coffin that super hero movies had been building themselves during the 90s.  <br /> <br />X-men really started a new craze in Hollywood by being a super hero movie that was actually enjoyable. Spiderman continued the new fad. Yes, there are still failures in the super hero movie world, The Hulk, Punisher, etc. But, this latest venture into comic book reality is amazing. Batman Begins is Premium Super Hero Movie Making! <br /> <br />Not since Tim Burton had the helm in the first Batman has a Batman movie been this good. Better yet, this movie might actually be better than Burton's vision. Christian Bale might never be better than Keaton as Batman, but for the time being Bale is the best we have. And truthfully there could not be a better choice for the Dark Knight.  <br /> <br />There are small instances of comic humor in this movie, but for once, reality prevails in a comic book movie. This movie looks and feels great. The effects are state of the art, the bat-gadgets are actually believable and have a hint of science behind them, and the action isn't totally ridiculous (i.e. the Mighty Morphin \\"Batman and Robin\\") <br /> <br />This movie deserves five stars for reinvigorating a dying movie franchise. It is a great time and will please many a movie goer.
B00005M989|5.0|Prince is just a darn good musical artist.  Including a whole slew of his top songs on one CD is going to be a high quality product no matter what.  I personally would have liked \\"Pop Life\\" included, but other than that, I can't complain.  I would have gotten this even if it only had \\"Raspberry Beret\\" and \\"U Got The Look.\\"
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears has, in my opinion proved herself a competent singer.  Her songs are mostly fun and I love to sing along and dance to them! <br />Me Agains The Music: 9/10 I love this song!  The beat is fun and dancing to this is a major workout!  Madonna and Britney really amazed me with this song, which convinced me to buy the album. <br /> <br />(I Got That) Boom Boom: 10/10  One of my personal favorites! Having the Ying Yang Twins appear on the album with the hip hop was a really good idea!  It is so fun to dance to and Britney's voice sounds REALLY good on this song.  I wish she had released it. <br /> <br />Showdown: 8/10  I liked this song.  The beat was so fun and the lyrics were interesting.  Good song, but the meaning behind it was one of Britney's raciest so far on the album. <br /> <br />Breathe on Me: 9/10  This song was so dirty and fun.  The lyrics have really bad meanings behind them, but they are so fun to listen to.  My favorite part is when she moans into the microphone about how monagomy is.  Good song. <br /> <br />Early Morning: 7/10  This was a good song.  Her voice is interesting and the melody behind it is awesome.  The producer worked hard to make this song good and Britney really did that. <br /> <br />Toxic 10/10 Awesome song.  Another of my favorites!  Britney's voice sounds so good here and violins are just so funky and fresh.  I think that was the first time I ever hears violins used like that.  She really put a lot into that song and it turned out just amazing.  The lyrics are funny. <br /> <br />Outrageous: 10/10  AWESOME! Britney and Snoop Dog (Or whoever else rapped behind her) was really good.  I love the chorus when she tells us how outrageuos she is.  Funny song, but amazing vocals and danceable beat. <br /> <br />Touch of my Hand: 9/10 This song is most definately Britney's MOST racy and dirty as it is about self indulgence, but I really liked the song.  It reminds me of some Asian beat.  It was a gutsy song for her to do, and Ithink it was a good song. <br /> <br />The Hook Up:  8/10 Really funky beat.  Britney's vocals were really good.  <br /> <br />Shadow: 10/10 This is another of my favorite songs.  It took a while for it to grow on me, but then, it just blew me away.  He vocals are strong here, stronger than in Everytime, her only other real ballad.  There is so much soul in this song and some people say this song is so different from everything else, but I think it would have been a big hit if she released it. <br /> <br />Brave New Girl: 8/10 Britney kind of raps to this really fast-paced and random beat.  It is a good song, but not her best. <br /> <br />Everytime: 10/10 I was really pleased with this song.  It was one of the first songs of the album I really listened to and since then, I have really adored it.  Her vocals are impressive, but just a little breathy.  So emotional.  It was a big hit of hers. <br /> <br />Me Against the Music Remix: 9/10 This song is amazing.  The beat is so fun and just danceable.  Britey and Madonna totally sound good on this album.   <br /> <br />Thia album just never gets old to me!  It is a personal favorite of mine.  I think she did a really good job with the album. <br /> <br />Over: 119/130 or 92%!  I really would suggest this album!  It is just really cool and fun!  I cannot wait for new material by Britney.
B0006L16N8|1.0|what is it with this band?  the new U2?  puh-leez!  U2 wrote about something, tackled issues.  this coldplay mediocrity is nothing but falsetto-driven navel gazing and self importance.  if I come across an album with dumber lyrics in the next year I will eat my hat.  they have duped millions, and this album is the pinacle of their space-age plinking and silliness.  ugh.
B00005T7I1|5.0|I have been a fan of this movie since it came out in 1990. I saw it in the theater, bought it on video tape and finally on DVD. <br />Imagine my surprise when I read Mr. Beatty was putting together a director's cut of this movie for a propose \\"Vista Series\\" release. <br />I read on various sites, including \\"Ain't It Cool,\\" that 20-30 minutes would be added and the overall tone of the picture would be darker. <br />This was a couple of years ago and I haven't seen anything new on it. <br />I understand Mr. Beatty and Disney have gotten into some legal issues regarding who has rights over the film. I just hope they are resolved quickly and Mr. Beatty can get the Director's Cut out. <br />I love the first cut of the movie, but felt at times they were holding back on certain themes in order to bring in as many people as possible to make the picture profitable. If you look at the original comic, it was violent. <br />I loved Beatty as the honest cop, Madonna as the dame and Al Pacino as the ganster Big Boy. I also loved the fact they shot it in the basic color scheme of the comic. <br />The great things we are discovering with the DVD format is that now both the studios and the directors can have their cake and eat it too. <br />Studios can put out films at a length that can maximize ticket sales and directors can present their films as they intended on DVD for the people who want to see it. <br />I am really looking forward to the day we can see the director's cut of this film. <br />Disney and Mr. Beatty - DON'T KEEP US WAITING TOO MUCH LONGER!!!!!!!!!
0345457684|3.0|If this is what you're looking for, you're going to find it in full force in this book.  This book is very violent.  While some reviewers feel that the violence was unnecessary, I think it achieved the effect the author was looking for.  It lends the book an overall dark mood.  The sex scenes were detailed graphically, reminding me of some hard-boiled romance novel.  The drugs this future world concocts are many and varied.  Some let you experience death, incite violence, increase your sex drive, and just get you high.  <br /> <br />The plot relies heavily on the concept of sleeving, which is an interesting sci-fi concept. The book does examine several of the more interesting and scary consequences of this new technology, such as repeated virtual torture and Meths, people who are centuries old due to continual resleeving.  I found the many small details of the plot confusing to keep track of.  There are many minor characters, and if you put the book down for too long you may forget their relevance. <br /> <br />Overall, I thought this book was okay.  The author has definite room for improvement.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Hollywood-style action movies, but if you're looking for a more thoughtful sci-fi story, skip this and read some Gibson.
037571457X|5.0|It is difficult not to become enamored with Marjane Satrapi's story of growing up as a small child in Tehran amidst the chaos of the '79 revolution. In her surprisingly simple, imaginative, and touching mini-autobiography, we see the world through the eyes of a young, wide-eyed Iranian girl who struggles to maintain her childhood innocence and independent mind in the face of the Iran-Iraq war as well as draconian government policies inspired by Islamic fundamentalists.    In addition to providing a first-person account of a left-leaning intellectual family's life in Iran in the years following the overthrow of the Shah, \\"Persepolis\\" illustrates the problematical nature of revolutions and wars in developing countries, where one oppressive government is often traded for an even more oppressive government, and where citizens must tragically live in a constant state of danger.    I was left pleasantly surprised by this beautifully composed work, and must admit that I underestimated its depth. As a quick read that can be finished in one sitting, it is well worth it.
B00005JNTX|1.0|I saw this film in the theater and hated it. It came off like a teenage boy trying hard to write a Tarantino script. Everything the two bumbling henchmen said struck me like the guy who wrote it was writing it just so people would have something to quote from the movie.<br /><br />The multiple dismemberment or castration scenes were just pointless and ridiculous. When someone has their genitals pulled off and it bores you, you know there's something wrong. It seemed like the point was to be shocking and cutting edge, but like I said, they missed the mark here and I was really just tired of it by the time the ninja prostitute showed up.<br /><br />I will say that I really liked the cinematography. The look of the movie was great, and that was the part (going into it) that I thought I'd like the least, but it ended up working very well. I would have rather seen them only use color at certain times or for highlighting important things to the audience, instead of just randomly giving a guy red shoes, but I guess that's ok<br /><br />I thought the camera angles, the way the shots were framed, all that was needlessly repetative (6 or 7 shots with a thonged woman's butt in the left foreground, and the person talking in the right background, for instance), but no more so than the actual script, so maybe that's not something anyone else cares about
0312323859|3.0|Having absolutely LOVED \\"Something Borrowed\\", I was elated when I found out Giffin had another book out, \\"Something Blue\\", written from Darcy Rhone's perspective. While the first half of this book is quite funny -- maybe even funnier than the first book -- the second half felt rushed and SO VERY CLICHE! It was as if I could feel Giffin's agent calling, pressuring her to finish by deadline. The story becomes very predictable by that point and when everything finally comes together, I was almost nauseas by the convenient tidy endings for all the characters. I do not think Giffin gave this book her all as she did the first one.  <br /> <br />Hopefully, Giffin's agent will let her take her time on her third book! I am looking forward to it!
B0009HLDFU|4.0|When Dave Grohl went out to form the Foo Fighters back in the mid-nineties, he laid a trail to escape the washed-upped sounds of the Seattle grunge revolution. At first, it paid off. Grohl quickly ignited his own identity and started to form a band collected with members he hand picked to help escort him. Then, with a rock and roll makeover that maybe only Courtney Love could afford; Grohl decided to follow suit. Gone, went the long hair that he once hid his face behind. Out, went the drumsticks that made him legendary, and in came the electric guitar that would make him his own front man.     Just call Grohl and his Foo Fighters the new millennium version of Paul McCartney and Wings. Without all of the baggage of the backstage drama. But let's make no mistake, Grohl is far from his Nirvana past. Hell, many young Foo fans probably didn't even know he played the drums in the first place. -Boy, do I feel old writing this.- Perhaps, maybe, Grohl has finally found a little peaceful place of nirvana of his own in recent years. With a couple of hit albums, along with some hit singles to his credit, what is left for this once grunge rocker to do?     I guess it doesn't hurt to put out another record. Grohl and his alumni's have cranked out a new 2 disk set collection entitled, In Your Honor. If your looking for Grohl to pay homage to the late Nirvana front man, Kurt Cobain, maybe this is the record that does it. Lyrically, it almost seems as if Grohl is speaking directly to him. Musically though, Grohl sounds more like James Hetfield then his former companion. In fact, this two disk record set release is exactly that. Two totally different albums. There is the heavy rock on disk 1, while, disk 2 explores the softer side of the sympathy.    Oddly enough, there isn't a catchy pop song on this whole record. It almost seemed as if Grohl has made a decent living creating those catchy riffs that we all seem to sing along with and get stuck in our heads. There are some standout tracks on this record at least. The track, Resolve, still deliverers the harmony and rhythms that fans have come to aspect from the band. The quietly mundane track, Virginia Moon, captures the folksiness of the lyrics behind the shredded guitars. I enjoyed the somewhat Beach Boy-esque, What If I Do? It's been a great experiment to allow themselves to try something new with this record. I like that.    In Your Honor, strives to be more reserved from all of the other Foo Fighters albums. Although it may alienate some, it still leads you guessing as to what else Dave Grohl has left in his pocket of surprises. Rock On.
B00005JNJT|4.0|After 16 years of bad Batman movies, BATMAN BEGINS is a quite a refreshing flick. It is exciting and intense and boasts terrific characterization and themes. Arguably the best thing about the movie is simply the style with which it is approached. The movie examines the character of Batman and sort of asks the question: What would it take to be Batman? The film is visually impressive as well, including some very nice scenery and interesting contrast. The action is also exciting, but it emphasizes adrenaline and movement over what actually happens (my dad complained heavily about that).  <br />       The biggest disappointment of the movie is not so much a problem as a shortcoming. At the beginning of the movie, as we begin to examine the character of Batman, we are given some interesting observations and conversations about fear. Batman has to face his fears, etc., etc. Therefore, it just makes sense that the Scarecrow would be among the villians Batman must face.Unfortunately, the writers did not make use of this wrinkle that could have been very well executed. After we find out about the Scarecrow, there is no further use of fear as a theme when we could have had Batman having to face his fears and confront the Scarecrow, proving himself a worthy crime-fighter.  <br />        Despite this shortcoming, the movie is extremely entertaining and is easily the best Batman movie yet. I hope for more in the style of this one.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Like others have said, this music needs time to grow on you. Regardless, I don't think that this is quite up to the standards of its predecessors. Coldplay has become a little too sure of themselves. There are many other new albums coming out right now by other bands that I'd much rather spend my 15 bucks on.
076790592X|5.0|\\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" was an amazing book. We read the book as a class At Portsmouth High, English 10. The book was read a loud to a class full of 15-17 year olds and I think that made the book that much better. The book is a great book for those who have ever lost a loved one or are going thru an experiance of losing a loved one. The book brought a tear to my eyes by the end. The book now holds a special spot in my heart because it's really true to life, that sounds dumb because its based on truth but its and very moving book. This book is great for all ages, probably better for those above 10, 10 if they are a very good reader, and has a good understanding of the feeling that come with loosing sone lone you love. This book is amazing dont miss you on it.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|In a recent recent interview Grohl noted that the band's last album contained a bunch of filler, which was why the songs were practically dropped from the set list while on tour. I like Grohl, his sense of humor and his music. But this album is so $%&#!@* boring, so predictable, that I believe Dave's pleasure these days involves turning out garbage, only to laugh his twizzler off while hapless fans buy it all up.  <br />Please, Dave, bring back the minor chords. Bring back songs like \\"Exhausted\\" and stop wasting our time. I'd rather listen to your eight track farts than this tripe.
B000002H38|5.0|While I was growing up, my mom constantly played music by Stephanie Mills, Patti LaBelle, Mikki Howard, Stevie Wonder,  Donny Hathaway, Sade,and Earth Wind & Fire. Now that I'm older, my music collection is quite similiar to my mom's. In fact, she's always asking me if she could borrow my CDs. Back in the day my mom had Anita Baker's \\"Rapture\\" and now I have that in my CD collection too. Words can't describe how exquisite and pleasing this album is to my ears. All of these songs are classics and each time I hear them it feels like I'm hearing them for the first time. What I love about Anita Baker is that she has never changed her style and has stayed true. You know, there's a lot of dumb artists out there, like Mariah Carey, who want to waffle between genres- depending on what's popular at the moment- and they sound phony. Not Anita Baker. Her current music is just as classic as it was back in the day.
B00097DX3U|2.0|Soundgarden was my favorite band of all time and i loved Rage. i thought SG was about to become the biggest band on the planet after DOTU when they split at the height of their success - total integrity. CC is the best singer out there and his solo album was a solid and creative new direction. that he should have stuck with.     everything about this band is mediocre and diluted - thats the only review needed. the name just means nothing and has no spark, just like the music, just like the graphics and imagery, just like the lyrics and themes.  their wells have run dry and success is just too good to put down - because this is, for the most part, automatic music tailored to automatic audiences that gets automatic sales.     one of the major problems, like another has pointed out, is Morello. they are trying to be a classic rock band, which i have no problem with, but he uses his old guitar trickbag from Rage. the solos truly do get annoying (like much of the lyrics). its cut and paste gtr effect from Rage to this audioslave song.    former genius and freshness is now pale self-imitation.    finally, they just do not have the inspiration to write good songs, or complete good songs. they have a handful, and a handful of good parts. i like the new, mellow directions of Heaven's Dead, Yesterday to Tomorrow, the esp. killer verse of #1 Zero, Getaway Car, directions CC can go in himself and do as well or better.  after two bands known for innovation and unique creativity, the supergroup of average mean has formed.  that just happens to have the goldest voice in rock, the tightest rhythm section and the most interesting guitarist. all writing and creating averagely. these guys were popular music geniuses and certainly still could be - esp. singerguy rockgod. they are still so talented that even if they write crap songs, its still better than 95% of whats popular. but i see these guys just diluting legend. when a killer verse like on track 3 crashes into the unbelievably trite corn of that chorus, well its time to rest and live life and spend your millions and wait for the well to fill back up.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I take issue with those who are grumpy about Universal's decision to re-release \\"Jaws\\".  It must be pointed out that having a new edition of a DVD released five years ago doesn't automatically mandate a purchase.  If a prospective customer chooses to hang on to that previous DVD incarnation and pass on this new one, so be it.  As new technology is invented, there will be other, future editions, I assure you.    This new \\"Special Edition\\" sounds better than the former release on DVD.  The Academy Award winning sound has more bite than before, cleaner and more gripping. most noticable in the separation of voices from left to right.  Gunshots and explosions are more deafening now, and play better in surround mode.  The whale calls in one quiet scene have more distance in 5.1, although they are barely audible on TV alone.    I agree that a feature commentary would have made this issue more \\"sellable\\", and there certainly was plenty of room to add trailors, premiere footage, interviews on the \\"Today Show\\" and whatnot.  But what we have here isn't bad.    This new disc set includes the complete 2-hour documentary \\"The Making of Jaws\\", which was also on the former DVD, but whittled down to one hour.  To be honest, the one-hour version actually gives us everything we need to know, and is edited with great care.    For anyone who has not purchased \\"Jaws\\" in the past, this would be a great place to start.
0783225725|4.0|Located on the coast of southern California in the days of the Western Territory, the town of Lago stood idly by when their marshall, Jim Duncan, was brutally whipped to death before their eyes. The three scoundrals that did it are soon to be released from territorial prison and revenge is certain to be on their minds. The town hires the quick gun and ruthless gaze of Clint Eastwood, stranger with no name, to protect them.<br /><br />\\"Revenge is a dish best served cold\\". And that's what we get in High Plains Drifter. Clint plays the ruthless, cold-hearted killer with a quick draw and a sharp eye for pretty women. He intends to serve up a dose of justice, Clint Eastwood style, to this weak-kneed community lacking backbone and a conscience. And, whie he's at it, deliver a little something to the scoundrels who killed Jim Duncan. What transpires draws the viewer into the showdown with all the high drama of Eastwood's better-known westerns.<br /><br />The movie is very entertaining and certainly makes its point. You gotta love Clint in this old western role.
B0008G2IRO|4.0|I've yet to listen to the entire album, but based on the songs that I have heard and their previous work, I'm sure this album will deliver. The first single, Feel Good Inc, is an amazingly catchy and unique song. &quot;Don't stop get it, get it..&quot;. Anyhoo, I recommend it, but, in all honesty, once more, I haven't heard the ENTIRE album (I've heard a good portion though). I was impressed, but that's my opinion.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I recently started watching this series and when I say recently I mean 3 weeks ago I have already completed all 3 seasons available and I am hooked and waiting for the fourth to come out.  This series is for all people men women and children just cause its says Gilmore Girls doesn't rule the boys out they put a halarious yet realistic outlook on love,life, and everything in between.  I strongely suggest to everyone to see this, you won't regret it.
B00005KHJM|2.0|Much has been made of the portrayal of Christians in this movie due to the character of the police officer.  He's got the stereotype down pat as he has repressed and prudish attitudes towards sex and he is angrily intolerant of any religious beliefs and practices that are not his own. <br /> <br />Yet little has been made of the portrayal of pagans in this movie which is equally negative given the film's conclusion.  Just imagine if bigots like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson ever got a hold of this movie.  The ending would confirm a major fallacy they and those of their ilk would like to perpetuate against modern day pagans.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I saw the TV special and just had to get the DVD as soon as it came out.  It captured the awsome music this group and the individuals from this group have made hits.  Not only can you see the Eagles \\"loitering\\" on stage, but you hear them at their very best.  One of the interview's in the extras I believe Don Henley said that as all of them have aged, their music has gotten better.  He wasn't lying.  Watching the DVD I witnessed first hand how much they enjoy playing for the audience all the old stuff and some of the new stuff.  It reflects in their voices and in their songs.  A great way to merge the greatest hits from the past as a group, with the new inviduals solos as the band members went out on their own and brought back to the group.  If I could just play this DVD over and over again, I would never get tired of the classic music of this classic band!!  They will live on.... well after their farewell tour!
1878424319|5.0|I think everyone looking to improve their lives, starting with themselves, should start with this book. It is very simplistic and practical. It get's you thinking about what has happened in your life and your reaction to it. Instead of blaming others for what has happened it gives you the ability to be compassionate which, I believe, is key to changing for the good of all.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I do not consider myself as a big fan of The Eagles. I only know a few hit songs and the name Don Henley as a reference. But, I own a bunch of live DVDs and I have been to a lot of concerts. I can tell you this is one of the MOST AMAZING LIVE PERFORMANCE EVER.  <br /> <br />For the price, this is really a great package ! Here's why : <br /> <br />- You will most of the best songs performed PERFECTLY, as on the original recording, by these great musicians and singers. The vocal harmonies are the best I ever heard live. Every note sounds right and sound quality gives DVD technology the respect it deserves.  <br /> <br />- Bonus ! You get songs from solo careers, like the inconditional \\"Boys of summer\\" by Don Henley. <br /> <br />- The concert is long and spectacular, there are great featurettes and the price is very low compared to good concerts like this. <br /> <br />You can't lose your money with this. I'm not a real fan and I love it, so if it is your fetish band, you will be in Heaven with this purchase.
B000002LFU|4.0|this is a really good album. This album sticks out from other R.E.M. albums because it's kind of the edge of still \\"old\\" R.E.M.(1980-1988) and the new wave R.E.M. (1988-2003). and that makes really different R.E.M. there are really good songs on this album my favorites. <br />1. Pop song 89 5/5 catchy and real funny. <br />2.STAND 5/5 catchy and otherwise no comments <br />3.Get up 5/5 great song <br />4.Orange crush 5/5 no comments <br />5.Turn you inside out 5/5 good song.
0312323859|5.0|I read this book in less than one day. I just could not put it down and stayed up untill one in the morning just to finish even though I had to wake up at six to go to work. This book was great because it didn't just change Darcy to make her the heroine. She really went through some life changes and realized what was wrong with the way she was living. And unlike some reviewers I loved the way Ms. Giffin tied things up in the end. I always want to know what happens to everyone. All in all if you enjoyed something borrowed then you will love something blue. Happy Reading!!
B0000029DD|5.0|I am sad to say that I first heard of Jeff Buckley while watching an episode of 120 minutes where Alanis Morissette of all people was picking the videos for the hour. When she came up on Jeff's video for \\"Last Goodbye\\" she couldn't even form a sentence properly, Instead, she just stuttering and fumbled around until she finally just put her hand on her heart and said \\"Listen to this.\\" I listened and my jaw hit the floor. There is something amazing about a person with a voice like his, someone who looks the way Jeff did, the way he could play guitar, and seem so self-conscious in the moment. I'm the first person to bash singer-songwriters, but there is something earnest, an honesty, a sense of being completey humble to his gift and to his words, that just struck me. It still strikes me today. And that voice! Oh, that voice of his! His guitar, his words, his melody! When I asked for the CD at a record company I was working for at the time, the guy who gave me the CD was shocked, confused, and said \\"Great choice.\\" I remember making the long drive from Los Angeles and was on the verge of tears. Tears turning to smiles, to hope, to exuberance. playing tracks over and over again at dusk. Jeff's music was a gift from God. It still is. The best way I can sum up how much I love this record, how much it has meant to me, how it's easily in the my top 2 favorite records of all time is this: I've only been in love once, and I've only given Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\" as gift once, to that same person. Enough said.
0316096199|2.0|I found Alice's story interesting but her presentation sorely lacking.  There was almost a misanthropic feel to the entire text, as though she always hated people, men especially, and being brutally raped was the perfect excuse to case her hatred of the human race in a book and sell it.  I felt sorry for what she endured, and I applaud her courage and bravery in recovering from that traumatic event.  I didn't care to hear about her entire childhood and bizarre relationship with her parents.  I just felt that she wandered endlessly, and didn't stay focused on the story that was truly hers.  Sadly, this is not one of the better memoirs about rape/sexual assault.  There just isn't enough substantial material in the author's life to fill 250 odd pages.
B00005LC4B|5.0|Martin Scorsese directs this masterpiece with the best music by far that I have ever heard. De Niro stars as Max Caddy, a man accused of rape who spends 14 years in prison. When out, he decides that he wants to take out revenge on his lawyer (Nick Nolte) and his family (Jessica Lainge and Juliette Lewis) because he thinks that it is his lawyer's fault that he spent so long in prison. Caddy is a beast with so many tatoos that one detective says : \\"I don't know whether to read him or to look at him.\\" His tatoos are very neat and it makes him look even more brutal. During the course of this movie, I hated him at times and then asked myself if maybe he didn't do this rape. You start to wonder, that maybe he was turned into a beast alone in prison where he tells his lawyer that he was sodomized. De Niro deserved an oscar nomination for his amazing performance even though he would have lost to Anthony Hopkins. Nolte must face Caddy but must also face his marriage as it is falling apart. You don't really even like Nolte's character either as he has cheated on his wife and tries to bribe Caddy with money. The story was suspensful, but also tragic to me as I wondered if Caddy was wrongfully accused. The movie has one very thrilling scene towards the end which I won't give away and after the movie, I was very pleased with this fantastic film. The movie shows a tale of revenge, in which the bad guy is really evil at one scene but then you pitty him at the next.
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers stand out to me as one of the best new bands around with this \\"turn it up\\" debut.  The opening tracks will have you jamming without even realizing it.  The infectious \\"Mr. Brightside\\" isn't quite as good to me now that it's getting so much radio play, but the song is definitely worthy of the airtime.  Every song is a good one--this CD has been a part of my regular rotation since I bought it 2 months ago.  My only complaint is that the album mellows out as it progresses and the later tracks aren't quite as \\"rock and roll\\", though definitely still good.  Absolutely worth buying--I can't wait for the next one!
0767830555|3.0|I was very dissapointed by this Martin Scorsese film. It had the good actors, the good plot, but seemed just weird. Without all of the necessary pieces, it ends out being an average movie. De Niro plays a cabbie who drives nonstop becomes he can't sleep as he is haunted by memories of Vietnam. He then falls for a woman played by Cybil Sheppard as well as later falls for a prostitute played by a young Jodie Foster.  <br />De Niro's character is driven to madness and buys guns so that he can save Foster from her kidnappers. He gets a mohawk and has some classic lines like \\"you talking to me?\\". But, ultimately, I was bored by this movie that just seemed to go nowhere. I was lost at some moments and didn't even really realize that he was trying to save Foster at the end. I knew it because he had given her money for her to flee but the scene comes out of nowhere and is very brutal, bloody and unnecessary. This movie felt like a waste of my time and I was very dissapointed.  <br />On the other hand, everyone else seems to love this movie. I guess I just don't understand this because the movie felt boring to me and just unnecessary.  <br />But, I'm sure that no one will listen to me as I'm different than all of the other reviews and I'm the guy that fell asleep during two viewing of Alien. ( It wasn't nightime) <br />The night I watched tis, I chose it over Se7en and I regret this as I watched Se7en a couple days later and absolutley loved it.
B00005JNJT|3.0|I'm extremely partial to Batman Returns and Batman: The Animated Series (As well as a bit of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker) and in my mind nothing gets better than that. It's those kinds of showings that really mark what Batman is to me. I just figured I'd put that out there before I got into Batman Begins.<br /><br />First off, the cast was well chosen but... the villains weren't really how I thought they should have been. I loved the supernatural feel through Batman: T.A.S. and this was... well... a bit too much like a real life sort of thing. The car was also a little disappointing and in a way... just made it one of the things that made me want to say \\"This isn't Batman, it's a character in a suit saying he's Batman\\". OK, onto things I liked. Gary Oldman. He did a good job of playing Gordon because he was someone you could tell wanted to do his job right. That's what Gordon is supposed to be about. One of the few good cops in a corrupt city. Next... the batcave. I really do prefer the new cave over the last ones. It's a lot more realistic and more... well... cave. There shouldn't be more technology than cave in my opinion, regardless of how much cash you have. Also to put it out there... *SPOILER, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET* I had a dream that I was Bruce Wayne and I burned my house down and rebuilt it. I had that dream before I knew anything about the movie. So... it's weird that it happened in the movie. Really weird.
0060523794|5.0|Folks familiar with the theory of Black Holes might know that once a Star outgrows a certain mass, it has a tendency to collapse under its own gravity and become a black hole. This is the kind of state where IBM was in 1993. IBM had outgrown under its own success and was about to dis-integrate and collapse and thereby leave a huge black hole in the world of Information Technology. This book is all about how Lou V Gerstner single handedly saved IBM from its near collapse.    In this book, Lou Gerstner has done an nice job of providing rare insights into the issues(and their causes) that were ailing IBM in pre-1993 era. And how he systematically & methodically addressed those during his nine years at IBM from 1993(when he became CEO of IBM) to 2002 (when he retired from IBM).    Lou Gerstner's narration about his first day as IBM CEO who was left knocking on the doors of IBM is telling of the IBM culture at that time. In 1993, when Lou Gerstner took IBM's reins, IBM had become a collection of small, small fiefdoms where every head of the Business Unit was selfishly guarding his own interest and dreaming of becoming a CEO by going IPO someday. IBM mainframe business was failing. The world seemed to be moving towards Client Server architecture. Instead of being customer focused,  IBM was becoming internally focused. IBM stock was plummeting. Stock holders were getting impatient. All in all, there was chaos within the company.    Against this background and against the common wisdom/expectations, Lou Gerstner sticked to his guns and decided on keeping IBM together. He meticulously regrouped IBM by providing one single leadership at the top. Magically reversed the core IBM mainframe business by cutting prices and becoming customer focused. Synergized the IBM messaging division by providing single message to all the world. Intelligently put his bet on Services, Software and eBusiness. Realigned the employee incentive system to encourage the culture that promotes customer oriented actions. All of which paid off tremendously. If Stock Market is any barometer, the IBM stock rose from sub $10 to $140 under the leadership of Lou V Gerstner.    This all may seem trivial but considering the disappearance of big companies like AT&T, the turnaround of company with IBM's size and stature just seems amazing!     This book is really, really good. If at all, the only complaint I have is that it does not talk about any of Lou's failures. The book not only provides good business lessons, it also provides good personal lessons. Specially Lou's passion for winning is infectious.    Overall an excellent, excellent read ...    -Sachin

B000088E6D|3.0|The truth be told; Michael Bubl&eacute; has a great voice, its a shame all the songs on the album don't suit it.<br /><br />I can understand why all those who have fallen in love with his music did, it is cleverly disguised as a masterpiece (David Fosters' handy work) but the truth of the matter remains that when you do cover versions, you set yourself up for comparisons as well as criticisms. When performing someone elses' songs you need to reposes that song make it yours; he did that with Moondance & Kissing A Fool but not the rest.<br /><br />Three ill-performed songs in a row was all that I can take, he single handedly managed to murder Queens' \\"Crazy Little thing called Love\\" & then went on to massacre his mentors' \\"Put Your Head On My Shoulder\\" & Dean Martins' \\"Sway\\".<br /><br />The other songs on this album are listenable at the most. He got 3 out of 5 for voice, character & maybe performance however lacks color & emotion.<br /><br />As kids we were told \\"Sing What You Mean, Mean What You Sing\\" & Michael does exactly the opposite.<br /><br />The bright side is that he is still quite young & has a lifetime to learn & better himself. Not to mention being surrounded by some of the biggest names in the industry.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|Is there anyone left in Hollywood that isn't on drugs, has one married affair after another, or have any morals left like Paris Hilton that can make a movie?  I'm beginning to think with all the earthquakes in California maybe the best thing is to have a huge one where the entire State of California will just fall into the ocean.  Then and maybe then will someone of talent make movies that are enjoyable to everyone.  Right now there is no more talent in Hollywood, nither actors, producers or directors.  This film made me feel embarrased that the rest of the world sees what little talent we have in america.
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie is absolutely riveting and thrilling. It is sad, as well as freaky at times and is almost as good as the Silence of the Lambs. It isn't a shoot em up thriller as it develops slowly with detectives Sommerset and Mills, played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt who inspect murders, all realting to the seven deadly sins. The movie is very original and has a great performance by Kevin Spacey as the killer, John Doe.  <br />It does have lots of disturbing images as well as a pretty freaky plot but is reccomended for anyone who likes good thrillers. This is a scary movie because it could be real, while all of the movies in the horror section like Freddy or Jason are just stupid because it isn't realistic and the killers are invincible. I hope everyone realizes this and doesn't go to see the millions of even worse sequels. <br />On the other hand, Seven is scary and is a masterpiece. This movie has all of the pieces it needs to succeed, from a good cast, to a good plot, to a well executed film, it succeeds in every possible domain. Reccomended to everyone who isn't faint of heart.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Dull supernatural thriller than has Keanu Reeves playing a modern day ghost buster who helps a police detective (Rachel Weisz) in a race against time to prevent the end of the world. Now this is an interesting premise but the biggest problem this film faces in the casting of Keanu Reeves, who is miscast to the hill. It also does not help that his performance is as wooden as ever in this film, not to mention the fact that his character is more of a selfish jerk than a person that you can root for and not to mention the fact that he is also the most underwritten character in the entire movie.  You don't really care about him at all and you really don't want to spend any more time with him as well. His leading lady Rachel Weisz steals the movie from right under him and the rest of the so-so cast with a tight and strait forward performance that is soulful and gripping but the movie unfortunately is not as deep as her performance and it tilters between juvenile and self parody. The screenplay at one point of the film does an about face and contradicts all that was explain earlier in order for certain thing to just happen for the sake of the climax, which is not very good to begin with. <br /> <br />If you want to see it, you will not be disappointed with the great performance of Rachel Weisz and of Peter Stomare, who is criminally under used in a great cameo but you will be disappointed with the movie as a whole.  <br />
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Whenever prolific singer/songwriter Ryan Adams releases a new collection of songs, his fans never know what to expect to have emanated from his schizophrenic personality. With his latest release, \\"Cold Roses,\\" backed by his band The Cardinals, they will find 2 discs chock full of robust southern rock that get increasingly enjoyable with each successive play. Making like his contemporary Conor Oberst, who released both \\"I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning\\" and \\"Digital Ash In a Digital Urn\\" this past January, Adams has two further LP releases penciled in for release by this year's end.<br /><br /> The 18 track collection starts off with the laid-back piety of \\"Magnolia Mountain\\" and then coasts into the glorious \\"Sweet Illusions,\\" which tastefully steals some chords from the Beatles' classic \\"And I Love Her\\" before taking flight in other directions. Other more raucous selections like \\"Dance All Night\\" and \\"Beautiful Sorta,\\" are filled with addictive electric guitar licks and catchy choruses.<br /><br /> The light-hearted \\"Easy Plateau,\\" which finds Adams looking for \\"some place to rest my head,\\" features of the most humorous lyrics on the album:<br /><br />\\"Sleepyhead, come on let's take a ride/To the easy plateau in the back of your mind/Up through the alley, take the door under the stairs/My head ain't feeling nothing but cats and rocking chairs.\\"<br /><br />  Despite its serious lyrics, the frolicking\\" If I Am a Stranger\\" recalls John Mellencamp's at his most effervescent. In addition, straight-up folk of \\"Rosebuds\\" and the bittersweet title track feature up and coming musician Rachel Yamagata on both vocals and piano. The set's easy highlight, however, is \\"How Do You Keep Love Alive,\\" with its urgent melody, sullen performance and pleading lyrics.<br /><br />  \\"What does it mean?/What does it mean to be so sad?/When someone you love/Someone you love is supposed to make you happy/What do you do/How do you keep love alive?\\"<br /><br />  All things considered, Ryan Adams has yet again put together a fine record that proves his consistently excellent knack for songcraft has not at all been diluted with time or heavy output. In a music industry where mindless pop clogs our charts, a musician such as himself is a breath of fresh air. That he will build momentum and popularity over time is inevitable.things considered, Ryan Adams has yet again put together a fine record that proves his consistently excellent knack for songcraft has not at all been diluted with time or heavy output.

1400032717|5.0|I entered this book not knowing what to expect. The event driving this novel is the death of a dog? And I don't even like dogs! There is much more in store, however. Haddon's portrayal of Chris as a first-person narrator feels right to me. His reports on how he can get overloaded by too many people or two many stimuli rings true. His literal interpretation of rules and his precise totally logical approach to the world gives a unique perspective to the family events (which I shall not reveal) that surprise him and the reader.<br /><br />Chris proves to be courageous in facing his fears and challenging himself to find the killer and find out about those he cares for, in his own enigmatic way, the most. If you've been hedging on this one, you'll find it moves quickly but surprises and gives you an insightful look into a boy and his world.<br /><br />Last thing is that the form of the novel really held my interest. Lots of math for those who are interested in that kind of thing including a proof in the appendix! Great type of book to try and connect mathematics with a way of looking at the world. Sure, Chris is an extreme of that view, but his natural aptitude for mathematics can show others how mathematicians think. There's a great joke, his only joke [after he promises not to tell jokes but then says his lie is not a lie but a *clarification*] about an economist, a logician, and a mathematician that I found laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />There's lots of good stuff here. Try it, you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />four and a half stars. Let's hope there's a sequel!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Being around DT since 1991, and in fact having a private almost \\"garage band\\" recording of James Labrie's first sessions with this band \\"live\\"...I feel so close to this group of men it is as comparable as my love for YES. <br /> But I NEVER dreamed the band would make it this far in a world saturated with pathetic-pop-rap driven garbage. But then DT doesn't need to be accepted by the masses...as they have their own masses- a group of very intelligent sophisticated and spoiled FANS that are seemingly endlessly saturated by the band's unselfish nature (and Mr. Portnoy's obsessions)! <br /> I ran the album through after waiting 2 weeks deliberately to see reviews. I typically have done this since \\"Falling Into Infinity\\", because over time...and different listenings...the listening value changes. In this case I was stunned to see some rather negative reviews about the \\"softer\\" sound after such negative reviews for the grungy studio-run-through \\"Train of Thought with it's fierce metal edge! <br /> Dream Theater is uncanny as a band and very intelligent, of course driven by the nadness of Portnoy/Petrucci. I snuck up on DT this time. I played the massive title track FIRST. Imagine my surprise when track 1 started the way \\"Octavarium\\" ended. The sound of Jordan on one key, and some electronic subtle noise. I realized then that by accident, I discovered this album is quite literally one massive conceptual piece. The placing of tracks only enhanced my feeling, as the band put \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" in the second slot. I encourage buyers to program their CD players to play \\"Octavarium\\" starting with the title track and program the remaining sequence to follow. An almost eerie cohesion appears upon doing this. <br /> Of course one could say \\"the beginning of 'the Root of all Evil' was truly announcing the album, and Jordan announced the end with the end notes in the title track.\\" I found it FAR more pleasurable of an experience to switch the sequence. <br /> The productionand mastering by the amazing \\"DOUG!\\" makes the album level and almost perfect in it's mix. In contrast to ToT, in which some spots exploded out into one's ears, this album is levelled and adjusted so that the band is so cohesive, the only thing that really through me was the section with John Myung nearly reprising a bass-line from Yes' \\"Heart of the Sunrise.\\" The album is not surprising to me in that it's better than \\"Falling into Infinity\\", but otherwise because of it's content- cannot really be compared to anything the band has done! That is the reason why the album is incredible. Keeping their integrity, with heart and soul- Dream Theater does it again. Only \\"Images and Words\\" moved me more with the exception of the suite proper of the 40-minute \\"Six Degrees.\\" <br /> Magically gifted, the album is reminiscent of Yes and ELP and everything that DT does better. I love every song. I find no error in this project, and hats off to John and Mike for toning down the instruments respectively to let the band- and Orchestra in and of itself- shine through. God bless Dream Theater and their vision!
B000002C1W|5.0|This was the first Pink Floyd album I ever had.  I was an ignorant 13 year old who thought rap music was the only music worth listening to.  I didn't know about Waters or Gilmour, at the time the \\"Momentary\\" Floyd was the same as the \\"Piper\\" Floyd to me.  This album is what introduced me to the wonderful Floyd library and classic rock in general.  It took me years to really put the quality of their music in perspective, but I finally acknowedged the genius that was Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />If your young and generally love music, this is a good album to start with for Floyd.  Its not something you'll put in your car, at first, but you will.  Floyd was an amazing group, even without Waters at this point.  I recommend this to anyone, but specifically anyone who is under 18.  Don't just listen to it once, give it a chance young musical apprentice.
B00005JNJT|5.0|After leaving the theather, I was one happy guy. Batman was always the coolest and most interesting comic book character to me but all of the big screen adaptations all failed in my opinion. While the first two were above average, they still were not at all like the good comics. The next two were absolutely horrid and now this one is absolutely fantastic. The acting is superb with an exceptional performance by Christian Bale as Batman. He IS the best batman. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson are superb as usual while Katie Holmes does a nice job. Cilian Murphy is perfect as Scarecrow and the mask he uses is great. The movie is good because it first introduces Batman and his training with Liam Neeson. The lines pronounced by Liam Neeson are fantastic and it shows Batman's great fear of bats. He thus must learn to conquor his fear and return to Gotham where he can fight crime. I loved the new Hummer like Batmobile and when Bale was Batman, it was perfect. The words pronounced, the anger, and the appearance of the awesome costume had me and probably the rest of the world in true glory. If you don't like Batman, you should still watch it as it is one of the year's best films. If you don't know anything about Batman, this movie explains his roots. If you are a true Batman fan, it will be by far one of your favorite movies. If you think that the movie is going to be for children, it's much more dark than the others. This is the Batamn that I've been waiting for and it isn't just good, it's one of the best movies that I've seen.
B000002KDO|4.0|\\"Master Of Reality\\" is a small step below the possibly best-metal-album-ever \\"Paranoid\\", but it still rocks hard. \m/<br /><br />The guitar riffs are catchy, but they're even sludgier and heavier before (if that's even possible), and the lyrics cut just as deep as they do on the previous album, especially on \\"After Forever\\" (it's nice to see a good ol' blast of Jesus Power in a genre that is often stereotyped as 'Satanic'). Other huge hightlights are \\"Sweet Leaf\\", which has one of the most frantic, frenzied middle-sections I've ever heard (complete with lightning guitar solos and drumming) and the closing ballad \\"Solitude\\" uses only an acoustic guitar and flute, but is immensely beautiful and immensely melancholy.<br /><br />My problems with the album come with the 2 interludes: \\"Embryo\\" and \\"Orchid\\". Sure, the first one is funny, and the second one is pretty, but they also seem really pointless to me. Because of them, there are only 6 actual songs here, which would have been okay if they were longer (like on their first album) but most of them are around 5 minutes long. There are also no 7 and 8 minute epics like \\"War Pigs\\" or \\"Hand Of Doom\\" which kinda sucks, considering that's one of the things Black Sabbath does best. Still, this is a great representation of how heavy metal got rocking.
B0000028VT|5.0|This 1993 album \\"Music Box\\" is Mariah's greatest selling album of her career as of writing this review. Although many remember it with the happy-go-lucky title track which holds a lot of great memories for me as well as \\"Hero\\", this album overall emphasizes more on ballads especially in the latter half of the album.<br /><br /> Overall though, this is a great third outing from Ms. Carey and was yet another home run out of the park. The cracks do sometimes show in some places but this is a rather consistent album and for Carey fans, this is a highly recommended CD to get. A pity that she eventually started travelling down a very rough road after this and \\"Daydream\\".
B000068IEU|2.0|Those that were around when this first came out should remember that there was somewhat of a stir about this movie in some cicles. Basically it's reputation  preceded it and many of us were horrified at the thought of the movie without actually ever seeing it. The trouble is, is that once you did see it, it was a  major let down, mainly because it is really poorly shot and most of the script is totally unbelievable(the parents revenge portion anyway).   The flipside is that we did'nt come to watch a movie with a good scipt and top notch acting--we came as depraved curiosity seekers and some of what we saw was truly disturbing.  Was it as disturbing as we had envisioned---no.  Did it live up to it's reputation--no.  It's really a toss up I would guess. I think it served a purpose in 72' but now it seems like a student film and I guess to some degree it was.
B000006O7C|4.0|4 stars that's what I give this album. I gave GRACE 5 stars. So it's worse than GRACE, right? Not really. You see, it's the album that Buckley never wanted to release. He recorded a bunch of songs,   <br />but he wanted to try it again, he wasnt happy with the result. He never got that chance. He died. Anyway, his family and record company didn't want to leave us with only GRACE, so they put the \\"Sketches for\\" in front of the already planned title \\"My sweetheart , the drunk\\". Slammed the recorded songs on it together with a bonus cd with home recordings and demos, and released it. <br />There you have my reason for not giving it 5 stars. If Jeff had lived he surely would have released something better. <br />BUT I do think that the gross of disc 1 is ALREADY better than Grace. We get to hear a diffrent Jeff. A more experimental Jeff, a more ALTERNATIVE jeff. I think after GRACE he thought that album was to polished, too sweet. He wanted to make something more raw. \\"Sky is a landfill\\", \\"Yard full of blonde girls\\", \\"Nightmares by the Sea\\" are examples of a more raw Jeff Buckley, they are great songs that have that great 90s alternative rock feel. \\"Everybody here wants you\\" Is Jeff trying to do R&B, also great - great song. <br />Too bad we never got to hear more.... Too bad I never found anybody close to Jeff. Rest in peace.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie is an absolute blast! I haven't read any of the graphic novels but this movie has made me want to. Beware, as it isn't for the faint of heart, as it contains strong violence but great humor like in Kill Bill. The movie is divided into 3 parts. The first one is concluded at the end. I don't want to give anything away but Bruce Willis plays a cop with a heart problem hunting a pedophile; Mickey Rourke is a BEAST ( he's huge) framed for murder; Clive Owen hunts down crooked cops and tries to save prostitutes from extermination. It's a must see and is original as it is in balck and white with color only appearing at certain moments. Reccomended for anyone that wants to watch a movie that's just absolutely AWESOME!
0743454537|3.0|Here's a great example of a book that tries too hard to accomplish too much.  I've never read this author before, but I stumbled across MY SISTER'S KEEPER at the bookstore, and the description sounded interesting, so I made my purchase.  I mean, what a compelling idea.  One sister (Kate) is diagnosed at a very young age with a rare form of leukemia (it's always rare in books).  In order to obtain some cells & marrow she needs to have a hope of recovery, her parents create a genetic match of a sister (test-tube baby) and Anna is born to be a living donor for her older sister.  When Anna reaches the age of 13 or so, and a kidney of hers is needed, she files suit to have medical emancipation from her parents so that they can't force her to give up her kidney.  She's tired of having no identity beyond that of donor...no one seems to care for her beyond what she can give her beloved sister. <br /> <br />This is a meaty moral, ethical and dramatic subject.  Right there, you've got enough for a good book.  The legal wranglings and the emotional turmoil struck me as having great potential.  Couple this with the always heartbreaking subject of parents' dealing with the impending death of a child, and we should be well on our way to a good read. <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult is a writer with a talent for summoning up metaphors, similes and for picking up on little details of everyday life to explicate her bigger themes.  There is some real pain in this book.  It's told in the first person, but from various character's points of view.  Anna, Kate, Sara (the mother) Brian (the firefighter father) and so forth.  Some of the best moments are when Sara remembers the early days of Kate's illness.  We also get some good insights from Kate and Brian.   <br /> <br />But this 200 page book is turned into a 400 page paper-weight by the burden of too many more characters and plot threads.  We meet Jesse, the older brother of Kate and Anna.  Okay, you say, the point-of-view of another sibling, not bred as a donor, might be worthwhile.  But Jesse, through being ignored by his parents because they're so focused on Kate, has become a disreputable, drug-addicted pyromaniac.  It isn't good enough that he have some problems, he has to be an addict (a condition we only know about because it's mentioned...we never get a sense of what this means to Jesse internally) who sets fires (his dad is a firefighter...get it...pretty FRAUGHT, isn't it).  We also meet Anna's attorney Campbell (that's okay in and of itself) and we are forced to meet Julia, the court appointed guardian ad litem (assigned to determine if Anna is qualified to decide her medical treatment for herself) who happens to be a former lover of the attorney.  We see scenes of their past, and their rekindling present, and it's all clich ridden and dreadful.  We could have done ENTIRELY without the romantic subplot.  And the attorney also has a \\"service dog\\" named Judge who goes with him everywhere, but Campbell won't tell anyone what \\"service\\" the dog provides.  It's a little mystery, that when solved, is such a night-time soap opera revelation that I had to roll my eyes.  Oh, and by the way, the parents decide not to hire  a lawyer to defend their position, because Sara IS a lawyer (just a non-practicing one) and she decides to take on the case herself.  Ick. <br /> <br />The book grapples effectively with grief.  It handles the money issues that come with great illness well, and it conveys how TIRED everyone is of the battle.  But it also is full of extraneous junk.  And finally, my BIGGEST gripe is that the voice of Anna is that of a 30 year old.  She's the most brilliant 13 year old ever, with the ability to write huge, sweeping passages of emotional depth that few adults could dream to obtain.  We NEVER get the feeling that she's a child.  We're TOLD she's a child, but she sure doesn't sound like one.  Really, the voice of each of the characters sounds pretty much the same.  Too much like the author is having each person represent a position on the issues...they aren't always flesh and blood like we need. <br /> <br />The book  also takes some \\"surprise\\" twists at the end, with revelations and events happening very quickly and shockingly over the last three dozen pages or so.  But to be honest, once again it all felt like a soap opera, and a particularly overwrought one at that. <br /> <br />There are elements to admire in the book.  Picoult has skills.  But this book missed its mark pretty widely, and I can't recommend it. <br />
B0006SSOHC|2.0|Two men wake up in a scuzzy and awful looking bathroom with chains and ankle bracelets on them attached to pipes. They dont know why they are there until they find 2 tapes and a recorder on a dead guy in the middle of the room. So, there's a sadistic loony killer called The Jigsaw Killer out there who loves to play games with his victims and has them play in dangerous scenarios involving barbwire, bear traps and fire. Soon. Doctor Gordon, played by Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride, Robin Hood Men In Tights) and the other man Adam, played by Leigh Whannell find out why they are there....they find 2 saws and to get out they cant saw threw the chains, but their legs to get loose. Some very creative moments with the suspense a very creepy looking clownlike doll on a toy bike and the surprise ending is the only thing that keep this at bay. The acting in here is subpar with Danny Glover (The Lethal Weapon Movies, Bopha!) wasted as a cop on the case, Monica Potter (Along Came A Spider, Head Over Heels) as Elwes' wife and Cary Elwes is so-so though he kinda gets ridiculous at the end where he saws threw his leg. Not for the squeamish and it's really dumb to see some scenes where they go into fast motion (example...car chase scene). Also starring Tobin Bell (THe Pelican Brief), Benito Martinez (TV'S The Shield) and Ken Leung (Rush Hour, AI:Artificial Intelligence).
0670033375|5.0|After throughly enjoying Diamond's previous book \\"Guns, Germs & Steel\\" I initially found this book harder to get started on.  To anyone who has a similar experience, I would strongly encourage them to stick with it. The manner in which Diamond is able to logically pull together historical information with current experiences is truly gifted.  He can support ideas and theories as well as anyone I've ever had the pleasure to read. The section on the Norse settlement in Greenland and his ability to remain non-judgmental stand out as two aspects of the book which made it especially useful to me. <br />I would LOVE to have taken a class from this man.  <br />Excellent book and once you get over the first part and into the \\"meat\\" it is a much better read than I was first inclined to believe. Stick with it, it is well worth the effort and there is plenty of relevant information for us in the present-day to consider in how we live.
6305131090|5.0|Okay, this film does appear very strange at times, as it shows Austrian composer Gustav Mahler smashing a Star of David, taking a sword to symbolically kill a dragon (the old traditional German masters), and eating pork washed down with a mug of milk to show his renunciation of his Jewish roots, just to get ahead on the music scene. <br /> <br />If you can't stand an anachronistic Cosima Wagner goose-stepping back and forth to determine if Mahler is worthy to conduct in Vienna, then you should'nt watch this film. <br /> <br />But you'll be missing something valuable.  Ken Russell captures Mahler the genius, who was both arrogant, and yet uncertain. <br /> <br />Many of Mahler's most beautiful themes are used throughout the film and always at appropriate places.  It was in this way that the film captures Mahler's genius for taking what he hears in the natural world and tranforming it into his symphonies.  Especially poignant was an English version of a song from Kindertotenlieder, which accompanies a nightmarish fleeing of Mahler's daughters through the forest during a storm. <br /> <br />A portion of a symphony which includes the sound of a rattle, is led into by Alma trying to quiet the Mahler children, shaking a rattle. Likewise one of the frightening \\"what the animals of the night tell me\\" phantom monsters of the Third Symphony, appears to young Gustav as a white horse terrifying him in as a very literal \\"night mare.\\"  <br /> <br />As one who believes Mahler was the greatest of the Romantic composers, and perhaps also a sort of musical philosopher or even theologian, I find more to enjoy in Ken Russell's Mahler each time I watch it.  It's a little bizarre at times, but also very beautiful.  <br /> <br />Two more quick comments:  Robert Powell, the actor who plays Mahler, looks astonishingly like the composer. <br />The \\"bad transfer\\" which other reviewers have remarked about, has obviously been corrected, as current copies are perfect.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Most of the reviews I've read of this album all praise this as being the best of Coldplay's three full length CDs. Ha. Now, dont get me wrong, Coldplay's third effort, entitled X&Y, is a great effort, and a great album, better than Rush of Blood, but not as good as Parachutes. The reason for this is that Coldplay seems to be straying towards making lovelorn, depressing ballads, as more than half of the songs on here definetly can attest. However, ballads, are not necessarily a bad thing, so it seems as though Coldplay's popularity will not dry out for at least another couple years. That being said, there are some truly terrible songs on here, songs which are either so bad, so cliched, or so depressing that you'll end up skipping them. There are as well some excellent songs on here, and all of them put together justify the 4 star rating. Below are are a rundown of all the songs on X&Y, and do yourself a favor, and read this review, then reun out and get the album will ya? <br /> <br />1. Square One: Soft verses and a thrashing chorus combine to make this one of the best songs on X&Y. However, it must be said that anyone who disliked Politik will probably not like this song, But then again, i didnt like Politik either. (10/10) <br /> <br />2.What If: It had to happen. Shortly after a great start with Square One, we are treated to easily the worst song on this album, slow, depressing, and just downright terrible, What If is not worth your time. (3/10) <br /> <br />3.White Shadows: One of the best songs on here. I love the guitar melody, but the bass is the true star here. Martin's vocals really shine during the chorus, and the ending. (10/10) <br /> <br />4.Fix You: Once again, a great song is sadly followed by a very mediocre ballad. It's very slow to develop, andwhen it does, it just goes on in this mind numbing drone. Very skippable. (5/10) <br /> <br />5.Talk: Another very good song. But the best part is the guitar which follows a very simple, though enjoyable melody, mainly let down by having some not-so-great lyrics. (8/10) <br /> <br />6.X&Y: A very slow to develop song, starts with Martin sining while playing the organ, some great lyrics compliment a decent melody. (7.5/10) <br /> <br />7.Speed of Sound: Clearly, this song tries very hard to imitate Clocks, with its lyrics, bridge, right down to the piano loop. Unfortunately, this song is a pale shadow of the song it tries to mimic. On its own, however, its a decent song with decent lyrics. (8/10) <br /> <br />8.A Message: Martin playing the acoustic guitar...an interesting concept, and one that works very well, given the soft lyrics and even softer tune. One of the better songs on the album. (9/10) <br /> <br />9.Low: This was my favorite song at first, but after a few listens it started to settle in the middle of the pack, some great verses, but a slightly underwhelming chorus add up to a pretty good song that could've been better. (8.5/10) <br /> <br />10.The Hardest Part: This song is pretty good...during the verses, but during the chorus, it seems as though they forgot how to write decent lyrics, but the rhythm is faced paced, which is always good. (7.5/10) <br /> <br />11.Swallowed in the Sea: Another slow, mournful, and boring song, and a song that never,EVER picks up steam so the song just kind of drones on, and on....and on. (4/10) <br /> <br />12.Twisted Logic: Another start with the organ but then develops into a very good song, with a chorus reminiscent of Radiohead's \\"Electioneering\\" a great song that leads into the finisher. (8/10) <br /> <br />13.Kingdom Come: The tribute to Mr. Cash, is very well put together, and stands as a great finisher the album, which was already very good to begin with. This song leaves you with a good feeling in your heart. (8.5/10) <br /> <br />So, in conclusion, you don't need to be a fan of Coldplay to enjoy this album, but if you are, all the better.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|The music on these two discs is great. The copy protection scheme they have on it really is awful. When I import the discs into ITunes they seem alright. About half way through a song it starts skipping and popping.  <br /> <br />Foo Fighters - get your act together. Drop labels to restrict customer rights.
0679805273|5.0|I have had this book for quite a few years and finally decided to read it. I found that this book (often quoted in corporate america) was good but not the best book on strategy that I have ever read. I believe that his writings were very well done and provided some good insight as to how to strategize and understand your enemies. I believe that a solid person with good life experiences would understand many of these situations already. There was some valuable information though and I can see how this information was conveyed into corporate culture.<br /><br />Harold
B0009KQOCO|5.0|wow, I was looking around at all the movies coming out for the PSP and now I just want to go movie crazy.  This movie is soo cool and I hope they come out with the second movie.  I'd give this five stars because it has a great plot awesome story for an old movie and a character you'll learn to love and want to know what happens in his next movie.  My advice would be to pre-order this baby b/c it may go fast for people that love this movie.
B000002UTO|2.0|Ugh. What can I say about the infamous 'Big Thing'? To call it an underrated masterpiece would be equivalent to calling their debut album trash and reccomending AUDIOSLAVE, who are a COMPLETELY different band, instead. <br /> <br />This is Duran Duran going through their middle-aged crisis, or something like that. Simon has a horribly dreadful hairdo, and the band itself was moving towards the likes of hip-hop. <br /> <br />THE GOOD <br />___________________ <br /> <br />There are two good songs on this album, and that's not a lot. 'I Don't Want Your Love' and 'Too Late Marlene', but the latter was much better. 'I Don't Want Your Love', the album's first single, was a funky hip-hop song with Simon actually rapping. That one bit isn't the best, but the singing makes up for it. 'Too Late Marlene' is a hypnotic love song of some sort. Simon's voice shines on this song... <br /> <br />THE BAD <br />______________ <br />...and it's probably the only song he shines on. 'All She Wants Is' is a overrated song dealing with lust and greed. 'Do You Believe In Shame', the other single, is perhaps too boring. The rest of the songs , to put it simply, were bad. <br /> <br />OVERALL <br />______________ <br /> <br />PLEEEASE, do not pick this one up. If you are a true fan of Duran Duran, or a collector's fanatic, this one is still just a waste of money. Take my advice; although it kills me to say anything bad about DD.
B0009IW88A|1.0|The music is bad, the film es very bad. Warner is killer of Batman leyends. Puajj.
B00005JNJT|3.0|\\"Batman Returns\\" may satisfy aficionados, but it it won't create converts.  As a comic book adaptation, it is average.  Those who are not particularly enthusiastic about the genre will most likely just watch as the movie goes by, unwilling to be fully drawn in to the fantasy universe of Gotham City in \\"Batman Begins\\".   <br /> <br />The special effects are decent and the City looks real.  The acting, however, particularly on the part of Christian Bale, is near non-existent.  As for the training sequences, the story is bland, stale and sometimes unexplained.  The fight choreography fails to impress, as the editing is too heavy-handed.   <br /> <br />Unlike the rest of the Batman series the script of \\"Begins\\" tells the story of Batman as a boy.  The story of Boy Bruce Wayne is in line with the movie as a whole, as it is interesting in some some regards and unconvincing in many others.
B00005JNJT|4.0|Christian Bale, having bulked up 100 lbs. to 220 lbs. from his 120 lbs. virtual skeleton frame of The Machinist, puts on the most believable Batman rendition since Michael Keaton - hands down.  Unlike Clooney and Kilmer, he is just as credible as both Bruce Wayne and Batman - hardly a simple task.  And let's not forget Michael Caine as Alfred - how good was he?  And, last but not least, Katie Holmes wasn't exactly hard on the eyes and performed admirably as well.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|These songs all sound so similiar that it does not take long to get bored of this album.  The foo's are a great band, but I have yet to hear an album from them where there are more than 3 good songs.  The best song on this album is \\"the best of you\\", and that has a pretty redundant chorus.  I wanted to like this album because I was anticipating it, but it is a disappointment.
B00005176F|5.0|The 2nd British invasion, otherwise known as Britpop, climaxed during the release of the singles 'Roll With It' by Oasis and 'Country House'  by Blur. Both were noteworthy contenders for the #1 spot in the British charts. Each band was the antithesis of the other. Anticipation mounted and the tension between the two bands grew as they vied for the top position. The struggle wasn't merely about revenues, it was also symbolic - the witty social criticisms and pop sensibilities of Blur pitted against the snarl and rock 'n roll swagger of Oasis. Although 'Country House' outdid Oasis at first, the release of '(What's the Story) Morning Glory?' undid any success Blur had with their single up till then. However, ten years later, it has become quite obvious who the real winner was. <br /> <br />Now when I was young enough to experience the last gasps of Britpop I thought Blur was uncool, which was the sort of term with which music is judged at that age. Of course a few years later I saw the error of my ways and this is the first CD I purchased. My Blur collection is growing, albeit slowly, and this is certainly not a bad place to start. It's all here in the 18 songs: delicious pop hooks, the la-la-la's and the laugh-out-loud satirical lines. There's even a dig at Oasis here: 'Country House' contains a line referring to 'Morning Glory'. Some parts might be hard to understand for those who aren't British, however that shouldn't deter you. Apart from Song 2(obvioiusly) highlights include the aforementioned 'Coffee & TV', 'Girls & Boys'(disco romp that was used in the MTV show 'Dismissed'), 'This Is A Low', 'There's No Other Way' and of course the classic 'Parklife'. Yes, I guess that every hardcore Blur fan would have a list of songs that are supposedly more worthy of a place on a greatest hits album, but this song collection is in my opinion varied enough to give novices a good impression of the band. The last track, 'Music Is My Radar', also hints at what was to come on their latest record 'Think Tank'. The '90s was a decade of renewed innovation and rebellion after the dire '80s, a decade of mass consumerism, hedonism and globalism, but also of unbridled optimism, and this record is the voice of that generation.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This is truely the greatest album we've seen since John Coltrane released A Love Surpreme in 1965. Sure there were good ones, but this one will sure stand the test of time. <br /> <br />Metheny has always been different and every one of his albums was amazing and different, and just when you thought it couldn't get any better, any more thrilling, more amazing, out comes this brand new release; one song broken up into three parts with an introduction. This is genious! How they play the whole thing straight in concerts now is beyond me. The musicianship is amazing, and it's a different turn every second. I wonder how long it took these guys to get this down. <br /> <br />This is better than anything Mozart or Bach ever did, or at least in some major ways, and it's right up there with Coltrane's best, and Kind Of Blue. Just spectacular. Words cannot describe my feelings toward this disk. <br /> <br />How can you say Metheny is running out of ideas. This is incredible! This ain't just a bunch of cats swinging in 4/4, this is NEVER BEFORE heard stuff! A look to the future; a \\"way up!\\" Something that is in the moment, and that does not look back. <br /> <br />This album is the times! This album should go down in history with the classical composers. 68 minutes of pure joy! Last time anything was as fresh as this was, a very long time ago.  <br /> <br />Metheny is just a genious and anyone who can play with him and play on this wonderful suite is just genious. Metheny's cohorts, Lyle Mays and Steve Rodby, still with him. Oh, what a great group. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if Metheny can top this with his next release, and as much as I don't want him to retire, this would certainly be a GREAT album to go out on.  <br /> <br />Magnificent masterpiece! <br />Pat Metheny Group <br />The Way Up
B0009A40ES|5.0|American Psycho is a very untique movie,but it has style,its odd, it has a wonderful cast, and last but not least it takes us back to the 80's!!!!!!

If you like odd stuff then you should go rent this movie and check it out for yourself!!!!!

If you love horror movies then please go rent this movie better yet go ahead and buy the movie it is worth every penny and it would make a great dvd in your collection!!!!!!!
0385484518|1.0|Shallow and sappy.  You're better off reading a book of inspirational quotes.
0783226888|1.0|This movie pretty much sux. Go read the book instead and exercise your mind a little. <br /> <br />The one lesson I learned from this movie was from a lesser supporting character. She is the former girlfriend from Spain, of the Irish convict who leads the good guys to the bad guy. She eventually shoots the bad guy in the subway station. The lesson was this: <br /> <br />\\"Live a life of international crime while dating IRA hitmen, immigrate illegally to the USA where you deceive your husband and kids about your past until, in a moment of vigilanty vengeance, you shoot someone in a subway. For this you get tacit citizenship and a stellar waterfront house on the river outside DC. <br /> <br />Obviously this movie was made before Sept 11th, 2001. Oh how we've changed. <br /> <br />BakaTBakaSTakaT.Cz
B00097DX3U|2.0|I will probably still buy the next Audioslave CD, if there is one, in hopes that the third disc will match the hard hitting R&R of the first one.  That said, 'Out of Exile' was a disappointment.  While the first album was one of the best sets released in the last 20 years - the second was a pale imitation of 'pop' music.  What happened?
B000957O7S|5.0|Will Smith nailed the role for this movie and it was a cute feel good romantic comedy!!!!!! Will plays a love doctor by the name of Hitch and he makes love connections for those that don't have a special someone!!!!!! Well he then meets Sara which turns his life around!!!!! If you love romantic cute feel good movies then you really need to watch this movie and who knows maybe you should watch this movie with your love one!!!!! The movie has a great cast and the story is charming and i love that they filmed it in New York!!!!!!! I totally would buy or rent this movie tonight what can i say it has it all charm, romantic, and of course Will Smith!!!!!! ENJOY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!
0671004107|4.0|I read Contact after seeing the film, and without a doubt, the book is leaps and bounds better.  For one thing, the emphasis of the story is quite different.  Rather than concentrating quite so much on the main character's beliefs and love interests, as the film tended to do, the book instead delves fairly well into how contact with an alien civilization might play out on a sociological level.   <br /> <br />For that matter, Contact also shows a balanced an forthright view of the battle between science and religion, and how the two are not mutually exclusive.  On this point, it should also be noted that to interpret Sagan's writing in Contact as atheistic, as one reviewer here claims, is to have missed the point of a great deal of the book.  Sagan's views as demonstrated by Contact and the characters he conjures in it are decidedly theistic in tone.  Sagan makes it clear in several ways that the main character's strongest motive is a search for spirituality through scientific enlightenment.  Also balanced against the main character's atheistic opinions are the opinions of several well-rounded characters for whom the spiritual and the scientific are complimentary and mutually reinforcing ideals.  All in all, Sagan's treatment of the subject shows a high degree of sensitivity to the subtleties of spirituality, while also making it clear that extremists in any camp are dangerous and frequently irrational.  Sagan's strongest criticisms in the book are reserved for the thoughtless, insensitive, and fanatical regardless of what their basic belief systems are. <br /> <br />Also note that there are several major plot lines and characters found in the book that are wholly absent from the movie.  Readers of the book are lucky though, as this difference is to their benefit.  Sagan's characters are quite interesting and diverse, and the plot is much better, if a bit politically dated. <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading Contact immensely.  Those of a philosophical and analytical bent should get a kick out of the arguments between the characters and groups scattered throughout Contact. <br /> <br />However, I'm not particularly enthused about the ending.  I won't spoil it, but I will say that it's too obvious and strives too hard to reconcile science and spirituality. <br /> <br />Contact was certainly worth reading however, and I wish Sagan had lived long enough to write more fiction.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is one of the best albums ever created. Along with Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin IV. Maynard's lyrics are so unique as is his voice, while the rest of the band backs it up with creativity and great rythm. \\"Disposition\\" maybe one of my favorite songs musically, and \\"Lateralus\\" is my favorite song on the album. Lateralus is the best we've seen from Tool, although I'm hoping that when they release their album in the fall we will see greater things.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best albums in the last twenty years.
B00000JLEP|3.0|Himself a phenomenal pianist, Scriabin arrived to the same twelve-note scale harbour as his austrian contemporary  Schoenberg had but from an altogether different route, as he devised a \\"system\\" of \\"piling up\\" fourth-interval chords instead of going the Schoenberg way from melody itself. I'm not sure if the one was aware or not of the other's work but Schoenberg had followers that extended his work and methods whereas Scriabin had not. For the listener, Scriabin's works will sound far more \\"tonal\\" than the austrian's but if you study the scores closely you'll end up more or less in the same place although with the russian's apportation permeated with a strong emotional element that is generally absent from Schoenberg's techniques (but to which Berg would introduce most effectively a few decades later). <br /> <br />When I came across this CD I was puzzled, for I had the impression that Scriabin's language would prove as alien to Boulez as would be, say, Richard Strauss' (although I'd be quite interested in hearing what he could do with Salome or Elektra, especially with the latter), more so in the case of the early, chopinesque Piano Concerto. And in the end, my impressions were confirmed albeit with an unexpected twist. This is very well recorded and with top playing by Ugorski and the Chicago Orchestra, Scriabin, but in the end a low-voltage Scriabin. Boulez seems more interested in the two later works and sounds more convincing in the \\"Poem of Fire\\", than in the rest of the disc's programme, making this most intriguing of Scriabin's works sound even Webern-esque (and indeed one wonders where Scriabin would have arrived to had he lived longer). <br /> <br />For me Boulez is less effective in the piano-less \\"Poem of Ecstasy\\", with the Piano Concerto's results somewhere in between. The \\"Poem of Ecstasy\\" sounds uninvolved, distant and somewhat \\"hammered into\\" that really assimilated. The inner energy the composer welded into the score is rarely present and the powerful climax called for never really conforms to what is written down, an ecstasy that stalled midway so to speak. As I said, the concerto fares better and receives a handsome performance from Ugorski but in the end fails to convince wholly and makes you refer to other versions in your collection, better consubstantiated with its style and atmospehere. <br /> <br />A mixed bag, then, but an useful modern vehicle for three works from a composer that deserves far more diffusion.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Before listening to this album I logged to amazon.com to see what people thought about it. Indeed some reviews helped alot concerning that I would like it, others had practically made me feel not to be excited over this album. I recieved my dual disc by mail 3 days after it's released and I listened to it all the way.    Indeed there are no solid tracks in here. No 'Live Forever' or 'Supersonic' from Definitely Maybe, nor 'Wonderwall' or 'Don't Look Back in Anger' from Morning Glory. But the whole recopilation of tracks on this album is what makes it so great. Every track in this record is well placed one after the other, making it more enjoyable. The songs are great, yet alot of people diss it, why? Is it because Rock n Roll came to an end? This album is their least britpop in my opinion, and it was about time a band made a rock album like this one. Forget Oasis past albums, forget the past and forget what has already happened. This is now, and the new Oasis we're hearing. If you're still into their first two albums then just stick to those. Every band needs a change and Oasis has certainly done it, by all goods.    About their new songs, they sure do rock! 'Mucky Fingers' for sure it's one of the best songs of the year and prolly my top 5. 'Let There Be Love' is atlast placed on a record. I heard this song back in the 'Standing On The Shoulder of Giants' era when it used to be call 'Let There Be Love (It's a Crime)'. It has been edited for all good since this version is amazing! Another Oasis classic that sounds strongly for a single indeed. 'Keep The Dream Alive' is superb in all ways. I'm loving it! Those are for me the standing out ones, yet all the songs are great either way. Opinions may vary in their favorite tracks on this album.    Please note what this album is supposed to mean. 'Standing On The Shoulder of Giants' was dissed at first since fans couldn't get used to their new sounds, yet now they wished Oasis kept making records like that. Prolly 'Don't Believe The Truth' will be no exception aswell. It's one hell of a rock n roll album, and it's just what we needed nowadays.    Believe The Truth!
B00068NVI4|5.0|I saw YES during this tour and they are absolutely fantastic !! <br /> <br />The level of musical talent and experience on the stage was higher than I have ever seen in years of concert going.  <br /> <br />I have read from some Yesfans that they have the DVD in their hands and say that it is great. <br /> <br />For those incredible whiners, crying about the delay, we all are fortunate that these guys have to be the most prolific musicians of their times. Solo, together, with other musicians, the new SYN group. They have SOOOOO much material out for the fans.  <br /> <br />Anyone who has given this a low rating because they had to wait a little longer are so childish and are ignorant fans of no one.  <br /> <br />If you knew anything abouot the \\"business\\" of the music and DVD business you would understand that the delay is not about YES, but the business crap with the corporate idiots fighting over dollars and rights. <br /> <br />Please growup.
B0000257O9|5.0|I'll let others enthuse about the music in this album; enthusiasm I wholeheartedly endorse. Instead, I'll enthuse about the quality of its recording and sound engineering.    It's amazing how Trevor Horn creates complex mixes without turning them into mush. Check out the bass guitar in \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\", somehow sounding clean and muscular through the already dense sound. And the chunky, woody arpeggios played by Geoff Downes at the end of \\"Clean Clean\\". The power of the three-note riff in \\"Island\\". And other aural delights throughout the album too numerous to mention.    To hear what I hear, you have to play the CD through audio equipment that's strong on rythmic drive and is able to grip the lower frequencies. This is not an album for low powered valve amplifiers. But play it through something like Naim amplification, for example, and every time you hear the kick drum at the opening of \\"Video\\", you'll find yourself sitting up and paying attention.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|When I saw the above title on a copy of NME, I figured it was just NME being its usual hype-rag self. But then I bought the album. You know how advertizing is always trying to convince you that product x will make you happier, more attractive and successful? This album is probable the only thing I've ever bought that actually worked that way. Not that you should expect the same results, but my quality of life has improved dramatically since I purchased this CD over a year ago. I can't even begin to explain without writing a full-fledged essay. But seriously, if you're planning on wasting $15 on a self help book, buy this album instead.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I've always believed that the original Batman was the only one that worked. It got a little too complex with Batman Returns and some of the style started to stray with that one. The less said about the next two, the better. Batman Begins was really exciting because from the first trailer I saw I knew that this was going to be the one to turn it around. Gone are the stupid sidekicks and over-the-top music (though it's a shame the batman theme from the original isn't in there). <br /> <br />Begins totally revamps the Batman formula, giving it a much harder and more realistic edge. The costume of batman is incredible, a lot more thought was put into it this time. The Batmobile is no longer a weird thing with fins coming off it but a real vehicle. And cool as hell. The editing is hard and fast, wrapping you up in the story and not letting you go. Acting is well done, with top-notch performances from everyone, including Christian Bale who I think did a wonderful job bringing back some dignity to the character of Bruce Wayne who had gotten a 2-D and cardboard during the last few movies. You really believe this guy could be Batman. <br /> <br />Villains in this are a lot more complicated in this than the other movies, at least in my opinion, because there's not just one main super-arch-nemesis. It requires a bit more thinking but doesn't detract from the film, but enhances it. Oh, thankyou Christopher Nolan! Don't you ever let Warner Bros get that Schumacher guy anywhere near Batman again! <br /> <br />They've got a winner on their hands here, and if they let Nolan do another it'll mean big things for the Batman franchise. I can't wait for the DVD and for the inevitable sequel. Keep it coming.
B0002IU988|5.0|Myles is the most amazing singer out there right now, his voice is simply amazing and it will shock you and soothe you at the same time. Combined with the talent of Mark Tremonti and Brian and Scott you really can't go wrong. If you really want to experience this music though you need to see them live because the album will pale in comparison! I love the Alter Bridge!!
B0009F9O6M|5.0|Another beautiful, intense gem from VDGG, from beggining to end.  The squid extra track is a treasure.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Words can't really describe how much I love and appreciate this album. It's great music created by a stellar band. AROBTTH was impressive, but X&Y is a step ahead and a step beyond all of my expectations. Who knew that Rock music could elevate you in this fashion. Coldplay found a way to make a familiar genre new again. This is what music should be like. It should challenge the senses and take the listener on an unexpected journey. That's what X&Y does. That's what Coldplay does best. This album is terrific. I highly recommend Coldplay's new album as well as their previous recordings.
B0009F9O6W|5.0|Pawn hearts is between the 10 best records of prog rock ever. Very dark, intense, incredible singing, compositions and instrumental execution. A real trip.  If you like prog, buy it at once.  <br />The new remasters are great. <br />Also recomended: still life, godbluff, H to He, maida Vale, The least we can do, and the first Peter Hammill solo works.
B0002OERI0|5.0|When I first heard \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" I loved it.  Call it cheesy pop punk rock, but I could not stop singing it and wanting to hear it.  I bought the album and was really surprised.  I love it!  I'm generally a classic hard rock fan (Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, etc.) but I really like this album.  The songs poke at American politics, which is always good to hear -- musicians taking a stand.  The musicality of the songs is great too.  I love the lyrics and the tunes are great to rock out to with the windows down and on full blast.  Great album for all hard rock fans.
0670033375|4.0|I enjoyed the authors somewhat balanced view of the impact of environmental catastrophe on many societies throughout history.  Though we can guess on which side of many environmental issues that he leans, he does well in positioning both sides of many questions. <br /> <br />The example of Easter Island is exceptionally chilling.  The inhabitants basically denuded their island of trees to build the impressive stone statues they left to show their power.  The author asks what could the person who chopped down the last tree been thinking?  With no trees there were no more canoes to catch fish and dolphins, no more rope, and with soil erosion depleted gardens.  The population fell from several thousand to several hundred by the time the first european explorers arrived. <br /> <br />The author takes the lessons of the past and shows how fragile our modern first world economy really is in the long term.
0385510454|2.0|I was told this is Grisham's \\"come back\\" book, and that was the only reason I decided to read it. This book was a huge disappoint. It starts off pretty much like Grisham's more exciting books, and quickly devolves into a badly written Italian travelogue. If you want to learn all about Bologna, get this book!! If you want to learn Italian, get this book!!! If you want a \\"edge of the seat\\" thriller, go somewhere else and save your money.
020530902X|5.0|My well worn copy of Strunk and White has been a constant companion to me the past 30 years.  No MS Word style and grammer editor can ever take its place.  Along with Margaret Shertzer's Elements of Grammar, and the New York Times guide to Editing, this book should find itself a place on the desk of any serious writer even if your accumulated published works only consist of a few well thought out letters to the editor of the local paper.<br /><br />I have recently provided a copy for my home schooled 13 year old to improve his writing.  Its a book that will never go out of style as long as English continues to be written.
B0000256VK|5.0|There are two camps of Roxy Music fans. Fans of the old style Roxy and then the other camp that loves this album and maybe FLESH AND BLOOD.  I am one of a select group of people who can wander freely in and out of both camps. I don't mean for this to sound pretentious or condescending,as that is not the point of this review.<br /><br />Roxy Music was a very different group in the late 60's and early 70's. They were experimental,novel, and fully original. To sum up the early work is easy,if your a fan it takes only two words. THEY ROCKED!! As time passed and the band went on hiatus for a time in the mid 70's, they emerged with a slowly evolving sound. Each sucessive album from STRANDED,SIREN and FLESH AND BLOOD hinted at the changing sound more and more. Finally came AVALON a very stylized album that brought the name Roxy Music to the lips of many who had never heard of them.<br /><br />Now the early fans rang the deathknell on their beloved Roxy upon the release of this album, while still others joined the ranks swimming in a pool of adulation for this masterpiece. Both camps are neither right or wrong. Roxy music grew up,in a sense. We all grow older and change and if you are the same person you were ten or twenty years ago then you need help, because you're not progressing and your spinning your wheels. Roxy grew up and their sound became less edgy and more about simple melody and ballads. However they did this style better than perhaps any band in the history of rock. So it is not a sell out, as old style fans would suggest, only a maturation of their sound. If Roxy had indeed SOLD OUT then you would hear them constantly on the cheesy radio stations. How many times have you heard Roxy on the radio?? Aside from MORE THAN THIS. Even with their more mellow sound they could not get the masses behind them. That is a good thing though,maybe not for Ferry&Co.,but certainly for those of us who enjoy music that is not always playing for a mass appeal.<br /><br />Now for those of you who love this album, but have never heard much else from the world of ROXY,you may want to perk up your ears and give a listen to earlier stuff. I would suggest you work backwards through their catalog ( i. e. Flesh&Blood,Siren,Standed......) this will allow you a chance to adjust to the edgier Roxy before you reach albums such as; FOR YOUR PLEASURE or the brillant self titled debut. If you like the sound of Ferry's voice and you'd like to hear a more rock and roll sound accompany it,you owe it to yourself to give early Roxy a chance. If however you only enjoy the laid back romantic,martini time sound of AVALON then you may be content with only owning this album. That is too bad though, because those of us who wander in and out of both camps find ourselves over here in the OTHER camp sometimes JUST ROCKING OUT to a Phil M. guitar solo. Well good luck with your purchase and hope to see you in both camps someday.hose of you who love this album, but have never heard much else from the world of ROXY,you may want to perk up your ears and give a listen to earlier stuff.

It is out there. Good luck in finding it. Should not be hard to find. It is absolutely exquisite! <br />Melinda
B00004RF9B|5.0|Fifty years after its theatrical release FORBIDDEN PLANET still ranks as one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever created. Of it's contemporaries, only 1951's THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL approaches its intelligence and depth. Not until Stanley Kubrick brought us 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was another science-fiction film to take such a thought-provoking approach to the human condition.<br /><br />Much of the credit for the excellence of FORBIDDEN PLANET has to go to its ultimate source material, THE TEMPEST, Shakespeare's last (and arguably greatest) play.<br /><br />A number of reviewers have mentioned \\"some Shakespear play\\" (sic) as the inspiration for this film, and others have admitted, \\"I haven't read it.\\" I strongly recommend that anyone even mildly interested in FORBIDDEN PLANET read THE TEMPEST, and secondarily, that anyone who speaks English acquaint themselves with the Bard of Avon (that's Shakespeare, in case you didn't know...at the very least spell his name correctly!)<br /><br />The film stars Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius (Prospero), Anne Francis as his daughter Altaira (Miranda), Robby the Robot as himself (Ariel), and the Invisible Monster From the Id in the Caliban role.<br /><br />The Forbidden Planet is visited by the crew of the spaceship C-57-D, captained by a very young, very earnest Leslie Nielsen. He is accompanied by his First Officer and Ship's Doctor with whom he trades constant wisecracks (if this all sounds familiar, it's because FORBIDDEN PLANET counts STAR TREK as one of its numerous progeny). FORBIDDEN PLANET's plot also inspired more than one episode of that show.<br /><br />The Robot of LOST IN SPACE owes his existence to Robby the Robot (who later appeared in other pictures besides FORBIDDEN PLANET, a groundbreaking idea at the time). LOST IN SPACE's Jupiter II is a copy of the C-57-D. STAR TREK and LOST IN SPACE were both produced within a decade of FORBIDDEN PLANET, and their creators have credited the film as seminal.<br /><br />C-57-D is searching for survivors of a human colony on the planet. As it turns out, the only survivors are the imperious Dr. Morbius, his irresistibly sexy and utterly innocent twentysomething daughter, Altaira, and Robby the Robot.<br /><br />Morbius informs them that all is fine on the Forbidden Planet and bades them go on their way. Suspicious for no particular reason, the Captain and his pals decide to overstay their welcome. In recounting the history of the planet, Morbius explains that it was once the home of a superintellectual race called the Krell, and that the Krell were destroyed by some unknown force at the very height of their powers. After having the Captain stick his feet in the fire, Morbius admits that the rest of the colonists died as a result of contact with this unknown force. The words are barely out of Morbius' mouth when the crew of C-57-D reports several mysterious deaths.<br /><br />Most of the rest of the film revolves around efforts to battle what turns out to be an invisible monster bent on mindless destruction. The origins of the monster cause one to consider the conundrum of the atomic age: whether a mankind bent on technological advancement is better off than a mankind that lived in a simpler time.<br /><br />FORBIDDEN PLANET never lags. The script is well-honed, and the story moves along at a rapid clip (even for 1956), always keeping the viewer's attention.<br /><br />The dialogue is furiously funny at times. Besides the ongoing byplay between the Captain and his cronies, Earl Holliman hams it up as the ship's often-inebriated cook, who strikes up a satisfyingly one-sided business relationship with Robby the Robot. Altaira is gently amusing. Never having met any man besides her father, she is wide-eyed and curious about the visitors. After the men lead her in some discussion on the subject, she decides she just MUST practice her kissing, a task for which the dedicated crew volunteers at every available moment thereafter.<br /><br />Thevery attractive Anne Francis (TV's HONEY WEST) is fitted out in some criminally short minidresses which are slam-dunk guaranteed to hold the attention of a typical heterosexual male viewer. A few of her dresses were banned by studio censors as being too much (or too little) and were not used in the film. Her wardrobe definitely gave impetus to the female crew uniforms on STAR TREK. The actual costumes in this movie were later used in the less-than-memorable low-budget QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE, starring Zsa Zsa Gabor as a Venusian woman with a Budapest accent (!). A practice kissing sequence also made it into that film.<br /><br />Miss Francis is the acknowledged original \\"Space Babe.\\" Though Altaira is essentially a sex kitten role, she manages to imbue the character with dignity and humor, and gives a memorable performance.<br /><br />The sets are all posh and wonderfully futuristic (in a 1950s Swedish modern sort of way). The special effects were cutting-edge for their time. MGM spared no expense in producing this big-budget color picture and hired Disney Studios to create the effects. (Yes, they look rather dated now, but considering they are fifty years old, they hold up surprisingly well against today's CGI.) The electronic soundtrack is still a definite attention-getter.<br /><br />With its balanced mix of science fiction, comedy, and classic drama, FORBIDDEN PLANET stands as one of the finest movies ever made.y short minidresses which are slam-dunk guaranteed to hold the attention of a typical heterosexual male viewer.

0805079076|4.0|Guy Deutscher makes learning about language fun in his book The Unfolding Of Language. Deutscher, a mathematician turned linguist, has a great sense of humor and a joy for his subject that comes through in his writing.  The author takes what could be a really dry subject [think back to language classes [both English and foreign] in high school - bet you really liked conjugating all those verbs!] and most of the time makes it glide by as the reader gets a fairly deep education on the evolution of language.  My biggest complaint about the book [and the reason for my agonized over 4 star rating] is that it starts to feel like overtime has been called towards the end of the book.  I think Deutscher already had a sense of this since what could've ended up as 5 more chapters [or at least additions to 5 existing chapters] are attached at the back of the book as Appendices A through F.  I have nothing against detail, but would've liked to have seen more of the material sent to the back of the book as extended notes or another appendix. Still, I feel that The Unfolding Of Language is a very worthwhile read, worth the effort, and I learned a lot and had a good time doing it!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought OK Computer in the week it came out, a full eight years ago now. I was in my formative adolescent years, and embarrassingly had bought little music but singles before. Spurred on by the appealing oddness of 'Paranoid Android', I trekked up to a record shop one lunchtime at school and bought a copy. I'd heard of glowing critical reviews of it and wanted to like it, but after a couple of listens it all blended into one. <br /> <br />A year or so later, having rectified my ways and started to buy music routinely, I picked it up again - and it blew me away. Make no mistake, it wasn't an easy listen at first, but it's a truly remarkable album.  <br /> <br />Aggressive and cynical in turns, raw and emotional at others, every song is layered and structured beautifully - revealing a little more on each listen. Eight years on and OK Computer rings just as true as it ever did, and is one of the most complete and affecting albums you're ever likely to find.  <br />
B000063DFS|5.0|After a pretty good but not spectacular debut with \\"No Rest For the Wicked\\" (which was by no means a bad album), many were intrigued by Ozzy's new guitarist.  Some thought he could be the next Randy Rhoads (R.I.P.); some thought he was better than Rhoads.  While I don't totally disagree with the first statement, I still feel that there is no replacement for Ozzy's first and greatest guitarist.  Anyway, while the guitar work on \\"No Rest For the Wicked\\" was good, it was marred by the album's overall muddy production (especially noticeable on the percussion aspect).  Fortunately, Wylde was given the chance to shine on \\"No More Tears,\\" which I consider to be one of the best Ozzy CDs.  It really shows how well the band can rock out, and it features some of their most popular music.  The opening song \\"Mr. Tinkertrain\\" starts out with an intro similar to the one from \\"Bloodbath in Paradise,\\" but this song goes in a much different direction.  It is a great opener, and one of the best songs on the CD.  \\"I Don't Want to Change the World\\" is up next, and it is one of the songs that brought Ozzy into the mainstream.  Although I prefer the live rendition, the studio version is still good.  \\"Mama, I'm Coming Home,\\" another song that everyone knows, displays a mellower side of Ozzy, and the intro has a bit of a Southern rock sound to it.  \\"Desire,\\" another popular hit from this CD, is pretty good, but not on the same level as the previous three.  \\"No More Tears\\" is the album's seven-minute-plus title track.  It starts with an infectious bass intro, then kicks into one of the greatest, albeit disturbing, Ozzy songs ever written.  \\"S.I.N.\\" is the forgotten classic of this CD, and for some reason it has been included on neither of Ozzy's \\"greatest hits\\" compilations, even though it is more fit than most songs.  \\"Hellraiser\\" is another great song which, for some strange reason beyond my comprehension, is often overlooked.  \\"Time After Time\\" slows things down a little, and it's anotherone of the more popular songs on the album.  \\"Zombie Stomp\\" is a cheesy yet irresistable song that you'll want to hear again and again.  \\"A.V.H.\\" isn't really that memorable, but after a few listens it will start to grow on you.  \\"Road to Nowhere\\" is a sorrowful song in which Ozzy sings about his regrets and how \\"the road of nowhere leads to [him]\\".  The bonus songs \\"Don't Blame Me\\" and Party with the Animals\\" are decent, but they lack the flair that the rest of the album possesses.  Overall, I really like this CD.  Sure, it's no \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" or \\"Diary of a Madman,\\" but then again, how could Ozzy ever match those without the help of Randy Rhoads?  Zakk Wylde is still a great player, though, and his ample talents are best displayed here.  If you don't own this CD, I highly recommend you purchase it as soon as possible.
B00080ZG10|1.0|This movie is an absolutely terrible viewing experience.The  movie totally focuses on Hughe's mental illness, and commits the crime of glorifying it.Whatever happened to entertainment?<br /><br />Whatever happened to having an enjoyable experience of watching a film?
B00005K3NR|5.0|in contrary with some said, this is not a suspense/horror movie. it's not even a thriller. It's a very good teenage movie with excellent directing and brilliant actings and except some strong nudity scenes, there is no problem for persons over 13 to watch it and I think these thays children learn worse tricks in school! this movie really makes sense and after watching it, most of people would not say something negative about it. the DVD release is very good too and special edition dvd is full of really good special features! buying this dvd may not be a good recommandation for everyone cause this is a one time movie and after first time you may have no eager to watch it again. but I strongly suggest everyone rent it at least and watch it once. this is one of that famous rather classic movies that you must see!
B0001MDP3G|1.0|This movie was terrible in so many ways.<br /><br />1) Nicole Kidman is almost forty,but she plays a woman in her early to mid twenties(unconvincingly)<br /><br />2)The setting for this film was supposedly in the South but, where are the slaves? Apparently this is the only Southern town where no one owns a slave.<br /><br />3) Southern society was very structured and formal. Their women led very restricted lives-yet Nicole Kidman<br />  1-Walks up to a man she hasn't been introduced to and<br />  starts a conversation<br />  2- Walks around town all by herself<br />  3- (IN the scene where Inman visits her house during the<br />  rain) Was intending to visit slave quarters by herself<br />  4-wears trousers<br /><br />4) Kidman's character is supposedly well educated but apparently is too stupid to know that she must work to eat.<br /><br />5) Kidman's character falls in \\"love\\" with a  man she has spent maybe 15 minutes with. Apparantly this is enough to sustain her for about four years.<br /><br />6)  A preacher is portrayed as a drunkard, a near murderer,<br />  and a fornicator.<br /><br />7) This is actually quite a political movie. It makes a very strong anti-war statement.Deserters are heroes, \\"home guard\\" people are evil.The only good people are the ones who hate war.<br /><br />8) The three main actors,Kidman,Zellweger,and Law are all three way too old for the characters they play.<br /><br />9) THe production design is infantile, and not believable.<br /><br />10) This movie has a horrible ending, and aftwards, I wished I hadn't seen the movie.<br /><br />I wouldn't reccomend this movie to anyone who still has the ability to reason. I find it very sad and scary that the book(which is even worse) and the film were wildly popular. We have forgotten how to use our minds, and to reason.
B00008YJHC|4.0|The Pixies have the unusual distinction of having a small catalogue (4 albums/1 ep) all of which are minor masterpieces (yes, even Trompe le Monde). Two of their albums, Doolittle and Surfa Rosa are iconic classics, but this album is my dark favourite and I think a lot of Pixies fans will feel particularly attached to this record. It's the first album by the band that feels very produced, shedding the raw, almost improvised slack of Surfa Rosa and Come on Pilgrim. But the album rides a fascinating line between being contained by it's production and pushing the emotion and force of the music to it's limits. This is their pop album if you like, but it's dark pop. I like it because it demonstrates to other contemporary bands (very few can match it with the talent and bravado of the Pixies) just how stellar tunes on a pop album can be whilst pushing the range of emotion beyond the feigned cliches of the 'indie' scene. Check out the irresistable driving 'Dig for Fire', the beautiful, haunting 'Ana', the darkly punk 'Is she Weird' and the sardonic, playful 'All Over the World'. The tracks keep the classic Pixie format of 2 minute power pop compositions. There are no excess notes and no self indulgent rock posturing, just hardcore, imaginitive, guitar driven tunes, cranked out for the love of music, not for the love of themselves. When you hear them at their best, the Pixies definitely have some claim to being the most influential and consistently brilliant band of the past 20 years. Bossa Nova maintains the standard, and is essential to your Pixies collection.

B0006L16N8|1.0|I don't think I have ever heard a band (Coldplay) so blatantly rip-off another band (U2).  I keep thinking Bono's voice is going to jump in at any moment during any of these songs.  I wonder if U2 is getting royalties ?? If not, they should be.  Save your money and play your U2 Cd's instead -- at least you'll know it's the original.
B0002858YS|2.0|'Mr Brightside' is a great song, a little overplayed, but a great song. that is the extent of the praise I will give this album. <br />Brandon Flowers is your classic manufactured pop star, nothing special lyrically or vocally, no real stage presence but he gets by on his enormous... ego and his feminine appearance which the girls go 'gaga' for. <br />on the album vocally it is below par, the bass is simple and frustratingly dull, the guitar is energetic yet flat and the drumming... well, the drumming isn't that bad. <br />Don't get this album, not all it's cracked up to be.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Forget all the nonsense talk here about how Lucas changed these movies; he didn't. To the average (normal) person, the changes are not a big deal, if even noticable.

It's such a smutty book, it's not worth picking through the trash to find the adventure/mystery plot lurking beneath.

B00014TJ7K|5.0|With the afterglow of my personal discovery of the Beatles in full swing, the release of what would turn out to be George Harrison's penultimate solo album, Cloud Nine, well, put me there.  After getting greatest hits albums by Paul McCartney and John Lennon, this was perfect.  George had a lot of quality help on this album, including former bandmate Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Gary Wright, Elton John, and on the producer's helm, Jeff Lynne.<br /><br />Most of the material is laid back pop, with George's gentle and understated voice an additional balm.  \\"That's What It Takes\\" is one such song, on how in order to enjoy the shining world, one has to take all those chances.<br /><br />However, the great heartfelt ballads are what make Cloud Nine.  The tearful piano ballad \\"Just For Today\\" is great for those who are very down and need \\"to get through this day only\\" and other things somehow:  \\"If just for one night/I could feel not sad and lonely/Not be my own life's problem/Just for one night.\\"  It shows that it wasn't just Paul McCartney who could make a universal ballad like \\"Yesterday.\\"  Equally as sad and touching is \\"Someplace Else\\" of needing that certain someone during a time of crisis:  \\"And for a while you could comfort me/And hold me for some time/I need you now to be beside me/While all my world is so untidy/Loneliness/Empty faces/Wish i could leave them all in someplace else.\\"  Clapton helps out on this song.<br /><br />The quick \\"Fish On The Sand\\" features Jeff Lynne's signature production, that backbeat rhythm synths and guitar also to be present on the Traveling Wilburys' \\"Handle With Care\\" and Tom Petty's \\"I Won't Back Down\\" and \\"Learning To Fly.\\"  A similar sound is present on the third single, \\"This Is Love.\\"<br /><br />Okay, what is \\"white and black like industrial waste/Pollution of the highest degree\\"?  If you answered the \\"Devil's Radio,\\" give yourself a hand.  George gives a much-needed punch at the gossip magazines, radio, and TV, but oh, with such a fun sound.  \\"It's all across our lives/Like a weed it's spread/'till nothing else has space to grow,\\" sings George of this menace.  Clapton lends his bluesy guitar here and also on the brass and piano boogie of \\"Wreck of the Hesperus.\\"  This is how George feels great about himself at present, with some witty repartee:  \\"I'm not a power of attorney/But I can rock as good as Gibraltar/Ain't no more no spring chicken/Been plucked but I'm still kicking.\\"<br /><br />Naturally, the silly video for the fun and upbeat \\"Got My Mind Set On You,\\" the song which reached #1 and was George's third chart-topper, after \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Give Me Love-(Give Me Peace On Earth)\\" started things off.  A song written by Rudy Clark in the 50's, it was first recorded by James Ray in 1962.  A brisk rhythm guitar is accompanied by some brass and later sax, which in the video was played by a squirrel!<br /><br />The next single was George's remembrance of the Beatles.  \\"When We Was Fab\\" features sounds that harken back to the Beatles' Sgt Peppers and Magical Mystery Tour, including cello, sitar.  Even the video had Elton John in a walrus costume a la MMT.  Reaching #23, this was George's last Top 40 hit.<br /><br />As for the bonus tracks, they were songs for the Madonna/Sean Penn bomb Shanghai Surprise.  Vicky Brown assists him on vocals on the title track, which has a Chinese aura.  \\"Zig Zag\\" has a more 30's nightclub jazz feel to it, complete with Armstrong-style trumpet.

B0006L16N8|5.0|What more is there to say? You have to hear it to believe it. This is Coldplay's best album and the best of the year also. It's one of the most confident and self-assured albums I've ever heard. Coldplay isn't afraid to be different. That is their best asset when it comes to recording great music. They don't have to fit in. It's not about being and sounding like everyone else. Coldplay just might be the greatest group of explorers to ever become musicians, because they have discovered sound like no other. They know how to use it well. Their new album is a good example of when things work well, they work masterfully. Excellent job.
B000000W5F|5.0|With many considering 1980's Emotional Rescue as warmed-up leftovers from Some Girls, though I'm not one of them, perhaps that is why listeners embraced Tattoo You, generally considered the Stones' best and probably only great album of the 1980's.  If anything this shows them going back to their roots, albeit updating it for the decade, particularly with some guitar work showing they still have teeth.<br /><br />Perhaps it was due to the Stones coming up with another classic song, with those three recognizable beginning guitar riffs.  The hard-edged stomp of \\"Start Me Up\\" proved the Stones still had it in them.  This song seemed poised to take the top spot on the singles chart, only to have Hall & Oates' \\"Private Eyes\\" leapfrog over it.  Three weeks at #2-oh well!  Of course, it got restarted up when Microsoft was busy flogging Windows 95 to the general public.  Thank goodness it has had time to rest so we can all enjoy it once again.<br /><br />Next comes the rollicking doo wop meets rockabilly of \\"Hang Fire,\\" complete with falsetto harmonies, the third single from the album that barely scratched the Top 20.<br /><br />The leisurely mid-paced romp of \\"Slave\\" has the same harmonies of \\"Hang Fire\\" intercut with a sax solo, a lingering guitar solo, and snatches of piano throughout.<br /><br />\\"She's my little rock 'n' roll/my t-ts and a-- with soul baby,\\" sings Keith Richards in the updated 50's rock of \\"Little T&A,\\" showing that they haven't abandoned any of their trademark naughtiness behind.  Another 50's-influenced track is the racing rocker \\"Neighbours,\\" where Jagger tells his neighbors to stay away from his woman and quit eating his food while he's working hard, along with the Confucian ethic of \\"do unto strangers, do unto your neighbours what you do to yourself, yourself, yourself.\\"<br /><br />Classic blues time, harmonica included, with \\"Black Limousine\\" on how rock stars look back at their glory days riding in said cars with girls in tow, and seeing how they look  now.

Finally, the album ends with the second single, the reflective #13 \\"Waiting On A Friend,\\" with some philosophy of women, the love game, and real needs and \\"don't needs\\" of a man mixed in for good measure:  \\"A smile relieves a heart that grieves.\\"  This song also benefits from a sax delivery by Sonny Rollins.<br /><br />Tattoo You shows a lot of polish, and although there is a few filler tracks, the whole album is consistent and strong in delivery.  Not as good as Some Girls, but it's one of their better albums.  Wish I could say the same for Undercover, but that's another review away.how they look  now.

B00092ZMDY|4.0|There are a lot of DVDs out there featuring concerts that have been edited, showing only parts of the performances and what not.  Fortunately the Eagles didn't take that route with this DVD as the entire concert is shown featuring excellent picture and sound.   <br /> <br />The set list pretty much covers all the big hits, save for a few (\\"Best Of My Love\\", \\"James Dean\\", and \\"Victim of Love\\" were missed).  The Eagles were never known for being an electrifying band live as they've always dedicated making their live performances sound as close to the studio recordings as possible. Which is both a good thing and a bad thing.  A good thing because you're getting a polished performance.  A bad thing because the performances tend to come off a little stiff.  Thankfully Joe Walsh (easily the most entertaining person in the band) manages to keep his songs fairly loose. <br /> <br />The performances themselves are very solid.  Don Henley is finally starting to show his age, but is still in very fine voice (even though he cheats a little and performs a few of his solo songs in a lower key).  I find it interesting that Henley dedicates \\"Dirty Laundry\\" to FoxNews daddy Rupert Murdoch.  Considering recent blasphemous reporting by such \\"credible\\" sources as Newsweek and CBS that got them in hot water, it is fairly amusing that, like a good liberal, Henley turns a blind eye to them and attacks those no-good conservatives instead.  When will they ever learn? <br /> <br />Anyways, political comments aside, this is an excellent DVD of the band containing solid performances and a good selection of songs.  Certainly worth the purchase!
B00080EU58|5.0|\\"I am a world before I am a man/I was a creature before I could stand\\" - some of the best lines of Slipknot's massive career. Now, they just may have found their niche with the beautifully aggressive \\"Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses,\\" which was carefully crafted by the band to be the centerpiece of their on-going career. Slipknot fans please take note: while there are some chillingly haunting moments with the acoustic strums found here and there, Slipknot remains only one thing: Slipknot.  First off, the strange dirge of the opening track \\"Prelude 3.0\\" will leave you reeling and wondering what's next, and the disc's only truly creepy vibe comes with the oddly spacey \\"Danger - Keep Away\\" (which comes in it's full 7 minute plus version on disc 2 of the 2-disc treat). The pulsing throb of drums and vicious teething guitar on \\"Duality\\" make you understand that Slipknot remain aggressive, and more purely so then some of their peers before them. The centerpiece of the disc is without a doubt \\"Before I Forget,\\" which spins the ultimate militaristic guitar riff and chaotic drumming with Corey Taylor's seething vocal spit, and lines like the one mentioned at the beginning of this review are truly some of the best Corey has ever written. But \\"Forget's\\" aggressive nature is inviting, and the urge to bang your head becomes all the more evident. It's the Slipknot fan's ultimate thrill, and it doesn't stop there. The unrelenting attack of \\"Opium of the People\\" is chaotic too, with time changes and thundering percussion underlaying the searing guitars that layer most of the 14 tracks found here.   But the most surprising moments on the disc are the two counterparts found in \\"Vermillion\\" and \\"Vermillion Pt. 2\\".   \\"Vermillion\\" is the dark, sinister, and hauntingly agitated Slipknot with the creepy verses and the precision drum and guitar work interweaving the deeply trodden lines \\"I won't let this build up inside of me\\" in a more evil vibe. But \\"Vermillion Pt. 2\\" breathes a totally different side of Slipknot never seen - acoustic guitars, dreamy vibe, and Corey's aching vocals, which almost sing to the girl in his life letting him know that he would do anything just to \\"have her for myself.\\" \\"Pulse of the Maggots\\" returns to pure aggression, and \\"The Nameless\\" keeps the vibe going. Over 60 minutes, Slipknot manages to be both haunting and nightmarish.  The second disc features a couple of unreleased tracks like the crunching \\"Scream\\" and the Terry Date remix of \\"Vermillion\\", which almost sounds like disc one's predecessor, but more bite than bark to it. The four live tracks showcased all carry the signature Slipknot stamp, with (...) winning the bout as heaviest, meanest of all four.   With \\"Verses\\", Slipknot have delivered what many open-minded Slipknot fans love - Slipknot. So bang your heads, break out the air drums and guitars, and sink deep into the grind of the masterpiece that is \\"Vol. 3\\". (Buy the two-disc set while it lasts!!)
B00005JNJT|5.0|This is by far the way Batman should be portrayed in the movies.  I have been waiting to see a movie that shows Batman(Bruce Wayne) the way he should be; dark, mysterious, and real.  This is that movie.   This movie is so real; you can just see this really happening in real life.  Christian Bale has the look, feal, and acting ability to be Batman and Bruce Wayne. He plays the part with such dedication and strength. The villains in the film are realistic as well.  No cheesy villains like in the Spider-Man movies.  The Scarecrow is frightening and well done.  Even though he is a little underdeveloped, but it still works, because it is a movie about Bruce Wayne!!          Even the Tim Burton films lack what Batman is really about.  If you watch the first Batman movie now you will see that it is cheesy, like the corny Joker.  They have their moments but are mostly cheesy, campy, and unrealistic.  Not this new film.  I just hope they (Nolan, Goyer, Bale) make many many more.
B00006JDS4|4.0|I rented this way back in the day when renting videos was so new, there wasn't even any tax charged for them. I was an avid horror fan and I frequently rented films like \\"2000 Maniacs\\" \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and \\"I Dis-member Mama.\\" I remember watching one particuarly disturbing film (the name escapes me) and a guy had just cut out his dead girlfriend's heart and took a big ole bite out of it. My dad who had just happened to walk into the room said, \\"that's sick. And you have to be sick to watch it.\\" <br /> <br />But few films stay with me in such a disturbing way as \\"I Spit on Your Grave.\\" Several years later I would go on to work with rape survivors so in that light, I find the film even more disturbing.  <br /> <br />Is it entertainment, is it art? That debate will rage on forever, but I would recommend this film for the gore-hounds, the horror fans. I wouldn't recommend it to general movie fans. I personally have a hard time putting my finger on its redeeming artisitc qualities. Rape is not sex. It is the act of using sex as a weapon of violence and it is the sheer violence that leaves an impression and not the acting, direction, camera work or other artistic metrics.  Despite that though, it is not what I would call a \\"gore\\" movie. It relies on certain perceptions to create the \\"horror\\" in the viewer's mind, but nonetheless, little is left to the imagination. Although my mom is not a horror fan by any stretch of the imagination she watched it and really enjoyed it which surprised me as she's fairly conservative (socially, not politically). Outside of a handfull of films you'd have to go outside the U.S. to Japan to find worse or better, depending on your point of view. <br />Personally I prefer a more supernatural film be it a gore fest or something more psychological like \\"The Haunting.\\" Now, \\"The Exorcist\\"! That's a total package. But nonetheless, I give it four stars for the dvd though which is packed with lots of cool extras and insights and it is very edgy film making for better or worse. Hollywood is content to recycle old themes and cliches that are quickly forgotten and warrant no discussion. I Spit on Your Grave still pushes the envelope and is worth viewing even if it is just your morbid curiousity wanting to know what the fuss is about.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Batman series. Tim Burton created films with dark undertones and flamboyent villains. After he and Keaton left, the series became extremely epic if losing some of its apeal. I was beginning to think the series would never recover. <br /> <br />Even in the Burton days, however, I always felt that something was missing from the series. The movies were great looking with great action, but they seemed to have a huge difficulty understanding why and how a rich orphan would be compelled to vigilante justice and dress like a flying mammal. When asked why in 1989's Batman, Wayne stated \\"Because no one else can.\\" I liked the movie, but that just sounds like a bored writer taking the easy way out. <br /> <br />Christopher Nolan, in this latest and greatest installment, has made an entire film on the premise of that question. He provides a deeper look into Bruce Wayne, who in the previous films was shown as a bored billionaire who wants to make some halfassed contribution to society by buying gadgets and hanging junkies off rooftops. Now, he's a tortured sole who comes to the realization that before he can exorcise Gotham's demons he has to exorcise his own. <br /> <br />The film opens in a Tibetan prison where Wayne has confined himself so he can fight the inmates. When a hulking Asian goon informs him, \\"This is Hell and I am the devil,\\" Bruce nonchalantly replies, \\"You're not the devil. You're practice,\\" before unleashing his rage onto him and five other inmates. The guards lock him up for protection, but Bruce insists he needs none. \\"Not yours, theirs!\\" <br /> <br />He is recruited by the League of Shadows and journeys into his own fears that he might turn it against the villains of Gotham. He is trained by Liam Neeson, who reveals harsh truths about his society, justice, and his past, \\"Your parents' death wasn't your fault...it was your father's!\\" Nolan delivers these philosophies as devoutly as DeMill delivered the Ten Commandments, but whenWayne's training ends, he realizes that the League is no less corrupt than the villains they fight. <br /> <br />He returns to Gotham having destroyed the League's headquarters, killed all its members, and been declared legaly dead after an eight year absence. He returns to a city that is not only corrupt and run down, but in denial. One of the things I loved about the film was the fact that it took time to develop Gotham's history. It never fully recovered from the Depression that hit it twenty years earlier, the city's worst criminals are running the show, and a deranged psychiatrist conducts unnatural experiments at Arkham Asylum. <br /> <br />Bruce struggles to gain the necessary compontents to make Batman a reality while still maintaining a playboy persona to avoid suspicion. He slowly masses his resources while immediately plunging into war against an entire city of enemies. By the end of the film little has actually gotten better, but Gotham has a symbolic hope from their new hero. Bruce Wayne, however, has disappeared. He is a mask that Batman wears. <br /> <br />This film is not afraid to delve into the true nature of the basest of human emotions and conditions. It provides honesty and realism to a genre that so often lacks it. The questions are not easy, but the answers are even harder. <br /> <br />FIVE STARS...the best superhero film of all time

B00006JK1R|4.0|The story's entertaining and there are plenty of laughs, but the original was way better.  Still, I'm glad they made this movie and I'm glad I saw it.  It isn't so bad that MIB III is out of the question (I hope).
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This IS Sergio Leone's best work. Period. Oh, and one last thing...anybody who thinks Clint Eastwood should have played Harmonica instead of Charles Bronson...just doesn't get it. No disrespect toward Clint, but Bronson owned this role.

B0009IW88A|2.0|Many reviewers have noted that Zimmer and Howard have abandoned Elfman's themes and approaches to Batman.  While the composers were certainly rigth to do so (after all, who's going to top Elfman at his own game?), in my opinion they did not create a new and refreshing work, but rather another mediocer Hollywood score.  What makes Elfman, Shore, or Williams so memberable is the fact that they compose self contained musical works that happen to be attached to a movie.  In contrast, Zimmer and Howard have composed a few minutes of mood music that, without Nolan's film filling in the blanks, convey nothing of importance.  This makes for an excellent movie, but a rather uninteresting score.
B000063DFS|5.0|no more tears is one of the best albums from the great ozzy osbourne along with bark at the moon and the ultimate sin.music does not getter than this folks.IF YOU DONT HAVE IT,BUY IT.HUGELY RECOMMENDED.
0446677450|2.0|Within the first few chapters, I was intrigued but then the book went too much into having to own your own business/be your own boss to be successful.  I understand that thinking but don't have the want or ambition to own my own company, even with the tax savings involved. This book helped to change my thinking about liabilities and assets, which was the biggest asset of the book!  The essence of the book is to concentrate on accumulating assets (that which puts money in your pocket, money-earning; stocks, bonds, etc) instead of concentrating on accumulating liabilities which are non-money earning material items (car, house, electronics, etc). As quoted in the book, \\"Keep your expenses low, reduce your liabilities and diligently build a base of solid assets.\\" If you want a better financial guide suggestion, read Smart Couples Finish Rich by David Bach which gives much better guidance on investing and managing your money.
B0006L16N8|5.0|The songs on here are very good. Highlights: WHITE SHADOWS, WHAT IF, SPEED OF SOUND, SQUARE ONE, A MESSAGE, TWISTED LOGIC, THE HARDEST PART. I'm impressed because I've never been a big fan of Colplay and I don't buy that much Rock music. So the fact that I'm really liking this CD does come as a surprise to me. I would encourage people to try it and judge for themselves.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I can't believe the creators of much loved SouthPark could come up with such brainless nonsense.  Great disappointment in the movie, in the uncomplicated political views of its creators, and especially in their outrageous uncivil attacks on people of different views.  I wish I could give it 0 stars, minus five would be even better.  Never seeing another one of their movies again.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman Begins takes the series back to where it should be; following the comic. The previous two deviated way too much from the atmosphere of the comic, relying instead on the camp of the 1965 series. Christian Bale is the best Bruce Wayne since Michael Keaton. The plot is a little convoluted, but ties together neatly at the end. This is likely a little long for non-Batmanites to sit through, but I've been a fan since 1988 and found this to be the most enjoyable Batman film since the first.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|trey parker and matt stone have found a comedy niche for themselves by being as crude, vulgar, offensive and politically incorrect as possible (there are limits of course).this movie is more of the same. but like howard stern before them, they have discovered that there's a limited crossover appeal to this kind of approach. their fans will love this, while most others will be appalled, disgusted, outraged, etcetra. of course that's the whole point. any (coherent) political meaning is purely accidental and secondary to the crude gross out comedy. there's some laughs for the non south park fan but no deep political message or meaning.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|You people got to be kidding me, the way everyone talks about this Avril Lavigne girl, they act as if she actually invented rock, or that she's actually breaking new musical grounds or that she's actually a proffesioanal guitarist. HAHAHA, PLEASE! People actually kiss up to Avril! If you think this is punk, or heavy metal, then somethings wrong. You ovbiously have never heard of REAL rock guitarists like Jimmy Hendrix, Lenny Kravitz, Yngwie Malmsteen, Zakk Wylde, and real contemporary jazz guitarists like Paul Jackson, Norman Brown and Larry Carlton! If you think Avril is rock, you ovbiously never heard of REAL rock bands like Lamb Of God, Slipknot, Rammstein, Decide, Suffocation, Candiria, Machine Head, Pantera, Slayer, Burnt By The Sun, Psyopus, Emperor, Necrophagist, Children Of Bodom, Krisiun, Mudvayne, Trivium, Shadows Fall, and Mastodon! You guys disgust me...running around acting like listening to Avril Lavigne makes you punk or hardcore. Grow up! She's not heavy metal! She's not rock! She's not punk! She's pop-rock, which is not REAL rock. Learn your music genres! REAL Punk is stuff like The Ramones, The Clash, The Virus, and The Casulaties. Avril Lavigne is so commercial, and manufactured. Avril really takes the word \\"Poser\\" to a new level. Because of Avril, you see so many kids ages 11-14 constantly buying her albums and then running around wearing stuff from hot topic trying to skateboard when they can't do something as easy as an ollie. She also needs to learn to act right, too. You don't go around busting and insulting on pop musicians like Hilary Duff and Britney Spears on TV when your own music is under the pop music genre. Wait until your music actually becomes real rock...then you have the right to insult. If you ask me, this Avril Lavinge has alot of growing up to do. Constantly trying to project that \\"I'm bad-ass\\" image, always running aroung saying \\"I'm such a punk, I'm anti-Brtiney\\", I mean grow up. Another thing that makes me mad is Avril Lavigne's fans. Everyone acts like she's the best guitarist and the best musician out there when she isn't you got MUCH better guitarists out there that could really kick Avril's ass with their level of musicianship. Avril is not helping or saving rock music...in fact, she's disgracing rock music. The only reason people are so attracted to this stuff is becuase Avril Lavigne and her band members can play a their instraments and write catchy lyrics with a catchy chorus, with music to dance and jump around to. But that doesn't make it good! It doesn't make it complicated and heavy! Her stuff is easy to play, espaccialy compared to some of the music artists I've listed above! The only reason why she's so famous is because all the little kids buy her albums becuase they're too scared and not ready to check out real rock bands. Why don't you people listen to some REAL musicans and bands for a change and stop eating everything that MTV, the radio, and music companies shove down your throats all the time.ne's fans.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I figured...well, there are already over 1300 reviews here and I'm just adding another 5 star rating, so it won't do much. There's not much I can say that others haven't already said, but I just wanted to say this: <br /> <br />WOW!  <br /> <br />I cannot believe that almost two years after being released onto DVD that this is back on the top 100 list - and under the top 25, beating out many new releases that you'd think you be rated in the top 10. This little show that Fox thought couldn't is really causing a storm and creating so much buzz. As a long time Browncoat, since the initial airing, I cannot believe that this show has come this far here and done so well.  <br /> <br />Everyone, start getting excited for the movie - after seeing an advance screening, I am only that much more excited for the final release and promotion of the BDM. If you haven't already - get the box set, another for yourself, for your friends, family, coworkers, strangers on the street, etc. Spread the word - Firefly ROCKS!
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is the kind of album that has to grow on you. You have to give it a little time and be patient. Coldplay isn't about manufactured jingles. You need an open ear and an open mind to really appreciate their talent. This isn't sugar Pop. It's got big arrangements and big ideas. \\"X&Y\\" ultimately succeeds because it wants to be something.
B000002OVJ|5.0|I cannot get enough of this album. Its so raw and classic in every way. I'm sure this album was brilliant when it was released with only six songs. But this 14 song version is classic. <br /> <br />The album starts off with \\"Heaven and Hell\\", a brilliant song by  great underrated songwriter John Entwhistle. I cannot get enough of his dark humour and wit. The studio version can be found on \\"Who's Missing\\" <br /> <br />It then goes straight into their first single as the Who \\"I Can't Explain\\". This song is a classic and is made even better recorded live. <br /> <br />After a brief chat with the audience, The Who go into \\"Fortune Teller\\" which is a clever song with some funny lyrics. This song was previously done by the Rolling Stones, another classic band. <br /> <br />\\"Tattoo\\" follows right after. Another song with funny lyrics about to brothers talking about \\"what makes a man a man\\" after which they get tattoos. This was written and is featured on the highly underrated \\"The Who Sell Out\\". <br /> <br />\\"Young Man Blues\\" is next on the list. Written by a \\"young\\" Mose Alison, \\"Young Man Blues\\" is a brilliant and angst-ridden representation of the Who in their mod days and shows what kind of music influence this classic band. <br /> <br />Next comes a trio of some their famous 60's hits. <br /> <br />The first of this is \\"Substitute\\". Despite being shorter than the original version, it is still well done. What stands on this track for me is John Entwhistle's bass line. I don't why, it just does. <br /> <br />\\"Substitute\\" is then followed by \\"Happy Jack\\". Another great examples of Pete Townshend's clever and witty lyrics. <br /> <br />This is then followed by \\"I'm a Boy\\". I find this song very funny. I feel pity for the cross-dressing boy. This song is, like everything on this album, really well done. <br /> <br />After a detailed and funny setup, the band starts up with one of my personal favourites, \\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\". I love the story of this song, the harmony in the beginning, the excellent lyrics and great playing from Entwhistle, Moon, and Townshend. <br /> <br />This is then followed by \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks\\" from the \\"Tommy\\" Opera which they performed. I especially love the \\"Sparks\\" half of the song. That bass playing is killer, Keith Moon is great on drums like always and Pete just rips it on his guitar. <br /> <br />The concert then continues with the cover of the Eddie Cochran classic \\"Summertime Blues\\". This song is so raw and enjoyable. John Entwhistle's deep vocal interlude tops the performance. <br /> <br />\\"Shakin' All Over\\" then follows. The guitar segment in between vocals is absolutely amazing and the song is great as well. <br /> <br />After \\"Shakin' All Over\\" comes the 15 minute version of the Who classic \\"My Generation\\". During the guitar solo, Pete just throws everything in there. Bits of \\"See Me, Feel Me\\", some blues, R&B are thrown in there as well. Pete just does whatever he wants here. <br /> <br />Then, the CD ends with a doubled length version of the great \\"Magic Bus\\". The songs starts off fairly easy then gets loud and titanic. It almost seems like they don't want to stop. <br /> <br />This album is worth the price. However, if you can afford it, I recommend getting the deluxe edition which feature the performance of the \\"Tommy\\" rock opera. <br /> <br />You will not regret buying any version of this awesome live album by one the greatest bands ever.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|If Rocky was the movie that introduced the world to Sylvester Stallone, Rambo is the movie that sealed his fate as an international superstar. Rambo, to me is by far the greatest action hero that Hollywood has conjured. He is brutal, yet his pains are caused by torments from the Vietnam War. Where Rocky was good until Rocky 2, the whole Rambo series was really fun for me. First, a brief introduction to the movies.    In Rambo: First Blood, we see John Rambo, a Vietnam war vet trying to live a civilian life. At the time, many of United States' soldiers who fought in the war were considered evil and heartless. Many citizens felt that the war was unnecessary, that it was not our fight. We see Rambo go to a quiet town to grab a bite, but is pushed around by the local police. When in prison, he is bullied by officers of the law, Rambo starts to have delusions about his time in Vietnam and he makes his move. He attacks the officers and escapes into a jungle. The story ensues...    In Rambo: First Blood Part II, Rambo is doing time in prison. He is called by his friend, Col. Trautman to go on a mission. To scour the enemy camp in Vietnam to make sure there are no P.O.W's held in captivity. It is supposed to be a basic mission that involves no hostility but of course, Rambo takes things into his own hands and things go awry.    In Rambo: Part III, Rambo is approached by Col. Trautman to accompany him and a number of his men to infiltrate the Russian camp in Afghanistan. The U.S. was on friendly terms with the Afghan people and they provided them with weapons and other services to ensure their freedom from the Russians. As expected, things go bad for Col. Trautman and he is held prisoner in the Russian camp by some really nasty dudes. Rambo, being the noble guy that he is, goes to Afghan to do a whole lot of a$$-kicking to save Col. Trautman.    What makes the whole Rambo series highly entertaining is Sylvester Stallone, there's no doubt about it. The stories are predictablebut they are executed so well, it's just a whole lot of fun. The thing that has made me always prefer Sly to Arny is that Stallone's movies have emotion. You feel for the characters he plays. When you see Rambo and the things he goes through, your heart really goes out for the guy. You then realize, he's not just some macho bad-a$$...he's a guy trying to escape his past, he wants something better for himself but his past always catches up to him. And many times, the situation calls for it and not vice versa. And the fact that this guy very skillfully plans his attacks and devices a gameplan makes the movie that much better. It's not all brawn and no brain. Richard Crenna's character, Col. Trautman is nothing to shout about. He has a fatherly figure in the Rambo series, someone that Rambo trusts and can always count on. He also usually threatens enemies about how dangerous Rambo is, how he's going to kill anyone that gets in the way, etc...I'm sure you get the picture, but it's still a pretty decent character.    In short, you've got to get this DVD set. Rambo is one of those classic movies, not only in terms of action but in it's spirit and gusto. I am mesmerized everytime I watch it. To end my review, I would like to quote one of my favourite lines from the movie.     Col. Trautman: The war, the whole conflict may have been wrong but damn it don't hate your country for it.   Rambo: Hate? I'd die for it.  Col. Trautman: Then what is it that you want?  Rambo: I want, what they want, and every other guy who came over here and spilled his guts and gave everything he had, wants! For our country to love us as much as we love it! That's what I want!    Folks, this is a must-buy. Highly recommended!
B000002OX7|5.0|28th...How can anyone think that Who's Next, by far the best Who album, rate that low out of 500? This album should have been top 5 at least unlike some other albums *cough* Pet Sounds *cough*.  <br /> <br />This was the first non-compilation Who CD I bought and I fell in love with the first time through it. Most of the songs are leftovers from the aborted rock opera \\"Lifehouse\\". From the unforgettable synthesier-driven \\"Baba O'Reilly\\" to the angst-ridden Roger Daltrey scream in \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", Who's Next is bar none a classic.  <br /> <br />The album starts off with the teenage anthem \\"Baba O'Reilly\\" or as some ignorant people I know call it \\"Teenage Wasteland\\". It's five minutes of pure synthesizing goodness and, for some strange reason I have yet to decipher, is omitted from most of their greatest hits collections. <br /> <br />Next is \\"Bargain\\", a Baba Meher inspired classic. Not a personal favourite, although it is an alright song and its seems to sit well with most people so I won't argue against it. <br /> <br />Third is \\"Love Ain't for Keepin'\\". Interesting little ditty. Not one of Pete's best but fine nonetheless.  <br /> <br />The only John Entwhistle contribution on this album is the fourth track \\"My Wife\\". This has some of John's most witty, clever and funny lyrics since \\"Boris the Spider\\". His dark humour is unique and brilliant and is an underated songwriter. <br /> <br />To end the first side (if you listened to this album in 1971) is \\"The Song is Over\\". It's a good song with great piano and superb singing from Daltrey and Townshend. Do I hear a bit of \\"Pure and Easy\\" near the end of the track???? <br /> <br />Next is \\"Gettin' In Tune\\". Almost seems like Pete is writing about his songwriting career. He was definitely in tune at this point of his career. <br /> <br />\\"Goin' Mobile\\" is an underrated Who song that I don't hear much of. I find this song motivating and a bit rebellious. \\"Watch the police and the tax man miss me\\" He's stickin it to the man!!! (I apoligize for going hippy on you fans) <br /> <br />\\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" what a sweet little tune, nice and soft and easy, seems a bit angry but its still...WHOA!!! Did not expect that. Don't let the first couple minutes of this song fool you, its a real rocker in diguise. The song starts off nice and a few hints of rage and insanity then out of nowhere it really picks up. By far a classic track. <br /> <br />Here we are the end of the original album \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\". Eight and a half minutes of pure rock. Rebellious lyrics, loud guitar, maniacal drums, steady bass, amazing singing and a wonderful backing synthesizer, this song has it all. You cannot help but turn this song up full blast. And it ends with Roger Daltrey's primal scream. Classic. <br /> <br />Now as for the rest of the remake with extra tracks, I cannot tell you much except that \\"Pure and Easy\\" and \\"Water\\" are excellent and solid tracks. I will get this version and listen to it. <br /> <br />Do not overlook this CD like RS 500. Experience that magic that was THE WHO!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Most of the other reviews clearly state the reasons to buy this DVD - it is easily their best effort, with 30 songs to play with. There is one thing that has not been mentioned that makes this worthy of purchase - the editing. The performances have been put together with multiple cameras and angles, moving from one performer to the other with ease. You never feel stuck looking at one performance, wanting to see another, and the energy of each is never lost. An excellent job and worth the price. Oh, and by the way, the group does NOT miss Don Felder.
B00006AW2J|5.0|This is a great classic Rolling Stones and classic rock album. There's not really much more to say that hasn't been said already about it in the fan's reviews so I guess I'll give each song a grade of it's own...<br /><br />Rating Rolling Stones - Beggars Banquet<br /><br />Sympathy For the Devil  A+<br /><br />No Expectations  A+<br /><br />Dear Doctor  A<br /><br />Parachute Women  A<br /><br />Jigsaw Puzzle  A+<br /><br />Street Fighting Man  A+<br /><br />Prodigal Son  A<br /><br />Stray Cat Blues  A+<br /><br />Factory Girl  A-<br /><br />Salt of the Earth  A+<br /><br />Jigsaw Puzzle is my favorite song on the album. I tend to like the more unknown songs that most people never heard of. If only this song got radio play. Anywho...
B0000AQVCL|1.0|John Lennon once said that any group that would come after the Beatles would be known as \\"sons of the Beatles\\" because of the impact they had on pop music (of course the Beatles never failed to publicly acknowledge musicians who had influenced them, but make no mistake, the Beatles influenced music, art, fashion and even politics in their time!!) You can see \\"sons of Beatles\\" in many bands just as John had predicted (two examples: U2, Duran Duran if you listen closely enough).  But Jet doesn't give a cr*p and outright STEAL the Beatles and then try to pass it off on the unsuspecting GenY'ers who don't know any better. <br /> <br />Everything from the cover art, to lyrics to riffs...jeez, why don't the just call themselves a glorified Beatles cover band!  I cringed the first time I heard \\"Look what you've done\\" on the radio. MY GOD IT'S SEXY SADIE!! And these Jet poseurs probably don't even know what the original song was all about!!  I can see why the Iggy Pop and the AC/DC fans are also outraged!! <br /> <br />Shame on you Jet!!  If you want to hear original stuff by the world's greatest band ever, get a copy of Revolver and the White Album by the Beatles.  Puts Jet and all the wanna be hip \\"groups\\" to shame!  You'd be surprised at how fresh the songs still sound, 30 years later!!  Don't give this so called  band any more money. <br /> <br />One thing is to be influenced by and the other is to imitate shamelessly and pass it off as your own original work.
B000002KB8|5.0|If there was no Black Sabbath, then where the hell would metal come from. All metal bands today were deeply inspired by Black Sabbath if you like it or not. True some bands of today are heavier and have their own sound going like Korn (I hate Limp Bizcuit, but actually like early Korn), Sepultura (Awesome Brazilian boys), Pantera (Kick ass), Metallica (Another hugely inspirational metal band who shined so much more with their classic 80s albums), System of a Down (Very fun comical metal band at times), but none of them sound as good as the classic Black Sabbath with Ozzy line up...<br /><br />I'm 23 now and I love old music (stones, beatles, zeppelin, floyd, who, dead, ccr, jeff beck, guess who, queen, bowie, young, dylan etc...) I might not be from the 60s or 70s, but that doesn't mean I can't tell that the music then is simply amazing! I like todays music as well.<br /><br />People who don't like old music just because it's old makes me want to vomit...<br /><br />Black Sabbath - Black Sabbath is classic!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Mezmerize is an album that was so highly anticipated, no one thought it could live up to previous albums.  Well, System of a Down has done it gain.  Their unique brand of music will pull you in from start to finish.  From the slow and sad, yet hauntingly good intro of Soldier Side, to the hit single B.Y.O.B, you will be amazed.  From there you will here amazing songs such as Revenga, Violent Pornography, Question, This Cocaine makes me feel like I'm on this song, and Lost in Hollywood.  System of a Down has made a unique brand of music, while keeping their important messages on everyday issues, and this sets them apart from all other bands.  The only downside to Mezmerize is that it is short.  However, Hypnotize is on its way, and I have a feeling it will have plenty more songs. This album is only rivaled by Toxicity, and you will not regret buying it. <br />
B000002UA2|5.0|...but it took me a few more listens a while after I bought untill it really grew on me making me love the album. Childhoods End is the best track on here. This album really moved me and it's really cool to have since it's another Pink Floyd album, and I'm always excited to listen to anything by the band. I tend to listen to it more then most of their albums for some reason. I like more unknown songs and albums by bands I love. Anywho...
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity was the first album I had heard of System of a Down.  Naturally, at first, I was shocked, but it grew on me overnight.  System of a Down is by far THE most original and creative band I have ever heard.   Chop Suey!, A.T.W.A, Toxicity, Science, Aerials, Prison Song, etc......., this album will completely blow you away! Ignore any Parental Advisories on this, or any System of a Down album, because they are full of profound messages that cleary, and sometimes, bluntly, adress real life issues.  Some People think that System of a Down is an unoriginal band.  Some people think they are untalented.  Well, some people are idiots.  Rock on, System of a Down!
B00008EY65|3.0|How many times do you come away from an action movie (and one based on a comic book series no less) remembering the characterizations more than anything else? This was the case for me in watching \\"Hellboy.\\" I was totally impressed with Ron Perlman's dry as vermouth performance,and that alone elevates this film above your standard comic book to screen adaptation. Unfortunately, the story is so uninvolving that it never puts the characters in situations that really engage the viewer,<br /><br />so the acting talent much of the time feels wasted.<br /><br />This film looks great, too, but come on, by now don't all Hollywood action films look pretty good, and shouldn't they, given the amount of money thrown at them. No, the makers of \\"Hellboy\\" have all the ingredients for a spicy, rich, delicious stew but only manage to muster up a mediocre broth that needs a lot of salt.<br /><br />Grade: B-
1573223026|3.0|In his fourth novel, Nick Hornby tackles a very weighty subject; writing a book about suicide ultimately means writing a book about the value of life. In this sense, \\"A Long Way Down\\" starts off with promise, but ultimately ends up feeling rather empty. <br /> <br />The book begins on New Year's Eve, when four very different people meet on a London rooftop, each planning to commit suicide. Instead of going through with their plans, however, they form an unlikely support group of sorts. \\"A Long Way Down\\" follows these four characters as they deal with the reasons behind their suicide attempts as well as the new bonds they form with one another. <br /> <br />The narrative passes between the four main characters, with each relating a consecutive chapter in their story. By designing the narrative in this way, Hornby deals with the difficulties of having four main characters quite well; I felt an intimate attachment to all four without the plot losing a sense of urgency. Indeed, the narrative style is one of the high points of the book. <br /> <br />Overall, though \\"A Long Way Down\\" gets off to a great start, at some point it loses its ability to inspire sympathy in the reader. The main failure of \\"A Long Way Down\\" is the same as in every other Hornby book: the ending just cannot live up to the first three-quarters of the book. Hornby sets up a story that is both innovative and engaging, and addresses perhaps the most interesting questions of his writing career; everything falls flat, however, when he attempts to bring it all together.  <br /> <br />Hornby creates characters that the reader can both understand and identify with; the reasons each character attempts suicide are communicated honestly and with heart, and the characters always seem more than their suicidal tendencies. However, at some point, I began to feel disconnected with the characters; they lost their realness, and seemed to evaporate before my eyes. I know what each character ultimately chooses, but I have no idea why; I can guess, but a large effort is necessary to pin these characters back down and flesh them out again. I cannot say exactly whether this is because Hornby's answers are too trite or too glib; either way, his answers failed to inspire reflection in me. <br /> <br />In short, \\"A Long Way Down\\" is a very entertaining book, but entertainment is ultimately all it has to offer: don't read it expecting insight.

0452286379|5.0|Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" is now more than sixty years old, yet it retains its relevance and urgency, Judging both from fellow reviewers, and from personal experience, every reader of \\"The Fountainhead\\" emerges either loving or hating the book. I personally find Rand's ideas uplifting, and though her philosophy is not entirely of her own creation, Rand's presentation is compelling and her formulation is clear and striking. Furthermore, for all the controversy Rand's philosophy may inspire, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is undeniably an entertaining and well-written book. That Rand is able to demonstrate her fascinating philosophical views in such a well-written and well-told story should be recognized as a tremendous feat. <br /> <br />\\"The Fountainhead\\" tells the story of Howard Roark, a young architect who is, as Rand describes in an early manuscript, \\"a man who is what he should be.\\" Roark is a self-contained human being, who lives entirely for himself-by his own definition of himself. Roark's buildings are considered both radical and offensive by many observers because he fails to pay homage to the styles of the past or to collaborate with anyone on any part of his designs. As Roark states at one point, he believes that buildings, like people, have one central theme or idea, and that idea cannot be compromised. <br /> <br />The leading figure in opposition to Roark is Ellsworth Toohey, an \\"intellectual\\" with a particular specialty in architecture. Rand, in the same early manuscript, describes Toohey as \\"a man who never could be-and knows it.\\" I take delicious delight in every word Toohey speaks; he is one of the most evil characters every created, and there is no doubt he is extraordinarily good at what he does. What Toohey does is attempt to destroy the heroic, self-sufficient men by setting forth as the moral ideal those men who live by everyone else's standards but their own, who are mediocre and could never achieve greatness, and who submit themselves to the collective will. <br /> <br />The conflict between what Roark stands for and what Toohey stands for demonstrates quite clearly Rand's philosophy: in short, she upholds Roark as the ideal. This contrast can also help explain why some readers feel uplifted by Rand's philosophy while others are horrified by it. The heroic in Roark can be inspiring, but also somewhat menacing; Rand is very clear that it is not possible for everyone to achieve the ideal demonstrated by Roark. This runs counter to ideas most Americans have been instilled with since youth: egalitarianism and the accessibility of the American Dream. On this basis, it is easy-as several characters in \\"The Fountainhead\\" do-to dismiss Roark as an egotist and to hold up Toohey's intentions as benevolent and charitable. <br /> <br />As this is a book review, it is not my intention to argue for Rand's positions-though I realize that my admiration for those positions is plainly evident. I mention these conflicting views simply in hopes that readers will approach \\"The Fountainhead\\" more willing to allow their own values and expectations to be challenged, and honestly assess Rand's ideas. This book is able both to entertain and to inspire thought, and any reader should remain open to both.
B000000W5H|3.0|Once you've gotten a good Stones hit anthology (like \\"40 Licks\\") and a couple of the biggest and best CDs they've recorded (like \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Aftermath\\"), you'll want more. \\"Only Rock and Roll\\" is a satisfying CD and a good place to start, and will leave you wanting more.  <br /> <br />Like almost all the Stones' albums, \\"Only Rock and Roll\\" is built around a couple of then-big hits. In this case, it's the title song, which is still a high point of the Stones' live show. There are also some strong supporting songs, like \\"Till The Next Goodbye\\" and \\"If You Really Want to Be My Friend\\" and a faithful cover of \\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\\". There's also plenty of filler in the second half of the CD, and a very weak opening track. However, it's the stronger material that saves the day, and there's enough good songs here to make for a very satisfying CD from the Stones' prime. Like almost all the Stones' best albums, this CD has dated very well - thanks to the band's heavy reliance on Keith Richards and his Chuck Berry-style riffing. <br /> <br />This is blues-based riff rock performed by musicians who truly love the style and have made it their own. It's also amazingly fun, avoiding most of the heavier, nastier themes that are featured in the Stones' classic material. This may not be the best Stones album, but it's one of the most enjoyable.
B000001EL3|4.0|This was the first Kiss I bought and think this is there best> \\"Shout it out loud\\" still holds up today. Love the cover artwork > Kiss was big in 1976 *  buy this an reflect back when word of mouth was the big media coverage.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out and I must say I am far from disappointed. No, it is not OK COMPUTER or KID A or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, and its not supposed to be.  The band considered that idea but then ultimately chose to SLOWLY progress rather than take a giant leap and fall straight on their arse.  Radiohead did it and succeeded.  Pink Floyd did it with the Wall and it sucked.  Why does everyone expect bands these days to completely turn their music inside out with each release?? It took the beatles about six years to develop from the basic SHE LOVES YOU to the insane A DAY IN THE LIFE (from Sgt Peppers); for gods sake this is only Coldplay's third release.  And there are far too many good songs of this album to justify a one star rating; sure it may not be your cup of tea, some may finds its use of 80s style guitar reverb a little too strong, but surely you can appreciate the great songwriting evident on the recording, especially in songs like A MESSAGE, FIX YOU, SWALLOWED IN THE SEA and WHAT IF.  The only song I can really criticise is (surprisingly) the first single SPEED OF SOUND which is like a half-arse version of CLOCKS. The songs TWISTED LOGIC (a homage to radiohead), LOW and WHITE SHADOWS also indicate a new, darker club-orientated direction for the band also.  All in all a better than solid addition to the Coldplay catalogue;  It does not surpass their previous records but it reminds us of what is so great about them.
0765301598|4.0|Admittedly, it's been about twenty years since I read Dune, and I haven't read the first two volumes in this trilogy.  So I don't have the same basis for criticism as some other reviewers.  (Some of whom seem to have a screen saver of the Herbert universe on their minds.)  But I greatly enjoyed this book.  (Or series of tapes, I should say.) I often found myself leaving the car running after I'd arrived at my destination, to hear more.  The worlds were perhaps unimaginative -- no local color, really -- but this is a story about people and machines, not a galactic tour.  But I still found myself drawn into this strange, yet familiar, alternate world.  I don't recall that Dune was THAT much better.  Maybe some of the other reviewers are just burned out.
B00097DX3U|1.0|It is obvious this band is now only in it for the money; it can't be for the music, because it is mediocre at best.  At one point Morello and co made hardhitting music in the form of Rage Against the Machine's first couple of albums, however it seems they have now run out of ideas.  I bought Audioslave's self titled album in 2002 with great anticipation that this new supergorup would live up to expectations, and I am now listening to this copy from a friend.  COCHISE was a catchy single, LIKE A STONE was a change of direction but far from a great song, and all the rest of the songs sounded like Pearl Jam ripoffs.  And its not that I have anything against Chris Cornell: Badmotorfinger and Superunknown are killers of albums, however everything just seems monotonous here, with the exception of the pretty DANDELION.  YOUR TIME HAS COME blatantly recycles the bass lines of BOMBTRACK, COCHISE, and TESTIFY into another snarly, but ultimately unengaging opener (Tim Commerford can you please try something different from now on??). Basically this album has the same problems that the first album does.  THe singer does not blend with the band, the music is uninspired, and the music lacks direction, with the recycling of the same riffs over and over and over and over again. Not a total shocker, but spend your money on something more substantial. Or just ignore me, which ever one. <br /> <br />
B000929AJQ|3.0|On the issue of this album taking 6 years to makes no difference to me. Just because its been that long has nothing to do with how long production actually took.  Also, yes the lyrics are the same context as they always have been and I hope to God that doesnt change.  That is what he does. Dont expect him to start whining about his childhood, girfriends and the like.  Overall, I think this is a decent album, but I didnt like the lack of instrumental solos, I didnt like the lack of sound effects or unexpected crazy stuff.  All of the songs are clear and easy to understand...not really his style.  None of the songs really go together, the are all just songs that stand alone.  You could listen to previous albums all the way through as a journey.  Not this one.  Pretty good just not what I expected.
B00005JNJT|3.0|(3 & 1/2 stars) This picture was a decent enough summer movie, but it failed to fully satisfy.  The main problem was the slow first half; the scenes of Bruce Wayne gradually reaching the point of deciding to become Batman were relatively dull.  There were some great action scenes in the second half, including an exciting chase involving the first Batmobile.  I also like the James-Bondish way Bruce assembles the techno gadgetry that becomes the Batman suit, utility belt, etc.  And it is fun seeing the origins of the Bat Cave, the Bat Signal (in the sky), etc.  The acting is also solid, especially by Bale, Caine, and Freeman.  Howver, I had a problem with the main villain, R'as Al gul.  His motivations made no sense to me.  The secondary villain, Scarecrow, was a little better.  Another problem was that in most of the fight scenes, Wayne/Batman was just a blur - I really couldn't make out much of what was going on.  I could understand the use of the blurry-action style to show Batman's quickness, but it was ineffective for me.  Overall, I left this movie having enjoyed it a lot less than I had expected to.
B000000P17|5.0|I bought this CD eleven years after its release and wasn't disappointed.  It sold poorly when it first came out and has received horrible press ever since, but for me, hearing the old numbers from my favorite band was invigorating.  Duff sings on several songs (New Rose, Attitude, You Can't Put Your Arms ARound a Memory), and Axl displays wonderful range and a variety of voices in his unique way (Since I Don't Have You, Down on the Farm, I Don't Care About You).  A Charles Manson-penned tune appears on the original release, though unmentioned in the liner notes. Highlights of the CD include the groove-driven \\"Black Leather,\\" the anthemic \\"Attitude,\\" and the haunting cover of the Skyliners' \\"Since I Don't Have You.\\" A must have!
B0009IW88A|5.0|This music is excellent....a fine album that does as much to create the tortured soul that is Bruce Wayne, as does the new, revised film. This is Batman as he should have been portrayed right from the start, and this work bears witness to the new era of the Dark Knight. <br />Despite previous reviews, I loved the film, and I love the music. I can only hope these two composers will join forces again to do the obvious sequel justice....Bring on the Joker!
B00097DX3U|5.0|I really like this band.  They have a Zeppelinesque simplicity and artistry.  There's very little distortion with the guitar work and a great depth in their lyrics without sounding contrived.  This album is the rare example of a band's second album being better than the first.  Buy this!
0140284095|5.0|\\"...write about Wodehouse and you tread on hallowed ground. He's a writer people mind about intensely, a writer who, without strong feelings himself, encourages the most vehement reactions.\\" <br />- Robert McCrum <br /> <br /> <br />\\"No library, however humble, is complete without its well-thumbed copy of 'Right Ho, Jeeves,' by P.G. Wodehouse, which contains the immortal scene of Gussie Fink-Nottle, drunk to the gills, presenting the prizes to the delighted scholars of Market Snodsbury Grammar School, built around 1416.\\" <br />-John Le Carre <br /> <br />      An acquaintance of mine who was then recently introduced to Wodehouse, when I was trying to encourage him to embark on the journey of devouring the whole canon, asked me a question that is often put to Plum(Wodehouse was called Plum by those who loved him - he still is) devotees, ''What is your favorite Wodehouse?'' Now, that is what I call a very difficult question to answer. Take the case of someone visiting the Tulip Gardens of Holland being asked about the single flower he liked most among the breathtaking sight of all the flower beds symmetrically laid; wouldn't that someone be baffled to no end? Or like Shakespeare's Othello, be perplex'd in the extreme? I feel very similar when I am faced with the question. :) I love all of the master's works like ''how the male codfish which, suddenly finding itself the parent of three million five hundred thousand little codfish, cheerfully resolves to love them all''. The books have never failed to put a smile on my face in many a dull moment of life caused by the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. <br /> <br />      I think the best way to go about reading Wodehouse - the way I employed to wade through the whole Canon of 100 odd books - is to start at the Jeeves and Wooster series featuring the adventures of the kind hearted blundering upper class British man about town Bertram Wilberforce Wooster and his omniscient, omnipotent, Spinoza reading Gentleman's personal Gentleman, Reginald Jeeves and after that pounce on the Blandings Castle series featuring the absent-minded Peer, Clarence, the 9th Earl of Emsworth at the helm of affairs and his paraphernalia complete with his hat trick medal winning Berkshire sow, the Empress of Blandings. There are fourteen of Jeeves and Wooster Novels and an almost equal number of Blandings castle novels. After fraternizing with the above mentioned sterling creations of the master, one should not miss the escapades of Psmith (the P is psilent as in Pterodactyl), Uncle Fred and a lot more of other interesting creations. Before I proceed further, there is more to be said about Uncle Fred. He is a peer mostly confined to the country side and on the occasions he is unleashed on London, those being the occasions when his better four-fifths is away visiting friends or on some other errand that keeps the redoubtable Uncle Fred away from her temporarily, he tends to ''step high, wide and plentiful''. I do not know if you are familiar with the word ''excesses'', but these are what Uncle Fred invariably commits when at liberty. <br /> <br />      Steering back to the res, I wonder where else one would come across characters with names like Hildebrand Spencer Poynt de Burgh John Hannasyde Coombe-Crombie or say, Frederick Altamont Cornwallis Twistleton. Douglas Adams may be, yes!! But with all the credit that he is due, Mr. Adams is still not Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse. (Hazarding the possibility of getting didactical, I have to mention that the name is pronounced Wood-house as opposed to the popular notion Woad-house, for I every once in a while chance upon people referring the master as Woad-house) And those of the readers who start out on reading Wodehouse find themselves in a similar enviable posish of a sailing master pleased as a punch upon discovering a great chunk of land. In other words, they would feel like how Columbus would have felt when he first set foot onAmerica. <br /> <br />      The plot in the books generally is very intricate and enters into sub-plots and sub-sub-plots like the nested parenthesis in a complex algebraic expression and finally ends with almost none of the characters disappointed; but for me, the plot itself is incidental. It is like a rope that holds the pearls and diamonds of the master's free flowing lyrical prose replete with hilarious adjectives to describe characters and situations, Gilbertian metaphors, allusions to Shakespeare, the holy scriptures, references to the Greek and Roman Myths, the Arthurian Legend, the poems of yore and all this is done in a humorous manner that leaves you guffawing to no end. It is these things that have sent me back to the master again and again and yet again. Here I have to add a note of caution. It is not advisable to read Wodehouse in public places lest you would be considered leaky in the top floor by your suspicious and shifty-eyed onlookers. <br /> <br />      I highly recommend PG Wodehouse to anyone who loves the English language. I myself call the favorite pastime of reading his books, `Gorging on Plums'. Not for nothing, I guess, does a friend of mine call me a `Wodehouse Crusader'.
B00005JNJT|5.0|As a long time fan of Batman I have longed to see a big screen Batman that displayed the depth and power of the character I had come to enjoy while reading: Batman: Year One, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: The Long Halloween, Batman: The Killing Joke. <br /> <br />I longed for a Batman movie where Batman was not overshadowed by the villians he fights. When I first heard about this movie I almost screamed in pain, expecting another Joel Schuemacher insult to Batman. A movie that had more in common with the campy Adam West series of the 60's then the character I had come to enjoy in the comic books. <br /> <br />Walking in with no expectations I was blown away by what I saw. Here was a movie that not only reached the dark, film noir levels of Tim Burton's original Batman, but reached even farther. I could almost see flashes of Frank Miller in the script with I'm sure fans of Batman: Year One will recognize and enjoy.  <br /> <br />I know some people don't like how the fight scenes were shot in this film, but I think they were perfect. You don't get to see all of Batman's style, but it makes the fights seem more real. Like you are there trying to follow a real fight between Batman and the thugs of Gothman's underworld. It highten's the drama, and makes the movie seem less like just another hollywood action film with crisp easy to see fights. If there is a sequel I implore Chris Nolan to leave the fight scenes like he did in this movie. <br /> <br />Batman Begins is filled with great performance from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Nieson, and Gary Oldman. But not even that all-star supporting cast can steal the light from Christian Bale. As Batman he delievers the sharp obessiveness that I had come to look for in Batman. For that is the Key in my mind to Batman, Bruce Wayne died the night his parents died, and in the pain of that night Batman was born.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I was listening to this album in the counseling office trying to help Cartman with his eating disorder, and I couldn't help but listen to this album while he was spilling his emotions, mmmkay.

0375701427|3.0|The reviews of this work might actually be more interesting than the novel itself. <br /> <br />As entertainment, I don't rate the novel very highly. I read it because I like to finish what I started, plus it was the only book I took on my vacation. It would appear that Roth was owed a Pullitzer and they finally got round to  conferring the honor when he produced a sub-par work. Somebody needed to edit this novel and have Roth work a little harder for his money. <br /> <br />I am sure you are aware of the plot details by now. Swede Levov would appear to be a metaphor for 50s America and the ascendance of non-Wasp white immigrants into the middle classes. I think Roth makes an important point about Americans with his obsessively detailed account of the glove industry. As an outsider I can tell you that Americans are notoriously obsessive about their work and can often be quite intellectually developed in that one field yet thoroughly uneducated in any other area. They tend to take one thing to an extreme - a characteristic which can leave them underdeveloped as human beings ( my opinion as an outsider living in the US ). <br /> <br />The lack of depth of the characters may also be a deliberate choice on the part of the author. A Jew and Catholic who have distanced themselves from their cultures in their attempts to reach this materialistic nirvana, becoming hollow facsimiles of the WASPs they envy. First their families abandoned the \\"old country\\", then they abandoned their neighborhoods and closeness to their families for a life among strangers - I think it makes sense. <br /> <br />Bottom line - don't make this your first Roth novel. I think I will read another by him after doing my research and waiting a while until the bad taste has faded.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is very good, mmmkay. When I first put the headphones on my ears, I was like ,\\"Man this is pretty good, mmmkay!!!\\" and then I told everyone to not do drugs because drugs are bad mmmkay. Did you know that Kurt Cobain killed himself with a shotgun while under the influence of heroin, mmmkay? That's why you shouldn't do drugs, because drugs are bad, mmmkay. <br /> <br />Smells Like Teen Spirit is a great song, mmkay!!!
B00006LI4S|5.0|My husband and I are ardent Pink Floyd fans; he loves the earlier stuff, I love the later,and we meet in the middle with \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"The Wall\\". We both agree on the talent of David Gilmour. Roger Waters may have been the writer of many of Pink Floyd's hits, but David Gilmour was always the voice. After watching this DVD, I must say that David hasn't lost a thing! His voice is as beautiful as always, there is no loss at all. David's guitar is, as always, beyond excellent. If you loved \\"The Division Bell\\" as I did, you will adore this, for there are several songs from the CD in the concert. This is a must have for all Pink Floyd fans, in my opinion.
0446677450|1.0|Not only is this book unbelievable, it offers advice that is questionable in many regards. My gut feel is that this guy made his money selling books, not in business.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|There's only one thing I can say about this album, it is one of the best I have heard in many many years, and it's most likely the best rock album that will be put out this year. Any rock fans will love this album. If you even remotely liked the FOOs before, you will LOVE them now! The lyrics are amazing, the riffs are catchy and the entire album is tight. HATS OFF TO GROHL AND CO. ! You dont hear new rock like this very often.  <br />
B0000541AM|5.0|5 stars for the movie, but the packaging is woefully skimpy. It is rumored (...) that The Warriors will be released in a Special Collector's Edition in October '05. Can you dig it? CAN ... YOU ... DIG ... IT. Presumably this is to coincide with the 'remake' (bleh) but if that's what it takes to get commentaries and cut scenes, then ok.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|i was very cautious to listen to the new a7x cd, so i decided to listen to it before i made a decision to buy it, and i must say....this cd is damn good. i listened to the whole thing on their website. while there is NO screaming at all (which being a fan of old a7x, i was curious about) but it does not take away from the quality at all. apparently M. Shadows had an operation that caused him to not be able to scream. oh well. the musicianship is AMAZING. i love the 80s metal music. the only band i can compare avenged to is atreyu.....and this cd makes atreyu's \\"the curse\\" nothing but a waste of a cd. the only reason i give this cd a 4 is because i'm not to keen on the song \\"the beast and the harlot\\" <br /> <br />standout tracks include: \\"the wicked end\\" (just listen to the interlude in it to understand its greatness (nightmare before christmas)), \\"MIA\\" (an amazing end track), and \\"strength of the world\\" <br /> <br />p.s. <br />this goes out to the kid who said Avenged were nothing but a hot topic band who rips off from every band out there and who needs stores like hot topic to advertise their horrible cd. <br /> <br />1. the band has nothing to do with advertising. they have marketing and publicists who take care of that stuff. <br />2. the band rips off from every other band out there? well how many other bands in the genre pull off amazing solos and can blend old school punk and old school metal? can you?  <br />3. what do you consider good music? <br />4. this cd deserves such good recognition. it's amazing.
1401301010|3.0|I have never been the worlds biggest Red Hot Chilli Peppers fan. Sure I think they are a good band with some really good records, but I've never felt the need to drive far distances to see them live, collect all their albums or any of the other stuff usually assosated with fandom. But Anthony Keidis' autobiography \\"Scar Tissue\\" interested me for a few different reasons. One, I do enjoy they're later period softer rock music, which for my money is some of the best alterna-pop you're likely to find. Two, I thought he would have some good stories since he was around in both the early eighties hardcore punk scene and the mid-ninties alternative rock boom. And three, in interviews he comes across as a pretty cool guy. <br />So on those fronts I was not dissapointed by \\"Scar Tissue\\". It was a pleasant and good book, full of surprising honesty and compassion even if at times it fails to go too deep below the surface. You learn a lot about his life, but not as much about him as you might like. <br />Now if you're not into what I call \\"junkie\\" books then you should probably stay away from this book. A large portion of the book is devoted to Kiedis' herion addiction which I have to admit was handled about as well as I have ever read. It is a cautionary tale with the typical body count of friends and loss loves, but rather then shaking his finger at himself and those around him, he tells it honestly and doesn't try to make apoligies about his behavior any more so then he needs to. This is refreshing and good. He's saying not to use drugs mind you; he's just going to tell you how it really is. <br />At times the book is written with a somewhat pedestrian writting style, but for the most part I sensed it came from Kiedis and not his co-author. It has, at it's best times, a conversational vibe that makes reading it that much enjoyable. <br />So I really liked the book, so why do I only give it three stars? Well, because there is a drastic rating inflation on this site. To me, a five star anything means the thing is flawless, four means it's in the top of it's league but not perfect, three means it's good but I've read/ seen/ heard better, two means it bathes in it's mediocrity, and one means that it's godawful horse manure. And Kiedis' book fits the three to a T. It's a good book, I enjoyed reading it. It's not one of the best books I've ever read, nor is it one of the worst. It's a good book that I'm pretty sure if you're interested in you'll dig. <br />And what more can you ask for?
B000067G3C|5.0|Having just watched Speed again this weekend, I felt moved to write a review on why I still love this movie as much as the first time I saw it.  Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves have terrific chemistry on screen, but the movie itself is just one big action sequence.  It keeps you on the edge of your toes, never quite knowing what will happen next (really, does anyone expect the house to blow up?).  Reeves' character is the stuff action heros are made of, confident and yet once in a while reminds you he's human when he suffers.  Bullock's character is quirky and fun, and one heck of a bus driver.<br /><br />It's one of those movies that you can watch to the end and hit play again immediately to rewatch.  Just plain good fun.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|I gave this a try based on Spin's rave and the fact that I think a similar band, the Arcade Fire, is swell. At first listen, I thought the National was a bit repetitive, a little too emo, and kinda like a Smith's rip off band.  <br /> <br />Boy, was I  really, really wrong. <br /> <br />This band's ballads rock, and its rock songs possess an emotional urgency that you usually only see in ballads. I wouldn't call this emo, but maybe urgent chamber pop? Baroque rock? Whatever the National is doing, it's producing music that seems almost like fine literature....addictive, lush, loaded with smart, grown-up lyrics. It's as good as the Arcade Fire if not better. <br /> <br />Much has been made of lead singer Matt Berninger's baritone, comparing it to the growls of Morrissey or Nick Cave. It's an apt description, but Berninger also channels the dude from Crash Test Dummies and even early Bono (before he turned into an Ipod monster with mediocre, over-orchestrated songs). Berninger sings in an ironic tone without being morose. He's wry and heartbroken without being snarky a la the band Cake.  <br /> <br />His band is held together by tight drumming, ever-changing guitars, spiraling violens and some very effective background chanting choruses. <br /> <br />There isn't a bad song on this record, but the opening track,\\" Secret Meeting\\" shines by managing to sound like a cross between Roxy Music and the Clash, a kind of rich, moody rock anthem. Softer songs, including the funny  \\"Looking for Astronauts\\" and the sad, elegiac \\"Daughters of the SoHo Riots,\\" are be good ballads without being sappy, crappy Air Supply or Dashboard Confessional drek.  <br /> <br />I really can't recommend this album enough. It's unusual, lovely and I can't wait to see what they come up with next. <br /> <br />
B00005JNJT|4.0|I think it's obvious by now that the majority of Batman fans are declaring \\"Batman Begins\\" as the best film in the franchise. I'll second that. Tim Burton's first 2 Batman films were good in their own right, but oftentimes too twisted and bizarre. And I won't even comment on the piles of excrement that were \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman and Robin.\\" But Christopher Nolan has awaken this franchise from the coma it was in with \\"Batman Begins.\\" His vision of Batman, Gotham City, atmosphere, etc. is what we've all been waiting for. I knew very little about Christian Bale prior to seeing this movie, but I thought he did a fantastic job as Batman, while playing the superhero as well as playing Bruce Wayne. All of the supporting cast were impressive as well although Morgan Freeman was rather underused. <br /> <br />But despite my high praise for this movie, I did have an issue with something, which bothered me enough to knock off a star from my review...no memorable villains. The majority of the bad guys in this movie are either corrupt crime bosses or average-citizen slimy thugs. This is a Batman film after all...we want to see villains with novelty superpowers, powers that equal those of Batman. Powers that will challenge Batman. Unfortunately, Batman is able to get rid of all villains (or should I say, thugs) in this movie way too easily. Most of them don't even put up a fight! The only somewhat-memorable villain is of course The Scarecrow, and his character is definitely cool. The special effects used in his fright scenes were magnificent. However, he is given very little screen time. I also found his character highly under-developed and one-dimensional. He is gotten rid of too easily, and Batman isn't even the one who does it. We also have Batman's former trainer (Liam Neeson) showing up at a later point in the movie and becoming a villain, but that doesn't go anywhere other than an obligatory fight sequence that's uninspiring. I really think this movie short-changed usin the villain department. But I have high hopes for the sequel, now that we know that The Joker will be making his appearance. <br /> <br />But I will reiterate that \\"Batman Begins\\" is an all-around awesome movie. The PG-13 rating is very appropriate; the kiddies will probably be scared by many scenes. And this movie is LOUD. Then again, that's one of the thrills of seeing it on the big screen. All in all, a great film.
B00005JNJT|4.0|First off, I'll tell you that I saw \\"Batman Begins\\" on an IMAX screen in NYC, my hometown.  I mention this because maybe the film would get a different reaction had I saw it on a \\"regular\\" movie screen, although I doubt it.  I believe I'd love this film even on a crappy 13\\" B&W TV with mono sound.  Nevertheless, the fact that I \\"experienced\\" it in what I suppose are State of the Art conditions certainly didn't hurt.  I won't spend much time with plot recaps, since I figure that unless you've been living in the Batcave for a while, you know well enough what it is we're discussing.<br /><br />Since the last Bat-movie, \\"Batman & Robin,\\" which I believe qualifies as the worst movie ever made, I actually hoped never to hear from Gotham City's favorite facsist vigilante ever again, but then I read that the director would be Christopher Nolan, whose \\"Memento\\" was an astounding mindbender of a noir, I allowed myself to hope.  My hope is confirmed big-time by this film, which burns the previous franchise to the ground and gets us back to basics, telling the story of just how poor little orphaned billionaire Bruce Wayne got in the habit of dressing like a nocturnal flying rodent and fighting crime in the first place, concentrating on his training.  Somewhere in mountainous Asia (Nepal, maybe?) he joins a mysterious group called the League of Shadows, led by the really mysterious Ra'as Al Ghul, played by Ken Watanabe.  He trains as a ninja with Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) then splits when he finds out he must commit a murder to officially enter (I guess a simple fee wouldn't do).  Back in Gotham, Bruce comes up with a really kick-butt fashion statement...and you can guess the rest.<br /><br />Nolan's vision for the veteran comic book crusader would work even if you had never before heard of \\"Batman\\" or known any of the accumulated mythologies.  This is a dark, gritty tale of a PERSON who becomes a crime fighter and not the other way around.  We get a real idea of who this Bruce Wayne is, and that's where our sympathies lie.  His obsessive need to control his childhood traumas and the external forces he believes caused them are what drives this story instead of gaudy action sequences.  Of course there's no shortage of that either; a car chase across the city proves especially effective and the fight scenes have the grace and speed of the finest Asian martial arts movies.  If I must nitpick, the climactic action sequence features editing that is so fractured and rapid that it's like watching the trailer; it's almost incomprehensible.<br /><br />Then there are the performances.  Christian Bale, who lost more than 60 pounds just for his role in \\"The Machinist,\\" has buffed up physically but stays wounded and bruised psychically.  This is one messed up superhero; he can't connect with anybody unless it's on his terms.  The real star of the show for me, though, is Michael Caine as loyal butler Alfred, whose class, dry humor and Cockney accent let him steal every scene he's in.  Morgan Freeman, who gets the most laughs but also the most respect as Wayne's tech guru proves that he could play Q in the next Bond flick, if they were smart enough to cast him.  Katie Holmes, a.k.a the Bride of Cruise, can't escape her basic sweetness but is tough enough to play Gotham's last honest District Attorney.<br /><br />Now a few notes on IMAX.  If you haven't seen the film yet, and live in an area with an IMAX screen, I heartily reccomend seeing it there.  The picture is enormous but crystal clear and the surround sound is terrific; in a scene where people are chattering in the background, I thought for a second that it was rude people in the audience!  Since IMAX theatres are by nature stadium seating patrons with big hair were no problem.  Best of all: no commercials and only one preview!  True, it costs a couple of bucks more, but it's well worth it.  If only all movies could be shown this way, instead of short documentaries and big Hollywood Blockbusters.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is one Hollywood Blockbuster that deserves your full support, though.  Don't wait for DVD!  (If you do however, I have an idea where you can buy it...)kbusters.   <br /> <br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is one Hollywood Blockbuster that deserves your full support, though.

6302878527|5.0|It surprises a lot of people that I like this movie as much as I do, but not as much as me.  I have owned it for 11 years now, and still find it as intriguing and heartbreaking as I do funny and thought-provoking.  In this 1967 film, we see Audrey Hepburn forego the Givenchy route of glamour in favor of playing Joanna, the long-suffering mate of a selfish and conceited architect named Mark Wallace (Albert Finney).  This movie is not shot in chronological order, but it shows the couple through various stages of their relationship in ways that contrast to certain scenes at different times in their unity.  While this may confuse some people, all you need to know is that Audrey was young, single Joanna traveling with Mark when her hair is long.  When her hair is to her shoulders and she's wearing bangs, they are newlyweds traveling with an American couple all over Europe with their horrible brat Ruthie Bell (\\"I thought you didn't like Joanna, daddy.\\").  She has stylish short hair when she's expecting their daughter Caroline and they're out on their own in the MG, and she has the unflattering bob with the hairband when their marriage is at its worst and she has an affair with David in France.  You know you're up-to-date when she's wearing \\"groovy\\" mod 60's styles that don't really suit her.  If you look to Albert Finney's character Mark, he never really changes at all in either appearance or attitude.<br /><br />You really wonder throughout the course of this film what can make a woman like Joanna stay for 12 years with a man as selfish and egotistical as Mark, and then you realize that he was that way from the very beginning.  Joanna saw him in a way that he indulged for a while, regardless of the fact that she didn't like him very much at first.  Also, you watch him make funny faces and utilize his charm in a way that makes you understand why she forgave his philandering.  You also understand what made her decide to humiliate him with an affair of her own.<br /><br />Two For the Road is a wonderful portrayal of twelve years in a British couple's marriage, but it could be anybody on this planet.  There is all the humor, the romance, failure, betrayal, anger, and undying devotion so many couples encounter in even less time than that.  Underneath it all is Henry Mancini's beautiful musical score to create extra magic to the screenplay that Stanley Donen has brought to effective fruition.  This movie is obviously not for everyone, but I would like to point out its ostentatious merits:  Nobody is perfect, and this movie makes that quite clear in spades.  It all comes down to forgiving and forgetting, then onto renewal.  Will this couple make it as they move to America for a few years after all they've been through already?  I like to think so.  Get it for yourself to draw your own conclusions./>Two For the Road is a wonderful portrayal of twelve years in a British couple's marriage, but it could be anybody on this planet.

The wisdom is extraordinary. Some people may have negative things to say about the author, however, I have noticed that they usually have a personal agenda.  <br />In buying this book, you are buying a fantastic opportunity for personal awakening. Regardless of the author's personal life, the book itself is a goldmine of profound wisdom.  <br />I am pretty selective in what I will review, either positive or negative.

B0007OCG4W|1.0|Clive Owen is disgusting in this movie. They're all disgusting but especially Clive Owen. All that foul language made me cover my ears and beg him to stop. I should have turned the movie off instead of wasting my life on this trash. I rented it because of Julia Roberts. I expected better from her.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Last week Coldplay debuted with 737,000 copies. It's no accident. \\"X&Y\\" is the BEST album of 2005. This album is a classic. I've never heard something quite so subtle, dynamic, and powerful.
B00005JNJT|5.0|It was a great film. A tad long, but I really enjoyed Christian Bale as Batman. His scary voice was cool. I bet he had a sore throat by the time they finished making this film. I can't wait for the next one and see what they do with Joker.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I don't know where Coldplay deviated from their path, but I wish they would revert to their original premise. What began as a truly magnificent band crafting songs with clever hooks and insightful lyrics, as they did on \\"Parachutes\\", has degenerated into adult-contemporary schlock.   <br /> <br />Long gone are the days where Chris Martin's airy delivery sounded like the ghost of Nick Drake, as it did on the likes of \\"Sparks.\\"  Instead it has now all been replaced with one-upsmanship with Bono for overexagerated falsetto seeking to accomplish some sort of grandiose pop opera.  It's garbage.   <br /> <br />The lyrics are no better and are so weak and wussy that they litterally make Dashboard Confessional \\"cry-alongs\\" sound tough.   <br /> <br />I am sad that a band whom I have always held in high regard have been relegated to releasing an album of this low caliber.  Their label, EMI, even had to revise quarterly earnings down to compensate for the delay in the release of \\"X&Y\\".  I certainly hope they have a better pipeline of talent, because records like this will drive them into the ground in short order.
B00005JKDR|4.0|This one is a gem, for sure.  I don't really have much  more to add to the other reviews, except for one thing.  Just make sure you notice that there are NO other languages dubbed on this DVD.  It is ONLY in English, which was disappointing for me, a French and Spanish teacher.  Yes, you can buy the other versions -- separately.  I was very disappointed about this when I purchased this DVD.  (I did not purchase it through Amazon and it was not clear about this on the back of the DVD box when I picked it up in the store.  Hard to believe they would make it only with an English track these days.)
B0007Y08IS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie--so much that I took advantage of Blockbuster's \\"no late fees\\" policy and kept it around for a few or five more days.  Trey and Matt are what Roger Ebert called \\"equal opportunity offenders\\"--they lampoon the neoconservative manichean worldview of good vs. evil and the Hollywood Left via Michael Moore and company.  More attention is given to the left than I expected, but there is some truth in how the F.A.G. confuses their celebrity status for an expertise in international politics and economics.      I thoroughly enjoyed the main character's broadway performance (AIDS!) and the final showdown between Team America and the celebrities.  Team America dispatches the celiberals in a disgusting yet hilarious fashion after they make their escape from Kim Jong-Il's fortress.    To sum things up, this movie was great, but it could have been better.

0441172717|5.0|This is the kind of book that defines Epic.  The story spans generations, but every character has depth and interest.  It is a fascinating read for any science fiction fan, and especially for anyone who has felt that he is - or SHOULD have been - made for greatness.  In particular, this is a book that both men and women of any age will enjoy. <br />One big caveat - DON'T buy the Ace paperback, it's disintegrating.  It's worth buying the hardcover version, anyway.
B00001OH7N|5.0|Bowies third album is also one of the best of his career.  Certainly it's his hardest rocking album due to the guitar pyrotechnics of Mick Ronson and what are essentially the Spiders From Mars minus Trevor Bolder:  Mick \\"Woody\\" Woodmansey on drums, producer Tony Visconti on bass with help from Ralph Mace on synthesizer.<br />On The Man Who Sold The World Bowie ditches the primarily folk flavored material he favored on his first two albums (David Bowie, and Space Oddity) for a more hard rock sound, and the difference is mindblowing. Bowie lets his band cut loose, especially Mick Ronson, and in doing so creates a raw and rocking masterpiece that is as melodic as it is powerful.  As soon as you hear the  album opener, the 8 minute long Width of a Circle, you know TMWSTW is going to be a winner. Mick Ronson really shines on this complex, yet down and dirty song of spirituality and sex, great lyrics from Bowie. And the album continues strongly from there. From the T.Rex like Black Country Rock to the beautiful title song, The Man Who Sold The World is by turns a dark, joyful, and rocking tour de force that contains some of Bowie's best early work. It's solid and strong from the beautiful ballad After All to The Supermen. With TMWSTW Bowie really came into his own as a song writer and surpassed his previous and comparitively weak efforts by diving headfirst into glam rock. This is the album where the seed of the Ziggy Stardust persona first begins to germinate: TMWSTW was followed by Hunky Dory where he pulled back from the hard rock sound of TMWSTW and then his earliest masterpiece Ziggy Stardust which is something of an amalgam of TMWSTW and Hunky Dory. Not to be missed.

630542845X|3.0|Eveybody's different.....especially Jeremy Reed AKA \\"Powder.\\" And he was born with stark-white skin, and no hair on his head. Not even when he's 16 does he have any hair. For 16 years he has been living in his grandparent's cellar. When he is asked to come out, everybody is freaked out by his appearance, and the fact that he can conduct electricity, but not everyone likes him. He is smarter than anyone else around him and it is thought that he is a state of being that nobody will be like for thousands of years. During the film, it is said that there is no classification high enough for Jeremy's knowledge, so like Edward Scissorhands, it must make Powder a \\"freak of nature.\\" He doesn't know what the world is, but he is totally different. Some people in the movie almost think his reactions and his appearance are almost creepy.  <br /> <br /> <br />Mediocre movie, overall.
B000068OCS|5.0|Following the end of this visionary film we are confronted with the following:<br /><br />Ko-yaa-nis-qatsi (from the Hopi language), n.  1.  crazy life.  2.  life in turmoil.  3.  life out of balance.  4.  life disintegrating.  5.  a state of life that calls for another way of living.<br /><br />Director/Producer Godfrey Reggio presented this film in 1983, a production that has more in common with the prophets of the Old Testament than anything else.  Reggio has looked deeply into modern technological society, and he is distressed by what he sees there.  The film is haunted by concepts, by books, by ideas, and at the end of the film he offers some of the intellectual inspirations for the movie.  First and foremost, there is the French protestant lay theologian Jacques Ellul, author of a host of books that reflect on human hubris before God and his Creation.  In an age where we associate evangelical religion with right wing politics, Ellul stands out as a stunning exception.  No one evinces greater religious devotion and genuine Christian humility than does Ellul, yet his study of the scriptures leads him to a conception of humans as called by God to be careful stewards of his creation, not exploiters and defilers of it.  Ellul also is disturbed by the way that modern consumer society, driven by ever-increasing dependence on technology, cuts human beings off from God, nature, and themselves.  Although Reggio cites no one particular work, the most relevant book by Ellul is unquestionably his classic THE TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY.  He also cites the French philosopher and filmmaker Guy Debord, whose own critique of consumer society he famously titled THE SOCIETY OF THE SPECTACLE.<br /><br />The message of the film as taken from these thinkers suggests that we perhaps haven't ended up with quite the kind of world that we would have hoped, that we have in fact ended up with a pretty rotten state of things.  The point is established visually by simple methods:  a beginning section that shows marvelous scenes from unadulterated nature told in a style that underscores the majesty, the serenity, and the balance of nature.  The subsequent and larger portion of the film graphically depicts the frenetic, artificial, and unnatural essence of modern society.  Much of one's reaction to the film will be determined by attitudes one has formed prior to viewing.  During the 1980s, Reagan's notorious Secretary of the Interior James Watt (the same person who stated his conviction that we didn't need to worry much about preserving nature because he believed Jesus would return to earth before his grandchildren died) visited the Indiana Dunes National Seashore on the shore of Lake Michigan.  Instead of looking about and marveling at the massive dunes, he looked at the huge industrial masses visible along the shore in the distance, and praised the vitality of the industry he saw there.  Perhaps others will react similarly to this film, thinking that the depiction of the frayed, nutty nature of urban society is skewed and deceptive.  My own sense is that Reggio, Ellul, and Debord pretty much got things right.  We have somehow created a world that few of us have actually wished for.  On this I think Reggio is unquestionably right.  He offers no suggestions in this film about how to extricate ourselves from the mess we've gotten ourselves into.  He understands that the first step in curing a disease is for the patient to realize that he or she is sick.<br /><br />The importance and influence of this film can hardly be overstated.  A vast number of the images of this film have become part of the visual language of modern cinema.  I would bet that few or no modern cinematographers have failed to study this film.  I remember seeing it when it first came out, being struck by the utter originality of almost every image.  Today, it feels far more familiar, but that is because of all the films that have assimilated his images.<br /><br />The other star of the filmis, of course, Philip Glass.  The score for this film easily goes down as one of Glass's greatest compositions.  In fact, except perhaps for his MUSIC IN TWELVE PARTS, there is no work by Glass that I can more enthusiastically recommend.  The only other two works that I love anywhere nearly as much are EINSTEIN ON THE BEACH and the opera he wrote to replace the soundtrack of Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  Even if the film wasn't a stunning visual masterpiece, I could very strongly recommend this merely to listen to the music.  I'm almost tempted to say that this is the finest soundtrack in the history of film, though I would have to think about that for a bit.  Certainly no soundtrack stands so well on its own.  Just by itself, Glass's score is a masterpiece, but combined with the equally masterful visual images, this is an utterly unique multimedia experience.r of the film is, of course, Philip Glass.

B000005RRF|5.0|Its hard to find an album with only good reviews. <br />You are going to have a hard time finding someone who has heard this record a couple of times and feel unchanged. <br />There is no childhoods end. <br />Enjoy. <br />
0316666343|3.0|I agree that at first this book will be hard to put down because it is written about a subject nobody wants to think about much less face, at first the author's vocabulary is great her visuals take you to realms you had never thought about and then you see an incorrect use of a word and then another and another that you loose your train of thought over it. When you are on the edge of your seat towards the end she takes you to a place that is just well stupid and in my mind irrelevant to the situation. Especially if your in heaven. But because of american ideas we have to throw sex in the mix some how (oh did I say that out loud) But she was raped then murdered from the beginning of the book and at the end of the book she enters a persons body just so she can have the sex she never had with a boy she always wanted, instead of helping her father whom she had been watching in heaven look for her killer she has sex? That seemed so out of context to say the least.   This book has a good start and middle but the ending is so detached lacking any emotion as if the author ran out of ideas and it just falls flat on its face its not worth the energy to read it nor worth forgiving the pit falls as the previous reviewers recommends. I spent all day reading the book and when I got towards the end I was so angry that I had wasted my time.
B000646MNE|5.0|Ultimately the only way to do this ground breaking TV series justice is to see the whole thing. It explored women's desires, needs, modern lives and relationships in a way that had not been tackled before. It almost certainly paved the way for series such as \\"Despearte Housewives\\" and even caused some film genre revision, have you not noticed the increased amount of movies which are now cheifly promoted on the strength of talent of the leading Lady?.<br /><br /> Parker is astute, perky, obessesive and sweet as Carrie, Davies is elegantly uptight as Charloote, Nixon is ballsy, brittle and engagingly hard nosed as Miranda while Cattrall is all guns blazingly ferocious in her approach to life as Samantha.<br /><br /> The men filter in and out and are scrutinised for their worth, prowess and personality in a direct reverse of standard gender roles in TV shows. Some seasons stand out as better than others, Season 5 is criminally short due to Parker's real life pregnancy having to be disguised and the story lines featuring Birishnakov are worthy but he is no actor! The final season which heads inevitably to the end of our time with these fabulous women, is strangely saddening and ethereal at times, notable is the absence of the standard narration by Parker which for me enhances the haunting quality of this final journey. Also Carrie's attempt to live in Paris feels oddly cold and isolating as this great but sometimes pompous city can be in a way that New York would never be, being as crazy and all embracing as it is.<br /><br /> In all a worthy series presided over by 4 very beautiful, interesting and talented actors, I miss them heaps!
0975991477|4.0|[...]Lipton just expands on the truths that any follower of God already knows or should. He does connect the ideas of mind over matter more or less. But I want to address the harsh comments written by either Doctors or scientist. Its blantantly obvious why they down this book acting as if its only what you THINK(meaning any kind of thinking) that will make sure you will stay healthy physically and mentally that is not what Lipton is saying in a general fashion because you have to have the right thinking. [...] lets say you have been told by a parent that you don't deserve anything so you have an on going sub conscious tape that is etched in stone in your mind because you have never rationalized the reasoning for the parent saying it to you so when you are at the finish line of a race and you see that you are winning sub consciously you play that tape in your mind that you don't deserve to win and therefore you stumble just before the finish line and thats what he means when he says we have to rewrite our on going dialogue in our minds of what is true about ourselves and what is the fallacy that has been created in our minds because of something someone has said to us over and over. The reason the pharmaceutical companies don't want this out there is that if you look at lets just say 50% of your television commercials and I am probably under estimating because I don't believe in T.V. either but the ad's are about what kind of drug you need to overcome this ailment or worse a \\"character flaw\\" mind you. There is a drug out there right now being pushed off on parents for the disorder of oppositional defiance disorder which really equates to good old natural teenage rebellion and if your child balks at taking that pill there is another pill for that as well. Lipton points out all the fundamentals that Christians and Jews have known longer than science has been around there is truth and then there is man's truth. Scientist want to push the THEORY of evolution and if you don't believe in that then your basically stupid, but there are so many loopholes in that theory that this review would be ten pages long if I went into that. Science or shall I say man wants to eludes himself to the status of God. Lipton whether he knows it or not just proves over and over that science is not exact until you leave God up to the details.   Your beliefs can be rewritten if you go to psyche-k.com and that he does tell you, you can see where your truth and your fallacies lie which you can then correct your beliefs. We are all created in the image of the one true God which means we can think logicaly and rationally. We can see theories, fallicies and more importantly truth in advertising. [...]Read the book and then decide your own truth.
0767834739|4.0|This movie is more base on the video then the first movie was. I have to say the action is better on the second. The woman name Alice doesn't feel or function like a human. She jumps high dodging the missle shot by the mutanted nemesis. In the end Raccoon City was distroyed in the end in reality theirs no such thing, they shot the movie in Canada. Theirs not much blood in the movie compaired to the first movie and mutant lickers don't look as scary this time. That's why only four stars.
B000060MWU|3.0|First off i have to comment on the quality of this dvd.  Its crap!  I dont know if the film is actually supposed to be as gritty as it looked but some the less its poor picture quality and the audio was impossible to hear the dialogue at times and then the music comes on which blasts the speakers so loud that you have to hold the remote the entire film and adjust the volume though out.  At one point i had my tv completely maxed out and couldnt hear the dialogue and then at another point i had it at the lowest setting ive ever had it because of the music.  Poor sound editing or poor dvd? <br /> <br />Now the film.  If you liked Mulhaland Drive then this is the film for you.  If you liked blue velvet and the elephant man then you can skip this one because aside from the gratuitous Arquet nudity this film had few redeeming qualities.  Bill Pullman was terrible as usual and the rest of the characters arent even worth mentioning.  I like David Lynch and thats why i bought this dvd but this one was just too slow and too empty for me to care about.  If not for having to battle with the volume of this dvd i may have decided to hold my review until i had watched it a second time but i cant bare the annoyance again so that should say it all right there.  Not as bad as some reviewers said (still a Lynch film) but not nearly as good as most of his work.  This seemed thrown together and frankly was boring.
B00005JNJT|5.0|After seeing the last three awful Batman movies I had to be coaxed to see this one.  I was very glad that I went.  This is not only by far the best Batman movie I have seen but the best comic adaptation film outside of the Spiderman movies! <br /> <br />What always bothered me about Batman and my main sticking point with the Michael Keaton film was that he had all this elaborate equipment and this super high-tech batcave and it was never explained how he got it.  Also, you wondered how nobody would be able to figure out who he was, especially the person who built the batmobile in that movie.  Finally, we have a movie that explains everything and does it well. <br /> <br />Also, Batman doesn't appear till more than halfway through the movie and we don't really care.  The character of Bruce Wayne is fascinating and the director did such a good job of telling the murder of Wayne's parents that it was difficult to watch the scene without crying yourself. <br /> <br />Liam Neeson is super in this film as a teacher to a troubled Bruce Wayne, schooling him in Ninjitsu and other fighting arts.  Morgan Freeman is excellent as an employee of Wayne Enterprises who was pushed aside after the senior Wayne was murdered and who is in charge of a lot of R&D military equipment that he provides for Bruce.  And of course Michael Caine makes a super Alfred!  Then there is \\"Sargent\\" Gordon, who seems to be one of the few non-corrupt police officers that Batman immediately identifies as someone he can trust for help. <br /> <br />There are many memorable scenes in the film, especially where Bruce is making his first batarang and designing the Batman suit.  The city looks a lot more realistic than any of the previous films (even though it doesn't look like the Gotham of the comics) as does the bat signal (it appears in the sky distorted, as it should). <br /> <br />I hope the director can do as well with a sequel and not be tempted to go off on the \\"camp\\" road that the other series of Batman films followed.

B00005JN2Z|5.0|It is a Micheal Mann movie, so you can expect great photography, well thought out plot and palpable tension, but the real stand out in this movie for me is Jamie Foxx.  He was able to portray the vunerable taxi driver's anxiety and solitary fear as he drives Tom Cruise's around L.A. killing people.  This is the way to go if you're gonna be a hired killer, don't have to worry about parallel parking and running out of time on those pesky meter parking.  Back to Foxx, he shines in this one.  He's an intelligent, seemingly classically trained actor.  You can't help but feel impress.  Foxx has a comedic face and he is known for comedy but he can also do drama and \\"Collateral\\" is the proof.  He's come a long way from playing \\"LaQueta.\\"  The movie itself is beaurtiful to look at.  Micheal Mann treated Los Angeles at night like an icy blonde, nice to look at with dangerous underpinnings.  For you folks who used to live in L.A., you might get a little homesick.  The plot and the tension is nicely paced and builds to a frantic ending.  Oh, and  Cruise is very convincing as a high priced killer,  although his character could have done without the powderd, gray hair.  It made him look anemic.  The DVD has some nice extras, you see the attention that Mann, Foxx, and Cruise gave to this project and that's why this DVD is so highly recommmended.
B000244FDW|2.0|There's tendency for reviewers here to compare this miniseries version (the 1980 BBC one) of Jane Austen's classic novel with the 1995 A&E miniseries of the same. (Actually, the A&E version was coproduced with the BBC, but for simplicity's sake everybody ignores that. BBC, by the way, has a long history of periodically dramatizing *Pride and Prejudice*, but only these two most recent versions are available on DVD.) If both versions were roughly equally wonderful, one could then recommend both. But, alas, one is as close to a masterpiece as dramatic television ever gets, while the other adds nothing to the original novel -- and begs why but for laziness any viewer should watch it when that viewer could be profitably reading or rereading the novel. <br /> <br />This 1980 BBC version is defended because it's truer to plot and characterization details of the novel. What such defenders don't seem to appreciate is that narrative fiction and film are very different art forms, and that the successful adaptation of ideas from one to another is very much a creative undertaking. Dramatized unimaginatively, Austen's lively character studies and sly comedy of manners become a bloodless soap opera. <br /> <br />Beyond suffering from a much inferior script, this version -- as opposed to its A&E successor -- must've suffered from a paltry budget, which adversely affected all aspects of the production. The cameras are videotape, not the true-to-life film of A&E. The cinematography is static, not animated. The actors are mediocre, not talented. The performances are underrehearsed, not polished. The editing is abrupt, not inviting.  <br /> <br />Conversely, the A&E version richly fleshes out the novel, and has a life of its own. Yes, it takes some liberties with the novel -- because the built-in narrative of a novel can explain things that must be presented as action in a teleplay. If you want the novel, read the novel: one of the very best ever written. If you want to see an almost sublimely marvelous television miniseries which happens to be adapted from that novel, get -- own, because you'll want to see it again and again -- the A&E. <br /> <br />This BBC miniseries is a waste of time to watch not because it's awful, but because it's superfluously mediocre. It's not bad so much as not worthwhile -- not while the original novel and the A&E miniseries beckon. Your time can be so better spent.

B0002DB52M|4.0|I liked the movie, it is very powerfull, very insightfull, very very good. But - man! - it is not about America. <br />I am an expat who lived in America for a long time, and it took me to come to Denmark and to stay here for over a year to realize that the movies is about Denmark.  <br />The whole movie is all about a country ruled by a so called Jante Law (an old set of rules in Denmark that starts with Dare Not Think That You Are Better Than Us). The Danes know this rule very well, and I guess they are the ones to realize this immediatelly that the movie is about their country.  <br />Sometimes it happens to an artist that he thinks that he writes about one thing (in this case - America), and the result is about something different, about something that he knows much better (in this case - Denmark).
1573223026|3.0|Nick Hornby's latest novel is the story of four people from disparate backgrounds who meet on New Year's Eve on top of a high-rise that each is planning to jump off of. They don't jump, obviously, and form a sort of support group dedicated to making sure they all stay alive.... <br /> <br />With the exception of Maureen, who is forlorn after years of caring for a severely retarded child, it's easy to see why these people might want to kill themselves.....nobody likes them because they're incredibly annoying.....Martin (Tv host jailed for sex crime) seems to find it inexplicable that no one likes him....Jess (cabinet minister's daughter) takes out her jealousy over her missing sister with profanity and impulsive behavior, and JJ (failed rocker) is just unhappy. Maureen is a bit more symathetic, but so befuddled by the ways of modern life you'd think she'd come through a time warp.  <br /> <br />IF Hornby is trying to parody the kind of story where everything is resolved with hugs and life lessons, he has succeeded....the only problem is, I could easily imagine 3 out of 4 of these characters poised to jump again next Dec. 31....
B00004U8H4|4.0|An excellent and comprehensive view of a sociopath with Narcissism to the fullest. Not really a dark comedy as many seem to think. Rather it is the audience viewing how pathetic and unintentionally funny sociopaths are. We think it is a dark comedy because we find Patrick to be comical but in reality our comedy is his drama. We are not used to such exaggerations that Patrick feels and thinks but to him it isn't funny, it's a sickness.
B0009IW88A|3.0|All the discussion about both composers' contributions overlooks one question: why did this film need two composers to create its music? Zimmer has worked with others before but all of them were with his company, Media Ventures. Howard is not in that category. And this question relates to what happened to Zimmer on Kingdom of Heaven? He was announced as the composer but in the end Harry Gregson-Williams did it? What's going on with Hans, my favorite composer? <br /> <br />I thought the music here was interesting and occasionally haunting, but it seems to work better within the film as opposed to on a CD.
1592400876|4.0|I picked this book up after seeing the book shoot up the best seller list.  I figured if a book on punctuation could be a number one best seller, then I should probably give it a read; and I am happy to report that I was not disappointed.<br />The author does a great job of writing about punctuation and explaining why certain things (like the missing comma in Two Weeks Notice) drive her batty.  Batty to the point of advocating those legions of punctuation devotees get themselves sets of commas and apostrophes, and enter into the world to rid it of all the bad grammar that is taking place out there.<br />For anyone who has been annoyed to see things spelt incorrectly or witnessed first hand the poor use of grammar that gets put on street signs and advertisement,  this book is definitely up your alley.  And for those of us, like me, who just want a good comical read this book is definitely a must have too.
B000007PSR|4.0|Opel is a collection of unreleased recordings from Syd Barrett, they're either demos, alternate versions or unfinished tracks.  Syd was one strange dude and very unperdictable.  He would wander into the studio and start playing and would quit without warning.  While he was in the studio, the backing members of Soft Machine would hang around and try to play along.  But Syd would change chords or notes so often that it became virtually impossible to keep up with him.  A collection of Syd Barrett's material was released a few years ago and it uses tracks from all three albums, a definitive collection of music world's most eccentric individual.<br /><br />Recommended for psychedelic music fans.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I don't know where to begin!! This is a fabulous album--I never knew that cello could be played like this--I think, that between here at home and at my husband's art gallery, we have listened to this CD at least 50 times, if not more. There is not one track that I do not love! I would love an opportunity to here Yo-Yo Ma play songs from this album in person. We first heard it when a physician friend of ours brought it in; he told us he had one copy for his car, for his house, for his wife's car and for his office; then he brought us one. We bought one for our house, one for a friend's birthday, and one for our parent's anniversary. It has inspired us to check out more of Yo-Yo Ma's albums, and we bought two others, which are just as great. You will not be disappointed!!
B000007R1M|5.0|Man Machine was another album in a series of classic music from one of the innovators of electronic music Kraftwerk.  This album features their theme of Man and<br /><br />machine.  Electronic distorted vocals and thumping digital music using twist knob equipment and manual sythesisers.<br /><br />Another short album but it doesn't matter because you'll be replaying it over and over again.  A lot of Star Wars sound effects are used to great effect on this disc.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00006AW2S|4.0|The Stones got on the ball with this one. This is the first classic Stones album. Here they proved they weren't just a blues band. This one has variety. Mick Jagger is  the center of course, screaming and moaning like only he can. This album just might be the best exampleof his talent. And the rest of the band are solid. Keith Richards rolls the blues and the rhythm of Brian, Bill & Charlie keep it rollin'. <br /> <br />The goodies: <br /> <br />Mercy, Mercy: Classic blues number with a fuzz guitar treatment <br /> <br />The Last Time: Cool guitar lick and great lyrics. This is what 60s singles were made of man. <br /> <br />That's How Strong My Love Is: For a white boy, Mick got that soul! <br /> <br />(I Can't get No) Satisfaction: This is the Stone's biggest hit and best known song. With fuzz tone and pounding drums, its great rocking fun. Overrated but still classic. <br /> <br />The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man: Blues and humor, blues and humor. He's real sharp folks. <br /> <br />Play With Fire: Sinister guitar harpsichord  interplay with great lyrics. <br /> <br />The Spider And The Fly: Paul Butterfield should've been very jealous
B000002GYI|5.0|Computer World is another classic electronic album from Kraftwerk.  All the tracks are excellent.  There's no dogs on this one folks.  The album is short but you'll be replaying it over and over.  Back in the day Kraftwerk made some cool and ground breaking music, before they sold out and remixed their best songs.<br /><br />One of their best discs, highly recommended.
B00008WT5C|5.0|The third U.S. release of AC/DC (or maybe the second, its a long story), Let There Be Rock, stands out in the AC/DC canon. it's is an overall darker and (dare i say) more serious effort. Anfgus and Malcolm have traded in their meaty riffs for a shredded sound that is much more raw. And there's hardly a hint of production, hardly even any echo. And it's their best. No doubt. Bon Scott in all his glory screams and wheezes his best. And Mark and Phil pump that fat rhythm mercilessly. <br /> <br />The title track says it all. It's an epic with Biblical borrowings (\\"let there be light...sound...drums!\\") and three awesome solos. The final solo is one of rock's best guitar moments, expecially on the live version featured on If You Want Blood You've Got It. It's an appreggio filled mound of glry and Angus picks at the end of the fretboard. Classic. \\"Go Down\\" is Bon at his raunchiest, \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" (boasting another cool solo) is all down and out coolness. \\"Bad Boy Boogie\\" is just what it says, a funk fest of angry rock. \\"Problem Child\\" is actually from Dirty Deeds. Again, it's a long story. \\"Overdose,\\" with a guitar lick that would echo into \\"Rock And Roll Damnation,\\" is the most sinister track, with a menacing pace and great solos. \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\" is Bon screaming and stuff. YAY! But the ending is the crown achievement. Every AC/DC fan knows \\"Whole Lotta Rosie,\\" and the story behind it. Bon meets big strong lady...has fun. Yet another super AC/DC blues metal ending. And that's all folks.
B00004BZ16|5.0|Sandinista was the Clash's monumental album (well three to be technicaly correct).  Three platters filled with a lot of experimental music (pop, punk, funk regaee and dub).  While most bands would have kept on repeating themselves until they either cracked under stress or couldn't sell another disc, The Clash soldiered on and continued to<br /><br />produce envelope pushing sounds.<br /><br />The songs on this album are real heavy, musicaly and lyrically.  Many songs about rebels, the down trodden and freedom can be found here.  there's even a disco song (Ivan Meets G.I. Joe) a funk-rap song (The Magnificent Seven) ode to the rebels (Washington Bullets and Rebel Waltz) the down trodden (Somebody Got Murder, Something about England).  There's so much music that it'll take awhile to get through it all. You want to here something different, here it is.  Sadly, this was the beginning of a long downfall for the Clash.  Topper Headon would soon become too strung out on Heroin and is kicked out of the band.  Original drummer<br /><br />Terry Chimes (a.k.a. Tory Crimes) would be brought back for Combat Rock.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0006399FS|1.0|Can somebody please stop these 4 pathetic has-beens from making any more noise. It's way over the edge of tolerance (no pun intended). Leave the path for new talent. You guys had your moment, it wasn't all that bad, but please keep your self dignity and avoid becoming the laughing stock of rock just for the sake of some more $ - in spite of all Mr. Vox's conscience itchings.
B000002OZY|5.0|Tommy (1969) was the Who's second concept album.  The disc was such a huge smash that it forever became synonomous with the band.  The story is about the rise and fall of a new age guru who becomes a phenomenon when he's able to over come a severe disability.  Using his gift and skills he amasses a huge following until his eventual<br /><br />downfall and demise.<br /><br />The music was composed using a french horn, keyboards,<br /><br />guitar, bass and drums (Pete Townshend wanted to keep it simple so he could before it live without having to drag around an orchestra and choir).  The bass playing and drums are all top notch whilst the powerful vocals of Roger Daltry gives the lyrics an added depth.  But the rest of the music from Pete Townshend keeps all of the music  together.<br /><br />Sadly the pressure of having to follow up this album with a sequel or one of it's magnitude drove Pete Townshend to have a nervous breakdown.  Life House was supposed to follow but due to infighting amongst the bandmates and Pete's own problems squashed that idea.  Many of the songs from the aborted project led to the album Who's next.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0001XALTG|4.0|There's nothing in this movie that I correlate with my life. What I had heard about this film was quite different from what I saw in it. What I appreciated about Trainspotting is the truth with which most characters are portrayed.There's no exaggeration used.<br /><br />This film is about a man who's deep into drugs and it's all his life revolves around.It's funny to see the kinds of things he does to get himself off the addiction but always faulters.Heroin is the major drug used in this movie.Exhuberance of youth is one thing that is displayed. I have seen Requiem For A Dream and I certainly don't dig it. Trainspotting isn't as depressive and dark as RFAD.It has it's own moments.The English accent used is quite amusing and difficult to follow but you get the hang of it.<br /><br />I laughed out loud 4 times and cried 0 times.<br /><br />Watch it.
B000002UA0|5.0|Piper at the Gates of Dawn was Pink Floyd's first album.  It also happens to be their best disc (The Final Cut comes in at a close second).  Syd Barrett was the leader and his musical talents are on full display.  The tracks on this disc are full of spacey and whimsical music.  But the music also shows an underlying madness that dwells within the songs.<br /><br />This was the only time that all of the band members were on equal footing and clicking on all cylinders.  Roger Waters contributes on the song writing duties as well.  The final track Bike is a fitting song.  It starts out all whimsical and peppy but it ends on a bizarre and maddening note.<br /><br />There are two types of Pink Floyd listeners, Syd Barrett and Dark Side of the Moon fans.  Piper at the Gates of Dawn is a must for all psychedelic music lovers.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000002952|5.0|I don't understand a single word of spanish nor know much about Cuba/Cuban music (other than that Cuba is the place famous for their cigars). I love some Italian, Spanish, Latin American, Brazilian Bossa Nova and Argentinian Tango music very much.  This new discovery is now added to my collection of best loved \\"foreign\\" music (I'm an English- educated Chinese living on a tiny little island somewhere). <br /> <br />I find some of the songs here most hauntingly and achingly beautiful, especially those about love. The voice, the rhythm, the percussion, orchestration - everything is lush, smooth, intoxicating', moving etc. Gloria Estefan's songs are as beautiful as she is! <br /> <br />I guess music is more universal than we realise and touches people everywhere as we share the same human feelings. Do try this CD out for yourself if you are a romantic at heart... <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002OX5|5.0|Sell Out was the Who's first venture into making a concept<br /><br />album.  The album is about a day in the life of Radio London.  Filled with catchy pop songs, funny adverts and<br /><br />station I.D.s, Pete Townshend and company take you along for a ride into the world of (pirate) radio.  Sadly the concept ends around Rael Parts one and two.  The new remastered disc has extra tracks and adverts fleshing out the disc whilst making the experince complete.  Unlike most concept albums, the focus remains the same through and through.<br /><br />Another great album from The Who.<br /><br />The CD comes with a booklet documenting the history behind the album along with photos and adverts.  Sadly there is no lyric section.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000088DTS|5.0|I first purchased Mistaken Identity, and I believe it remains my favorite of the two, but Born To Try is by far my favorite Delta song of all time. She is.....amazing to say the least.  This CD, as well as Mistaken Identity, are well worth the cost of the import. I questioned buying it at first, but now the price seems trivial for the almost medicinal quality of Delta's amazing voice.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|The Final Cut is a sequel to The Wall and a Roger Waters dominated album.  Picking up were The Wall left off, we follow the world after the second world war until it's demise to a thermonuclear holocaust.  Waters chronicles the events<br /><br />that lead up to the end of the world.  It's also an animal of it's enviroment (The Reganomical world and a Thatcherized Europe).  Many people hated this album because of it's depressing nature.  I happen to enjoy it very much and will continue to do so in the future.<br /><br />The CD comes with a nice glossy booklet filled with lyrics and original artwork.  Highly recommended.
B000000OYQ|3.0|Please note that this sounds nothing like Led Zeppelin, not even the song he does with Robert Plant, but sounding like Zeppelin wasnt the point. I wouldnt call this \\"Bar Music\\" either, because I'd be in a huge state of confusion if I heard this at the local bar. I thought this was disappointing for 2 reasons: 1. Chris Farlow...sure, he was good on Who's To Blame from the Death Wish II soundtrack, but that's it. I think his low notes bend out alot when he carries a tune. Maybe it was the way that the potential blues songs were created, but I just couldn't stand his voice on the songs here on Outrider. and 2: More songs should would be nice. Only 9 songs, I was wondering where the rest were at. Now, on to the highlights. The very first song, Wasting My Time, has a sweet riff that sounds fun every time, Page really did a good job on this song. Liquid Mercury was a rocker that had excellent drums and tempo changes/jumps. Now, Emerald Eyes, I thought, is the best song on here. It's very moody as well as heartfelt. It really does sound like this could pass for a love tune, if added vocals to it. The riff is excellent, and Page's playing is as good as it was 19 years ago (from 1988, that is). This is worth it for the die-hard Jimmy Page fan, for which I am.
B000007MVM|5.0|The Madcap Laughs was the first solo album from the founding member and displaced leader of Pink Floyd Syd Barrett.  The tracks on this disc are wide ranging (Octopus,<br /><br />Dark Globe, etc.) and they all show what a talent Syd was and how too much LSD can really melt your brain.  Acoompanied by his fellow members from Pink Floyd and<br /><br />The Soft Machine, Syd paints a world filled with melancholy sadness and an inner madness that begs for release.  Syd would go back into hiding a emerge a few years later to record a follow up disc that's more polished and radio friendly but filled with the same great material.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0006L16N8|4.0|To give this album a 5 star rating would be presumptuous. First, you have to compare it to their previous releases, Parachutes & A Rush of Blood to the Head.  Both of these albums are deserving of a 5 star rating (Parachutes moreso than A Rush...).  The new album just does not measure up to the old ones.  Coldplay made better music before they were on constant rotation on every radio station in the country and having album release specials on MTV. Stop trying to be the new U2 and go back to being the old Coldplay.
B00004BZ0N|3.0|London Calling was the third album from the Clash.  This time they tried to be different.  The problem I have with this disc that it tries too hard.  Tries to be different and streches too far from the band's musical limits and abilities.  It's also highly overrated.  Whenever people talk about the Clash they always bring up this one, their first sell-out album.<br /><br />Recommended for \\"Combat Rock\\" Clash fans.
B000002KNY|5.0|One of the finest records by the Talking Heads,coming from the best phase of their careers,in which creativity was running wild in the group and their initial chemistry hadn't yet begun to fade towards disintegration.<br /><br />Immortal cuts include the fantastically eerie\\"Air\\",the disillusioned\\"Heaven\\"and the rollicking\\"Cities\\".<br /><br />Much imitated but never bettered.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Originally filmed in 1999 as a TV pilot, \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" was rejected. The next year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters. He did so - and created one of the greatest, most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made. <br /> <br />The film really doesn't have main characters, but if there were main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a perky blonde who's staying in her aunt's apartment while she auditions for parts in movies. She finds Rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita's lost her memory. She has no clue who she is. She takes her name, Rita, from a \\"Gilda\\" poster in the bathroom. So the two set out to discover who Rita really is. <br /> <br />David Lynch has been known for making some weird movies, but this film is the definition of weird. It's bizarre, nightmarish, and absolute indescribable. It's like a dream captured on film. By the 100-minute point, the film has become extremely confusing - but if you've been watching closely, it will make perfect sense. Having watched the movie and then read an article on the Internet pointing out things in the film, I now understand the movie completely. <br /> <br />The acting is very good. Watts is terrific. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director facing problems with the local mob. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores. And the directing - hah! David Lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as ever there was. <br /> <br />Is this your type of film? Well, that depends. You should probably view more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You'll need to be patient with the film, and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues Lynch has left throughout the movie. For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true. <br /> <br />\\"Mulholland Dr.\\" is a masterpiece. It's brilliant, enigmatic, and masterfully filmed. I love it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It's always a little scary when you sit down and try to write a review about a record that everybody seems to have an opinion about. What is especially challenging is trying to sum up that record with your own interpretations. If you write it too well, you come off as a pompous, I-know-everything-about-music jerk, but if you don't write it well enough, you sound like an idiot. So I'll try to do something in between.<br /><br />There seems to be this Coldplay backlash at the moment that I cannot quite understand. Is it because they are too big? Too successful? Too married to Gywneth Paltrow? Seriously, what is it? I personally think there are far worse \\"artists\\" (and I use that term loosely) out there that deserve a backlash. Now, I'm sure that any backlash against Coldplay won't harm their sales at all (unless Chris Martin mentions that they are bigger than Jesus in a future interview), but still it saddens me. A recent review I read of X&Y said that Coldplay's music was for mentally disordered women who suffer from eating disorders, depression, etc. and I said to myself, \\"Thank God...\\" If all artists out there wrote music just for meatheads like that reviewer, I would hate to have ears. Needless to say, later on in the review, this guy said that Coldplay's music was definitely not the type you could play air guitar too. Need I say anymore about this person?<br /><br />I don't know if I like X&Y better than Coldplay's previous albums, but I do know that it is on par with them lyrically and musically. Chris Martin is obviously in a different place in his life right now and most of the songs reflect on the insecurities of relationships, dealing with hurt loved ones, and breaking free from the confines of celebrity.<br /><br />The definite stand-out tracks on the album include the confessional \\"What If\\" and \\"Swallowed In the Sea\\", along with the soaring melodies of \\"Talk\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\". But along with the other Coldplay albums, one track just holds the entire thing together and on X&Y, it's \\"Fix You\\". Anyone who could write this song off as just another gooey ballad must not be able to feel it's true meaning. If you have ever loved somebody so much that you tried to actually \\"fix\\" them when they were in pain, this song will mean something to you. It's hopeful and incredibly poignant each and every time you listen.<br /><br />Many people write Coldplay off as \\"Radiohead-Lite\\" (a comparison I am tired of hearing) or as depressing music, but obviously those people just don't get it. Coldplay's music is not depressing at all...it's just the opposite. Just because a song is slow, does not automatically make it suicidal music. Geez, people. If you really listen to the melodies and Chris Martin's voice, it's hopeful, empowering even.<br /><br />Oh, yeah...the U2 comparisons are getting old, too.tire thing together and on X&Y, it's \\"Fix You\\".

B00000F6LQ|5.0|If you love both satirical comedy and pointless humor, than this is the movie for you.  I personally find it to be completely hilarious, I love every minute of it.  Some of the extras are quite good too, like the little documentary about all the locations used, and the how-to movie about the coconuts.  Watching the movie w/ the comments from John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin was also funny and very insightful.  Overall, a great buy that I don't regret in the least.  The only problem I've had is that it is incredibly difficult to get the disks out of the case w/o fear of breaking them, but once you get them out, its definitely worth the trouble!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki has created a film that places among the best I have ever seen, and I am not limiting my comparison to the anime genre. The director presents the fight of good vs. evil not only through different characters, but also related to the conflict in one of the main characters (Ashitaka). The concept is similar to the one used in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but in this film Ashitaka is still trying to contain the inner demon and prevent it from coming out.<br /><br />Right from the start we are mesmerized by the beautiful colors and animation, with crisp drawings and scenes of bliss. Miyazaki is very crafty in using this tool, together with well-chosen music to depict the mood of each scene. But happiness has an end, and in this case, the small village that was portrayed so lively, is attacked by a demon from the forest. Ashitaka is in place and tries to stop this demon before it reaches the village, being partly successful in his attempt. He gets to destroy the demon before he can kill all of his loved ones, but he also touches it in the process. This means that now he is doomed to be overtaken by the evil spirits and die an awful death.<br /><br />This sense of fatality is not unknown in the epic anime genre, and usually we get to see the main characters go on a quest that is impossible to achieve. This case is not different, and even though the Oracle tells Ashitaka that he cannot change his fate, she mentions that there may be an alternative by going west and facing the calamity of Mikado (evil demon) to lift the curse. So Ashitaka leaves the village knowing he should never return.<br /><br />That is when the classic epic adventure starts, and we go on a journey through a forest full of fantastic creatures, gods and demons. One of these \\"creatures\\" is no other than Princess Mononoke, a young girl whose soul the wolf stole, and who has vowed to kill the wolf's enemy, Lady Eboshi. The relationship that develops between Ashitaka and Mononoke is a complex one, and Miyazaki uses the disturbed nature of these characters masterfully to make the story even more interesting.<br /><br />When you put together a great story, with impeccable animation, appropriate music that complements the action perfectly and a few surprises here and there, the result is a movie that is top notch. Therefore, the only thing left to say is that I highly recommend this film, it is a must see!one, and Miyazaki uses the disturbed nature of these characters masterfully to make the story even more interesting.  <br /> <br />When you put together a great story, with impeccable animation, appropriate music that complements the action perfectly and a few surprises here and there, the result is a movie that is top notch.

068987474X|5.0|This book CHANGED my life. I am 23 and single and have spent the better part of my dating life seeing men that I discovered were \\"just not that into me\\". It really puts in perspective how stupid I've been. I've already passed the book onto 3 girlfriends who all love it too. It's a really quick read (like 1-2 hours for the whole thing) and it is the cheapest therapy EVER! Totally worth it. The chapters are named things like \\"He's just not that into you if he's having sex with someone else\\". You have to be prepared though, that the book is very direct, so you have to be ready to be verbally slapped in the face, but that is exactly what I needed. Every now and then I re-read a chapter to inspire me to give up on the guy I'm waiting to call me.  <br /> <br />Just to see if the book was teaching me the truth, I asked a bunch of my guy friends if they were ever \\"too busy\\" to call a girl. A few of them said yes, but then I reminded them that they later dumped those girls. So I must say that it is true. My favorite line of this book (which I now have memorized) \\"With the invention of cell phones, it's almost impossible NOT to call you. Sometimes I accidentally call people from my pants pocket!\\"  <br /> <br />If you are female, single, in a relationship, or even married, you need to read this book.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I don't think you understand how great an album TEOM really is! Mariah had me as a fan but she is on another level with this record. Mariah has made me applaud her return to the spotlight and her vocals are on point. <br />Critics were saying her vocals before had been reduced to whispers and i didn't understand (I only bought Rainbow and Charmbracelet)... until I bought this CD! I can't stop playing this. My grandparents hear this Cd and wonder who is this girl? <br />Its Like that-single. Enough said <br />We Belong Together- 16th #1 single and solidifying her return as diva! I think everyone's heard it by now at least. <br />Shake it off- A spunky and sassy song about a cheating boyfriend which Mariah is leaving with class <br />Mine Again- One of my favorites! This is her best song vocally and she really makes you feel the pain at yearning for a past love. <br />Say Something- w/ Snoop and Neptunes produced. The song is unique and takes a little while to feel but its funky! <br />Stay the night- Kanye produced standout! With an old school feel (sampled by somebody) and has Mariah belting... always a plus about wanting her lover to stay and making up excuses about why to stay! <br />Get your number- Very sexy and funky. A club record which Mariah raps sorta.  <br />One and Only- Twista spits fire and this is a dark and sexy record. Hott <br />Circles- An old school soul ballad that is vocally off the charts! About seeing an ex and pretending your okay. <br />Your girl-Excellent.. too short! Mariah saying I wish I was your girl <br />I wish you knew- Cool opening sound like Alicia.. anyway, its very soulful, sound live <br />To the Floor- Club record with Nelly <br />Joy Ride- One of my favs about being in love.. vocally stunning <br />Fly Like a Bird- A spiritural but modern song about finding peace in God. Mariah sounds awesome and actually has her pastor and choir in the song. <br />MAriah deserves Grammy's not Grammy for her work! There is not one song on hereI dislike! This will be remebered as a classic years from now! <br />The only problem I have here is I wish they were more songs! Mariah take your a$$ back to the studio and record a follow up! <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was one of the people who loved Dark Angel. Fox in their infinite wisdom rescheduled that show to its death apparently to make room for this new sci-fi series by the creator of Buffy. So I was a bit put off by this \\"Firefly\\" show replacing one of my favorite programs at the time. I'm still a sci-fi fan so I watched Firefly. By the end of that premier episode (which ironically wasn't the first episode... more of Fox's infinite wisdom) I realize I'm looking at an innovative and well presented program. I still miss Dark Angel and wished it had a longer lifespan, but I in no way fault Joss Whedon and his excellent show Firefly for that.  <br /> <br />Firefly is a beautiful blend of old west and outer space. Sounds strange, right? Well take it from me. The concept works. It works better than it might sound outright. The reason it works is because of two things: The backdrop universe they created and the well-written stories in front of it. The back-story is rich with history and this show takes a life of its own because of it. When the program is over you really get the feel that these people in this futuristic/western society is going. Kudos to Joss for sticking strong with that continuity.  <br /> <br />The writing for this show is nothing short of excellent and reaches the level of gifted more than once. I think what really makes the show fresh is that you can never really know what the characters will do next. You know their disposition and who they are, but just about every episode has some scene where someone does something unexpected yet still in character. After seeing tons of shows where people actions are so predictable you wonder why you bother watching Firely gives you that extra effort.  <br /> <br />This is not a family show in case some of you are thinking Firefly is Star Wars-esque. Every episode has elements of violence and sexual situations at one level or another. At the same time the complicated moral delimas the characters deal with can be considered a good thing for a thinking teen to watch. While Firefly isn't a \\"parents strongly cautioned\\" kind of show I would assume it a PG-13 (TV-14, whatever) if you are screening for your kids.  <br /> <br />The DVD set is a must buy. Not only do you get every episode that aired, but also episodes that didn't. The ones we missed are well worth seeing. Actually some of the best episodes can be found there. The documentaries are pretty cool too. The production method is a bit different than what most television producers would decide, and I think that makes a difference. There is an outtakes or blooper reel in the DVD too. It's not that amazing, but you get a chance to see the actors have a bit of fun. The other extras are short, but nice enough. Nothing I would consider dead weight. Haven't heard the commentiary. When I do I'll update the review.  <br /> <br />Considering the price and the quality of the show this DVD set is a steal. The DVD quality is top notch too (sharp picture, crisp and clear audio). If you are a sci-fi fan and missed this show you REALLY need to check this out. It's top notch storytelling with top notch effects, sets and acting. Fox has never been good with their sci-fi shows. Only X-Files got proper treatment from them in spite of the fact they had some other high quality programs (which were all treated like dirt). Firefly should have had a longer lifespan. Maybe with the Serenity movie and the Sci-Fi Channel's interest there will be more to see in the future. Here's hoping.
B000002MTR|5.0|Although its no BSSM its still one of my favoutite albums. The music is great, but its not what we have come to expect from the RHCPs. This album is more rocky but it still isnt mainsteam music by far. My favoutite track has to be \\"My Friends\\" because its such a nice song. 2nd would have to be \\"Aeroplane\\" as the bass in it is sooo funky. Next would be \\"Pea\\" as it makes me laugh. \\"Transcending\\", which was dedicated to River Pheonix, who was one of Flea's best friends, is also a good song. Also I would like to give Flea extra credit because his bass playing really excells in this album. I suggest you buy it. NOW!
B0006L16N8|3.0|After the first couple of listens, I couldn't put my finger on it, but something was not quite right with this album.  There seems to be some good, solid songs here, along with some that are maybe a bit sub-par for Coldplay. And then it hit me: it's the album's pacing that is off. The track order couldn't be more wrong for this set of songs. It starts strong and then slows down, and then picks up again and again slows down, etc. It's difficult to get into. <br /> <br />Now, I don't normally practice in messing with the track order; the band must have had some intent in mind when they put the album together, right? But it's just so darn easy these days with your iTunes! So I started to deconstruct this album and put it back together. In the end I even threw a few of the tunes away, which is certainly an indicator that this is not a \\"Masterpiece\\", but after some tweaking I think it is a very solid listen.  Here's my song by song review in my new edited order (Try it out): <br /> <br />1. Square One (5/5) - This song belongs here. The title, the feeling, the message. It's a good reintroduction to Coldplay and it showcases the band trying out some new dynamics. I actually like it better than \\"Politik\\". <br /> <br />2. Speed of Sound (4/5) - I moved this up to the 2nd track, it's too buried in the original order. Yes, it certainly rips off the \\"Clocks\\" piano riff, but it takes that riff in a different direction and the result is a very satisfying pop song that obviously doesn't stray too far from the \\"Coldplay sound\\". A good first single.  <br /> <br />3. White Shadows (4/5) - Cool song, almost a dance beat working there, but definitely the sound of a band trying something different. And it mostly works, even though it may be a little long.  <br /> <br />4. What If (3/5) - Now it's finally time to slow things down a bit. The lyrical cousin (on a more personal level) of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" and very \\"Beatlesesque\\" sounding. Unfortunately, it's also very Coldplay-sounding, so while it is pleasing to the ear, the overall feeling is that we've been here before. <br /> <br />5. Talk (4/5) - I did not like this one at first, but it's really grown on me. I have to confess that I don't know the original Kraftwerk lick, so I don't have a problem with it, other than it gets a little repetitive. But I like the mood and upbeat tempo of the song, especially the beefy solo towards the end.  <br /> <br />6. Low (3/5) - Once again, I like the idea of Coldplay trying something different, but in this case it doesn't quite work. It's an odd tune and is missing \\"something\\". <br /> <br />7. Fix You (4/5) - This is the one that most people (and the band) are raving about. I have to admit it's not quite working for me yet. I'm not moved the way that \\"The Scientist\\" or \\"Trouble\\" move me. And the problem with that is if you're going for big, grandiouse, emotional statements and you fall short, what do you have left? <br /> <br />8. A Message (5/5) - This is more like it. Yes, the lyrics are a bit trite and I can't help feeling it's been done already (\\"Warning Sign\\" & \\"Green Eyes\\"), but they hit all the right notes and the emotion of the lyrics gets through to me.  <br /> <br />9. The Hardest Part (3/5) - A pleasant enough song. Doesn't try to be anything new or exciting, just a straight-forward pop song. Not their best, but a decent album track. <br /> <br />10. Twisted Logic (4/5) - A good closer. Not as powerful as \\"Amsterdam\\", but it's growing on me. They use a lot of dynamics here that really make you feel like you're going forwards and backwards again. <br /> <br />As you can see, that is where my rearranged album ends. Which means I have tossed 3 tracks - \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" (a good B-Side), \\"Swallowed By The Sea\\" (tedious and annoying at best) and \\"X&Y\\" (very disappointing for a title track). Anytime you have to eliminate 3 tracks from an album, it can't be worth more than 3 stars, which is what I'm giving this album. If they had changed the tracklisting and reduced it to the 10 tracks above, I could easily see this being a 4 or 4 1/2 star album. As it is, 3 stars.   <br /> <br />The only other comment I have is that it feels like Colplay may be in need of a creative-enema. There's a lot of aping going on here - of their own material and of other bands, even to the point of giving one of them songwriting credit. That's not a good sign for a band only into their 3rd album, and with 3 years between albums Two & Three. Hopefully they will be reinspired for the next one. They've got the talent and the chops, now they just need to find their own sound. Enjoy.
B0007GAERG|4.0|This is all about comeback and little about reinvention. When someone reads an album named \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\", one would expect a Mariah's \\"Ray of Light\\", but instead we are presented with the very same formula that made Mariah who she is today. <br /> <br />The first single \\"It's Like That\\" promises something quite new, and even her ballad \\"We Belong Together\\" was not conceived using Mariah's traditional vocal and instrumental tools, but the rest of the album is like a walk on a very well know territory. Nothing new to explore, there. Definitely no \\"Ray of Light\\". This is an album that will make the delights of those who long for the traditional Mariah. <br /> <br />For that reason, I felt like giving it a 3 star review, but then I've decided to listen to the album once again and it felt good to realize that Mariah's vocal power (and that immediately recognizable shrieking we haven't heard since \\"Emotions\\") was in very good shape, meaning she still has a lot of her best self to give us. For that particular reason, I've raised my review by one star. It's good to see that some of those divas from the 90's still have a voice that brings shame to the divas of the new millennium. It's a shame Whitney didn't follow the same path. <br /> <br />So, as a final thought, this an album to listen and not to dance to (with the exception of \\"It's Like That\\") and, to my opinion, it should have been called \\"The Return of Mimi\\" instead, since it has more to do with her reappearance than with her emancipation. <br /> <br />Bye!

B00004XOWM|5.0|this album is the best everyone is complaining because they think limp bizkit are poseurs and they are untalented but if you can make music that is enjoyable then you are considered talented in a way. this album is great because it reminds me of good times when Mobb deep made good music and when Wu Tang was still big and when girl were into pop music and boy bands instead of faking it and saying they listen to rap music meanwhile there favorite artist is Little Ricky and Usher, and meanwhile girls who act gangsta have no idea who rakim is and claim they liked rap. i wish it was back to these days because at least rap music and hip hop was still hardcore and not soft for little girls to be screaming about. this is what sickens me about rap it really makes me sick to my stomach thats why there is only a few rap artist keeping the hardcore still alive. o and this album reminds me of when my friends who were born in 1989 and 1991 used to say they hate girls and now they like girls and im still stranded in home plate...how unfair is that??? this album should be treasure because it reminds me of when i still had chances with girls but now its all gone...
B000001FGG|5.0|I first had WoF on vinyl, many years ago,I recently added the CD to my collection and have rarly had it out of my player since. It is without a doubt one of the greatest albums of all time. Favourite tracks - Sitting on Top of the World, on the studio CD and the whole of the live CD. Jack, Bruce and Eric at their very best it doesn't get better. <br />Can't wait for the Albert Hall concerts to be released.
B000002BBY|2.0|Guitars and drums drone on on this album with little sense of rhythm or definite melody.  Oasis are clearly ambitious artists, as they laquer synthesizers and orchestras on top of endless layers of  guitars. Instead of a wall of sound, however, we get an album that sounds like mud and makes me question whether my speakers are broken.  They aren't, but my taste was when I purchased this album.
B0002IQHY8|2.0|I was surprised to see so much positive feedback for this.  And, while I wish Alan the best and appreciate all of the past magic, this was definately a non-valid path for me. <br /> <br />I should have listened to clips before buying.  But, the cover was cool and cryptic as ever; and, heck it was Alan Parsons. <br /> <br />I've loved every Alan Parsons piece. My favorites being \\"Tales of Imagination,\\" \\"Gaudi,\\" \\"Eve,\\" and the next most recent ones \\"On Air\\" and \\"Time Machine.\\"  If you are expecting music on \\"Valid Path\\" to be in the vein of those....don't. <br /> <br />It has great fidelity (as always), but the music/songs are lost at sea to me. <br /> <br />With humble apologies to Alan.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I am a Nine Inch Nails fan but I'm not one of the cultists that believe that Pretty Hate Machine is the end all be all of Nine Inch Nails.  Unlike alot of other Nine Inch Nails fans, I actually believe there's life beyond Pretty Hate Machine and Broken.  I think Trent's more recent material is much more sophisticated than his earlier work and I have more of a preference toward it.<br /><br />That said, I'd say that this album is a strong album material-wise but I think it lacks the cohesiveness of Downward Spiral and The Fragile.  These albums were much like journeys, the former being a journey into Hell and the latter being an emergence from it.  With this album, although the songs were solid, I didn't real feel I was going anywhere with it.  Hence, the ding to four stars.  Where as with the others along with Broken, I could throw the CD and prepare for an experience.  I just don't have that with this album.<br /><br />I do have favorites though.  \\"Only\\" is my second favorite song on the album.  It's a bassy groove laden track reminiscent of his Pretty Hate Machine stuff but with a modern tint to it.  \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" is an absolutely beautiful ballad and it's my favorite song on the album.  \\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\" is great too.  For some reason, I really like \\"Sunspots\\" too but I can see how some people would find it annoying because there's this weird machine tool sound going on in it.  I think it's kind of cool.  The rest of the tracks are decent but not that memorable.  The strength of the songs that I mentioned and maybe a couple of more pretty much carry the album.<br /><br />For a Nine Inch Nails album, it's pretty sparse but don't take that to mean it sounds naked... just a little more \\"open\\".  There's some interesting piano work throughout the album.  Very basic but melodic stuff.<br /><br />Don't expect anything really groundbreaking from this album and you won't be disappointed.  If you were blown away by \\"The Fragile\\" you won't be by this one.  But that's not all that makes a good album.e by this one.  But that's not all that makes a good album.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|JET is the greatest thing to come from down under, since Steve Irwin. When I first heard Are You Gonna Be My Girl in Madden 2004, I was confused, I thought this was a band from the 1st Woodstock era. Then I heard them and found out this is a new band, I had to here some of their other songs and was not dissapointed. There are alot of great tracks on this CD like my favorite song on the CD \\"Cold Hard B****\\" and \\"Roll-over DJ\\"    You can here the styles of classic rockers in almost every song, You can definently here the Floyd influence in \\"Timothy\\" and the Beatles style of \\"Look What You've Done\\".    I can't wait for their next album to come out.
B00097A5I6|5.0|It was a bit slow for first listen, but it really grows on you. I loved the last albums too, but this one is GREAT! Can not take it out from the player, just goes on and on - if only they would tour this part of the world...MAD FOR IT!
B00005JNQ8|5.0|Non-stop suspense is the order with Sydney Pollack's deftly directed \\"The Interpreter\\" as Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, two talented Oscar winners, interact fluidly in a film that, in addition to entertaining, has a good deal to say about the current international political scene. <br /> <br />Kidman, a United Nations interpreter who has come to New York in hopes of working for peace, overhears a telephone conversation in which two men talk about assassinating a controversial African head of state.  Kidman is one of the few people in town capable of understanding the conversation since the language is that of her home country, an African nation headed by a ruthless strongman who was once a popular military leader but was corrupted ultimately by power and turned against his own people. <br /> <br />Sean Penn, in the midst of tragedy following his wife's death only three weeks earlier, works in a special branch of the Secret Service. When asked to investigate Kidman's revelation he is initially skeptical, but when activities begin heating up and an African is killed by his roommate he realizes that danger lurks. <br /> <br />Circumstances are compounded by the fact that the UN wishes to pursue legal means through the International Criminal Court and that an assassination could make the victim a martyr in the eyes of the people of his nation and further compound instability there.  In the interim the dictatorial strongman is on his way to the UN to address the General Assembly in hopes that he can sway negative public opinion in his direction. <br /> <br />As the story develops it becomes clear that Kidman has a personal stake in the outcome of the emerging tragedy beyond being a citizen of the nation in question.  It is learned that the dictator victimized her family, and that previously she along with so many of the nation's citizenry had admired him greatly. <br /> <br />As the film nears its breathtaking climax Kidman has an opportunity to speak with the dictator.The question is whether she will attempt to deal with him on her own rather than letting international law take its course.  Penn is on the scene and uses his influence to steer matters to a peaceful conclusion in which legality will prevail.
B0001VWP8I|4.0|Anastacia's third album, the self titled \\"Anastacia\\" was not released in the states where I live so I had to wait and wait ans wait for the international post to get here...and it was well worth the wait. This is an excellent album that showcases her voice to the highest extent. Though the harder rock sounds took a couple of listenings to get used to (after her previous, more pop sounding records), this is definitely a must have for any collection, Anastacia fan or not.<br /><br />My favorite songs on this album are \\"Left Outside Alone\\", where we get to hear the softer, more angelic side of her voice. I think she should use this sound more often.<br /><br />My other favorites are \\"Welcome To My Truth\\" and \\"Rearview\\". I loved these the first time I heard them, and then I read the booklet and saw why: They were both co-written by musical genius John Shanks, who has written songs with and for Beth Hart (\\"World Without You\\"), Melissa Etheridge (\\"Angels Would Fall\\";\\"Enough Of Me\\"), Michelle Branch (\\"Everywhere\\"), with production credits on Alanis Morissette's last album, \\"So-Called Chaos\\" and many, many more. He was recently honored by the American Academy of Music with the Grammy Award for Producer Of The Year. In my opinion, John Shanks needs to record an album of his own.<br /><br />But back to Anastacia...<br /><br />This album is definitely her finest work to date and is well worth the listen. Another plus about this album is the fact that the booklet finally includes the lyrics! Her previous two albums did not contain lyrics (at least not in the US version of their release), so this is a real refresher.<br /><br />BUY THIS CD!!!!!!
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|See...the little flying one beaming from the \\"world without fear\\" (The Enchanter).  The picture on the cover draws you right in!  All the complexities of the human soul fanning out and up...I'm intrigued... this recording must have something for me (on top of tickling the Zeppelin chromosome that got fired up in the early 70's with me).  My sweet & wonderful wife picked this up for me for Father's day knowing that I love stuff like this (a true gift, since she doesn't), but as a surprise - MAN, WAS I SURPRISED BY THIS!  I have the whole Zeppelin collection and a few other off-shoot albums of band members (including older Plant) that I've always loved, but I haven't heard the last few Plant albums for the most part.  Guess I've been missing out!  Mighty Rearranger takes you on quite a journey through politics, spirituality, introspection, nostalgia, wisdom and plain old \\"60's revolution\\" psychedelia blended with 70's rock power, world influences & modern musical innovation.  What a great collection of new original songs, and this band is really fun.  I've been into guitar & bass for almost 30 years and this appeals to that interest, but I have been into drumming lately too and this is really fun in that regard (in other words, fun to jam with).  Pick up an instrument and shake it up with Plant and Strange Sensation...\\"Mixing up a potion of laughter and love\\"...Well, smiles all around AND I LOVE IT (the whole thing)!  YOU ROCK!!  Not sure why all of the lyrics weren't included, but I love the surprise reprise bonus at the end.  54:21 minutes (don't know if that includes the fairly long extra song)
0451207521|4.0|\\"Jackdaws\\" is a thrilling historical novel set inWorld War II.  Author Ken Follett tells the story through Major Felicity \\"Flick\\" Clairet of the Special Operations Executive.  Her story is based on the real life of Pearl Witherington.  The novel begins in Sainte Cecile, France where the Germans have taken over a chteau to use as their main telephone exchange.  The resistance force fails miserably in their attack due to poor intelligence.  Back in London, Flick puts together an all women cleaning team which succeeds in blowing up the chteau.  This in turn allows D-Day to be a success.  Unfortunately, out the original six women on the team, only two returned from the mission. <br /> Through \\"Jackdaws,\\" Follett is able to convey the unseen importance of women in the war effort.  Flick and her team are a prime example of this.  Through her snap decisions and ingenuity, Flick is able to outwit German Major Dieter Franck.  Other members of her team are also cited for their bravery, including Jelly, an explosives expert.  Despite her age of forty seven, she volunteers to be a member of the team conquering her fear of parachuting. In real life Pearl Witherington is given the civil MBE award after she is rejected for the Military Cross, given only to men. Saying she had done nothing civil, Witherington returned the award.  It is women like Flick who have allowed other women to advance to where they are today. <br /> I find Follett's book to be a stimulating novel filled with adventure and the empowerment of women.  The adventures comes from Flick and her team sneaking through enemy territory.  One of the heart stopping moments occurs when two members of Flick's team disobey orders and go to the Ritz for dinner.  Flick barely escapes the clutches of Major Franck by killing a guard and commandeering a car.   The two members of her team eating dinner are captured by the Germans.  The trials which Flick and her team face are a true representation that women are skilled and equal to their male counterparts.  I believe that stories such as this allow women to believe in themselves and others.  A masterful work of historical fiction to be enjoyed by World War II fans and many others - \\"Jackdaws.\\" <br />
B0006L16N8|4.0|I am really satisfied with this album, it has good songs, lyrics and tunes. Coldplay are a great band. I still think \\"the scientist\\" and \\"god put a smile upon your face\\" are coldplay's best, as was their previous album, but this is still exelent. I just love this album. <br /> <br />Square one: 4/5 <br /> <br />What if: 5/5 <br /> <br />White shadows: 5/5 <br /> <br />Fix you: 4/5 <br /> <br />Talk: 3.5/5 <br /> <br />x&y: 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Speed of sound: 5/5 <br /> <br />a message: 4/5 <br /> <br />Low: 4/5 <br /> <br />The hardest part: 5/5 <br /> <br />Swallowed in the sea: 4/5 <br /> <br />Twisted Logic: 3.5/5
B0006L16N8|5.0|Even though this album didn't grow on me as quickly as Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head did, after repeated listens I think it is the best album of the three Coldplay has released because of its consistency.  Every track on X&Y is solid and if you like Coldplay in the slightest you should definitely pick this album up.
B000069AUI|4.0|This would be my favorite of theres, great singles and the whole album fits really well. Highly recommended.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Look among the other hits playing on the radio or on the charts, you can see that music today is plain. Things are getting boring with the conformity of genres and no one trying to stand out or being different. Rock in particular today isn't getting any recognition for doing anything \\"great\\". Everything released by new rock bands is generic. But in 2003 A Perfect Circle released their second album, \\"Thirteenth Step\\". <br /> <br />The CD is the works of Maynard James Keenan, Billy Howerdel, Jeordie White, James Iha, Josh Freese with help from Danny Lohner, Paz Lenchantin, Troy Van Leeuwen. As well, a couple of the tracks include the vocals of singer Jarboe. \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is a large, collective effort of many talented musicians to make it one of 2003's Standout Rock albums. A Perfect Circle's album has an overall theme under the name \\"Thirteenth Step\\", taking the title from the 12 Step Program, the songs all have some sort of message dealing with drug abuse, addiction, life and death, and more. <br /> <br />\\"Weak and Powerless\\", one of the singles from the album, starts out with a strong bassline with the message of someone having a problem with alcohol/drugs but they can't fix the problem until they fix themselves. \\"The Outsider\\" is another single that was released off \\"Thirteenth Step\\" and it's written in the viewpoint of an abuser's loved one, relative, etc. All of the songs if you listen closely enough are written in a certain viewpoint of someone dealing with addiction in their own way or even the drug itself. <br /> <br />The hardest track is probably \\"Pet\\", written in the viewpoint of the drug, talking to the abuser. Lyrics stating, \\"Don't fret precious I'm here, step away from the window\\". This album just shows you the outstanding music talents every person that helped out on this record has. The lyrics are well-written, the instrumental pieces are all fitting to the song and how the lyrics speak to the listener. On \\"Thirteenth Step\\", there is no song I could really call a filler, all are great in their own sense. <br /> <br />One of my favorite tracks has to be \\"The Noose\\", starting out with a faint sound of a guitar, you can barely hear. But \\"The Noose\\" gives you a strong feeling and just gets you involved with the music. Maynard's vocals on the song, along with Jarboe in the background, complete the powerful and uplifting sound of the guitars, to make the standout track, to me.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for an album that you can listen to over and over again and still feel pleased with the quality of the work done on the tracks, buy this album. A Perfect Circle's sophmore album surpasses Mer De Noms and shows that they are more then just Maynard James Keenan's side project.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Can it get any worse then this? <br /> <br />This band is awful, are they tryin to take out rageon this album? <br /> <br />That stupid song American Idiot is polluting the airways everytime i turn the radio on. <br /> <br />You have to be a 12 year old to like this but when i was 12 i was into slipknot and korn.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|First daughter was a good movie for the young adult and 20 somethings. Katie holmes plays the presidents daughter that goes away to college and tries to lead a normal life. She ends up having problems discovering who she is and falls in love with a unexpeceted person. This is a great coming of age movie. Katie Holmes did a wonderful job playing the First daughter . Michael Keaton plays the president. Not my first choice for the president but he did a fairly good job. I would recommend this movie if you liked Chasing Liberty and What a girl wants. It is basically on the same level. Chasing Liberty was almost the same movie as this one but I enjoyed both equally. See this movie for a wholesome good movie.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This is a story about a man so alone <br />Even though he has the power <br />Nobody listens to him, because they dont know. <br />He cant say a word <br />Because they will hear him <br />And tear him apart. <br /> <br />  Sounds like Trent read Active Side of Infinity (maybe you should too); but I am unsure if this is the case because Head Like A Whole came out over 8 years prior to the Active Sides release. To place his knowledge of the 'Flyers' is unclear to me.   <br />  This album retains the same feeling of lonliness and knowledge I feel, so I gave it 5 stars. A beautiful piece of musicianship. The music compliments Trent Reznors lyrics perfectly and I was surprized Dave Grohll was in on the recording. The album seemed far too short, but every song was an entire world of assemblage. Awesome. Finally, a good Nine inch Nails record.  <br />  Trent is the voice of our time; if only more of us could hear him. Simply beautiful.  <br />
B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman Begins is, without a doubt, the best movie of the franchise. Less a crowd-pleasing pop video (Batman & Robin, diak!) and much more a true disturbing, adult film, this is the best approximation of Bob Kane's comic book, if not a \\"literal\\" version, which I applaud.<br /><br />The film, directed by genius Christopher Nolan, has at its core, the real struggle of a man who's not perfect, makes mistakes, has a lot of anger but at the same time, tries to balance all those nasty inner feelings by doing something for the \\"greater good\\", but as a flawed man, can't control feeling a little bit excited by tormenting other disguise as a bat (which is a little sick, but understandable).<br /><br />It's complex movie, filled with contradictions that play beautifully against each other. At the core if the plot is, of course, Bruce Wayne, a multimillionaire boy that watches how his loving parents are killed by a mugger, and from that day, becomes a whirl of rage and anger. Guardian by his faithful butler, Alfred (wonderful Michael Caine), Wayne grows intensifying his guilt and hatred, until he leaves to study the natures of evil, and meets Ducard (Liam Neeson), a man who becomes his mentor and teaches him to confront his fears.<br /><br />Wayne decides to return to Gotham City to fight crime and injustice, and in the process decides to use a bat as a symbol to terrorize the criminals that have plagued his natal but very corrupted city. In his fight, some allies help him (Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman's Sergeant Gordon and Katie Holmes' Rachel) in one way or other to achieve his goal, although I must say, with lots of ups and downs.<br /><br />We discover why Wayne identifies with bats, why he hates evil, and this story is given to us with depth and a complex psychological background. The process itself of becoming a hero is slow and full of mistakes. Batman isn't born from one day to other. It takes painful lessons that we are pleased to see.<br /><br />I didn't feel there were a lot of special effects in the movie, but I was grateful for that. Moviemakers often confuse saturation of effects with plot development, and Batman is not one of those films (Episode III is). The characters are given a lot to do to cement the storyline. And there are not cheesy love plots like the past movies, although I must say Holmes's character, though tries to be sort of a working class girl, is so irrelevant (because of her acting, it's like watching Dawson's Creek) we don't mind her fate.<br /><br />Everything in this movie is dark and gritty, from the production design to the characters, and it's a welcome change. The gadgets, the batsuit, even the car is raw and not fancy modern items like they were purchased from a sharper image catalog.<br /><br />In terms of acting, Bale comes strong like the caped crusader, and I can't wait to see him evolve in the next chapter. Freeman and Caine are the other two rocks of this movie, and I loved Gary Oldman vulnerable Sergeatn Gordon.<br /><br />Kudos also to the screenwriter and Chris Nolan, for creating such an remarkable film and the very ultimate definition of what a superhero movie should be. I cant' wait to buy the DVD!didn't feel there were a lot of special effects in the movie, but I was grateful for that.

B000060P79|1.0|I did not buy this album. I stole 5 of them because I wanted to have coasters for the beer that I will drink to forget about this album. First off: I joined Amazon just to say how sucky this piece of crap album is. A co-worker of mine listens to this at work and then he cries all day because he can't figure out why he likes it. WHAT IS PUNK? NOT THESE GUYS! I read an interview in a Guitar World magazine called,\\" Guitar Legends, Punk Rock Special\\" YES, Punk ROck Special. They had Tim Armstrong and Jade Puget. Yes, Rancid and AFI. Then they had the lead singer from Simple Plan giving a wrinkled up, I'm Super-Hardcore Face. What the F***! I oughta kill myself. If Simple Plan is Punk, then Backstreet boys are Black Flag. Simple Plan, I have a simple plan for you: STOP MAKING MUSIC or at the very least, STOP CALLING YOURSELVES A PUNK BAND. NO PADS NO HELMETS NO BALLS!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Well, I came on here to read the reviews that Muse have been getting since they are my favourite band and was wondering how they're being received on the other side of the pond. Like another one of the reviewers, I have followed Muse from the humble beginnings back in the 90s when no one knew who the hell they were and they had no record deal. Absolution is almost 2 years old now but i'm so pleased people over there are loving it.  <br /> <br />And come on, surely we can knock the Radiohead comparisons on the head. Matt Bellamy has a Thom Yorke style voice yes. His voice sounds as much like Jeff Buckley as it does Thom Yorke though. I know the entire catalogue of Muse and Radiohead, and anyone who says that Radiohead have songs which sound, for example, like Butterflies & Hurricanes, Stockholm Syndrome  or Ruled by Secrecy must have a dud Radiohead CD. The influences were evident in Showbiz. That was 6 years ago. It's not cool to jump on the 'they sound like radiohead' bandwagon as if proper Muse fans haven't heard it before, and indeed been hearing it for many years now. It's old, it's not big, it's not clever, and above all it is totally unfounded.
0156907399|5.0|In To the Lighthouse, Virginia Woolf accomplishes a feat that every writer hopes to accomplish in his/her lifetime: she creates out of the ordinary humdrum of the daily life of an English family of Ramsay's characters and paragraphs that will ever be part of the best of English writing produced in last century. In my opinion, several paragraphs in this novel are like jewels of English prose, that must be prized, possessed and displayed likewise. Woolf settles for a very subtle narrative, though which she presents innermost thoughts of her characters, especially women, and in the brilliance of her words, romance and life are captured like snapshots labelled thoughtfully and carefully!<br /><br />The book is sort of divided into two parts, separated by decades. What was most intoxicating part of the book was the description of this change, as was the description of the nightfall. Be it secret thoughts of women or their admirers, or the doubts and uncertainities of a professor-father or the feelings of children (in both times separated by more than a decade) or the simple description of nature, Woolf shows a talent that must make her as important to twentieth century literature as Joyce and Lawrence. She is in my opinion one of the finest (if not the finest) female novelist to have ever existed! Maybe my hyperbole is uncalled for, but my admiration stems from the deep admiration of an exquisite piece of creative writing! Like every classic, this one must be savored with slow speed; deep thoughts, few pages at a time and remembered by the beauty of the sentences and emotions they capture or arouse; and not by the turn of events or unfolding of drama, which even though interesting, is incidental to this incredible piece of literature!
B0000TB01Y|2.0|Some one should drop a house on the composer of these 'songs'.<br /><br />Still, I'm glad the soundtrack for this musical exists. It saves me the $80.00 or more I would have paid for tickets to see the show on stage!<br /><br />For that reason alone I give it two stars instead of one.
B00003CXB6|3.0|...and \\"The Lost World\\" actually might surprise you with some entertaining moments, it's not horrible -but I must say I agree with many reviewers here; Why did the talented Spielberg even bother to make this sequel? This belongs among his \\"weaker\\" movies. <br /> <br />My favorite scene however is when the ship crashes into land, something about this \\"scenario\\" is so... what's the word..? Well, when you hear the sound of the engine of the ship getting louder and louder -it's something so authentic about it. Well arranged and exiting. I think. <br /> <br />But; <br /> <br />I can't explain how on earth the big \\"dino\\" was able to get to the people in the controll-room of the ship, at least not without ruining the entire bridge. I mean, even the windows look intact. Hm..? A little embarrassing, check it out yourself. <br /> <br />Other than that, nothing new, but good effects -and a quite entertaining sequel to a movie that could have been a lot better too.
B00008YJH5|5.0|Sometimes perfection is defined in the simplest of terms. The label of mediocrity is placed on the non deserving. This album is sheer pandemonium. For some reason, unknown to me this album was extremely hard to acquire in my irksome city of Houston. I happened to come across a copy of this after calling Virgin Megastore, New Orleans on Decatur. I reserved my copy and in 6 hours I was in New Orleans, and got it immediately. I first heard this masterpiece from a guy from another band I was collaborating with in his car. As an immesurable Nirvana (non commercial material) fan, the guy told me that this was one of the late Kurt Cobain's favorite albums. The album is noisy, brassy, and just plain bizarre. You often find yourself asking, \\"how did they get those tones out of that guitar\\" all  that vibrato makes one pick up theirs in astonishment and try to recreate those sounds coming out of that boombox. This album is reminiscent of 80s New Wave, but faster. Vocalist, Charles Thompson, Frank Black, Black Francis, or whatever you may is truly a gifted composer. His vocal performance on this album has the ability to portray feelings like no other. He can make you go from being filled with anger and wanting to riot, ie: \\"Something against you\\", then to feeling like a youngster again, with bassist Kim Deal's \\"Gigantic\\". When I listen to this album, I am taken back to a few years ago, when I first purchased the album, and listened to it everywhere I went in New Orleans. Much to my dismay, The Pixies had broken up. In October of 2004 I had the opportunity to see the band live for their reunion concert. It was absolutely wonderful. And as an added incentive to purchase this magnum opus, Where is my mind? is right smack dab in the middle of the album. What a beautiful song.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|This movie doesn't have much to offer. It's typical horror, psychological stuff that will either thrill you or leave you wondering why you even bothered to rent it. And one shock (which happens in the end) doesn't make up for a mediocre movie. The characters don't learn anything about themselves, the \\"killer's\\" (he's more like a puppermaster) motivation lacks depth, and his choice of victim is screwy with what motivation we do get. This movie is just, well, stale. <br /> <br />So Adam and Lawrence wake up in a dirty bathroom, each chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room with a guy who has blown his head off laying between them. They don't remember how they got there, nor do they know why they of all people were so unfortunate as to end up in a smelly, disgusting bathroom. Lawrence thinks he knows who did it-- the same guy, known as the jigsaw killer, who had killed (or rather set up his victim's to kill themselves) several people. We learn that Lawrence was a suspect. Anything of importance about Adam, Lawrence, and the killer, are revealed in a series of flashbacks. It's a tad confusing, but it's all sorted out in the end. And the final shock is actually pretty good. I didn't see it coming.  <br /> <br />This movie is just under par in terms of character. I really want to see a horror movie that has a killer with awesome motivation and victims who use their heads instead of machetes to discover the mystery murderer. If Lawrence had thought about the situation a little more, he would've concluded that sawing his foot off (yes, he does that, and it's cringe-worthy) was a bad idea. Not a bad movie, not a good movie, just a typical Saturday night horror flick. Better than other horror films that have come out recently though. House of Wax, anyone?
B0009HLDFU|4.0|I really like the Foo Fighters and this new double album is just like all of the others, awesome!  I bought it the day it came out expecting good things and I got it. #'s 3,4,6,7 are my favorite on the first disc.  All you haters, no need to write bad things about the Foo.  So they made a uncopyable CD, so what!  Go whine to yo mama!
B000000LZV|5.0|Creative, original, ingenius! Intriguing music blends with thoughtful lyrics to make an album that will stand and has stood the test of time.
B00005ATQH|5.0|Never read Nabokov's novel but for my money, this is one of the most sophisticated film comedies of all time--and one that looks better every year as we are subjected to ever more crappy movies each decade. James Mason, Shelley Winters (too bad the plot hinged on her demise so early in the film--she's never been funnier) and Peter Sellers are in top form and even neophyte Sue Lyons more than holds her own. Dazzling dialog, a super early Sixties score and striking b&w cinematography only add to the fun. Truly a film for the ages. . .or under-ages!
B0002858YS|5.0|This album is a great addition to American Pop Culture. Good music, fun lyrics, and a heart felt voice behind it all. There is definitly a 'synth-pop' re-invention happening, and I say.. none too soon. Away from the \\"booty-rap\\" and weak 'R&B'... distance yourself from the pain that are the Avril Lavigne's and Nickel Back's of the time.<br /><br />This album reminds what good music is all about. Straight to the core, gets to the point... shiny enough, not too bold and great at what it aims to be - in this case, good POP.<br /><br />Tainted is the word 'POP' as are we as a culture - all  by the 'boy band' phenom. that was the 90's. SO WHAT! It happened, and here is another stage of the music timeline... love it or hate it.. the Killers album, HOT FUSS, both the tracks on the U.S. and U.K. version, are worth the time. Enjoy it, it's what it's there for!
B0006L16N8|2.0|I'm a big Coldplay fan and absolutely adored the last two albums. <br />I can honestly say that there isn't one song in Parachutes or A Rush Of Blood To The Head that I don't like. <br /> <br />When I listened to this new album for the first time I had big expectations and was basically hoping for more of the same. <br /> <br />Unfortunately my worst fears came true in that Coldplay have basically run out of ideas in this album.  <br /> <br />I've tried listening to it a few times in the hope that it would grow on me like the previous albums but i'm afraid the majority of this album is just plane boring and completely unentertaining. <br /> <br />I see a lot of reviewers on this site obviously enjoy this album, one even going as far as claiming it as the best coldplay album yet. <br />I only hope that as the singles are released and i am bombarded with them every day on radio i too will see what these other people see in this album, unfortunately i doubt it.
B000089RVX|1.0|This band has no class whatsoever this album can be learn`t in a day easily its that simple.We have a female vocalist who sounds as if she hasn`t had her period guiarists who make recorders sound like a pleasanat sound and the drums this band must of found him in the junk mail in their letterbox.yes if your a loser this is for you and don`t wear a loser top if you listen to this band society will spot you.
0596007124|5.0|I've been programming for quite a long time. So have a bunch of my friends and co-workers. I had heard about design patterns (who hasn't?), but aside from the occasional magazine article had never actually read about them. Like so many of my peers, I figured that somebody just formalized a bunch of stuff that I already knew, so why waste the time and money on a book. <br />Well, this book won't be a waste of your time or money. Sure, it presented a lot of concepts that I already kinda knew at a gut level, but it did so in a more informative, formal and structured way, the end result of which makes you more cognizant of \\"design patterns\\", literally. What does this buy you? Well, as the authors point out, it helps you THINK in terms of PATTERNS as you try to solve a problem. And this (I believe) will lead to better overall designs - which will definitely pay big dividends when the time comes for the code to change. And we all know it will. <br />One final note: This is my first \\"Head First\\" book, and I was very, very impressed with it. I always thought dense paragraphs coupled with code listings was the way to go because, well, because that's how computer science books are written. This book makes one AWARE of how one is learning, and that in and of itself can have HUGE rewards as one goes through life.

B00005JNJT|5.0|After being bitterly disapponted after seeing Revenge of the Sith I was half expecting to see another dismal franchise film, thankfully I was wrong.<br /><br />Batman Begins is a fantastic film in most ways, it's entertaining, action packed, has a good mix of chemisty with the talent, decent plot with some twists and most importantly it has ninjas. Any films with ninjas in it can't be too bad after all.<br /><br />This film is dark like the original Burton films but has a better cast, plot and overall style to it. I thought the best Batman was Micheal Keaton, however Christian Bale captures the character of moody Bruce Wayne just as well or even better than Keaton.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with any film that has the acting likes of Morgan Freeman in it, like Samuel L. Jackson Freeman always delivers a certain cool and an excellent performance to ANY film he has starred in.<br /><br />Gary Oldman and Liam Neeson also add to the overall effectiveness of the plot with both actors making their roles in this film their own and adding a distinct class and style to the movie.<br /><br />Go see this film you wont be disappointed, now just have to wait for DVD to be released.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I'll never forget 1997, sitting in my best friend Alec's basement, each of us holding a brand new copy of \\"OK Computer\\" in our hands, we had just purchased it out of curiosity.  We had heard such raving reviews and had to see what all the fuss was about.  We had honestly mostly been listening to new Notorious B.I.G., R. Kelly and other things disconnected to a band like Radiohead.  We put it in and from the first slap fuzzy bass of \\"Airbag\\" we were uncomparably destroyed.  We sat in silence and listened in awe to the entire album through and through.  Each day we listened to it and questioned how these noises, songs, words, ideas, philosophies and mysteries had never come to us before, how we had not known of this talent, of the world beyond the one we knew: Radiohead's soundscapes.  Years later in France, I was standing outside of La Basilique du Sacre Coeur de Montmarte in Paris and I had my headphones on, it was night, and I was pumping \\"OK Computer\\" as I looked over Paris.  That was one of the most powerful moments of my life and I realize why, I was listening and in that world, the world this album makes available the second it begins.  I believe in music and I love Radiohead, they inspire me to continue being a musician myself.  I can't wait to see them this summer at Bonnaroo, what a show it will be.
0060736267|5.0|\\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is an amazing book, by Betty Smith. The story is centered around Francie Nolan's life in Brooklyn, in the early twentieth century. The wealth of detail surrounding the characters in this book is simply amazing. It describes the people so avidly, that I feel like I knew them my whole life.  <br />It takes a great author to make you feel the emotions of characters in the book, and Betty Smith does it without a flaw. This book will leave you elated, sad, scared, and touched. Overall, a wonderful journey that takes us back to the early 1900s, and forces us to feel all of Francie's emotions.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Being a Mac fan for a few decades and having many of their albums, I've come to expect certain things from them and that's exactly what Say You Will gave me. <br />    THE BAD:  First of all, you know you're going to get some wild Lindsey experimentation songs and that is what you get in the tracks, \\"Murrow Turning over in his Grave\\", \\"Red Rover\\" and the incomprehensible \\"Come\\".  These songs may have been better saved for Lindsey's next solo album - they are a bit extreme for the fair-weather Fleetwood Mac fans.  <br />   I've also come to expect a couple bland Stevie Nicks songs and there are certainly a few of those.  \\"Illume\\" is a song still searching for a melody.  It has the old Stevie habit of setting a beat in the background while she jams in some lyrics that don't seem to fit with any sort of melody.  There have been many 9-11 tribute songs and this is one of the most forgettable of them all. Likewise, \\"Silver Girl\\" is the most uninspired and uninspiring song on the CD.  It sounds like Stevie just woke up when she sang the song.  These songs remind me a bit of her two contributions to the \\"Tango in the Night\\" album (\\"Welcome to the Room...Sara\\",  \\"When I see you Again\\") which rumor has it Lindsey wanted to cut from that album.  <br /> <br />  THE GOOD:  But wait...this album is certainly not all bad.  First of all, Stevie's contributions to this album are far better than the aformenentioned \\"Tango\\" album.  The title track, \\"Say you Will\\"  is a wonderful song with a catchy melody (the kind of song Christine McVie used to contribute).  \\"Running through the Garden\\" and \\"Thrown Down\\" are also highlights on the album, proving that Stevie still has the ability to write good songs and contribute more than her voice to a Fleetwood Mac project. <br />   There are also some memorable tracks from Lindsey. \\"Miranda\\" blends Lindsey's and Stevie's voices together well and has a catchy guitar hook.  This song would have sounded very at home on the \\"Tango\\" album (a combination of \\"Big Love\\", \\"Caroline\\" and the title track.) <br />   \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" I know was on \\"The Dance\\" but is such an outstanding song, it was worth bringing it back for a studio version.   <br />    But by far the best song on the album is for some reason buried at track #13.  You will find yourself singing \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" over and over and hitting the repeat button often for this song.   <br /> <br />   CONCLUSION:  This CD is a mixed a bag that could have been made into a much better piece of work by simply trimming it down a bit.  Eliminate the Lindsey experiments and Stevie's rambling songs and this would have been a much better album. <br />    I think it also would have benefitted FM commercially to release \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" as the first single.  This would have attracted the occasional or slightly interested Fleetwood Mac fans to buy the CD.  \\"Peacekeeper\\" was a bit too dark and likely scared off the casual Mac fans.   <br />    Imagine if \\"Say You Will\\" hit the stores looking like this: <br />   <br />    1. \\"What's the World Coming To\\" <br />    2. \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" <br />    3. \\"Thrown Down\\" <br />    4. \\"Say You Will\\" <br />    5. \\"Miranda <br />    6. \\"Running through the Garden\\" <br />    7. \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" <br />    8. \\"Peacekeeper\\" <br />    9. \\"Say Goodbye\\" <br />   10. \\"Goodbye Baby\\"
B0009PVZWI|3.0|Don't believe all the hype.  This, despite Dave Grohls comments, is NOT the best Foo Fighters album.  In fact compared to the other Foo albums this ranks (for me) as one of the worst.  It easily could have been one disk.  I only liked five of the 20 songs on the album.  Don't see the need to have Norah Jones on the album as she just mimicks Dave's vocals (besides who the hell is Norah Jones anyway?).  About the only cool thing on here is the fact that John Paul Jones of Led Zep fame plays on a couple of the tracks.  Snoozer of a Foo album.  Go buy one of there earlier better albums.
B00006D295|5.0|For years i have always heard talk of The Rocky Horror Picture Show from my peers, and finally i got to renting the film and watching it for myself to see the hype. One word: CLASSIC!! I honestly didn't think i would like it as much as i did, and i was surprised in how catchy the songs were, on my first viewing i started to sing the lyrics out loud! This is truly a cult classic (probably the only movie in film history that has coined that name), and a fun affair to boot. It's weird, it's appealing, it's fun, it's sexy, it's naughty, and it's just absolutely strange. What's there not to love about a male transvestite in makeup, stockings, and a garter belt? Or not to love about the innocent and virginal Janet and Brad? And the absolutely gorgeous and hunky Rocky? And whether people like to admit it or not, the songs are catchy, \\"Time Warp,\\" \\"Sweet Transvestite,\\" and \\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch me\\" will stick in your head! This is truly a film that should be watched with friends (drunk or not) for its naughty good fun. These are what cult films are made of!
B0006L16N8|5.0|\\"X&Y\\" is a flowering masterpiece by Coldplay and shouldn't be dismissed so quickly by all the haters out there. This latest collection of songs by Martin & Co. embrace a more muscular approach and were most likely written for rounding out Coldplay's setlist when they play large arenas and stadiums. This is a much bolder and rocking effort than the other Coldplay albums.<br /><br />On \\"X&Y\\", the guitarist, Johnny Buckland, is the main feature, by beefing up the overall presence of the guitar sounds that will certainly jolt a live audience. Beautifully soaring and melodic licks are prominent all over \\"X&Y\\"'s 12 tracks. Also, the typical 4/4 beats so prominent on past Coldplay albums, have sort of seen a departure on \\"X&Y\\" where the drummer employs much more upbeat and indie rock styles to give these tunes much groove and intricate flavor, certain to inspire dancing at any future Coldplay concerts. The bass guitar is perfectly solid on this album and is the rock of this band.<br /><br />And last but not least singer Chris Martin is in amazing form, as he was on the other records, but somehow, the new father exposes more emotion and urgency in his voice today than yesterday. The lyrics work for me. I'm not looking for Chris Martin & Coldplay to change my world with the deepest of deepest metaphors and such lyrical enlightenments, just give me some great rock music that I learn to love again and again.<br /><br />I think I'll be listening to Coldplay's \\"X&Y\\" for a very long time.
B00005GL0R|5.0|SGT. PEPPER is the most celebrated rock album ever.  However, that's different from being the &quot;greatest&quot;.  (I reserve that honour for 1966's REVOLVER.)<br />PEPPER was the most ambitious and elaborate album of its time.  The record elevated the lowly status of the vinyl LP to Art which changed the music industry forever.  It was a self-conscious work of art, self-contained with a theme, featuring ornate arrangements and some brilliant songwriting and performing.  Experimentation abounds.  There's no disputing the influence this record has had since its release on June 1, 1967.<br />However, I talk about its quality.  Do the songs hold up?  Some do, others don't.  Side A is the superior half of PEPPER.  The title track features a biting, acid guitar and great screaming by Paul.  The song draws you into the album instantly.  WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS is a perfect song for Ringo who relies on John and Paul do provide him a vocal on this record.   <br />John's LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS is a highlight, with its childlike imagery and haunting keyboard phrase.  GETTING BETTER and FIXING A HOLE are really the same song, done fast and slow.  SHE'S LEAVING HOME is a mini-opera, featuring a beautiful melody, but nearly drowns in an overlush string arrangement.  MR. KITE isn't a great song, but it is saved by an imaginative &quot;wash&quot; of sound in the middle eight and at the coda.<br />PEPPER starts to falter on WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU.  George's lone contribution is an interesting experiment that marries Western classical instruments with Indian ones, but it is an overlong, preachy song.  WHEN I'M 64 is one of Paul's &quot;granny&quot; songs, but it has its charms, and I can't fault it.  However, LOVELY RITA is a trifle by Paul, as is GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING which reflects John's bordom living in the suburbs.<br />The SGT. PEPPER REPRISE is a clever way of uniting the album -- which is really a disparate collection of songs with little unity.<br />Had PEPPER ended there, I don't think the album would have its legendary status.  It takes A DAY IN THE LIFE, the stunning closer, to cement PEPPER's status as a work of art.  Simply put, A DAY IN THE LIFE is the greatest closing song on any Beatles' record, and possibly by any band.  Lennon's vocal is haunting, as he sings about the death of his friend, Tara Browne, then reflects upon the movie (referring to How I Won The War) that a crowd of people turns away from.  Paul's middle-eight of waking up and rushing to work/school is a lucky stroke of genius, perfectly fitting into the theme of the song, which is the loneliness of daily life.  The song ends on a 50-second final note, a crash of piano chords that evokes death.<br />I love PEPPER, but it's not my favourite record.  More accurately, I admire the album for elevating rock 'n' roll to Rock.  However, in this case the legend overshadows the quality.
B0001Z363W|5.0|Yeah I know this album is mostly accoustic stuff, but I like it so what. This album shows both depth and emotion, but it still has it's heavy parts to please alot of metalheads like myself. Zakk Wylde's eye popping guitar solos on here will make you grin in delight. \\"House of Doom\\" was the first song I heard off this album, and it's my favorite song on here as well. Crazy or High, Damage is Done, Queen of Sorrow, Steppin Stone, Layne, and She Deserves a Free Ride (Val's Song) are other good songs I like on here.

B00006FMDA|3.0|I have to agree that A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is the Citizen Kane of rock movies.  It's funny, charming, cleverly-directed, well-scripted and beautifully shot.  Most rock movies are exploitation pieces that showcase a band on the big screen with little regard to story or design.  A HARD DAY'S NIGHT stands as a Film in its own right.<br />What I don't like is the DVD.  It's a lousy package.  Most unforgiveable is the horrible, muddy, bass-heavy mono mix that sounds like it was produced at the bottom of a swamp.  What the hell is this?<br />My old MPI VHS tape sounds much better than this.  The songs were in bright, beautiful stereo.  This DVD is an abomination.  Does anyone at Miramax or Apple have ears?  Does anybody care, or are these corporations just interested in ripping off Beatles fans?  Is there no respect for a great film and great music?<br />Aside from that rant, I have mixed feelings about the extras.  We have loads of recollections from supporting actors and bit players.  These are entertaining as a whole, but the special features depend on them too much.  Where's the director's commentary -- or anybody's?  Where's the 50-minute documentary (narrated by Phil Collins) that came out on DVD in the mid-90s, called THE MAKING OF A HARD DAY'S NIGHT?<br />I would rate this package 5 stars if it offered its customers something intelligent, but sadly this DVD smells of greed.  Sure, you need to see A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  I just wish this release did it with class.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplays new cd X&Y is amazing.  It took three years for the band to put outbut it was well worth the wait.  The new songs are awesome, you never have to hit skip.  I was lucky enough to see one of the Buzz Gigs (very small venue show before teh cd came out) and the new material sounds even better live.  Everyone should get this cd, love it and see them live.  One word describes it all : WOW.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Same arranger on cd, is same arranger who work with many great Verve lp for Antonio Carlos Jobim.  To some may sound like elevator music, but to me itbeautiful and romantic.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down - Mezmerize, people seem to have really mixed feelings about this cd. I will be honest, first couple of times listening, I was really let down... Too much of darron singing.. <br />I dont bash people, but he really needs to stick to guitar... Serj just has the voice for system... Anyway,Yes the cd is short, What S.o.a.D. cd, isnt short??? I think its just right, any longer you may get bored with the cd...But I really like this cd, I really dont skip any tracks except for Cigaro... That song is just obnoxious in my opinion, I get the political message behind it, but its just too obnoxious... Anyway BYOB, Sad Statue, T.C.M.M.F.L.I.O.T.S., Revenga are the best definately solid songs!!! Cant wait for the next cd, should be great!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's OK Computer is not an easy listen for many people the first half-dozen or so times they hear it, while some fall completely under its spell the first time. <br />Repeated plays have revealed the true beauty of this masterpiece for some. Others have found that they have to kind of give themselves over to it, in a way, to \\"get it.\\" <br />It's catchy with hooks aplenty. The musicmanship is amazing. The lyrics are meaningful. It's hard, it's fast, and it's slow and easy. <br />I bought it soon after it came out because of all of the critical praise it had received, of course. I honestly couldn't stand it when I first heard it. I forced myself to play it a few times within the first year after I got it, thinking that it might grow on me. It only slightly latched onto my brain. It had by no means become a favorite. It then sat on my shelf untouched for over two years. <br />Later, while purging my CD collection of albums I never listened to, I paused when I came to this CD. I couldn't toss it for some reason. I decided to give it another try. <br />I was in a great, mellow mood. My anti-depressants were working great for me that day! I had to take a long drive and popped the CD in and turned it up loud. That's when it struck me, \\"crack!\\" like a brick upside the head. This was one of the most enchanting, powerful albums I had ever heard. <br />I have no idea why I didn't understand this marvelous album before. Honestly. Perhaps the phase of my life I was in at the time didn't correlate with a somewhat eclectic, artistically wonderful album like this. Maybe my brain just didn't know what to think of it because I had never heard anything like it before. <br />Whatever the case, this album opened up my eyes to a whole new world of stunning music. <br />To this day, I still feel the same way every time I listen to it -- just without the \\"brick across the head\\" sensation.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|OK. First of all I would like to start by commenting on Gerard Butler's performance. It's true that he is not Michael Crawford, but he is still wonderful in the role. I know from reading the book, that the Phantom should be hideous and probably older, but I think that this version is just as good. Gerard Butler brings on a new, more modern twist on this character. People have mentioned that his voice and performance lack emotion, but i beg to differ. His voice, unlike Crawford's nasal one, brings plenty of power and emotion. It is also seductive and bewitching at the same time. His acting was not bad at all, in my opinion, in fact I think that he portrayed the Phantom perfectly. I have heard mentioned that Webber wanted a more rock sound to the Phantom's voice, and I feel that Butler brought that aspect to the film perfectly. He was very easy to identify with, and I found myself wanting to give him a hug and comfort him in his sorrow. I don't think that another actor could have done that.  <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum was wonderful as Christine Daae. People have complained that she is not Sarah Brightman, and to those people I say this: Christine Daae is supposed to be YOUNG and vulnerable and inexperienced in the ways of the world. Sarah Brightman is NOT young! Do you honestly believe that having older (much older) actors in the roles would be wise? But anyways, back to Emmy. I really enjoyed her performance. Yes, I too noticed that her mouth is hanging open through most of the movie, but she is basically in a sort of trance when the Phantom is near, and I think that if you consider that fact, then the mouth open-ness shouldn't be too much of a problem. She brought the naivety to the role, and did an excellent job. Her voice was beautiful, and she was wonderful with the high notes. <br /> <br />Patrick Wilson did a good job as well. I am not much of a Raoul fan, but I think that he did a good job portraying the Vicomte. He reminded me of the prince from Beauty and Beast. His voice wasn't quite what I would have liked, but I think that he was perfect as Christine's childhood sweetheart.  <br /> <br />Many people have complained about Minnie Driver's Carlotta. She is supposed to be obnoxious, and over the top! I think that Driver was a perfect Carlotta, and brought some humour to the film. <br /> <br />Overall I think that the film was fantastic! I have seen it seven times, and as soon as I buy it I am sure I will watch it even more. The music was fabulous, and ever since seeing it 'The Phantom of the Opera is there inside my mind...'. <br />
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Now here is what you call a Masterpiece DVD (if the audio in DTS is corrected!)..., or what Stereophile Magazine calls: M2DF (Music To Die For). This is an extremely well produced DVD, from its outstanding jewel box, inside pamphlet, 2-DVD's (it's 3 hours long!), its camera works and edition, and its performance ambience captured at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia in 2004. The people from the Downunder got a real treat of America's legendary band at its best. This DVD should be played loud through your Surround System... but mind you, it was mixed solely on the DTS format (and not Dolby Pro-Logic - a mistake!), and in my opinion, they could have done a much better job, as in some instances you cannot hear the background musician solos, and in other cases, you can even hear some \\"wow & flutter\\" on the lower frequences, something that I found very annoying for such a fine concert well edited on the video section. I do hope that Executive Producer, Glenn Frey, is able to pick-up on this, as he is very finniky about good sound, and are able to correct the audio portion on the numerous DVD's that are already out in the market with digital errors on the DTS mix that need to be seriously corrected.<br /><br />Oh, and by-the-way, if you like this DVD (which you should buy) and its music, check out also a band from Australia, BSG (Birtles, Shorrock and Goble) which just released their DVD in the US and its titled \\"Full Circle\\" (Capitol). They are as good as The Eagles in terms of their fine voices, music material and stage presence, also in a live performance recorded in Melbourne in 2003. This is a masterpiece production and is extremely well mixed and edited in Dolby Pro-Logic as well as in DTS. It's just great. Enjoy the music! And play it LOUD!
B000068IEU|2.0|This is Wes Craven's first film, and a somewhat deservedly infamous movie.  Certainly, it tried to push the borders of what a film could do, particularly back in 72.  The fact of the matter is, however, that the execution in this film is just so botched that it doesn't much matter how extreme it's trying to be.  The performances are too weak, and the effects are too lame for this movie really to work.  And mind you, this is coming from a horror fan's perspective, and one who can and has accepted the budgetary limits of these sorts of films.  'Night of the Living Dead', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Martin' and 'Cannibal Holocaust' were all made on similarly miniscule budgets, and are each masterpieces of the horror genre, each unquestionably in my top ten of the genre, and readily overcaming their budgetary limits.  'The Last House on the Left', however, just can't pull it off, for a number of reasons.<br /><br />David Hess is pretty much the only high point of the film.  He's sufficiently vicious and sleazy, though his performance faulters greatly at times. (See the final minutes of the film)  Unfortunately, his performances is completely negated by the rest of the gang, who are horrible and dated walking cliches, who aren't remotely frightening or convincing.  Junior is particuarly horrible,  He's meant to be the 'good one', but he's just so stupid and obnoxious that he's almost unbearable to watch.  The cops are even worse, and really hurt the film.  The whole movie has got a theoretically comic subplot involving the police investigating the girls' disappearance, which totally kills an already not very good movie.  The cops are, again, unrelentingly obnoxious, and the whole subplot just ruins whatever little mood the film may have created.  And don't give me any of this crap about how the cop subplot is satirical and whatnot: It's filler, plain and simple, regardless of what it may have been intended to be.  The film would've been all of 50 minutes without it, so Craven had to dump some extra stuff in.<br /><br />Finally, the shocking violence is largely just boring and unconvincing.  It's occasionally uncomfortable, particularly the sexual stuff, but mostly they just sit around, or wander around the forest, attempting to escape.  And the final killings are largely just stagey and melodramatic.  The  parents' revenge is equally lame, particularly the dads' endless chasing of Krug about the house, and the oral castration scene, a scene infinitely funnier than one would imagine such a scene could be. (Krug's making Junior commit suicide is pretty good, however.  The rest of it is pretty lame, however)<br /><br />This movie finds itself in a tough place.  Do what it's trying to do well, and it would be too unbearable.  Do what it actually did, and it's just kinda boring and stupid, for the most part.  This film is historically significant, and something of a curiosity, so serious horror fans shouldn't hesitate to see it.  But, it's just not very good.<br /><br />Grade: D+n had to dump some extra stuff in.       Finally, the shocking violence is largely just boring and unconvincing.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Here's my review of one of my favorite albums. Linkin Park's Meteora.  <br /> <br />I really think that this album was a great follow-up to Hybrid Theory. HT was huge, and I still love it to this day, but I gotta say this album really is about equal in greatness to it. Here's the song-by-song breakdown. I can't really rate them, cuz there's not a bad song I've ever heard by Linkin Park in my opinion. I love every one of them. <br /> <br />1. Foreword- A short little song with an awesome ending of shattered glass, which is an awesome opening to our next song... <br />2. Don't Stay- A really hardcore song, the one of the hardest on the album, a great song to mosh to. One of my friends actually blew the windows out of a truck with this song. lol <br />3. Somewhere I Belong- This song really deserved being a single. I adored this song, it was one of my favorites from the first listen. I just couldn't figure out what those mammoth things were on the video. o_o; lol <br />4. Lying From You- Another hardcore song, really loud, just an awesome song. I really wish they had the scream on at the beginning like they did on Live In Texas. That scream rocked. lol <br />5. Hit The Floor- Had a sort of Asian feel to it, but it was a cool song, formerly one of my favorites, but it's not as high up there anymore. <br />6. Easier To Run- I see Crawling written ALL OVER this one. It's a lot like Crawling, but it is still a really cool song. I dunno, I've always liked this one. <br />7. Faint- Another single. The violins really do the song justice. It has a really strong chorus too, great lyrics. 'Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored'.  <br />8. Figure.09- Overall, my favorite song on the album. I have loved this song from the first time I heard it. It just sounded so eerie but awesome. I just wonder why this wasn't a single...I always thought it was great enough to be one. <br />9. Breaking The Habit- This song is really good, though they kinda overplayed it on the radio whenit first hit it big. Not a bad thing at all, more LP fans jumped on the bandwagon. lol <br />10. From The Inside- I never knew this song had a video! I found the thing on the net the other day. It rules! lol Anyway... This song just flat out rules, and it has really good DJ-ing going on,  go Mr. Hahn. lol <br />11. Nobody's Listening- Hey, it's a rap. But not an all bad one either. I really enjoyed this song, and the flute accompaniment really helped.  <br />12. Session- Pure instrumental. I liked it, though I thought Cure For The Itch from Hybrid Theory and the song Technique on Hybrid Theory EP were better. It sounds really good, I just wanted some DJ scratching in my instrumentals, man. lol <br />13. Numb- Anyone who hears the signature soundboard opening knows this song's coming up. I just love that soundboard part throughout the whole song. Has really good lyrics, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br /> <br />That's Meteora in a nutshell. I highly recommend this album to fans of new rock. Look into getting Hybrid Theory, too, if you don't have it.
B0000025RI|5.0|Most tend to overlook Michael Jackson when referring to the greatest albums of all time. But, despite his eccentric nature, there is no question that his best album, \\"Thriller\\", is simply one of the greatest albums of all time, as it truly provides the listener with anything and everything they are looking for. From the hard metal in the song \\"Beat It\\" to the dance-inducing beats of my personal favorite song, \\"Billie Jean\\", Thriller is a must purchase for all fans of music. He also provides for a change of pace with songs like \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and a truly great duet with Paul McCartney in \\"The Girl Is Mine\\". And don't forget the title song, \\"Thriller\\", a song which inspired one of the greatest music videos of all time. <br /> <br />Michael Jackson, as one of the truly great artists of all time, truly put its all together in this classic, and shows the world how to truly sing, dance, and entertain. He may seem to be quite a buffoon today, to say the least, but that should not take away from his glorious past, and the music which inspired millions.

B0006L5RT2|5.0|When I first heard James Blunt's 'HIGH' as the background music in a tv commercial, I knew this guy was going to be a big hit.  His songs are beautifully performed and sung with such a sincerity that brightens any dull day.  I particularly love So Long, Jimmy, but listeners will definitely put this cd in their top-listening list.  I found it here in Italy for 12.90 euros, but for those living in the U.S., this is one cd to add to your collection.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|An awful, AWFUL movie! I am a huge comedy lover and decided to watch this movie on DVD after I heard a bunch of friends rave about it. Needless to say I will never, ever trust their movie taste again. There is absolutely no plot to this film. I fell asleep half way through the movie because I was THAT bored. The main character had all of three lines that were just repeated over and over. It really would have been better for that weird of a character to just appear in a single scene of a movie that actually made sense. Then maybe his \\"idiot!\\" line would have been a bit more comical.
B00007J36V|5.0|`Unhalfbricking' by the original Fairport Convention is the album with which they caught everyone's attention, as it has three exceptionally strong components going for it. First are the two songs by Sandy Denny, `Autopsy' and the memorable `Who Knows Where the Time Goes'. Second are the two songs by Richard Thompson. Third are the performances of three Bob Dylan songs which Mr. Dylan rarely performs himself.<br /><br />After this great start with modern compositions and with such great chemistry between the principles in this group, it is surprising why they went off to do classic English folksongs in their most famous album, `Liege and Leif' and why Denny and Thompson spun off to do their own thing. I'm sure that they had their reasons, but that meant they never quite duplicated the quality of work on this album and the others the original group did together. So, the reincarnations of `Fairport Convention' have been making a career out of performing `Matty Groves' over and over again.<br /><br />Getting back to `Unhalfbricking', I can still remember running into the British Import LP when I was under the spell of both `The Incredible String Band' and `The Pentangle' plus Bert and John and all those British folkies. So, the promise of more of the same was too good to pass up, before I happened to notice the heavy presence of Bob Dylan songs on the album. I do confess that the great cover photo of the walled lawn and the church tower in the background had a lot to do with my purchase.<br /><br />I can't remember my exact impressions upon first hearing the album, except that I was tickled by the Dylan pieces and very much moved by the `Who Knows Where the Time Goes'. Listening to the album now, after 36 years, I wonder why no one does this kind of stuff anymore. I am not as much in tune with popular music today as I was in the 1960s, but I really miss having no fresh faces which strike me now as strongly as Dylan, Phil Ochs, Richard Farina, Tom Paxton, Tom Rush, Robin Williamson,  Denny and Thompson, and so on did at that time.<br /><br />I really envy you, fair reader, if you are discovering the original Fairport Convention for the first time. They successfully capture a part of the Zeitgeist of the 1960s, which is so precious to those who lived through it. I hope you love these performances as much as I do.n Williamson,  Denny and Thompson, and so on did at that time.<br /><br />I really envy you, fair reader, if you are discovering the original Fairport Convention for the first time.

B0009HLDFU|1.0|I suggest the new wheezer cd instead, it has more hooks in one song than this whole double cd. This one truely sucks. A double cd without one single hook. ugh, the sameness is brutal.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It's amazing that Coldplay keep producing the goods, I was expecting their 3rd album to be the start of the rot, with Chris Martin going off and doing the Hollywood thing and all that, but this album is just amazing. I saw them live at Glastonbury in 2003 and they blew me away, can't wait to see them here in Florida in September...
B000089CJI|1.0|I hurd the recording today. As I listened I Could feel it boring a hole deep into my soul. It truthfuly made me feel psycally sick in adition to draining all my mental strength. I felt as though i was about to die. It was just terrible sicking fodder of a cd. Don't buy it and if u listen to this terrible noise go get some punk rock and fight to change this world instead of crying about nothing.
B00005JMXX|5.0|I have to say that this film really reminded me of Armageddon.  Not in story or plot, but in the way that the movie can be so enjoyable and make little sense when it comes to science and common sense.  The movie is loosely based on the book THE COMING OF THE GLOBAL SUPERSTORM and concerns massive climate changes and how they affect life as we know it. <br /> <br />The movie begins on an ice shelf where a climatologist is taking core samples.  These samples combined with events on the shelf drive the scientist (Quaid) to hypothesize that a new ice age is in the near future unless we change our ways now.  To keep things movie, Quad is wrong on the time frame and things begin happening very quickly and drastically.  Like ID4, we follow a number of groups as they are affected by the events, especially Quaid and his almost estranged family. <br /> <br />Typical of this type of film, politics and politicians are painted as bad guys although some do come to their senses.  The action never lets up and the special effects are absolutely stunning.  There are a couple of deleted scenes on the disk that really help link a number of events better than they were in the final product, but the movie worked well without them. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of disaster films then this is one of the biggest you could see.  Check it out.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|This film is misunderstood- many say it's boring- however if you find it boring then you simply weren't the intended audience.  the intended audience is an audience that does not need instant gratification- an audience who can read under the surface and make finite connections once the picture is finished.  Why all the driving?  Why all the silence?  Why the motorcycle racing and nothing but the rev of its engine?  We find out this is his way of escaping reality- and the film is experimental in the way the scenes drone on- because it wants you to be enveloped in the same way he is- without thinking of anything else- just washing your thoughts away. The film is interactive in that sense.  People tuning in for another Buffalo 66 should turn away- This is completely different- much darker and more film than movie- with a trapdoor ending that I found to be one of the most haunting moments in film-  when Budd finally confronts the guilt that he was pushing away all along...

B000819PKC|3.0|This review will be part CD review and part concert review as i've just seen them last night in Budapest at their first gig of the summer. <br />The CD resembles a lot to 'A Funk Odyssey' which wouldn't necessarily be bad news, but the tracks are - in my opinion - less catchy and the jazzy moments have completely disappeared. I miss the horns of the first 3 albums and while the songs themselves are quality, i just couldn't find those little sounds, tone settings, groovy bass lines or smooth synth chords that made the other albums stand out. My favourite track is 'Seven days in Sunny June' which has some excellent moments, but overall, there aren't really any standout songs. <br />As for the concert yesterday, it was a smash with good sound settings and great atmosphere. Surprisingly, they played a lot from the earlier albums (without horns). Those of You who are lucky to have Jamiroquai pay a visit should expect the following (based on last night's set):Canned Heat, Space Cowboy, Cosmic Girl, Revolution, Little L., Mr. Moon, Blow My Mind (instr.), Too Young to Die, Emergency on Planet Earth, Feels Like It Should, Dynamite, Black Devil Car, Seven Days in Sunny June, Deeper Underground. <br />The songs from the new album sound better live than on the disc, which makes it even more worthwile to buy them tickets. <br /> <br />

He didn't canx the show--and EVERYONE showed up for a night of Blues Rock I know no one there has forgotten. Hearing these BBC disks brings it all back home. Rory always gave you his all..and he was all about the love of music and guitar in particular. That's something lacking today..artists like Rory--he never got rich or as famous as his talent should have made him--but he worked his ass off and poured his soul into every show and song he did. You just can't go wrong with this one!! Play on RORY!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|<br />maybe it isn't as punk as their other stuff for \\"american ideot' more than makes up for it with their powerful lyrics and in your face politics.  face it we needed a band to come out and state their opinions about our goverment in that way!  we've all been lied to repetedly and no one says anything or does anything. finally here comes green day, and they arn't afraid to talk about this stupid war or the failures of our leaders.   <br /> <br />not all the songs are political though.  there are heart felt ballads and just plain good rock songs.  this cd is a perfect mix of everything.  it is my 3rd favorite cd from 2004, and like i said above my fave green day effort. please pick this one up! if nothing else just do it to show that you don't have to make a rap or pop album to sell millions!  you can have a brain instead!
0060925000|5.0|Vikram Seth shows a self-deprecating sense of humour by putting a very fitting Voltaire quote at the beginning of the book: \\"The secret of being a bore is to say everything.\\" However, in my opinion this book is worth every one of its 1300-odd pages. As some other reviewers have said, it should interest anyone who likes either Indian history, Hindu/Muslim issues, or big family dramas, which should include a pretty large segment of the reading population. I personally got sucked into the love story before anything else, but as I read on I found myself drawn just as much into the other characters and their political, religious, or family concerns. I think it shows Seth's abilities as a writer that he can weave together such different themes in one huge narrative, give them all full attention, and have them turn into a cohesive whole. It ended up seeming very much like real life to me. In life the love story cannot form the be-all and end-all either, because job concerns or political situations or family troubles or even doubt about where we are going with our lives pop up and interfere.     The ending of the book, which other reviewers have questioned, seems appropriate to me (*warning- spoiler ahead!*). Yes, it goes against the traditional love story promised to us at the start, and I wanted to see Lata marry Kabir as much as anyone. But then again, I believe that part of this book's strength is that it reveals more than just the love story. Seth portrays Lata's family life and her inner life in such detail that we come to see the complexity of her decision. Could she really break with her family to marry the person she loves? Would she be happy? Seth's treatment of this dilemma shows a nuance and an understanding of how complicated human decisions can be. This seemed very valuable to me after reading many books that portray life and important decisions in terms of black and white, good and evil, unfair or fair. This book seems to subtly point out that the most interesting things in life happen in its grey areas, and just for that, I think it (literally) pulls its weight.
0316172324|4.0|This book is interesting although it is short and sometimes difficult to grasp entirely. I am still skeptical as to the accuracy of the statistics in this book. It seems that Gladwell is arguing (for the first half of the book) that answers jump out at you and that it is usually the correct answer. Then he says that the answers that come to us so quickly are influenced by our prejudices. Did anybody not already notice this about themselves and/or others? Although most of us already grasp the basic message of the book, I would still recommend reading it. It's able to put things together to make this penomenon easier to understand. Just don't plan on spending over 2 or 3 hours reading it.
0321334876|5.0|There is a reason why this book is in it's third edition. It's been great since the first edition. This latest edition is a complete update for the needs of the modern C++ programmer, including all of the newer elements of the STL, and commonly used extensions like Boost. <br /> <br />The addition of color in this edition is an excellent idea. The color quickly draws your attention to the portions of the code that are important to the narrative. It's something that I wish were in more technical books. All too often the important elements of the code are obscured in all of the infrastructure code which isn't critical to the technology being discussed. <br /> <br />A must own for any C++ programmer. And definitely worth the look if you have the first or second editions and are still actively programming C++.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|\\"Room on Fire\\" is not as great \\"Is this It\\", but, that being said, there isn't much else wrong with it.  Personally, The Strokes first CD is my all-time favorite (yeah, I'm serious), and if it was a 10 then this one is a 9, so it still ends up as being an amazon 5 stars.  Tracks 1-8 are uniformly excellent and almost as good as what's on the first CD.  The lyrics remain interesting if not profound.  \\"Room on Fire\\" is a foot tapper and I highly recommend it.
1932100385|1.0|The most comprehensive aspect of this book is the extent to which  T Colin Campbell misuses data to prop up the inflated health claims he makes for vegetarian, low-fat diets.  The implications are \\"startling\\" all right.  Fortunately, enough data is included so that those with a thorough grounding in statistics can figure this out.  Unfortunately, readers without the training or the motivation to do so and so will make dietary choices based on the author's dubious conclusions.
0375422889|5.0|As the sequel to the critically acclaimed \\"Persepolis,\\" 'The Return' traces the story of Marjane Satrapi's adolescent years spent wandering Vienna in hopes of beginning a new life in Europe before making her way back to Iran following a series of personal hardships. <br /> <br />Having found her time in Austria to be plagued by instability and lack of direction, Satrapi can no longer handle her lonely, miserable life and decides to go home to her loving family in Tehran. With the revolution having made steady headway since her departure for Europe, Marji finds a changed homeland that frustrates her even more with its ignorant laws based on religious decrees. Having lived for four years in a liberal democracy where civil liberties were expected and demanded by its citizenry, Satrapi has serious questions to ask herself about her future in a nation where an independent woman's identity and aspirations are \\"crushed by a government and a country's traditions.\\" <br /> <br />I was certainly glad to see that this sequel's quality was up to par with that of its predecessor, and doubt that anyone who has already read \\"Persepolis\\" will be able to resist themselves from finding out how this wonderful story continues.
B0000009S3|5.0|Hot Rats is another bigtime favorite of mine.  It's the natural predecessor to mostly instrumental album The Grand Wazoo.  However, the feel of Hot Rats does not evoke such strong jazz leanings as the Wazoo.  It most certainly has an improvised jazz influence, but the preponderance of straight-eighth note rock styles, harmony not usually associated with jazz, overdriven guitar, ostinato bass patterns, and entirely composed pieces give Hot Rats more of a rock-fusion texture, way before rock-fusion was really even invented.<br /><br /> Compared to his previous \\"solo\\" work, Lumpy Gravy, Hot Rats comes off as a more organic and accessible affair.  The genius of Lumpy Gravy lied in its jarring juxtaposition of dialogue, tape experiments, orchestral music, and melodic rock.  Hot Rats is propelled along by ingeniously composed works like \\"Peaches in Regalia\\" and \\"Little Umbrellas\\" and furiously improvised pieces like \\"Willie the Pimp\\" and \\"The Gumbo Variations\\".  The overall energy of the recording is fueled by the energetic and passionate execution of Zappa and the musicians he assembled.  There are few early recordings by Zappa that really capture the intensity of his solo chops as well as on Hot Rats, and even fewer where the musicians support him so effectively.<br /><br /> It is quite possible that this recording was monumental in many regards for Zappa.  In one regard, it may have opened up his eyes to the possibility of what could be accomplished with musicians that could keep up with his vision.  Although the original Mothers were key in Zappa's conceptual development, this may have been the recording that made him seriously contemplate life without them.  After all, it was not long after this that the faces of the Mothers began to change.  Perhaps he realized that he might not have to rely on tape experiments and expensive orchestral musicians to make a statement that was in line with his expanding vision.  Zappa's later guitar compositions like \\"Zoot Allures\\" could be seen as an extension of the work on Hot Rats.<br /><br /> Another noticeable step is the unique palette of sounds that comprise the soundscape of Hot Rats.  Buzzing synthesizers combine with soprano saxes and flutes, creating an consistent and identifiable atmosphere that pervades the album.  Careful listening reveals a pretty stunning display of some of Zappa's unconventional doubling practices.  In his A&E Biography (which every Zappa fan should write thier congressman to aquire), he attributes this expansion of sound to a prototypical 16-track recorder that took up an entire wall of the studio.<br /><br /> Hot Rats most certainly influenced the development of his subsequent instrumental recordings.  Although I have not heard Waka/Jawaka or Studio Tan, it seems that The Grand Wazoo and possibly the Orchestral Favorites recordings would not have developed as successfully as they did if Hot Rats had not been recorded.  His work as a composer and voice as a melodist are in full bloom, and as adventurous as Hot Rats is, it sets the foundation for even more adventurous works that eventually led to Jazz From Hell and the Yellow Shark.<br /><br /> I'd like to comment on his guitar playing, as well.  Some people have trouble digesting Frank's soloing.  In an improv class last summer, my jazz instructor advised me that to have a successful jazz solo, there has to be a certain amount of predictability.  The audience has to feel like their expectations are met 50% of the time to keep interest.  This can be done with melodic repetition, use of convention, varying of the melody, etc.  Frank does none of these things.  His train-of-thought soloing takes a certain amount of focus because he almost never repeats himself.  He expresses himself through more with melodic variation by way of rhythmic displacement, texture, and timbre.  Until the listener is willing to think in these terms, his solos may just seem like mindless noodling.  However, his expressiveness is absolutely apparent, especially on Hot Rats, where he really just plays his booty off.s is absolutely apparent, especially on Hot Rats, where he really just plays his booty off. <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Batman Begins, directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento), co-scripted by David Goyer (Blade Series), and starring Christian Bale, Michael Cain, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy and Morgan Freeman is the spectacular release of the year so far. While Star Wars had the great visuals, Batman brings the entire batcave. The visuals are great and yet more real, adding a plausible flavor. The acting is outstanding! The story is tight and for a movie 2 hours and 20 minutes, one wants more, never feeling it is too long.<br /><br />It is by far more superior to the other films. While I liked the Batman film by Burton, it has slow and silly moments, too many one liners, and actually is a Joker origins story. The other movies in the series, while satisfactory entertaining (well, not Batman and Robin), are not plot driven and too many characters take the center stage. This movie loaded with characters, support the story and one never feels that they have stolen the show from Batman.<br /><br />I'm not going into the plot, other reviewers have and one should just go see the movie/dvd. Supporting films like this one encourages Hollywood to produce films with strong stories and excellent direction. This is a big budget with an arts feel, and one begins to understand Batman/Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />To Batman purist (I consider myself one), this film should excel. Most true Bat fans know that in the Dark Knight's 60+ year history, he has had re-interpretations but has stayed in essence Batman. This film brings many of the different comic elements form Frank Miller, Jeph Loeb, Tim Sale to Dennis O'Neal.<br /><br />This film has a strong narrative which is why so many movie critics from Roger Ebert to Jeffery Lions have complemented this film. This is a film deserving of repeat showings. Batman takes flight and never slows down until justice is brought to Gotham - let's hope Warner Nros. makes a sequal.<br /><br />The second disk has plenty of extras and it is outlined in the form of a comic book.d it is outlined in the form of a comic book.  <br />
B00005QFE5|5.0|This is the kind of movie that Hollywood never makes, a movie with much quiet and solitude.  It is also the most nakedly beautiful depiction of longing that I have ever seen.  Ziyi Zhang  is just remarkable as the young woman who longs so without reservation, who stands by the road literally for years, come rain or snow, waiting for the man she loves to return.  The scenes with the elderly Zhao Di and her son are also very affecting.  Just a remarkable depiction of longing and hope and loyalty.
B0006L16N8|2.0|The songs all sound the same. If you like Radiohead or Coldplay's first albums you will like Keane's \\"Hopes and Fears\\" much better.
0156027321|5.0|I loved this book. I hadn't heard a thing about it but the front cover did indeed catch my eye, (I know there I go judging a book by its cover...) but I am gald I picked it up. It was a all night can't put it down, kind of book. I have insisted that everyone read it. It awakens the mind to new thoughts, ideas and magical places and people. It's one I want to read to my kids and take them to this fantastic world Pi lives in. A must read for everyone!!!
B000002BSG|5.0|The great thing about this Album is that although it is presumed more commercial, the majority of the Album fortunately has that elitist, non-commercial Vibe which gives the Album more credibility. <br /> <br />The Track \\"You are my world\\" sampled a bit off a track carried Funky Nassau\\" from the early 70's. <br />If Stevie Wonder is coming out with MOR tracks Post \\" I just called 2 say I love u\\" then it's a blessing that JKAY is around to pick up where Stevie left off, and create his own style. There are no duff JM Albums and this one is Brilliant. <br /> <br />I misunderstood JM at first after seeing them on Top of the pops performing a single from ...Space cowboys, I thought, he is going nowhere, and it would take a further 18 months before it made sense. <br /> <br />The Reason I started listing to JM was due to a piece of music from ...Space Cowboys, which sounded like   <br />Pearl and Dean \\"Da Da, Da Da, Da Da, Da Da, Da Da Da\\". Some Guy I worked with in 1995 kept playing this song over and over, so I ended up with a copy and never looked back. <br /> <br />Jkay does not conform and that is what makes JM successful. It is that self-belief that he has that makes their music worth listening to. <br /> <br />I was listening to lots of Stevie Wonder/Earth Wind and Fire and other 70's Music feeling like I was in a World of my own till JM came along. Now it is cool to be Retro. <br /> <br />It's not cool to be a JM Fan, but that is what I like the most, non-conformity. If none of you have heard Station to Station by David Bowie, get this as well, let JK know if he hasn't heard it either, Now there's a guy who leads the way in Non-conforming. <br />
B00080ZG10|4.0|This was a pretty good movie if you can overlook the in completely innaccurate timeline. Excellent subject matter though. Howard Hughes is definately one of the icons of the 20th century and most people don't realize the impact he had on current technology. Excellent special features as well.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|<br />I'm not one for TV much - my wife and I DVR a few shows each week, and ignore most of the trash that dominates the cable and airwaves. Sadly, this means we probably miss a few good shows out there. <br /> <br />Like this one. <br /> <br />I'm not a big Buffy or Angel fan (not one of the many Whedon devotees), so when this show came out, we kind of glossed over it. However, at the urging of a friend, we watched Disk 1 of this DVD. I was surprised at how good it was, at the depth of characterization, the richness of the universe and backstory, the interplay of the characters, the attention to detail, and the how uncontrived the various plot points are. As we watched further discs, I came to two conclusions about Firefly: 1) the storytelling is as masterful as anything I have ever seen and 2) the writers, producers and directors actually respect their audience.  <br /> <br />To date, I've already hooked a few other friends on the show. It has been a pretty standard recipe - get them to watch the first DVD, and the magic just happens. Even my wife (a fantasy genre fan, but not big on Sci Fi) loves the show. <br /> <br />As to the genre. This isn't the PC future of Star Trek. Its not the glitz and mysticism of Star Wars. Its not the doom and gloom view of new Battlestar Galatica. In many ways, it reaches far above and beyond the sci-fi genre, in a manner I have not seen before. It is not about space, it just takes place there.  <br /> <br />So, if you like intelligent, well-acted, well-directed, thought provoking television, you'll like this show. If not, you might want to look elsewhere. <br />
B00009UW0N|4.0|This is an absolute classic slasher movie and shall be remembered forever. It has some very suspensful moments and you'll just love it. This is actually believable and is one of the best horror movies ever. It's actually scary at times and has a good plot. Watch this and maybe the second one but the rest is trash.
B000007492|4.0|What an awesome concert ! The songs are great, the band members are perfect. Very good mix of songs by both leaders Rick Davies and Roger Hogdson. I saw both of them in concert and now I can live the magic between them back in the early 80s.  <br /> <br />Of course, essential hits are missing on this DVD : \\"Take the long way home, it's raining again, lover boy, and many more\\". But the choice and mix of the songs for the concert is very balance starting with the great and unique \\"Crazy\\". Also included are classicals like \\"Logical song\\", \\"Dreamer\\", \\"Breakfast in america\\" and \\"Good bye strangers\\". The interview footage (half before and half after the concert) is one of the greatest i've seen on a DVD even if it has a short playing time. Additional videos from less commercial songs are a great addition to the content of the DVD. The only problem is that we want to see more of these great artists who created a unique music style. They have so many great songs missing...
0060763280|5.0|I wonder how many of you negative naysayers actually attended Harv's Millionaire Mind Intensive seminar? For the price of his book $27.95 I and my guest were treated to a 3 day, 14 hour per day seminar setup in a grand hotel ballroom. So many people attended this specific event in Toronto that they had to set up a \\"spill-over\\" room which had a video feed into it. All in all I think 1420 or so people attended.  40 some odd hours of seminar for $15.00 a head. Totally unheard of. Seminars of this type and calibre go for at least $1000.00 per person as the norm.  All the people that I talked to there were amazed and blown away by the seminar AND the book. The seminar as a business networking opportunity alone would be worth more than $1000.00 I got at least 30 leads / people interested in my business.It is already putting money in my pocket.  Buy the book, read the book, and definitely don't miss the seminar !!!!!  It will change your life and your bank account.    BTW : Some of you naysayers are the type of people who probably write computer virii in your spare time.
B0000DC14V|5.0|How about putting both \\"One Eyed Jacks\\" and \\"The Apoloosa\\"(Stuck with three other non-westerns) together in all their \\"WIDESCREEN\\" spendor? Both of these great westerns have gotten what Rodney Dangerfield would always get, \\"No respect\\".
B00005JNTX|5.0|I would best describe this movie as cinematic chocalate. You might feel bad a ingesting it but you sure do it enjoy it while it's happening. I really enjoyed this movie becasue it was gritty and very true to it's graphic novel beginning. Also, I have to add that the sequence with Micky Rourke as Marv is probably the best 40 minutes of the movie. Definately worth purchasing.
B0006L16N8|1.0|This is supposed to be the best?, give me a break!, very limited cord structure and there is no life to their \\"music\\"! They sound like a very bad blend of Pink Floyd and the Moody Blues only with out the obivous talent these bands had. This \\"band\\" has no life to it's music, the same old sing song tiredness and dragging rythms, I can think of a minor band from the 70's that would blow coldplay's doors off, \\"Crabby Appleton\\" Check out Reckless Kelly if you want really good all round music of today.
B0006J28KU|4.0|Heat is a masterpiece starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, and Tom Sizemore. Al Pacino is a cop trying to nail De Niro and his gang of robbers who are robbing banks. Pacino and De Niro are absolutely brilliant with two powerhouse performances. It's a rare thing to see actors this good in 1 movie. That alone makes it worth watching but the movie itself is a classic. It has one of the best scenes of all time in which a bank robbery turns into an amazing shootout. Bullets fly everywhere and lots of cops die in this classic scene. The movie is very long actually but even though it seems very long at times, 90% of it flew by for me. The ending is good but what you will remember is that awesome shootout!<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 1/2 stars because of its length!
0679309411|4.0|This book was captivating both in written style and story.  I fell in love with the characters.  This book really stands out among a lot of other books I have read.  The author really won me over with keeping the story going in an interesting way.  Lovely!
B0006A9IVQ|2.0|... but of very poor quality. So bad that it makes me think of an illegal copy?!
0312330529|5.0|Mr Roberts's voluminous novel tells the story of one narrator who escaped from prison in Australia and travelled to Bombay on a false New Zealand passport. He doesn't devote much time talking about his criminal activities in his home country apart from stating that he used to rob banks and deal in drugs and then chose to abandon his wife and children for the life of a fugitive. Upon his arrival in the Indian capital, he met Prabaker Kharre, a loveable character who showed him round the city, particularly the areas rarely visited by mainstream tourists. At Leopold's, a bar where illegal business is conducted by many Indians and a few foreigners, the narrator was introduced to Karla Saaranen, a beautiful woman who is often the object of his thoughts throughout the novel due to the difficulty she has in feeling love for anyone. <br />As he settled down in Bombay, he learned to speak Marathi and Hindi and during the adventurous years he spent in the city he became acquainted with a whole array of characters and he became to be known as Lin, Linbaba or Shantaram. The most impressive passages in the novel are the narrator's visit to Prabaker's native village of Sunder, his work in the zhopadpatti slum, his experience with the monsoon and the cholera, his work for Abdel Khader Khan and the Bombay Mafia, his stays at the Arthur Road Prison and the Colaba lock-up and finally his fight for the mujaheddin cause in the mountains of Afghanistan. <br />Mr Roberts wonderfully shows both the generosity and the violence of the Indian people's character. The spirit of Bombay is rendered in splendid descriptions so that altogether this novel is thoroughly enjoyable to read.
B0006L16N8|2.0|This album was more disappointing than I can even explain.  To go from A Rush Of Blood To The Head to this just doesn't seem possible.  But I guess it is since it happened.  AROBTTH was a phenomenal album, I think most agree.  But in this album, there are 3 tracks I can even remember to be somewhat good: Fix You, Swallowed By The Sea, and Kingdom Come.  As for the rest, they're just kind of there. <br /> <br />Incredibly disappointing.
B00003CXSP|3.0|3 and 1/2 stars  I watched this film after reading the book. The book was average but not at all as good as the brilliant silence of the lambs. This movie was a big dissapointment to me because after watching the silence of the lambs, I expected another masterpiece. But, I was wrong. Red Dragon was actually much better than this also.   But, this movie isn't at all bad, it's a descent movie, better than a lot that I have seen, but after the two others in the series, it was a letdown. Hopkins was of course at his best, and Julliane Moore did well as a replacement for Foster, but Foster was still better. Gary Oldman was also very good as Mason Verger. Hannibal is loose in this film and Clarice Starling and the FBI are trying to hunt him down. Of course, there are many great scenes in this movie, but it fell short of amazing. The ending was very good though, and was much better than Harris's ending.   The difference between the silence of the lambs and this is that while the silence of th lambs is creepy because of the cinmatography, Jane Gumb's and Hannibal Lector's characters, and true suspense, this one repulses you by throwing horrifying and disturbing images on the screen. There's a big difference there as you can see.   If you liked the silence of the lambs, you'll like this, but you won't love it. But, it is a better movie than the book was. The book was more of a dissapointment, but this movie tried its hardest to turn an average book into a remarquable movie. It ended up being a little short of great, but ended up still being a good movie, that is recommended for fans of the series.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Not as good as their debut which had absolutely brilliant tracks like `Like a stone', `I am the highway', `Hypnotize' and my absolute favourite, the epic `Getaway car'.<br /><br />Chris Cornell has got a great voice; rich, powerful, beautiful!<br /><br />On first listen, I wasn't too impressed, sounded too much like the debut, and a bit same-y sounding. However, with repeated playing, the individuality and beauty of each track unfurled and the following songs have stood out as my favourites;<br /><br />`Be yourself'. Yes, it sounds a lot like `Like a stone' but it is a great upbeat rocker which grows on you. Great vocals!<br /><br />`Out of exile' which starts off with what is almost marching band drumming, then flows in to a rocker that is gentle and loud at different stages. Great!<br /><br />`Doesn't remind me', with its faint religious imagery, slight country feel, and slowish start building to a rocky chorus, is another song I've grown to like very much.<br /><br />`Man or animal' has a punk rock feel. Great drumming and guitars.<br /><br />Then there's `Yesterday to tomorrow', a brilliant mid tempo rocker, with some creepy sounding guitar, forlorn sounding vocals, and a great guitar solo. This, along with `Be yourself' are my two favourites.<br /><br />Other favourites are the rocker 'Dandelion' and '#1 zero' which starts off real gentle with creepy sounding guitar effects,  gets rockier about midway through, and featuring a blistering guitar solo. I don't know how they get the guitar to sound like that. Brilliant!<br /><br />Like I said, needs repeated plays to get into but still, a good CD.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|If you are tired of car-chase films or remakes of old TV series, this splendid movie may make you feel that there are still exciting films to be made. Master and Commander is the story of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and his men of the HMS Surprise in 1805, during the British-French war. His ship is searching for the French Acheron, a larger, more-heavily gunned warship. In a terrific scene at night in fog, a young midshipman senses something ahead, but isn't certain enough to sound an alarm. Suddenly, the French ship is upon them and all hell breaks loose. It is a true picture of combat, whether in 1805 or in Iraq today. These kinds of scenes of daily life and terrible fighting give a reality to this film - a reality that overwhelms you with its attention to detail. Russell Crowe does a splendid performance as Captain Aubrey - capable, dedicated, yet caring for his men. The film has bloody scenes, but not as bad as ER scenes on TV. And the courage of the wounded, old and very young, is moving. This is a superb film - well worth watching.
0800141660|5.0|This is a film about four women of class struggling to hold their lives together after losing their source of income.  They are suddenly subject to the cruel realities of their society.  The two older Dashwood sisters struggle to find a balance between love and security, fantasy and harsh reality.   <br />The emotions of each character are felt strongly, acted flawlessly, and thickly enjoyable. The language of the era is brought to life beautifully, and a clear sense of the societal expectations is easily made obvious.  Some period films have the ability to leave you confused about their characters' motivations, but not this one.  It is understandable, yet intricate. (As every great story should be).    <br />Every single aspect of this film is flawless. From the costumes, to the acting, to the sets, to the book to film adaptation, and on and on and on, it's all perfect.  And I make absolutely no hesitation in giving such unusually high praise.  This is one of the most cherished films in my collection.  I suggest that you give it a chance even if you don't like Jane Austen stories. It simply commands the highest respect of any film I've seen.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is by far Coldplay's most tangible and accessible album to date. Like one reviewer stated, they don't reinvent the wheel, it's not entirely new, but they play it smart. They keep it simple and let the music take you places. This is Coldplay at their best. This is their greatest effort in grand style. Chris Martin knows his voice and knows what he and the band are good at, what their known for. Instead of diving off the deep into some brave new world, they continue along in the same vain and direction of AROBTTH but with a lot of enhancements and improvements. \\"X&Y\\" is just an all around better album.
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson proved to the world in this movie that he is a very gifted man. He directed it and starred in it. This is rare to occur, and his work in this movie can be matched to Clint Eastwood's who often directs and stars in movies. This movie tells the tale of William Wallace played beautifully by Gibson, who adopted the scottish accent wonderfully who loses his loved one and wishes to avenge her. He leads a small army against a huge one and this movie ends up being absolutely fantastic. It shall remain one of the greatest war movies of all time due mainly to Gibson who put in lots of work in this movie. But, what makes no sense to me is that movies like Home Alone make more money than this gem. This movie should be one of the highest grossing movies of all time but America's audiences have proven that movies with very simple and stupid plots are more worthy than movies that report historical facts.  <br />Even if you don't like war movies, watch it alone for Gibson's performance as William Wallace, and for all of the effort that he put into this movie. This is my favorite war movie of all time and is one of my favorite movies of all time period.
B00004SZWD|5.0|This album is Stevie Wonder's Magnum opus; a delightful, intricate musical delight, which is still a powerful lesson in music today.<br /><br />Released way back in 1976, where it performed the (then) rare feat of debuting atop the Billboard 200 album charts. It spun off two hot 100 no.1 singles; the horn laden 40s big band sounding `Sir Duke', and the nostalgic, funky `I wish', as well as `As' and `Another star' which both made the top 40.<br /><br />It also won the Grammy for album of the year (Stevie's third win in that category) and three others: one for best male r&b vocal for 'I wish' best male pop vocal for the album, and best producer for Stevie.<br /><br />Not to talk of the cover versions and samples inspired by this album over the years: George Michael & Mary J Blige ('As'), Coolio ('Gangsta's Paradise' samples 'Pastime paradise'), Tevin Campbell ('Knocks me off my feet') Mary J Blige ('Time' samples `Pastime paradise') to name a few.<br /><br />Stevie Wonder paved the way for future soul vocal styling as utilized by people like Charlie Wilson (GAP band), Aaron Hall (Guy), Boys II men to name a few, and the Neo soul pack.<br /><br />What can I say about this masterpiece that hasn't been said already? I wouldn't call this just soul music. More than that, it's more of psychedelic soul, with sprinklings of jazz, rock and pop. With lyrics that touched on everything from love, life, death, war, sadness, and joy. Lyrics that were way ahead of their time, still relevant today.<br /><br />The delightful `Ebony eyes' has a faint Beatles feel to it. A real pop gem!<br /><br />`Saturn' is a pop epic with lyrics even more relevant today. It's about wanting to leave earth with all her troubles for a fantasy utopia on Saturn. Featuring lyrics like `'we have come here many times before/to find your strategy to peace is war/killing helpless men, women and children/that don't even know what they're dying for'. Are we sure it wasn't written for the world of today?<br /><br />`Another star' is a delightful upbeat, almost disco number with great `la la la la' backing vocals sweeping in and out, featuring excellent percussion, great horns, and guitar and backing vocals from George Benson.<br /><br />`Blackman' is a history lesson, teaching us about the accomplishments of the black man, as well as a few red, yellow and white people. The different peoples who made America.  Also featuring excellent percussion and darting horns, as well as a classroom segment towards the end. What a wonderful musical history lesson which still needs to be told this day.<br /><br />`Have a talk with God' is a gently bubbling psychedelic soul number, encouraging prayer to God when all seems lost and desolate. Beautiful musicianship, played entirely by Stevie himself.<br /><br />`Ngiculela - Es Una Historia - I Am Singing' is a delightful synthesized jazzy number which ends all too soon. Even jazzier is 'Summer soft'.<br /><br />`Love's in need of love today' begins with some choir like humming, which breaks into an inspiring but subdued ode to love. Anthemic vocals towards the end.<br /><br />`Village ghetto land' is a tale of life on the streets. Stark, icy synth strings and Stevie's passioned voice make up this brilliant song. `children play with rusted cans/sores cover their hands/politicians laugh and drink - drink to all demands'. Still so true.<br /><br />`Pastime paradise' is a wonder! Great synths, percussion, cutting strings, and intricate vocal layering, not to talk of the lyrics. `Proclamation/race relations...' I can't describe this song well enough. Fantastic!!!<br /><br />Then there's the two part `Ordinary pain', the second part sung by Shirley Brewer making for an interesting song. The instrumental `Contusion' which is a brilliant, upbeat fusion jam. The tender, instrumental harmonica laden `Easy Goin' Evening (My Mama's Call)'. The harmonica driven, sunny ode to his daughter `Isn't she lovely'. The beautiful, powerful testament to love called `As' which here, is the ultimate version. Again, intricate vocal layering and superb musicianship.<br /><br />What more can I say. This album was recently certified diamond for shipments of 10 million copies in the US alone.<br /><br />A classic which has stood well up to the test of time, almost 30 years on.say.

B00000I9MK|4.0|Hard to phathom how this little doozy got started. So some college kids from Glasgow got together to put to music some penned up material from aspiring poet Stuart Murdoch, and the result was a very limited edition of about 1,000 vinyl copies of what became known as \\"Tigermilk\\". Usually this stuff gets a B+ by the instructor, is listened to a few times by family members and close friends of the 'band', then gets forgotten, and the students graduate and get real jobs or something. Hah, well, sometimes in the vast sea of college projects rises to the surface a creation that doesn't go away...or refuses to go away, as the case may be. Like the \\"Blair Witch\\" phenomenom, this quiet, unassuming set of 10 songs caught a wave -- a tidal wave so-to-speak -- and for its first few years of its existence, was spread mostly through word of mouth (and then through music file sharing programs, at least until more copies went into print) at an alarming rate. Why is that? What makes this record so special?<br /><br />Well, start with the opening song, \\"The State I Am In\\". This song begins with a faye acapella and lots of atmosphere...just Murdoch and a quiet accoustic guitar. The voice is delicate, but gripping, and the lyrics offer an intriguing puzzle that sucks you in at once. You could swear it was Nick Drake singing from beyond the grave. It virtually insists that, if you are to listen, you are to give it your full and undivided attention. And slowly enough you realize, this guy has something really important to say...passively perhaps, almost without consequence...but you can't help but think this could be your younger sibling or best friend that is suddenly opening their heart and soul to you. For instance, \\"The priest in the booth had a photographic memory for all he had heard. He took all of my sins, and he wrote a pocket novel called The State That I Am In. So I gave myself to God. There was a pregnant pause before He said ok. Now I spend my day turning tables round in Marks & Spencer's, they don't seem to mind\\". Doesn't seem like much, but to hear it softly sung and accompanied by a lovely melody that builds gradually before reaching a peak, hovering delightfully at its apex over a truly gorgeous chorus...it is with one quick listen (or maybe it was two?) that it becomes apparent this isn't some fiviolous group of punks smashing irrelevant notes together in their basement, driving their parents insane. This IS something special.<br /><br />\\"Tigermilk\\" is bascially Stuart Murdoch's first solo album (ha ha). Sure, he has a backing accompaniment of five other band members who play various instruments and occassionally offer backing vocals and other contributions. But Murdoch writes, sings, and plays guitar in all ten tracks here...and that's a great thing really. His acute ideas for harmonizing stories of teen angst (\\"Expectations\\"), awkward character studies (\\"She's Losing It\\"), philosophical renderings (\\"I Could Be Dreaming\\") are obviously influenced from many different leanings (The Smiths, Field Mice, Love, Nick Drake, etc), but he combines them into a unique and refreshing approach that stands at odds with most contemporary music of its time -- mid-90s -- and at the same time inspires a host of twenty and thirty somethings...of all sorts of backgrounds...to hitch on for a ride into a world of escapism, perhaps even necessary isolationism. It is a big bad world out there after all, and where to go and seek shelter when you are a generation X'er (or Y'er), with all the expectations, pressures and sensory overload threatening to bury you under its weight? These guys know your anguish, certainly, and in turn offer you just the right recipe for sublime transcendental cravings. Listen to \\"I Could Be Dreaming\\" for instance...it has perhaps the most complex production of any song on the album, with instruments, mixings, and overdubs weaving a textured backdrop that fits seamlessly with the suggestive lyrics presented in a rambling, streamof conscious fashion so as to evoke our inner most desires -- those sames ones strangled by daily inhibitions, only to awaken during our reveries. (Why the song tails off into Isobel Campbell giving a recitation of several passages from the novel Rip Van Winkle, I have no idea, other than it's non-too-subtle tie into to the song's title, but it's loads of fun regardless). Or \\"We Rule The School\\", which contains excerpts from Panchebel's Canon, not to mention the most enchanting flute instrumental I've ever heard.<br /><br />All tracks here are extremely well done, and don't sound anything like what you would expect from a group of inexperienced music students. They're clever, inventive, familiar yet crisp and new all at once. As sad as some of the themes are, the tunes are decidedly uplifting and toe-tapping in a majority of the cases (just listen to the pop giddyness of \\"You're Just A Baby\\", or the soaring instrumentation and vocals behind \\"My Wandering Days Are Over\\"). Other notables include \\"I Don't Love Anyone\\", which is arguably the most punkish B&S ever got....that is to say, not very. But even with this light-hearted dabble into the world of adolescent rebellion, it's done in a fashion that's instantly recognizable and complete with a sing-along chorus that is reminiscent of some of the best pop from the 60's. The only real odd-ball tune on here is \\"Electronic Renaissance\\", which is a stab at early 80s techno/synth pop. Just what the point of this was I'm not sure, but as much as it kind of disrupts the flow of the album, in retrospect it is still a well done tune that is just as good as anything Duran Duran gave us (okay, maybe it's not on the same level as \\"The Reflex\\", but it manages to work nevertheless).<br /><br />Overall, a very impressive debut. The word-of-mouth success of Tigermilk thankfully led to the group's continuing efforts of translating Murdoch's songs and ideas into actual music. Who knew that their next project, after using more time to crispen the sound and further embellish the harmonies, would be one of the most memorable musical achievements of the last 15-20 years?conscious fashion so as to evoke our inner most desires -- those sames ones strangled by daily inhibitions, only to awaken during our reveries. (Why the song tails off into Isobel Campbell giving a recitation of several passages from the novel Rip Van Winkle, I have no idea, other than it's non-too-subtle tie into to the song's title, but it's loads of fun regardless). Or \\"We Rule The School\\", which contains excerpts from Panchebel's Canon, not to mention the most enchanting flute instrumental I've ever heard. <br /> <br />All tracks here are extremely well done, and don't sound anything like what you would expect from a group of inexperienced music students. They're clever, inventive, familiar yet crisp and new all at once. As sad as some of the themes are, the tunes are decidedly uplifting and toe-tapping in a majority of the cases (just listen to the pop giddyness of \\"You're Just A Baby\\", or the soaring instrumentation and vocals behind \\"My Wandering Days Are Over\\"). Other notables include \\"I Don't Love Anyone\\", which is arguably the most punkish B&S ever got....that is to say, not very. But even with this light-hearted dabble into the world of adolescent rebellion, it's done in a fashion that's instantly recognizable and complete with a sing-along chorus that is reminiscent of some of the best pop from the 60's. The only real odd-ball tune on here is \\"Electronic Renaissance\\", which is a stab at early 80s techno/synth pop. Just what the point of this was I'm not sure, but as much as it kind of disrupts the flow of the album, in retrospect it is still a well done tune that is just as good as anything Duran Duran gave us (okay, maybe it's not on the same level as \\"The Reflex\\", but it manages to work nevertheless). <br /> <br />Overall, a very impressive debut. The word-of-mouth success of Tigermilk thankfully led to the group's continuing efforts of translating Murdoch's songs and ideas into actual music. Who knew that their next project, after using more time tocrispen the sound and further embellish the harmonies, would be one of the most memorable musical achievements of the last 15-20 years?
0452282152|5.0|This is a quietly-disclosed love story. It is not a romance, except to the romantic-hearted reader. Instead, it tells of a bond between a maid (Griet) and painter (Vermeer), born of their shared understanding of beauty, one which remains unspoken for the most part.<br /><br />They are walled off from any relationship beyond their shared vision of art because of their daily necessities and burdens. There are too many differences between the way that a servant must notice daily needs, and the way that a master artist is often allowed to heartlessly overlook them, at cost to the servant rather than himself. In an even closer look, the difference goes beyond daily tasks to their family relationships. Griet's love for her family is often wrenching. She is not allowed as much as a single day with her dying sister for the sake of cleaning clothes and babysitting the children for her Mistress. Her Master's love and dependency on his family is softer, though its repercussions land hard on Griet.<br /><br />In the end, their relationship puzzles the heroine, because she sees deeply into Vermeer's heart through his art, but sees the rest of him at the distance of a maid. The book explores what such a relationship can offer and what it cannot offer, not with a penetrating glare, but with something that fits much better with this story. It readily shows Griet's alienation from her family, as both painfully present in her mind and painfully absent in her daily work. It holds an open eye for beauty, and an open eye to its cost as well, not allowing the proverbial blindness of love to cover over its glaring limitations.
B000065U1N|5.0|Based on the real atrocities that occured in Africa, in Somalia, Black Hawk Down directed by Ridley Scott tries to show these events. This is a masterpiece of a film but it is very gory and gruesome. This blood and brutality is used though to show reality. But, I don't think that I took to it well, because I went into a weird depression after seeing it. So, beware, this movie is disturbing as are most war movies.  <br />The acting is superb and the battle scenes are wonderfully made. The choppers/helicopters are also wonderfully shown.  <br />This is trully a remarquable movie but it's very disturbing. I reccomend it to anyone looking to watch a true war movie and that has a good stomach.
B00004YZFR|5.0|This film is one of the most disturbing and unnerving films ever released.  Not because of what it supposedly represents about the 60's and the hippy generation  but what it represents about our society as a whole.  If you watch closely its not just the Angels that are guilty here--there is a strong undercurrent of violence right from the get go--and the crowd is all too eager to participate.  Much of what we see is on the fly--meaning there isn't much social reflection (ie The Woodstock movie) basically the cameras do most of the talking and at times what is going on isn't clearly discernable.  It's real easy to blame the tragedy of Altamont on the Hells Angels--it's much harder to take a closer look at ourselves.  A must see.
B00006DEF9|5.0|It's been so long since I've last seen this movie that I'm not even sure that I ever HAVE seen in its entirety before because I can't recall any of it other than of course the titular dance sequence, which has been shown numerous times in excerpts. I often tend to make the mistake that anything I see or heard for the first time IS new so it was kinda pleasantly surprising to find that most of the musical numbers were reworkings of earlier hits from the earliest talking movie era during which this film takes place. <br /> <br />Even if I did see it before in its entirety then it was a pleasure to revisit it again just two days ago. I have only a few musicals in my collection but would like to get a lot more, especially other Gene Kelly titles, perhaps even Xanadu. It's just too bad that they don't make musicals like they used to, but I guess that's probably because there either isn't enough of an audience for them anymore or else the studios just THINK that there isn't. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is one of the all-time greatest musicals (and movies, period) that any self-respecting lover of musicals shouldn't be without. Highly recommended.
B00005JNJT|1.0|The music is bad, batman is stupid, the film is very very bad.
B0002B15WE|5.0|Of course, everyone has probably heard of this excellent film starring Bruce Willis. While there are 3 films in the series, this one is really the only one needed. The 2nd and 3rd are descent but not great films. Bruce Willis stars as John Mclaine who goes to a party which ends up being interrupted by a group of terrorists. Mclaine, the cop, obviously has to do something about this.  <br />This is the best action movie ever with some wickedly cool scenes. Bruce Willis proves that he is a great actor with some great lines (yipikaye mother f#$%^*) and when he curses at the lady at the police station on the phone because se thinks that it's a prank. This movie blows the Bond movies and all of the other action movies out of the dust and will remain the true great action movie, and the movie that trully jumpstarted Bruce Willis's career.
B000006TRV|5.0|To everyones taste? No. <br />Old fashioned and unlike anything made these days? Yes. <br />A superb album? To me and millions of others - yes, certainly. <br /> <br />For certain other 'reviewers' (and I'm stretching the term a lot here): <br />1) Since when does what MTV plays mean anything other than what's currently the fad? Can you spell (or understand) \\"narrow minded\\" and \\"childish\\"? <br />2) Since when do song lyrics have to be gramatically correct? (see MTV for examples) <br /> <br />Either give good reasons or stick to opinions rather than dreaming up rubbish reasons why you don't like something (this is purely my opinion - feel free to disagree)
B00005JMCW|5.0|I watched this, thinking \\"maybe it'll be kinda funny\\". Two hours later, I think I broke a world record for number of laughs per minute. I was amazed at every twist the plot made; none of the jokes or events were pat and predictable. Unless you are a grim, unsmiling businessman who cannot find the energy to even unwrinkle your brow, you will certainly find this DVD worth every penny. And who knows, even the aforementioned businessman may crack a smile.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|I grew up in the 1980s loving this movie, I wore out my VHS copy of it.  Being a film lover I have now moved on to DVD and I'm very disappointed that this film is STILL not being offered in widescreen.  They bothered to add a DTS soundtrack but still no widescreen???  Some of us like to watch movies as the director intended, not hacked apart in the full-screen editions.  So I still will not be buying this film, even though it is one of my all time favorites, until it is released in widescreen.
078324228X|5.0|This movie is based on reality in which the boxer Ruben Carter was wrongfully accused of murder. It shows how awful racism was and that makes one feel horrible. Just because Carter was black, he was imprisoned. This film is remarquable and Denzel Washington is absolutely fantastic as Ruben Carter. It shows his wrong accusation, the racism, and his descent into madness in prison. It's very sad but the ending ends out being a happy ending. Ruben Carter is helped by a group of Canadians who are inspired by his book that he had written and they try to help him get released from prison. It's a beautiful story and deserves to be watched by everyone. This movie is up there for me with films like the Shawnshank Redemption and the Green Mile! Highly reccomended!
1932907009|5.0|At times the universe seems divided into two groups:  those who want to write a movie script, and those who write books and articles telling how. <br />  <br />Blake Snyder, the experienced author of SAVE THE CAT!, falls into both groups -- he's a produced screenwriter, and he's written a nothing-held-back, insider's point-of-view, fabulously funny book about screenwriting. <br />  <br />Using examples of popular movies, Snyder offers sensible advice about creativity, story development using your brain and index cards, how to make the characters do their jobs, and -- best of all, what screenwriters want to know before they even write their screenplays -- how to market your masterpiece. <br />  <br />Every screenwriting instructor (and I don't play one on TV, I am one) should add SAVE THE CAT! to the students' required reading list, without hesitation.  This will be the book they actually read and follow.   <br />  <br />Snyder's writing style is smoother than the sprint to the stage to accept the Academy Award for best original screenplay.  Buy this book. <br />
B0001HAISG|3.0|Jeremy Sumpter plays the title role in \\"Peter Pan\\" this time, and does a credible job as the boy who wouldn't grow up (although he's no Robin Williams). Jason Isaacs plays Hook, and, although he's no Dustin Hoffman, he does adequately bring the villain to life. Ludavine Sagnier - who's no Julia Roberts - portrays Tinkerbell with a more mischievous bent than I was expecting. Richard Briers is underused as Smee, although he's no Bob Hoskins in any event. <br /> <br />The movie is directed by P.J. Hogan, who's no Steven Spielberg.
B00080ZG10|4.0|Howard Hughes was an eccentric businessman and adventure seeker who was always striving to create things and achieve things that were larger than life. This movie, \\"The Aviator\\" brings his life to the big screen and it's a movie that scores many hits for its cinematography and for the performances by its fine cast.<br /><br />Director Martin Scorsese is the man behind the camera in this film and, like with most of Scorsese's films, this movie can be counted on for plenty of symbolism, foreshadowing, etc. as the frames advance. Hughes love of flying is first in importance in this movie, but there are other components of his personality that are highlighted as well. One thing that is center to this film's plot is Hughes problem with obsessive- compulsive disorder. This came from his childhood and Scorsese makes this point obvious when he starts out the film; showing a young Howard Hughes as a boy, getting a bath from his mother, listening to her talking about the importance of cleanliness. This phobia to germs haunts Hughes throughout his life and the disorder (and the way Hughes handles it) is one of the main focal points of this film.<br /><br />Hughes was known for his flings with many leading Hollywood ladies and several of them make their way into this movie. Cate Blanchett is very good as Kathyrn Hepburn. She doesn't look like Hepburn but she has the accent and the mannerisms of Hepburn down to a science. Kate Beckinsale is also very good as the sultry and confident Eva Gardner. Another actress in this movie is Gwen Stefani in the part of actress Jean Harlow. She isn't quite as good as the other two, and she could probably have been replaced by someone better.<br /><br />I know there are many Leonardi DiCaprio fans out there who worship his every move, but parts of DiCaprio's performance are less than satisfactory. My main problem is DiCaprio's attempts to come across as a ladies man. He just doesn't have the spark with these women to pull it off and the chemistry isn't there. He is a little too innocent looking, for one thing. Later in the movie, DiCaprio grows a moustache (like Hughes did at the same point in his life) and he seems to fit the role of Hughes a little better. He looks more street- smart and serious as opposed to the boyish appearance he has for most of the film.<br /><br />The Aviator walked away with five Oscars and it ranks as one of 2004's better films. I don't think it was quite good enough to get the Best Picture award (and it didn't- the honor went to Million Dollar Baby), but it is still a very good film to watch. There is no coverage given to Hughes later years as a Las Vegas tycoon- only to his earlier years. But what you get to discover about Hughes is portrayed with a good degree (although not 100 percent) of accuracy, making it an educational and entertaining motion picture.ry isn't there.

B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie is fantastic! Uma Thurman, Vivica A Fox, Lucy Liu, and David Carradine all star in this strangely funny and awesome movie. The story is about revenge in which the bride (Uma Thurman) seeks revenge on Bill (David Carradine) and his gang after they killed her husband and left her for dead. She has her large sword and she's slicing nonstop. Tarantino also seems to add comedy to this, notably with the squirting of blood like a fountain. It may sound nasty but you have to see it to understand it. The martial art fights are awesome and shall be remembered forever. Believe me, after watching the movie in full, you'll rewatch the wicked figt scenes. I really don't know what to say to encourage you to watch this movie besides that it's just awesome! This unique movie is a lot better than the sequel but the sequel is also good.   It's also very neat when they switch to an animated form to show Lucy Liu's character's past. Believe me, this movie is absolutely amazing!  This flick has a great beat that you'll just have to get up and dance to. The movie is in plain words just tight. It's really funny (pu*&^ wagon!) and also has some of the coolest fight scenes. Funny enough, I loved this but hated Pulp Fiction. So go figure.
0060594888|4.0|Jack Canfield is a wildly successful and well-connected man, and he can't help but remind the reader of this fact in almost every chapter of this book.  However, I felt that he and Janet Switzer created this book with the best of intentions.  Of all of the leadership books I've read recently, this is the one with the most take-home, take-to-work practical advice.  All of what is presented here is common sense, yet it's written in such a way that it's easy to understand and apply to life--today.  I find myself going back to individual chapters as I seek guidance in particular areas.  There is also an extensive resource list.  If you can look past the references to Mr. Canfield's mansion in SoCal, I highly recommend this book.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is an absolute must for any breathing eagles fan. I thought Hell Freezes Over was the best until i saw this. It has the best sound you will have ever heard from a DVD. Buy it!
B000002P2V|5.0|Love them or hate them, this is probably the Who's best album.  This is a solid album throughout and you can clearly see Pete's influence.  His solo Album \\"Empty Glass\\" feels like is should be part of this ensemble.  It has the same feel.  When the Who was good, they were great.  Who Are You is no exception.  This is a CD that you can listen to again and again and again and not tire of.  Solid album from beginning to end.  If you are not a Who fan; try it.  If you already are; enjoy it.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|A masterpiece of a film that is very sad and depressing. AIDS is a serious issue and this movie shows the discrimination against people who have it, but also shows the pain that the love ones would go through. It shows how sad life can be and it makes me feel how lucky I am and how many peopel are. AIDS is very common in the US and this film beautifully portrays a story of an ordinary person that gets AIDS. The movie contains powerful performances by Tom Hanks and by Denzel Washington. It'as really great to see these wonderful actors in a great movie together. I recommend renting it because you really won't want to watch it a lot. Tears will probably flow from your face as it is one of the saddest movies of all time. Bruce Springsteen's song \\"streets of Philadelphia\\" also adds a lot to it as it is an absolute beautiful song.  <br />A masterpiece.
B00001ZULV|5.0|Great moving songs, some of this songs will mellow the thoughest girl. Seriouly, love it, girls will love this cd like toyota loves guys. Great collection of songs, buy it.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|first id like to say this is a really really good album, and its probably there best, and for the people saying dont buy it casue its copy protected, do you really think the band would want this, the foo fighters are one of the few bands that acutally dont care about downloading its the record companies who decide this and its always been like this so just buy the album
B00006879E|2.0|After listening to the first two songs on this cd, I had high hopes that this might be the first complete Cd that I had listened to in a long time.  Apparently this should have been an EP if they still make those.  Harder to Breath is certainly a catchy song but unfortunately the disk peaks on the first track.  After that, you are left wanting.  This is a frustrating CD.  After the first track you want the entensity to continue but it quickly fades away to some very forgettable tunes.
6305263248|5.0|A blast! Jean Reno and Robert De Niro star in this amazing action/thriller movie with the best car chases ever! <br />Even if you don't want to watch the movie itself (which is great), at least rent it to check out the wicked chases. They are trully umbelievable. The movie is about a group of hired people who have to retrieve a briefcase. The chase for the briefcase is AWESOME!!!!!! But, betrayal comes into play and the survivors are trying to finally retrieve this briefcase. 3/4 of the movie is action while the end has a thrilleresque approach. De Niro as always is fantastic and Jean Reno also does a good job. There's really nothing else to say besides that this movie is a must see alone for the chases and the movie itself, besides the chases, is even excellent. Beleive, you'll rewatch the chases after you watch the movie.
B000002HIK|5.0|In the world of Richard D. James, anything goes.  If you want to move into that old bank vault that's up for sale, feel free.  If you want to buy an old military tank and drive it around the country side, no problem.  If you want to make an album of entire ambient melodies with no beats that's over two hours long, go right ahead.  And if you want to blend elecronica, hip-hop, classical, and industrial music into one revolutionary album, while taking breaks to add samples of scissors clipping and tapping on pots and pans, please do so.  Such is what we've been given with the album ICBYD.   <br /> <br />ICBYD, in my opinion, is the absolute pinnacle of the Aphex Twin sound, rivaled only by SAWII and parts of Druqks.  All the tradmark elements of RDJ's music are present (at least the most crucial elements, that is), along with superb arrangements, fantastic classical instrumentations and plenty of dark, brooding undertones.  Other than the tracks Ventolin and COYS, the album is trully flawless, and at times mesmerising.  Mentally and emotionally stimulating, the album succeeds where SAWII failed in the way that it never gets sluggish and boring (not to take anything away from SAWII, which is itself very great).  From start to finish, the songs plung you into a sonic hypnosis of sorts, sending you from one end of the musical Aphex ocean to the next as you struggle to stay afloat on the waves.  Soothing, exiting, and even scary at times, the sound never fails.  This is THE sound of futuristic classical compositions, or at least I hope so.  Initially quite challenging, I admit, the album certainly isn't for everyone, especially hardcore elecronica/drill fans.  However, if you do feel up to the challenge, are looking for an album of music unlike anything else out there, and appreciate an artist with the ability to fuse old and new technologies into a trully mentally stimulating experience, then ICBYD is the album for you.
B00082IJ08|5.0|OK <br />Real brief because you are reading lots of these. Sweet album, new line for the Gorillaz post their self titled debut side matter. Portishead meets Beck style chill to it, some HHop overtones through out, great all around disc, many layers. ..sickest track ~ Every Planet We Reach Is Dead ~ <br />*****
B0002OERI0|4.0|It is so refreshing to listen to a disk with more than one potential hit on it.  Green Day reminds me of the Clash, especially the \\"London's Calling\\" album.  Both of these albums can be listened to over and over, each time findind something new.  Green Day has certainly hit their stride.  While all songs on this disk are not diamonds, it's worth the time to listen to the entirety of the cd to sift for the many gems.
6305508550|5.0|This is my all time favorite comedy. Believe me, it's abssolutley hilarious.  <br />Peter Gibbons goes to work at Unitech every day and works basically in a cubicle. His friends Michael and Sharim also work with him. Sharim has problems with the copier which he wants to throw out the window, Michael has problems because his name is the smae as a singer (Michael Bolton), and Peter has \\"a case of the mondays\\" and just wants to stop working. Their boss is one of the funniest characters with his awesome lines( yeah..... I'm gonna need you to come in tommorow..). Milton is also funny as he is a small nerdy man who isn't receiving a paycheck who is obsessed with his red stapler. The commotion over the stapler is absolutely hilarious! Then, when Peter's friends get layed off, they all join together to rob Unitech of its money even though Peter got a raise for \\"doing nothing\\"! (His boss hates him but the consultants love him) <br />Jennifer Aniston plays Peter's love but one of the funniest moments is when one employee gets hit by a car while driving to work. He gets insurance money and gets to retire. He then hosts a party saying how lucky he is even though he is in a wheelchair with both of his legs broken! Absolutely hilarious. I'm not going to give away any more of the millionssssss of jokes but I really reccomend this to anyone in the mood for some good laughs.
B000000OQF|5.0|Each genre of music has their \\"it\\" record.  one which not only defines the style of music but the personality and character of the time period in which it is created.  for grunge there's \\"nevermind\\" , for industrial there's \\"the downward spiral\\" and for hard rock there is \\"appetite for destruction\\". it is the album that both made and doomed Guns n' Roses.  it changed the face of rock music forever.   <br /> <br />each track on this magnificent album is gold.  they are all built on the raw, dirty life styleof late 1980s hollywood.  in a nut shell they are the 80s.  songs of love, sex, drugs, violence.  everything is here.  and it is REAL.  it's not like those bands that tried to immitate life.  Guns n' Roses did it.  these guys had lived in a world of extreme decadence and they were capitalizing big time on that era. <br /> <br />the unfortant aspect of making such a wonderous record is that it can never be equaled.  a record like this is based on a specific time and specific vibe.  it can never be repeated.  the music industry changes so fast and it's easy to get drowned by the latest trends.  very few bands can weather the storm of time.   guns n' roses ultimately failed.  they sold millions of records and will live forever as legends.  but all their subsequent records were pathetic in comparison.  and its not that those records were bad.  just when compared to Appetite they were of a lesser quality. <br /> <br />Appetite for Destruction is a classic masterpeice.  every rock fan should own this record.  it is a living testiment to an era of glitter and decadence. and will forever be remembered as one of the most powerful and influencial recordings of music history.
B000050XEI|5.0|I never listened to New Age music but was put on to it after seeing Enya perform on David Letterman many years ago. Her distinct style of vocal harmony and use of layered synthesis caught my attention. Could it be that what I was hearing was today's equivalent of a modern day,new-age pop Beethoven?    Well, if this is what angels sound like in heaven, I am going to like it there. This entire album is soothing and a joy to chill out with. The best tracks are the trademark \\"Only In Time\\", \\"A Day Without Rain\\" and what would make a wonderful movie soundtrack, \\"Tempus Vernum\\".    It's a nice change up to the noise coming out today. Stressed out at the office or dread coming home on that long commute? Having trouble falling asleep at night?     Get this album. Listen to this wonderful masterpiece of art because someone like this doesn't come along very often in our lifetime.
B00005JLKN|5.0|Red Dragon is my second favorite film from the Hannibal Lecter trilogy, the first being the silence of the lambs. This movie once again portrays Thomas Harris's novel which I just started reading. This is the first of the trilogy even though it was released last. This is when Hannibal Lecter is captured for the first time by William Graham played by Edward Norton. Anthony Hopkins is at his best while Harvey Keitel plays the best Jack Crawford yet. But of course, once in prison, Will Graham must interview Lecter, trying to find information on a new killer.  <br />Graham was on the verge of retiring when he decided to come back to the force. What's good about this movie is that it isn't disturbing like the other two, so a larger range of people could problably watch it.  <br />What distinguishes this one from the others is that you see the killer's battle against himself. Ralph Fiennes plays the killer with lots of force, and he tries to conquor himself and his anger. He basically does everything a painting tells him to do, but once he starts seeing a blind lady for whom he falls for, he tries to stop doing what he does.  <br />The movie has MANY amazing scenes and sequences and the conclusion makes your heart beat as much as the silence of the lambs did. It's not as good as the remarquable silence of the lambs, but saying that it's almost as good as it, that's pretty remarquable itself.
B0002OERI0|3.0|<br />the fact is this record would NOT have been popular is it weren't political.  many people only bought it to \\"say something\\", to stand up against the Republican party. well sorry, but just cause you protest a (and i'll admit it is stupid and pointless) war, doesn't mean you have a great album on your hands. <br /> <br />the singles make me sick, and not cause they're nessicarily bad...but they are played OVER AND OVER AND OVER again on the radio.  its enough to drive one mad, or at the very least make them loath the songs.   <br /> <br />all in all the record is decent.  some of the high lights are the \\"epic\\" songs, \\"jesus of suburbia\\" and \\"homecoming\\".  in between that there are alot of pointless songs that sound exactly the same.  i've never been a green day fan, but some of their prior attempts i would have given 4 stars.  this one really should be just 2.5 <br /> <br />what i think is stupid is that so many americans are complaining about the government.  if they hate their contry so much why don't they just leave?  the answer is simple; decent sells.  and going again the government is \\"cool\\".  thus green day is \\"cool\\".  but perhaps next time they should put more into the quality of their music and less into the message.
B00000DFSK|3.0|I agree with the reviewers that found this compilation to be lacking.  U2 is a wonderful band that almost always seems able to deliver the goods.  Many of their songs have that indescribable classic but catchy feel to them.  If only more of those songs were on this disc.  Don't get me wrong, I like much of what is on this disc, but I also wondered why a few songs never made an appearance. <br /> <br />I think this best of album is perfect for the casual U2 fan who doesn't want to spend the money on a few great radio hits mixed in with some unfamiliar ones.  Best of CD's certainly serve that purpose quite well.  In my case, my few U2 CD's got lost and scratched and I thought this an ok substitution.  And lucky for me, I am a pretty casual fan.  So, casual fans can't go wrong with this purchase.  Pride (In The Name of Love), Sunday Bloody Sunday, With or Without You, I Still Haven't found What I'm Looking For, Where The Streets Have No Name, and Desire are the highlights here.  Hardcore U2 fans probably already have most of their discs and therefore should maybe consider this one redundant.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This collection, despite the weakness of the 3rd one is necessary in every collection. The movies contain some of the best actors ever from Marlon Brando, to Al Pacino, to Robert De Niro, to Robert Duvall. These movies speaking about the mafia are true classics and listen to all of the reviews here. You shouldn't rent it, you must buy it. Although it does cost a good amount of $, it will be watched over and over again. The first two are gems anf the scene where Michael Corleone removes the gun from the bathroom to \\"take care of business\\", will always be in my head one of the best scenes of all time. <br />Watch it, watch it again, and remember it. Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is something that everyone will love.
B00008H2LB|3.0|to begin with, i have always had a heavy deslike for rap, nonetheless when Hybrid Theory came our i purchased it based on the singles i had heard and liked.  though that album was ok the whole rap influence seemed to overshadow the rock aspects.  thus i only sort of liked HT.  when meteora came out i wasn't even planning on wasting my money on it.  and in the end i didn't cause a friend burned it for me.  i gave it one listen (planning on being completely disappointed).  maybe its just cause i expected it to suck that i was so surprised, but i actually liked the record on my first listen. <br /> <br />i've thought about it for awhile and i believe the reason i disliked their first release and liek this one is that the hip hop influence seems toned down.  there are actually a few songs that don't have any rap.  and many of those that do only feature small sections of it.  the lyrics and vocal sound in general are much more real than HT.  for instance \\"breaking the habit\\" is a powerful ( rap free might i add) song that - though overplayed- is still one of my favourites.   <br /> <br />i only skip 1 song when i listen to this album, and that is \\"nobody's listening\\".  this song to me is simply dull and life less ( and as you probably guess from my prior comments, contains obnxious rap). <br /> <br />in all Meteora is a good solid rock album.  i wouldn't call it exceptional or a \\"must have\\".  but if you're a fan of the rap/rock movement or just looking for a solid 2004 release go ahead and pick it up
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer certainly gets ripped to threads, but admittedly he is good at producing mellow rock.  I think this CD is better than his second one.  It has more variety to it and just seems more polished overall.  No Such Thing, Why Georgia, and Your Body Is A Wonderland  are the most well-known tracks and they showcase his brand of rock.  Some other highlights are Neon, City Love, Not Myself, and Back To You.  Each song has a little different feel, but all are catchy nonetheless.  The use of strings and the organ compliment his laid-back style nicely. <br /> <br />His style and his voice is certainly not for everyone, but check him out of you like what you've heard from him on the radio.  His music is soothing and really good to relax to.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|this album is pure genius, just like in the last albums, hardly any of the lyrics make much sense, but in a way that only SOAD can get away with a make sound great. <br />i bought this album only really because i liked the previous stuff, so i knew i would like this, and i'm so glad i did. <br /> <br />i cant wait 'til hynotise comes out i WILL be getting it too. <br />(as far as i know it'll be out September 27th, i could be wrong though, my source wasn't as reliable as i'd like it to be)
B00003CXXP|4.0|This film starts with a fabulous premise: to give a child robot of the warm  behavior, being capable to substitute a real child. But then the script experiments a sudden twist that will lead to unexpected places of the imagination with a warm homage to Pinocchio, leaving behind the possibility of making a film of major caliber and conceptual rigor. You will find certainly some intersections with Blade Runner, but the tearful approach affected seriously the original proposal of Kubrick. You can argue the arresting special effects and the laughable presence of Jude Law who adds the film a second breath but with a script so sinuous and so lineal, in which the humans are cruel and merciless in the Flesh Tournament led the film to an evasion picture and not a dramatic crossroad that somehow would have reached a major status.<br /><br />Think for instance what would it have happened in case of being directed by Terry Gilliam of Ridley Scott, who had explored previously in these lands, with remarkable results.<br /><br />Spielberg wanted to recreate a film but the main fault is the excessive use and abuse of the romantic gaze who dilapidated the treasured message of the script. Too many vanished expectations when you make the final balance.
B00063MBU8|4.0|I saw Simple Plan at a large music festival recently and they have good stage presence.  Lots of energy has something to do with it, but solid, catchy music is the other piece to the puzzle.  I much prefer this CD to their first one.  They have matured, whine less, and talk about more sophisticated topics.  Take Crazy for example, when Pierre rants about the injustice and the rich/poor divide in this country.  This is a far cry from the song on their first CD where they yell about wanting everything for Christmas.  Yes, they were obviously being flippant, but their newfound maturity is clear regardless.   <br /> <br />They have definitely matured in the lyrics department as they've become more socially aware, but the maturity of their sound is less audible.  There is a bit of variety in song styles and this is why I say their sound has matured.  The song Untitled is a good example of a more mature Simple Plan.  This song definitely would not have been at home on their first disc. <br /> <br />If you like pop-punk and you like what you've heard of Simple Plan on the radio, check this one out.  Give a listen to Perfect World, Me Against The World, Crazy, and Untitled in particular.  There is nothing hugely deep or profound here but the subject matter is certainly more thought-provoking now and their sound is undeniably catchy.
6304981635|5.0|Do not search too much about a credible plot. All the pretended cover for chasing a criminal who deals with narcotics is a huge frame to show us one of the most admirable Kung Fu fighting in the story of the cinema.<br />The camera of Robert Clouse is under the stage planned by Bruce Lee. We will assist to a petrified island with an important footage in the first minutes where the master and Bruce Lee talks about the spiritual doctrines of the Kung Fu: interesting dialogue that pitifully is not longer. We will watch interesting duels with John Saxon, Jim Kelly and Bolo Yeung the same who fought in the first great feature of Van Damme sixteen years later Lee gives us the best of his discipline, with impressive domain of his flying attacks and the use of wood weapon.<br />The final combat between Hahn and Lee will be in the mirror hall, a great homage to Orson Welles' \\"The Lady of Shangai\\". However I must recognize the final climax in Chinese Connection is even superior.<br />The last opus of Bruce Lee who died on July 20 1973, just previous several days to the world Premiere. Well restoration process that allowed to observe the terrible shot of the mortal snake.<br />A cult movie from its instantaneous release!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has done it again.  They created a great album.  At first listen i thought it was an ok cd, but it was kind of too much of the same.  After multiple listens I realized that thats exactly what I was hoping for from Coldplay, more of the same.  Coldplay delivered exactly what I was hoping for.  X&Y is filled with wonderful songs.  Some standouts are \\"A Message,\\" \\"Till Kingdom Come,\\" and \\"X&Y.\\"  Im giving this cd 5 stars because it delivers exactly what I wanted.  More of my beloved Coldplay.
0152023984|5.0|I never knew that this kind of book really existed me growing up. It gives you the whole picture of how LIFE is all about through the eyes of \\"THE LITTLE PRINCE.\\" How grown-ups deal with a little boy who wants to learn lots of things on his young mind and most of the time he was brush aside because they thought he is really young to learn valuable lessons. It gives you the feeling that you're not alone on this world when it comes to solving problems, big or small. A must to own and read for all ages. It doesn't matter how young or old you are as long as you're living you never stop learning about LIFE.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Can't believe people aren't outraged by what is going on here. I have no interest in an artist or label who thinks we have no right to the data on a CD. With the high prices of CD's (despite pennies to make) this is ridiculous. BOYCOTT this and any copy protected disc!  If we continue to buy cd's that have this or a similar copy protection scheme, we will have a future of zero, restricted rights or additional fees to get the digital data    To all the consumers out there who insist this plays well on an Ipod/Itunes on a PC - let's hear your method because it is confirmed from Sunn (developer of the copy protection) that it cannot be done:    THis CD WILL NOT rip into an Ipod (on a PC) without bits of data missing.  If you downlaod from the CD to your hard drive and import the same bits of data are missing. The company who developed the technology is trying to extort $'s from Apple.  As a consumer I want the ability to rip into my digital library with the encoder of my choice (Itunes - it makes a difference) at the bit rate of my choice (up to an exact digital duplicate - AIFF). Look at the suggestion from Sunn on how to get it into Itunes (direct from there Tech Support):    Please follow the instructions below in order to move your content into iTunes and onto an iPod:     If you have a Mac computer you can copy the songs using your iTunes Player as you would normally do.    If you have a PC place the CD into your computer and allow the CD to automatically start. If the CD does not automatically start, open your Windows Explorer, locate the drive letter for your CD drive and double-click on the LaunchCD.exe file located on your CD.     Once the application has been launched and the End User License Agreement has been accepted, you can click the Copy Songs button on the top menu.    Follow the instructions to copy the secure Windows Media Files (WMA) to your PC. Make a note of where you are copying the songs to, you will need to get to these secure Windows Media Files in the next steps.     Once the WMA files are on your PC you can open and listen to the songs with Windows Media Player 9.0 or higher. You may also play them in any compatible player that can play secure Windows Media files, such as MusicMatch, RealPlayer, and Winamp, but it will require that you obtain a license to do so. To obtain this license, from the Welcome Screen of the user interface, click on the link below the album art that says If your music does not play in your preferred player, click here. Follow the instructions to download the alternate license.    Using Windows Media Player only, you can then burn the songs to a CD.  Please note that in order to burn the files, you need to upgrade to or already have Windows Media Player 9 or greater.    Once the CD has been burned, place the copied CD back into your computer and open iTunes. iTunes can now rip the songs as you would a normal CD.     Please note an easier and more acceptable solution requires cooperation from Apple, who we have already reached out to in hopes of addressing this issue. To help speed this effort, we ask that you use the following link to contact Apple and ask them to provide a solution that would easily allow you to move content from protected CDs into iTunes or onto your iPod rather than having to go through the additional steps above.

B000002GOZ|4.0|\\"Unplugged\\" sessions are pretty tell-tale. Mediocre songs and mediocre musicians are mercilessly revealed, but good songs work even in the most-stripped down arrangement.     Apparently Bryan Adams is a pretty good songwriter, even if his lyrics are filled with klichs. His 1984 classic \\"Summer Of '69\\" works extremely well in this setting, and stripped down versions of \\"Heaven\\" and \\"Cuts Like a Knife\\" prove that Adams is a resourceful straightahead rocker with a knack for a hook.   There are five songs from Adams' then-new album here, 1996's \\"18 'til I Die\\". \\"Let's Make A Night To Remember\\" and the slightly forced \\"The Only Thing That Look Good On Me Is You\\" are significantly better in this acoustic setting, and \\"I Think About You\\" is transformed into a driving folkish rocker a la John Hiatt. \\"18 'til I Die\\" is burdened with too many strings, though, and the ballad \\"I'll Always Be Right There\\" is a little bit run-of-the-mill and a little too saccharine for my taste, but hey...it's all a question of taste.    \\"MTV Unplugged\\" is also good for a few surprises, like the early  \\"Fits Ya Good\\" and four new songs. The solid, melodic rockers \\"A Little Love\\" and \\"Back To You\\" are among the highlights of the album, as is the bluesy \\"If Ya Wanna Be Bad Ya Gotta Be Good\\".  There are many ballads here, and I would have liked to hear a couple more up-tempo songs and less of that string orchestra. But Adams is backed by a group of very good musicians, and there are plenty of fine moments.   The overall quality of the music makes \\"MTV Unplugged\\" one of his best efforts of the '90s.
0452286379|5.0|This is a thick book.  I don't mean pagewise because I've read longer.  Thick meaning that careful patient attention should be taken when reading.  That is the writing style.  \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a quick read as much as it's a book about 20th century architecture.<br /><br />First off, I must say I'm surprised by the average review of 4/5 stars by 829 previous reviewers.  The only way I could see giving this book a marred marking from perfect is Ayn Rand's using the profession of architecture as a vehicle to spew her philosophy.  But spewing is the wrong word as it has negative connotation.  And this reason, this fronting I've described is too coincidental.  The message of her philosophy being individualistic creation and achievement, a self-fulfilling achievement of Miss Rand of having done so through the publishing of \\"The Fountainhead\\".  Or perhaps she recieves lower marks from \\"second-handers\\" or real life Peter Keating's and Ellsworth Toohey's whose lives are mirrored in the pages.  Oh well.  What do I care?  It's not a crime against me.  Perhaps these people would've enjoyed \\"The Gallant Gallstone\\" better.<br /><br />Patient character evolution is done with brilliance and the book spans somewhere between 20-25 years of the characters lives.  The story parallels the careers of Peter Keating and Howard Roark.  Rand shows the difference between two working philosophies.  One is riding the coat-tails of predecessors, the easier route (in her opinion), the office politics of how you look in other people's eyes, the country club.  Soon enough, the reader finds that this first example is pawn to an elaborate control scheme that society constructs.  The premise is that no one man should have egotistical power, a premise formed by people not willing to create or put themselves on the line, a premise by those who are too afraid to change.  The other is the power of the individual, the one who cares not for the folly of other men but who sees holiness only in the process of personal creation.  Criticism and backlash mean nothing, because they add nothing.  This is existential self, exterior forces put to the wayside, the heart of the philosophy.<br /><br />I can understand this a hard book for some people to read.  Not difficult to get through, but difficult to accept.  People don't want to view their careers as worthless, and in my opinion, no person is worthless.  We do get that sense of Peter Keating and even Gail Wynand to some extent.  Men who could've been.  It's sad and sometimes hard to bear, I suppose.  In some respects it reminds me of Thoreau's preaching.<br /><br />Yet I love the delicate care Ayn Rand put into \\"The Fountainhead\\".  Descriptions of creation are among the best, IE The Stoddard Temple.  The reader gets a feeling of the power shared among Howard, Dominique, Steve, and Mike.  It's a beautiful part of the book that I love and feel.  The difference of the two ideals described above are so clear-cut among different characters, which are developed with such care that the reader can easily make distinction between both forms.<br /><br />It really is a beautiful five bean thick chili of a novel.ness only in the process of personal creation.

B0009IW88A|4.0|The suggestion that Hans Zimmer would join James Newton Howard in a new musical treatment of the Batman saga in \\"Batman Begins\\" has had a wide variety of film buffs on the edge of their seats for months.  The good news is that most of them are quite pleased with the music and the film.  Now some less that ecstatic comments.  There have already been complaints that there is no singular \\"Batman Theme\\" in the Danny Elfman tradition; and that is partially true.  And some comments have, expectedly, drawn comparisons to earlier scores:  \\"King Arthur\\" for Zimmer, and \\"Unbreakable\\" for Howard; and there some similarities at times.  First off, there are an abundance of themes here, but they are somewhat subtle.  The composers rely a good deal on motifs and atmospherics, but there are themes here as well.  There is a beautiful soft theme that reflects on a life lost, and the possibilty that it may yet be saved in a romantic angle.  And there is a \\"Batman theme\\" of sorts here, although it is more of a signature that comes with the flurry of dark bat wings...but it is there and it is dramatic, distinctive, and quite memorable.  Overall, the music fits this film like specially designed black glove.  Sure Zimmer has taken some things from \\"King Arthur\\" and Howard's softer themes do bring \\"Unbreakable\\" to mind, but is that at all bad?  Too much of this score is original to dwell on these comparisons though.  And the music works as a soundtrack as well. The album is nicely produced by Warners, but there is one bit that is too clever by half...the titling of the cues with the Latin names of bat species is indeed clever, but it tells us nothing about the particular scenes in focus.  This has already been a Spring and Summer of film music treats, and the score for \\"Batman Begins\\" by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is a worthy part of it.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I think it's tragic.  How can Coldplay, in such a short career, become no better then the rest of radio-gimmick radio bands recycling their biggest hits.  C'mon people, there is nothing new on this album, it is completely recycled material.  I expected WAY more from these guys.  True, I just saw them live on T.V. and Chris Martin thoroughly annoyed me to tears with his horrible stage precense, so maybe I have a little annomosity left over from that.  But really, this album is lacking and I think most people that rate this album high probably have a narrow view of music.  Sorry, I dont mean to insult you, but do you mean to insult me?  It's frustrating how generic music has become.  If you want to play it safe, go get Ok Computer or even the Doves disk, or this guy down the street named Tom Foolery can even play for you....  whatever, this sucks.
0393317552|4.0|Diamond is a researcher. He spent the first part of his career studying birds in New Guinea. This led him to consider why he is visiting New Guinea, rather than New Guineans visiting him. He does the best job I've ever heard of, of comparing the course of nations, but the work could have been done better. He presents his thesis twice (I'm guessing, because presenting it once would've left the book too short). The detailed examination of grain sizes and nutrition, the suitability of indigenous animals, all he covers, could be better coverd by a cultural anthropologist, but no such person had ever tried before, and none has since. These other reviewers eloquently note the shortcomings of Mr Diamond's efforts. Apparently no one has any sense that they can do better, and that, to me, is quite a puzzle.
B00008S2VG|5.0|In 2005 Madonna will turn 47,and instead of heading to Vegas for a one-venue multiple concert affair,she's spawning more children's books and is announcing an all-dance album for this november,adding a tour for 2006(she will be ...48!!!).This woman has me in awe, decades of criticism and she's still going strong. <br />Now, onto this album:I have never been more attached to a Madonna CD as I have been to this one,I take each of its songs as a particular entity, and though I got my favorites,each track has its own:Love profusion is cute all over,American Life( if you associate it with the video she released along with the song back in march 2003) gives us a Madonna that still looks at you in a sort of feline fashion while spitting somewhat aggressive lyrics, Hollywood stays more in your mind after that fun kiss used it as background music in august 2003 at the VMA's. <br />And that's just the singles that got videos of their own; Nobody Knows Me & Mother And Father are frenetic dance songs with lyrics that don't stuck with typical  I want you's ..I love you's..etc etc..; Nothing Fails is a legitimate anthem, and Easy Ride is a ballad that spurts an orchestral climax after a couple of minutes in. <br />I admire this album very much, and for 2 years I have been listening to it as to no other album in recent memory,very recommended, beautiful and vital from track 01 to track 11. <br />I can't wait till november to check out Madonna's newborn! <br />
B00000JXVK|5.0|From what I have read, not many of the reviewers saw this movie when it was first released. I did. I saw it at the Drive-In about 8-10 time, yes Drive-In Movies. I've seen it about.... 30 times, atleast. It remains fresh and new. I remember these guys, guess I've dated myself.  <br /> <br />In short if you die not having seen this film, well, sorry about that. You die.
B0002IU988|4.0|This is a terrific album. I thought it sounded a lot like Creed at first, but I had to remind myself that there are 3 Creed ex-band members in Alter Bridge after all. This is Creed with a better singer and a band that can let loose. Mark Tremonti was always terrific in Creed but he can really express himself at will here, and what a terrific job he does. He is absolutely complete as a guitarist. His rhythym is so original and crazy while tasteful. His leads are terrific and what a treat it is to hear him play them. The whole band is playing with such abandon and passion. I agree with the other reviewers claiming that Scott Stapp was holding the band back a fair bit in terms of creativity and feel. You can really get a sense of that when listening to this album. I agree that there are one or two songs on here that are not that great, but the playing is still phenomenal. I cannot stop playing this CD. It is so heavy, melodic, original, and beautiful. I loved Creed, but I like this better. Highly recommended.

B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman Begins is EVERYTHING that was the wrong with the previous series of Batman movies. It is dark. It is gritty. It has emotion and heart...  and most importantly, it rediscovers the DETECTIVE in Bruce Wayne aka Batman... something the original series COMPLETELY FORGOT and replaced with Hollywoodish one liners and sillyness.<br /><br />BATMAN BEGINS takes the time to show you the man behind the mask. Why he became Batman? How the Batcave came about. It's exciting watching all the things unfold. The suit. The mask. The Batmobile. The wings. The grappling hooks. The story behind Alfred (Excellently played by Michael Caine). The back story behind the relationship between the future Commissioner Gordon who is now Detective Gordon.<br /><br />Replaced is all the cartoony, goofy settings and bad guys and inserted is a dark gloomy world that lends to the reason why Bruce Wayne does what he does. Crime and corruption have gutted Gotham city from the inside out and he's on a mission to change the citys future.<br /><br />The new Batman is not as KID friendly as the original series... but that is what I love about it. I'm not a kid anymore, and to be quite honest, I would have loved this as a kid anyway.<br /><br />The Scarecrow is PHENOMINAL. Frightening scenes where he rears his ugly head. Tormenting the minds of his victims. Superb effects that made me say \\"Awesome\\" outloud in the theatre (not loud though... just enough where my girlfriend could hear me).<br /><br />The only things I could possibly say negatively: Some of the fight scenes were hard to tell what was happening, because of the way it was shot (Too close), and even though I loved the early scenes in the movie, the setup, the introduction, the stories behind the mask and his tools... The movie was much more interesting once Bruce Wayne began to dawn the mask and fight crime... which wasn't till halfway or so.<br /><br />Although this little catch has me wanting more when the credits roll because the movie ended in way that made me wish they were already shooting the second installment of the Batman series.<br /><br />Which I can gladly say... HAS BEEN SAVED!!!!!!!the movie ended in way that made me wish they were already shooting the second installment of the Batman series. <br /> <br />Which I can gladly say... HAS BEEN SAVED!!!!!!!

When Louis Gerstner asked his mainframe team to drop prices and drop them hard, he was barely 45 days into the company - and the finance folks gulped hard.    The new CEO was certainly not taking the easy way out. What would follow would be documented in history as one of the greatest turnarounds in the technology business. In his autobiography this brilliant man, son of a milk truck driver shows us how his company rose from the verge of extinction to the pinnacle of the industry.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I loved Coldplay's first album...I loved 'Clocks' even though the second album wasn't exactly a great leap forward in my opinion...HOWEVER, Coldplay seems to think that recycling the same sound with progressively crappier lyrics is going to work forever and ever. The massive promotion of this album spoke volumes in my opinion because anyone who feels they need to become media whores like Coldplay did before this release are not pushing a quality product.    Some suggestions:    The White Stripes, \\"Get Behind me Satan\\" (4.5/5) This is a quirky, but infectiously good sounding record.    Nine Inch Nails, \\"With Teeth\\" (5/5) This is not The Downward Spiral and not even close to The Fragile, but this is a really good record with one of the best concluding 5 minutes of music I've heard in a while.     Dredg, \\"El Cielo\\" (4.5/5) Who?? Exactly, just check this out and you'll understand completely. The production value of this album is absolutely seamless.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Like most people, I once liked Britney Spears. I remember hearing \\"Baby one more time\\" and thinking it was the greatest song ever. But seriously folks, it wasn't that great. It was a shallow song that heavily relied on computers. But at least back then she had an excuse. It was her first album and she was only 17. <br /> <br />Now Britney is 23, and has released 3 other albums. You'd think her music would get better, but it hasn't. It has declined. Declined very steeply. Her vocals are whiny and weak, when they should have improved. The song \\"Me against the Music\\" with Madonna isn't really a song. It just a techno-ish beat in the background with some talking. And not to mention that there is /no/ chemistry whatsoever. They are just singing, there is no emotion. <br /> <br />Same goes for all the songs. There is just no feeling! The song \\"Toxic\\" is a great example of this. In a word, the song is about, you guessed it- sex. The vocals are whiny and annoying with a whiny and annoying synth line. The description of \\"Toxic\\", basically goes for all the other songs. Except one.  <br /> <br />The only half-decent song on the CD is \\"Everytime\\". The lyrics are actually meaningful, and the vox aren't as whiny as the other ones. But if you want a /good/ piano ballad, then check out \\"Restless\\" by Within Temptation. <br /> <br />*drum roll* <br /> <br />Now I will answer the *BIG* question. Why is Britney had so much staying power? That's easy- scandals. Whether it be making out with Madonna, getting married for 50 hours, or marrying someone she's only known for 2 months, and then making a reality show out of it, the media has continued to show interest in her. So she keeps selling albums. <br /> <br />If you want to hear some *GOOD* female artists, then check out these: <br />Lacuna Coil- Comalies (Cristina Scabbia) <br />Nightwish- Oceanborn (Tarja Turunen) <br />Theatre of Tragedy- Aegis (Liv Kristine) <br />Within Temptation- Enter (Sharon Den Adel) <br />After Forever- Invisible Circles (Floor Jansen) <br /> <br />Brit Brit's album, \\"In the Zone\\" tells a story about a girl who threw herself away, and her \\"Could have been\\" musical talent. <br /> <br />How sad! <br />
1573226521|5.0|The beach by Alex Garland  is a novel in which we can  find many references to modern culture, that is subcultures such as  new age travellers and generation x. <br />This is the story of a young man, called Richard who is looking for a real adventure and new emotions in his life. He is a proper representative of travellers because he just only wants to escape from reality and also wants to live in a fantasy world. When he arrives to Bangkok ,he meets Mr Daffy Duck who gives him a map in order that Richard finds the beach. Then, he meets two French people with who he decides to go and have and adventure, going to the beach. <br />In this novel we find an ideal, utopian society where people  <br />live and do whatever they want to do. Even though they want to escape from society and the establishment, they end behaving like a very organized society and having a leader who is called Sal and also having all the problems that we can find in western society, sometimes, it seems like Sal is a sort of dictator. All the people who live in that commune have to work in order for that society to function. <br />Although they live in a paradise far from western civilisation, in the novel they do not leave behind some of the amenities that they have at home, for instance they like to play gameboy, read some comics, such as \\"Tin Tin\\" and things like that. <br />Another cultural and historical references that I found very interesting were Vietnam War, Richard seems to have a sort of obsession with it, and the \\"Tet\\" which is the new year's celebration in Vietnam. <br />I think this novel is very rich in content; especially cultural references make us understand how society behaves and is evolving. This is one of the best books I have ever read, because it is very exciting and has some unexpected events that keep us reading! If you want to know more about it, please read it, you will enjoy it! <br /> <br />   <br />
B00009MGGI|5.0|One of the Best political films around, Ian Richardson is at the top of his game. If you like something that is very intelligent, cynical and entirely believeable about the ruling class of Great Britain well then go no further.Well done to all hands involved!
0385472951|1.0|This is one of the worst John Grisham's books and is the worst I've ever come across....Maybe it's because i don't like bad endings, but this is horribly unacceptable.
B0006J28KU|5.0|One of the best crime movies I have seen in a long time. Right up there with Good Fellas and the Godfather. A film that shows both sides of the conflict and does not glorify what is in fact  a battle of wits with your personal life falling apart at the same time. This Film just shows what happens when you get a great story and let it ride. Couple it with an outstanding cast, great photography, direction, scene location and a just wonderful music backup & it can't help but kick butt. A job well done to all hands!
B000002NCW|4.0|This is a good all-instrumental album from a master instrumentalist. I have many M.O. albums and this one gets its fair share of play with the rest. It starts strong with a few very hummable traditional celtic tunes nicely rendered. It continues with some of the same and a few that are not so memorable but that don't make me want to turn on something else either. <br /> <br />The final song is quite long and I haven't decided if I like it yet, but with M.O. that doesn't mean it's bad. I have often come to love most the songs I took the longest to like, so after 10 listenings the jury is still out on that one. <br /> <br />Overall this is good Celtic and Celtic-influenced music that won't hurt your ears if you like that sort of thing. If it suffers from any real flaw it is a loss of momentum toward the end of the album, but none of it makes for bad listening.  I like the Chieftains, the Afrocelts, Lorreena McKennitt and others and I regard this as a good fit with my tastes. Celtic done well just works for me, so this gets four stars.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Few words for describe latest great Album from Coldplay X&Y,this 3rd work consacrate their talent.<br /><br />I like very much the tracks 1,2,3,4,5 and 7,quite cinematic,and for what concerm my ideas about music I can say their kind of sound and music seems tell Sigur Ros meet Simple Minds.
B000002KKS|4.0|When Black Sabbath started all the way back in 1969, they were without a doubt THE heavy metal band.  Their eponymous debut, along with \\"Paranoid,\\" \\"Master of Reality,\\" and \\"Volume 4,\\" were all metal landmarks, and they all helped to forge and refine the genre.  Then came \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" and \\"Sabotage,\\" which, while not fully matching their predecessors, still proved to be fantastic metal albums that broadened the horizons of many headbangers across the globe.  It seemed that Sabbath were here to stay, fit to rule the realms of metal for many years to come.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.  \\"Technical Ecsatsy\\" and \\"Never Say Die!\\" proved that not only must all good things come to an end, but also how bad things could actually get.  Shortly after these releases, long-time singer Ozzy Osbourne left the band to pursue a solo career.  This seemed like the end for Sabbath.  But then, out of the blue, former Elf frontman Ronnie James Dio entered the picture.  Although many doubted that Sabbath could come anywhere close to their former glory, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" verified that they were back with a vengeance.  From the fast-paced opening riff of \\"Neon Knights,\\" it was evident that these guys meant business.  Although it was not as heavy on the \\"gloom and doom\\" themings of old, the new direction the band had taken was widely embraced by listeners everywhere, who were very eager to get a taste of the \\"new\\" Black Sabbath.  Still, some turned a deaf ear to the new sound of Sabbath, believing it to be too \\"pop\\" for their taste.  Others simply could not picture the band without Ozzy, as most of their loyalty had departed along with him.  Truth be told, I was one of these people.  For some reason, I just found it hard to picture the first true metal band without the frontman who had made them so popular.  Sure, Iommi's throbbing, sizzling riffs were still there; and the ever-strong rhythm section of Butler and Ward was still intact, but there was no Ozzy, and I couldnot accept that.  Instead, I tried to live in the past, listening only to Sabbath's first six albums and ignoring any and all praise I heard about this CD.  Eventually, though, I decided that maybe I was being a little too close-minded.  I had heard many rave reviews of this release, and though I tried to avoid most of them, I finally gave in and bought the album.  As I said before, you could tell it was a no-nonsense, yet relatively lighter release simply by listening to the first song.  \\"Neon Knights\\" quickly became a favorite of mine, and remains one to this day.  Next up came \\"Children of the Sea,\\" a song that starts with a peaceful acoustic intro and features some of the greatest vocals on any Sabbath song I've heard (Osbourne or Dio).  A great trade-off between heaviness and melody occurs in this song, and it too is one of my favorites.  \\"Lady Evil\\" once again goes into the fast-paced territory explored by \\"Neon Knights,\\" but this time the rewards are not as great.  It's a good song, just not a very good one.  Up fourth is the epic title track, the song that really shows how good Sabbath could be, even without Ozzy as their singer.  I just cannot say how awesome this song is, and if you haven't heard, you are really missing out to say the least.  \\"Wishing Well,\\" is another pretty good song, but it's really outshone by many others on this album.  Next comes \\"Die Young,\\" which I feel is the overlooked gem on this CD.  It features great guitar work from Iommi, as well as powerful singing by Dio.  Another classic.  \\"Walk Away\\" is decent, but I consider it to be more of a filler song than anything else.  Last up is \\"Lonely Is the Word,\\" another standout song featuring some of Tony Iommi's best soloing to date.  This is one of the best songs on the CD, which despite being lighter than some prefer, finally gives Tony Iommi a good amount of time in the spotlight.  Overall, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is a strong comeback for Black Sabbath, and though it does not quite match \\"Paranoid\\" or \\"Master of Reality,\\" it comes much closer than the band's last two Osbourne-era releases.  If you don't own this CD because you think it won't be as heavy as Sabbath's early stuff, then I can only say that I think you should take a chance on it.  On the other hand, if you don't have this CD because you think that Black Sabbath without Ozzy is inherently total garbage, then open your mind for one minute and get this album.  I did it, and I can whole-heartedly say that I am not at all disappointed with my buy.
1401206905|5.0|This story first came out back in 1988 in standard comic format.  Frank Miller had just done the Dark Knight Returns a couple of years earlier and returned to Batman for this series although he turned the art chores over to Dave Mazzuchelli who produced a very noir-ish look to it, much like Miller's Sin City.  At the time I wasn't crazy about the more stylized art but I've come to appreciate it now in the 17 years since.<br /><br />As the title suggests the story revolves around Batman's troubled first year as Batman and how The death of his Parents drove Bruce Wayne to take on the Batman persona and fight crime in Gotham.  His early attempts were failures as he was thought a worse criminal than even those he sought to bring to justice.  This is not the confident, even cocky Batman we know today as he is very much trying to find his way.<br /><br />As interesting as this is, it's Miller's story involving a young cop Jim Gordon that is really enthralling and detailing his early days, going up against corrpution in the police force as well as his early relationship with Batman.  Gordon is at first assigned to bring this costumed vigilante in no matter what it takes.  The two eventually come to a meeting of the minds and Gordon would generally begin looking the other way knowing what Batman was really all about.<br /><br />Miller also takes a crack at re-defining Catwoman and putting forth the idea that it was Batman who influenced her to get out of prostitution and take up burglary as a new profession.<br /><br />The book is very dark.  Heavily inked and washed out colors.  Certainly not like many of today's blind your eyes with color comics.  This is one that still holds up well all these years later and helped cement Frank Miller as one of the greatest writers in comics.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This is the best movie that was made this year. HAs a great cast. It is not just one movie, more like 3 stories in one. Bruce willis is as always a tough badass. Mickey Rourke made his come back. He did a great job playing Marv. A criminal who is in love with Goldie who was killed, therefore he tries to find who killed her. Bruce willis is an old cop who tries to save a young girl. Even after many years when this girl was in danger, he still tries to help her out. Clive owen is the next big thing. He did a great job. He tries to help a waitress and goes after a guy who was bothering her. the guy will end up dying, but it is found that he is a cop and many problems bagin from then onwards. All the three stories are well done and unite at one point, because it s a Sin City and all the crazy things are happening there. Totally would suggest to every one to go and check it out!!!
B00097DX3U|3.0|I LOVED their first album, so maybe my expectations were too high, but after reading all of the many glowing reviews, I was excited to get their follow up album, \\"Out of Exile\\"; unfortunately, after having listened to the album now two full times through, my initial excitement has turned into disappointment.  While there are several songs that I like, the album as a whole lacked the consistency of their first effort, and I frankly find a couple of the songs to be down right terrible.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Hilarious!! This movie had me on the floor from the first few minutes watching. Stephen Chow's latest movie is his best yet. This movie is one of the funniest movies that I have recently seen. It is a lot of laughing, mixed with Martial arts. The movie is very funny in its own way. It was made as a spoof of many famous holywood movies. there are cenes from WEstern movies, some action, they even spoofed The Martix. One more thing is that the movie is about gangster trying to collect money from a small town. The town seems to be very different from others. All the residents of town, know martial arts and have some special skills. Check it out. you will love it!!!
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is one of The Beatles' finest work. The songs are mezmorizing and cultivated. I love the album. It's one of my favorite albums of all time.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|If you loved David Grohl's self titled Foo Fighters, and The Color and the Shape, you will not find this album very entertaining. Disc 1 is the \\"Hot\\" side, and every track sounds the same as the last. Same goes for the 2nd \\"Cold\\" disc, which is an attempt at playing acoustic. This is only my opinion, but I listen to the Foo Fighters for their rock/grunge riffs, and the flow of their albums (The Color and the Shape is a great album to listen all the way through, and it feels complete at the end) but In Your Honor has absolutely no flow. Grohl says that this is the best Foo album. Unless you want a pop/arena rock album that goes almost country at the end, you will hate this album. I could barely listen to this one all the way through. What a dissapointment after One By One's awesome comeback.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|You've got to hand it to Nightwish.  Five albums in less than a decade, three of which went multi-platinum in various European countries, with all the constant touring in-between.  They've definitely paid the cost to be where they are today, the most successful act in Finland.  Once is their fifth and best-selling album yet, released on Nuclear Blast in Europe and Roadrunner in the States (I'm not too sure of the actual number of copies sold, but if Century Child could rack up a million in a day then I'm scared to know how this one turned out).  Once is also Nightwish's first record to utilize a full symphonic orchestra, making it their most epic-sounding release yet! <br /> <br />We begin with \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\", a dark and heavy piece with an unforgettable chorus coupled by some very raw riffs (it's evident that Emppu has down-tuned his guitar even more since the last album).  Following this is \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\", which has its moments, but is unfortunately bogged down by useless techno beats and Marco's screaming vocals, which are usually good, but tend to be something of a nuisance on this particular song.  If this is Nightwish gone nu-metal then it's not entirely bad, but I hope they do not continue to pursue this musical direction.  On the positive side, this is the only weak track to be found.  The international smash hit \\"Nemo\\" follows, and Tarja's voice will blow you away, especially during the chorus (which is quite similar to Century Child's \\"Ever Dream\\" now that I think about it).  Our first full taste of the orchestra comes in place at track 4, \\"Planet Hell\\".  This song possesses what may very well be some of Nightwish's most well-written vocal lines yet.  Tarja and Marco complement each other nicely on this track, and the orchestral parts are amazing.  Every song thereafter is great, but if I were to pick highlights I would say the dramatic \\"Dead Gardens\\", the (strangely) thrashy headbanger \\"Romanticide\\", the epic \\"Ghost Love Score\\" (by far thealbum's highlight, once again including great orchestral parts) and the romantic \\"White Night Fantasy\\" (a strange song found only on the US release).   <br /> <br />Basically, Once is yet another album that doesn't fail to impress.  If \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\" were doctored up, and if some of the lyrics had been rewritten (specifically getting rid of the frequent \\"ain't\\"'s) then it would be perfect.  But it still comes close.  While Oceanborn remains my favorite album, I'll make room in my CD plaer for Once any day. <br /> <br />10/10
B000002J1Y|5.0|Yes live...what can I say, this is the best album I have. For Yes fans there is nothing I can add, but for new listeners this is the best place to start to get a feel for this great band. <br /> <br />The live version of Close to the Edge is the ultimate song, is the best of this album and the best of Yes, at least to me. Nevertheless, the whole album is a prog gem. <br /> <br />Most of the best songs from the early years of the band are in this twofold album, I wouldn't change a thing. Wait a minute, maybe the sound could have been better, but it sounds good enough. If I could I would give this album 10 stars, but it gets 5 since it is the limit. Enjoy!

B0000060NF|5.0|The 70's were unarguably the truest point in time for soul music. Motown got a big hit when Marvin Gaye put soul on a new plateau, mainly because he put his entire soul to this golden piece. Throughout his whole career, he tried to find a balance between spirituality and sexuality; on \\"What's Going On\\", he found spritual enlightenment in order to tell what has been going on with him, from his brother returning home, changed from the bloodshed of the Vietnam war (a senseless war that took so many innocent lives), living with the hostile realities of America's inner cities, the future of the planet, and his relationship with both his natural father and his spiritual father. This was Marvin Gaye's most monumental accomplishment and took soul music to new levels, and artists such as Curtis Mayfield took it further. Whether you are living good or barely living you should listen to this.
0399236201|3.0|This book was an ok book. It had some exciting parts but, the plot seemed to drag on and on. This book is about a boy named Alex, who has an uncle that is a spy but he doesn't know it. One day his uncle dies and Alex has to take over the mission. He isn't that talented at it but he has to anyway. All of the gadgets he uses are based around kids so that was interesting. His mission is to try and figure out what is wrong with these people who are creating computers and giving them away, something seems fishy with it. In the end he makes it without dyeing. This book does have it's high points and I suggest that you read it, if you are just looking for a light book to read when your bored.

B0009NSE1K|5.0|I've listened to this thing about 5 or 6 times today.  Great stuff.  My favorite song is easily \\"Gullah\\", a song they opened their Asheville, NC show with (even better live).  Amazing how these guys continue to put out great stuff on their own terms, not to mention how much they tour.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|Foo Fighters have finally evolved into a solid working band rather than a Dave Grohl project with a few pals, and all four members seem to have been working on solidifying their sound and mastering their basic approach. They've done that here, though with hardly an exciting moment. There are a lot of skills on display here, but little vision. Based on their prior achievements, especially on the more exciting Colour & Shape and One By One albums, Foo Fighters currently sound exactly like you would expect them to sound, with no unpleasant surprises. Sadly, there are no pleasant surprises either. The rock disc here does offer a couple of winners, such as the hugely anthemic title track and the lowdown rumbling groove of \\"Free Me.\\" But otherwise we have a disc full of dependable but predictable Foo rock, with trite working class rock lyrics that don't get much deeper than the clich&eacute;d song titles.<br /><br />The acoustic disc offers reasonably believable exercises in sensitive songwriting, but this endeavor has lost something in the execution. The acoustic tracks are mostly pleasant but unremarkable singer-songwriter meditations with little of the indirect heaviness or noisy emotion that hard rockers are capable of when they go unplugged. There is some interest in the vaguely haunting \\"Over and Out\\" and the country-rockish \\"Cold Day in the Sun.\\" But a gaggle of guest stars fail to spruce up most of these snoozers, not even Josh Homme or the mighty John Paul Jones. The low point is the lazily exotic duet with Norah Jones, \\"Virginia Moon,\\" which probably seemed like a good idea at the time but just became embarrassing on disc. With this release, Foo Fighters have certainly become more dependable, but they've also become predictable and boring. Now that they've nailed down their basic strategy, it's time to do something more interesting with it. [~doomsdayer520~]

B0007VCZ50|5.0|Whatever the motivations may have been behind this 1985 film concerning Sting's somewhat self-concious transition from spiky-haired posterboy for the 80's New Wave scene to Serious Jazz Artiste, the fact remains that it is one of the better rockumentaries out there. Director Michael Apted delivers an ultra-slick production  with an \\"A+\\" grade in the cinematography, editing and sound departments as we follow Sting and his crack back up band (ex-Weather Report, Miles Davis players) rehearsing in a French chateau for a \\"debut\\" performance in Paris. Most of the material is from the outstanding \\"Dream Of The Blue Turtles\\" album (which Sting has yet to match since-this WAS his artistic peak, IMHO). There are some \\"oh so precious\\" moments-especially a sequence depicting a \\"goofy\\" photo-shoot in Paris, with Sting being chased through public squares (and most embarassingly, a public fountain-what, suddenly he's Anita Ekberg in \\"La Dolce Vita\\"? ) by a hyper little weasel wielding a camera and wearing a fez, who I really wished to see drop-kicked into the Seine. My favorite \\"Spinal Tap\\" moment: Sting's dictatorial manager (Miles Copeland, former Police svengali and founder/president of IRS Records) goes off on a set designer for her \\"lack of imagination\\" on what he perceives to be a drab and dismal stage look for the Big Show, against which she admirably stands her ground and testily retorts that Sting had told her he WANTED a \\"Brechtian effect\\". (You couldn't write something that funny.) The tardy yet belated release of the film on DVD should satisfy rock doc collectors with its excellent sonics,sparkling transfer and bonus videos from the period.
1402581386|5.0|I found the concept of this book refreshing. A serial killer who only kills serial killers. I loved the way Dexter talked in the first person, it help to understand what he was thinking and why, plus providing more than a few chuckles along the way.  The only disappointment I had was not finding another  <br />Dexter book.  I hope Jeffry Lindsay lets us hear from Dexter soon.  <br />
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I have followed the music of Dream Theater from the beginning, and although I do not agree with \\"pete sakes\\" delivery, I also think that this is a better album than Train of Thought due to the fact that they are taking risks and tweeking (orchestra) their songwriting abilities. They have really matured as songwriters (and producers!). Although as a Prog Rock guitar lover, I think that the songs on this album (CD) stand on their own. There are spaces that may seem unbearable (\\"I hate it\\") but their are very few albums that do not have any. Images and Words is one of those albums. But people and music progress (get it?) and ultimately achieve their desired goal for that momement. I enjoy this album constantly. It has a mix of melodies, \\"shredding\\", epic tones, and political views. Considering all the trash that is out there I am thankful that these guys are still working at the craft they love; they are honest about it. <br />My favorite track is \\"Panic Attack\\", which has a perfect balance: somewhere in between a butterfly and a tank!  <br />\\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is also spiced nicely around the moaning chorus.  <br />\\"Octavarium\\" is a very Pink Floyish type of production with dashes of early Styx mixed in for fun. The acoustic is tasteful and even melancholy. I was pleased to finally hear an B3ish sound. Somebody please inform \\"pete'sake\\" that there is guitar in the first (admittedly long) four minutes.  <br />\\"I Walk Beside You\\" reminds me of a couple of Van Halen Riffs and the song is overall good. <br />Dream Theater is not like other bands mentioned. The sustain originality, power and Melody, something lacking in today's music average consumer saturated market. Kudos to the boys!!!!
B00005JMAH|5.0|The third Harry Potter movie The Prisoner of Azkaban goes darker in tone and still retains that magical touch that made Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets box office gold despite the absence of Chris Columbus. At first what would seem like an unlikely choice, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n brings a hitherto unseen depth to the third movie, and ultimately makes this more satisfying than Chamber of Secrets. Despite not really knowing everything about the back story (I only saw the first movies on a whim and read only one of the books) I really thought that Azkaban was the best of the three. Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith and David Thewlis are fantastic in their respective roles, and while Daniel Radcliffe may be getting a little old for the role of Potter, he gives a more subtle, tempered performance this time round. The story provides for some great excitement, especially whenever the Dementors are on screen. Which brings us to ILM's fantastic SFX. Whereas Philosopher's Stone had some second-rate effects, all the creases have been ironed out to provide some stunning effects, particularly Harry's Hippogrif ride and the Quidditch match. John Williams outdoes himself, with a soaring, majestic score that encapsulates the spirit of the movie. For someone who will always be a LOTR fan, I really enjoyed this movie. Harry Potter is great entertainment for all ages. The DVD has great extras, including deleted scenes, interviews with the cast and crew, featurettes on the making of the film, trailers and DVD-ROM material. A great movie and an impressive digital package. Highly Recommended.
B0000TB01Y|1.0|I never reviewed this cast recording before?  Hmm, guess I didn't think it was worth my time.  Seriously.  Wicked does absolutely NOTHING for me.  There are like eight songs that I listened to it more than once (though Defying Gravity finds itself on my playlist quite often)   <br /> <br />Wicked is basically a mess of mediocre and so-generic-it-hurts showtunes.  Every song in it reminds me of another (better) song from another musical.  The most obvious of these would be all of the Wizard's songs.  Every song he sing reminds me of Amos Hart from \\"Chicago.\\"  I'm almost beginning to think that Amos IS the Wizard!  I can't even listen to the Wizard's songs because, not only are they boring and insipid (at least \\"Chicago\\" had the jazziness to get by), they are BLATANT RIPOFFS. <br /> <br />When it isn't stealing songs from other shows, \\"Wicked\\" is filling the obligatory song cues.  None of the songs feature any characterization whatsoever.  If you took out all of the crazy Oz references, you could insert the songs into any situation and it would be dandy.  There is one that tries its hardest, Dancing Through Life, but it is so dumb that it hurts.  The worst offender is the love song, As Long as You're Mine, which was completely random.   <br /> <br />A lot of the songs just plain don't belong in the show.  I already mentioned the love song, but there is also \\"For Good\\" which I agree DOES seem to want to be like \\"Who Will Love Me As I Am?\\" from \\"Side Show.\\"  A lot of Glinda's songs were really unnecessary too.  It's like Schwartz had a checklist of what types of songs he needed in the show, and just went down the line.  Here's the thing, Schwartz, you of all people should know that musicals have to show story and character through song.  \\"Wicked\\" doesn't do this. <br /> <br />Its songs aren't the only failure.  The whole storyline is absolutely awful. If you watch \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and keep \\"Wicked\\" in mind, you will realize how little the plots go together.  Have theyeven seen the movie?  Another thing I found dumb was the whole romance with Fyero.  Umm... okay, Elphaba is an intelligent girl who has had difficulties from day one.  Why in the heck would she fall in love with a guy who has it incredibly easy and doesn't even bother with any effort?  It's like Homer Simpson and Frank Grimes!  Okay, so say Fiyero's changed... there is absolutely NO indication of that whatsoever.   <br /> <br />My other problem with \\"Wicked\\" is that it really doesn't show why Elphaba turned evil.  There is one song that attempts to delve into her psyche (No Good Deed); when isn't that supposed to be the whole point of the show?  And that song has a pretty poor excuse.  She goes from being this incredibly good, well-intentioned girl to this evil chick who sets her supposed-lover on fire (watch the movie!)  It's too drastic for me, and one song isn't enough to explain that.  Also, in their attempt to round out a 2-d villain, they just created another: the Wizard.  Now I think I need to write a book/musical explaining why the Wizard's this evil tyrant! <br /> <br />\\"Wicked\\" is insanely popular and is kind of like the new \\"RENT\\" (another horribly overrated show.)  It seems to try really hard to appeal to teenage girls, which is probably why it's so popular.  But its portrayal of social problems like that is about as deep as a bad teen movie.  There was nothing REMOTELY likable about Glinda, even when she befriended Elphaba.  I think that the writers went out of their way to make Elphaba the only decent character in the whole thing.  It's incredibly unrealistic, and I'm not referring to the whole munchkins and talking animals. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, Schwartz has done some fine work.  I love \\"Godspell\\" and I even like his Disney soundtracks (though \\"Pocahontas\\" was a little preachy.)  But when I saw his whining about how he didn't get the Tony, I just shook my head because I'd finally gotten around to listening to \\"Avenue Q,\\" and there is absolutely no question about why that did so well.  There have been arguable injustices with the Tony's in the past (\\"Lion King\\" winning over \\"Ragtime,\\"; even this year's Spamalot winning over \\"The Light in the Piazza\\") but that is not one of them.  <br /> <br />In short, there are better shows out there.  I'd advise saving your money until you find one.   <br />
B0006U4UAU|4.0|source: [...] <br /> <br />FINALLY, after countless singles, remixes and production duties, LCD Soundsystem's (aka DFA boss James Murphy) debut has arrived! This is the album that may revive dance music. In fact as an ironic statement to all those hipsters who like dance music, the album kicks off with `Daft Punk is Playing at my House'. A premier slice of offbeat robofunk. <br /> <br />   <br />The best thing with this debut is that it never descends into the cliches that electronic music tends to fall into. For starters the majority of these tracks are `proper' songs with verses and choruses. The other thing is that James Murphy does a lot of vocals and his voice is quite similar to The Fall's Mark E Smith - especially on the standout `On Repeat'. Although the majority of the songs are epic grooveouts, the listener will NEVER tire out and for some strange reason the adrenalin increases as the song progresses in its unconventional way. <br />I can hear Liquid Liquid, Konk and The Bloods in this debut so you can say that this album has its roots (New York dance), but it goes verge into new territories. The most inventive one is the italian house closer \\"Great Release'. The fact that a guy who creates punk-funk one minute then something so euphoric the next shows a remarkable talent. <br />Being the generous soul he is, LCD Soundsystem has included a bonus disc with his early singles such as `Losing my Edge' and `Beat Connection' (although the `crass' version of `Yeah' is my fave tune), and is being traded for very silly money. <br />So will this album do the job and set music aflame? To tell the truth I dont think so BUT it will set new standards to the genre and that will have positive outcomes. <br />  <br />
B000002G8L|5.0|I normally hate live albums because songs typically tend to be rushed and watered down in concerts.  This album,my favorite Clapton collection,is neither of those things.   <br /> <br />Though I liked the album in its entirety, my two favorite tracks were After Midnight and, especially, the long version of Cocaine.  The guitar solo in Cocaine is still electrifying after all these years, especially the part where he injected a bit of a Japanese samisen feel to it (This album was recorded in Tokyo). <br /> <br />Like some of the other reviewers, I've worn out several copies of this album.
B00013RC9I|5.0|I was very surprised to find out that Talkie Walkie has the lowest rating on Amazon out of the few main Air albums.  A lot of people seem to think that this isn't quite up to par with Moon Safari, 10,000 Hz or Premiers Symptomes. Air is the best discovery for me in years (I just about only listen to classical/opera), and Talkie Walkie is the only album of theirs that has kept me coming back for more and more.    I have listened to Premiers Symptomes, 10,000 Hz, and Moon Safari dozens of times each, but no other album can I listen to all the way through without the slightest desire to advance a single track.  Every song gives me such pleasure in its own little way.  I had to be very careful when I was first getting into the album because I was afraid I was going to burn myself out on it, which has happened before.  But no matter how much I listen, I will never get tired of it, and neither will you!
B00004TA41|5.0|If you are interested in late Coltrane, this is the place to start. Essentially, the album consists of Coltrane going nuts on his saxophone for an hour accompanied by Rashid Ali on drums. <br />Trane takes simple motives and builds them up to brilliant heights. The album is endlessly listenable, because there are many layers of structure to the improvisations. <br />Sometimes Trane seems to wander without a tonal centre; other times he clearly uses a tonal centre, sometimes playing things that recall his earlier playing with the \\"Classic Quartet\\".   <br />Ali's drumming is fine. It sort of melts into the background, which is just the way it should be. He moves smoothly with Trane's changes in tempo and dynamics. He takes a few relatively short solos. <br />This album is essential listening for people interested in late Coltrane, free jazz, and modern music in general.
0312995423|1.0|I am a telecom engineer, but I will not comment on all the technical incongruencies and nonsense already commented by other reviewers. Neither will I comment on the superficial characters and simplistic developments of the plot, that look created for a bad action movie.  <br />As a Spaniard, let me just add one more view on the damn poor research the author did for this book. Part of the story takes place in Seville, but I have my serious doubts that Dan Brown has ever actually been to Spain, or that he is even aware that Spain is located in Europe and not in the american continent. The image the book projects of Spain is not only inaccurate but also sometimes offensive for a spaniard. <br />- The protrait of the Guardia Civil as a corrupt police organization is far from the reputation this police organization has, not only in Spain but also in the rest of Europe.  <br />- A Guardia Civil taking a tourist (the canadian)on his motorbike is far from anything a policemen would do in Spain. Not sure from where the author took this idea, but definitively not from Spain.  <br /> <br />- There are many more details, like the bus service in Seville with no aircon (???), or inefficient public health service... or many of the Spanish expressions, Dan Brown probably copied from a cheap Spanish conversation guide. Just as a minor sample, the author says that Cramberry juice is a very popular drink in Spain (zumo de arandanos, he translates). Just ask any spaniard you know if he/she ever heard about this drink... not me. I just wonder if the caribean and a Spain lonely planet guide is the closer Dan Brown has been to Spain. <br /> <br />If the research he did for Da Vinci Code is as accurate as the one he did for Digital Fortress, his bestseller must be really full of lies, disguised as real facts after thourough \\"rearch\\"... After reading this book, for me Dan Brown has the credibility of a cheap gossip magazine.
B000002VCQ|5.0|Whitney Houston's debut album is now a legendary album and it is being mimicked by every female artist out there today! Had it not been for this album we would not have Mariah, Beyonce'(or Destiny's Child perhaps), Jessica Simpson, Britney, Christina, I mean the list can go on and on. Even though Mariah has made her own mark on the music world, she has even said herself that Whitney Houston inspired her musical stylings. But this album isn't your typical 80's R&B/ Pop album it was different for the time and it really was a success and made a mark in music history. We also have to give it up to Clive Davis because let's face it wihtout him Whitney would not be where she is today. But we love Whitney then and now even though she seems like a totally different person now than back then. WE LOVE U WHITNEY!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|My husband, who grew up in an affluent subarb in California, and I, who grew up in a tiny little coal town in Pennsylvania, viewed this movie very differently. For me, there was a great deal of resonance to the sort of kids I grew up with (and perhaps to some extent the certain type of kid I was) in high school in the 70s. To him, the characters seemed too dumb and unlikeable.<br /><br />I could only guess that those who grow up in urban or suburban settings see less of the sort of inarticulate, unsophisticated kid that Napoleon is and find the character lacking credibility and cannot empathize with him to any extent. Of course, this is a character in a movie that can be categorized as a \\"quirky comedy\\" so he's about 30% more dorky and inarticulate than the worst of what I grew up with but he's close enough to the real thing not to be a parody or caricature.<br /><br />The movie doesn't really have much of a plot but seems more to track a segment of Napoleon's life. Napoleon is awkward, unattractive, and expresses himself in socially inapproriate ways. He's like a 10 year-old stuck in a 16-year old's body. He copes with his lack of ability to relate to others by attempting to form friendships based on very little communication and by drawing fantasy characters of his own invention. The viewer gets the feeling Napoleon isn't quite self-aware enough to be too bothered by anything but is old enough to have certain impulses (like the desire for a girlfriend) that he acts on.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this movie is that, despite his awkwardness, you don't feel sorry for Napoleon because he doesn't feel sorry for himself. He also doesn't seem to get very angry at the injustice of being placed low in the social pecking order or being randomly hit and harrassed by his schoolmates. For the most part, he simply does his thing. It's not that he's oblivious to what is happening, he's just coping in the only way he can and most of those efforts are what are funny about the movie.<br /><br />This isn't a movie with obvious or broad humor. It's the antithesis of humor based on wit or clever dialog while not being stupid humor. It's humor much in the same way that \\"Lost in Translation\\" was a romance. It defies categorization and may or may not be everyone's cup of tea.nny about the movie. <br /> <br />This isn't a movie with obvious or broad humor.

B00030590I|4.0|I thought it was weird seeing the two men looking like they were flying on top of water. The action is inceredible. Jet Li plays an amazing part. This film was shot in China. Maggie Cheung never had any martial arts experence an she fought terrfic. Her and Jet Li were dodging and blocking all those arrows both of them can't be human. What was odd was seeing the characters die and come back to life then die again. I gave it four stars cause it should of been rated \\"R\\" cause in the being Jet Li naked ass was showing and I wanted to see more blood in this movie.
0425173755|5.0|It has been a long time since I have read an Agatha Christie novel.  It was a pleasure to reacquaint myself with Hercule Poirot, her unassuming, unlikely detective.  When Poirot is called back from the middle east to London, he finds himself aboard the Orient Express with a wide cast of characters, unlikely at such a dead travel time of year.  When a passenger is found murdered on the third day of the journey, Poirot sets himself to the task of figuring out who is responsible.<br /><br />With the train stopped by an unexpected snowstorm, Poirot is convinced that the murder, or murderers, is still on board.  He begins by fortuitously uncovering the true identity of the murder victim, then proceeds to interview the passengers as to their actions the night before.  With no way to check their stories, he and his fellow companions must use their reasoning to figure out the mystery at hand.  Yet with each interview that precedes, more and more information is brought to light that confounds, rather than enlightens, the detective process.  With several well-placed red herrings and a few 'blink-and-you'll-miss-it' clues, Poirot is able to dispell the mystery surrounding the murder and present the solution, or solutions, to everyone on board.<br /><br />\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is a well-written and fast-paced novel.  Agatha Christie knew how to throw in twists that at once confound the facts at hand but never distract from the story.  Hercule Poirot, easily unlikeable (in the hands of a lesser writer) for his know-it-all pomposity, is perhaps Christie's best known and best liked detective with good reason.  The case she has conceived for him in this novel is a mystery lover's dream.
079284131X|5.0|Yes, this is the one that started it all, way back in 1988, and has survived through the years to give us SEED OF CHUCKY this year.  Tom Holland, who gave us the delightfully campy FRIGHT NIGHT, also helmed this first in the Chucky series.  Considering this is pre CGI, the effects are very good, and the story creepy in itself.  Chucky of course is the embodiment of a serial killer, played with delightful relish by Brad Dourif.  Killed by detective Chris Sarandon (who was also in FRIGHT NIGHT), the madman uses a voodoo chant to send his spirit into a Good Guy doll in the toy store in which he is killed.  Single mom Catherine Hicks (quite good in her role) buys the doll for her son's birthday.  Best friend and babysitter Dinah Manoff (Soap) is the first victim to feel the wrath of the vengeful Chucky.  Holland keeps things moving quickly and the movie has some fairly suspenseful moments; the Chucky doll is a real killer!  Obviously, the sequels couldn't keep up the innovative thrills of this first movie, but CHILD'S PLAY is a vintage horror thriller.
B0006L16N8|5.0|There are so many extreme reviews on the net regarding this CD. I am not a rock music lover but I love this CD. It grows on you with every listen. Enjoy!
B0009KA7BS|4.0|You have got to be kidding me with the earlier reviews. this movie was very good. It's not Oscar winning but entertaining to say the least. This movie provides interesting storyline and great special effects. I don't really think it was set out to be some \\"exorcist\\" type horror film. Whatever you do watch it. It's more than worth it.

0393035158|2.0|The idea that we all need to question religious beliefs is long overdue and a good one. And it is true that it has been sort of taboo to do this, although there are other titles that explore the same subject. But the author questions religions from a high tower, as if his way of seeing the world is the correct one. His political views are hard to swallow too. For instance, to say that we, as americans, have more \\"moral wealth\\", and that when we bomb, \\"we are killing them for their own good\\", are things that I disagree, and, quite frankly, turned me off for this book. Lots of cheap shots, out-of-context attacks on Arundati Roy and Noam Chomsky - there is absolutely nothing wrong in disagreeing with their ideas, but attack the ideas, not the person, and attack them with better ideas.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Contrary to Amazon's review, there IS a full-length, scene-specific commentary track. Strangely, it is listed nowhere on the packaging. The only way I found out about it was by clicking Audio Options on disc 1, and there you will see the available commentary by Michael Mann, which is dry but informative. Very strange not to promote it - what, are these now going to be like \\"easter eggs\\"?? I admit I was pleasantly surprised to find it. The cinematography is sublime, with terrific blues and greens. I've usually disliked any attempt to shoot features on video, but it is employed to perfection here capturing the cab interior and nighttime cityscape of LA beautifully. It is the best example of the format I've ever seen, so it makes me hopeful that future productions (and technology) will get ever closer to the quality of film stock. It is great to see Cruise play evil, maybe his best performace since TJ Mackey in Magnolia. Foxx of course is a total pro. Jada looks utterly gorgeous. I had some problems with the story as it strains plausibility in MANY scenes, but it's a trade-off made acceptable by superb production values.
B00003CXTG|4.0|People forget that this is a MOVIE, not a documentary, I've never seen so many nitpicking reviews. Who honestly cares if a real fighter plane can't fly 25 feet off the ground? Or if Roosevelt couldn't stand up on his own? <br /> <br />The action sequences in this movie are worth every penny. I have yet to see a better looking movie, the effects were crazy and the action was intense. I didn't buy this DVD to learn about Pearl Harbor, if you want to learn then go buy a documentary or read a book, but if you want a good action packed, intense movie, twisted around a pretty good love story then watch this.
B000002572|5.0|boston's debut album is amongst the greatest along with the debut albums from led zeppelin and black sabbath.this fantastic album sold more than 18 million copies worldwide and contained masterpieces like MORE THAN A FEELING,ROCK AND ROLL BAND,HITCH A RIDE.hugely and strongly recommended.get this with their superb sophomore album DONT LOOK BACK.ignore the previous one star reviewer and avoid all albums from awful nu metal bands and hip hop artists.thank you.
B000002ULO|4.0|Ok, this one isn't as phenomenal as that classic, but it's pretty darn close:  great melodies, superior songwriting, pristine production, to me this harks back to the early days, when the boys would cut loose and the melodies flowed -- think the first solo album, Wildlife, and yes, the hallowed Ram.....<br /><br />Who thought the Macca had it in him, after fine but inconsistent sets throughout the late 80's and early 90's?  But for my money this is an overall better album than any released from Press to Play forward.  The boy still has it, when he wants it....
B000002WAD|3.0|There are a lot of reasons why I consider the way Rick Astley burst on the music scene in 1988 with his debut album \\"Whenever You Need Somebody\\".    The 1980s music landscape had undergone a major change.   The early 1980s pop music sound started out as a Synth-Pop sound, but by the late 1980s transformed to a more \\"natural\\" guitar-laden sound.   It was during this time that even Heavy Metal music was becoming mainstream.    As the 1980s started, the Disco craze had already subsided and the backlash on Disco had begun.  In reality, Disco really morphed into Dance Club music and there always was a niche for Dance Club music in the 1980s.  However, by 1988 even Dance Music was beginning to take a secondary role on the pop-music scene to the more \\"natural guitar-laden\\" sound.   But along comes a British Baritone named Rick Astley - who would take the music world by storm with a string of chart topping hits.   The thing is - his chart toppers were defying a lot of what was happening on the music scene.  For the most part, it was a Synth-Pop sound - and on the charts it was the closest thing that had been seen to classic 1970s Disco.   Overall, Astley would give the British Invasion one last push in the U.S.  Being that Astley's sound and style was a bit like a fish out of water back in 1988, it's no surprise that his burst on the music scene would be short-lived.  While Astley's sound can be considered to be manufactured and to a large extent this is true - there are some clear signs on \\"Whenever You Need Somebody\\" that Astley is able to reach beyond the manufactured walls that were created for him. <br /> <br />For the most part, there is a clear dividing line on the songs on this album.   Four of the songs are songs that Rick Astley wrote or co-wrote.  There are five songs written by the combination of Stock, Aitken and Waterman.   There also is a cover of Edward Hayman and Victor Young's \\"When I Fall in Love\\".    It was the songs written by Stock, Aitken, and Waterman that made up the Rick Astley sound that took the music world by storm.  In other words - much of this was the sound that seemed to give Disco one last push.  For the most part, this is embedded in the hits \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\", \\"Together Forever\\", and \\"It's Gonna Take a Strong, Strong Man\\".  This was also found in the songs \\"Whenever You Need Somebody\\" and \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\".  While these are all catchy songs, the only thing I found of substance to these songs was Astley's terrific baritones.   For the most part - the music in these songs was what I consider \\"manufactured\\".  The music in these songs was heavily synthesizer-laden - and it consisted of a drum machine.   If you extracted Astley's voice off of these songs - you wouldn't hear much more than what I would term \\"filler music\\".    While \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" and \\"Together Forever\\" were the two #1 hits in the U.S. - I felt that \\"It's Gonna Take a Strong, Strong Man\\" and \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" were the two songs that took much better advantage of Astley's vocals. <br /> <br />What clearly surprised me on this album was \\"the other side of the fence\\" - the songs that were written by Astley.   While these songs were not as catchy as the  Stock, Aitken & Waterman numbers, the Astley songs were better songs from a musical perspective.    These songs don't abandon the synthesizer-laden sound at all - but I think they are clearly better in both the music and the lyrics.  The first of the Astley penned songs is \\"The Love Has Gone\\".   This song has a clear Rhythm and Blues sound to it.   I can't say Astley was able to pull off the R&B vocals perfectly - but he does have his moments in the song.   He does a very good job at penning an R&B sound - so he deserves credit for that.   Astley does a far superior job with the both the R&B sound and vocals on \\"Slipping Away\\".  This is a song that was penned by Astley alone.   While again Astley relies on a Synthesizer-laden sound, he does bring in some horns and this supplements the song beautifully.   There is a terrific trumpet solo midway through the song.  There are also some nice background vocals on this song.   On \\"You Move Me\\", Astley again reaches for the Rhythm and Blues sound.  This song almost has a Luther Vandross feel to it.  Once again, I can't say that Astley pulls the R&B vocals off perfectly, but somehow he finds a way to make it work.   This also seems to be the best song from a lyrical standpoint on the collection.   There are some nice background vocals that provide the perfect compliment to Astley.   On \\"No More Looking for Love\\", this is probably the one Astley penned song that sounds like the Stock, Aitken, and Waterman sound.   This was probably the weakest of the Astley penned tracks, but again Astley uses his baritones to make this song work.   <br /> <br />It's the last song that really made me realize that Astley is well-rounded musician.  On Hayman and Young's \\"When I Fall in Love\\", we see a new side to the Astley baritones - crooning!   Astley sounds completely different, but to me it was no surprise Astley was able to pull this off.  His vocals are what dominated many of the songs on this album - and this is a necessary ingredient as a crooner. <br /> <br />After this album,  Astley would begin to take his career in different directions and look at things a bit more artistically.   Whether you like what he did after this album or not, this album shows the signs that Astley could do this.  It might not be the strongest album, but still is worth checking out.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Wow....this band plays the safest, most boring music I've ever heard.  4 chords over and over don't make a song.  I find it disgraceful that people feel this album is \\"amazing.\\"  As a piano player myself, this album has absolutely no musicianship to it at all.  It's processed mainstream pop, and it sucks.

Too bad we didn't know back then what masterpieces got churned out in the 80's in comparison to the dreck we get foisted on us these days...the younger generation don't know what they are missing!  Do your self a favor, Napoleon Dynamite fans, go watch Better off Dead and see why that is a superior movie
B00005JNJT|5.0|I endorse this film whoelheartedly, in a way that I endorse few others.   <br /> <br />This film succeeds in a way that ALL of the Batman films failed, where most HOLLYWOOD films fail for that matter.  Instead of \\"big stars,\\" it has great actors, chief among them being Christian Bale as  Batman.    <br /> <br />Whereas Tim Burton's films seemed obsessed with the way the films looked, Nolan cares more about plot, script, performances, and other concepts long since abandoned  by Hollywood.   <br /> <br />Comparisons to Joel Schumacher's Batman films aren't necessary, as they were horrible.   <br /> <br />Go see this film.  It's easily the best film of the year. Period.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|I listen to this everyday. Quality writing. Quality melodies. The critics say it's too full of love and emotion. DUH!!! Isn't that what real music is about? I find this criticism funny since Coldplay has sold over 20 million albums. Go buy X & Y. Ignore the critics who are truly musician wannabes.
B000294SFW|5.0|Well, one day I was looking for some heavy rock, and I found INFERNO, I thought that it was a good a idea to buy the latest M&ouml;torhead album just to hear what they were doing, and surprise!!!<br /><br />When I heard INFERNO my idea about M&ouml;torhead changed 180°, because the intensity and heaviness of the album are something that I don't listen in a long time. I need to accept that I have only Ace of Spades and Orgasmatron albums just for the title songs.<br /><br />Since then in couple of weeks I bought Bastards (great album too, listen to \\"burner\\"), Overkill, the BoxSet and a couple of DVD's, 25th anniversary & boneshaker concert and \\"Ace of spades\\" classic album.<br /><br />I'd been a Heavy Metal fan since Master of Puppets and Reign in blood were released, and right now I understand why Motorhead is an influence for bands in 30 years, and something that I really like a lot is that they still continue rocking the same since the beginning, even better.<br /><br />Heavy Metal come and go through decades, and bands like Metallica, Anthrax and others are dead. Only M&ouml;torhead stills rock and I hope the continue 30 years more.<br /><br />Buy it and listen to it, you will never regret. I promise
B0000029AL|5.0|A band so amazing as Aerosmith will live on through the years to come and will always have an impact on their listeners. A work old as this never ceases to give the same awesome feeling as it did back in 1973. Aerosmith made their way to me throughout my early childhood years and has remained one of my favorite classic rock bands. Their songs and lyrics also are a personal influence on me as their words are provocative and is germane to so many things that I see and face in life. \\"Dream On\\" is one of the best examples as I can relate to it from a religious point of view from my faith. Their views on life and religion is so strikingly amazing that their works never become old; nevertheless, living through the past few decades have imbued on them what many of us young people have not seen or experienced in life. As their works continue to inspire me musically and mentally, Aerosmith will remain strong in the future as it did over three decades ago.

0316172324|3.0|Humans make snap decisions about people and things.  That's a great concept to understand.  But is that one concept worth an entire book?<br /><br />The problem with Blink is that once you agree with the author's initial concept, he never makes a value judgment about whether this phenomenon is a good thing or a band thing.  In fact, he makes both arguments ...<br /><br />The first half of the book makes the argument that our \\"gut\\" instinct is usually correct - in fact - it's more accurate than using logic and reasoning.<br /><br />The second half debunks that theory by implying our biases skew the accuracy of our blink response.<br /><br />Both arguments are buttressed by interesting stories.  Either could be true.  But in the end, you don't really know which argument to believe.  Should we trust our gut instinct?  The book never answers that question.<br /><br />Additionally, the book misses the chance to teach readers how to influence a persons \\"blink\\" reaction.  Marketers and salesmen who are reading this book to find out how to influence consumers had better look elsewhere.<br /><br />In short, this is a great title and an interesting book, but it's like a movie that starts off with a great concept, but leaves you disappointed when the lights come back on.
B000001EAQ|4.0|Review no. 338. I don't care about what others might say about this here U2's 'Pop' release. I still like it better than their previous effort 'Zooropa'. I've been a U2 fan since the very beginning, their Popmart tour was obviously the most massive of it's kind. I should know, I saw it from up front of the stage. My two favorite cuts off this CD are &#34;Mofo&#34; and the ass-kicking &#34;Gone&#34;. Other stand outs include &#34;Last Night On Earth&#34; (they shot the video for this tune the day after the concert that I saw and it did cause some problems, several business owners didn't like shutting their stores down for one day to accommodate the video crew - it WAS on the news, several times), &#34;Do You Feel Loved&#34;, &#34;If God Will Send His Angels&#34; and &#34;Miami&#34;. To me at least, a true keeper.

0141439475|5.0|I have seen so many Frankenstein movies. As a result I expected this book to be like them. It wasn't. The monster wanted what everyone wants: to be loved, to be needed, to be appreciated, to be accepted. Frankenstein created the monster and abandoned him. It was the abandonment that started Frankenstein's creation on the road to monsterhood. The cottagers' rejection of him was the final touch that created the monster. After that he lashed out. He tormented Frankenstein as he himself was tormented. Who really was the monster Frankenstein or his creation? Everytime I here the term Frankenstein's monster I have a very different connotation of it than I did before.
B00005AACC|1.0|The first movie was great- you got to use your brain, there was tactic involved- real danger....  <br />not just Tom Cruise doing sommersaults in the air and, \\"ooo look Cruise will now let go of the rock even though he could die because he is so high in the air and he will jump to another rock just so that we can see his muscles\\".... there are car chases that you can tell are fake because they don't even try to hide the fact that the cars in the background are 3 times the size of the cars they are in.... the \\"point of the movie\\" is that Cruise needs to destroy this HORRIBLE disease-causing thing that makes your face BLEED from every pore on your face.... BUT of course, when the beautiful woman he decides that he \\"loves\\" shoots herself with the stuff and Cruise arrives on the scene a few moments before she dies- she's just a bit dizzy.... why bother showing what happens to a person when infected with that crap if it doesn't happen to the girl when SHE gets infected with it?   <br />I wasn't impressed.... thumbs down- this movie was a waste of time.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Being hyped a whole bunch, my expectations for In Your Honour were definitely huge.<BR>Foo Fighters definatly have guts for doing something this different, because different usually means something risky that the fans arent used to. However, Foo Fighters make it fit.<BR>At first, Disc 1 is a little hard to swallow. It seems too consistant, but the more I played the it, the more it grew on me and the more I liked it. The title track starts the album off with a bang and it just keeps going. My other favourites off of Disc 1 were No Way Back, DOA (awesome tune), and The Deepest Blues are Black.<BR>The acoustic CD got me right off the bat. The first song Still starts off Disc 2 with a really cool feeling. My other favourites were Another Round, Cold Day in the Sun (which I have a feeling will be an instant radio favourite, please dont over play it you fools!), and Virginia Moon (bizarrely interesting, its definitely a departure from anything wed expect, but since when do we know what to expect from the Foo?).<BR>By now, I love this album and I recommend it for all Foo fanatics and even the casual fans. The Foo will pick up some more fans along the way because a lot of non-fans will love the acoustic disc.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Some people, even lovers of De-Loused in the Comatorium, have renounced the Volta's latest installment because of what they deem to be excessive filler noise and not enough actual songs.  To this, I say you must follow the subnames given to each track and understand that all the crazy atmospheric sound is intended to set a mood and serves its purpose effectively.  It's not like there's more sound effects than music on the whole album and, even if there's just as much, the way they weave the different parts throughout the entire CD is incredible. <br /> <br />Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus (5/5)- Sarcophagi, the introduction that competes with De-Loused's first track, leads into one of my favorite songs of theirs to date, Umbilical Syllables.  Immediately, one can hear the raw energy is still prevalent if not even moreso.  The third, slower part of the song contains one of the coolest beats I've ever heard with Omar soloing on top of it, disjointedly as ever. The song then loops back to the chorus, then transitions into Con Safo before descending into one of the ambient noise parts referred to earlier. <br />The Widow (4/5)- The shortest track on the disc, it's a nice semi-mellow tune that has lyrics as creepy as the video that accompanies it.  However, what the video doesn't have is the trippy transition that leads into the next song. <br />L'Via L'Viaquez (5/5)- Another one of my favorites, it's really catchy even though the part that gets stuck in your head the most is in Spanish and has a kickass beat that's worthy of a hot Latino night club.  The other catchy part is in English and has cool lyrics plus another killer guitar solo following it.  The parts repeat but the segues and solos are different every time.  Especially the alternating piano/guitar solo at the end that goes on for about two and a half minutes.  Maybe some people just aren't used to how jammed out Mars Volta's getting. <br />Miranda that Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore (4/5)- This song starts out with four minutes of spooky ghost howling before the trumpet intro provided by none other than Flea.  Then, Pour Another Icepick starts in minute five, it definitely being the ballad of the album.  Excellent lyrics in the chorus and an overall haunting feel that I can't get enough of.  The third part of the song, Pisacis (I have no idea what these words mean), is yet another co-solo this, time featuring trumpet and guitar followed by more tripped-out sounds.  Then Con Safo fades in for its first return before being abruptly ended by the beginning of the last and longest song on the CD. <br />Cassandra Gemini (5/5)- I'll go ahead and review each part of the song separately since they each have their own track: <br />Tarantism- Rockin' intro leads to a cool little part where Cedrick talks with his voice on a creepy effect and there's actually some flute playing under it.  This song has awesome lyrics and a catchy chorus all put together in such an originally outstanding way.  What seems to be the bridge of the song actually segues into the next track. <br />Plant a Nail in the Navel Stream- Omar rips it up on this solo before Cedrick sings one of the creepiest yet most brilliant parts he's ever written.  I love how he brings up widows, L'via, Cygnus and icepicks all over again, showing how all the songs are tied together to make one story. <br />Faminepulse- The buildup part where the same mad phrases are shouted over and over.  I don't know how they do it, but they make it work. <br />Multiple Spuse Wounds- The final nutty jamout of Frances with Cedrick's rantings shrinking to a whisper and ending with sucking sounds.  Things chill out only for a while though as the band opens up again before coming back down so Cedrick can peel back all of his skin.  I think his painful shouting during that part is supposed to be symbolic of that. <br />?- This instrumental part starts out with another soft tangent full of guitar effects and the same repeating bass riff for five minutes.<br />Plant a Nail in the Navel Stream (Reprise)- As if they didn't have enough instruments on this album, this starts out with a wild saxophone solo that leads into the main Navel Stream riff. <br />Tarantism (Reprise)- And at the perfect time they bring back the chorus for this, the shortest of all the parts. <br />Sarcophagi- This magnificent CD ends with the same thing it started with.  These guys never cease to amaze me. <br /> <br />It's exteremely hard to create groundbreaking rock such as this and I thought it would have been impossible for this band to come close to the creativity De-Loused had.  I guess I was wrong.  The way in which they interweave the different sections is nothing short of sheer genius. I won't say if I like this better or worse than De-Loused because it's so different but I will say that Mars Volta is one of the most abstractly talented bands ever and this instant classic is a prime example of their astonishing musicianship.  <br />

B0002GTX4Q|5.0|I had just gotten into foreign films when i first saw this movie in a small theatre in The U-District, and at the 2 or 3 main (Intense) scenes, at least 2 people walked out at each one.  Never has a movie affected me like that. I watched in awe at what was happening and although some scenes were brutal, The movie captured something that is often unseen and untalked about in civilized conversation. The question it answers is \\"What Would you do if someone you love was brutally assualted?\\".  The movie starts out nauseating with its spinning picture for the first five minutes, but i applaude there realistic adaptions of events that took place and playing a movie backwards is a new twist that seemed to work on this film, keeping you wondering what is going on throughout the movie.  Its not for everyone, but a must see if you like creativity and originality.  My Collector's edition came with a strip of negative film which was cool.
0805076476|5.0|Done in a comically unique fashion, it holds a powerful message, that is quite interesting, and frankly makes for a great read.  The writing, although sparce, and sometimes awkwardly worded.  The story maintains to be a great story, with a scope, that is both wide and narrow.<br /><br />  The story is comical when you don't expect it to be comical, and so from that, I'd have to conclude, buying this novel, as it says.  Literary Edition.  So many great ways to write literature, and people keep discovering new ways

B00006ADGP|1.0|Sadly, this is a perfectly awful copy, possibly from a VHS tape. The voices are also dubbed rather than subtitled. It is actually All Region rather than Region 1, as the Amazon description says. Scola deserves better than he has gotten for his many fine films. Why doesn't Criterion do a Scola collection?
B0006399FS|4.0|Ok, I'm a huge U2 fan. As a U2 fan, just as others have stated, this album is a dud for U2. I love U2, and I love almost everything they have ever put out, even the Passengers CD. But to echo other reviewers, this CD is U2 echoing themselves. You can listen to a lot of the songs here and hear veins of past U2 songs of greatness. Some examples would be the similarity of Vertigo to Elevation, Sometimes You Can't Make It... to One, and City of Blinding Lights to Where the Streets Have No Name. Thorough U2 fans see this similarity, which is why they like I give this album a 3.<br /><br />However, this album is better than All That You Can't Leave Behind. ATYCLB was a calculated safe album by U2 after what they thought was a failure in Pop. This album can be argued as a safe album, but I do think they were being experimental. Only they were evolving from ATYCLB, which still leaves them short of their glorious 90's. The other thing that I see the Bomb as doing is trying to reach back to the Boy, October, and War era sound. Unfortunately, this album is way too calculated and over-produced for that to really work.<br /><br />Now, I give this album a 3 as a U2 fan because it is better than ATYCLB, and Love and Peace or Else, Miracle Drug, and if you bought the extended version: Fast Cars, show that U2 does have it in them to create great music lyrically and uniquely. It is too bad they decided to cut Fast Cars from the general wide-spread release because that is where the title of the album comes from, and it has an awesome sound. It is too bad they didn't keep that sound throughout the album.<br /><br />That all being said, the general fan in me recognizes this album as great for the non-U2 fan. While it could be lyrically stronger for a U2 album, it is as strong as modern pop music seems to get. The radio hits are there, and I give U2 credit for making meaningful music hip for what the fans want. In that regard I give the album a 5, and I suggest this album to anyone who wants to listen to great music but could care less who it came from.<br /><br />It is just unfortunate, that U2 feel the need to cater to the popular music fans. I miss the creativity that U2 used to have. Sure, there is some creativity here, but over half these songs were throw aways from past U2 efforts. It is no wonder that U2 singles lack the great B-Sides we used to be accustom too. Oh well... at least these songs are replacing some of the real crap that gets over-played on the radio. Perhaps U2 will gain some momentum and make a bigger evolution on the next go round.ne who wants to listen to great music but could care less who it came from.  <br /> <br />It is just unfortunate, that U2 feel the need to cater to the popular music fans.

B0007GAERG|5.0|This is an amazing comeback for Mimi.  The CD has great  songs, and has amazing colaborations with people like Snoop Dogg and Jeramine Dupri.  It's a wonderful CD, made for any mood you might be in.  Whether your in or out of love, this is the CD for everyone.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|You know something isn't right when the first scene of the movie is Christian Bale's Trevor Reznik (a name that constantly has me thinking of NIN) is rolling up someone in a rug before taking the rug to the ocean and dumps it.  Trevor, looking feverish, beat up, and deathly thin gives a striking image and makes us wonder, what is going on?      Normally, it annoys me when people credit actors with gaining weight (Bridget Jones' Diary), using prosthetics (Nicole Kidman) or losing weight (Christian Bale in this movie).  It annoys me not that the actors are doing it but that the simple act of doing it should give them credance that they are Great Actors.  I think diminishing their acting skills to a prosthetic or weight loss/gain as the reason for applause is as phony as the prosthetic.  So of course here we knew that Christian Bale lost 63 pounds to play the gaunt character.  And while it adds a lot to his role, and is quite a thing to do, it's his acting as the lost Trevor that makes this movie the excellent noir it is.    Director Brad Anderson imbues his dark movie with shades of grays and blues.  The majority of the movie is filmed in an almost black and white color scheme.  Everything is washed out, just like Trevor's life.  Trevor has been suffering from insomnia and hasn't slept in a year.  He keeps track of his weight loss as well.  The only comforts in his life are two women, one a prostitute and the other a waitress at an airport cafe.  These two women basically provide the only company Trevor gets in his life.  To compound this situation even more, a man named Ivan shows up, bringing with him a lot of trouble.  Which leads to the question of why?  Why is all of this happening?  This question is central to the whole movie.    In fact, what makes this movie work really well is that it's a puzzle.  It gives the viewers a situation and a problem, and then takes us on a crazy ride through one man's life.  Little pieces of the puzzle become clear to those payingattention, and by the end of the movie every little thing you've seen or thought you saw makes sense.  Mostly, it's a very clever movie.  There are a few puzzle pieces that are too blatantly obvious.  In fact, I will bet that a good majority of the people watching this movie will catch the first \\"twist.\\"  Right from the beginning it is hinted at, and not all that subtly.  But by the end where the central question to the movie is answered, I was taken by surprise.  By that time I was so invested into the story that it just surprised me but made so much sense.      And that is the highest praise I can give this movie: it makes sense.  It's mysterious and involves \\"twists\\" but the twists make perfect sense.  By the end of the movie, you can see why the entire film took place.  It's realistic in that aspect.  I very highly recommend this movie.  It's interesting and can be suspenseful.  It moves slowly, but it's a slow build that continually rachets up the tension and suspense.  Very well done.  Worth owning.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars, in my opinion the greatest movie saga ever, on DVD is a must buy. The changed scenes and lines are true, but do they really change the story? I believe these altered parts make the movie somewhat better, when watching it from the TWO trilogies perspective. Seeing Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) at the end of Return Of The Jedi, makes it more noticeable and important, when you have episode 2 and 3 just out. Changed lines and (if you havent noticed) new the sith lord/emperor are done to make episode 1, 2, and 3 more connected, and similar to the original trilogy.   Now I love the original Star Wars, and would own those tapes if i could, but technology has changed through these 27-28 years. Of course you have the Dolby 5.1 surround sound, and the color it so much better. Just look at C3PO. The sound has been MODIFIED, not changed, just to sound better through your speakers.  And possibly the main reason to buy this set (main would be if you dont own Star Wars already), is the bonus feature disc, which has a 2 and a half hour documentary through the ups and downs of George Lucas and the making of the original Star Wars trilogy. There is also some sub-documentaries about the lightsaber, characters, and how Star Wars changed the movie industry. A true collector feature is the tv spots, commercials, and teasers of each Star Wars movie, which is fun to see, because its before Star Wars changed the world. And if you're a video game fan, you get a tight demo of Star Wars battlefront for xbox, and the \\"making-of\\" of Star Wars episode 3 game.    Now i dont expect a lot of ppl agreeing with me, but think of the newer generation of fans, and the ones to come. This dvd set is better than just hearing about it. If Lucas left it alone, he would of definately got crap from Fox and the \\"original\\" star wars fans, for wanting to milk the original Star Wars for every cent its worth.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I think we're in for good things with the new Batman movies.  Batman Begins is epic in scope and feel.  At 2 hours and 20 minutes, a lot happens in the film.  Not only does it setup how Bruce Wayne became the Batman but it also introduces a slew of baddies and sets an epic struggle for Gotham City.  I remember as the movie ramped up to an excellent climax, sitting there and seeing everything that was happening and I wondered, THIS is the BEGINNING?  It was so well executed that it felt like the end of an epic series, rather than the beginning.   <br /> <br />And what a beginning it is.  Taking different aspects from the comic books, Director Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer create a very realistic universe while at the same time making it thematically Batman.   <br /> <br />The big bone of contention is probably the Batmobile which looks nothing like the comics nor any of the movies.  I happen to like it, it's a different take on it and fits into their realistic mode more than the sleek and slender car does.  The other slight problem is that Christian Bale's \\"Batman voice\\" gets pretty corny towards the end.  His growling at enemies, while masking his voice true, really takes away from the drama and tension of the scenes.   <br /> <br />The villains are great as well.  Cillian Murphy (from 28 Days Later) is my favorite as the Scarecrow.  Talk about gritty and pretty frightening.  Tom Wilkinson as a mobster also was really well done.   <br /> <br />I don't know what to say about this movie that doesn't spoil the joy found within.  All I can say is that this is the best version of Batman released yet.  It even towers above the Tim Burton Batmans that I loved back in the 90s.  It's a great new start, and Christopher Nolan isn't shying away.  Look for the gutsy calling card at the end of the film.  A very gutsy move indeed for the next villain.  Great film, great time, I doubly recommend it.  The summer movie season has finally begun.

B0000WN0ZK|2.0|Maybe that's the whole point. Blow Up is about empty people living empty lives. That's fine, as long as the film they are in entertains me. But Blow Up is a bore. Nothing happens. You wait patiently. The film moves at snail's pace. Blow Up represents the most aimless tendencies of foreign film. It has a French-like tendency (desire?) to meander. Blow Up has at best thirty minutes of content stretched to nearly two hours.<br />  Characters act cold and distant and more than a bit cruel. The movie ends with mimes (never a good sign) pretending to play tennis in the park. Fin. Credits roll. What does it all mean? And why should I care? Films do not have to have a point. A character up to his neck in ennui who is on an existential quest to nowhere (as in Eyes Wide Shut) is okay. But if your film has nothing to say, make it interesting--either visually or in its dialogue. But Blow Up takes a mimimalistic approach. Long silences. Little action. No emotion. It is about an hour into the movie that something finally \\"happens\\"--a seeming murder. I thought the film might take a Hitchcockian turn. But it doesn't. Was the man in the park murdered? Did the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) have him killed? Why was the body left there? Was he cheating with her, or was she cheating with him? We never get the answer to such questions, because no one in the movie cares enough to find out. Is this a statement about the vacuousness of 60s culture? I guess. A postmodern statement about man's indifference to man? Maybe. But I didn't care enough about the characters to care about the movie's message (if there is one). Blow Up represents a view so world weary that naked romping (scandalous then, tame by today's standards) by supermodels and a cameo by the Yardbirds (yes, that's Jimmy Page) can't lighten the mood. Is Blow Up an embrace of \\"cool\\" or a rejection of it? Who knows? I can only be sure that this movie was deserved grist for the Austin Powers parody mill. Mike Myers movies are fun. Blow Up is not.is not.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is an amazing CD. It is without a doubt my favorite Green Day CD. The best song on the whole CD I think is Misery.

Its just amazing, one of those CDs you can listen to start to finish and not have to click to the next song.
0141301139|5.0|This book is great for kids under the age of 11, or for that matter, anybody that has an imagination! The story does not have any plotline, (as with many other Roald Dahl books) instead just a simple story about a family of foxes. How they are able to trick the three mean farmers that shot off Mr. Fox's beautiful tail. The story starts with Mr. Fox asking his children what they would like for dinner; a chicken? A goose? Or a Turkey. After the children have made their choice, Mr. Fox would sneak out quietly into the night and retrieve the poultry. Everything seemed to be perfect for this fox family, until the three farmers in charge of the chicken, goose, and turkeys, did not like this arrangement. They settled a stakeout in Mr. Fox's hole waiting for the perfect time. To find out what happened next, you're going to have to get this book! I loved it the moment I laid eyes on it; since I have quite a huge imagination for my age. The story is exciting, sad, happy, funny, all mixed together into one great book. Roald Dahl is long gone by now, but his books will still delight and entertain those that live after him.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Christopher Nolan, with his new Batman Christian Bale, set out to tear down the franchise as it existed in the previous four \\"Batman\\" films and reconstruct it anew.  They did so with great success by building the movie around the Batman character, and by building the Batman character bit by bit. <br /> <br />Here were the two main problems with the Batman franchise in the other four films: (1) the directors; (2) the Batmans. Pretty deadly combination. And be honest, it's true. Fans of the Batman comics despised the choice of Michael Keaton to play Batman, and I thought he actually did a better job as Batman than as a rather doddering Bruce Wayne. But he was upstaged by the villains (especially JACK) and Keaton's weak chin always detracted from the stalwart defender-of-justice Batman is supposed to be. Tim Burton did a decent job in the semi-plotless Batman, but he mailed it in on the sets and atmosphere in Batman Returns and all that rot about hiding behind masks was just a useless directorial essay inspired by a 17-year old (at that point) Billy Joel song, The Stranger. Who cared? <br /> <br />As for Val Kilmer -- a nondescript Batman and Bruce Wayne hampered by a cruddy director (Joel Schumacher), a poor script, an overemphasis on the man-boobs in the batsuit and a just-picking-up-my-paycheck performance by Tommy Lee Jones. So bad, I didn't even see Batman & Robin, with the over-smug George Clooney and what were reportedly the two worst performances by villains in any action movie not involving Timothy Dalton. <br /> <br />So the bar is not high for Batman Begins to beat any of the prior four. It does, but it does more than that. Indeed, if Batman Begins had been the first of the five Batman movies, its reputation as one of the most mismanaged comic-hero legacies would never have been made. And here's why: <br /> <br />First, the Batman. Christian Bale is a creepy bugger primarily because of his starring turn in American Psycho. But as a brooding, damaged and haunted Bruce Wayne, he conveys the essential roots of the Dark Knight as an avenger who will do justice better than any other on-screen Batman. Indeed, the only one who approximates Bale's heavy soul is Kevin Conroy -- the voice actor who was Batman in Batman: The Animated Series. A milquetoast Kilmer and clueless-playboy Keaton did not come anywhere near to conveying Bruce Wayne's pain or dark side; Bale hits those notes and does it well. <br /> <br />Second, the direction and story. Christopher Nolan essentially destroys the previous Batman movies in order to recreate the legend here. Batman begins as a rich American in a Southeast Asian wilderness who has lost his sense of himself, only vaguely knows his ultimate goal and needs a lifeline from the mysterious Henri Ducard to help him find his way. Nolan shows the decline of Gotham as it parallelled the decline of the Wayne family, the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, the child's stifling guilt and loss of his moorings, his Asian martial arts training (shown also in the animated series) and his initial fight against the corruption of Gotham. Through all this, Nolan is capable of showing the building of the basic foundation of the legend: the Batcave, the Batmobile, the Batsuit, the utility belt, and the answer to Joker's question in the 1989 Batman: \\"where does he get those wonderful toys?\\" <br /> <br />Some critics complain that this is a slower, duller Batman. Not so: there's plenty of action throughout, but this really isn't a classic action movie, it's an action movie and a drama rolled into one.  <br /> <br />Third, the villains: not merely outcasts who are oddly twisted by fluke physical transformations, the Batman Begins villains are power hungry, clever and coldly evil.  <br /> <br />There are weaknesses: Katie Holmes is 26 but seems 21; so she's miscast as a hard-charging anti-corruption assistant DA. The motivations of the Scarecrow (one of the villains) is unexplored (although that may be fodder for anotherfilm) and there are other minor concerns.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, however, Batman Begins is the only Batman movie that is a flat-out good movie. It deserves the sequel it will spawn.

This book might be a bit boring to those with either no or little patience since all of her books tend to start off quite dull. By chapter 3 or 4 the story should get interesting. So all you people out there that haven't read it before, read it. Read it before but stopped cause the beginning was boring, read it again. This book deserves a special place reserved in your bookshelf for years to come.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Admit it. You started out with iPod ratings around three or four stars, now all of a sudden 8 out of 13 tracks have ratings of five stars. X&Y, Swallowed In The Sea, and Twisted Logic are all coming on strong. How about that Beatlesque crescendo at the end of What If and its transition into the tom-tom opening of White Shadows? Absolutely soaring. <br /> <br />Anyone who grew up singing church hymns will love the closing chords of White Shadows and the reverential opening of Fix You. This album is so seamless it must be appreciated as a body of work -- you are missing out if you listen only to the samples because they are completely deceptive. <br /> <br />Forget the references to other bands -- the album is distinctively Coldplay with brilliant integration of influential bands. The bottom line is that I can't stop listening to it -- it is a masterpiece.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Foo Fighters and have been since the beginning,still find it amazing that Grohl was the DRUMMER for Nirvana! Anyway, this album musically may be the bands most diverse offering yet, songs like \\"Best of You\\" and \\"Resolve\\" are classic Foo.Also, tracks \\"No way back\\" and \\"deepest blues are back\\" may be some of their best songwriting yet. It is also  understandable that a bit of a \\"Queens of the Stone Age\\" sound blend into this offering,being that Grohl is the drummer for them , and I also love the format of the package with one disc being Heavy and one being soft. We listened to the soft album during Fathers Day Dinner and My 70 Year Old Father In Law Loved it!! LOL   However it is irritataing that depending on your office IT Cop you may not be able to access the music on your work PC. With the built in Copy protection on the disc, which also makes it a bit of a pain to download the album onto my MP3 Player. I understand the need for Copy Protection, but rest assured this particular stab at it doesn't work and really only hurts the consumer who purchased the material. If we buy it we should be able to put it on our PC's There Must be another way!  That being Said, this Offering will be a steady fixture in my home and car systems for a long, long time!
B0001XAS1M|5.0|Plain and simple, this is the best album of all time! The title song is not beaten by any track on any other album. It has everything. To anyone who does not agree with that statement is a fool with absolutely no taste. Ever song delivers a huge thrill. The album starts \\"PERFECTLY\\" and finishes with a great bang too. Steinman and Meat Loaf know how to make an album!

B00003A9QL|5.0|I have been a fan of Metallica's music since \\"Kill 'Em All\\" so I picked up this album without really noticing what the \\"S\\" in the \\"S&M\\" stood for. I just wanted to get their latest release.  I thought \\"S&M\\" meant what \\"S&M\\" usually means, and it was just a catchy name for a newly released live album. I knew all their older songs already. So when I played it the first time, I was like \\"what the h***!\\"??? Then I looked at the cover and noticed that \\"S\\" stood for symphony. While I \\"appreciate\\" classical music, I don't particularly like listening to it-- I hear my fill of it as background music when my kid is watching cartoons or while shopping at the local grocery store/riding an elevator, etc. Surely my Metallica wasn't contaminated with a bunch of strings and cymbols, yet it was!  But I'm a pragmatist, and I had just spent almost thirty bucks buying it, so I decided to give it a fair chance. And now this is absolutely my favorite album by Metallica.<br /><br />This album combines the opposite elements of metal and symphony like they always belonged together, like in a yen-yang symbol. (I know, corny analogy, but that is exactly what happens.)How can something be \\"beautiful\\" but \\"ROCK\\" at the same time? I don't know, but Metallica pulled this paradox off perfectly, and it blew me away! No compromises either, the rock-rocks, the symphony is perfect and touching, especially in \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\". You'll just have to listen to it yourself, though it might take some getting used to at first. It's worth every penny!
B0002XVQNU|1.0|and people buying this ''directors cut'' have no brains.how does the saying go?!?!?!? a fool and their money.......this was/IS a horrible movie no matter what cut it is.i never gave into a blind super hero.no matter how in tune he is to his overly hyped up other senses,you cant sense a bullet and move fast enough.the bad guys were comic relief and garner,why was she even in this?!?!?!?!?does there always have to be a love interest?!?!?(if the makers want women in the seats i guess so....ggggrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@catering!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)heres a funny,but true story when i went to see this mess....about 30 minutes into it i was awakened by someone elses louder snoring.that sums it up for me.
B00000IPAX|4.0|well lets set the facts straight--blink 182 is not punk. they are pop punk. now nothings wrong with that, im just saying that if you think they are punk, listen to the sex pistols, the ramones, or the clash among many others. this stuff is not hardcore in the least. my mother likes this music. <br /> <br />now tom delonge doesnt suck at guitar; but there was one jacka$$ on here who said tom was better than yngwie malmsteen, joe satriani, and zakk wylde. this is totally false. i learned this whole CD on guitar in less than 2 days. there are catchy hooks, but no noteworthy guitar work. kurt cobain was a genius, but not a great guitar player. avril lavigne? wow she cannot play guitar to save her life. in an interview, she didnt even know who judas priest were. thats like a prerequisite to rock stardom. <br /> <br />marks a good bass player, but he cant even touch cliff burton. cliff is the jimi hendrix of bass. listen to orion by metallica. no comparison. <br /> <br />travis, on the other hand, is an amazing drummer. that guys work is astounding. i cant even fathom it. its nuts. <br /> <br />basically, this album is hard not to like. its catchy. the lyrics are wild and rebellious at times, but slow and heartfelt too. <br /> <br />
B0002858YS|4.0|This is The Killers first album release and whilst it has 2 good songs in 'Mr Brightside' and 'Someone Told Me', the rest of the album is poorly executed. But The Killers show promise of improvement, firstly they need to find a signature sound that will be equated to their name. At the moment the Killers sound like a cross between Oasis and Doves. But then many bands on their first record release don't release CDs all perfect. The two songs as I have stated are perfect, catchy tunes that mix rock with grunge that sounds from the 80's.<br /><br />Not a bad buy for any music listener out to hear new Brittish rock pop artists on debut.
B00000IQV7|1.0|Perhaps there are some good points made in this movie about doctor patient relationships and the overly technical aproach to western medicine that is taught in medical school... However, this is one of the most cynical emotionally explotative movies I've ever seen.  The movie is like some kind of insidious Pavlovian device designed to ellicit, nay wring an emotional response out of the viewing audience.  From the insanely intrusive and overwrought music to the asinine and oftimes preachy dialog, to the completely predictable plot, it's all designed to make you FEEL and is as subtle as getting hit repeatedly in the head with a shoe.  The attempts to tug on my heartstrings are so blatant, so obvious, so phony that I found them to be offensive. For example: the scene where Patch gets an old and depressed woman to eat by dragging her into a wading pool filled with spaghetti is one of the most stupid, childish, embarrassing, not to mention logistically improbable scenes ever committed to film. At least we suppose she eats because all we see her do is idiotically cavort in the pool and dump spaghetti on William's head. Problem solved! The bad guys, who are cartoonish straw men, and the good guys, i.e. Patch, might as well have been wearing black and white hats for all the subtlety of the music and dialog. Of course Patch's establishment bucking and unorthodox ways are vindicated in a final \\"court\\" scene which rings as false as it is formulaic. I am not a monkey and don't appreciate being manipulated as though my IQ was that of a chimp. Patch Adams is Robin Williams at his most icky and moviemaking at it's most disingenuous. The real Patch Adams is much more than just a funny doctor.
B0002KPIQY|2.0|Well, it looks like I definitely have a contrarian opinion here because so many amazonians loved \\"Gia,\\" but I simply could not get into this movie even though I watched the entire thing.  Due to its weak plot and characterization, I don't know if we can really make a statement regarding Jolie's acting talents.  There's not much that she could have done with such a stunted role. It is profoundly difficult to form any type of attachment to Gia.  She's just not someone you can feel empathy for.<br /><br />I will grant that many of the party and sex scenes are magnetic, but, despite their visual interest, they are in no way a legitimate substitute for a meaningful plot.  With the lesbian scenes, I understand why the movie caused a stir, but it seems to me that, if one is interested in such things, there are more direct and uniform sources from which to derive these pleasures. At every level, \\"Gia\\" just doesn't work.
B00000JLWW|3.0|\\"Titanic\\" belongs in that very special, very baffling category: bad movies you like anyway (some others are \\"Dirty Dancing,\\" \\"Field of Dreams,\\" \\"Gone With the Wind\\"...you get the idea). <br /> <br />Trash, trash, trash: Cameron manages to render an historical event completely unbelievable - but absolutely fun.  Visually, the movie (NOT \\"film\\"!) is gorgeous, the actors are gorgeous, the costumes are gorgeous, the sets are gorgeous - getting tired of my saying \\"gorgeous\\"?  That's what \\"Titanic\\" is like: trite and unimaginative at its core, but a great rollicking ride all the same. <br /> <br />The danger of this kind of movie, I think, is that it PURPORTS to be a \\"great\\" work of cinema; it's HERALDED as such; it wins Academy Awards, for heaven's sake, as such - and so the audience is roped into believing the lie.  And, heartbreakingly, maybe forgets - or, worse, never realizes - what great cinema truly IS. <br /> <br />But grab the popcorn, never forget that this is fluff, accept it on that basis, set your brain to \\"chill,\\" surrender to a delicious soap-opera-cum-epic, and enjoy without guilt, because there really is plenty to enjoy - which is why \\"Titanic\\" is in my DVD cabinet next to the likes of \\"Goodfellas,\\" \\"Jaws,\\" \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" \\"In America,\\" \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" and \\"Taxi Driver.\\"**   <br /> <br />And then go watch a GREAT film, just for balance (or to kick-start your brain again, if needed!). <br /> <br />**(In case anyone doesn't quite get the point, the foregoing ARE all truly great works of cinema.)
020161622X|5.0|This book will make you a better developer; there's no question about it. It's divided into well defined units which could be read independently. This is great because you can pick up the book and read a random section and absord something each and every time.     The topics in this book are all over the map. From Testing to Automation to Source Control to Communication, Dave Thomas and Andrew Hunt cover the essentials of how to be good developer (not just programmer).     I strongly recommend this book for Computer Science majors who have not yet joined the professional software industry. Many of us are taught how to do some code and other theoretical things that we might never end up using, but when it comes down to it, we do not get taught anything about software development; these are things we have to learn on our own accord. For example, source control is essential in any project, but I have worked with a CS senior who just refused to use CVS because it was 'too complicated'.     This book is a great starting point for such aspects of development. Get it. And read it more than once.
B0000542DH|5.0|The saying that a picture says more than a thousand words only appears as a mirage for many in our contemporary society where a constant feed of information waters down the message of a single picture.  Through voices over the radio, myriads of images flash from TV and the easily accessible Internet that can even generate any desired interactive multimedia.  The bombardment of information makes it difficult for many viewers to focus their attention on one single source, as an overload of sensory stimuli enter the brain through vision and hearing.  Soon can the spectators of a media source probably also smell and touch what they see.  It becomes an impossible task for many viewers to process the abundance of incoming information, which never allows enough time for reflection and contemplation.  Instead, today's youth are overmedicated for a vast number of cognitive disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and personality disorders due to problems with skills such as thinking and mood swings.  Oliver Stone addresses this issue through his controversial Natural Born Killers where two young people drive down a highway on a murderous rampage.<br /><br />In the opening, Stone displays a number of shots that have been edited together in order to create a threatening sensation, as a shot of the desert supercedes the image of a wolf.  A quick cut to a close-up of a rattle snake is followed by someone pouring a cup of coffee that quickly changes to a blood red scene of a train that is running through the desert.  A sequence of an eagle, which is a symbolic image for the United States, leads the viewer eventually to a dinner where the waitress quickly jumps through a number of television channels.  The different TV channels have an iconic lead up from the 1950s when the television become prominent in every home to present time where a demon is grinning on the screen.  A titled pan, suggests that something is not right with situation, and displays the waitress taking the order of Mickey (Woody Harrelson) who orders a slice of key-lime pie.  The waitress comes on to Mickey and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) insultingly brushes off her attempt while strutting up to the jukebox.  Shortly after hell breaks loose in the small diner along the desert highway where Mickey and Mallory, also known as M & M, ruthlessly kill all, but one who will spread the word of their act at the diner.<br /><br />The question is why Mickey and Mallory did what they did at the highway diner.  Instead of dealing with their identity, the Natural Born Killers try to answer the question through a lengthy dissection of their lives that stretch from the time they met until the very final scene.  Empirically the story stirs up several issues including sensationalism, i.e., the basic notion of limiting experience to sensations from the senses as a source of knowledge, as filtering consistent facts or extensive contemplation requires cerebral effort to achieving knowledge.  Instead people have been taught through the media to rely on feelings, as the ultimate truth, and the images of the TV most often pleads to the instant emotional senses.  Consequently, the viewer learns that they do not have to think, which requires cerebral effort, as they merely have to lay down in their La-Z-Boy and be spoon fed the images of the TV screen.<br /><br />A paradox rests within the image, as every image consists of both an instant emotional sensation and a deeper meaning.  However, in order for the audience to achieve some understanding of the deeper meaning in an image the audience's attention has to maintain on the image for enough time for the viewer to begin contemplation.  Education, of sorts, is also necessary in regards to reading images and to begin pondering, as the image has some links with society and to find this link individuals might need some acquired knowledge to find the cue that leads to a deeper meaning.  Parents are the foundation for a child's educationaldevelopment, and Stone ironically depicts this family in a dysfunctional Cosby manner where the unemployed father, performed by Rodney Dangerfield, only cares for Mallory in a selfish, physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive manner.  Both Mallory and Mickey know that something is wrong with the situation, and the approach they choose to end this terrible family lifestyle is with murder.  Mallory appears as a mirror image of her father after she has drowned her father in the fish tank by displaying her instant gratification of her deed by jumping up and down.  It is clear that her father did not care about any consequences, as she continues in his footsteps without regard for others except Mickey.<br /><br />Natural Born Killers depicts a brutal satire of our contemporary society where instant gratification seems to be the need in the public and media gladly provide it through their network stations, as commercials keep the dollars flowing.  Oliver Stone points out that the problem does not rest within the TV stations, parents, or the children, but in the society as a whole.  There is no magic silver bullet that could cure this cerebral apathy, as only individual endeavors to strive for deeper reflection and contemplation could raise the society beyond the need for instant emotional gratification.  On occasion, people demonize, maybe due to a sensation such as anger or their personal desire for their own 15 minutes of glory.  It could also be due to small aspects of society where they might not have gained full understanding of the issue through contemplation of consistent information.  Amidst the frenzy generated by the media, the media tries to maximize their revenue, as they provide more fuel to the sensational experience.  Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.) does exactly this by pleading to people's feelings as he tries to get the ratings to soar through an interview with Mickey.<br /><br />Technically Natural Born Killers offers a cinematically stunning experience, as it mockingly uses tilted camera pans and vertical cuts to induce more emotional turmoil.  This enhances the message that Stone tries to send to the audience through Quentin Tarantino's adapted story.  In order to provide a film that does not confuse the audience about his intentions to display a mockery of the media's sensationalistic abuse and the viewer's perception of media he uses a heavy load of satire backed by wacky cinematography and short animation sequences.  The cast also displays intentionally exaggerated performances that support the use of satire, which in the end comes together into a wickedly brutal parody with disturbing imagery presented through excessive violence and symbolic imagery.ional development, and Stone ironically depicts this family in a dysfunctional Cosby manner where the unemployed father, performed by Rodney Dangerfield, only cares for Mallory in a selfish, physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive manner.

B00004XQP4|4.0|Warning, the band's 4th studio album is their most inventive breaking away from the short punk-pop formula that gave them success in the first place. The album starts off with the ingenious Warning, booming acoustics throughout. The next three songs really appeal to any teenage girl with catchy, bubble gummy refrains, with that o so cute face of Billy Joe Armstrong. Misery totally and utterly blew me away, that song could appeal to a wide audience ranging from polka-lovers to hardcore-punkers. The use of the mandolin and ACCORDIAN is sooo cunning. Then as the praise of certain demise with the playing of an accordian is over we are taken to 3 more songs relating back to their punk roots. But just as I am ready to usher in another vulgar ballad of teenage angst there comes the album's 3 of 4 singles some of their utter and absoulute best, except for Waiting of course a song I'd rather forget; listen to a sample of that crap and you'll understand. Besides some of the filler on this album this shows once again they are more flexible than the standard three-chord punk rock producing a sound which is not heard at all today. Not exactly a classic but worth a spot in anyone's music library.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I read many reviews & watched both discs several times critically & with an open heart before writing my review. I read Emmy's & Gerry's interviews on the web and I even went so far to view Gerry's astrology chart, hey it was there on the web to see and the man turns me on in so many levels, so what the heck. Let's not mince words, Gerry's voice warbles in parts, absolutely soars in others. Emmy's voice wasn't consistent either, so vocal experience has nothing to do with it. The rock quality is there in this Phantom, no question, and I love that about this movie. I relate to this story on many levels though I have tried so hard not to give in... heh heh. I have been learning Phantom myself as part of my own vocal training, so I understand how it goes. You have to have ear, emotion, practice, some technical skill, some understanding of anatomy and what to do with it, you have to warm up, you also have to have heart, and quality. Like Gerry, my career changed direction. I'm glad this movie came out when it did. It was hard for me to feel the music I was supposed to be learning without ever having seen the theatrical version. Gerry made Phantom history; his performance IS a milestone in the art and interpretation of this awesome story of passion, loss, and life. Adding a rock sound to the Phantom's voice is not a crime. Rock is about breaking barriers and I love the way this movie invites young people learning voice training onto this edge, this wonderful spear between classical sound, richness to the ear, and rock opera. It's beautiful, sumptious, romantic, painful, releasing, rich, edgy, genius, I love it, and I know there are young composers out there who will see this movie, get inspired, and start on a highway in life that will create even new milestones in music history. And Gerry's astrology chart? One look at his chart and I knew why he made such a great phantom. I left this movie finally getting it, just getting it. Though phantom has felt such pain and loss, he lived like a zoo animal as a child for pete's sake, he is greatful to have had this mirror of her innocence held up to him, just the first lovely person he's ever come across in the highway of life. I love the new song Webber added for the film; it drives the story home, and I can't wait to learn it. And gawd, if Englishmen are this hot this single United States Air Force nurse is signing up for a tour in London!he lived like a zoo animal as a child for pete's sake, he is greatful to have had this mirror of her innocence held up to him, just the first lovely person he's ever come across in the highway of life.

B000005JA8|5.0|The first time I heard Trout Mask, when I was 15 years old, I thought it was the worst thing I'd ever heard. I said to myself, they're not even trying! It was just a sloppy cacophony. <br /> <br />Then I listened to it a couple more times, because I couldn't believe Frank Zappa could do this to me - and because a double album cost a lot of money. About the third time, I realised they were doing it on purpose: they meant it to sound exactly this way. About the sixth or seventh time, it clicked in, and I thought it was the greatest album I'd ever heard. <br /> <br />I played Trout Mask for my blues-loving friends, who all went through the same reaction I had, and we'd sit around saying, Wow, if this is how great pop music is in 1969, just think what it'll be like in 1984! Of course, we didn't realise this was the best album of 1984... and it remains the best rock album I've ever heard. <br /> <br />I saw him perform in 1970, when he came to the Paramount Theater in Portland, Oregon, and all seventy-five weirdos in the city showed up. These were the people the hippies had rejected. I remember the lights dimmed, and then Ed Marimba came out with a plastic toy raygun, pulled the trigger a few times to make sparks, and intoned the words 'Raygun, raygun' over and over again . . . finally concluding with 'Ronnie Raygun', who was already Governor of California. Then Drumbo came out and they played a duet for a while, and finally the whole band walked on. It was the best concert I've ever seen, easily. <br /> <br />In 1975, at the very end of an orchestral concert that Frank Zappa did at UCLA, I remember Don came out after the orchestra left the stage and just started blowing his soprano sax. After the show, a couple of friends and I tracked him down and had lunch with him. He showed us this incredible sketchbook, full of stuff that was for more figurative than anything he does nowadays. One of the friends I was with actually bought a picture of a trout that he'd drawn. He got quite nervous when she offered to buy it and called his wife to check that it was OK. Not long ago, I went to a private view of his paintings in Santa Monica and he was there. But by that time weirdness had become hip, so he was surrounded by every hipster weirdo in L.A. And in any case, I got waylaid by Henry Rollins.

I really liked Rachel and was not a big fan of Darcy so I was not sure how I was going to like Something Blue because it is now Darcys turn to tell the story.<br /><br />When Something Blue opens we find Darcy pregnant, alone, and still the type of woman who wants the world to fall at her feet. Feeling alone and rejected, Darcy ends up flying off to England to stay with a childhood friend and attempts to start over again with a new life and love.<br /><br />I was never a fan of Darcy but I will tell you by the end of Something Blue, she does grow up and becomes a much better person and this was a fun book to read.

B00005JLEX|5.0|I discovered again this show by chance during a business trip in USA, an evening when I was browsing through the TV channels. I knew it already because Italian RAI used to broadcast this sitcom some years ago, but it was a flop: first of all because all foreign movies and programs are dubbed in Italy, so basically you lose most of the funny jokes and lines, and second of all because (this is just my opinion) maybe this show is way too American, too \\"New-Yorkish\\", if I may say so. Personally, after I watched some episodes in the original version, I totally fell in love with it. I find it extremely funny, the characters are very well designed and I especially like George Costanza, because it reminds me of a lot of people (including myself a little), this bald not-so-attractive man in his mid-thirties, with so many flaws (he is greedy, he has no idea how to relate with other persons in general and how to approach women in particular, he always puts himself in incredible situations; he is constantly complaining about other people being insensitive, but he is insensitive exactly in the same way). I have just watched the episode in which George has to replace the cassette in the answering machine of a woman he's dating and I almost died laughing, he is absolutely hilarious. Even though the situations are sometimes obviously incredible, these characters are so human, and while you are watching the show you think that this might someday happen to you in reality. I understand many people complain about the fact that  the show is \\"about nothing\\". So what? Most of the time our lives are about nothing; I personally like the way this show approaches serious issues in a funny way. We all need to laugh every now and then.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I will admit that when I first listened to this album I was like damn not as good as AROBTTH.  But after many many listens I have realized that this is just as good or possibly even better.  I live in Canada and have recently seen coldplay play live at muchmusic with only about 300 other people.  With the intimate setting the songs really hit home especially #1 Square one which is one of my personal favs, #4 Fix you which they ended their set on which was incredible and finally #8 A message was also awesome.  I do not understand why people could possibly give this album only one or two stars when this band is easily making some of the best music in the entire world.  To you radiohead fans the bends is an amazing cd but OK computer is one of the most overrated pieces of crap ever.  Coldplay have surpassed the likes of Radiohead with this one and who knows what the future will bring for the british quartet.
6305508550|5.0|This is one of the best films of the tawdry late 90's era.  It is fitting that Mike Judge should be director of one of the all time greatest comedy movies from that time.  It is perfect in that so many people can relate to it.  It also has a brilliant, understated edge to it that grows on you as the movie keeps going.<br /><br />It is the story of a vastly overworked, inefficient office that is bursting with problems right under the surface.  Our main protagonist takes some advice and visits a hyponist, whereupon all sorts of trouble ensues.  Eventually, things culminate in one of the workers getting some gasoline and burning the whole building down to the ground.<br /><br />Along the way we get some perfect late 90's/00's moments, from the white guy who listens to hardcore gangsta rap to the guy with the \\"O face\\" it just all rocks.  Really just one of the best films of that entire era.

At first I really didn't like it at all, so I left it in my player in my truck and half-way listened to it whenever I drove somewhere. But it wasn't long until I had to bring it in the house so I could listen to it more. Then I had to make a copy to keep in my truck and have the other one in the house. The songs on \\"Reload\\" are the kind that tend to grow on you, and will go round and round in your head with enough listenings. And given a chance, you may find yourself liking, or even loving, this album, even if you intially hate it. I have worn out 2 \\"Reload\\" cassettes, so I just bought it again on CD.<br /><br />I have loved Metallica since \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\" but I don't really care to listen to their pre-\\"Black Album\\" thrashy stuff anymore, save for the \\"Justice For All\\" one every now and then. 20 yrs ago in my head-bangin' thrash-around days, I probably wouldn't have liked Reload very much, but now it is my 2nd favorite Metallica album (\\"S&M\\" is my favorite). I guess I have progressed in music taste at about the same rate and in the same direction Metallica's sound progressed (except for \\"St Anger\\", but that's a whole 'nother reveiw). That is not to say that this is album is \\"soft\\", for that it is not-- and even the softer side of Metallica is way heavier than any grunge rock band around.<br /><br />If you love the Black album, you'll probably like enough songs on Reload to make it worth the money. If you were disappointed by Metallica's change of style on the Black album, this one will probably disappoint you even more. If you kinda liked \\"Load\\" you may like \\"Reload\\" better, I did.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Alas!  Simeone read the comic book.  And understood it.  Great story, efx, acting, sets, costumes (sans nipples) and a descent Bruce Wayne and Batman in the same movin' picture.  Plus this one is not all about the villain.  And there is really only one major villain, no Robin, no kittys, no Batgirl!!!  Great job all around on this one.  I'm looking foward to many more like this one.  Oh no, did I jinx it?
0778320448|5.0|If you've not knitted before you read this book, you will want to afterward. This is a feel-good women's book about four very different women who become friends while taking a knitting class from one of them. Lydia Hoffman, twice a cancer survivor, opens A Good Yarn on the last Tuesday of April (any current year). The buildings on Blossom Street, where the store is located, are being renovated, a major undertaking in this particular Seattle neighborhood. Lydia advertises for interested parties to participate in a knitting class on Friday afternoons. Jacqueline Donovan, Carol Girard and Alix (yes, with an \\"i\\") take her up on her offer. Jacqueline is a major b..../snob whose marriage has been cold for years and who intensely dislikes her new daughter-in-law who has had the audacity to become pregnant; Carol Girard and her husband, Doug, are desperate for a baby; and Alix Townsend is a troubled girl who still dreams of a boy she \\"loved\\" in sixth grade.<br /><br />These four women grow together over the course of about nine months, and we, the readers, accompany them on their journey of growth as individuals, a group, and as knitters. There is a pattern for a baby blanket given at the front of the book and it is also the first project the women undertake in their class. Macomber also occasionally throws in a pithy saying about knitting, such as \\"In the hands of a knitter, yarn becomes the medium that binds the heart and soul,\\" attributed to Robin Villiers-Furze, The Needleworks Company, Port Orchard, Washington.<br /><br />Macomber's writing style is easy and the story flows well. Her formatting style is to alter chapters by woman; something here about Lydia, something there about Jacqueline, and so on. Oh, and then there's the guys...and what guys they are. Brad Goetz falls in love with Lydia, Reese Donovan still loves his wife, Doug Girard is one patient fellow, and Jordan Turner, well, he's just A-OK! After digesting this book for a few days, I've decided that among the general flavor of the book which I liked a great deal, one of the best things about The Shop on Blossom Street was the guys! What a terrific bunch of hunks, all loving and patient and hot! I'd take any one of the four of them.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hillong the general flavor of the book which I liked a great deal, one of the best things about The Shop on Blossom Street was the guys!

B00005JNJT|5.0|If you've seen the first 4 films in the Batman series and go see \\"Begins\\" expecting for it to expand on what you already know, you're in for some disappointment.  If you're a fan of the animated series, before Robin/Nightwing and Batgirl of course, this is for you. Batman is dark, mysterious, and drives a car that looks like a Lamborghini and a tank's love child.  <br /> <br />I'm looking forward to the next movie in this revamped series. This is how it should've started 15 years ago, except Christian Bale was probably still in elementary school back then. I hear he's also interested in sequels, so keep it coming!
B00008G8LW|3.0|The Abyss is a great movie and I definitely recommend checking it out. However if you are going to get it you might as well get the Special Edition or the Double Digipack versions of the DVD. This one just has the theatrical release of the movie. That's all. You don't get both versions of the film, including the extended version with 20+ minutes of additional footage (well worth sitting through) nor the incredibly compelling documentaries and extras that are truly worth having.     Considering the low price of the Special Edition there is absolutely no reason why you should go for this non-extras, non-extented edition format. Do yourself a favor and trade up.
B000001Y5X|5.0|You can say you don't like this guy, you can say you don't like the genre of music, but no matter what you say, this is a very good rock album both musically and lyrically. I always find it funny just how many people are offended by this guy. He is laughing his way all the way to the bank. Anyway, this was the album that put him on the map. I actually miss the early days of MM. His newer stuff isn't quite as heavy sounding or as gritty as this album. Yea, I like MM, so what?
B0002M3V0C|5.0|This particular Bonus Track, \\"Ragdoll\\" is so good that it makes this CD worth every penny I paid for it.  I can listen to this over and over and not get tired of it.  There are not many bands that are worth actually buying the cd as opposed to downloading the few good songs on any given cd.  M5 is worth buying anything that they come out with.  I highly recommend lending your ear to the sweet sounds.

0915811774|5.0|This is an excellent book to raise your awareness of how you relate coming from a place of heart, and not ego, which is the destroyer of relatioships. This is a great book if you really want to find spiritual answers that can help you in your love life. The author did a fantastic job to elevate your consciouness to a higher level, so that your relationships can reflect that truth. This is one of the books on my recommendation list, and it's a beautiful read!

068987474X|3.0|There's not a whole lot of relationship advice in this book. There are some helpful passages about guys games that they play, and the book is funny, like the show Sex in the City, but it really does not give any in depth answers. This is NOT a serious relationship book. It is a fun to read book, but if you want more in depth answers in relationships, this book just doesn't have them.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|Sometimes when you walk into a sequel, you have to live with the fact that unless you've already seen the orinigal, you have a lot of catching up to do. This isn't the case with Ghost In The Shell 2. Fans of the original \\"will\\" notice the subtle nods the characters give in the plot to the first movie, but basically you don't miss a beat if this is your first Ghost In the Shell movie. The sequel raises the bar on animation as well as philosophy. Really the main thing that you come away from this movie is the philosophy. There's just as much time spent shooting guns and knocking out robots as there is spent contemplating the human and robot intellectual condition.  <br /> <br />If you aren't a fan of anime, take heart, neither am I, and I still found this movie to be superior to some live action films I've seen. Don't listen to the negative reviews from people who are jaded about anime, they are just being old school know it alls with a lot of bile for a genre they've exhausted. Ghost in the Shell is incredible, and thankfully not too long (one of my usual complaints about anime).
0767800958|1.0|This film was so disappointing. I love tango. And Buenos Aires. If it wasn't for both of these elements in the film...it would get no stars. Sally Potter is so self indulgent. The story is so discredible....that we are supposed to believe this young guy has a romantic attachment to her?! Perhaps if she had cast a younger female for the lead role this may have been more believeable. The actual 'plot' was so weak...nothing happens in the whole film except she learns tango and wrecks my head.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|While I think this album is more thought provoking and interesting than most other albums out right now, I can't help but think it's less thought provoking and interesting than SOAD's other efforts. Much has been made of Daron Malakian's increased presence on this CD, and the consensus seems to be true: his voice and his lyrics just aren't of Serj Tankian caliber.<br /><br />What I love about SOAD is how heavy, or hard, or however you want to word it, the music is, while at the same time capturing a profound sense of beauty. Lyrically, songs like Deer Dance, Toxicity, and even many of the songs from their \\"throw-away\\" album of extras, Steal This CD, achieve greatness. And, Serj's voice is so moving, so piercing..once you hear SOAD at their best, you'll not soon forget them.<br /><br />Which brings me to Mezmerize. Musically, this album is incredible. Lyrically, it's sub par. I made a list of the songs I liked best on the CD, and then went to the booklet. My favorites were the ones with ST's name listed under the title. I'm not making this up. Musically, DM is a powerhouse--a genius. And sure, I have fun singing \\"Tony Danza cuts in line\\" and my husband gets a kick out of hearing his wife belt out \\"My c*ck is much bigger than yours!\\" but it just doesn't mean anything. And I'm not saying that everything has to mean something--that every song has to be an anthem or moving piece of musical history. Please. But, I think the good should outweigh the bad--the reverent should outweigh the irreverent--and with the exceptions of B.Y.O.B., Revenga, Sad Statue and Lost in Hollywood, this album is practically forgettable.<br /><br />I have hope for Hypnotize--where Serj Tankian's voice and spirit may again be given the chance to shine brighter than most.
B000002AGN|5.0|As to say, Dave Brubeck is such a genius. Y'know he can kick his hearts out when he's making music today. I'm blessed that I picked this on the mail @ Jazz Heritage for .99 each (y'know a discount off the regular price which 6.99, 7.99 or sumthin like that.) Well don't have to get too much detail. Ok back to the album as I said this is sure is good start for all jazz lovers especially jazz-beginners for those that are involved into other music like rock, rap, hip-hop, gospel, R&B, maybe even classical or opera, etc. For those who were involved into the classic breakthroughs of Miles Davis' KIND OF BLUE, John Coltrane's MY FAVORITE THINGS, BLUE TRAIN, A LOVE SUPREME, etc., Ray Charles' GENIUS OF RAY CHARLES, GENIUS + SOUL = JAZZ/MY KIND OF JAZZ, Quincy Jones' THIS IS HOW I FEEL ABOUT JAZZ, WALKING IN SPACE, QUINTESSANCE, Q LIVE IN PARIS, etc., Duke Ellington's BLACK BROWN AND BEIGE, JAZZ PARTY, ANATOMY OF A MURDER SOUNDTRACK, LIVE AT NEWPORT '56, Count Basie's THE ATOMIC COUNT BASIE, FIRST TIME: THE COUNT MEETS THE DUKE, incl. similar other albums like Marvin Gaye's WHAT'S GOING ON, TROUBLE MAN SOUNDTRACK, THE MOODS OF MARVIN GAYE, M.P.G, A TRIBUTE TO NAT KING COLE, LET'S GET IT ON, any Stevie Wonder album from SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE, TALKING BOOK, MUSIC OF MY MIND, FULLFILLING FIRST FINALE, ORIGINAL MUSIQUARIUM, AT THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY, the 2-album anthology set LOOKING BACK ('cuz it's been out-of-print for yrs. and seeking to be re-issued pretty soon, I still have the 2 cassette tapes which are completely a bit worn out but not all the time but ready to get 'nother 1 as necessary on gemm.com or maybe on either @ the used music stores or thrift stores which I go all the time. 'nuff said), or maybe even into the jazz-rap evolution of Common's RESURRECTION, LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE, ONE DAY IT'LL ALL MAKE SENSE, or even the latest BE, Tribe Called Quest's 3+ classic albums from PEOPLE..., LOW END, and MARAUDERS, Digable Planets, Guru, Gang Starr, Dream Warriors,Jeru the Damaja, K-oS, Talib Kweli, Black Eyed Peas, Fresh Prince and DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ronny Jordan, The Rebirth of Cool Series, Us3, The Fugees, OutKast, Impromp2, Jazzhole, just to name a few. Y'know there's alot 'mo recommend u gotta have and hold on to if u wanna be a part of the curriclum of jazz and popular music. 'Specially classical which I totally put down. <br /> <br />Ok while listening to the album, I hear the two type'a songs that everybody's been talkin' and Dave Brubeck was best known 4 \\"Blue Rondo a La Turk\\" (once remade by my man Mr. Al Jarreau, who is also a pleasure to listen, enjoy and relax w/ his music, love how he scats and sings on everything, I dig him alot. Y'know it's off the 1981 platinum disc BREAKIN AWAY which I have 'cuz it's my all-time favorite jazz album in the world since George Benson whom I listen to alot 'cuz he's my main artist) and then \\"Take Five\\" which alot a ppl been remaking all over the yrs and was written by one of the members of the Dave Brubeck Quartet who passed in 1977 is Mr. Paul Desmond, the alto saxophonist, who went on to perform solo acts on his own and collaborating w/ other artists as well. He sure has unique style and much focus to his playing ability and improvising. As w/ the rest of the members like Eugene Wright on bass and Joe Morello all have a twist when they're doin rhythm on each melody and song they perform w/ Dave who is the leader of the quartet or maybe Paul would be the leader by any chance. I may need to research that a lil bit more.  <br /> <br />Ok that's gonna wrap it up 4 me. I may do another review which I haven't started yet on this album. Same w/ Miles Davis' albums, John Coltrane, Grover Washington, Marvin Gaye, Quincy Jones, 2Pac, Mase, etc. which I do now on Epinions whether I'm not on Amazon all the time. You can catch me doin' alot 'mo reviews at my own website from Epinions at [...] <br /> <br />This 1959 masterpiece which I said will stand time in the jazz industry and mostly in popular music for days, months and yrs. to come. This was recorded the same yr. when Miles Davis' put out KIND OF BLUE, Duke Ellington put out JAZZ PARTY, Charles Mingus put on MINGUS AH UM, among others. I had on my mind one day that I may be a composer, conductor, arranger, producer you know doing local acts or songs for other artists all around the area 'cross the country. Even tho I real good playing the trumpet, I got the ability to lead a band or lead a choir or sumthin like that also. God bless my heart.
B00005JNJT|5.0|This is the best Batman movie yet. Although I enjoyed the earlier movies, I didn't think they really did justice to the original Batman, whose leap from the printed pages to the silver screen didn't quite seem to work out and the Batman concept suffered as a result. Here we see a much more realistic version of Batman that is much truer to the original and not some Hollywood vision that is more of a parody. It owes a lot to graphic novels such as Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, as the Batman character here is a more complex individual, and a darker and more troubled one at that, perhaps reflecting the darker and more troubled Gotham City he has returned to protect. I won't say anymore except that the whole movie takes the previous ones a quantum leap up in terms of a quality script, good acting, and much better storyline and plot. Overall, a good movie that finally does justice to the Caped Crusader and worth seeing on the big screen instead of waiting for it to come out on video.

1401201911|5.0|Both one of the best concets DC has ever come up with for the Elseworlds concept of tales entirely removed from DCU continuity, and utterly flawless in its execution; an instant classic that's still going to be vital centuries from now. <br /> <br />As the title implies, \\"Superman: Red Son\\" takes on the 'what if' notion of the Man Of Steel's lifepod having come down in the late 30s in the Soviet Union instead of the Kansas.  Fitting in with the time frame, Superman and most of the other characters (with the notable exception of Batman, who more resembles his current self) in the saga are much more in keeping with their decades-ago incarnations than their current post-Crisis selves, with Superman light years more powerful than in current continuity (back to the days when he was practically omnipotent) and Lex Luthor seeming to be about ten times smarter than Einstein and Hawking combined.  I don't think these characterizations/attributes could ever fly (no pun intended) on a long-term basis in the modern, highly-detailed and plausibilty-concerned universes, but it has proved to work spectacularly in a self-contained Elseworlds tale such as this. <br /> <br />Random high points: there are so many open-to-interpretation/subtext points it would be impossible to mention them all here (besides it would give away pretty much the whole story) but it does provide invigorating fodder for conversation and wonder.  There are a host of familiar DCU characters who turn up along the way, some in major roles and for others small cameos, and again it would be grossly unfair to give even a partial list of the surprise players here.  And the art and the way it conveys what's going on inside the character's minds without a word in some panels - you'll see a prime example when you get to Pages 134-135 near the end of the book; if this was a movie the actors would deserve awards for conveying so much and with such force.  And finally, only rarely does the tale go where one would expect it to; truly one of the more unpredictable epics out there. <br /> <br />Possibly THE indispensable Elseworlds.
B00005JL96|5.0|When this movie came out, I asked someone from Hawaii about it and her response was that in Hawaii they have a name for a woman like Nani, someone who's always doing the wrong thing...but for the life of me I can't remember the term. I'd rather focus on the movie.<br /><br />There are so many great moments in this film, and some revolutionary--for Disney--elements:<br /><br />--A girl who doesn't have \\"marry the hero\\" as her whole character arc (although Belle comes close) and her male fixations are limited to Stitch and Elvis<br />--No talking animal sidekicks (although Pocahontas didn't have talking animals)<br />--No breaking into song, except for Elvis dance routines<br />--Strong matriarchs, e.g. Grand Councilwoman, Lilo, Nani<br />--A woman with a real figure and a Jennifer Lopez rear<br />--A mother-figure household without a wicked stepmother<br /><br />For years with the exception of Peter Pan, Disney kills off the mothers or leaves them powerless--though Queen Sarabi's regal dignity in \\"The Lion King\\" is memorable. Lilo's parents are dead, but Nani is the mother figure--and not a good one at that. Nani and Lilo act bratty for half the film until the destructive Stitch explodes into their lives--but oddly leaves them better off than they were.<br /><br />The one character I disliked intensely in this film (and in the series) is Mertle. She is the stereotypical awful popular girl who is rude to Lilo. True, Lilo's in need of coping skills, but one can't help but think that even the intelligent Lilo has her breaking point when subjected to Mertle's pettiness.<br /><br />By contrast, Dr. Jumba, Cobra Bubbles, and the Niles Crane-like Pleakley come off as all doing their best to do their duty. While Dr. Jumba isn't repentant about his experiments, he does do his duty trying to capture 626/Stitch. Pleakley is your typical fussbudget. Captain Gantu is your career officer.<br /><br />Cobra Bubbles, who we learn is X-Filesish, just does his duty by Lilo in taking a hard line with Nani.

B0007OCG4W|5.0|Let me begin by saying that \\"Closer\\" is the kind of film that you've gotta see for yourself to decide if you like it. Half the time I see reviews by people who loved the film, and half the time I see reviews by people who absolutely despised it. I, myself, loved it. <br /> <br />\\"Closer\\" is the story of four individuals: obituary writer and struggling author Dan (Jude Law), waitress and ex-stripper Alice (Natalie Portman), popular photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) and dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen). Dan and Alice meet in London after Alice is hit by a car. A few months later, Dan is being photographed for his novel by Anna, and the two fall in love - but only Dan will admit it. Trying to get back at Anna, he pretends to be her on an Internet sex chat and tells Larry to meet her at an aquarium for sex. By chance, the real Anna is at the aquarium; she meets Larry and the two fall in love. <br /> <br />Eventually, Alice leaves Dan and Anna leaves Larry. By the end of the film, each man has had sex with each woman and vice versa; they seem to love whomever they're with, but in reality they only love their original partner. <br /> <br />I'd heard good things about this film before watching it, but after watching it the first time I was disappointed. While it was no doubt a fine film, there was more sexual dialog than I could have ever imagined! Now I can tolerate sexuality in a movie just as much as the next guy, but when the film becomes unrealistically sexual than I become fed up with it. And \\"Closer\\" seemed to be just that. But now, having watched the movie numerous more times, I realize that the film is abnormally sexual, but not necessarily overly sexual. Would it have been better without so much sexuality? Yes. But the rest of the film makes up for it. Oh yes, does it ever. <br /> <br />Patrick Marber's script is adapted from Marber's popular, award-winning play. The script is witty, intelligent and original. There are some great lines, which come from characterswho seem very real. <br /> <br />The acting is one of the film's high points. Jude Law is terrific as Dan, who tries to be mean but just can't pull it off. He makes the character a target for sympathy from the audience. Natalie Portman is, as always, very good, as Alice. Julia Roberts, while good, doesn't give the best performance of her career; it feels like she's not putting in a huge amount of effort. Clive Owen is outstanding as always; Owen's performance has made Larry my favorite character in the film. He really brings out the bad side of Larry, but he's likable at the same time. There's a certain air of mysticism around Larry, like you never know what he's going to do next. Interestingly, Owen played Law's part in the original stage play. <br /> <br />Mike Nichols proves that his directorial talent hasn't faded one bit since he made the 1967 classic \\"The Graduate\\" - in fact, Nichols seems better than ever. He gives the film a cold, hard feeling, but at times he seems to loosen up - much like the characters themselves. He really captures the darkness of Patrick Marber's script. <br /> <br />The few songs on the soundtrack are excellent, but the one that really stands out is \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" by Damien Rice. It's used for the film's theme, and there isn't another song in the world that is so perfect for this movie as \\"Blower's Daughter\\". The song is absolutely beautiful; the sad, determined strength found in the lyrics matches the film well. <br /> <br />\\"Closer\\" is closer to perfection than any romantic-drama has ever come. If you're looking for a soft romance like \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" or \\"Notting Hill\\", then this is probably not the movie for you. This is a mature, dark, grim look at romance, and I love it. \\"Closer\\" has become one of my favorite films. If you feel like watching the film and deciding for yourself how you feel, and you keep an open mind, then I applaud you.
0380789019|5.0|This has easily become one of my favorite books (if not \\"the\\" favorite). I simply became immersed in this underground world, and I could not put the book down for a second.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|\\"Closer\\" made me wonder: Why do I even bother watching movies? The nearly two hours I spent watching this could have been spent ... washing my hair? walking the dog? pondering life's many mysteries? <br /> <br />But NooOoooooOOOOooooo ... I had to spend that time watching the brutal interactions between four physically-appealing people talking trash to each other and always wanting that which they cannot have.  <br /> <br />If you must see Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in action, then watch this film not for the plot - which is transparent and cliche - but the ideas and questions that emerge. For instance, are people today taking intimacy for granted? When does emotional intimacy merge into falling in love?  <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but I will end with one final note: I liked how \\"Closer\\" had only a smidgeon of revealing flesh and sex scenes but left me feeling like I had just licked the pavement of Bourbon Street. Take heed. Words do have power.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I'm not much of a horror or gore fan, but there are two films from that genre which stand out for me.  One is John Carpenter's version of \\"The Thing\\", and the other is George Romero's \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\".  This set includes the original U.S. theatrical cut, Dario Argento's European cut, and an extended cut (previously billed as the \\"Director's Edition\\", which is a misnomer -- in fact, Romero prefers the U.S. theatrical cut).  The extended cut is longer (no kidding), and replaces much of the music from the Italian group \\"Goblin\\" with stock music. <br /> <br />This is a film that can still, even after years and repeated viewings, creep me out a bit.  The makeup effects are crude by today's standards, but the real scare here is psychological.  This was a film with which I would always ask \\"What would *I* do in this situation?\\"  Great characters in a great story with some underlying themes (not just a dump, gore flick), \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" is a fantastic film, and my favorite of Romero's \\"Dead\\" series (though I haven't seen the soon-to-be-released \\"Land Of The Dead\\"). <br /> <br />The 3 versions in this set each include a commentary track (the U.S. cut with Romero and wife, the Argento cut with producer Richard Rubenstein, and the extended cut with the main cast).  A fourth disk includes some documentary and behind-the-scenes material.  The packaging is also very well done. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of this film, you will love this set.  If you haven't seen the film and think you might like it, I'd suggest a rental of the U.S. cut.
B0002DB52M|1.0|This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time - and I'm including my most recent rental of \\"Ocean's Twelve.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Dogville\\" is a trite attempt at best to explore the depths of America's so-called xenophobic tendencies. But what concerns me more is that gratuitous rape scenes are considered an arty revolution by mainstream society. Are people saying that Nicole Kidman is only a good actress when she becomes a fetishized object? <br /> <br />There is nothing about this movie that interested me except for the fast-forward button on my remote control.
B000002LK1|5.0|If you have to own an electro pop album let it be this one.<br /><br />Depeche Mode rapidly evolved from their cheesy,though somewhat charming,new wave beginnings(remember\\"I just can't get enough\\")into stadium sized synth pop gods capable of turnig out an album as impressive as\\"Violator\\".<br /><br />So,how is \\"Violator\\" better than their other efforts?<br /><br />There are several reasons for the clear advantage of this album in comparison with the rest of their back catalog:<br /><br />1-Martin Gore's playing skills and Dave Gahan's singing had been honed to perfection in the years that preceded the album(mainly in their lengthy world tours)which reflects on the record's seamless flow.<br /><br />2-It has a dark vibe to it,enhancing the cool that oozes from every track.<br /><br />3-In its core are three of their most compelling songs-\\"Personal Jesus\\",\\"Waiting for the Night\\"and especially\\"Enjoy the Silence\\".<br /><br />4-The album has a sound of its own and these songs would feel out of place if not in the company in which they are.<br /><br />5-The songs feel real,genuine and heartfelt(check out the longing of \\"Enjoy the Silence\\")and not as some contrived,ersatz exaggeration typical to most electro pop bands(maybe syndrome of the cusp of the decade societyof then).<br /><br />Although the album marked a high water mark which they never again approached it still stands out as Depeche Mode's and electro pop's crowning glory.
B000669GAI|5.0|Don't listen to that garbage review below.  Pearl Jam is the best band of the past 15 years.  I like the music of Creed and everything, but the fact is they are Pearl Jam wannabees.  In my mind Pearl Jam is not grunge music anyway(neither is Creed), they are a straight up great rock band.  This cd gives you some of their greatest songs, if you like this buy more of their stuff, you will enjoy it.
B00082IJ08|5.0|In my humble opinion a huge leap foward from the first record which i honestly thought was way overrated. Here there is more style and focus- and the songs morphing from one thing to another really shows blur\\"s albarn is a crafty and skilled arranger. Alittle dub- some reggae-indie rock-pop- hiphop- really allover the place(even some brian wilson style melodies)- with more acoustic guitar and just stronger songs. The best record so far this year by any major act- retro sounds combined with interesting string arrangments- production is also topnotch. A fun but dark record that puts to shame most bands who claim to be experimental or risktakers. For a bunch of cartoon characters(the videos are great too) gorillaz are simply setting the bar alot higher. essential
B00005JNNZ|4.0|Samuel L. Jackson is one of our great actors, and he carries this film in much the same way that the real Ken Carter carried the Richmond High School team to their dreams.<br /><br />I see many reviews that complain that \\"all that school stuff\\" gets in the way of an otherwise good movie.  They miss the point.<br /><br />Ken Carter understands all too well (as is brought home in the film) that EXTREMELY few of the inner-city athletes are going to go on to fame and fortune in the nba(or any other professional league).  For those who don't become the next Lebron James life becomes a series of tough choices if you don't have \\"that school stuff\\" behind you.  Dead end job or life of crime?  High School drop outs (about 2/3 of the males in Richmond we're told in the movie) don't have good life or career choices.<br /><br />As an editorial comment: Something the film doesn't even start to address are those young \\"star\\" athletes who do \\"make it\\" - they have the skills to get to a professional league, then  sabotage themselves by resorting to behaviors they learned back in their neighborhoods while they weren't learning things like English - to allow them to speak to reporters and become product spokesmen, or Math - to allow them to track their money rather than relying on some smooth-talking Ivy Leaguer who takes control of their new fortunes. Or perhaps they can't help themselves from dabbling in drugs.... or guns.... Coach Carter's lessons would be an asset to pretty much all Americans.<br /><br />But I digress.  The point of \\"Coach Carter\\" is that our hero recognizes that things like hard work, education and character are the ONLY things that are going to separate the vast majority of his players from a life of promise and a life going nowhere.  We can only IMAGINE what the real Coach Carter thought when his attempts to instill these values into his players were met with resistance: not surprisingly from the players themselves, but also from their parents and, worst of all, from the school board as well.<br /><br />There are some exciting, fast-paced and well-played sequences in the film.  There are also moments when we get to see character being developed - or on display after it has been developed.  A documentary included on the is as encouraging as the film itself: we see players from that team 5 years later and they tell \\"where they are now\\".  One is in the ABA and the rest are in college.  Two of them have plans to become Doctors.  I don't know where Darryl Dawkins is now, but I'm guessing somewhere other than medical school.<br /><br />We're told that the year before Coach Carter arrived Richmond went 4 - 22.  I would argue that this story would be almost as remarkable if he had coached a team that ALSO lost 22 games.  The fact that he turned them into winners on AND off the court is all the more remarkable.  The fact that he did it for a part-time stipend of $1,500 salary is a noble achievement.<br /><br />It's encouraging to see characters in stand up for principles, even moreso in the face of adversity.  It's even more encouraging to see them do it for the benefit of others and for their community.<br /><br />The real Coach Carter provides a good story and great example, and the film \\"Coach Carter\\" does a good job of bringing us that story.

B0006L16N8|1.0|Coldplay has a nice solid sound that can be appealing as white noise in the background. Otherwise, this album has no substance. The lyrics are very, very weak. The tone, pace and feel is so similar across these tracks that it is nearly impossible to discern one song from another. As a matter of fact, so many of the songs have the same ryhme pattern and timing that it's almost like the writer kept trying to get it right in each successive song, but ended up with a string of indistinguishable clones. Coldplay has released a couple of good songs, but there are none on this album. At this point Coldplay is surviving on hype. There is little or no substance.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|I have always liked the Bee Gees but wouldn't have considered myself to have been a big fan.  This DVD might just have changed things.  It is a fantastic concert and everything about it is first class.  The music is great; the audio is excellent; the video makes you feel like you are at the concert. If you like the Bee Gees, buy it - you won't be disappointed.

Hit after hit after hit...for almost 3 hours! One song ends, another one starts! No documentaries between songs (take a hint here Paul McCartney). This is what a concert SHOULD be! Several encores! Great harmonies! Tight performances!    And the sound! They know how to put together a DVD release! The DTS sound is incredible! It's crisp! It kicks! Not only can you HEAR the music, but you can FEEL it as well!    This one belongs in your home DVD concert library! You won't be sorry you bought it.
B00005JNDZ|3.0|OK, as many have noted it is not as good as Bridget Jones's Diary, which is the gold standard in romantic comedies as far as I'm concerned. The Thailand plot is totally ludicrous with the only saving grace being a very sexy and snarky performance from Hugh Grant. Be prepared for more slapstick and physical humor from Renee Zellwegger (who pulls it off quite nicely) but not as much wit as the first film. However, as a major Colin Firth fan I have to recommend it because he appears much more frequently in this film than the first. There are a few times that he takes your breath away with his gorgeousness and of course there is the terrific second fight between him and Hugh Grant. Plus, if you purchase the DVD you'll find some very fun extras--a mock interview between the \\"real\\" Bridget Jones and Colin Firth, a dissection of the fight scene, a look at the CGI during one of the film's key scenes and a lot more.  <br /> <br />If you love Bridget Jones you're going to find some laughs from this and if you love Colin Firth you really shouldn't pass it up. Who's cuter than Mark Darcy?
B0006L16N8|1.0|This is cynical 'bored' room music meant to secure high earnings. Martin's half yawn, half yodel vocal style oozes a saccharine sweet sentimentality that many are sure to confuse as passion. Singer Chris Martin is beligerent to suggest that 'X&Y' is the album that will 'take out U2'. What a slap in the face to their idols.  <br /> <br />X&Y finds coldplay teetering between a paint by numbers U2 style and 1980's Ah-ha. It could also be called, clocks the remix album, as every song sounds the same. The music is ethereal, yet lugubrious and flacid. The coldplay formula is simple and by now overexposed.  <br /> <br />There is no real growth here. Perhaps coldplay have a future mining the past, but the new music shows no growth, or willingness to create. <br /> <br />U2... even Ah-ha need not worry, at least musically. Yodel-ay-he-hoo!!!!
0767802470|5.0|This film, at the very least, is the supreme granddaddy of all submarine movies. It towers over the genre like a colossus. For the submarine movie fan (a small but passionate and critical cult of which I admit to being a member) this film stands at the summit. No other film takes you below 200 meters, with the metal groaning and bolts flying, like this one does.<br /><br />Quick synopsis: Germany is beginning to lose the war. Her U-boat fleet, once a fearful pack of wolves prowling the Atlantic for Allied ships stuffed with supplies, has dwindled down to a few. The Allies have caught on to the wolf pack's game, and have taken to escorting their merchant ships with destroyers, which are turning U-boats into very silent coffins. Once all powerful hunters, the subs find themselves more often than not the hunted. Into this scene comes Das Boot, an aging type VII U-boat, sent out on a tour of the Atlantic.<br /><br />This is also one of the finest edge-of-your-seat thrillers ever made. I found myself more than once actually holding my breath. The cinematography is flawless, with the photographer Jost Vacano using a hand-held camera equipped with a gyroscopic mount and wearing a crash helmet and pads on his elbow and shines. Honest to God, in the depth charge scenes I felt my muscles going tight in anticipation of impact.<br /><br />How did they achieve such realistic footage of a World War II type VII U-boat? Well, set designer Rolf Zehetbauer found the plans for one at the Chicago Museum of Science and industry. Then he had the original men that built subs make a full-sized sea-going replica. That's how. I have to say again, if you are a fan of submarines, watching this boat slice through the surface can take your breath away.<br /><br />Really, this boat is the star of the film. Jurgen Prochnow, the flesh and blood star, holds his own, though, and then some, perfectly capturing the near mystical discipline and doom of an Atlantic U-boat captain. Many other crew members turn in amazing performances as well. In the end, it is a movie one seems to live through rather than watch. The movie never falters from (as the journalist/witness in the film says in describing his experience) \\"reality . . . in all its cruelty and grandeur.\\"<br /><br />If you wonder if the \\"director's cut\\" is worth it, stop wondering and buy it. As a rule, I am not a fan of special edition director's cuts of my favorite movies. I often find them slow and much too full of a director's ego. Not here. This version has an extra 60 minutes that director Wolfgang Petersen felt was important to make it a \\"perfect film.\\" He was right. Some of the characters are fleshed out just enough. This director's version, for all its added length, doesn't have a dead spot. Indeed, the extra minutes only serve to somehow tighten the tension screws.<br /><br />Wolfgang Petersen touched the stars on this one and created a classic.<br />- Mykal Bantas as well.

B00003CWL6|1.0|SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS <br /> <br />I love Kevin Spacey.  I thought this film would be a great spotlight for him. <br /> <br />I was wrong. <br /> <br />There isn't a whole lot in this movie that's redeeming.  The premise is that American suburbia has this look of perfectness and that everybody thinks it's some wonderful place.  The thing that makes AB \\"edgy\\" and \\"hip\\" is the way that the modern American family is revealed to not be perfect.  In fact, it's shown as a mess. <br /> <br />Well, first off if you needed to be told life wasn't perfect you've got bigger problems than liking this steaming pile of crap. <br /> <br />Second, if you think that this film is edgy and subversive and thought that's why it was cool, go watch David Cronenberg's Videodrome.  If you can follow it, you'll get an education in a hurry about what thought-provoking cinema should be. <br /> <br />I'll cut to the chase.  The characters in this film are awful.  Not one of them does a d---ed thing to help themselves.  I, for one, do not identify with characters who wallow in self pity and never stand up to help themselves.  And no, Kevin Spacey's character does not deal with his problems.  He runs from them.  He retreats into a shell of adolescence instead of being an adult and handling the situation he's in.  Frankly, he's the worst of the lot.  We've got a stereotypical (that's right, in a film that's so high-brow we've got a hopelessly stereotyped character) homophobic All-American type war veteran.  He's played capably, but the character is and should be an affront to people's sensibilities.  This is how veterans are portayed in this film?  What the heck kind of message is that?  No veteran I've ever met acted remotely like this. <br /> <br />We've got a cheating housewife, too.  That's great.  You're not adult enough to handle problems in your marriage so you have an affair.  Wonderful.  So far we've got a homophobic, borderline abusive veteran, an irresponsible mother, and we've got the \\"I'll escape my problems by ignoring them\\" Kevin Spacey.  Great. <br /> <br />So we're basically showing how irresponsible Americans are.  This is original?  I can look out my window and see the same point made for free, and it's less snobbishly faux-philosophic. <br /> <br />And if you think it's edgy to look at America as a land of irresponsibility and that this wasn't abundantly obvious already, you've got your head in the ground.   <br /> <br />Instead of dwelling on how bad things are, we should focus on what can be done to fix them.  American Beauty is content to sit and shout \\"LOOK!  LOOK AT HOW AMERICA IS DISINTEGRATING!  LOOK!\\" and makes no effort to rectify the problem.  The ending is two kids doing what everybody else in this waste of time seems to be doing - running away.  Stand up and do something about your lot, you poor excuses for human beings!  But no, they'd rather run away than deal with reality. <br /> <br />And that's what does nothing but infuriate me about this film. <br /> <br />I don't understand how anyone can think this is worthwhile or even vaguely interesting.  I want the two hours I spent watching this back.
0671027387|3.0|This is a decent page-turner, but does have some annoyances that needlessly detract from the story. I'm sure Dan Brown likes to think he does his research, but his lame ignorance of things military is on display here. He opens with a Brownesque assurance that all the technologies mentioned in the book exist, and then proceeds to use military hardware that is non-existent and technically quite infeasible (is Brown a bit credulous?).<br /><br />At one point he calls the movie \\"Top Gun\\" an advertisement for the US Air Force (er, that would be Navy...didn't notice all the water and the aircraft carrier and the \\"US Navy\\" on everyone's flight suits, and ....?).<br /><br />Plot hinges on a civilian functionary not in the chain of command having unquestioned control of a Delta Force hit squad (uh, not going to happen just due to mission-funding paperwork as the most trivial reason), with said Delta Force having no hesitation to kill famous American celebrities who are clearly doing nothing wrong (you avoid this nonsense by just hiring mercenaries, Dan, not hard).<br /><br />And the final love scene, c'mon. It's like his agent told him his book needed a love scene so he tacked on an extra page at the end, sullying the Lincoln Bedroom in the process. Nice to know the heroine of the book is a slut, too, putting out for a guy she's known for a day.<br /><br />All in all, OK if you want to follow Brown's progress as a writer, I suppose.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a big fan of Buffy and Angel, both created by Joss Whedon. I tried not to be a fanboy and buy Firefly right away when I first heard about it on a Buffy fan site. So, cautiously, I watched some episodes from the internet. I shouldn't have worried, the show is excellent. Very well cast, great storytelling, funny and without bumpy head aliens, sound in space, tight uniforms. <br /> <br />To me the best part is the focus on characters and their interplay. I've always loved Robert Altman's work, so imagine my delight when Joss Whedon sais in one episode's commentary: I tried to make this scene like Altman, making it more intimate with staying further back with the camera... by the way, the commentaries on the DVD are well worth listening to. They're funny and you get a great insight into how much care went into creating this amazing show. <br /> <br />And what's this ? Firefly is 10. on the Amazon DVD top sellers list almost 3 years after it was cancelled ? Hmm, I guess I'm not the only one to like this sort of thing :)
B0009HLDFU|3.0|This album's OK. I was psyched to hear the acoustic, given Grohl's frequent translations of his bitchin' hard rock into sublime acoustic. But I gotta say, Grohl is a second rate Ryan Adams, whose Cold Roses blows out Grohl's attempts at the acoustic.  <br /> <br />On the otherhand, I'm diggin' the Disc One. Great hard rock, although it does start to meld together after a few listens. Good to work out to though.
1573223026|5.0|I have never read Mr. Hornby's work before. I found this book delightful, funny, thought provoking, as well as emotional. At times the characters (2) can be annoying, but I believe that was the intention. And it works. I couldn't put it down, I really cared about these 4 people. Pick it up definately, and you might also learn something about yourself.
0893860220|5.0|The beauty of this book in particular is it's length and rare psychological insights that come out..The question and answer format employed by many eastern writers not only gives a sense of community of spirit/leading often to man made idol worship ready made for seekers who for whatever reasons are not comfortable with their born traditions, but also hones in on the value of developing a close relationship with your inner somewhat neglected torn turbulent self.<br /><br />The Godly spirit within and without is often stressed and I often read in these pages on the person's need for realization that they are eternal which certainly helps heals one's rift and conflict in the abyss between heart (inner world with it's womblike tendencies) and the mind (outerworld,image creation, desire).<br /><br />Unlike the born free \\"loner\\" Krishnamurti, whose themes of mystical silence between thought and object in order to hear the revealation of G-D leaves one in a state of inactivity and truly alone(as he was), and indeed while it is a truth that healing society requires the urgency for self change and the awareness of the recognition of one's unique conditioning, STILL in my opinion Krishnamurti's remains somewhat utopian in a highly populated cosmopolitan western competitive black and white world dominated by time and acquisition.<br /><br />Maharaj on the other hand goes a step further and stresses the personal quest for deliverance as a happy fatalism to G-D and/or the inner(out is in,in is out)Self.<br /><br />Self acceptance,stress elimination are indeed worthy goals to be actualized.This book offers reassurance without needing to drive you away from society,leave your wife and kids,drop acid, or move to India, nor to abandon your born religion.<br /><br />Life becomes one loving meditation if one works at it and does not allow himself to bleed slowly away. Eliminating suffering and repairing the world's distractions are still worthy pursuits not to be abandoned because all is eternal beyond words.rds. <br />
B000000H4V|5.0|Before \\"Chaos A.D.,\\" Sepultura were a great death metal band that were as important as Slayer. The only problem was that the genre that Sepultura helped create had become very popular by the early 1990's. Bands like Carcass, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, and Suffocation had formed and Sepultura, even though they made such classics as \\"Arise,\\" sort of started blending into the crowd, because they were only a little bit different from everybody else.<br /><br />Even though I don't think that's what the purpose of  \\"Chaos A.D.\\" was, Sepultura's fifth album definitely helped them stand out. In addition to being very experimental and daring, \\"Chaos A.D.\\" is also one of the band's most creative discs (second only to 1996's \\"Roots\\"). The main difference here has to be \\"Kaiowas.\\" Sepultura had previously flirted with acoustic guitars (like the intro to \\"Beneath the Remains\\"), but \\"Kaiowas\\" was their first completely acoustic song. This instrumental, which is definitely this group's most gentle and pretty song, was also the first heavy metal song (that I know of) to feature tribal drums. This innovation, which later became a trademark of frontman Max Cavalera, would also be adopted by other metal bands, like Ill Nino. Another experiment Max and Co. delved into is having a guest singer. \\"Slave New World\\" features a cameo by Biohazard singer Evan Seinfeld; but his voice is almost indistinguishable from Max's.<br /><br />Some old-school fans think this is where Max sold out and went mainstream. I strongly disagree. Yes, they added some melody, but most of this disc is still caustic heavy metal. Plus, even though the metal is more punk influenced here than it was before (it isn't as fast as the 1980's Sep albums, and there aren't any monstrous vocals on here), I don't see how this C.D. was a complete change of sound. It's not like Sepultura became a nu-metal band. Finally, \\"Chaos A.D.\\" was their breakthrough album, but Sep also enjoyed quite a bit of success with the earlier albums \\"Schizophrenia,\\" \\"Beneath the Remains,\\" and \\"Arise\\" (even if that success was from an underground audience).<br /><br />Something about this album just grabs me and holds on, keeping my attention focused completely on the song I'm listening to. This whole album is artfully catchy and contagious, interesting, memorable, and all around great.<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />\\"Refuse/Resist\\" is a personal favorite because it is so irresistibly catchy and forcefully heavy. It opens with some booming riffs, which is followed by (what sounds like) tin can drums. It then evolves into a stop-start beat, with punching, groove-y guitars. The deep throated vocals then come on, and the song ends with a good guitar solo (which makes a wah-wah sound in places).<br />\\"Territory\\" has a bouncy little drum solo for the intro, then the guitars kick in and make the beat groove. The guitars then alternate from rhythmic riffing to choppy, staccato riffs, and another, louder, guitar solo is included.<br />\\"Amen\\" has chug and churn, up and down riffs. I enjoy the part of this song when the beat comes down a few decibels and some female vocals sing over the light percussion. The song ends with bobbing riffs and some good, pounding drum work.<br />The aforementioned \\"Kaiowas\\" remains a staple/centerpiece of Sepultura's live shows. The band members play for a little while, then abruptly stop to talk amongst themselves. They finally shut up and play the rest of the song in is entirety. They strum the acoustic guitars fast and the drums thump, but, even still, this is a very pretty, melodic, and atmospheric song. I also enjoy the squawking birds, giving it a rainforest vibe.<br />\\"Propaganda\\" has machine gun riffs which, together with the drums, sound awesome. Another Slayer-esque, careening guitar solo is included, and the song ends with cascading riffs.<br />\\"Biotech is Godzilla\\" has a scorching opening riff, but this song is a highlight because of the tempo changes (before and after the choruses, which are slower) and the catchy shout along: \\"BIO-TECH!\\"<br />\\"Nomad\\" has some more stop-start rhythms and riffs, and increasingly fast, heavy, and talented drum work (which becomes especially apparent at the end).<br /><br />\\"Chaos A.D.\\" can easily become very addictive. It is a very interesting, brilliant, and an all around amazing album. With this album, Sepultura showed they were great, creative musicians, in addition to being great metalheads. Thus, I recommend this to both new and old school Max fans. Even though I prefer \\"Beneath the Remains\\" to this, \\"Chaos A.D.\\" is definitely one of the best and most innovative things Max has ever done. The bottom line is, like any Sepultura classic, this is essential listening for all metalheads.ng: \\"BIO-TECH!\\"  \\"Nomad\\" has some more stop-start rhythms and riffs, and increasingly fast, heavy, and talented drum work (which becomes especially apparent at the end).     \\"Chaos A.D.\\" can easily become very addictive.

0967851408|5.0|more excited than that kid I was in that intellectual candy store called the HollyPark library in Hawthorne, CA. ,Though that library is now defunct and closed, this is a book I remember so well at that library that when I heard that Kallisti Publishing had printed a new edition of it, I just had to revisit it. So my head was spinning when I heard it was annonated with a short biography of Charles F. Haanel, I felt young again soon as I heard. I just turned 30, so it took 15 years off my life, to hear that this great book is back on the market, this masterpiece that influenced Napoleon Hill, Frank R. Wallace, Claude M. Bristol and Tony Robbins and flavored their great works with the time tested power of \\"the science of thought\\" and 'yes', \\"mind stuff\\".  Anyhow, the excitment I felt at buying this book was so great that I tracked it all the way from ordering to delivery and if I could give this book six stars, my, MY, I would... I would. So, I suggest you buy a copy while they are around from Kallisti, because the power and majesty of this book even if it was old and dog-eared when I read it was incredible. It was like the ultimate mind-vitamin and when I had my troubles I wondered what happened to it, but the memory was still there of it all though it was a glittering yet thin trail of time that I had left behind of this all-time great book. Like I said in other reviews, I only review 5-starworthy books or better, this is better. If you get this book and GET IT. You'll know what I mean. Thank you for reading this review and I hope you're inspired by it. Because I mean every word of it sincerely.<br /><br />Captain Josh.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This was one of the most anticipated and talked about CDs this year - hands down.  I usually don't buy into hype and have not been a Coldplay fan in the past (I was indifferent to them).  However, I heard the song \\"Fix You\\" and knew that I had to have this CD.  Definitely worth the anticipation and hype.  This CD is so mellow and the music just pulls you in.  I still like the song \\"Fix You\\" the best (really awesome song) but all of them are great, great songs to listen to over and over and over.  This CD is a keeper and will be one of my favorites for years, long after the hype has settled.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|The Foo Fighters have finally hit their mark with \\"In Your Honor.\\"  This is a sensational release by Grohl & Co.  The double album featuring a \\"Rock\\" side as well as a much gentler acoustic set was an ingenious approach by the Foo's.  Standout's on the first disc include \\"Best of You,\\" \\"Resolve,\\" \\"DOA,\\" and \\"No Way Out.\\"  The second acoustic disc showcases Grohl as an extraordinary vocalist.  The guitar duo of Chris Shifflett and Grohl come into their own as guitarists.  Tracks such as \\"Over and Out,\\" \\"Friend of a Friend,\\" and \\"On the Mend,\\" are among the best Foo Fighters songs recorded.  This truly an exceptional album, especially the acoustic disc, and as an avid Foo fan, I encourage everyone to give it a listen.  AMAZING.
B00005JNJT|5.0|This is the \\"Batman\\" film I've long waited to see. While I did like Tim Burton's vision in 1989's \\"Batman\\", I still thought certain elements were missing that I really loved from the \\"Tales of the Dark Night\\" comic book series. By the time Joel Schumacher completely turned the film series into a perverted, campy gay parody, it was obvious that Warner Brothers simply can't be trusted with any superhero franchise (as they also ruined the \\"Superman\\" movies after the second one). If it weren't for the astronomical grosses of \\"Spiderman\\" and its sequel, \\"X-Men\\" and its sequel of the rival Comic Book company and movie studios, I'm certain that \\"Batman\\" would never have been \\"rebooted\\".    My hopes were raised when I heard that Director Chris Nolan and actor Christian Bale were attached to the project. Christian Bale fits my image of Bruce Wayne. Certainly more than Michael Keaton anyway. The trailers then impressed me into seeing this film and when I finally did see it, I was simply awestruck that someone managed to make the perfect Batman film, finally!    This is not a film for the children. One moviegoer walked out with two children in tow an hour into the film. This movie was made for the adult fans of the comic book...not those who love the campy 60s TV show or the Joel Schumacher parodies. For once, I wanted to see a Batman film that focused on Bruce Wayne/Batman and not the villains and this one is it. We don't even see the appearance of Batman until halfway through. For the first hour we get a fuller understanding of Bruce Wayne, his childhood tragedy, how his fear of bats leads to a guilty complex regarding his parents murder, and his soul searching to the mountains of Tibet. This is a very deep, profound, spiritual beginning and provides the most picture of Bruce Wayne yet, helping people understand the kind of person who would spend his nights dressed as a bat going after criminals.    In Tibet, he receives special training from a mysterious Ducard, played by Qui-Gon Jinn himself, Liam Neeson. Wayne learns about the tactics of a vigilante group who operate in the shadows of society. There is a disagreement over the use of violence/vengeance, causing Wayne to part company in cool style and return to Gotham after a 7 year absence. The corruption of the city politicians wakes him up from the naive idealism his parents had instilled in him. Such a privileged life he led, where he thought money could help defeat poverty and crime. He learns otherwise and thus in one uniquely spiritual scene, when Bruce Wayne achieves \\"oneness\\" with a flurry of bats, we see the transformation. Batman is born!    Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow is an excellent villain, using a vaporized drug mist to induce psychotic episodes in people. While this plot might seem a bit of a stretch for a straight foward, dramatic film, it works in \\"Batman Begins\\" because that's what generally happens in comic books. In comparison to the motives of the previous line of whacked out villains of the four \\"Batman\\" films, this one with the Scarecrow is the most realistic and plausible. I saw many allusions to the 2001 Anthrax attacks, so this plot worked. The entire premise of the film is the use of fear to control oneself and others...which is very relevant to today's world.    Nolan's Gotham City looks exactly as I had imagined it from the many \\"Batman\\" comic books I've read as a teenager/young adult. More than Tim Burton's or Joel Schumacher's version, this Gotham looks liveable and realistic (a cross between Chicago and New York City). I also liked that Arkham Asylum was featured, as that hospital for the insane is well featured in the darker Batman comic books. There are underpinnings of psychology and insanity running through the entire comic series, so a Batman film simply isn't the same without Arkham Asylum looming in the background, foreground or anywhere else.    By the film's end, we get a hint of things to come (much like the ending of \\"Spiderman 2\\"), which isn't bad. It might not be a \\"satisfying conclusion\\" for some people, but if this film makes enough money, a sequel is guaranteed. However, even though this is by far the best Batman film ever made, its dark vision and loyalty to the comic book might not go over well with parents who bring their children expecting the bright zaniness/cartoonish quality of the Joel Schumacher films. This film is the complete opposite of Schumacher's two films and that is a good thing. I believe that Schumacher is the person responsible for ruining the franchise and I'm glad Warner Brothers Studios had the good sense to wait 8 years and trust a director with \\"indie cred\\" to give TRUE Batman fans the film we have waited decades to see. This is that film. I even like it better than \\"Spiderman\\" 1 and 2, which is saying A LOT. I hope for the next \\"Batman\\" film, if they feature the Joker, that they base the story on what I consider the greatest Comic Book episode ever created: \\"The Killing Joke\\". That would make an awesome film!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Granted I am a big fan of Batman and have read the graphic novels, but even those who are not familar with the story of Batman will not be disappointed with this MAGNIFICIENT film. There is hardly any flaws and the script is intriguing.<br /><br />Eveybody by now knows the plot. Bruce Wayne is searching for answers concerning redemption and justice and meets an army of ninjas where he recieves training. Then he returns to Gotham City and finds it more corrupt than he left it. He starts to create fear among the criminal world and show them that crime does not pay. Among the chaos, he becomes Batman and must save Gotham from a diabolical villian out to destroy Gotham City.<br /><br />It is a well-told story that involves Bruce Wayne and his transformation into Batman. The film is filled with high caliber actors with Christian Bale as the best Batman ever and forever!! I have seen Christopher Nolan's Memento and loved that entire story as well. He is a superb writer and director who knows how to mess with our minds.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this film except that it deserved to be nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor (anyone of them would be worthy). This film(notice I am stating film instead of a regular movie) be a sweep at the Academy.<br /><br />I have never seen a superhero movie that was perfect all around!! See it NOW!!<br /><br />In addition, I am getting tired of all the negative reviews of this great film. The fact that most of the negative reviews have no supporting reasons why they hate it or they didn't even see it is no excuse to dismiss it online. If you don't like Batman, that's fine, you're entitled to your opinions. But if you don't watch it, you have no reason to hate it.<br /><br />This Batman movie is the best Batman movie (ranks up there with the original Superman) in terms of better writing, actors, effects, and score.<br /><br />If you hate it, give us a good reason why and we'll accept it. Just hating it because of the last two Batman is impulsive. This is not like any of the movies you have seen, so give it a shot. Thank You!!Just hating it because of the last two Batman is impulsive. This is not like any of the movies you have seen, so give it a shot. Thank You!!
B00006ADFL|5.0|Sometimes a director cuts scenes for a reason. Although this DVD is the \\"uncut\\" version, the original theatrical release is highly preferable in that it excludes scenes that really add nothing to the story (watch some well-known films, such as Apocalypse Now, and it's usually the case that the deleted scenes more often than not bog down the narrative). The extra scenes here in this DVD serve only to impede the excellent pacing and relentless build-up to the chilling conclusion. And the final frame of a bloodied Parker detracts from the original cut's ending. The original depiction is quite powerful enough and better conveys her anguish and total despair. This 'uncut' ending only serves to focus attention on the murder itself instead of the overall emotional  consequences of her actions and the pair's final separation.  <br />Be that as it may, Heavenly Creatures is still one of my all-time favorite films. If only they'd offer a DVD with BOTH versions!
B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers has been a long-time favorite of mine.  I usually laugh out loud at the hilarious John Cleese and his absurd antics.  Some can't appreciate British humor (and I don't know why!) but I plead with you to give it a try.  Fawlty Towers is worth your time and $$.  Here's a tip when watching: check out the hotel sign for it's ever-changing name (ex. Watery Towels, Warty Fowls, etc.).  The show is a kick-in-the-pants.  Enjoy!
B000001ESJ|5.0|In the world of classic RUSH, this is paradise (or xanadu if you will).  RUSH's fifth studio release represents another branching-out of the complex progressive sound experimented with heavily on the prior 2 (or even 3) albums.  They slightly tone down the raging intensity of 2112 in favor of more layering and color with 6 very unique and far-out classics.  This is the album that came out when I was just becoming a huge fan and going to the first of 4 concerts.  I had just bought All the World's a Stage a few months before and I knew this band would be huge.  2112 was so great that it seemed tough to beat, but this took RUSH to the next stage (so to speak).  Closer to the Heart shows the budding radio play genius shown in subsequent albums beginning with Permanent Waves...tight and structured shorter songs with focused storytelling (it has always been a huge radio hit).  Cinderella Man shows the reflective and more sensitive (artist's dilemma) theme played out with the usual RUSH intensity - the guitar lead is power-wah heaven, Geddy's Bass carries everything higher melodically (great concert song) - Cinderella man sounds fine to me, manic depressive or not.  PEART, by the way, has moved to higher ground with this album.  Creative approaches and incredible mind-bending technique and power are everywhere (his drumkit is the envy of the western world by this time).  A million young males came out of the drumming closet to emulate Neil Peart, you could see them playing air drums everywhere back then.  The title song is one of my favorites, mixing a bit of a classical medieval feel with sheer rock power on a political labyrinthian fable.  Again, the lyrical and poetic writing take this album to the top of my list, of course the musicianship shown here is RUSH on fire (maybe that's what scorched the Earth on the cover).  Speaking of that, Xanadu is another beautiful epic RUSH classic along the lines of 2112 that has always been one of my favorites.  Mind candy that takes you away to far lands and adventure (from Kubla Khan to ice caves).  Xanadu is one of the most elaborately decorated RUSH songs, which is a good thing.  Part one (or book one - book two is on Hemispheres) of Cygnus X-1 (the space odyssey) clearly places your mind's eye on a ship traveling through a black hole with electric space dust flying everywhere, echoing in the form of power chords and bass thumpings that knock planets off their axis...swirling to another dimension.  Every song is great and let the music world (and other doubters that thought RUSH was a fad) know that you can't keep a few good geniuses down - RUSH MEANS BUSINESS, SO...farewell to kings...a paradigm shift has laid waste to the world order (cover).  Thank you RUSH for rockin' my world all of these years...three people never sounded so good and so powerful...ENJOY!you away to far lands and adventure (from Kubla Khan to ice caves).

0743454537|2.0|This book had an intriguing plot - that a 13-year-old would seek medical empanciation from her family so she could make her own decision about donating an organ to her sister.  It held my interest.  The ending, however, was out of left field and a complete betrayal of everything that had gone before.  Scratch Jodi Picoult off my list of authors!
B0006399FS|5.0|Thanks, Bono, Edge, Larry and Adam for putting out such a great album!  Ok, so it's not the Joshua Tree... how could it be?  that album came out close to 20 years ago and these lads have lived a lot since then.  The rocking City of Blinding Lights is my favorite track followed closely by Yahweh.  Yahweh has a line that breaks my heart everytime I hear it \\"take these lips, so quick to criticize and give them a kiss\\"  I think what makes people uncomfortable with U2 songs and/or albums is that they make you think about important issues and not just your last date.  Keep up the good work guys!  Please bring the tour to New Orleans!
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|Anyone doubting Sharon Stone's acting skills needs to see Martin Scorcese direct her in \\"Casino,\\" his epic about how the Mafia lost control of gaming in Las Vegas. Although she's had duds in her sporadic career, here she is a revelation, exhibiting a wide range of emotion and nuance unseen before or since. Stone is initially exciting and ultimately moving as the wife of casino czar Robert NeNiro. She certainly deserved the Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations she got.    She's never been in headier company. In addition to DeNiro, she holds her own with the brilliant Joe Pesci, James Woods, Kevin Pollak and, in real casting coups, Las Vegas figures Don Rickles, Alan King, Dick Smothers in non-comedic roles and, as themselves, Frankie Avalon, Steve Allen and Jayne Meadows. Stone goes from glamourous hustler, to indulged wife and mother, to pathetic alcoholic and junkie, stealing scenes from the famous names around her. She had it in her or Scorcese drew it out, but who cares? It's stunning work no matter how she achieved it.    Stone isn't the whole show. Scorcese moves the movie along with his trademark tracking shots, multiple narrators, intense violence and attention to detail, almost documentary detail on how casinos stack the cards against the suckers at the tables. Corruption thrives at every level as DeNiro tries to play the game, turn legit, marry and raise a family. But the same cards stacked against the suckers are also stacked against him, and his psycho childhood pal (Pecsi) becomes his adult adversary. Oddly, this true story ends badly for everybody but him.    \\"Casino\\" followed Scorcese's shattering \\"GoodFellas,\\" also with DeNiro and Pecsi in another true crime classic, maybe his best. But \\"Casino\\" has virtures of its own and grabs our lapels throughout. It is engrossing when showing how casinos operate, less so when showing how distrust wrecks a marriage; yet Stone suffuses these scenes with sympathy and pity. Would that other directors would challenge her in mature roles. If I were a gambler, my money would be riding on Sharon Stone.
B0007N1AI6|3.0|like in my painkiller review, this is pretty good but at times goofy, lochness is to long and gets boring, but on the good side 'angel' is the best ballad they written in a long time.
0767834739|4.0|At the end of the first movie we were left with a bit of a cliff hanger.  In this one we see just how the cliff hanger came about and how it is resolved.  Racoon City has been ravaged by the T-Virus and its ability to animate dead tissue.  The city has been walled off from the rest of the world by the Umbrella Corporation. <br /> <br />Umbrella's interest in the city is varied.  Can the city be reclaimed?  Can the virus be contained?  But it also provides a chance for proper field testing of other projects, particularly Project Nemesis.  Through all of this we follow a handful of survivors as they try to stay alive long enough to find a way out of the city.  In the background a third party is pulling stings for his own benefit to locate his daughter who was left behind in the city. <br /> <br />The film is full of action and fighting.  There is less suspense than in the first and most of the monsters and hazards are straight from the first movie.  But it is the characters and what has been done to them, and how they handle it, that provides the real story in this film.  Needless to say there is another cliffhanger/opening at the end to pave the way for a third movie.  Most of the action happens at night so the sets are dark.  The action is fast and between the lighting and the speed, the fight scenes are often uncomprehendable. <br /> <br />If you liked the first movie or the games, you will probably like this one as it is not just a rehashing of previous stories.
B000063DFN|5.0|great album, one of the best maiden albums. if you want great maiden this is where it is, for other great maiden, try 'killers' and 'piece of mind,' the new stuff  'dance of death' and 'brave new world' are not as good, but given a chance they have some fine momements.
B00005JNJT|5.0|When Batman & Robin hit theatres in June of 1997, it single handedly buried the Batman franchise. The characters, writing, directing, acting, and plot were so bad, that fans went into shock. With Batman Begins, director Christopher Nolan has gone back to basics, jettisoning both the silliness of the TV incarnation and the gothic and fetishist elements of the '90s version. This is a hard-core, down-and-gritty origin story - the tale of, as one might reasonably expect, how Batman begins. It isn't intended as a \\"prequel\\" to the 1989 film, not only is Gotham City a completely different place, but key events of the Batman chronology are re-spun. Batman Begins is designed as the start of a new life, a reboot for the franchise. In the process, Nolan has not only crafted the best Batman movie, but arguably the second-best motion picture superhero narrative. Through every inch this film shows how Batman got his cool gadgets and his fighting style. Can't wait till this goes on DVD.
B0000630BT|3.0|the painkiller is a ok album, my problem with it is it's to cheesy and goofy in spots, but overall it's still pretty good.
0399241515|2.0|I had a good mindset goin into this book because all of the other books in the Alex Rider series were pretty good and his new book Raven's Gate was pretty good to. But I was suprised when I read the book at how much different it was. It wasn't good at all it was just OK. Then the ending came and it was extremely bad. I would not reccomend this book to anyone!
B0009NSE1K|5.0|i'm still learnig about this disc, but it's pretty obvious that clutch continues to improve as songwriters, i'm not sure where this album rates with the other clutch CDS yet. the last reviewer is a pretty typical rocker, the mention of keyboards as a negative thing, and somehow being angry at the world is somehow cool. clutch are passed that angry stage, (thank god) it would be real silly for these mid thirty guys to be trying to act like they are teenagers. keep rockin clutch.
B0006L16N8|4.0|The impression I get is that the two previous albums were nothing but a preparation for this one, which is undoubtedly their best work so far. From the catchy 'Talk' (ok, they got the main riff from Kraftwerk's Computer Love, but that doesn't make the song any worse, does it?) to the beautiful folk-rock ballad 'Til Kingdom Come'. Just hear carefully how the drums and dynamics of the songs have evolved. Listen to 'Clocks' and then to 'Speed Of Sound' for comparison matters. The only reason I won't give 5 stars to this album is because I really think lyrics should be more than just simple rhyme.
0790729369|4.0|This film was surprisingly good, reminded me of what a true virtuoso Meryl Streep really is...she really takes over every scene. Clint Eastwood is a competent actor but he can't hold a candle to her, she really is just magnificent.<br /><br />As I understand it, the bestseller it's based on is awful though, so this is one of those rare cases when the movie far surpasses the book instead of the other way around.<br /><br />What to say about it?  Plot-wise, it's one of those \\"ships passing in the night, a night that changed their lives forever\\" things except that instead of one night we have a 4-day affair, and one in which the outcome is a bit more convoluted than usual---lest I spill the beans for those who have not seen it, let's just say that there's a fair bit of \\"responsibility\\" and \\"self-transcendence\\" involved.<br /><br />It has a bit of the languid, leisurely pacing that Eastwood-directed films tend to have and a few clumsy moments with the minor characters but the scenes of Eastwood and Streep togther never failed to hold my attention, both beautifully shot and superbly acted especially by Streep.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Great Music! I love Coldplay since I listened to \\"Yellow\\", I have been a biggest fan of the band.  Their songs are great. I like every songs in X and Y.  It is my favourite album of the year. There are variety of sounds which combined togetther very well. Chris MArtin's voice blows my mind, esp. in \\"swallowed  in the sea\\". My favourite songs are A message, What if, Fix you, The hardest part and Kingdom come.  Their songs are definitely worth to listen again and again. I listen to them everyday. It is amazing to have this band around so we can get to listen to masterpiece of them.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|This is a well made film based upon an incredibly great story.  However Brad Pitt does not have the necessary talent to pull off the difficult role of Achilles.  Pitt does an OK job, but to really make this film fly, you need a really top-flight acting talent like Mel Gibson, Sean Penn, Sean Connery when he was young, you get the idea.  Instead, pretty-boy Brad Pitt seems kind of wooden in the role.  However, it was still entertaining and worthy of 3 stars.
B000002HMH|5.0|I love heavy music, especially Metallica. They are my all time favorite band, and I have seen them change throughout the years. Load is a change, but in a great way. Metallica is heavy, but the CD proves they are versatile. They can change their sounds and still sound great. Songs like \\"2x4\\", \\"King Nothing\\", \\"Until it Sleeps\\", \\"Bleeding Me\\", \\"Wasted my Hate\\", \\"Momma Said\\", and \\"Ronnie\\" are all great songs. Kirk's guitar, and Jason's bass shine in this album. I've seen Metallica live twice in the past 5 years, and trust me these can still kick ass with their old music and the stuff that's new (St. Anger is an exception, it was not a good album).
B0001I561E|5.0|This movie is one od disney's best animated films, is a wonderful with the best songs, and a cute story. And in this special edition you can sing along, see music videos, play games and the best, for me, is that u can see it in english spanish and french. Awesome! its a classic
B00005JNJT|5.0|This is not just the best Batman movie, but one of the best movies I have ever seen period. In a word...EXCELLENT! Just go see it. George Lucas could learn something about story telling and choosing excellent writers, actors, and directors. <br /> <br />The characters are well developed and well acted. You actually care about them. The story and atmosphere are real. You get sucked in from the beginning and stay until the very last frame. Christian Bale IS Batman and Michale Cane does a great job as Alfred. The biggest surprise is Gary Oldman as a good guy. He should do it more often. Can't wait for the next installment!!
B0007KTBIU|5.0|This is an aswesome movie, one of disney's classic best hits. IN this new version you can play games, sing along, see music videos, and the best of all for me, you can see it in english, spanish and french!. it;s a must see. its a story that teach stuff and a beautiful love story.. and sad haha. so buy it!
B00003CX5P|4.0|Qui-Gon Jinn, a master Jedi, is sent by the republic to solve a commercial dispute between the Federation and the pacific planet of Naboo. With him is his young apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi<br /><br />The dispute is just an excuse to invade the planet. Evil forces are aligning to manipulate Queen Amidala's power. While Qui-Gon and Kenobi try to save the queen, they hide in the desert planet of Tatooine, where they meet a slave boy, Anakin Skywalker, who helps them when trouble shows up.<br /><br />Jinn recognizes in Skywalker unique talents and suspects he may be the \\"Chosen One\\". Prophecies pointed out that a great Jedi Knight would emerge and bring balance and equilibrium to the Universe.<br /><br />The Phantom Menace takes us to the past, something unusual as we already know the end of the story. Shadows from Episodes 4, 5 and 6 are clearly present in this film, not only because this movies conform a legacy that still today are very powerful, but because his creator, George Lucas, has elaborated a script that takes elements from all the previous episodes.<br /><br />Known faces, like R2-D2, C-3PO, Jabba and the beloved Yoda come to the screen in brief cameos. Also, Lucas steals Hollywood icons to feed his adventure: the Tatooine race is homage to the Ben Hur race. Also, his mythological, religious and political interests are present in E1.<br /><br />This is a movie clearly made for kids, which comes as a disappointment for all the fans of the original trilogy. The acting is not very good, and the dialog is stiff, clumsy and boring. The Jar Jar character is just plain annoying. It doesn't have that old charm of the early movies. It's saturated of effects. Still, the movie is visually astonishing. TPM is a fantasy adventure that satisfied the expectations of many. But that very same expectation became his greatest weakness, as later was hardly criticized by critics and hard core fans. It should have been much better, and sadly, we just got this video game.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I remember, when I was young, idolizing the vampire hunter Van Helsing the vampire hunter.  I would get together with one of my friends and together we would try to slay my sister or the school bully.  Then I heard a movie about Van Helsing was coming out and I was very excited.  Then the movie came out and I was very, very, VERY upset.  Van Helsing is one of those movies that does everything wrong and doesn't try hard not to.  There is so much wrong with Van Helsing I didn't know where to start.  But I think I'll start with Van Helsing himself. <br />Van Helsing is essecentially a frankenstein made out of the parts of better heroes.  He is dressed like Indian Jones's evil brother trying so desperately to be as cool.  He has gadgets like James Bond that really shouldn't exsist in that period and still don't exsist today.  Like the rapid fire crossbow.  And he has the personality of Wolverine gone so far as to have amnesia. <br />Sadly, he isn't well acted either.  In fact, none of the people act well in this entire picture.  This is especially noticeable with Dracula himself who has the fakest accent possible.  What truly amazes me is that these actors normally do a good job.  Apparently the director was content with them giving their lowest performances. <br />It is apparent that most of the money went to the special effects, which are just as dissapointing.  The monsters seem to have been designed by a five-year-old on crack.  And they aren't all that well rendered either.  Most of the monsters resemble moving glob of jello. <br />Then you have a story.  Van Helsing is an amnesiac who works for a secret service hunting down monsters.  Th monsters seem to all have once been human.  As a result, Van Helsing is seen as a murder, and isn't liked or wanted.  And Van Helsing doesn't seem to like his job either.  So you wonder why he bothers doing it at all.  Anyway, Van Helsing is sent to kill Dracula who seems to know him.  Van Helsing than meets some princess played by Kate Beckinsale.  She can't go to heaven until, Dracula is dead.  This is hard as Dracula can't be killed by the same ways a vampire or human.  You stake him, garlic him or even burn him he won't die.  So how is he a vampire exactly?  And while were at it, why is there a full moon every night?  Why does frankenstein have giant orbs on his body?  And why, for the love of god, did Van Helsing bring a pathetic monk with him? <br />This movie has nothing entertaining about it.  The only person who is dumb enough to watch it is probably Hugh Jackman.  Hopefully, a good Van Helsing movie will come out.  Until then, quench your vampire action craving with Underworld

I've listened to Greenday since I was 5 years old and now I'm 14.  they my favorite Band. they are inside my locker and inside my notebooks and my computer too.

0553802534|2.0|I like Lisa Gardner but this book was a total waste of my time.         Bobby was an idiot who thought with what was between his legs, not between his ears.  He did such inane, self-destructive things even though he knew Catherine was taking him for a ride.  Catherine was totally unlikable.  She was a manipulative, cold hearted user.  But Bobby still followed her around like a lost puppy.  She seemed a whole lot more worried about protecting her lifestyle than she did protecting her son.         Glad I didn't pay full price for this one!
B0008GNJZY|5.0|One of the best messages this movie brings to light, is that the first step in overcoming an obstacle is to stop denying it exist.  Coach Carter's players were headed down the a path that they refused to see.  I believe it is always easier to see where people are headed when looking from afar - much like watching a movie.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson is extremely convincing in his role as the coach who benched his team unitl they began to take their education seriously.  I always rate movies based on how well they draw me into the film.  I only give out a five-star rating when the movie is so good that I forget I am watching a movie.  Jackson's acting caused that to happen a few times.  The man is a genius on screen.<br /><br />There are a lot of great actors in this film.  Rob Brown, Robert Ri'chard, Rick Gonzalez, Nana Gbewonyo, Antwon Tanner, Channing Tatum, and Texas Battle are great in this film!  Ashanti came up a little flat in this one.  She needed more raw emotion in her character.  She actually underacted.  I guess that's better than overacting her part as Kyra.<br /><br />This movie has plenty of great moments, but at times it did seem to be a little long.  I think it could have been twenty minutes shorter and still brought home its message.<br /><br />But once again, Samuel L. Jackson is a genius on the big screen.  I just learned that he has four more movies coming out very soon.  I can't wait!<br /><br />This movie is worth buying the DVD, which is exactly what I plan on doing.
B00006879E|5.0|I love this CD. <br />My favourite songs are \\"sunday morning\\", \\"must get out\\" and \\"she will be loved\\". <br /> <br />They sound a little bit exotic, it's so refreshing.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is my second review for this film, the first I gave it 5 stars. But I had to remove that to get this second post.  <br /> <br />Why - because I couldnt leave the offensive, rude and stupid remarks of some of the people who didnt like it. Why does it need that rudeness. Ok so let me reply for the people who thought this movie was good, well acted and means something. <br /> <br />A cursory look amongst one or two of the people who lately branded us \\"retarded\\" and are \\"clearly are lacking any substantial intellectual horsepower\\" tell me all I need to know. These intellectuals gave Reservoir Dogs and Platoon zero star reviews whereas one actually gave the Hillary Duff album a fantastic review. <br /> <br />So I respectfully say that if these are your yardsticks of quality I would recommend you stick to JLo films and dull vacuous books about locomotives. Leave the energetic well executed films for us boys and girls who have some life in our lives. Can you do that?
6305428042|5.0|I got to thinking what movies about witches are the best. I could only think of a handful like \\"The Witches of Eastwick\\", \\"The Craft\\", \\"The Witches\\", and \\"Hocus Pocus\\"; two very dark, adult films and two more family oriented films. How I came to those decisions was me thinking about how witches were portrayed; you know, the classic characteristics that you got about the as you grew up like: 1. Flight. Yes, all films show flight but it's only 'Hocus Pocus' that shows flight on broomticks; the classic way. 2. Spells/Magic. All four had them but which one had lightning and electricity coming out of thier fingertips? - 'Hocus Pocus'! 3. The wardrobe. 'Hocus Pocus' was the only one that seemed to be going for the most authentic look for a witch. Therefore, I think 'Hocus Pocus' is without a doubt the best film about witches since 1993.    I know this sounds crazy. I'm the kind of person who wouldn't be caught dead telling someone that I abosolutely loved this movie. My kinds of films are far more adult (i.e. P.T. Anderson's Magnolia, The Hours, Pulp Fiction, Lost in Translation). So to go from that to this is a big step for me! OK. In all seriousness, I can't stress how much FUN this film is! I thouroughly enjoyed it so much and I'm over the age of 20! I know it's target audience is fairly young but I probably wouldn't want my little ones under the age of 10 to watch it. Yes, it's Disney but this movie has some pretty daring content for the regular family Disney fare we all know. There's a handful of curse words, though small ones but still enough to not want your small children repeating them. Heads are beheaded (with no blood), dead people come up from the grave, and a black cat gets run over flat. Mind you, this is all centered around three witches who are reserected by a virgin (if don't think your kids are ready to know what a virgin is, then you might want to skip this. The word is thrown around a couple of times, as a joke of course). Their mission: to suck the souls out of all the children in Salem! Pretty risky stuff, huh?- for Dinsey!    I am so surprised that this was such a bomb in theaters. It truely is an underrated effort. The production value is top notch. The special effects are really good and hold up really well even in our \\"matrix-esque\\" era. The preformances are great. You have to think, these are 17th century witches we're discussing. They have to be somewhat enjoyable to watch. Luckily, they are. Bette is perfect as the head honcho. Kathy Naijimy and the wonderful Sarah Jessica Parker are equally fabulous. If you watch and love \\"Sex and the City\\", then you'll get a kick out of watching Miss Bradshaw bumble around. Overall, I was totally bewitched!
B000002UJQ|5.0|It is hard to believe that this album came out around eight years ago. Bands today, Coldplay, Keane, Kaiser Chiefs, all these popular bands to hit it big owe their thanks to none other than Radiohead. OK Computer starts off with a very good beginner in Airbag, a very deep song that takes many listens to, to fully appreciate it. Actually, the entire album is very much the same. I was not a huge fan until i came back several weeks later and listened again. Paranoid Android is a 6 minute epic song that is really wonderful and you feel several different emotions at once. Other standouts on this record include Let Down, of course  Karma Police, Climbing up the Walls, Lucky, and No Surprises. Thats almost the entire album. To be honest this album does not get enough credit and in my opnion SHOULD NOT IN ANYWAY BE COMPARED TO PINK FLOYD. Pink Floyd has nothing on Radiohead. Seriously buy this album. It might just change your taste in music.
B0002UOK04|4.0|I bought this album solely on the fact that they were Finnish and followed the formula of guitar, bass, drums, and keyboard. Along with bands like Norther, Kalmah, Imperanon, and Children of Bodom, the formula has yet to let me down. If this is what mainstream music sounds like in Finland, the mainstream folks over there should consider themselves blessed. Unlike American mainstream music, these guys are truly talented on their instruments, as well as excellent songwriters. I honestly don't know much about these guys other than what I have heard from the album, but I will say that if these guys are just following a fad in Finland, then I pray it continues. LONG LIVE FINNISH METAL!!!
B0009IW88A|4.0|The film is without a doubt, the best Batman movie since 1989's Batman. I was more than pleased.<br /><br />  Now, about the music, Way back when I heard about the project, I had also heard that Christopher Nolan had wanted to use Elfman's theme. That must have been only a rumor, because it isn't there. I was intrigued by his choice of Composers though. James Newton Howard is one of my favorites( Unbreakable and Village in particular), and I remember listening to Zimmer's 'the Rock' and wondering what he would have done with Batman.<br /><br />  Now, right off the bat, sorry about the pun, I will say that Elfman's original score is still the quintessential Batman score, but Howard and Zimmer have done a very decent Job.<br />Gone is the dark playfulness of Elfman and the Campy weirdness of Goldenthal(thank goodness), instead we have a very brooding and urban take on the Hero.<br /><br />  The most notable theme is the Parent theme or longing theme or sad theme or whatever you want to call it. It is most notably heard in track 7 and track 11, probably elsewhere but I can't remember where. This is distinctly Howard's work and some of his best. The \\"Batman\\" theme is harder to find, because there are two possibilities. One is a rising chord that is repeated quite a few times throughout the score. The other is a driving rhythym that is most prominent in track 10. But let's not forget the \\"Bat\\" motif that opens the cd. It is less music and more of a slowed down wing flapping sound and is quite effective. My Dad will Hate it.<br /><br />  Big complaint. Lack of melodic villain themes.  The Ras' al Ghul theme is very hard to find(beginning of track 12). The Scarecrow doesn't get a theme per se, but rather a piece that I like to call the Fear Enhancer which you will find in track 6 without any problem.<br /><br />  The track titles themselves are named after different types of bats and that makes it  difficult to figure out where they go in the movie, so after seeing the film three times, I came up with my own titles:<br /><br /> 1. Logo/the Well<br /> 2. My Father's House<br /> 3. Flaming Monastary<br /> 4. Parent's Death<br /> 5. The Dock Fight<br /> 6. Night of the Scarecrow<br /> 7. Monorail<br /> 8. Panic in the Streets<br /> 9. Nocturnal Activities<br />10. The Tumbler<br />11. Rebuilding<br />12. Ducard's Lesson<br /><br />  All in all, I rank this right under Shirley Walker's Mask of the Phantasm score(which is tied with Batman Returns) and right above Elliot Goldenthal's Batman Forever(and Robin). I can only hope these two guys are on hand for Nolan's next outing, and hopefully they will have a Joker theme raring to go.th my own titles:     1. Logo/the Well    2. My Father's House    3.

B000096IBI|5.0|Chaplins Modern Times is stupendous social satire of the living and working conditions during the depression. Godard is brilliant in the role as the woman living by her wits and she sure is very attractive and quite beautifull and one does not have to think twice why Chaplin picked her to star in this movie. Chaplin is an amazing actor and he plays the role with dedication, fortitude and he must be ranked as one of the best actors of the begining of the 20th century. The scene with the rollarskates and him singing in gibberish are classic scenes and show his brilliance in the last silent movie made in Hollywood. This is a movie that was considered one of the top 100 comedies of all time and I totally agree.
B00005JNJT|5.0|This film is a completely different take on Batman. As a kid, Batman was my favorite hero in the comics and ever since, all things Batman were cool. <br />I was surprised by the approach the director took on Batman Begins, and I'm sure it was a very difficult execution, but superb craftsmanship and originality bring this Batman very lively unto the screen, although he's humanized and the origins of his \\"powers\\" are explained. <br />It didn't hurt to see familiar movie legend faces such as Liam Neeson, Michael Caine (he's everywhere these days, but that's fine), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer (from e.g. Bladerunner ... and in a sense this motion picture reminded me a little bit of Balderunner in some scenes). The twist of the story is very interesting and my 11+ year old said that it was a cool movie and he found it a little scary at times. There's plenty of action and it's the least cheesy Batman film ever made so far. <br />In this film you learn about the humanity of Batman, although we all know it's a fictional character, but it's interesting to say the least. Bottom line, it's well worth watching Batman Begins and this flick has an edge to it and it is more serious and darker than the previous takes on this comic book hero.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Ok, who is this Bonnie chick? She obviously cannot judge talent because lets see her try to play with as much compassion and dedication as Stevie did. The man is one of the GREATEST guitarists to ever pick up a Strat. All of those people she mentioned I have never even heard of and probably wouldn't care listening to them anyways. Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimi Hendrix, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Yngwie Malmsteen, Michael Angelo, all of those guys are good guitar players.
B000002IZ4|5.0|It's no secret to anyone that knows me that Stone Temple Pilots is one of my favorite bands of all time, but I am also very honest about the albums they put out and after 'Purple' things started to go downhill thanks to the continued drugs problems of Scott Weiland.  After the amazing debut album 'CORE' (one of, if not my favorite album of all time), STP was able to record Purple in only a matter of weeks.  It's quite clear that STP were at their creative best at this time in their careers and it shows in their music here.<br /><br />Quick Track By Track Review:<br /><br />01. Meatplow - Great riff, good lyrics, solid song ****<br /><br />02. Vasoline - One of the best of the ablum *****<br /><br />03. Lounge Fly - Some of the best music on the entire album, great effort here ****<br /><br />04. Interstate Love Song - One of STP's most beloved songs ever ****<br /><br />05. Still Remains - Horribly undervalued song, truely beautiful and deserves more recognition *****<br /><br />06. Pretty Penny - Fair song, my 2nd least favorite on the album ***<br /><br />07. Silvergun Superman - Weiland's words just are riveting, great effort ****<br /><br />08. Below Empty - One of STP's top 10 songs of all time *****<br /><br />09. Unglued - Tons of energy in this song, awesome work here ****<br /><br />10. Army Ants - Worst song on the album and the only track that I don't like, a sign of the STP to come **<br /><br />11. Kitchenware & Candybars - Beautiful track made better when you MP3 it and cut out the hidden track down to 4 minutes of pure musical bliss ****<br /><br />Folks, you can't go wrong with this album.  If you want to hear what music was like in the early 90s and see how good STP was at the time, do yourself a favor and pick this wonder up.<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005JNJV|5.0|At first I was not very appreciative of the trailers. I was uncertain that this movie was any good. I heard from others that it was, so I saw it once and became hooked. I have seen this film three times already. Twice at a theatre down the road, and once at the Boeing Imax theatre in Seattle. I have to say that I believe this film is far superior to the previous films including the Tim Burton films.  <br /> <br />With the introduction of CGI vs. the scale models for Burton Batman, the bar is raised considerably higher. The production design was breathtaking. I loved how Gotham is a huge metropolis( kind of a mix between New York and Chicago. Daylight does exsist in Gotham and it is not always raining.  <br /> <br />The sound design was suberb yet a little loud. I loved the music. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard did a fantastic job potraying the emotion of the film. Take for example, Batman encounters the Scarecrow in one scene and one would think he has the upper hand. And when Batman fails, you really do feel for him and the man under the mask.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed the fact that the filmmakers decided to make everything in Batman's arsenal plausibe, and everything serves a purpose. Some of the characters/actors that never signed on board for another film have been given an excellent way out. I suspect we will definetely see Michael Caine and Gary Oldman again.  <br /> <br />The actors all hit their marks right on the money. I don't know what the big deal with Katie Holmes is, but eh, whatever floats your boat. I look forward to buying the DVD on the one of the best websites around. <br /> <br />Of course it is Amazon.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|These guys have no two albums alike. The newest is no different. They've expanded their ranks to include an organ player, and written an album that is both heavier and stranger than Blast Tyrant, while also being more blues-influenced. I think these guys have been listening to their latest live album and learning from the sound on there, as this album has less guitar overdubs and layered vocals than previous records. They really break new ground on here with several songs, as well as rocking out as well as they have been since 1991. A perfect recording.
B000000HHE|5.0|This is another tape I wore out back in the day. Why can't they make rap this good these days?
B000002J09|5.0|Why is it that when a band doesn't sing about love, money, or hoes (like this pop/rock, emo, numetal, rap crap epidemic we're all going through), people say its evil? Led Zeppelin is the farthest thing from \\"satanic\\". During any concerts, did they channel people from the dead to talk to them, or curse anybody that hated them, or did they kill your baby as an offering to satan, or predict your future because they are pshycics, or did they yell \\"Satan, worship him, 666 all the way? No. Geez, all you s**thead one star reviewers (though there are not many of them, suprise, suprise) has a huge misconception of the word \\"satanism\\". Just because a band may talk about depression, or other matters and just happens to be rock, it is not automatically satanic. Get it through your thick heads. \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is overplayed, but how is it satanic? Is the name of the song \\"Stairway to Hell\\"? No, its \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", and its a great song. You want a satanic band. Try Slipknot (which is weird, because one of the most hyprocritical things I have ever read was from a one star review on this album. He said that Led Zeppelin is satanic, and then suggested you listen to Slipknot instead. SLIPKNOT, the same band that has a song titled, \\"666\\". Wow.). <br /> <br />Just thought I should clear that up. I will be adding more to this review when I actually own the album (only 3 songs, which I downloaded.)and listen to it thoroughly. (wierd, I have hundreds of CD's in my collection, and oddly enough, I don't own this.) I just can't stand to see such a huge mistake being made by a bunch of dumba**es who aren't smart enough to wise up and look in a dictionary for the word, \\"satanism\\".
B0009HLDFU|4.0|A prolonged release from The Foo Fighters with In Your Honor, as Dave Grohl claimed he was very disappointed with the One By One album. It is obvious from the opening side, that the band is staying very close to their rock roots, not especially experimenting with anything different compared to previous releases. However, the acoustic side is Dave Grohl showing off his musical brilliance, displaying to the public that he is capable of producing some dark, deep and at times even emotional tunes.<br /><br />A very hard-rocking disc, the opening self-titled track begins with very loud, heavy guitar riffs and a shouting Grohl. A fairly strong rocker with powerful drums, however No Way Back seems to carry more memorable guitar hooks, with a better lyrical delivery, a very familiar style of rock for the Foo Fighters. Best Of You is a great choice for a single, and an immediate standout track with very smooth dynamics in the guitars. DOA and Hell lack memorable guitar hooks, nevertheless find their place on the first side nicely. The Last Song is another catchy song, that clicks in very quickly, with the effective repeating chorus, and strong backing riffs. Free Me is in ways similar to Monkey Wrench with a powerful lyrical delivery from Grohl, and a sensational opening electric strum, leading into a fiery rocker. Resolve is a lighter rocker, with a very smooth melody, maybe the best song musically off the album, with a very great feel to it. The last two tracks end the album very well, with memorable guitar hooks coming from both tracks, and End Over End ending the first disc powerfully and convincingly. It almost seems like a statement from the Foo Fighters, telling fans they haven't lost their ability to create some quality rock.<br /><br />Disc 2, a much darker, expressive disc, displaying sensational innovation from Dave Grohl, with compelling acoustic hooks, and soft lyrical deliveries. Opening with an almost disturbing, gripping melody that reaches out to the listener in many ways from the track Still. What If I Do? has a much more comfortable strum in terms of the emotions it intends to give off, with another beautiful guitar strum and a memorable chorus. Miracle features a beautiful chorus, with John Paul Jones offering some essential piano accompaniement. Another Round seems very familiar each time I hear it to something the group once did, of course not acoustic though. A great song with mandolin from Jones.  Friend Of A Friend is the darkest, most compelling song on the track listing, a moving song which has to be my favourite amongst this 2 disc release. The guitar strum shows Grohl's ability to pioneer a completely new sound through an entire album. Lyrically, an entrancing delivery from Grohl.  On The Mend has a very memorable tune, and is certainly a highlight, with a very glowing lyrical delivery from Grohl. Cold Day In The Sun features drummer Taylor Hawkins providing some vocals, on a strong light folk/rock track. Razor closes the album on a high point, with a rising guitar strum used effectively.<br /><br />Overall, a great release from the Foo Fighters, and arguably the best release of the year showing a great deal of creativity from the band, especially Grohl. One aspect not acknowledged by very many people is the great drums throughout this release. A must buy for all Foo Fighters fans, and a very consistent album with both sides keeping close to their intended sound. Highly recommended.from the track Still.

B00005JN2Z|5.0|Collateral is one of the best movies of 2004.  Starring Jamie Foxx as Max, a taxi driver who happens to be the victim of bad luck when he picks up a hitman, Tom Cruise (Vincent). What ensues is one of the most dark, yet entertaining movies I've seen. The movie grows in suspense with every ticking moment until the last 25 minutes when everything explodes. Great performance by Jamie Foxx, who later on that year showed even more genius by his performance of The Genius Ray Charles.   <br /> <br />There is only one complaint though, and it doesn't have anything to do with the actual movie.  It's the fact that Tom Cruise was once again snubbed by the Academy Awards.  If you ask me, that sucks (for a lack of a better word). He gave, in my opinion, one of his best performances.  That's two movies back to back (The Last Samurai being the other) where he deserved to be nominated but was turned down. I'm not a big Cruise fan myself, but I know a great performance when I see it. <br /> <br />But for the sakes of buying, I definitely give Collateral 5 stars and a high recommendation. By the way, it also makes me think twice about ever going into a taxi.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I was a little disappointed by this album.  All the hype surrounding its release literally forced me into buying it and the little snippets I heard on itunes sounded enticing.   <br />I found the melodies and arrangements a little formulaic and repetitive.  I think their sound is becoming a little too predictable and not very exciting. <br />This is mainstream, uninspiring  pop music, disguised and packaged as cool music by a leading rock band. <br />I think recent works by bands like Wilco and  Radiohead and artists like Rufus Wainwright are far superior!
B0002OERI0|4.0|I anxiously bought this record the week of its release with some high hopes.  I was in kindergarten when Green Day's breakthrough record \\"Dookie\\" was popular, but I remember my sister owning it, and since then I've been a fan. After buying their most recent release \\"American Idiot\\", I went home and listened to it cover to cover. What I found was nothing what I suspected and I quickly embraced it as one of my favorites. I then went here to amazon.com to see how others liked the CD. I was surprised that there where reviewers who where completely missing the point.  These were followed by reviews of very ignorant people bashing Green Day, the band, not their music. So what I'll try to do (I emphasize TRY because a lot of people with thick skulls have computers) is address these issues.<br /><br />-Many people have called Green Day \\"poseurs\\" because they sold out, and are not punk any more. To tell you the truth, their music was never punk to me. Billie Joe, Mike and Tre could be punks themselves but their music dose not sound too similar to punk music of the 70s and 80s.<br /><br />-Secondly many, many people are bashing Green Day because of the album's political message. The blame of this can be put on total ignorance. Case in point; do you think the band would be writing music that reflects today's society if they didn't care about the country and the people who live in it?<br /><br />-Another complaint is that the band has changed their sound. Another case in point is Guns N' Roses \\"Use Your Illusion\\" records. The band did something different, something out of the norm, and created two records that some fans (yours truly included) regard as their best. When some people become too attached to a certain sound, change is not welcome. I could never see these people living in the 60s and 70s when bands like Pink Floyd were around and experimented with their sound.<br /><br />In conclusion, I wrote this review not for the people who have reviewed the music necessarily, but for those whose judgment has been clouded by wrong interpretations, or those who have yet to understand the title's meaning.sarily, but for those whose judgment has been clouded by wrong interpretations, or those who have yet to understand the title's meaning. <br />
0060977493|2.0|I'm beginning to the think the Booker Prize is the best reason NOT to buy a book. The God of Small Things didn't do it for me at all. I found it dull and affected. As another reviewer remarked, the similes are endless and, although they might sound good, for the most part are simply off target. Overrated tedium is perhaps the best way to sum up this book.
067144901X|5.0|All the good things you've heard about this book are true.  My fifteen-month-old daughter loves books and has about 25, and while she's normally content to just sit and leaf through the pages, once or twice a day she'll bring a book to me and put it in my hand, obviously asking me to read it to her.  Moo Baa La La La is ALWAYS the first book she picks up.  She just loves it and wants me to read it to her two or three times in a row (good thing it's a short book!)  This book obviously has universal appeal that all kids love.
0780622650|3.0|Virtually unrelated to the TV show (so not much of a nostalgia trip), but a decent SF movie on its own.  By definition, any movie containing Gary Oldman (the most versatile actor in history) has a lot going for it, but if you have the grown-up-Will-Robinson thing going, why not use Billy Mumy???  He obviously is a talented actor (cf. Babylon 5).  Worth watching, and the disc (at a discount) has a fair number of extras. <br />
B0007XT7V8|5.0|This album is crazy. Theory proves that they are an up and coming super band with this sophomore release. I listened to each and every song on this album app. 160 times before I could put the CD down. From \\"Hating Hollywood\\" to \\"In the Middle\\" this CD is a Must Have for Rockers, let alone Theory fans. \\"Santa Monica\\" is the darkhorse and \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" is bittersweet. If you need to save up, do it, and get this Disc.
B0006L16N8|2.0|This album isn't terrible; it's just entirely devoid of GREAT songs. Both Parachutes and Rush of Blood had songs that demanded immediate repeat listens. Not so with X&Y. This album just meanders. The catchy piano hooks that Martin is known for are missing. Very, very disappointed. I think a lot of people really want to like this album, so they're giving it lots of stars. Read the Rolling Stone review for a second opinion. It's dead on.
B0007P3582|1.0|disregard the 1 star rating because this thing is in the negative, i'm really disgusted with the state of hip hop and hope that good rappers will get to shine in the spotlight one day and not talentless bums like this, i agree with matt c check out the new Common cd, and Sean Price, Madlib, C Ray Walz and Perceptionists cds, if you made the mistake of buying this cd put it to good use as a coaster
B0000DJZA5|2.0|A lot of the reviews here are right on the mark.  My 2 cents- What a BLOWN opportunity.  We all know the story, The \\"Let it be sessions\\" started as the \\"Get back Sessions\\"- a double meaning in that one of the original ideas was to \\"Get Back\\" to the old style of Beatles records of just 4 guys with minimal overdubs and edits.  When it was finished, all decided to shelve it.  A year later, Phil Spector \\"cleans it up\\" a bit with edits and overdubs.  The resulting album disappointed many, including Paul.  So \\"let's fix it\\".  Let's put the album out that should have been.  Is that what this is?  NOOOO!  Where did it go wrong?  Oh where do I begin? <br /> <br />The title- How upsurd- Naked what?  Call the thing Get Back like it was supposed to be.  The album cover- WORSE than the \\"old\\" Let it Be (which was lousy also); should have been the Get Back cover- the one on the \\"Blue Album 67-70\\" (and why not? The \\"Red Album 64-66\\" duplicated the cover of Please Please me album).  The Song order- Random.  Song order should be: <br />1. Get Back <br />2. Don't let me down <br />3. One after 909 <br />4. Dig a Pony <br />5. I've Got a Feeling <br />6. I me Mine <br />7. Two of Us <br />8. Across the Universe <br />9. Long & Winding Road <br />10. For You Blue <br />11. Let it Be <br /> <br />The versions- edits on Get Back (horrible), I Me Mine, Dig a Pony, to name a few.  Lamer rehearsal versions of other songs:  Don't let me Down, Long & Winding Road (a better version and still stripped of orchestra is on Anthology 3).  And then a couple songs virtually the same as on \\"Let it Be\\". <br /> <br />Last, the \\"Bonus disc\\"- what a nice coaster it makes.  What a mess- 30 second snippets of rehersals and chit-chat crossfaded to make one long pointless track.  Why not have included any number of full outtakes?  There are many good Bootlegs out there that contain full outtakes; I wonder if someone needs to let Capitol know where they can get some?  Heck, you can get quite a few by just the stuff in the movie not on the album- Suzy Parker, The fast \\"Two of Us\\", The Rock 'n' Medley, Dig it, the \\"Roof top concert\\", etc. <br />In conclusion- who is this album intended to appeal to?  I don't think the record company has a clue.  No wonder the industry is a mess.  How many CDs like this can they put out that are not what the fans want?  They continually beat there own record.  What a blown opportunity. <br />
B0009HLDFU|3.0|The great thing about the Foo Fighters is/was their ability to COMBINE soft elements and hard elements.  Here, they've separated those abilities, and while the acoustic disc is great, the loud disc smacks of trite arena rock, with all the subtleties and nuances stripped away, so it may as well be Creed or some other cruddy band.   <br /> <br />The very first song, he shouts out \\"Can you hear me?!\\" and I can just see a bunch of dumbf@#*s shouting \\"woooo\\" in response.  Ugh.  Dave then screams for the rest of the disc, and rips off this band called the Foo Fighters who have released a few great albums of similar tunes.  Seems like each Foo album rips off melodies and chord progressions from the prior discs, like Dave's seriously running out of material.  That said, if they can go back to COMBINING the loud and soft for the next album, I'll buy that one too. <br /> <br />BTW, the copy protection does not appear to be in effect for Australian discs, as I just burned copies with no problem at all.  So maybe try buying one from an Aussie company.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|Robert McNamara, the former Secretary of Defense and the man often considered responsible for the escalation of the Vietnam War, is the subject of this documentary about warfare. Mr. McNamara served under President Kennedy and later Johnson and he has much information to share about the Vietnam conflict and other military concerns from the 1960's era. He spends much of his time on this documentary directly on camera talking to the viewer about Vietnam; confessing the secrets he knew and explaining why he and others made the decisions they did.<br /><br />McNamara spills his guts in this documentary, explaining why the Vietnam War was escalated and how now regrets his failure to stand up to Johnson and demand that American troops be withdrawn. He also offers some interesting facts about the Cuban missile crisis and how close the U.S. and former Soviet Union were to an all- out nuclear war. Many citizens at the time were rightfully worried, but according to McNamara, the situation was far worse than people realize. It's the closest we have ever come to a nuclear confrontation.<br /><br />This documentary is well- organized and it is presented like a book, with chapters, conclusion, and even an epilogue. This makes it easy to follow, but it also makes it a little too academic. You feel like you really are reading from a book rather than watching a movie. And except for the background voice of the director, McNamara is the only person who talks directly to the camera on this documentary. There is archived footage showing Johnson and others giving speeches, but McNamara is the only one who talks directly.<br /><br />It's nice to hear some of the truth finally revealed but this documentary, while informative, moves at a very slow pace. Since most of the film's time is spent with McNamara talking to the viewer, it lacks much entertainment value. Many people will fall asleep unless they concentrate on what is being said. There is little action, music, or anything else to keep the viewer entertained.<br /><br />McNamara is obviously a man full of regrets and he gets a lot off his chest in this documentary. He falls short of making a full apology. But in the world of politics, what he says is sufficient. He made many mistakes and didn't tell the full truth when he was Secretary of Defense and now, on this documentary, he finally gets to tell his side of the story. It's an educational and eye- opening film to watch.ep the viewer entertained.<br /><br />McNamara is obviously a man full of regrets and he gets a lot off his chest in this documentary.

B0002XL35G|1.0|One of the worst, by one of the worst film directors of all time. They say that Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space is the worst--well, how about giving the Golden Turkey Award to this turkey instead?<br /><br />I can only say two or three good things about this dud: Nastassja Kinski is always wonderful--and what she does here is no exception. Robby Muller's cinematography is stunning. Ry Cooder's score is perfect.<br /><br />As far as everything else? Forget it. Didn't believe any of it. Harry Dean Stanton, usually very good in character rolls, is unwachable here. Why? Again, this director has a gift for being pretentious. His flicks drag on and on forever. Maybe this \\"style\\" had enough people convinced to call it art and give it the top award at Cannes back in 1984. I don't know...frankly, I have no idea how this dull flick won anything.
6305252572|5.0|Yes, this action film is the true origin of the hilarious matching of cranky Shrek and the obnoxious, adorable, devoted donkey.   <br /> <br />What begins as a formulaic (if not downright awful) cops-and-robbers flick becomes a classic right from the moment (fully 25 minutes into the story) hardboiled cop Jack Cates follows the off-key singing of convict Reggie through the cell blocks of San Quentin.  (A beloved, oft-quoted cliche).   <br /> <br />It's perennial great fun to watch the chemistry between the jaded cop (Nick Nolte) and the streetwise first-offender (Eddie Murphy), as they pair up in San Francisco to catch an escaped killer.  One of the best buddy films!  <br /> <br />The film cinched SNL star Murphy's film career, and even Nolte went against his own no-sequels policy to do it again in Another 48 Hrs.   <br />
B00005V1B1|5.0|I am not a music critic, nor would I want to be. What do they know anyway? But, I do have an opinion and for those interested in buying this disc: Camel is a criminally underrated band, considered average by most \\"critics\\". IMO they created Prog-Jazz- Rock. I am hard-pressed to find another guitarist with a more beautiful tone created by Andrew Latimer. All of these musicians are flawless on this disc. An absolute gorgeous listen, you will want more. Can't think of anything negative to say. If your reading this go ahead and click \\"BUY\\". By the way, I think \\"Mirage\\" is just a bit better than the more heralded \\"SnowGoose.\\" There you have it, my critique. Peace.
B00005JNJT|2.0|Many people think that I am destroying this film simply because I am a \\"tim burton fan.\\" This is somewhat true, only because I perfer the time burton version(s) of batman.  <br /> <br />There are many mistakes in this movie, and choices to bring the story of batman to the mainstream that dissapoint me. For one, the characters. Ra's Al Guhl is hugely misrepresented and could of been a greater (if yet the best) batman enemy. If you read the comics/saw the cartoon, bruce wayne falls in love with his daughter (which could have been played by katie holmes...not the character she DID play)...and the fact that Al Guhl needs to jump in \\"the pits\\" to revive himself of his power, which temperarilly transforms him into a madman.(where is it?!) The scarcrow was merely his henchmen, and the way the story uses his \\"fear effect\\" is definately flawed (SPOILER...) When Bruce is infected with the fear poison, he passes out for 2 days, and just takes a cure. It would have been better if it STAYED in bruce wayne's system which would have given the writer/director to give bruce \\"nightmares\\" of his past. (instead of stupid random flashbacks). Plus, could of shown the dark side of batman. <br /> <br />Another thing I would like to point out is the action...where is it? There was the fighting scene at the end, bruce vs ninjas (good) and the batmobile chase. Definately not exciting. <br /> <br />One thing that truly ruins the new age factor of batman: Using the fact that some random junkie killed bruce's parents (true in older books), when according to the old movie and the newer books, is in fact the joker (who is unnamed) who killed bruce's parents...which makes him a even more sinister enemy. <br /> <br />Props to the director for showing the training, and how bruce wanted to become batman. thumbs down on the new batmobile and how bruce \\"borrowed\\" equipment to create all his batgear. christian bale was a horrible bruce wayne. He didn't show his true anger, imo. <br /> <br />I could go onand on, but imo, if u want to see the best representation of batman... <br /> <br />watch batman the animated series or the batman/batman returns <br />
B00095MLGC|5.0|I managed to get my hands on one and purchased it and must say that I'm quite pleased with everything. For me, this album takes me on an \\"Atmospheric\\" or \\"Euphoric Journey\\". I'm referring to 2 particular songs \\"BURNING SKY\\" and \\"FADEAWAY\\". Most of the songs are instrumental \\"jamming\\" tracks. Without relying heavily on loads of vocals, Steven Wilson knew exactly what he was thinking when he recorded the original in 1994. He was and will always remain a Beethoven reincarnate or \\"Musical Genius\\". From the first keyboard notes from \\"FADEAWAY\\", I'm swept away to another time & place. These 2 particular songs do it for me!<br /><br />Having been Remastered & Re-recorded, the sound on \\"UTD\\" is much richer and fuller than on the original 1994 release. It was originally supposed to be available to Canada & USA as of 06/07/05, but they had printing problems & held back the release for 2 weeks. I didn't take a chance with ordering it online, so instead I ordered instore 2 weeks ago and here it is in my hands today.<br /><br />With the new drummer (Gavin Harrison), he's replaced the old programmed drums with his own live drum tracks, contributing to the much more \\"put together\\" PT sound. I've grown accustomed to seeing & hearing live drums and drum solos at the PT concerts, so I was quite anxious to hear this recording. There have been subtle changes in every aspect in this project. I didn't notice them, but they are there after listening to the album more than once.<br />This is good, because when something has been changed drastically, the feel has been lost.<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful, housing the CDs in a glossy 4-fold digipack. Each CD is glossy black with silver titling. Really simple & nice. Inside my copy, I found an advert for the \\"Blackfield\\" CD with release info. On the front side is the picture of the front cover of \\"Blackfield\\" CD. When you open the CD package, the first \\"fold\\" houses the booklet, printed on a semi-matte paper. Anyone who's not familiar with Blackfield.......they are Steven Wilson & Aviv Geffen (From Israel). Their music is amazing & very \\"PT\\" based. Without SW's influence, the album would certainly be lacking!<br /><br />\\"Up The Downstair\\" is actually among the top 3 of my fave PT studio recordings. Stupid Dream still remains on top. ;-) I'm anxious to read the comments from other fans in near-future reviews, because there will be some who'll complain about the minor changes.<br /><br />Between this album and \\"Stupid Dream\\", I feel the \\"Pink Floyd\\" influence. And because of this, PT's drawn me closer to their music since the past 5 years.<br /><br />I do have the \\"Staircase Infinities\\" CD (Still sealed), as well as the cassette, so the music on the re-issued CD comes as no surprise. Steve Wilson recorded a couple new pieces, one of those being a re-working of a track from the cassette days. There are only 5 tracks total, about 30 minutes.<br /><br />It's damned good stuff for the collector & will make any PT fan happy if they haven't purchased \\"Staircase Infinites\\" elsewhere online.

B0007Y08QA|5.0|A \\"breakdown\\" review...<br /><br />--THE PLOT: A man who works in a dead-end job with factory machines begins to question his own reality as he struggles to do the most basic things in life. Sleep, more than any other activity, challenges him relentlessly.<br /><br />---WHO WILL DEFINITELY like \\"The Machinist\\":  fans of \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" \\"Memento,\\" \\"Donnie Darko,\\" \\"Lantanna\\" and other unconventional films with twists and turns...fans of \\"Sixth Sense,\\" though, may not care for this deep, disturbing film since the latter is very conventional and over-hyped...<br /><br />--KEEP IN MIND: While THE MACHINIST tends to get a bit carried away with symbolism at times and thinks it's being subtle when it's not, there is still something lush, eerie and captivating that gets under your fingernails and soul. Christian Bale literally put his life on the line for this role as he shed 65 pounds and looks like he is about to die at any moment. Even more startling that his gaunt appearance is how believable he is as a man tormented by what he does and doesn't know about himself.<br /><br />--WHY IT STAYS WITH YOU: Because underneath the stark, ugly colors and clever departures from reality is a gritty, brutal truth about what guilt can do to a person. Even though part of me  doesn't think it's a good idea for an actor or actress to lose so much weight, I can't see how it could have been done any other way. Anyone who has ever been emotionally distraught or wracked with guilt can tell you that the way Bale looks in THE MACHINIST isn't far-fetched at all: guilt is the great destroyer and the body and mind its victims...
0316548189|4.0|INTRO: This is the first book of this size that I have read about S. Africa. Having many relatives from S. Africa , I've heard the white side of the story about post-apartheid atrocities and unfairness, but this is the first history I've read of the history before 1994. This book really is fascinating in seeing the black perspective of the problem as well as chronologically laying out the evolution of the struggle. <br /> <br />BODY: An important thing to keep in mind is that this book is written by Nelson Mandela himself who is not a partial bystander. Many times in fact, the book reads like a training manual for aspiring revolutionaries. While the history of the book is not in question, you need to understand that he paints them in a very specific light. At the end of the book, you hear nothing about any killings on behalf of the ANC only about the killings which were done to them. Another example of the political agenda of this book is near the beginning when Nelson Mandela makes the statement that the tribal politics that existed before the white man was \\"democracy in it's purest form\\".  <br /> <br />CONCLUSION: You should enjoy this book and admire Nelson Mandela for his lifetime of sacrifice and devotion to racial equality. However, don't place all your eggs in one basket and realize that there is more to the story than that of the radical revolutionary Mandela's. This book has inspired me to look further into S. Africa's present and past history.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This is a great new direction for Warner Bros' Batman series. It's much edgier and realistic than the previous films, and lacking much of the campiness found in \\"Batman and Robin.\\" Christopher Nolan's incredible direction certainly shines through on this film as we see a more human side to Batman, and we explore the difficulty of managing two lives.<br /><br />There were only a few flaws with this film, but they were pretty major ones. The romance between Wayne and Rachel (Katie Holmes) seemed too forced and wasn't developed enough. It was given may be 5 minutes' time in the movie and I just didn't care enough about her character or their past because I didn't know anything about it. I don't even recall them kissing in the film. This could be setting up for future films but she just felt like a character that could have been left out.<br /><br />The action. There just weren't enough scenes of Batman. He was in costume for maybe 10 minutes of the movie, if that much, and it just wasn't the Batman we're used to from the comic books. Granted, this was an origin story and he's not supposed to be proficient at crime fighting, but I would like to see more of it.<br /><br />Lastly, the enemies were very sub-par. Scarecrow was not very evil, and went down very easily. Ras didn't impress me much either. I don't want over-dramatic acting from Jim Carrey or Arnold Schwarzenegger, but I would like a little more evil in the film. This wasn't what I would call a \\"Superhero movie.\\" It was more of a gritty action film that happened to have the main character in a cape some of the time.<br /><br />Even with these \\"flaws\\" as I consider them, maybe this is why I enjoyed the film so much. It's much more believable than the past films, especially when we see Batman falter while trying to use his new gadgets or become accustomed to his new skills. This isn't a Batman that can easily get around any situation, so I respected him more. If you want a huge Bruckheimer/Bay Summer popcorn movie, you'll probably have to wait for \\"War of the Worlds,\\" but if you like some decent writing and want a new look at the Batman franchise, you should definitely check out \\"Batman Begins.\\"or \\"War of the Worlds,\\" but if you like some decent writing and want a new look at the Batman franchise, you should definitely check out \\"Batman Begins.\\"
B0000AXE8I|4.0|This whole trilogy is very unique and amzing and just absolutely amazing in terms of visuals. Reloaded is my favorite one though and it earned the 4 stars alone because of the action scenes. From the milllllllions of agent Smiths vs. Neo, to the fight against the frenchman's henchmen, to the awesome chase, it's original and just awesome. This movie could have definitely been one of the best movies ever but it feels confused. The plot feels confused with the sometimes bad acting to the weird story with some very random and pointless scenes. The movie also gets very boring and repetitive at times but the action scenes will leave you in such awe and amazement that you'll buy this movie just to rewatch them because stuff like this only occurs in this trilogy.
1592220053|5.0|Originally a collection of shorts published in Analog magazine as a continuing saga, Tuf Voyaging is all the pieces put together into a smooth novel with an extremely unique protagonist.<br /><br />Haviland Tuf and his ship, the 'Cornucopia Of Excellent Goods At Low Prices', has been hired by a group of five people to travel towards what is known as The Plague Star.  When upon arriving, they discover it is not a star at all but a long abandoned Seedship, left over from the war a thousand years ago.  Their first problem is getting past the ship's automated defenses and boarding, their second problem is the greed that has filled every head except Tuf's.<br /><br />Tuf, of course, winds out in charge of the Seedship, named the Ark.  (no details, just read the book!  The first chapter details these events, and is most excellent!)  the remaining six chapters chronicle Tuf's voyages from planet to planet, using the Ark to solve problems such as overpopulation, sea monsters, cruel animal-fighting pits, and religious plagues.<br /><br />Eccentric and droll would be the best way to describe Haviland Tuf, a very tall and very large bald man.  He travels alone, except for his cats, Havoc and Mushroom.  The cat family expands, and Tuf is inspired by his human encounters to name the new kittens Suspicion, Doubt, Hostility, Ingratitude, and Foolishness.  Tuf is a loner, intelligent, peculiar, a vegetarian with an enormous appetite, and a dry wit.  Indeed.<br /><br />The Seedship is a marvelous invention of Martin's, thirty kilometers long and three kilometers high, the pinnacle of the old Earth Ecological Corps inventions.  Although the EEC used their Seedships for war, Tuf has only benign uses for it.  Inside the Ark are stored millions and millions of cell samples, and all the equipment, including a chronowarp engine, to genetically engineer or clone any species.<br /><br />Travel with Tuf through space, and revisit the planet S'uthlam (three chapters have S'uthlam) where Tully Mune is the acerbic Portmaster who lives her life in zero gravity.  Tully's will and determination prove to be a match for Tuf, and the chapters in which they face off with each other are excellent.<br /><br />This is SciFi at it's best, very character oriented with enough strange planets, strange beings, strange traditions, and technology to satisfy the hungriest of SciFi palates.  Even more enjoyable if you are a cat lover like myself.  Get out and buy this book now!  Enjoy!here Tully Mune is the acerbic Portmaster who lives her life in zero gravity.

B000068G9X|5.0|I have been a danzig fan for years, every band he has been in has been great from Misfits, Samhain to Danzig, I own every danzig album, I have not been disappointed with any of them. The best Danzig albums are Danzig II: Lucifuge, Danzig IV. This album is very good it has one of my favorite songs, Twist of Cain, I enjoy at least 90% of this album, it is a very strong album. Danzig has a great voice and awesome lyrics..Enjoy
B0002OERI0|5.0|Okay, this review isn't specifically about this album, so I don't really care what you rate it. It's about music in general. Why does everyone care what music everyone else listens to? You don't need to start \\"anti\\" sites about a band just because you don't like them, what difference will it make if someone likes different music then you? Oh no! Will they magically appear in your room, and change the songs on your IPod? Just because Green Day may not be \\"punk\\" doesn't mean they suck, everyone has different taste, even if they DO think that they are punk, and realize that they may not be, it's not like they are magically going to change for you. I hate some bands, but I don't waste my time making those anti-band sites that are a waste of internet space, not to mention a waste of your own time! Just because it is played on MTV doesn't mean it \\"sucks\\", and just because it's \\"underground\\" doesn't mean that it has no fans. Not all bands that you see on TV are sellouts, did you ever think that maybe, just maybe, they are mainstream because they are popular? That's what happened to Linkin Park, they started out underground, and now they are mainstream because their fans spread the message. Even if  some bands ARE manufactured, the music can still be good. So next time, think twice about bashing a band that you might not even have given a chance to, or a band that you don't like, because what's the point on wasting your breath on something that you hate?    By the way, I love this album, I find it very different from their others, although it is more pop. Green Day is my favorite band, and I hope that they continue making their music for years.    No! I did not write this review because I didn't want people to only stop bashing Green Day, I was reading the comments here, and I couldn't take it anymore, so I wrote my opinion here. It's for everyone who's been bashed, from Hilary Duff, to Cradle Of Filth. I don't care if you found what I wrote a waste of space, I only  wroteit for those who had a chance of understanding my message.  For all of you whom this message didn't get through your thick skull into your brain, try saying: \\"They are poseurs\\" one more time, maybe those words will jump out of the screen, and bite the fans.

B000929AJQ|4.0|Ok. I'm not going to go on about myself being a huge fan and all that crap. I'll get straight to the point. With Teeth is a very good NIN album. I wouldn't say it was better than the Fragile, but it's still quite good. In fact, the only reason I give this album 4 stars is because some of Trent's lyrics are VERY weak. Not as bad as the lastest CD from Marilyn Manson, but for Trent Reznor, weak. &quot;I drag this net behind me, and it picks up feelings...&quot; is probly the weakest lyric in the whole album. Now words aside, Some songs are some of the best to date. If you're not sure about this album, or are wondering how different this album is from the rest, then I recommand trying the most un NIN sounding song on this album &quot;Getting Smaller&quot;. What a great rocking tune but it doesn't sound like a NIN song at all. Also the title track &quot;With Teeth&quot; has snunk in a banjo, which sounds good. So if you don't mind some weak lyrics here and there, then this is an album for you, even if you're not a NIN fan.
B00008PC2O|5.0|This awesome sequel to the Terminator is a science fiction/action movie with some nice comedic moments. In this movie Arnold is back but this time is a good robot sent from the future to protect John Connor. He learns catch phrases from John which he uses in awesome and funny moments. But, there is also antoher robot sent back who can adopt different people's appearances and can make realllllllllllyyyyyyyy sharp objects with his hands and fingers. This movie has the governator beating people up, blowing up cop cars with a minigun, and fighting a stronger robot. The action scenes are classic and shall always be remembered and the scenes of the future may seem cheesy now but were absolutely amazing for the time. This is a must see movie. From the opening sequence with Arnold arriving all naked and going into a bar to find a proper outfit to to the vilain telling the pilot of a helicopter ot \\"get out\\" (which he does and so would I as my life means more than my bones!!!!!!!) to the awesome conclusion!!!!! It's a sweet finale!!!! This is Arnold's best movie and is just absolutely amazing!
B0008KLVG4|4.0|The dominance of the Hollywood summer blockbuster can be attributed (or blamed depending on how you feel about them) to two filmmakers: Steven Spielberg with Jaws and George Lucas with Star Wars. But Spielberg was there first with Jaws, an exciting adventure film about a great white shark terrorizing a small, seaside town that scared the crap out of millions of people the year it came out. The movie was a bonafide phenomenon, becoming the first one to ever surpass $100 million at the box office.<br /><br />Jaws holds up today because it is an adventure film that doesn't rely solely on exciting action sequences. Its foundation is a strong story and engaging characters with memorable dialogue (most notably the famous monologue that Quint delivers with chilling intensity). More importantly, we care about what happens to these characters and that is something a lot of Jaws imitators failed to copy successfully. Spielberg and co. essentially created a contemporary monster movie that works so well because it plays on a primary fear of being in the water and not having control of one's environment (i.e. drowning). As a result, Jaws has aged well over three decades while its numerous sequels and imitators have not.<br /><br />When Jaws was released on DVD to commemorate its 25th anniversary it was heavily criticized for including a truncated version Laurent Bouzereau's excellent feature-length Making Of documentary. For the 30th anniversary they've rectified this situation but unless you're a devotee it's not really worth the double-dip. Gone from the previous version is the trivia game, the Shark World documentary, the trailers and the screen saver so completists might want to hold on to their old discs.<br /><br />On the first DVD are 13 minutes worth of deleted scenes and outtakes. There is more footage of the crime scene of the first shark attack and a nice bit where Quint playfully mocks some poor kid for playing a clarinet in a music store.<br /><br />New to this edition is \\"From the Set,\\" a profile on the movie done on location. A British film crew follows a young Spielberg around and interviews him, providing an interesting snapshot of the then up-and-coming filmmaker.<br /><br />The second DVD features the real reason to purchase this edition (aside from the excellent movie, of course), a two-hour retrospective documentary restored to its full glory. It covers all the usual bits: the mechanical shark that rarely worked, the mercurial presence of Robert Shaw, the source of Quint's famous monologue, and so on. This is a fascinating, in-depth look at how Jaws came together, the challenges that a young Spielberg faced and the eventual phenomenon that developed as the film thrilled audiences all over the world.<br /><br />Also included are galleries of storyboards by Tom Wright, production photos taken on location, and movie posters and ads from all over the world.<br /><br />Finally, there is an attractive 60-page photo journal with glossy stills and quotes from cast, crew and the movie.his edition is \\"From the Set,\\" a profile on the movie done on location.

0553213105|5.0|I've watched the movie a few times and read the book twice, and I'm still as excited as the first time I read it!  The characters are awesome, and I feel my heart all aflutter just like Elizabeth's when she finds herself in love with Mr. Darcy....*sigh*.<br /><br />A classic that can really never go out of style.
B0009MAP90|4.0|When this album was first recorded, it was early in the life of stereo, with the guitar was on one track, the voice on the other.  With this new upgrade that is no longer the case, the instuments and the voice are intergrated making it sound much more real than the original.  This has never been one of my favorite Dylan albums, but the remastering here has enhanced it the point that it's like listening to it with fresh ears.  This is no more apparent than on \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", which sounds like your in the room with him, and clearly enhances the emotional impact of the performance.  Don't miss this one.
B000006FYP|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I thought that it was the best Batman film out of the 4 films. There were alot of cool effects, and exciting action scenes that rivaled the last two. Val Kilmer was better than Keaten in my opinion. I hated the last film, because it totally killed Batman for me.
B000244EMO|5.0|Well, this movie doesn't deserve 5 stars, it probably deserves only 4 but the humor in the movie caused by Arnold, probably accidentally makes it worthy of 5 stars. After throwing a knife at a man which sticks him to the wall, he says: \\"stick around..\\"!!!!!!!! Hilarious!!!! His moaning when he is hurt and \\"he can't see me...\\" and \\"GO TO DA CHOPPERRRRRRRR!!\\" makes it hilarious. But without Ahnold's stupid humor, there's actually a good classic movie here. The story centers around a group of soldiers that have dissapeared. Arnold and his group of elite soldiers must then go to the jungle to find out what happen. But soon, they realize that their enemy isn't human. Of course, you already know what's going to happen, that everyone's going to die besides Arnold. So that's not giving away anything... But, some great action scenes, the creation of a new, original, classic, and awesome vilain, and some cheesy one liners by the governator make this one a great movie.
B00006LWSF|5.0|I never thought i would hear such a great soundtrack. Maybe it is because i am a rap fan but this was just so great.Eminem wasn't the only one who shone on this album.50 and Trice broyught it along with Nas and Xzibit. Every beat was tight.&quot;Love Me&quot; was kind of a haunting slow beat but was still dope.
0345423496|4.0|I really enjoyed this series, and I definitely enjoyed this last installment of Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey series.  I felt the novel told a clear tale of Frank Poole's reintegration into society a thousand years later and his eventual showdown with the human race against the Monolith on Europa. <br /> <br />The novel isn't just about these two things though.  It discusses the place of humanity in the universe, and the idea of exceedingly advanced civilizations attempting to play God, for right or wrong.  It also focuses on Frank's daily struggles, as well as the significant events of his life after his resurrection, such as having a family, having a job, and losing dear friends. <br /> <br />The novel also (logically) continues with the idea of Halman (the Monolith created blend of the essence of HAL and Dave Bowman) interacting/guiding humanity on occasion. <br /> <br />Like the previous novels, 3001 is described by Clarke with significant visual details and the reader is able to practically create these environments mentally and follow the main characters on their journeys. <br /> <br />The book was not especially long or difficult to read, nor did it leave numerous questions waiting to be answered.
B0006L16N8|3.0|The oblique reference is to the Seinfeld episode where George revels in getting under someone's skin, like the commercial jingle \\"By Mennen...\\"  X&Y is kind of like that. There's not much new, it's merely a blander continuation of the last two records. (both of which I own and like very much)  Yet I keep hearing the chorus of \\"What If\\" in my head, and it won't go away...  Coldplay has a formula and they are sticking to it.  The album sounds like it was designed not to offend anybody, and it probably won't, but it won't inspire anyone either, except maybe subconsciously, because these songs will probably be everywhere, even in a commercial or two.  If I could give X&Y 2.5 stars I would, because everything about the record is safe and down the middle.   <br /> <br />Just once I wish they'd break out and go wild the way The Who always could.  Think of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", a beautiful, pretty thing and then boom, Daltry's screaming, \\"would you stick your finger down my throat?\\"  Granted Chris Martin doesn't have a Pete Townsend to play against, but if he gets any more neutral, we'll all be putting our fingers down our throats.     <br />
B00005K3NR|4.0|Carrie is a good horror movie based on the book by Stephen king and it contains some tense and one horrifyingly scary scene. The movie isn't that scary but it's a lot scarrirer than most horror movies. Sissy Spacek gives a great performance as a very unique girl named Carrie who has psychic powers. She isn't popular and is always mocked by people but always keeps her powers under restraint. Her mother is very creepy and is a complete nutcase that locks her in the closet at times. Well, you know what's going to happen, something's going to drive Carrie absolutely nuts. And you won't believe what she does. I don't want to give away anything but believe the mom is freaky. John Travolta gives a good performance as one of the popualr kids in school. I recommend to be aware at the end of the movie or else you might jump off the couch like I did.(It's not over until the credits, believe me)
B00082ZS5W|5.0|Dido has 2 cd's out with all great songs on them, she now puts out a concert dvd that is incredible, the future looks bright for this hot young lady!!  This dvd is great, the audio is un-believable and the video is just fine(I can't believe anybody would complain about it).  I own over 100 concert dvd's and this dvd ranks right up the their with one of my favorites.All I can say is if you like even one Dido song, you should get this dvd/cd and you will be surprised how unbelievably talented Dido really is!  She should be a lot more popular in the US than she is.
B0007GAERG|5.0|ABSOLUTELY NOTHING... MARIAH HAS DONE IT AGAIN! SHE IS THE FIRST ARTIST SINCE BEYONCE RELEASED \\"DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE\\" TO COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN EVERY OTHER ARTIST IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY WITH A PERFECT, WELL BALANCED, SOON TO BE GREATEST ALBUM RELEASE EVER.  I REALLY HAVE TO GIVE HER THE CREDIT SHE DISERVES BECUASE SHE INDEED EARNED EVERY BIT OF IT.  IF YOU HAVEN'T BROUGHT IT GO GET IT, THE BALADS WILL HAVING YOU \\"GOING IN CIRCLES\\", AND THE CAMEOS ARE EXCELLENT.  SHE COLLABERATED WITH THE NEPTUNES, WHICH WAS A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN, AND JUST CRUCIFIED EVERY OTHER CD THAT CAME OUT THIS YEAR.  GOOD JOB MIMI
B0002VEX7S|5.0|There are lots of celtic singers out there and I won't try to detract or impune their music, but Loreena is simply in a class all by herself.  I have been listening to and buying her music since PARALLEL DREAMS was released in 1994.  THE BOOK OF SECRETS is her latest and best effort.  I never tire of listening to it.  The depth and expanse of each arrangement is a true masterful work of art, and she has the most enchanting soprano voice you will ever hear.  Words really cannot describe the poetic perfection of this CD.  But sufice it to say that if I had to run from a burning house, I would grab it on the way out.  This is celtic music at its' very root.  So do yourself a favor and buy it.
B0002234LS|4.0|Secret Window is based on the novella by Stephen King which I never read. The movie for one is a really good movie with lots of twists, frights, and comic moments. The movie is about writer Mort Rainey, portrayed by Johnny Depp very well, who is living a calm life with his small dog on the outscurts of a small town. His ex wife lives in his real house in the city but they still haven't filed papers for the divorce. Mort is still haunted by peeping in on her and seeing her in bed with an other man. She claims she didn't cheat on him but he thinks otherwise.... Well anyway, everything's going fine for him until John Shooter comes to his house. This man's from Mississipi and is brilliantly portrayed by John Turturro. This small writer claims that Mort has stolen his story who denies it but when Shooter leaves a copy of his story, Mort realizes that they are identical. And then Shooter goes absolutely crazy and things start happening. Bad things. For one, don't get attached to the dog like I did. But, this horror movie with some very comic moments is one of the best horror movies of the last couple of years. Turturro's performance will always be remembered by me as one of the best EVER. You should see it just for that and for his awesome performance. His performance is even better than it was in the Birdcage, which was also great. Johnny Depp on top of it is wonderful as usual and adds a lot to it. This horror movie is surprisingly good and scary and I strongly recommend it.
6305291446|1.0|I was a big fan of the original Halloween. I even loved the second film. The third film was a complete and utter waste of time that had absolutly NOTHING to do with Michael Myers, and parts 4,5, and 6 were all fair follow ups...However, with this addition, It only left me baffled and incredibly irritated that the writers have CONTINUED to mix the story lines up even more. What happened to Jamie Lloyd, the daughter of Laurie Strode's character?? There were 3 films that involved her character and now those 3 films are supposed to basically just be null and void??? What is the reasoning for that??? I hated that they just left those three films in the dust and had no reference or mention to whatever happened to Jamie Lloyd, and why all of a sudden her character has never existed after we invested 3 movies into her (she did die in the 6th film though, so that was a bummer)...Also, this movie was just boring. There is something entirely cheesy about this movie that I can't seem to put my finger on. The directing is far too over the top and glossy looking. Horror movies of today seem to lack what slasher films of the 70's and 80's had in grainy and eerie lighting and camera work. The crisp pictures and smooth camera movements seem to take away that extra BAM! of horror. The writing for this movie is awful and the characters are hard to connect to. Jamie Lee Curtis is even hard to connect to. That is probably due to the fact that she has become a hardened, oppresive, and dull LUSH with a bevy of emotional issues (no thanks to her immortal psycho killing machine brother). Even worse than this film though is the follow up-Halloween Resurrection, which is barely even tolerable to sit through once. I hope that part 9 is at least somewhat decent...although I don't have any idea where they are going to venture with the story line.
B000002U8G|5.0|With \\"Meddle\\" Pink Floyd had finally come together as a band.  That is to say, they finally after 5 years and 5 albums fleshed out and fully developed their post Syd-Barrett sound. This album broke any link (musically that is) to Barrett and Floyd fans will forever argue about the merits of that. In any case while this album was in many ways a warmup to Dark Side... it stands up on it's own quite well, and it's only drawback is \\"Echoes\\" which shows some lingering aftereffects of Floyd's 60's overindulgence.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|<br /> This is the greatest rock album of all time. If you don't believe me, goto [...] and listen to some samples.  <br /> <br /> And if you still don't believe me, then you better clean your ears out.
B0000DZTIW|4.0|Hans Zimmer is almost as well known as John Williams now for his majestic wonders of a mix of industrial synthesizers and traditional orchestral mystiques. Ever since his intense and triumphant score for Tony Scott's \\"Crimson Tide\\" in '96, his career has been at an ever climbing rate. It is a style of music I have longed for in film's and Zimmer catches to it without difficulty or flaw in some.  <br /> <br />The Last Samurai is a curiously different tone for him and a well deserved one as well after doing so many barouqe and outloud chords. It is beautifully well toned and is more of a contemporary score, rythmed with absolutely amazing combination of violin and eastern pipes along with a synthesized woodwind flow. In other tracks, he combines this light tone with his barouqe brass underlining the use of traditional Japanese cultural instruments, namely the strong willed percussion. It weaves through in a calm and collective state, inspiring strong feeling. It is almost flawless, except for the Braveheart similar stand-off to the battle and some chords and changes that don't fit in with the flow of the music or tone. <br /> <br />All of this carries on a film that is very sensitive to its itself with beautiful cinematography, some very decent performances (one by a different Tom Cruise), with a calmly paced style of storytelling, despite that some scenes and incidents are questionable and bordeline Hollywood characteristics. It is a truly notable and memorable reprisal for Edward Zwick, a filmmaker struggling to redeem his career. <br /> <br />This is definently one of Hans Zimmer's greatest compositions and is well worth ditching money and time for. I very often use this soundtrack for my meditation rituals and it is great for relaxing your mind and getting in touch with your senses. Four out of five stars.
B000002UAX|5.0|Want to know what it was like to be a young adult in 1968?  Give this disc a listen, because if there ever was a time capsule from The Sixties, The White Album is it.<br /><br />The universal attraction and appreciation of this eclectic collection of songs is that it has something for everyone. Different people get different things from it. Yeah, there is some idiosyncratic stuff here, but its great rock 'n roll and classic pop tunes hold this collection together.<br /><br />You have Heavy Metal Birthday wishes, faux-Beach-Boy-I-love-Russky-Chick love ballads, sounds of demonstation/battle/football for the politically-polarized, Lennon English Blues riffs, fairy tales for the kids, silly love songs from Paul, Guitars Gently Weeping, the Rocky Raccoon Talking Blues, and gender-bending/role switching Obla-di-Obla-Da.<br /><br />Amazon reviewer Phil Rogers described it perfectly-- \\"listening to The White Album was a social event that extended far beyond the music into all corners of our lives.\\"<br /><br />On my way to adding 'The White Album' to my wish list, I paused and saw 876 Customer reviews with an average of 4 1/2 stars!  If that isn't a testamonial to buy a record, what is?
B000002U9W|4.0|With Atom Heart Mother, Pink Floyd used the lessons learned (unlearned?) from Ummagumma, and their own growing confidence as songwriters to make an album that rather than go in the mroe traditional direction of say \\"More\\" lapsed back to, then expanded upon the type of album that \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\" was. The main difference however is that Pink Floyd were finally starting to master their instruments and were coming together as a group and it shows on this album.  Say what you will about the songs,  This album in many ways is their first semi-cohesive group effort. Yes the two end songs are overindulgent, and the middle songs fair, but really unremarkable, but Atom Heart Mother was the arrow that pointed out the direction PInk Floyd were headed in.
B000002UJQ|4.0|really started to dig the band hearing \\"Paranoid Android\\" and \\"Karma Police\\" on the Radio. OK Computer is ranked as one of the best albums ever, i think that's slightly overrated - since I think they got even Better after this one. Still this one got me interested in the band, and for a short time i didn't think it could get any better, that is until i got used to Kid A and Amnesiac. But this album has got perhaps their best song ever, \\"Exit music for a Film\\". The song just gives me shivers... in a good way. \\"Filter Happier\\" is pretty pointless though. Oh and you gotta check out the singles they released in this period. Some of B-sides are better than anything here, like \\"Polyetheline\\" \\"Pearly\\" and \\"How to be a millionaire\\".
B0009I7NNA|5.0|First off I know most Avenged Sevenfold fans were let down by this album because of the lack of screaming. I dont see how that is a big deal because metal never even had this out of key screaming sh*t untill the past few years. What ever happened to people singing. This whole metalcore thing kind of reminds me of rap because just like rappers all the metal singers are just screaming with the beat or flow of the song. Why is it so wrong to actually be talented and sing in the same key the band is playing now? It takes no talent or time to scream, but it does take talent and time to learn your notes and be able to switch octaves like all of the great metal bands like: Iron Maiden, Metallica, Megadeth and so on. So my point here is I think that this album shows that Shadows actually can sing in a key and earns the right to be called a musician. Although his voice is not at its strongest right now I think he has potential. But my main reason for rating this 5 stars is because of the band. This could be some of the best guitar playing Ive heard since Appetite for Destruction. Its too bad Avenged Sevenfold will lose some of there following after this, but hopefully they get a new following of metal fans who are like myself and don't call people sellouts for signing with a big record company, who don't accuse them as sounding like someone else in a bad way, and people who listen to music for the music and not the image.
B0008ISM40|5.0|The newest installment from nine inch nails hits the umm, nail on the head.  I was a little unsure of how the new album would sound and be recieved after a six year hiatus by trent reznor.  The first single sounded, well, a little too radio friendly at first listen. But it has grown on me more and more after every listen. After Mr. Reznors decision not to play the mtv awards because mtv execs had issues with his artistic vision of performing THTF with the commander-and-thief as a backdrop, it's clear that he is sticking to his guns and that this album is a clear and focused endeavor.   <br />Every track is a standout in itself, from the new wave track ONLY to the hard and heavy YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE, and the ethereal RIGHT WHERE IT BELONGS, nin has completed an opus that  <br />is both musically relevant and inspirational. <br /> <br />5 stars in an understatement.   <br />Thanks for a great album!! <br />See you in concert this fall. <br />
B000002U82|5.0|Actually created in 1972, Dark Side of the Moon brought together the band's developing talents as musicians, and Roger Water's ability as a songwriter and focused them both to a point where they achieved a work of art that in my opinion hasn't been achieved before or since. This is a good example of an album that should really be listened to as an album, or record, rather than a tape or cd.  I can't really explain it; older fans will know what I mean, younger folk probably never will.  The thing is with cd players it's just too easy to skip ahead to your favorite song.. when you're semi-forced to listen to an album in it's entirety, watching the needle slowly move across the record as this melodic rock-symphony just melts into your soul with a richness and depth lost by modern sound systems, it's an experience quite unlike anything one could experience today.  Anyway enough ranting about the death of vinyl.  Dark Side of the Moon was on the charts for over 14 years, and still occasionally pops up on the top 100,  is there any more proof of that that you should run out today and get this album if you don't have it?
B000005IU2|5.0|What can I say? This is one GREAT follow-up. Right when the excellent \\"Down on the street\\" starts it becomes obvious that its a  <br />huge improvement over the debut, even the bass player plays tight on this record! And Iggy's just all over the record with his screams and awesome noises. I just love \\"Down on the Street\\" its so damn catchy and the chorus just tears through your speakers. \\"Loose\\", \\"TV eye\\", \\"Dirt\\" all great and incredibly catchy. Im not really fond of the last track \\"LA Blues\\" though. But this album just deserves a 5 star rating!
B000002UJQ|2.0|I listened to the samples and that was enough.  It sounds like it would be a decent album, but it only has this many stars because of the fans.  Right off the top of my head, I can think of 3 albums from the 90's that are better.   Tonic - Lemon Parade, and Stone Temple Pilots first two albums.  It's a shame...this generations music is so unfortunate.  There are no musicians anymore.  Try some 70's and 80's.  Those were the best decades.
0786890754|5.0|I just finished this book a few days ago and to be honest I could not put the book down! It was amazing. I have been doing a lot of reading lately, but until now have not found a book that is so insightful. If you have lost someone special in your life whether through death or a break up this book will speak to you. Holly goes through the trials and tribulations of getting over Gerry after he dies. It is sweet and written for the heart. Life is a journey that we all have to take and it is not always easy, but instead of living from the past......use the past to springboard you into the future. I recommend this book to anyone who is going through a difficult time in his or her life!
B000002UA0|5.0|Piper at the Gates of Dawn sounds unlike any other Pink Floyd Album, simply because it's the only one with Syd Barrett.  In fact, this album is really unlike any other album ever recorded, so I really think it's best when judged on it's own merits, and it doesn't disappoint. The songs are engaging, funny, trippy, and experimental, if not technically well played. This being said there are brief flashes of what Pink Floyd would later become (notable is the harmony towards the end of \\"bike\\"), but if this Pink Floyd is viewed as a different band entirely from what would come later this album can be appreciated by anyone.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Yes I'm a musician. Yes I'm jealous. How can you still write a masterpiece in 2005, when you have the feeling that musically everything has already been done. Bands like U2 get stuck in their mediocre loop holes, not being able to release something original.  <br />Coldplay manages to release something fresh. X&Y is great. They take the sound of \\"a rush of blood..\\", add a little more 80s influences, hire a diffrent producer, and the result rocks.  <br />\\"Fix You\\" is just beautiful, I love the start with the organ. \\"X&Y\\" has a GREAT bass line, really catchy. Their first single \\"Speed of Sound\\" could be on \\"a rush of blood\\", smart to release it as the first single, picking up right where they left. <br />Get this album now!
B0009NSE1K|4.0|I'm going to get the negativity out of the way first. I was slightly disappointed in this album. It was not as heavy or raw as previous Clutch albums, but I will be the first to admit that I saw them going in a different musical direction with \\"Blast Tyrant.\\" Still, I find this album to be an excellent addition to the Clutch arsenal. To be honest, I'm still not sure if I like the keyboards, but this album definitely had some high points. As usual, the musicianship of this band is tight and spot-on perfect. Neil Fallon certainly has a way with words, and has an unparalleled delivery. Dan is an excellent bassist who never ceases to impress me with his ability to lay down a perfect groove. Jean Paul is one of the world's most underrated drummers,who relies more on talent and substance than on flash and style. Tim's groove-heavy guitar riffs are as original as they are incredible. In my not-so-humble opinion, Clutch is one of the world's most underrated bands, and this album should be viewed as a stand-alone work (instead of being compared with other Clutch albums) to truly be enjoyed.
B000002J1U|4.0|With Led Zeppelin's fourth album being one of the greatest-selling albums of all time, \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" covering the \\"House of the Holy\\" era, and many musicians hailing \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" as a favorite, it seems that \\"Led Zeppelin III\\" is a bit overlooked.  That's too bad, because I think it's a wonderfully diverse album with great, memorable songs. <br /> <br />The heavy guitar riffs of \\"Immigrant Song\\" kick off the album, with Robert Plant belting out an eerie but catchy call reminiscent of \\"Bali Ha'i\\" or even \\"Get Smart\\".  It's arguably one of band's most driving, metal-sounding songs of their catalog.  Then after an odd bit of background chatter, the opening chord to \\"Friends\\" is struck.  This acoustic song includes background strings and an oddly dissonant quality to it that gives it all a rather dark feeling.  The song ends in a synth drone, and it was revealed later that this was done to cover up a studio mistake: the original introduction to the next track, \\"Celebration Day\\", was accidentally erased!  In any case, \\"Celebration Day\\" greatly picks up the mood and the pace, as its title would suggest. <br /> <br />\\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is a great slow blues number, with a nice long jam-outs in several parts.  Unfortunately, the uneditable squeak of John Bonham's bass drum pedal can be heard throughout.  When I first noticed this back in the day, I thought something was wrong with my tape!  The first half of the album (or \\"side one\\", for those of us who originally bought this album on vinyl or cassette) concludes with \\"Out on the Tiles\\", an up-beat rocker with complex yet very catchy guitar riffs.  The title is a British slang term for spending a night out on the town, and the main melody of the riffs were actually based off one written by John Bonham. <br /> <br />The second half of the album is all acoustic.  \\"Gallows Pole\\" is a cover of a traditional song, but Zep's interpretation really make it sound like their own.  \\"Tangerine\\", which JimmyPage actually had written back in his days with the Yardbirds, is a tragic-sounding song with a very country-sounding chorus.  Ditto for the next track, the melancholy \\"That's The Way\\".   <br /> <br />\\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\" has a great bluegrass feel, and between Page's fast guitar licks and Bonham's steady bass drum, you can't help but to imagine an additional musician in overalls blowing on a jug in the corner.  The odd title by the way is a reference to \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\", which means \\"The Golden Breast\\" and was a cabin where the band often retreated to relax and write new songs.  The album concludes with the odd slide guitar and effect-laden vocals of \\"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper\\".  Roy Harper is an English folk musician who toured with the band and worked with some of the members individually in later years, though is probably best known for guest starring on Pink Floyd's song \\"Have a Cigar\\". <br /> <br />I have my own fond memories associated with this album, as I listened to it a lot in the summers as a teen.  The songs just had a separate tranquility that really enhanced the mood of those isolated spots in the woods where my friends and I would hang out, having not much else to do in suburbia.  The vinyl version had a number of round holes cut out of the front cover, and the images you'd see in these holes would change as you turned the wheel that was set behind the cover.  The CD copies I've seen have the front cover and the backing wheel as two different flat scans. <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin's third album offers a diverse set of tunes, ranging from heavy metal to blue grass.  Yet it all miraculously flows together here.  I suppose it's a testament the fact that good, memorable song writing transcends any genre.
B000002UA5|3.0|UmmaGumma can of course be thought of as two separate albums... The first is a set of 4 live songs from previous albums, along with \\"Careful with that Axe Eugene\\".  For this song alone, the album is worth picking up. Additionally you receive a live version of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" that is interesting to compare to the original (Favorably in my opinion).  Other than bootlegs it's really the only way to experience what Pink Floyd sounded like live in their early days and is really enjoyable.  Now the second part of Ummagumma.  It's clear with this that Pink Floyd overestimated themselves,  and it's almost criminal that one is forced to buy a double album in order to get ALL the music on Ummagumma. Pink Floyd simply sounded like they were indulging themselves as progressive rockers a little too much. Still Ummagumma is worth picking up for the live songs.. and the interesting front cover...
B000002UR7|2.0|Not my cup of tea... Sure, it's got \\"Creep\\" (wich is still their biggest hit song to date i guess) and i like \\"You\\", but the rest of the cd isnt that great really. Ive listened to it a few times - and most songs i don't even remember. Before Bends came out the critics called Radiohead a \\"one day fly\\". I can understand why. Thank God the Bends came out a few years later...
0385513755|5.0|This book is very entertaining, with twists and turns at every page.  Each chapter ends on a high note, promising more thrills to come, which makes it all the more harder to put it down.  It is very addictive and this special edition, with the illustrations, simply brings the story to life.  All the references to art and religious history make the story richer and more compelling.  All in all, a great summer read.  Highly recommended.
0767827694|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies.  The music, cinematography, and acting is all very delightful.  Orlando is one of those movies that will stay in your DVD player for weeks.  The novel is fun, but the movie is spectacular.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UA2|4.0|\\"Obscured by clouds\\" is easily the most underrated Pink Floyd album.  It's most comparable to \\"More\\"  mainly because both were film scores, not concept albums, but to be blunt, Pink Floyd were simply better musicians, and much better songwriters by this point, just a couple of years after \\"More\\".  All of the songs are enjoyable,  and yet they still deliver that strage moody undertone to the whole album that in my opinion gives the band their signature sound
B00009ATKS|3.0|A strong album as a whole but when compared to other albums by Mogwai it falters slightly, although more experimental it points a direction more than takes you there. <br /> <br />\\"Hunted By A Freak\\" has the un-nerving beauty of what the title suggests, a voice distorted out of recognition by the use of a vocoder sings throughout and the focus I guess is more on melody and mood than actual lyrics... it would be interesting to find out just what the freak is saying. Starting with a faded in guitar melody the song builds with drums and bass coming in slowly followed by the un-earthly voice and then cello and a variety of other noises. A great way of opening the album. <br /> <br />\\"Moses? I Amn't\\" has a somber feel to it in the opening passages with synth organ and cello playing together a solemn melody as a guitar scratches and growls underneath. Leading us into an electronic empty and sparse beat as more strings join in, the static crackle of the beat changing the images in your head to a different place. But as soon as it started, it ends. <br /> <br />\\"Kids Will Be Skeletons\\" has guitar string noises playfully coming in and out of the main guitar melody as a string section, synth part and drums slowly build the song up to a newer guitar melody that gets built upon by more synths and then dies back into a quiet and long ending similar to the start, lulling you into a false sense of direction by cutting short the build up to bring it back down. <br /> <br />\\"Killing All The Flies\\" brings back the freak of the opening song. But this time to a melody that is touching with the use of strings as the vocal brings another mood to the songs on this album.  <br /> <br />\\"Boring Machines Disturbs Sleep\\" starts with what sounds like a wall of guitar feedback, but not the screeching variety. More the controlled variety, and with a vocal un-touched by vocoders the mood is more human and is almost a futuristic lullaby, if that sounds strange... I know! <br /> <br />\\"Ratts Of TheCapital\\" is the longest of the offerings on this album, clocking in at under 9 minutes and building the way a long Mogwai song does with simple clean guitar to a crescendo of noise and loud instruments, back down to a slow fade out with rumbling guitar underneath. In fact the ending of this song sounds very similar to the band \\"Explosions In The Sky\\"'s sound. <br /> <br />\\"Golden Porsche\\" is the shortest album track and one of the best too. Sublime in arrangement and instrumentation, without being self-indulgent and the song itself is simply beautiful. <br /> <br />The steady playing of a piano chord begins \\"I Know You Are But What Am I?\\" gently adding more piano onto the start until the electronica sound of synths and drum machines come into it and add an almost Kraftwerk feel to it, stopping and re-building again to do the same as the intro, an interesting song to listen to and play loud.  <br /> <br />\\"Stop Coming To My House\\" typical final song, building and building and building up then dropping off. Doesn't discredit it, but it's predictable. <br /> <br />Compared to previous albums this one is a 3 star rating as there are a couple of better Mogwai albums available.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Damon Albarn did good, real good, isn't it weird that it came out around the same time Oasis' latest album did?  Yeah, I love the album from beginning to end.  I've listened to it about seven or ten times and the gem of the album is still Feel Good Inc. Albarn could have taken over the world this summer if he pushed for one or two more chart toppers though.  It's one of the albums that'll remind you of how good the music was in summer 2K5, Beck's guerro, reznor's return w/ w/ teeth, the concept for jack whites get behind me satan.  I'm glad Albarn exists.
1400076943|5.0|I picked up this book about a month after discussing Chinua Achebe's novel \\"Things Fall Apart\\" with my book club. I had no idea that this book had deep roots in Achebe's great work, and was thrilled to discover the many connecting threads. While Achebe's work focuses primarily on one man, and offers a very male look at society, Adichie weaves a tale through the eyes of a shy teenage girl, Kambili, offering a complementary perspective. The book still revolves around a powerful man, who in some ways is similar to Achebe's main character, but who, instead of fighting for what he perceives to be \\"traditional ways\\", fights wiith equal passion and blindness on the side of the most domineering of the white missionaries. The men in both books try desperately not to be like their fathers. 'Purple Hibiscus' follows the progression of young Kambili, who has almost no identity or passion apart from her father, to a growing awareness about faith, tradition, family ties, and her own voice and beauty. I appreciated how the story gave examples of many different forms of belief in God, not pigeonholing believers or setting single stereotypes about missionaries. Adichie's book is complex, and invites a second read, after the first gripping, page-turning session. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to book clubs, after reading Chinua Achebe's \\"Things Fall Apart\\". While reading Achebe's book, I found very helpful a commentary edited by Isidore Okpewho called \\"Chinua Achebe's 'Things Fall Apart': A Casebook'\\". The essays and interviews in this book opened up the first novel for me and prepared me for many of the allusions in \\"Purple Hibiscus\\".  <br />
B000002U9Y|3.0|With \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" The Floyd carried on when they could have packed it in, and had to deal with the distraction of Barrett. Objectively it's really not that great of an album, arguably their worst (though my personal least favorite is the final cut). It's not that any of the songs are particularly bad...they each have their merits, but they were still finding their way as musicians, sounding a bit disjointed, the songs don't mesh together well, and some (Set the Controls comes to mind) tend to sound a little tedious.  But they got better...
B0002ZEYYQ|5.0|This album is a culmination of all 5 previous albums, as can be seen in many of their tracks. Their first single, \\"Feels Like It Should\\", is very reminiscent of their Synkronized album. The title track is easily the most addicting song on the album, much in the same fashion that \\"Love Foolosophy\\" was on Funk Odyssey.  The track \\"Seven Days In Sunny June\\" represents their earlier days, where synthesizers and digital sounds took a backseat to the natural beats and the piano and guitar rhythms that were abundant in \\"Return of The Space Cowboy\\".<br /><br />The entire ablum has a great flow, the tracks all seem to be where they should be; and blend together well to produce an album that you immediately want to restart and experience again. I got to the end of last track and realized it was over, and I had to go back to track one and listen to it again.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|Either the label or A7X themselves decided to move in a totally different direction.  Some of the songs have some ok material but its not much.  This album sounds like a wanna-be metal rock band from 15-20 years ago.  They had their own sound with Waking The Fallen. That album was very good.  They have tried to reinvent themselves -why? i dont know.  What I do know is that I will not be seing them live nor be wasting any further time with this album.  Incredible let down. Thats just my opinion and i am sure some of you will like it.  I hated it. HATED IT.  \m/ long live the metal underground
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|Yet another greatest hits collection from the queen of disco (there were 100 last count, LOL!!) but a great collection still.<br /><br />Beautiful sleeve photos (especially the beautiful Harry Langdon cover shot showing an ecstatic Donna) and great sleeve notes.<br /><br />The CD comprises 2 discs; The first comprising her Casablanca mega hits we all know and love, and the second, her latter, more experimental years. All songs are arranged chronologically, and are for the most part, the album versions, unlike other collections that truncate the hits.<br /><br />Disc one starts off with the hit that started it all, the million selling `Love to love you baby' (recently sampled by Beyonc&eacute;) that peaked at no.2 on the hot 100 and made the UK top 5 as well. Available here for the first time on CD in a long 4'58\\" minute edit which is the best I have heard.<br /><br />There's the ultimate version of `Could it be magic', the UK top 10 hits `Love's unkind', `I love you' (which also made the US top 40), the electronic perfection of `I feel love' (UK no.1, US no.6), the show stopping million selling, Grammy and Oscar winning `Last dance' which made it to no.3 on the hot 100, the million selling `MacArthur park' (US no.1 UK top 5), the million selling `Heaven knows' (US no.4 and recently covered by Faith Evans).<br /><br />Then we get to the multi million selling `Hot stuff' (US no.1, UK top 20) which won her a Grammy for best rock female (the first female to win). The multi million selling `Bad girls' (US no.1, UK top 20), the self penned million selling `Dim all the lights (US no.2), the million selling `On the radio' (US no.5) and the multi million selling `No more tears' (US no.1, UK no.3).<br /><br />Disc two opens with the synthesized rock of `The wanderer', a beautiful track that sold a million and made it to no.3 in the US. This was taken from the critically acclaimed foray into new wave 'The wanderer' (see my review of this classic album).<br /><br />`Love is in control', her foray into R&B, produced by Quincy Jones (US top 10, UK top 20). There's the epic, all star choir backed `State of independence' (UK top 20). Both feature on the excellent 'Donna Summer' album (see my review of this album).<br /><br />The driving rock/pop/dance ode to the working woman `She works hard for the money' (another gold disc, US no.3), the Caribbean laced `Unconditional love' (UK top 20).<br /><br />Her beautiful, synthesized remake of the drifters `There goes my baby' (US no.21) with it's great video (check it out on the DVD collection 20th Century masters: The best of Donna Summer).<br /><br />One of my absolute favourite Donna Summer songs is the fascinating `Dinner with Gershwin' (UK top 20) with its dazzling instrumentation, clunky beats and eclectic lyrics. Super!<br /><br />The trio of Stock Aitken Waterman produced hits; `This time I know it's for real' (another gold single, US no.7, UK no.3), `I don't want to get hurt (UK no.7), the vintage sounding `Loves about to change my heart' (UK top 20), the latter available here in the PWL mix with extra vocals.<br /><br />The R&B hit `When love cries' with cooing `Love to love you' style singing, sparse bass line, and Soul II soul beats. The version here is the 7\\" edit with a few extra vocals.  The Giorgio Moroder produced `Carry on' (which won the inaugural Grammy for best dance recording), `Melody of love', `I will go with you' (no one on else earth can hit that last note, LOL!!), the hi energy dance of `Dream-a-lots theme', and her most recent hit, the tribal synthesized trance of `You're so beautiful' (no. 5 billboard dance hit) available here for the first time in an edited version.<br /><br />I have followed Donna for years, and all through her experimenting which I thoroughly enjoyed (and which I think helped encourage my eclectic taste in music) and look forward to a new studio release with great anticipation. Donna Summer is one of the most gifted, powerful vocalists of all time (Isaw her live last year in London and she knocked all socks off), a trail blazer, and it is exciting wondering just where she will lead us to next...ust where she will lead us to next...
B000000WJZ|5.0|I own all the smashing pumpkins albums and this one is definitely their best, although \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" does come close. Every song on this album is excellent I can listen to it from beginning to end every time. Favorites are, Today, Soma, Geek U.S.A, and Rocket. Buy this Album you won't regret it.
0380789019|5.0|What an amazing read. From the minute you pick this book up YOU will not want to put it down. An outstanding plot with twists and turns from beginning to end. The characters are alive and vibrant. The fantasy world created here is astonishing. How London and above and London below contradict each other yet seemingly intertwine with one another is incredible. A must read. Trust me!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Diane Keaton walks away with this movie.....\\"pants down\\" (literaly). I counted 69 actors and actresses and other than Jack (who is always memorable) you will never forget Diane Keaton in this role.....she owns it! Talk about taking a risk as an actress. I mean she goes almost completely nude at an age when Hollywood (of all people) forbids such behaviour as being \\"uncommercial\\". But besides her beautiful body (even in her late fifties) Diane finaly puts to rest all those walk through performances of her past. You know the ones; Reds, Mrs. Soffel, The Lemon Sisters, Sleeper, Father of the Bride's, etc. In this movie it's all about Diane and she absolutely shines and proves why she has survived after all these years as a talent. She is simply spectacular and must be seen. Imagine me.....in my late fifties.....enfactuated with a woman in her late fifties (Diane). I have to ask.....Is there something wrong with me? Can this be normal? Shouldn't I be consumed with a Lindsay, Brittany, or Jessica or whatever their young names are? Hugh? NO WAY! I wouldn't trade my new found fantasy for Diane for all the bulimic and anorexic twenty year old actresses in all of Hollywood. Diane.....you had me from hello!
6303203345|4.0|This is one of my favourite Arnie movies. Set in the future Arnie is a soldier who refuses to open fire on a crowed of innocent civilians as ordered by his commander... he is knocked out and put into rehabilitation (slave jail) and is framed by the army who tell the public it was his idea to kill the innocent crowed, giving him the nickname, \\"the butcher of Bakersfield\\" <br /> <br />18 months later he is with a group in the prison who have worked on a plan to escape... they do so, and become fugitives. Meanwhile a reality game show on TV called the Running man will do anything for ratings, and when Arnie makes the news for trying to get out of the country, the host of the show wants Arnie on his game show. The running man is the name of the show and it's a game where they send the runners out into a field and then send stalkers after them.  <br /> <br />Along the way is action, suspense, comedy and fun. It's a battle of survival and there running for there life from guys that look like something from the World Wrestling Federation.  <br /> <br />A great action movie, if you haven't seen it, give it a rent.. Apparently the Special Edition on DVD isn't worth bothering with, so I'll stick with the VHS for now. <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Okay, ya, this movie doesn't have a plot. The characters remind me of the less fortunate kids from junior high and Napoleon repeats the word \\"idiot\\" a lot. But come on you harsh critics out there. It's just a \\"freakin\\" movie. Lucas or Spielberg didn't create it. This is just a fun movie. The accompanying soundtrack is very good as well. The movie and soundtrack has that 80's vibe to it so maybe that's what I adore so much about it. The 80's were fun and in retrospect so were those geeks back in junior high that everyone made fun of (not that it's right to make fun of geeks). Anyway this movie has sold well and is still selling out at the local movie stores along with the vast number of Napoleon movie collectibles. If you were into the cheesy 80's movies like The Breakfast Club or Weird Science, you'll probably dig this one.
B00080Z53O|5.0|If you were told that this story was about a quadriplegic that wants to end his life and the people who want to help or hinder him, you'd probably turn away.  But this film is inspiring and life affirming without melodrama or cheesy dialogue.  Based on a true story of a Spaniard who has been disabled since a neck injury 30 years prior, Ramon Sampedro (played to perfection by Javier Bardem from \\"When Night Falls\\") embarks upon a political journey to end his life legally.  Ramon is surrounded by three strong women (his mother, a lover `wanna-be' and a  journalist) and a loving family.  His insights are thoughtful and beautiful, with director Alejandro Amenabar (\\"The Others\\", \\"Permanent Midnight\\"), flashing a fantastic style ranging from heartfelt close-ups to wild flying scenes against the backdrop of the Spanish countryside and seaside.  Whether one agrees with Ramon's decision is irrelevant to the story, as it is all about celebrating life.  The truly human dialogue backed with brilliantly subtle cinematography is refreshing.  The only drawback is the ending - not that you guess what happens, but because the film is over and so is the life it so beautifully portrays.
B000002KIE|3.0|I don't deny that this is deffinantly an influential album, and its awesome for when you are pumped up or just in the mood for it.  It's a solid album all in all, and if you're looking for balls to the wall punk, then I'd say this is a 5 star CD.  However, I though musicly a lot of the songs were very similar, and eventually just get to be an annoying ringing in your head, which is why I docked it two stars.  (but really, stars are givin away way to sparingly, three stars means AVARAGE, but whenever anyone sees it now, they think it means bad.)
B00095MLGC|5.0|Going by the listed release date of June 21, 2005, I'm assuming this listing is for the reissue of the 1993 album.  I just received the reissue as an import from England.  It's got a bonus CD, that being the \\"Staircase Infinites\\" release from 1994.  The reissue 2-CD set was going to be available in America too, just not as soon, that's why I ordered the import.<br /><br />The reissue also has been re-recorded.  Specifically, the current drummer Harrison has laid down real drum tracks to replace the programmed \\"drums\\" that were on the original release.  Steven Wilson has also re-recorded some of the guitar parts, but only in a very minor way, i.e. some of the softer acoustic melodies.  He's also remastered it of course.<br /><br />So the original feel of the album is the same.  However, it's nice to hear the tracks with real drums.  I was okay with the original release, I thought Wilson had been masterful with his drum programming, and the songs were great.  Up The Downstair was always my favorite studio album of PT.  The real drums do add a new dimension though.  On first listen, I wish Wilson had left the acoustic guitars alone, but it's not a major issue.<br /><br />In 1993, Wilson just starting to transition PT from a solo project into a band.  Richard Barbieri contributes keys on one song, Colin Edwin contibutes bass on one song.  Barbieri's wife contributes vocals on one song.  The rest was all Wilson (though long-distance collaborator Alan Duffy supplied lyrics for several of the songs).<br /><br />This material has a heavy Pink Floyd influence, though there's also plenty of influence from hard-rock and techno/dance.  All done in a creative and progressive way (without being technical).  The songs are brooding and atmospheric.  There are several instrumentals.  Lots of great lead guitar and dreamy synths.  Vocals are muted and almost seem a mere afterthought, though that is perfect for the songs.<br /><br />Staircase Infinities had some songs leftover from the Up The Downstair sessions (Wilson's intent was for UTD to be a double album), plus Wilson recorded a couple new pieces, one of those being a re-working of a track from the cassette days.  There are only 5 tracks total, about 30 minutes.  Very good stuff though, similar in style to Up The Downstair.<br /><br />Though all of this is quite different from current Porcupine Tree, it's still great music and gets my highest recommendation.ver from the Up The Downstair sessions (Wilson's intent was for UTD to be a double album), plus Wilson recorded a couple new pieces, one of those being a re-working of a track from the cassette days.

B00008PX8P|5.0|A great Live DVD, has most of the essentiel zeppelin songs and has quite a bit of extras but still they could have done much better. I mean c'mon there are soo many songs that are missing that its not even funny. Maybe they couldnt find any live versions of the songs but if I was in charge of making this DVD I woulda surely added the following songs to the list. <br /> <br />Good Times Bad Times, Thank You, Heartbreaker, Ramble On, A quality version of The Immigrant Song because the one on their now is terrible, Gallows Pole, The Battle Of Evermore, When The Levee Breaks, The Song Remains The Same, Over The Hills And Far Away, Dancing Days, No Quarter, Houses Of The Holy, and Ten Years Gone.
076790382X|5.0|Finish another one of Bill Bryson's books. Full of witty imagination and great reading experience.  <br /> <br />The message I got from this book is: there are plenty of unsatisfying things in life that you can be cynical about, but still you will love living (in) it.  <br /> <br />Of course some people don't like (tolerant) being made fun of (with goodwill), even Americans. So they accused of this book not telling the truth, which I would argue that it contains more than most of the printed material, even with Bill's cartoonish exaggeration. <br /> <br />That reminded me of a Chinese writer Qian Zhongshu. His novel \\"Fortress Besieged\\" carried this kind of witty cynical flavor about Chinese society of that (all) times (1930's). I heard that \\"Fortress Besieged\\" was on the forbidden list by the Chinese government of that time.  <br /> <br />Since he is also American, Bill Bryson wouldn't be in trouble because of this book, I hope :)
B00005JNJT|5.0|I'd heard good things about the movie before I went to see it, so I was enthusiastic about seeing the movie.  I was willing to give Christian Bale the benefit of the doubt because I hadn't seen him do very much of anything.  Bale had his work cut out for him-Michael Keaton, IMHO, was the best live-action Batman to hit the big screen, and Bale had to at least equal Keaton's intensity in order to earn my respect. <br /> <br />The good news is, Bale makes the cut.  The great news is, this is by far the best live-action Batman movie in existence!  This was a big bang, folks-a total regeneration.  It invites you to throw out every previous impression of Batman that you've seen live-action and embrace a \\"new Batman order\\".     Christian Bale brings the character of billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne to the next level, a level consistent with the characterizations aptly portrayed in the better Batman cartoons that are on television.  And I would be remiss in my duties if I didn't acknowledge that stellar supporting cast-gadgetman Morgan Freeman and the affable Michael Caine as Alfred.  Someone had to have some serious connections in Tinseltown to make that happen!  And who is this newcomer, Cillian Murphy?  I was frightened...he was fantastic!  And Liam Neeson, big Irish brute that he is, playing the self-righteous, but no less dangerous, villian.  I was in awe! <br /> <br />If I were to change anything about the movie, I would have ditched Katie Holmes as a love interest.  Frankly, for a movie that scored the way this one does, it required a babe of the Kim Basinger caliber, and Holmes does not make the cut.  She's got age and naturally occurring collagen on Ms. Basinger, and little else.   <br /> <br />Overall, I rate this movie 5 stars, and give it the highest possible recommendation.  I am suitably gratified. <br />
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|While nearly everyone we used to know as Queens of the Stone Age has left, the musical integrity remains the same. Anyone who critisizes this album by saying it isn't as good as the others or that it's a sellout must just have expected the band to release another Songs for the Deaf. Unfortunately, this album goes down a new path and therefore has a different identity to the others, but then again, that's what QOTSA are good for - they embody all kinds of rock - from grunge to metal to punk. Sure Nick and Josh were brilliant together but Josh's new offering is every bit as good as any of the other albums. While the past albums have had a uniquely gritty sound this one moves slightly away from this yet still remains as dark. Perhaps the music is just getting cleaner?... It's obvious that QOTSA's music has changed dramtically with every album so I suppose this album should come as no suprise to the truer fans. Anyway, point is, this is a CD worth buying and certainly worth listening to!
B00005JNJT|3.0|Easily the darkest version of Batman thus far. <br /> <br />And it takes the cake when it comes to scares. What were the BBFC (UK Censor Board) thinking with the \\"12A\\" rating? This qualifies for a \\"15\\". Head-buts, kicks, bones breaking, faces becoming twisted and contorted, demons taking shape, etc. Gothic stuff indeed! <br /> <br />However, I have a horrible feeling the film has been cut. There were a number of sudden cuts and these edits looked very ropey...   <br /> <br />As a film, it's a vast improvement on the farcical sequels of Tim Burton's original. However, some of the designs are rather weak - the costume remains a rubber-suit. Why-oh-why couldn't they use the type of design seen in the live-action short film - Batman: Dead End? <br /> <br />The performances are spirited, the film has a punchy pace and the music is sweeping and graceful. <br /> <br />However, after 140mins, I felt empty and unfulfilled. <br /> <br />It was good but it lacked the zest and passion of the comic-books.
B0002IU988|5.0|Whoever gives this album less than five stars having been able to hear it on here first and then buy is without a brain! It's really that simple, see, Alter Bridge is way better than Creed (due to a mentally progressed Mark Tremonti and a much better vocalist), and I loved Creed, too.  <br /> <br />So here we are with One Day Remains and I truly hope that that's the amount of time left to wait for their NEXT album, because this stuff is truly amazing. <br /> <br />Those without taste, I think I hear the Backstreet Boys calling...
B00005JNTX|5.0|Okay, I've seen it (and got the T-Shirt) and here's my initial words on the topic... I've tried to keep it brief. <br /> <br />I had very low expectations due to some of the casting and the Digital-Video shoot. However, after seeing the evidence, many of my misgivings have been swept away. Read on... <br /> <br />This is easily the best use of SFX and CGI in quite some time. STAR WARS III pales away into insignificance due to the effects swamping the story and dwarfing the characters. In SIN CITY, all the special effects are there to service the plot and characters and this blending is so seamless that one easily forgets that you're watching SFX, instead you focus in on the story and become completely absorbed by the population that resides in the hard-boiled streets of SIN CITY. <br /> <br />The Noir style of the film, with all those jagged jaws, tough women and blood splattered corpses, makes this film the most visually arresting of the last few years. It really has pushed the envelope in what can now be done to illustrate a story and create a credible world for the characters to inhabit it. Absolutely magnificent imagination at work here and all the artists should be commended for giving us such a vivid creation. This is easily the best comic-book adaptation ever committed to celluloid. <br /> <br />And what a gargantuan task it must have been for Frank Miller to adapt most of his novels into one cohesive story! He makes the art of script-writing seem so easy. Other writers should take note and follow in his footsteps. Anyone who saw the recent film THE JACKET knows what I'm talking about here. <br /> <br />The performances are very convincing and no one actor overshadows the others. This ensemble piece is spellbinding and, once again, is there to showcase the diverse stories rather than glorifying individual characters. This allows us to become immersed in the world of SIN CITY and watch, almost like a fly which spies from a wall, the different people as their paths criss-cross the bars and alleys of the rat infested city. <br /> <br />The music and soundstage is also carefully tailored to bring out the best details and deliver realistic sounds of a city losing it's soul. Robert Rodriguez delivers a pulpy music track that blends smoky Jazz, salty Brass and the thumping electricity of glass being cracked with bare feet. Bullets buzz like wasps and knifes slice the air in vindictive whooshes that scratch eyeballs. <br /> <br />Tarantino, Miller and Rodriguez have given film connoisseurs a movie that will tickle their taste-buds. They have shown great innovation and new areas have been ploughed for future generations to mine and explore. <br /> <br />SIN CITY is a landmark film that deserves to be seen on the big screen, it oozes class and style and will give you old fashioned entertainment. Stinky juveniles should stay well away and allow adults to savour this Pulp-Noir. <br /> <br />Okay, I'll shut up for now... <br /> <br />Recommended. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is the best album I've purchased this year. I would recommend this CD to anyone that really loves great Pop/Rock music. I love every single song. Favorites: \\"White Shadows\\" and \\"Twisted Logic.\\"
B0000039QA|4.0|Some of the tracks in Life After Death are good, but that's as far as it goes. Biggie's voice didn't seem to have that raw energy it did in Ready to Die. This album didn't hold that much volume of what Biggie was about and it featured to many collaberations. I gave it a 4 star rating simply because Biggie never sounded this good since Ready to Die.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|Picture Saddam Hussein in a psychiatric session with Dr. Phil. Such is the image of heavy metal monster, Metallica, hiring a prominent psychiatrist-of-sorts to remedy their internal conflicts during the making of the \\"St. Anger\\" album. This is really one long unintentionally funny group therapy session, with the macho Metallica reduced to bratty siblings tattling on each other to mommy. It's a wonder these guys ever make it through a day. The psychiatrist, who remains with the band through the years it took to make \\"St Anger\\", is about the most un-Metallica like square you could ever imagine, sporting a mall bought knit sweater, and hush-puppies no doubt, looking like somebody's Dad from a 1960s sitcom, mouthing broad bland strokes of psychiatric wisdom which is sometimes heard as nothing short of profound from the members of Metallica. Later in the film, when Metallica determines he is no longer needed and too expensive anyway, and the psychiatrist himself is apparently making plans to become an unofficial fourth member of Metallica, as maybe some former band members can attest, he is given the boot. Chewed up and spat out. And the poor guy doesn't get it. He has a mental block. He can't comprehend getting fired. I thought he was going to start begging - \\"I'll do anything -I'll sweep the floors - I'll carry the amps!\\" You can hear frontman James Hetfield murmer something under his breath to the effect of, \\"See you later, chump.\\" It was a bit reassuring to see Metallica bully somebody around, and this documentary reveals Metallica in all their flawed human glory. They're just your typical multi-millionaires with problems just like the rest of us. When drummer Lars Ulrich decides to part with his art collection of famous paintings, he is conflicted. He loves the paintings but decides he wants to share them with others. A museum or gallery doesn't leap to mind, but a public auction does, and he is rewarded with millions and millions of dollars in profit. Boy, can I relate. It was just the other day I was looking at my original Van Gogh on the wall, thinking, you know, I'm getting so bored with that picture ... By the time the work is done and Metallica steps on stage to reveal \\"St. Anger\\" to the world, you have to believe that you have witnessed the process that resulted in the fine music. I like these guys even more than I did before seeing the film. It takes courage to reveal to the world that you're just a bunch of jerks. The striking tinted color cinematography during concert scenes looked like a neo-youth for Hitler rally nightmare. Seas of flesh saluting praise to Metallica. The editing and sound of the film is superb. It has to be the first rock and roll documentary I've seen, where, as far as I can recall, not one cigareette was lit.late.

B00000JCB2|5.0|Okay, one thing I really don't understand is why this band is hated so much. Alot of people complain about Fred Durst's singing, screaming, and rapping. But aside from the vocals,  music-wise and musically, what makes Limp Bizkit so differnt from the rest of the bands in Limp Bizkit's same time era or same Nu Metal or Rap Metal rock genre like Linkin Park, Staind, Disturbed, Ra, Drowning Pool, Puddle Of Mudd, Korn, and Static-X? I seriously don't see anything wrong with this band, or why they're always the cruel joke of music humor. And wow, do I really miss the 90's...where this band was more popular and respected, or before Kurt Cobain from Nirvana killed himself, or when all the rock music radio stations played better rock music back then than all the garbage they play now. I've had this album since I was 10 years old, and I've always liked it, and I seriously do not know why this band is so disrepected. My favorite songs are Nookie, Break Stuff, Re-arranged, Nobody like you, and No Sex. But yeah, this is a pretty good album. I noticed the reason why everyone disrespcets Limp Bizkit is mainly because of Fred Durst's screaming, but seroiusly, he screams like anyone else out there, just listen to this album. I also suggest checking out the album \\"The Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" as well. Later, everyone.
B000002MZ9|5.0|Cuando escuche que Pearl jam, tal vez una de las bandas que mas ha recibido la influencia de Neil Young, sobre todo en el catalogo electrico, se disponia a colaborar como banda de acompa&ntilde;amiento del viejo para un disco en el a&ntilde;o 95, muchas cosas llegaron a mi mente.<br /><br />Primero, si el disco de Neil sonaria a Pearl Jam, o Pearl jam sonaria a los Horsemen. Segundo, en adelante iba a ser Pearl jam la banda soporte de Neil?. Tercero como iba a hacer ese encuentro vocal doble entre Eddy Vedder y Neil Young, dado sus sistintos timbres de voz.<br /><br />Bueno, de a poco mis dudas fueron siendo despejadas....<br /><br />El disco se realizo en el ultimo a&ntilde;o de apogeo Seattle (95) despues de la muerte de Kurt, y en el que muchas bandas de esa ciudad comenzaron a perder fuerza de conjunto, y su sonido lentamente iba desapareciendo de las emisoras. Con este disco, Neil simplemente se reafirmo como el abuelo del grunge, e identidad principal de la musica de estos chicos de Seattle.<br /><br />El sonido del disco, aunque los acordes y el estilo son del viejo Neil (con un poco de influencia grunge), es oscuro, fuerte (por las 3 guitarras), y trata de priorizar lo musical sobre lo vocal (de ahi a que las voces no sobrepasen las guitarras).<br /><br />El disco es de igual manera el fin de un a&ntilde;o de gira conjunta entre Neil y pearl jam, y una manera de memorizar aquella genial quimica dentro del escenario, cuando estos chicos intrepretaban los clasicos del viejo.<br /><br />Las canciones son excelentes, cargadas de una fuerza instrumental unica, tan buena como un buen disco con los Horsemen. Las liricas tratan basicamente aspectos sociales y nostalgicos (downtown y scinery), buenos solos y excelente, aunque para mi sorpresiva, las intrepretaciones de Jack irons en la bateria (tal vez el que mejor capto la idea de la quimica con el viejo) P.D. Lo siento Ralf pero el tipo estuvo genial, a pesar de no ser un baterista muy tecnico.<br /><br />No creo que ningun fan del Neil electrico o de Pearl jam, no vaya a gustarle el disco; tal vez su unico defecto es la poca participacion de Vedder (unicamente aparece en un solo tema como cantante principal, en el resto del disco hace solo coros), un excelente vocalista, que debio ser aprovechado para cantar algunos temas mas, y participar en duos con el viejo.<br /><br />En definitiva, esta es otra aventura mas del viejo, con nuevos superamigos en la retaguardia, pero fiel a su estilo de musico errante y de no encasillarse en un solo estilo.<br /><br />Disfrutenlo...es un buen discoarle el disco; tal vez su unico defecto es la poca participacion de Vedder (unicamente aparece en un solo tema como cantante principal, en el resto del disco hace solo coros), un excelente vocalista, que debio ser aprovechado para cantar algunos temas mas, y participar en duos con el viejo. <br />En definitiva, esta es otra aventura mas del viejo, con nuevos superamigos en la retaguardia, pero fiel a su estilo de musico errante y de no encasillarse en un solo estilo. <br />Disfrutenlo...es un buen disco
B0009I7NNA|3.0|The first A7X that I ever heard was their album \\"Waking the Fallen,\\" and it completely hooked me.  Because of Waking the Fallen, to me, A7X is all about the synchronized, catchy, memorable guitar lines and again, the memorable vocals.  In particular, I'm thinking about \\"I've come here to kill you, won't leave until you die...\\" and stuff like that.  As far as the guitar goes, the intro to Unholy Confessions is what I'm referring to. <br /> <br />So. <br /> <br />City of Evil isn't \\"bad\\" but to me, it isn't really Avenged Sevenfold.  No screaming, well, I can get past that, but it seems to lack the overall cohesion that bound Waking the Fallen together.  There's just something lacking... nothing wrong with it musically, but in my opinion, it isn't as good as the previous albums.
B0000033RY|5.0|On the bad side of things, you are thirty pounds heavier than you were in high school and have once or twice found yourself wondering how long it will be, if you are a male, before you need Viagara. <br /> <br />On the good side of things, realizing most contemporary popular music sucks, you have some money now and are buying on CD some of those albums you remember from the 60's and 70's as being so good.  If you liked Cactus in the early 70's, this one is a good gamble.  The playing is as energetic as you remember and the sound of this CD is really good, even on your crappy old stereo with the twenty pound speakers.  So give this one a try if you want to relive some raw, kick-ass rock and roll.  I bet you will like it.  If not, keep on trying.   The music then really was better than the music of today.
B000957O82|4.0|\\"Hitch\\", Will Hitchens', clients are the bottom of the barrel as far as date material. These men pay the oh-so-cool Hitch to teach them how to capture the hearts of women.  Hitch is good at it, too, an impressive number of his clients have gotten 'hitched' to the ladies of their dreams.  <br /> <br />What happens when Hitch himself falls in love?  The man certainly needs help--but more than anything he needs to learn how to be himself to impress his lady.   <br /> <br />\\"Hitch\\" is a good afternoon's fun and definitely worth watching.
B000002KDI|4.0|Originally a double LP, \\"Live Rust\\" is divided about equally between acoustic numbers and electric rock n' roll, and while it doesn't quite match the searing power of \\"Weld\\", \\"Live Rust\\" is both an excellent live album and a fine career summary, including older material as well as then-new songs. <br /> <br />\\"Sugar Mountain\\", \\"Hey Hey, My My\\", a great rendition of \\"The Needle And The Damage Done\\", the awesome eight-minute \\"Like A Hurricane\\", and the ballad \\"When You Dance I Can Really Love\\" are all among the highlights. And Neil Young plays some smouldering guitar...he really is an underrated lead guitarist. <br />There is a lot of variation here in both tempo and mood, and the sound is very good, too. Neil Young rarely strays too far from the original arrangements, but several songs do pack a little more punch than the studio versions. <br /> <br />There are many highlights on this album and very few low points, but the single greatest song on \\"Live Rust\\" has to be the magnificent rocker \\"Powderfinger\\", one of Neil Young's best, most vivid and most evocative electric rock songs. <br />This one epic song is pure, incendiary rock n' roll, and even if the rest of the album had been completely worthless, \\"Powderfinger\\" alone would have been worth the price of admission. <br />4 1/2 stars.

B000002UC5|4.0|A lot of Beatles fans can recite the negative reviews of this one by heart.  But the most common complaint is that it sounds incomplete.  And it does, compared to most of his other work - but in a way, that's the point.<br /><br />There are no songs here about falling out with your three best friends while the whole world watches, or being a millionaire who suddenly finds himself broke, or watching the tabloid media vilify your wife - but those were the circumstances McCartney was living through when he wrote and recorded these songs.  It's that kind of album, even if the words and music don't say so directly.  It's perfect for those rainy afternoons when you just have to retreat from the world to your safe place and do what makes you happiest.  For Paul, that meant making simple songs in his living room in Scotland, away from the press and the music business.  It might have been a difficult time for him, but it had a happy ending:  he's never put out anything as intimate or direct before or since, solo or otherwise.<br /><br />And those \\"unfinished\\" songs?  Some fans think they just say their piece very economically.  \\"That Lovely Linda,\\" \\"That Would Be Something,\\" and \\"Man We Was Lonely\\" all have few words beyond the title lines, but that's all they really have to say, and they do all have a unique feel to them.  \\"Every Night\\" and \\"Teddy Boy\\" are more developed lyrically, but the delivery is still wonderfully raw and direct on both.  \\"Junk\\" is the album's most opaque number, but also its most beautiful, with a melody that reminds me of his White Album ballads.  \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is the only fully-developed song on the album, and slightly out of place for that reason.  But it is one of his best, not at all silly, love songs.<br /><br />Most of the other songs are instrumental or semi-instrumental, with some oohs and ahs here and there.  In keeping with the rustic style, at one point you can hear Linda opening the kitchen door if you know where to listen.  These might be boring if they comprised the whole album, but they sound great interspersed among the vocal songs.<br /><br />Self indulgent?  Perhaps a bit, but it works.ese might be boring if they comprised the whole album, but they sound great interspersed among the vocal songs. <br /> <br />Self indulgent?  Perhaps a bit, but it works.
0670033375|5.0|Collapse is somehow the counterpart of Guns, Germs, and Steele, where Diamond discussed the rise of human complex societies. In Collapse he discusses how these complex societies come to an end. The basic message is two-fold: 1) at present we live in a globalized society at risk of global collapse due to environmental deterioration and 2) this global collapse can be avoided if we react properly against these problems. <br /> <br />Five are the factors that Diamond suggests to explain the collapse of societies: 1) environmental deterioration due to misuse of natural resources; 2) changes in climate; 3) antagonistic behavior from rival societies; 4) changes in the relationships with trade allies; and 5) the way that members of a society at risk of collapse react in order to change maladaptive cultural behaviors under new conditions. One society can collapse from any of the four first factors, but frequently several of them act together. One of the points that Diamond makes is that complex societies collapse rather suddenly, and in moments not far from their period of maximum splendor, for the surprise of the own society's members. <br /> <br />The book is divided in four parts. In the first one Diamond uses Montana, a nature-rich State in the USA as an example of the general trends in the world: problems with water, changes associated to global warming, overpopulation, bad forest management, invasive species, social conflicts, and so on so on. As a non-American Montana didn't bring me any strong image, and I felt the chapter quite dull, though I had no problem to follow Diamond's points and intentions. <br /> <br />The second part focuses on past societies that have collapsed. This is the best part of the book, mainly the chapters dedicated to Pacific islands like Easter and the Pitcairn archipelago. Those historical reconstructions of the processes followed in small-scale societies, from their first colonization, to the increase of population and final debacles are fantastic. Those chapters are beautiful and inspiring; my brain was very active during the time I read them. My feelings were quite ambiguous: on the one hand I felt deep admiration of the human ability to colonize and adapt to new environments, but on the other I felt sad to see how one single species (we) has succeed till the point of putting itself always in risk, as well as other species. We will never know how wonderful were all these places (Pacific islands, remote areas, initially human-free continents) before the arrival of a few human individuals. Other examples of historical collapses are the Anazasi, Maya, Norses in Geenland, and others.  <br /> <br />The third part turns to the present and discusses contemporary societies collapses. Again this part begins with wonderful, but sad, chapters. First of all the tragedy of Rwanda 1994. Rwandese people killed each other in a dramatic civil war, which Diamond relates to overpopulation and depletion of natural resources in the small country (the idea is not original from him though). You will be frozen while reading this chapter, but at the same time you will be willing to know more and more about such a cruel episode. One more time (like in The Third Chimpanzee) Diamond is at his best while describing genocide. After that a comparison between conditions at the both sides of La Hispaniola. Puerto Rico and Haiti share a common physical environment, but have differed much on their history, politics, economy, etc. I didn't know much about Balaguer, the long time dictator in Puerto Rico, but his figure resulted interesting as Diamond explained his ambiguous policies: a cruel tyrant who seemed to have a deep concern for protecting his country's natural resources. A despotic conservationist. Diamond takes good care not to be misunderstood as a supporter of Balaguer policies. Other examples of present societies that are at risk because of ecological deterioration are China and Australia. Important... but a bit boring. <br/> <br />The final chapter is a synthesis and a discussion of what can be done (the practical lessons). They are supposed to be the most important chapters, but again are not the most interesting. Why do some societies make disastrous decision? What is the role to be played by the big companies in our relation with the environment? And, the present global world. I especially liked his reasoning regarding the capacity to perceive problems, and how the size of the society influences the capacity of members to have an integrated vision: in a small island all inhabitants are able to see changes in the environment, in a highly hierarchical society a few decision-makers can dictate suitable policies, but in fragmented middle-size societies decision is too individual and environmental deterioration is difficult to track by individuals. The relation between big business and conservation is fundamental, and the influence that general public (consumers) can exert on companies' policies. But honestly, I didn't finish the chapter (too many details, too boring). Finally the relation of the present global problems is quite correct: destroy of natural resources, ceilings (in the amount of energy, freshwater or photosynthetic capacity that we will be able to use as our demands continue to increase), harmful products (toxics, alien species,...), human overpopulation (both growth and per capita environmental impact). It will be impossible to maintain these trends, and continue to increase the impact on the environment result of present consumerisms values. The final conclusion is that the solutions to stop these trends are already available but we need a change in social values and the political will to apply these solutions.  <br /> <br />Well, the conclusion is not new. It is quite a generally accepted one among the scientific community. But it is good to read an influential American author stressing the importance of individual commitment with politics to solve our global problems. Personally I am less optimistic than Diamond. I agree that we have problems to understand large-scale phenomena, and we are driven by proximate small-scale objectives rather than long term world-scale ones. Furthermore, when I hear about \\"sustainable policies\\" I cannot avoid thinking in terms of Game Theory. Sustainable policies depend on most of the members of society behaving in a way that benefits them or others not in a short term but in a mid long-term. However, human been seeks personal short-term benefits. Any \\"long-term oriented\\" society is very vulnerable to invasion from selfish \\"short-term oriented\\" individuals. When individuals making sacrifices for the \\"good of the group\\" observe such selfish individuals, and see them prospering, they will shift the behavior to the selfish type. Sustainable policies are not and ESS (evolutionary stable strategy). The only way to make sustainable policies successful is to make them rewarding in the short-term for individuals performing them. We will have to think how we can do this... and do it on time! <br /> <br />As a final comment. The book is too long (like my review). This means not only that you will need too many hours to read it, but even that it is too big and heavy to be carried to many places, and therefore cannot be read while moving on the train, bus, etc... as I usually do. <br /> <br />Books like collapse should be a must in the education of new generations. I would make it an obligate reading at high schools.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|It takes a special kind of person to be able to mix the right amount of plot driven social commentary with the high gore factor of a zombie movie. George Romero is that special kind of person. It doesn't take long for you to get to know and relate with the characters in this movie. You quickly grow sympathetic for them and actually care if something happens to them. You don't see that alot in movies these days. In some ways, if you try really hard, you can even picture how you would react in the character's situations and you may even notice that the way you react and the way the characters react are about the same. If you are looking for a movie with a deep storyline with outstanding character development, this is the movie for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for your basic blood and guts, zombie filled gorefest... this is also the movie for you. Enjoy!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I was skeptical about Mariah's new album until I heard her sing \\"We Belong Together\\" in Letterman. All the time my mouth was hanging open and I could not breath. Mariah looked so beautiful and the song was a breath taker. Then I decided to shell out my money and went to Target to get the CD on the first day of release, the thing I had never done before. And to tell the truth, I was not dissapointed at all. The tracks in the CD are very personal, especially the ballads that she sings. It was deep to hear Mariah sing \\"We Belong Together\\" especially if you're in or out of love. It's like she's talking about you or to you. Other great tracks are \\"It's like that\\", \\"Get your number\\", \\"Circles\\", \\"Your girl\\", and \\"Fly like a bird\\" which is very inspirational to me. For other songs I would get tired after hearing for about 2 or 3 straight days but \\"Mimi\\" has been in the CD player in my car for a while.  <br />Personally I think \\"Mimi\\" is a success because Mariah felt happier in her life, after all those troubles she got from Sony and her ex-husband. The photographs in her CD shows it all. Just compare her frustrated face on the cover of \\"Charmbracelet\\" and the proud and glowy one on \\"Mimi\\". It does not take an expert to tell how a woman feels. I'm so glad for her that she finally puts herself together. <br />To all those haters: I'm not a music executive, I'm a poor student who having a CD is a luxury. And I bought Mariah's \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" because it is undeniably good!

B00005K9LM|5.0|So you saw Judas Priest at Ozzfest 2004 and liked their performance, now you want to start buying their back catalog. If so, \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" is a great place to start. This album, originally released in 1984, came out in between two very different Priest releases: 1982's \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\", which was an awesome, classic sounding heavy metal album, and \\"Turbo\\", released in 1986, which was an intentionally commercial-sounding pop-metal album. The result is \\"Defenders of the Faith\\", a heavy album with great hooks. It might not have the world's greatest production, but that's part of it's charm. Released in january 1984, the album broke the Billboard top 20 in less than a week. Here's a track-by-track overview:    1.Freewheel Burning - A great fast-paced opener. Classic Halford screams and Tipton/Downing dual leads abound. 9/10.    2.Jawbreaker - Another speedy rocker. Not the best, but not all too memorable, either. 7/10.    3.Rock Hard, Ride Free - This is where the album really kicks into gear. Hard rockin' verses and an insanely catchy chorus. One of my all time favorite JP tracks. 10/10.    4.The Sentinel - Overrated. Still a good track, but way too many people claim that this is the albums best track when it is not. 7.5/10.    5.Love Bites - The single for this album, nowhere near as powerful as their previous albums singles: Breakin' the Law(British Steel) or You've Got Another thing Comin' (Screaming for Vengeance), but I like it. Great Ian Hill bass intro 8/10.    6.Eat me Alive - This is one the PMRC's notorious \\"Filthy Fifteen\\", good, catchy, fast-paced rocker.Keeps it simple. 8/10.    7.Some Heads are gonna Roll - My second favorite off of the album. Catchy hair metal-sounding track. Almost has a Dokken-type feel. judas Priest does this style well. 10/10.    8.Night Comes Down - A classic! My personal favorite. The intro has a slow, jazzy fell and it transforms into a great catchy mid-paced rock song. Good lyrics, good musicianship, it just works! 10/10.    9.Heavy Duty - Not that great. Filler track. 5/10.    10.Defenders of the Faith - See \\"Heavy Duty\\". 5/10                        BONUS TRACKS!  11.Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith (live)- Horrible choice! the worst two songs on the album played live. Echh! 0/10.    12.Turn on your Light - Crappy ballad. Another bad bonus track choice. 6/10.      All in all, it might not have their strongest individual songs, but as an album, it is diverse enough and works together well enough to be considered Judas Priest's finest album. Thank you.
B00003CXCT|3.0|At some point, it would be nice to have the original Episode 4 restored to the theater version in DVD.  The success of E4 was not expected by anyone, especially George Lucas and the various actors. That it was any thing other than a standard summer release was suprising, and sequels were not dreamed of, or expected...the surprise factor was enormous. You can thank the 'old timers' who watched the thing 5 or 6 times for it's success, and for allowing G. Lucas and crew to scamper to fill out the sequels. <br /> <br />A lot of backfilling was necessary.  It was like building a house from the roof down (and Revenge of the Sith is the basement).  The first was the best, and the rest have had to make do with slick special effects to make up for the plot problems.  I'm not complaining, but feel that the DVDs should have been available separately.  And available as the original theatrical version, for those of us who enjoyed the popcorn.
B000003TAB|5.0|Although this was intended to tide fans over until a new studio album after the overrated \\"Nevermind\\", this random collection of B-sides and other things is a great album from Nirvana, and as I stated in my title, it was, in my humble opinion, their best. It has heavy songs (Stain), catchy songs (Son of a Gun), and just plain weird songs (Mexican Seafood), but it all fits together to make one fantastic album.Here's a track-by-track overview:    1.Dive - A heavy mid-paced opener. Not the best lyrics, but a good song nonetheless. A ggod start to great album. 8.5/10    2.Sliver - Made it onto the best of album, and for good reason. This is catchy, fun, and has great lyrics (Grandma take me Home!), a perspnal favorite. 10/10    3.Stain - Heavy mid-paced rocker. I really like this one as well. One of the best. 9.5/10    4.Been a Son - Good song. Also made onto the Best Of album, although there are many superior cuts. Still a good song, though. 8/10    5.Turnaround - I don't like it. Not my style. 5/10    6.Molly's Lips - One of two Vaselines' covers. I don't know who the Vaselines are, but I should check em out, because the Vaselines covers are two of the best songs on the album. 10/10    7.Son of the Gun - The second Vaselines cover. My favorite track from this album. Feels like it could fit on Blink 182's \\"Buddha\\" album. 10/10.    8.(New wave) Polly - Very different than the original version on \\"Nevermind\\". Not better, not worse, just different. Sounds more punk than new wave. Ehhh.. 7/10.    9.Beeswax - Heavy guitars and mumbling. This is where the album starts to drag. 6/10.    10.Downer - Lives up to it's name. Dull, boring. 5/10.    11.Mexican seafood - More mumbling, YAY!!!!! 4/10.    12.Hairspray Queen - Horrible. just plain stupid. See \\"Tourettes\\", on \\"In Utero\\". 0/10.    13.Aero Zeppelin - Aother boring mumble track. Please save this album! 3/10.    14.Big Long Now - And here it comes! A sick rock tracks picks up this great album that wasn't so great for a fewtracks. Time for the Grand Finale! 8/10.    15.Aneurysm - Here it is. the best song Kurt ever wrote. If you haven't heard this song, you need to. A great way to end the album. 10/10.    I always thought Nirvana were hideously overrated... until I bought this album. It was an experience! It completely changed my perception of the band, while I still think some of their other albums are mediocre at best. If you don't already own this album, but it NOW!!!! Thank you.
0446310786|5.0|TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a Pulitzer Prize-winning classic of American literature. It may well be one of the five greatest books ever published in English (my other candidates are the King James Bible, anything by Shakespeare, MOBY DICK, and HUCKLEBERRY FINN).<br /><br />Written in 1960, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD at first seems to be a young girl's first-person reminiscence of childhood in a sleepy Depression-era Southern town. Author Harper Lee has steadfastly denied that the book is formally autobiographical, though many autobiographic elements clearly exist (the character of Dill is the author Truman Capote in childhood, a lifelong friend of Miss Lee's).<br /><br />The children spend much of the first half of the book whiling away their time at imaginative games and summer daydreams. Their waking world is peopled by a curiously colorful collection of neighbors who range from the sublime (Mrs. Dubose, a cantankerous Confederate widow quietly addicted to morphine) to the ridiculous (Miss Stephanie Crawford, the town's indefatigable gossip). Their waking nightmare consists of Boo Radley, a mysterious neighbor who they have never seen. The children construct elaborate fantasies of Boo, but as they grow older their deliciously terrifying imaginings of the man within the house at the end of the block become overshadowed by more frightening realities in the outside world.<br /><br />The children (narrator Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend, Dill) become unjaded observers of the daily drama of ordinary human life when their father, Atticus Finch, the town attorney, is assigned to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. The town becomes quietly inflamed as the submerged flotsam of prejudice floats to the surface of the residents' collective consciousness.<br /><br />Scout, Jem and Dill, along with their lifelong friends and neighbors, are forced to confront issues of justice, injustice, and their own identities, first as Southerners, second as Americans, but lastly and most importantly, as human beings who have the power to choose.<br /><br />Generations of young reviewers have attacked this book as \\"boring\\" and essentially incomprehensible.

B00005JNJT|5.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" is all about a man who battles his enemies and inner demons. It's about fear, acceptance, morality and reality: Batman is not a superhero. He doesn't have extraordinary powers. He's human, physically and emotionally. <br /> <br />Bruce Wayne is a fascist at heart - but has enough moral fiber to resist devolving into an executioner. \\"That is the only thing that separates us from them,\\" Bruce says in \\"Batman Begins.\\" And that's something that the film latches on to - amongst other topics - and what makes it not only the best of the \\"Batman\\" movies, but also a great film by any standard. <br /> <br />Christopher Nolan, the British filmmaker who bent all the rules in 2000 with the nonlinear and mind-boggling masterpiece \\"Memento\\", directed \\"Batman Begins.\\" When news first broke, many message boards churned with disgruntled fans claiming he was \\"selling out\\" by helming this project. What Nolan has actually done is take a severely over-bloated, seemingly unredeemable series of films and completely reformed them; \\"Batman Begins\\" opens with digital bats encompassing the screen, which is important, because otherwise countless cinemagoers would be sitting awestruck for sixty minutes, wondering whether they've walked into the wrong film. <br /> <br />\\"Begins\\" opens somewhere in Asia. Bruce has voluntarily become a prisoner in order to research the lives of criminals. When he is visited by a mysterious guru named Ducard (Liam Neeson), Bruce is freed from jail and becomes Ducard's protg. Ducard is a member of the League of Shadows, an ancient ninja brotherhood bent on the destruction of all evil and wrongdoing. Of course, their methods are flawed. Bruce flees back to Gotham City after refusing to murder a rapist on Ducard's command. He invests stock in his father's old company, Wayne Corp., and uses the underground lab of the facility to \\"borrow\\" high-tech military weaponry. <br /> <br />Bruce and his butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), hide the equipment underneath the Wayne Estate in a creepy old bat cave. Bruce takes on the persona of Batman and begins to fight crime under the watchful eye of the corrupt city. <br /> <br />Gotham's only honest cop, Sgt. Gordon (Gary Oldman), who comforted Bruce as a child after his parents died, is the only person who believes Batman means well - others think he is a sadistic criminal, especially after a famous mob boss (Tom Wilkinson) is found pinned to a skylight, his drug-smuggling thugs all left unconscious. <br /> <br />Assistant District Attorney Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) meanwhile finds reason to believe that the city's resident psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), may be involved in a scheme to harm Gotham with the help of an outsider - she is subsequently put on a hit list and Batman, who learns the truth, races against time to save her. (Oh, yeah, she was Bruce's childhood friend, too; which is more a convenience than a coincidence.) <br /> <br />I admire the technical skill of this production. The fight scenes are fast and blurred - I usually hate this, but it works well in \\"Batman Begins,\\" because we're meant to fear the unknown. Sounds are used to great effect. Cinematically, Batman becomes a movie monster on occasion - the scene where a group of smugglers are picked off one-by-one in the darkness, with scattering sounds overhead and screams and gunshots piercing the silence, brings to mind Ridley Scott's \\"Alien.\\" In another segment, Batman questions Crane while he is on drugs, which results in some truly terrifying images that will shock children who are familiar with Batman as a flawless hero. <br /> <br />I also like the fact that Nolan - who admittedly does not prefer using modern special effects - bases his film around the characters so much indeed that he uses very little CGI. Apart from a few action sequences and swarms of bats, most of \\"Batman Begins\\" is real, and that really impressed me. (I do not like modern effects, either.) I could tell the city was real, I could tell the Batmobile was real, and I could tell Batman was real. Remember the segment in \\"Batman and Robin\\" where they surf 30,000 feet above ground on pieces of an exploding rocket ship and look like cartoon characters? There's none of that crap here. <br /> <br />The script is by David Goyer, who co-wrote the visionary \\"Dark City.\\" That film was heavily influenced by German expressionism - it moved quickly, awkwardly, with scenes interrupting other scenes out of the blue. <br /> <br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is formed on a similar scale. During action sequences, it's not rare to suddenly see other characters, far away, in the middle of a discussion, before cutting back to the action. I would usually detest this, because in most American films it's a sign of poor editing, sloppy writing or bad direction; but I think it works here - not because it's a comic book movie like \\"Sin City,\\" but because it's just the style of the film itself. Complemented by the fast editing and Nolan's impressive direction, \\"Batman Begins\\" walks the fine line between pretentiousness and sloppiness - it is artsy and careful, clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes, but the edits and fight sequences are clearly inspired. <br /> <br />Bale is perfect as Batman, and the best yet, because he fits every aspect of the character; he is believable as a smug, ruthless playboy. We can see him as a troubled young man haunted by his past and an unbearable sense of guilt. And in the suit, he looks confident without being comfortable - he's still learning how to adapt. We can imagine how far he will progress in the sequels when, at the end of \\"Begins,\\" he has finally become the Batman we all know. <br /> <br />The rest of the cast range from above average to very good: Michael Caine is fun as Alfred; Katie Holmes is surprisingly better than expected, Gary Oldman is great whilst Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer are pushed aside somewhat, serving little purpose. Liam Neeson is somewhere in between. <br/> <br />The movie is grim like Burton's but more realistic, and not as glossy and perfect; the suit is imperfect, Batman's technology and secrets are exposed, the Batmobile is ugly and efficient, and the bat cave was originally part of the underground railroad and doesn't have any gadgets or special super-duper display cases for the suits. (I never did understand the point of encasing the Bat Suit in a special shiny glass container when no one was supposed to even see it except Bruce and Alfred.) <br /> <br />In an era when bigger is better, and audiences are used to Batman making his appearance on-screen in mere minutes of each film, \\"Begins\\" does something completely unexpected (and risky). It actually takes its time. Bruce Wayne doesn't don his famous suit and cape for the first hour of the film - and when he finally does, the costume isn't fantasized. It's imperfect, awkward and ugly. And best of all, there are no bat-nipples this time. All considered, is it really so surprising that \\"Batman Begins\\" has only made a disappointing $71 million in its first week? Audiences are not used to blockbusters of such depth, scale and grandeur. Especially if it has the word \\"Batman\\" in its title.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|I would suggest this film to everyone,what a twisted story.This is one of those movies you have to follow and then the last five minutes brings it all together.But because of this fact you can only watch it once. So i suggest renting it,instead of buying it.If you are reading this Tom Hall e mail me and i will explain the ending.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Sure...UPN can let a mediocre Star Trek Enterprise run for several years, but you get a new, smart Sci-Fi show and the stuffed shirts at Fox pull it after only episodes.  Way to give it a chance Fox, I guess they needed more air-time for Man Vs. Beast or When Animals Attack # 175.  What made this sci-fi Western unique was that this was still a human show.  There were no aliens.  The Crew of the Firefly was led by Captain Mal Reynolds played by Nathan Fillion who Buffy fans will remember as the evil priest on the last few episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Other cast members included: Adam Baldwin as the mercenary Jayne Cobb, and Ron Glass of Barney Miller fame as \\"Book\\" a mysterious minister.  They make up the crew of the ship Serenity as the group of rogues struggles to make their way taking whatever jobs they can, which often make then less than your stereotypical heroes.  Characters is what makes a great show and Whedon knows great characters and delivers again with a fantastic ensemble cast, all perfectly suited for the varying roles they are portraying.  Not only did Fox cancel the show early, but they showed the episodes out of order from what Whedon wanted.  But hey, thank God for DVD as you get all 14 episodes in all their glory.<br /><br />Among my favorite episodes are:<br /><br />\\"Out of Gas\\"  A flashback episode that details how mal acquired the Serenity and how each of the members joined the crew.<br /><br />\\"Ariel\\"  The crew visit a planet called Ariel where tehy attempt to get simon into a hospital to use a machine to help River.  They pose as dead bodies and are eventually captured by the Alliance.<br /><br />\\"War Stories\\"  Mal and Walsh are kidnapped by Niska who wants payback for the botched train robbery in the first episode.<br /><br />\\"Serenity parts 1 & 2\\"  is great as well.  Given Whedon's track record it's just incredible that Fox didn't allow the show to develop.  This was really a sci-fi show for people who are not necessarily Sci-fi fans.  The backdrop was the future but this was a very human drama much the way that Buffy was and sucked in many people who were not horror fans or who were older.  I feel about Firefly much the way I feel about another Fox show that got a raw deal, Brimstone.  Stupid Fox!Sci-fi fans.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|I had heard of this movie from various people, but had seen very little in the way of publicity. So, I knew that it was a comedy - the title alone gives that away. <br /> <br />Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie - I have only watched it once. I found the relationships between the characters to be convincing, and likeable, and the characters themselves to be well portrayed. They aren't over the top as you might expect in an American movie - such as Evil Dead 2 or a Farrely Brothers movie. There's no doubt that they are templates or archetypes - the movie later alludes to this fact in what was both a rather obvious but stylishly brief scene. Still, the actors wear the characters well, and none of them feels exactly cliche, except for the effete boyfriend. <br /> <br />The humor is pretty fast. The movie doesn't spend a great deal of time telegraphing a joke, or hanging around after the punchline. Nor is it absurdist in the sense that it consists of non-sequitirs or visual puns. It copies the style used by Guy Richie in Snatch and others of fast cuts, such as the scene when Shaun and Ed are planning their course of action after they'e figured out that there's something funny going on.  <br /> <br />The horror is mixed freely with the humor. Its pretty light horror. As zombies go, these are pretty typical. Slow, shambling, stupid, and apparently only inclined to attack people who don't act like zombies - they aren't the most terrifying creatures to be conceived of but their dead eyes and propensity for remaining alive once impaled does make them ghoulish. The fact that these are people the characters used to know is what makes it worse, and adds a bit to the horror. <br /> <br />The movie's final quarter is its weakest part. It's not bad at all, but it's a little heavy handed and corny compared to the far leaner and more clever first 3/4, which is my main reason for giving it a less than perfect review. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Not only the smash hit We belong together which has been No.1 on billboard chart hot 100 singles is excellent. After listening to the album,you'll find every song of this amazing album is koo. I've never enjoyed another R&B album this year that much.Mariah Carey's album totally worth ur money:)Go and buy it,you'll find what is a diva really is.Let me tell,it is the best R&B album that Mimi has ever released!
B000002J0B|5.0|There are few bands as good as Led Zeppelin. Between 1969 and 1980 they had SIX five star albums. Few bands can live up to that standard. I would include Pink Floyd, The Beatles and AC/DC in this catagory......groups that can CONSISTENTLY produce the highest quality music, with Floyd being the most prolific and longest lasting. Zeppelin burned out after 6 albums, AC/DC after 6 or 7. Floyd had like 10 or so. Anyway, this is quite possibly my favorite Zeppelin album. Well, maybe Zeppelin IV is my favorite (its more HARD rock and roll and everysong was a radio hit.....not that that matters, the radio hit thing). On \\"Houses of the Holy\\" Zeppelin seems to have hit their peak. And the scary thing?? I believe Page turned a ripe ole' 25 when this album dropped. Can you imagine being THAT GOOD (and THAT POPULAR) at the age of twenty five???? Or think that he was only 20 or so when the first Zeppelin albums dropped. Greatest guitarist ever??? I dont know. Toss up between Page, Hendrix and Gilmour. But each had their own style, so one could say they were the best in their own genre. I love every song on this album, ESPECIALLY the slower ones. They seem to take hold of you somwhow. Zeppelin were great artists, in every use of the term. Their albums were works of art. They painted a picture with their music. I believe Zeppelin was the greatest rock and roll outfit to EVER bless us with their work. My favorite song on this album??? Probably....wow this is hard, its like trying to pick your favorite pet or kid.....maybe \\"Rain Song\\" \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" or \\"Dancing Days\\" or maybe \\"The Crunge\\" (which sounds a hell of alot like \\"Planet Caravan\\" off Sabbath's classic 'Paranoid' album. Maybe they smoked the same s*** together. Who knows) or maybe \\"No Quarter\\" or \\"The Ocean\\" or maybe \\"Dy Er Maker\\" or even \\"Song Remains the Same\\". Oh, I'm sorry, I just named EVERY SONG ON THE DAMN ALBUM. See what I mean. Best damn ROCK band ever.
B0007TKNCY|1.0|Bringing Up Baby is just another glowing example of what happens when you place great actors in bad parts.  Here we have two of Hollywood's most respected actors demonstrating that they cannot handle such a convoluted story such as this.  In fact, give this story to even any of the actors throughout the history of Hollywood this story and I don't think anyone could have pulled it off.  Let's get right down to it, the story is what hurt this film.  I agree that I don't think Katharine Hepburn should have dabbled in comedy, especially with a script like this, but I guess she could only work with what she had ... which was nothing.  Air, space, and dead time would have created better viewing than this story did, but alas, director Howard Hawks decides to fill that space with annoying songs, backwards stories, and characters that never quite leap out of the puddles of mediocrity that they sleep in.<br /><br />What really hurts this story is that there is too much happening to allow any real comedy to develop.  From the uncharacteristic meeting between David and Susan to the dinosaur bone to the leopard in the yard, I never quite saw the humor in it.  In fact, I hardly laughed at this film at all.  I felt Hepburn gave one of her worst performances as this annoying rich girl that gets upset whenever she doesn't get what she wants.  Grant tries to counter the horrid acting by Hepburn by playing his character a bit low key, but the chemistry never quite develops.  There is no spark between the two.  I never felt like they were really in love.  Hepburn's comic timing was incredibly off in this film, causing most of the film to follow her lead.  The rest of the cast would try to overcompensate for her misjudgment causing even more chaos in this film.  One scene that immediately comes to mind is when Susan and David, with the dog, are singing to \\"Baby\\" on the rooftop.  All of their voices together were like fingernails on a chalkboard.  Was this to be funny?  I am glad that we have evolved a bit further than this in that genre or it may have died directly after this film was made.  Comedy is not something that can be taught.  You either have it or you don't, and I do not believe Hepburn had it.<br /><br />No matter how bad the acting was, it still didn't compare to the nightmarish story.  Perhaps I missed something throughout my 102-minute viewing, but the elements of this \\"screwball comedy\\" just never congealed together that well. Coupled with the below par acting, this film really never got off the ground.  As audience members, we were mislead from the beginning and never quite found our stepping for the remaining moments.  For example, during the opening credit sequences and on the discs of the DVD there are images of Hepburn and Grant helping the leopard eat and live life as if it was their child.  It shows the leopard in diapers and in other whimsical hijinks, but we were not privileged enough to see that in the actual film.  If that had been a bigger part of the story, than I think perhaps the comedy aspect would have been greater.  We needed more moments with \\"Baby\\" instead of trying to build a relationship between David and Susan literally out of nothing.  With a lacking chemistry, a poor excuse for a story, and comedy that was perhaps written by \\"Baby\\" herself, this 102-minute film felt more like 302 minutes of living, breathing torture.<br /><br />Overall, I just could not get excited about this film.  This was one of those movies that took me two nights to finish because I just couldn't wrap my hands around anything substantial.  I wanted greater comedy, but outside of Grant, our characters just acted annoying rather than funny.  Hepburn was completely miscast in this feature, and the entire twenty minutes at the end of the film seemed rather rushed and aggravating than whimsical.  I was hoping that this film would be more about the leopard instead of the people, but director Howard Hawks took it in a different direction, which ultimately hurt the outcome.  This should have been a movie about a leopard co-starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, not the other way around.  I didn't enjoy this movie in the least, and still wake up sweating at nights after nightmares of Hepburn, the dog, and Grant singing to the leopard.  Ughhhhhhh.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****n, which ultimately hurt the outcome.  This should have been a movie about a leopard co-starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, not the other way around.

B000244FDW|4.0|This is in almost every way better than the A & E version. It is much more truer to the spirit of the novel, it feels like you have jumped into a time machine and gone back to regency England. The actors are all superb, even the minor characters are well rounded. It has none of the `over the top' acting you got in the 1995 version. A few that stand out include the absolutely gorgeous Elizabeth Garvie, whose portrayal of Elizabeth is exquisite, none of the petulant smirking we got from Jennifer Ehle. She portrays Eliza as the intelligent and lively character that Austen intended. You can see why Darcy is attracted to her (I certainly was), I feel that the 1995 version failed to establish this. David Rintoul is superb as Mr. Darcy chiefly because he looks like him (I am sorry Colin), he is stiff, proud and arrogant just like in the novel. You can see why Elizabeth dislikes him, witness some of his exchanges with Elizabeth at Netherfield and Rosings, the underlying tension, absolutely superb. One of my problems with Firth's Darcy is one that other reviewers have already alluded to - he is too likeable. There seems very little reason for Elizabeth to dislike him, in fact she is far more disagreable than he is. My one gripe with Rintoul is that I was not totally convinced with his change in manners when they meet at Pemberley, he is still too stiff. Firth was excellent in his portrayal of the `reformed' Darcy. Charlotte and Mr. Collins are also well acted, she is sensible, realistic and still a great friend to Eliza not the snob that she was portrayed in 1995. Mr. Collins is a believable character not the caricature of 1995 version , he is still pompous and annoying, but you can see what makes him tick. Mr. & Mrs. Bennett are well portrayed, the Bennett sisters look alike as do the Bingley sisters.     My one major complaint with this version is that it meddles with the ending as was the case with 1995 version. I've never understood why directors/script-writers constantly interfere with what is a classic ending. Both versions seem to have been rushed as if the production teams realised that time was short and wrapped it up in a hurry. There are also some minor changes in the dialogue, but nothing too alarming as was the case with the 1995 version. Jane Austen's dialogue is the highlight of all her books, why would you change it? Then again I suppose that is why I am writing this review and not having my scripts filmed in Hollywood.     I enjoyed this immensely. Others have pointed to the budget limitations, but I for the life of me do not see how this has any relevance. This is a period piece not an action spectacular. A higher budget would just encourage directors to meddle with what is a great book in an attempt to justify expenditure (any one who has caught a glimpse of the 2005 P & P big screen version will know what I mean).    My best advice is to buy both versions and you'll not be disappointed. The earlier version is truer to the book, while the latter does the romance better.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Mezmerize isn't exacly what i exected. Daron is allowed to sing far too much in this album, his voise is  not System of a Down. BYOB although, is an awesome song and like the old system. The others though are a dissapointment. I am still System fan, but I will resort to the old albums instead of this one. Read my other System reveiws and see why.
B0007NFL18|2.0|I will totally agree that 50's first album was a good album.  Being that 50 cent is not much of a lyricist, Eminem and Dr. Dre still help produce an enjoyable album.  A sophomore album should put your signature stamp of approval in the game.  A sophomore album should show that you are a credible artist instead of a lucky first timer.  A sophomore album should boast growth in your lyrical ability, delivery, and content.  Though redundant, a prime example would be The Notorious BIG.  Unfortunately, 50 stuck to a formula that would insure that he would sell records and not a formula that would boast his \\"skills\\" or love for hip hop.  As I said before, 50 is not much of a lyricist but he can be.  A sophomore album has to be based on more than lyrical drive-bys.  Candy Shop, Disco Inferno, and Just A Lil' Bit sound like nursery rhymes.  As an artist, you have a nerve to challenge credible rappers in the game with this ABC stuff?  50, you have to bring something to the table than just hit and misses.  Also, being a millionaire does not mean that you have talent.  This was a very weak second record and I hope that Tony Yayo takes a bit of independence on his album.  Judging from his first single, \\"Thoughts of a Predicate Felon\\" looks to be another massacred album.  Shape up G-Unit.
B0007OY2MG|4.0|I really enjoy watching the Gilmore Girls.  It's light and fun, yet deep enough to make you think about certain issues; especially those involving family; and even more specifically in the mother/daughter relationship.  We see how great this relationship can be in the Lorelei/Rory pairing; and how difficult and complex in the Emily/Lorelei one.<br /><br />This said, I find that the show needs to finetune some elements:<br /><br />1.  I agree with the previous reviewer who comments that no one in real life speaks so quickly.  In reference to Lorelei, I would also add, no one in real life speaks with so many wordplays, pop culture, and literary references and at such speaking speeds.  It's more than a bit unrealistic.  I would have to agree with Luke saying that Lorelei can be obnoxious, I feel like finding her \\"off\\" button many times.<br /><br />2.  I found
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I just bought this CD, 1 year after it was released. I wanted to see if Avril could prove herself again on a followup to her 200 success \\"Let Go\\". And she did it! even better with great, more mature, fun songs. Here is a track list and ratings. <br /> <br />1) \\"Take Me Away\\"- 4/5, This song is fun and  very catchy. It is a great start to the album. <br /> <br />2) \\"Together\\"- 3/5, A good song. Talking about how it feels better when she is alone. Took a few listen to catch me though. <br /> <br />3) \\"Don't Tell Me\\"- 4/5, Her first single released off the album. I liked this song alot, it's got a strong meaning behind it and it is super catchy. <br /> <br />4) \\"He Wasn't\\"- 3/5, This reminds me of \\"Sk8ter Boi\\" from her last album. It definatly is a high energy song and is catchy but not my fav on the album. <br /> <br />5) \\"How Does It Feel\\"- 3/5, A ballad from Avril? OMG! It is pretty good to. Very mature for her. <br /> <br />6) \\"My Happy Ending\\"- 4/5, One of my favorites on the album. We have all heard it on the radio. The chorus is awesome! <br /> <br />7) \\"Nobody's Home\\"- 5/5, Definatly my favorite on the album. Such an awesome song with strong lyrics. <br /> <br />8) \\"Forgotten\\"- 4/5, Great lyrics and sound. <br /> <br />9) \\"Who Knows\\"- 4/5, This song is growing on me bigtime. Defiantly a hit. <br /> <br />10) \\"Fall To Pieces\\"- 4/5, Her latest single off the album. It is a great song and tells a story. I love it. <br /> <br />11) \\"Freak Out\\"- 4/5, Another high energy song with awesome lyrics. <br /> <br />12) \\"Slipped Away\\"- 3/5, This is the only song on the album that is just O.K. Maybe I just haven't gotten into it. Who knows. Not bad though. <br /> <br />SO OVERALL.....This album is so much more mature then \\"Let Go\\". There are no BAD songs on this album and each song has a special meaning to go along. I can't wait for her third album and I am glad I decided to buy this one a year later! Go Avril!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is a must have.<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned the last 30 seconds of 'Pet', it's actually from 3:42 until the end of the song. If you don't have this album find someone that does and listen to the last minute of PET, if you don't like that then don't buy the album. The short guitar solo, is unbelievable in that it is so awesome yet uses very few notes.  The closest thing that I can remember to  this solo is one of Tony Iommi's solos on Black Sabbath's LIVE AT LAST.  In fact if the guitar was played with distortion, you would swear it WAS IOMMI. The drum fills (2 major ones and a few minors ones) during the solo are amazing, and then the guitar solo gives way to A Perfect Circles trademark Harmony..<br /><br />If a band can have a Perfect 58 seconds this is it.<br /><br />And since I'm on a Sabbath kick.  Go 3 minutes and 13 seconds into 'The Outsider', close your eyes and try tp convince yourself that you are not listening to something off of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Sabotage. There is definately a heavy Sabbath influence there, which is fine by me..<br /><br />Other personal favorites are Blue and The Noose (awesome lyrics) and of course 'The Outsider' and 'A Stranger'..<br /><br />\\"The Vanishing' is sort of weak, but it gives you time to catch your breath in between 'Blue' and 'A Stranger'<br /><br />Other 'must have' albums in my collection... The first seven Sabbath Albums, the first 2 Def Leppard albums, the first 2 Maiden Albums, every Scorpion Album up to and including Black Out, Metallica's KILL 'EM All, Anthrax's Fistful of Metal, Judas Priest anything prior to Screaming for Vengence... Nazareth's Hair of the Dog, and Razamanaz, Riot's (NOT QUIET RIOT) Fire Down Under,(probably the GREATEST HARD ROCK album ever released) anything by Stabbing Westward (some of the greatest lyrics ever incorporated in to songs), and finally anything by Tool and A perfect Circle (thank goodness someone is still making great music).> <br />    <br />
B0002TSZK6|5.0|For a long time I was a little bit reserved to see this film and I strongly believed that George Bush would be reelected in 2004, as it happened. Of course I knew the Demeocrats' thesis on Bush's first election and the war in Iraq but I decided to see Michael Moore's film when it became clear that Iraq has been turned into a quagmire for the US Army, draining its resources and killing and maiming its volunteer personnel. The film was a nice surprise. It uses plain language and very well selected scenes, it avoids the silly conspiracy theories, presents only the facts and gives voice to some of the US soldiers who served in Iraq. The most moving part of the film is the middle-aged woman who was very patriotic and proud of the US military and then suddenly lost the ground under her feet when her son was killed in Iraq. The grave mistakes of the \\"neocons\\" team and the underestimation of the Iraqi insurgency is just showing up in full force. Moore's film is a fine documentary account of the facts that led to the current painful situation.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok first of all i want to say how great this cd is from beginning to end.  I would also like to clear up on the fact that some people are saying that the people who like radiohead are people who are depressed and have no friends that is certainly untrue.  And that we are the type of people who sit home on a friday night that is certainly not true.  A lot of the people who listen to Radiohead are more of your artistically weird type of people, people who are the type of people who like to think and think a lot.  The type of people who are more to use theeir left side of the brain more than their right.  now i am not saying that everyone who uses their right dont like Radiohead and i am not saying that everyone who uses their right hates Radiohead.  I am just simply saying that the mafority of the people who listen to Radiohead are more of your Artistically wierd type people. <br />Now i would liek to say that they do play Radiohead videos on tv and most of the videos they played were from Ok Computer.  The songs from ok computer that were music videos on MTV were No Surprises which they played quit a bit, Karma Police which was played but not as much but which was on TRL for a while and Paranoid Android which to me was actually played a lot on TV cuz in 97 i watched MTV because even then they played music unlike now and i remeber they actually over played paranoid android becuase it was such a big hit and it was different concidering it is a really wierd but unique concept of a cartoon. <br />Now for the cd it is amazing.  My favorite song or should i say monologue on the track is fitter happier for the reason that i am working on a piece i am choreographing and the whole story revolves on how i view that song as the perfect person no one is and how we all strive to be this perfect person. But in reality we wouldnt want to be the perfect person because we would be a deformed member of society.  Fitter Happier is one of my favorites beause it can be a real interestingpiece with out being creepy (honestly i dont think it is creepy, the monologue just makes you think), but if you feel its creepyness and view it in a piece then it can become the thought about piece on the program whether you dis like it or not.   <br />Now sorry for the story there i got carried away as you can tell.  I have tried some other music some of you guys have put out there like Cynic and Watchtower which are both black/death metal which i can see why they are underground cuz actually no death/balck metal is mainstream.  Now i love black metal like Dimmu borgir, lamb of god, cannibal corpse but these bands ive heard on hear BARF that is not good death/balck metal.  and as for Gordian Know I cant stand it i mean i am not a real big jazz type of person and personally i think Radiohead mixes the jazz into the hole Alternative better than they do.  Gordian just drags on and on and on.  now for Spiral Architect all they are is a remake of The Darkness and dont get me wrong i like the Darkness but another band like them i cant stand and they will never be famouse or i shall say be mainstream cuz they litterally mock the Darkness in most keyword MOST ways. The Artwork on all the cds you guys have mentioned is awsome and really catches the eyes. <br />Now for my ratings of the songs:  <br />Airbag - 10/10 <br />Paranoid Android - 10/10 <br />Subterranean Homsick Alien - 9/10 <br />Exit Music (For A Film) - 15/10 - For being the perfect song for      <br />                                  Romeo and juliette if you didnt  <br />                                  then you shoudnt say why you             <br />                                  hate or love them becuase 1 you   <br />                                  are not a true fan and 2 you  <br />                                  dont know them as much as you  <br />                                  you think you do and shouldnt  <br />                                  judge their music. <br />Let Down - 10/10 <br />Karma Police - 15/10 <br />Fitter Happier - 20/10 - even though a lot of you dont really  <br />                         this song it is my favorite do to my way  <br />                         of thinking.  COMPUTERIZED voice really  <br />                         makes you think. <br />Electioneering - 9/10 - Becuase they can show you they can rock  <br />                        and that they are not just depressing. <br />Climbing up the walls - 12/10 <br />No Surprises - 15/10 <br />Lucky - 9/10 <br />The Tourist - 9/10 <br /> <br />Now all though i dont think this cd beats Kid A i still think it is way better then the BENDS all though my favorite song is FAKE PLASTIC TREES it is still a good album and probably their best album as a group musically, vocally, and controversialy (spelled wrong most likely).  Now this cd is one of the greatest albums of all time concidering it was rated number 4 out of 100 on the british charts.  and not only the british voted on it americans did as well.  1 was OASIS 2 and 3 the Beatles with srgt peppers and revolver and 4 and 10 Radiohead with ok computer and the bends although i think 10 should have been kid a.  <br />But the cd as a hole is great and i love tom yourkes voice but if you dont you should realize that Tom Yorke is more of a songwriter then a singer and anyway he is great because of all the emotion he adds to his music. <br /> <br />
B000286S8S|4.0|I LOVE Van Halen very much. They are in my top five favorite groups of all time. I love this CD.It basically puts David Lee Roth against Sammy Hagar. There are a few glaring problems however: <br />    <br />   1. The idiotic random order. I can put my CD player on \\"shuffle\\" if I wish. I don't have a nice \\"Chronological Order\\" button however. Even reverse chronological order from present to past would have been fine. Just make a Roth disc and a Hagar disc, maybe put a Cherone song on one of them or something <br /> <br />   2. The album's liner notes rudely have no photos of David Lee Roth (unless you count his blurry microscopic pictures on the pictures of the albums on the discography). They say nice things about him and stuff but stil.... <br /> <br />   3. Gary Cherone is given no mention as existing as part of the band. None of the songs off of the album he cut with the band (Van Halen 3) are on the compilation. The album is not mentioned in the discography section. He is even made fun of in a subtle manner. <br /> <br />   4. The inclusion of 3 live songs which are Sammy Hagar singing David Lee Roth Songs. They are unnecessary. They don't sound too bad but its a bit blasphemous to put it on a \\"Best Of\\" compilation. Especially since the songs are heard earlier in the album anyway. These could have been omitted in favor of a few better songs. <br /> <br />   Some problems other people have with the album that I disagree with are: <br /> <br />   1. Others will say the 3 brand new songs on the album suck. I don't believe so. They lack a catchy hook, but otherwise they are really fun to play LOUD! <br /> <br />   2. Everybody complains that the song \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" is cut off at the end as sort of a clever play on its title... get a life, seriously. <br /> <br />   Anyway, its an essential for anyone that loves Van Halen. <br /> <br />    <br /> <br />
B000002L61|5.0|If you want to start listening to Dio, the best place to start with is here. If you like Dio and don't have this CD, then get it. Better than Holy Diver and somewhere around the same as Sacred Heart.
0385510454|1.0|I have loved all of John Grisham's books. That's why this one is so dissapointing. This book spends 3/4s of it's time telling us how the main character learns Italian. 1/5th of the time describing italian food, resturants, and sights. And almost no time in any interesting plot at all. All I can think is Grisham went to Italy. Wrote an intricate diary of what he saw. And then decided to bore us with a recounting of every darn detail <br />of it. Oh well, I'm still looking forward to his next one. Everyone is entitled to a mis-step every now and then.
B000002H2H|5.0|I have heard every Metallica album. none of them can compare. sure you say master of puppets but that doesnt have as many kick ass songs and is overrated because of the title track. <br />get this if you like Metallica or you like metal, either way, you still need this, it's manditory over all of the 3/4 of the big 4 (including Slayer, Megadeth, and Antrax, all good bands)
B00006CXSS|5.0|Powerful award winning miniseries follow the true story of the Screaming Eagles 101st Airborne 506 parachute infantry regiment Easy Company.  Not only does it tell the full story of Easy Company from formation to the end of World War 2, but it puts you into their lives, like you are actually there. I have yet to have seen a miniseries or movie this powerful. You see their transformation from boys to men. From the training in Camp Tacoa, Ga. to parachute landings behind enemy lines on D-Day, to the Battle of the Bulge, to the Nazi Prison Camps, to the capturing of Adolf Hitlers Eagles Nest in Nazi Controlled Austria. When they lose a \\"brother\\" you feel like you've lost a brother, when they take an obstical, you feel like you've taken that obstical with them.  Last episode is a documentary on the real men of Easy Company, and its videos like this, that makes me look at my World War 2 veteran grandfather, and see him like i've never seen him before.  There is not enough stars to give this.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is my favorite Coldplay album hands down. I love \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to The Head,\\" but X&Y has this instant familiarity to it that its predecessors lacked, at least in the first couple of listens. A large part of why the album is so accessible is that it follows in the footsteps of the previous efforts, which are by now very familiar to me.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Square One\\", which I like to think of as an ode to the lost souls of the world that run in circles trying to find themselves and break free but most of the time end up at square one. Ironically, it's a very uplifting song; I like it.<br /><br />\\"What If\\" is another favorite of mine. I love how it starts slow and then slowly build up a soaring crescendo that truly brings to the forefront why this band, like U2, Radiohead and other Brit bands, will stand the test of time.<br /><br />I like all tracks on this release without an exception. If I have to pick out favorites, they've got to be: Square One, What If, Speed of Sound, Talk, White Shadows, X&Y, Low, Hardest Part and Fix You. Yeah, pretty much the whole album :-)<br /><br />There is at least 7 songs of this album on each playlist I'm currently listening to on my iPod. It took me a little over 6 months to put \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" to rest, and I suspect it'll take me even longer to say \\"catch ya later\\" to this masterpiece.<br /><br />You've got to get it. It's the best album released this year; well, that and the Postal Service's :-)
034544678X|5.0|This is not a step-by-step dog training book, but it contains so much insightful information about not only your dog's behavior, but also your own and what you can do to make your lives more enjoyable together.  I have watched several dog training videos which are helpful and our dog has learned many commands but The Other End of the Leash has really enlightened me on doggie behavior.  I am almost finished with the book and feel that I have a much better understanding of my dog and how important it is to be a benevolent leader. <br />Our dog is coming almost always now when called.  Not coming consistently was becoming a bigger problem and we were at our wit's end at what to do.  This author describes how our natural efforts to get a dog to come (moving toward the dog) only causes confusion for the dog and frustration for the human.  She sprinkles in good, practical advice among a lot of interesting reading...stories of her dogs, her clients, and her studies of animal behavior.  At first, her mild self-deprecation and \\"political correctness\\" as mentioned in many of the reviews here were a bit offputting to me but I got over that quickly because she knows her subject.  (And she really loves dogs!).  I am recommending this read to all of my friends with dogs....it is an invaluable resource.
0671027387|4.0|This 2001 thriller from Dan Brown is, like ANGELS AND DEMONS and THE DAVINCI CODE, full of unexpected twists and turns sure to keep a reader in danger of missing meals, appointments and reading far into the night.<br /><br />The plot centers on Americans this time mostly those in power in Washington.  Ambitious Senator Sexton would like to be the next occupant of the White House.  This is a very real possibility since the current occupant, Zachery Herney has been slipping in the polls lately and has lately seem to withdraw from the campaign.  Sexton has been pressing his attack on Herney's beloved NASA and the public has been increasingly in agreement with him.<br /><br />Soon though the action shifts from the corridors of power in the Capitol to the Artic.  NASA has found a meteor embedded in a glacier.  A most remarkable meteor.  Soon Sexton's estranged daughter Rachel is swept up into the action.  The action picks up speed and races along on land, in the air, on and under the water  making incredible plot twists along the way mixing Washington intrigue and scandal with scientific discovery, lies and suspense.<br /><br />The only place this novel seems to falter is at the end.  The final chapter seems to have been dashed off and is definitely not up to the standards of the rest of the book.<br /><br />That aside, this is a great read and will leave the reader searching for another novel from Brown.
B00000JZI9|4.0|The Silverado of the title is a town where all the main characters in the movie eventually meet up. There isn't really an overriding plot to the story. More like lots of subplots that collide from time to time. Scott Glenn and Kevin Coster are brothers on their way to Silverado to see their sister before heading on to California. Glenn just happens to have spent time in prison for killing a member of the family that owns most of the land around the town. Along the way they meet Kevin Cline who ends up riding with them to Silverado. Along the way he meets up with Brian Dennehy, an old friend he used to ride with before going to jail. Somewhere in all this they meet Danny Glover who is on his way back to the family farm. <br /> <br />Silverado has a great cast that also includes Jeff Goldblum, John Cleese and Linda Hunt. The action is rousing and well choreographed. The movie is a little long and could have used a trim timewise and cleaning some of the subplots up would have helped, but overall this is a very good western, especially for being made at a time when westerns weren't made.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|When I first heard this on NBC, I thought the sound was horrrible. I originally reviewed this and gave it two stars. The horns and fiddle a out of place, but they're not as dominant as I originally thought. Stuart Smith, the new guitarist is good, but he can't even hold a candle to Don Felder. His presence is especially missed on \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\"; Smith doesn't play slide, so it don't sound right. The horns are out of place on every song except \\"the Long Run\\". Joe Walsh really sounds good, compared to his appearance on \\"Hell Freezes Over\\"; in my opinion, he's the only Eagle who's vocal performance since \\"Hell\\". Glenn and Timothy have dropped just a bit, and Don Henley sounds more like Bryan Adams on his songs (on \\"Wasted Time\\" especially). Don's voice has really gotten rough. The sounds much improved, but I perfered the strings that appeared on \\"Hell\\". I wish they would have done some of there other songs, like \\"Get Over It\\", \\"Victim of Love\\", or \\"Those Shoes\\"....   ....oh, wait. Don Felder was vital to those songs. Just like Randy Meisner was to \\"Take It To The Limit\\" and \\"One of These Nights\\" (Randy did the high parts on \\"Nights\\"). The DVD is good. But by listening to \\"Live\\", \\"the Millenium Concert\\"(available on the \\"Selected Works\\" box set), and \\"Hell Freezes Over\\", you can see how important Don Felder is to the Eagles.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This CD is really good. There are a few ballads on here but most of the songs are uptempo. My favorite songs are the uptempo ones: \\"It's Like That,\\" \\"Shake It Off,\\" \\"Say Somethin' ft. Snoop,\\" \\"Get Your Number ft. JD,\\" \\"One and Only ft. Twista,\\" and To The Floor ft. Nelly.\\" But, then I like the slower songs also: \\"Stay The Night,\\" \\"Joy Ride,\\" \\"Your Girl,\\" \\"We Belong Together,\\" \\"Circles,\\" \\"I Wish You Knew,\\" \\"Mine Again,\\" and \\"Fly Like A Bird.\\" ------That means I like the whole CD but it depends on the mood I'm in whether or not I want to hear the slow or fast songs at a particular time.
B000051VWW|5.0|I Can Feel The Music.  I think that's what separates group like this from those pop and urban, fly by night groups that release a album or two, and are never heard from again.  A production by this group is always worth having, even if it doesn't have the material success of a more bubble gum, concept groups.  I give Sony Music, (the label at the time of this CDs release, major credit).  It had been 8 years since the release of Love Deluxe, and they could have pulled the plug on this album prior to release.  By 2000, Sade was a Smooth Jazz Mainstay, but not a mainstream hit machine.  Sony, gambling on the groups fans to come through with sales, released the Lovers Rock Compact Disc and a Live Concert DVD.  Both had strong sales thanks to the quality of the music, and the loyalty of the fans.
B000093FLA|5.0|In all likelihood, one doesn't. One simply accepts the cuffs and moves on, albeit less voluntarily than usual, with a worldly, almost noble, resignation of the small-time get-rich-quick scam artist. <br /> <br />Scenes like these are so difficult to explain in terms of their sidesplitting humour. Yet, from the minute that Boris the Blade, with unparalleled panache, walks off with the briefcase and the arm belonging to the now deceased Four Fingers Frankie, you will be hooked. The cast is impeccable and Brad Pitt steals the show as an Irish Gypsy prizefighter. Mr. Pitt, if you haven't seen him in this and other quirky roles, would appear to be just another of Hollywood pretty faces. But nobody, as pretty or less, can pull off the low-life, the unwashed, or the sleaze quite like our Brad. He is so extremely talented. It will warm your heart to see him in an entirely different venue, the UK, where few American actors could overcome the good looks and provincial fetters of US only roles. He shines and sweats, (you could almost smell this guy), he seeks vengeance and displays good old Gypsy smarts when the very bad guys burn down the family caravan with his sainted Ma within. Big credits to the artiste who created the tattoos adorning this bare-knuckles champion's stringy body and the costume designer who came up with his leather jacket and hat ensemble. <br /> <br />This and so much, much more could be detailed in a review to exhort readers to see this film. The only thing I can say is that once you gotten to the arm and briefcase scene, you will be glued.
0385512104|3.0|In a joking manner, this book might be referred to as \\"Autism for Dummies\\"..and I mean that in the best way possible.  I think that this book succeeds because it reads like a technical manual for the autistic brain, complete with analogies and helpful diagrams.    As such, it is invaluable in helping the layperson understand autism.  But it is not great literature.  The plot does not really sustain interest.  Instead, the interest is generated by devices ( like mathemathical puzzles--astoundingly mysterious to those who are \\"left brain-challenged\\".  Magic tricks, anyone?).Maybe in the end this is \\"fiction for people who don't like fiction.\\"  It also clearly was written for a 'youth market'.    It's a fine book on a worthy subject, but it pales next to a dazzling contemporary work like Joy Williams' \\"Quick and the Dead\\".  So, Williams gets a dozen reviews while this book grabs 865 and rising.  The autistic savant Christopher, as keen as he is at observing human nature, could never solve that particular mystery.
B0002S947K|5.0|last night i was watching \\"rescue me\\" and the song \\"burn\\" was featured in a very important, disturbing, and incredibly emotional scene... i bawled my eyeballs out for the next half hour.  that song is probably the alltime greatest lostlove song and is just agonizing to anyone who's felt that way.   i immediately went to the computer in the morning and, thanks to the internet, was easily able to find out who created this mindblowingly beautiful song.  i'm not sure about the whole album just yet, it seems a little too precious at times, but \\"burn\\" is, well, i was gonna say \\"arguably\\" but i'm changing it to \\"definetely\\" the most powerful single song i have ever heard, edging out \\"these arms of mine\\" by otis redding and \\"footsteps\\" by pearl jam.  i've been playing it all day, just sobbing like an damn idiot!!!  that doesn't happen very often.  thanks to the guys behind \\"rescue me\\" for having the brains and the good taste to feature such an amazing song in such a powerful way.  it was one of the best audio/video moments on a tv show that i have ever witnessed.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I waited 3 LONG years for this and it was worth every penny. I'm surprised to see complaints. Perhaps, people just need to give it some time and let it sink in. I liked it when I first heard it. I'm not disappointed. I can't wait to see what they do with their 4th album. Great job, Colplay!
B00005LQ04|5.0|this was my introduction to italian horror about five years ago and what an introduction it was. to be honest upon first viewing of Suspiria i found the Goblin score to be more chilling then the film itself .then after viewing on a big screen relized why. any box under 27\\" will not do this film justice! <br />suspiria is fantasy horror. you have to view it on a visceral level and not focus on logic. if you can let the images and music tell the story then you will love it. i would also mention that few filmakers can make gore beautiful and murder an art like Argento does in this picture. <br />to much to be said here. get the anchor bay double disc!
B0007OCG56|1.0|Brain circuits, reconnecting. Reality, resurfacing. Noises in head, stopping. Aaaaahhhhhhh!. Back to normal. Hopefully, the nightmares will stop.<br /><br />Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni, Mrs. David Duchovny. Let's face it, she isn't known for her work in movies.), is the...<br /><br />Uh, oh. Didn't get far. Brain circuits breaking free, disconnecting from the matter, won't let me remember Tea Leoni's God awful performance in \\"Spanglish\\", the newest film from writer - director James L. Brooks (\\"Broadcast News\\", \\"Terms of Endearment\\"). Move on to another topic before brain shuts down and the drool starts.<br /><br />Remember when James L. Brooks used to make really good films for adults? I know, its getting a little difficult, but make good films he did. \\"Terms of Endearment\\" and \\"Broadcast News\\" earned a bucket load of award nominations and awards for the various stars involved. Why? Because they were good films, with somewhat believable characters who did funny things or lived through very dramatic events. In the last decade, he has made three films. One of these was \\"As Good As It Gets\\" and sort of made people forget the debacle of \\"I'll Do Anything\\", his \\"musical without music\\" starring Nick Nolte. Then he made \\"Spanglish\\".<br /><br />...matriarch of an affluent family living in Brentwood. Recently downsized, she finds she has a lot of time on her hands and naturally decides to hire a housekeeper.<br /><br />Why won't the voices stop? What? Leoni's shrill voice is still rattling around in my head? What? Stop it, Tea. Leave my brain immediately. I need to finish the review in order to purge the demons...<br /><br />From the moment we meet Deborah, we realize that something is wrong with this woman; she talks a mile a minute, she never shuts up for anyone, she appears to be taking some sort of medication, perhaps Speed, but no mention is ever made of this. So what is the excuse for her to act like this? Even if she were taking medication, it would take a lot of explanation to make her behavior acceptable. Her daughter, Bernie (Sarah Steele), a slightly pudgy young girl with braces, makes a sandwich which everyone loves. Deborah takes a bite and practically swoons and then says \\"But you really don't need that\\", referring to her daughter's slightly pudgy state. Later, having returned from a warehouse sale, Deborah presents her daughter with bags full of new clothes. Excitedly, Bernie starts to try them on and realizes they are too small, all a size 8. \\"Don't worry, honey. You'll fit into them real soon.\\" Groan. The woman is a monster and shouldn't be allowed to raise these kids. Their son only appears in two or three scenes. Apparently, there was no dramatic material there.<br /><br />John Clasky (Adam Sandler) wakes up the next morning to find Flor (Paz Vega) cleaning the house. He didn't realize that Deborah -- the voices are ringing again -- had hired someone. John owns a small restaurant (modeled after the French Laundry, Thomas Keller's restaurant) which is receiving a lot of good praise. John learns that Flor speaks no English, but she does understand quite a bit. Flor is amazed to see how Deborah treats Bernie and takes all of the clothes, letting out hems and fixing them, to make them fit. This makes Flor Bernie's new best friend. Evelyn (Cloris Leachman), Deborah's mom, a former Jazz singer who lives with the family is intent on drinking as much wine during any given day as possible and providing sage advice to her daughter as she see fit. As the summer approaches, Deborah decides to rent a summer house in Malibu...<br /><br />Does not compute. Why would someone in Brentwood rent a summer home in Malibu? It doesn't make any sense. The weather is so much colder in Brentwood during the summer? If you are unfamiliar with the two, they are about ten to fifteen miles apart. Unfortunately, I am aware that people actually do this. Worse yet, as soon as they move, it becomes apparent that John will continue to commute to his restaurant. Business is booming because he just received four stars from the Times. The place is booked solid for four months. And Deborah, with her shrill, puffy face, crying all the time, screaming, or worse yet, talking a mile a minute, will continue to drive around, looking for something to occupy her time.<br /><br />Deborah insists Flor move into the summer house with them. Flor's daughter, Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), has to move in as well. Deborah immediately latches onto the young girl and treats her like a life size Barbie doll, making her the new `project'. She takes her to have her hair highlighted, to see a private school, etc., all without Flor's knowledge. Naturally, the first thing any of us would do is allow someone like Deborah to repeatedly influence our child, after watching the success she has had in her relationship with her own daughter, Bernie.<br /><br />Brain at critical stage. Meltdown imminent. Must purge it of all thoughts of  Leoni's performance. Must finish review. Quickly.<br /><br />It amazes me that anyone, anywhere thought Tea Leoni's performance was good, acceptable and film worthy; a combination of hysterics, crying, over-the-top acting and so much more. Maybe there are real people who act like this, but that doesn't mean that we have to pay to watch them for two hours. Always crying, talking hysterically, bossing people around, etc., etc. Considering how many people work on any given film it amazes me that someone, anyone didn't say \\"Ah...Mr. Brooks?\\". Brooks, Leoni, Sandler, the producers, the studio executives, David Duchovny, they all apparently thought that this performance was real and believable. It is easily one of the worst performances I have ever seen on film, or television, for that matter. In one scene, Deborah learns about the four star review of her husband's restaurant. This apparently excites her and she attacks him, pushing him into their bedroom, straddling him on the bed. John (Sandler) seems to enjoy the fact that she is taking control. \\"You don't even need me, do you?\\" he laughs. She rides him to her finish and then immediately begins crying and her face becomes puffy and sad. Oh my God. Every time she appeared on screen, I felt like poking my eardrums out, to save the torture.<br /><br />Brain levels lowering, don't really have to think about Leoni much anymore. Feeling better.<br /><br />The rest of \\"Spanglish\\" is acceptable. Billed as a \\"Comedy with a language all its own\\". It isn't very funny. Once of twice, I smiled, but I never laughed. Basically, everything they do is dramatic.<br /><br />It is also difficult to get past the contrived set-up for telling the story. An Admissions Officer at Princeton reads the admissions essay from Cristina, presumably 6 or 7 years later. In her essay, Cristina relates the events of her mother working for the Clasky family. How does Cristina know what the first meeting between her mother and Deborah was like? She wasn't there. How does she know how Deborah reacted to John's four star review? Clearly, she wasn't in their bedroom. It is difficult to imagine that someone would relate these stories, and others, to her. This is a sloppy, poorly executed method for telling the story.<br /><br />The production values in any Brooks' film will be of the highest standards. \\"Spanglish\\" doesn't disappoint there. Everything is crisp, clear, pretty. There is one exception. There are a couple of scenes with characters in cars, having a conversation as someone is driving. A couple of decades ago, these scenes would be shot in a studio, using a fake car, with the scenery projected behind the actors. In the last few decades, they have advanced this process, usually shooting in a real car, on the road. In \\"Spanglish\\", they have regressed. It is so obvious that a significant portion of these scenes were shot in a studio making me question why? Think of the Roger Moore James Bond films. Whenever he had to jump out of a plane, the close-ups would always havehis hair moving in an unnatural way. This is because he was shot in front of a blue screen and the scenery was added later. They weren't able to make his hair flow freely. Apparently, they weren't able to make Leoni's hair flow freely either.<br /><br />Oh, oh. Mentioned Leoni. Brain levels back at medium, rising, rising. Must purge of all of her memories.<br /><br />After Flor's daughter moves in, Deborah begins to manipulate her and Flor, because she thinks Flor's daughter is beautiful. You see, she doesn't think her own daughter is beautiful. Now she has the daughter she always wanted. Flor's daughter is accepted at Bernie's school, Deborah gives her an expensive necklace on her first day, buys her books for her, insists that she invite her friends over to their house for a sleepover. Who thought this was an interesting, believable, watchable story? Someone was very misguided. I'm looking at you, Mr. Brooks.<br /><br />Every so often an actor or actress will give the performance of their career, overshadowing all others. The film becomes \\"Their Film\\". They earn all of the notice. Tea Leoni has done that in \\"Spanglish\\". It doesn't matter that Paz Vega gives a very good, believable performance as Flor, it doesn't matter that Adam Sandler does some good, if unspectacular work, it doesn't matter that Cloris Leachman is even in the film. The film is all about Leoni. And not in a good way. Her performance is so bad, she creates a black hole sucking all of the other actors in.<br /><br />Hopefully, they will get out in time and move on to other projects. Hopefully, Tea will take some acting classes and learn the art of subtlety. Hopefully, I will make a million dollars tomorrow. We can all dream.<br /><br />Aaaahhh, brain levels back to normal.

B0001RVTXO|5.0|I can only recommend this album for people who have never heard of the Pixies.  For Pixies fans, there's no point to having this compilation.  It adds nothing new.  For people who have no idea who the Pixies are, this album will open your eyes to a whole new world of music-- edgy, melodic, psychotic, and beautiful.  You won't be disappointed.
1400032717|4.0|There's something utterly charming about this short novel about an autistic boy who decides to investigate the death of his neighbors dog and ends up discovering the truth about his own family life. I loved the compassion and cleverness that Haddon uses to paint his characters and challenge our misconceptions about what is what. An elegant, witty and delightful novel that can be read in a seating.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Fred Durst's brand of rap/rock does pretty much the exact opposite of Rage Against The Machine's. Instead of mixing the best of both genres, as they do, he takes the absolute worst from each.  So for all the teens who love the amorality, endless repetition of stale beats, and trendiness found in modern rap music, but who wish it was more mindlessly aggressive like modern metal, here you go. It so completely lacks substance that you'll be sick to death of it within a few listens, but that's O.K. because you have the attention span of a goldfish and anything more sophisticated would be wholly beyond your comprehension. <br /> <br />But I digress. The reason I'm writing this review is to share my anger about the first real song on this album, \\"Hot Dog,\\" in which Durst showcases his magnificent songwriting abilities by using the term \\"f****d up\\" to describe everything that pops into his tiny brain. (Imagine ICP's \\"F**k the World,\\" only not funny.) Suddenly, during one of the song's pathetic verses, Durst does something that genuinely surprised me. He says, \\"A Nine Inch Nail gets knocked the f**k out,\\" clearly an attack on Trent Reznor, probably the most innovative recording artist of the '90s. <br /> <br />Now, I don't know how this \\"celebrity feud\\" between Durst and Reznor got started, I just know it's pretty laughable.  I mean, Reznor isn't really in Durst's weight class, so to speak. It's kind of like George Dubya Bush calling Albert Einstein unintelligent. Here's one guy who's famously untalented and fake attacking someone who basically reinvented rock and brought industrial music out of the shadows and into the light. <br /> <br />I also liked that Durst appropriates the chorus of NIN's hit single \\"Closer,\\" changes some of the words, and uses it as \\"Hot Dog\\"'s chorus. Obviously, this is intended as yet another \\"diss\\" against Trent, but come on. If you're getting into an argument where your musical originality is bound to come into question, why stick a reminder that you can't write your own songs right into the track?
0141301155|5.0|My absolute favorite as a child and newly beloved by my kids.  ONE CAUTION . . . the illustrations in the current version by Quentin Blake are highly inferior to the ones in the original printing by Schindelman.  The originals convey Dahl's twisted, almost gothic vision much more richly.  These illustrations (and I think some accompanying text) are distinctly non-PC vis. the Oompa-Loompas, but, especially if you are using this as a \\"read-to-me\\" book, this actually provides a teachable moment.  Definitely get this book for your kids, but, for a more fulfilling experience, seek out a used version pre-1988 or so.
B000001FO4|5.0|Cinderella followed its debut Night Songs with Long Cold Winter, which featured some improved instrumentation, distinct songs instead of the same sound throughout, and a more blues-based song infused with their usual metal.  The opening \\"Falling Apart/Bad Seamstress Blues,\\" has some classic acoustic blues before launching into metal blues in the second part, including some superior electric blues guitar.  As in their first album, they put forth a sound that should've put Warrant, Firehouse, and Winger on alert to what metal should've been.<br /><br />The heavy rocking \\"Gypsy Road\\" is this album's \\"Shake Me.\\"  Strangely enough, the video for this song was released before \\"Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone),\\" as that song charted first.  As it turns out, this was released as a single after the success of the first three singles.  It peaked at #51, and I put this to the order when it was released.  Why not release it as the first single as it was in the UK?<br /><br />Probably because of the success of pop-metal bands doing ballads; Cinderella's first single (and second video) \\"Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)\\" bettered its previous ballad, \\"Nobody's Fool,\\" by one place, peaking at #12.  It starts as a piano ballad before going full force with the guitars and synths to give it a soaring effect, of some hope left to mend what was sundered.<br /><br />The next single was \\"The Last Mile,\\" which falls into the metal blues category.  This hard-driving song reached #36, which would've signaled them to hold off on singles, but they came out with yet another one, the mid-paced \\"Coming Home\\" which made it to #20.  Some country inflections on the mellower parts give evidence that they just didn't go for straight ahead metal.  A definite asset to this album.<br /><br />As for the rest, it's mostly hard-driving numbers such as \\"Second Wind,\\" that push this album on further heights than Night Songs.  \\"If You Don't Like It\\" shows a defiant stance on lifestyle a la Billy Joel's \\"My Life\\" but with some attitude.  \\"If you don't like it, I don't care\\" becomes an anthem against that elite exploitative 9-5 set.  \\"Fire and Ice\\" is another song on a predatory woman, with its \\"shake for me ooo yea\\" a reminder of their first single, \\"Shake Me.\\"<br /><br />The title track sees them going into slow heartfelt electric blues mode, with Tom Keifer's banshee-like vocals strangely not out-of-place, showing that Clapton and ZZ Top didn't have the sole monopoly on blues-based rock.<br /><br />Long Cold Winter also benefits from extra drumming assistance from Cozy Powell, who took Carl Palmer's place in ELP, and Denny Carmassi of Heart, as well as session percussionist Paulinho da Costa.  And given that Keifer and bassist Tom Bittingham were two of three co-producers showed that this time, they were ready to break new ground.  A definite improvement over Night Songs, Long Cold Winter will warm those who are 80's metal fans, whether rediscovering or discovering this for the first time.la Billy Joel's \\"My Life\\" but with some attitude.  \\"If you don't like it, I don't care\\" becomes an anthem against that elite exploitative 9-5 set.  \\"Fire and Ice\\" is another song on a predatory woman, with its \\"shake for me ooo yea\\" a reminder of their first single, \\"Shake Me.\\" <br /> <br />The title track sees them going into slow heartfelt electric blues mode, with Tom Keifer's banshee-like vocals strangely not out-of-place, showing that Clapton and ZZ Top didn't have the sole monopoly on blues-based rock. <br /> <br />Long Cold Winter also benefits from extra drumming assistance from Cozy Powell, who took Carl Palmer's place in ELP, and Denny Carmassi of Heart, as well as session percussionist Paulinho da Costa.

0812580346|4.0|This was the kind of book, that you had to really concentrate on to understand what is going on.  I found that i had to go back every now and then to keep up with the character.  Good reading and a good book to take with you on a long flight or sitting in a waiting room.
034537410X|5.0|This book is written by the pioneer of modern lucid dream scholorship. Unfortunately, it is often found in the \\"New Age\\" section of bookstores, and this is misleading. It is a scientific book written about an entirely practicable and enlightening area of human consciousness. If you have ever had a dream in which you realized you were dreaming (most people have at least once), you will be delighted to know that you can learn to have this experience at will. <br />The book gives a good overview of how dreaming works. It provides a number of techniques for lucid dream induction, prolongation, and activities to try once the lucid state has been achieved.  <br />In practice, it is much more difficult to actually perform the exercises recommended by LaBerge, but this does not detract from the usefulness of the book. Lucid dreaming is a hard-earned skill, but the rewards are worth the effort many times over. <br />This is a one-stop resource for anyone interested in practicing lucid dreaming. Highly recommended.
B00003CWN3|4.0|Hilary Swank won the first of her two Best Actress Oscars for her brave performance as Brandon Teena/nee Teena Brandon in this tragic film based on a true story.  Cross gendering performances can often be very unbelievable (e.g., Barbra Streisand's YENTL), and although there are moments when Hilary can't hide being Hilary, she is amazingly convincing as a somewhat effeminate young man who wins the heart of doe eyed Lana (a brilliant Chloe Sevigny).  Whether one can condone Brandon's deceptive life, one can't help but be disgusted in the tragic end she so undeservedly comes to.  Peter Skarsgaard, a highly underappreciated actor, is chilling in his role of John, Lana's sometime boyfriend who goes bananas when he finds out who Brandon really is..or isn't.  Jeanette Arnette as Lana's mother is also quite good in a difficult role.  While certainly painful to watch by its tragic conclusion, BOYS DON'T CRY is nonetheless a touching look at an outsider who just wants to find her place in a confusing world.
0345410025|4.0|For anyone interested in accelerated learning, this book will be useful. I know there are several other books on this topic available, but I have not read many of them, so I do not have much basis for comparison; however, I am confident in saying that this is a good start. <br />The authors do have the naive assumption that once you learn something, you will never forget it. All memories are subject to decay, no matter how well they are learned, contrary to popular belief. All memories must be reviewed periodically for them to remain fresh in the memory. That being said, visualizing things tends to plant them more firmly in your memory; you just have to realize that you cannot remember something for life by using a memory technique on it if you do not subject it to periodic review. <br />Also, the authors recommend using their techniques for all learning. I disagree here, as I don't think it is necessary to use special techniques for something you are able to remember without a problem. The techniques only become necessary in certain situations, such as: memorizing lists of facts; memorizing large amounts of material in a short period of time; memorizing strange or difficult-to-visualize facts and concepts; memorizing long speeches; and memorizing items that just won't stick to your memory, for whatever reason. <br />Also, the techniques are more difficult to learn and practice than the authors claim. It takes serious effort to master and practice memory techniques. The authors have been using the techniques for years, and they probably don't realize the challenge that will be posed to students new to the world of enhanced memory. <br />All of the criticism in this review may make it seem like I didn't like the book, but I thought it was excellent. It is a must for any serious learner. Recommended.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|I have to admit it, I love Dido's music, her first album No Angel was brilliant, and Life for Rent second album really grew on me and is a favorite on my playlist. <br /> <br />This concert CD is a pleasure to watch, her concert performance is inspired, with just enough changes/tweaks to her songs that even though I've practically memorized her songs, it was new and refreshing. The picture quality was a bit soft played on 100\\" projector screen, but it kind of works in light of her musical style. The bonus of an Audio CD in the package is great, and makes this a great value. The sound quality of the CD is decent for a concert live CD. It's not the clearest sounding live CD, but the overall tonally balance is listenable. <br /> <br />Dido's performance was great on this DVD, and watching her performance makes me love her music even more. A must for a Dido fan.
B0000067L2|5.0|This is THE must have album for the classic rock fan.  Undoubtedly Clapton at his best.  If I were stuck on a deserted island and had to pick 5 albums to take with me, this would be #1 with a bullet.  So if you still reading this this review, then you not following my advice.  Buy this album, right now!!!!
0385495323|5.0|This book is about a subject that doesn't sound too interesting or obvious at first. But Simon Singh describes and analyzes the history of coding in a very captivating and understandable way, the result of both thorough research and funny anecdotes he found along the way. <br /> <br />He starts with the earliest known accounts of coding in ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome at around 450 BCE where this new ability lead to some decisive military victories. As well as to treason and intrigue in love matters of course. The methods used at that time are well explained and amazingly easy to reproduce if you know how they work. At the time most didn't of course , so the secrets were well kept. Until up to around the year 800 CE when Muslim scholars took coding to the next level and dominated the field for 400 years. Then the Europeans woke up from their slumber and this new interest in cryptography and cryptoanalysis culminated in the 'chiffre indchiffrable' (the unbreakable cipher). But it was only a question of time when it would be broken and so it was indeed in the 19th century. Which meant a big victory for the cryptoanalysts over the cryptographs. And cryptography was temporarily shattered. Until the early 20th century when technical and mechanical advances let it rise from the ashes. This also decisively influenced, and shortened, the two World Wars. Especially the story of the Enigma machine is mind-blowing. There then was a new lull after WW2 but the Information age brought new interest and needs which resulted in the current Internet encryption standard PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). Finally Singh then briefly explains how Quantum cryptography could work and what it would mean for the future. <br /> <br />That's about it. As I've said, it's very readable, enlightening and entertaining though there are parts where it gets a bit too theoretical but you can skip those pages without missing too much. It doesn't prevent understanding what follows. It should yet be noted that one interesting, somewhat off-beat, chapter shows how cryptoanalytical methods were used to decode the hieroglyphs and 'Linear B'. <br /> <br />So, if after reading this book you think that you've got real code cracker skills, then you might want to try to solve the \\"Beale Papers\\" mystery ... Happy treasure hunting! ;)
B00082ZS5W|5.0|This is an excellent DVD. I have all of Dido's Cd's. But I have to say seeing her life is just great. She harmonizes great with her band. And she comes across very honest and alive. Great interaction with the audience. I collect music DVD's and this is the first DVD I watched two times in a row. I love it.
0802130208|5.0|Anyone who is looking for that gem, searching far and wide to find that one book that must be read: look no further! This is one of the best books I've ever read, even better than Catch 22 and Kurt Vonnegut's The Sirens of Titan. <br /> <br />If you're tired of books being called \\"hilarious romps\\" when they rarely make you fall out of your chair laughing, then find refuge in A Confederacy of Dunces. You won't regret it. (And a keep a dictionary handy.)
B0006L16N8|3.0|Remember when rock groups would alter their style and take chances, exploring thier abilities and taking rock music in new directions? Like Led Zeplin? (Houses of the Holy) <br /> <br /> <br />I also anticipated this release, and was also hoping for a SONIC UPGRADE as previous CD'S were poor recordings that delivered a harsh reality. But you overlooked the poor recording because the music was so good. <br /> <br />My recent upgrade to the Theta Digital Dreadnaught II amp improved the early recordings somewhat, but Steely Dan AJA quality they weren't. <br /> <br />SO IMHO, this new highly hyped release offfers not much more than I already have with the 2 superior previous recordings. <br /> <br />I hear less rock and more whinning in this release, surely to inspire another Mad TV parody. Sorry CP fans, I say what I feel, not what I think you want to hear. <br /> <br />IMHO, one or two good songs do not save a CD, if its good, its good ALL the way through. <br /> <br />D
B00082ZS5W|3.0|I like everything I've heard by Dido. She has a great, smoky voice and all of her songs performed here are deeply beautiful. It's good to finally see how she is in a live setting. Unfortunately, the widescreen image is heavily processed with a soft focus throughout, which I detest. Still, she looks terrific and the audio quality is generally good. Mmmm, and I especially love her performance here of \\"Take My Hand\\" - I wouldn't mind being her \\"microphone\\" during it, ohhhhhh baby.....     BEWARE!!! ATTENTION!!! READ THIS!! - DO NOT LOAD THE LIVE MUSIC CD INTO YOUR PC. IT CONTAINS SUNNCOMM / MEDIAMAX SONYBMG ROOTKIT SPYWARE, WHICH WILL SCREW YOUR SYSTEM UP! DAMN THESE COMPANIES TO HELL!
B00005AQE8|5.0|I got this when it came out, so I dont have the enhanced or remastered one.. but I bet it's practically the same.  This CD set a precedent for the future of rap.. I believe it was one of the first rap double albums.  Plus this was his first album after coming out of jail so you know he was going to come back strong with all kinds of lyrics about how no one can stop him (ie: Picture Me Rollin') and I believe he put this album together in a really short time, just went to the studio and layed it down.  I'm glad this was the first Tupac CD I ever bought, because it is the best one I own, and I own all of his cds except for 2pacalypse now.  Not only does he have a great sound with his voice, but the beats are great.. as evident with the singles How Do U Want it and California Love.  The only thing about this cd is that you don't get the California Love original version, the remix is on the cd.  His lyrics are always great.. and I especially like the messages in Wonder Why They Call U B**** and Life Goes On.  This CD has it all.. songs you can party to (one of my favorite lines- \\"break out the champagne glasses and motherf***** condoms!\\"), songs you can relate to, songs that touch on issues in society... it's a must for anyone who likes hip hop.
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|Definitely one of my favorite Scorsese films, Casino FINALLY gets it's due. Filmed in Super 35, it's never looked better than here. It's been a long wait from the days of laserdisc and even the original dvd release, but it's been worth it. A film like this has dialogue so crisp you want to read along, but unfortunately it is NOT closed-captioned, only subtitled and SPARSELY at that, not detailed; a minor complaint, but if you want to savor every word spoken, it's a little disappointing. Would love to have had a full-length commentary featuring De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese sitting down to talk through this but the track that is included is still very good. Excellent disc; would have been worth picking up again for the improved film transfer.
B00000055E|4.0|Maybe I don't listen to the others enough, but this album is my favorite/the best album released after tupac's death (not including Makaveli because that had new material he recorded just for that CD).  I listen to Disc 2 a lot more, Fake Ass B****** and Do For Love are two of my favorite Tupac songs.. FAB is just funny and it's a great diss on fake people.. which I'm sure everyone can relate to.  I always laugh at the end when he describes a fake person listening to the song.  Do For Love is a nice slower song.. if you like R&B you'd like this song.  It has one of the guys from Blackstreet singing the chorus.  I also like the hip hop version of I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto much better.. plus I think most people would recognize the lyrics from this song because they were later used/recycled in the popular song Changes.. if you liked that song.. that song is average compared to this one.. they did a much better job mixing this song and did poorly with changes, but I guess that's my opinion..so give it a listen and see for yourself.  If you pick up any of Tupac's later CDs this should be one of the first.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The best concert ever! The Indian performance is inspiring. What a thrill to see (and hear) so many guitarists and drummers playing together. It was electrifying. It was so good, I watched it a few times. And everytime my boyfriend asks what DVD we're watching, I'm always quick to offer this DVD title.
B00000AFDW|5.0|I Really did enjoy this album. The Best track hands down is Ace's \\"into the void\\". The rest have varying  degrees of KISS-ability. By no stretch is it a good KISS album; more than likely only the fans will REALLY  like this album. Which is unfortunate. <br />If you are able to get the release with a CD, a 3D video, and the 3D  glasses, I think thats the best experience of this album. Its a big pity that a full set of Videos for the album were not done. They could have done a great Multimedia event, since KISS is basically a product of their shows, so the music is the soundtrack to the theatre. <br />It is a Nice collectors CD if you enjoyed the band from the early days, but outside of that, if you are not a fan, its probably ( as much as I hate to say this) an item to avoid. <br />My 5 stars are because it works great in bringing back some good memories.
B00000DCHI|1.0|Let's be brutally honest for a moment.  This music is very cheesy.  More specifically, its melodramatic, sentimental, and irritatingly precious.  Worse still are Joel's pretensions toward poetry and his tendency to lionize his own artistic talents.  As easily as these melodies can lull the listener into a stupified ersatz bliss, they can just as easily dull the ear to much more challenging forms (eg jazz or classical).  This is the worst kind of commodified, commercialized cheese, spewed forth not by some faceless record company (that would be forgivable) but by the singer/songwriter himself!  Billy Joel succesfully did to rock and roll what twinkie did to foodstuffs, what the A-team did to theater and what Vanila Ice did to hip hop.  If Billy Joel is languishing in some \\"Hell\\" of adult soft-rock contemporary music as the official review states, then its a self-imposed exile by one of that bleak wind-blown plane's arch demons himself.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Honestly this is their best album so far, but with the little progress they've made so far they only have about 2 albums left in them. None of these songs are bad but i have to say that the screaming gets old. It's through a feud between fans that i found another band by the name of Mushroomhead who you may also enjoy.(songs eternal and mother machine gun.)
014028009X|4.0|Bridget Jones is a woman who is so ordinary that she is extraordinary. And therein lies her appeal: Helen Fielding has created a character that practically every woman can relate with. Bridget's problems--a lack of appreciation in her job, an often-disappointing love life, a never-ending struggle with her weight--are the problems of a tremendous variety of women at some point in their lives. The fact that Bridget is a highly relatable character, however, is not enough to make her compelling; it is the manner in which Bridget faces her problems--with flair and yet an utter lack of grace--that makes \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" so hard to put down. <br /> <br />I must praise Fielding for the way that she styles her characters. All of the major characters in the book--Bridget, Mark Darcy, and Daniel Cleaver--fit a specific type: the everywoman, the gruff-yet-lovable romantic hero, the rogue. None of these characters, however, fall into the one-dimensionality that generally curses stock characters. All three feel real and true, yet they have enough general characteristics that the reader is able to take Bridget, Darcy, and Daniel as placeholders for real-life acquaintances. <br /> <br />I do think that \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" contains a few minor flaws worth noting. First, although the major characters feel fleshed out, the minor characters--particularly Bridget's group of friends, Sharon, Jude, and Tom--aren't as able to break free of the stock character curse.  <br /> <br />Second, a large part of the charm of \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" is that Fielding throws Bridget into situations that are ridiculous; how Bridget handles this makes her who she is. However, Fielding sometimes pushes Bridget into circumstances that go beyond ridiculousness and enter the territory of the absurd. In those instances, Fielding undermines her own character. Bridget is fascinating because, as an everywoman, she enters situations as a real-life person, but as the hero of the book, she proceeds to dealwith them in a way that most women only dream of doing. In order for this to work, the events in the book must remain grounded in reality. Thankfully Fielding largely avoids this pitfall in \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\"-though she walks right into it in \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.\\" <br /> <br />However, as I said before, these flaws are relatively minor. Overall, \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" is a witty, engaging book centering on a very memorable character. I have read the book through a good half-dozen times, not to mention the numerous instances that I've read a few pages at random, in search of a quick pick-me-up-which \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" never fails to provide.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I didn't use to listen to a lot of music really.  The music I had was enough to last me it seemed.  I was then introduced to launchcast radio.  I was a very big System of a Down fan and so they highlighted my station for a long time along with Evanescence.  While listening to music that launch thought I would like I kept hearing this song \\"The Noose.\\"  The more I heard it the more in love with the song I became.  I eventually asked my husband if he had ever heard of a band called A Perfect Circle, that the lead singer was just amazing.  He then told me that his name was Maynard and that he was also the lead singer of Tool. <br />I've been obsessed ever since.  I first bought Mer de Noms.  I didn't think anything could top that album.  But then I received The Thirteenth Step and I couldn't stop listening to it.  The more I listened to Maynard sing, the more curious about Tool I became.  So I ended up buying all the Tool albums and all the A Perfect Circle albums.  I have to say that my favorite of the A Perfect Circle albums is Thirteenth Step.  EMotive is very disappointing.  Not because of the singing, but the songs are only covers so in my opinion they lack the depth of what A Perfect Circle stands for.   <br />The highlights of this album are definately \\"The Package\\", \\"The Noose\\", \\"Blue\\", \\"Pet\\", and \\"Gravity.\\" <br />Now Tool and A Perfect Circle dominate my station. <br />My sister has recently accused me of being a \\"Maynard Cult\\" because I go around preaching to anyone that will listen to buy all the Tool and A Perfect Circle albums.  So um...go buy them all (except maybe EMotive).  Anyone that likes a song that actually MEANS something, shouldn't be disappointed.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|I agree the ending leaves a LOT to be desired, but even the ending can't ruin the real meat and potatoes of this film, and in it's own silly way somehow actually works.  <br /> <br />I must emphasize that this film is as much about nostalgia for me, as it is about a simply good family film. As a child I loved Sci-fi, and this was one of the films that truly captured my imagination. I cannot look at a truly starry night without almost hearing the harmonica music Ethan Hawke's character plays on the rooftop, and knowing exactly what that character was thinking and feeling at that moment. Beyond awe, beyond wonder, beyond hope. <br /> <br />As I child spending my summer in upstate New York, occasionally the sky would be so clear you could see something akin to what he saw, so deep so vast, so wonderful.  <br /> <br />I could also see a seriously good sequel being made to this film if the powers that be ever considered it. One that could wipe away the goofiness of the ending of the original and replace it with a more grown up ending. Sadly however I'm sure the magic, dreamlike quality of a movie set in the 80's will never be recaptured. To say nothing of the childlike wonder the movie inspires in me even today.  <br /> <br />So needless to say I'm more than a fan of this film, one of these days I'm going to clear out the garage, find a tilt a whirl, and build my own version of the ship, even if it doesn't have force field bubble technology, it will be one hell of a conversation piece.  <br /> <br />Anyone who was of the age at the time of this movies release and likes sci-fi, and doesn't mind the goofy ending, will enjoy this film, and nobody that I know who recalls this movie would ever say it wasn't a wonderful film. Maybe not quite on a par with the Dark crystal, or as popular as the last star fighter, or Flight of the Navigator, but this film has a magic that is undeniable. A magic that's certainly due in no small part to the great casting of the main trio. I recommend this film highly, Nuff said.
B00002DEGZ|5.0|Whereas I consider only Mozart's six latest symphonies really important works, I count 14 of his piano concertos to the core of his large output; no. 9, nos. 14-25 and no. 27; which makes 2/3 of this material essential. A complete box of the concertos is therefore something to acquire. This box is cheaper now, and a really bargain. I don't like Gardiner when it comes to Bach; but I like him very much when it comes to Mozart, and even Beethoven. Bilson is wonderful.
0060516402|5.0|A pathbreaking book that outlines how to build landmark companies that stand the test of time. Collins and Porras asked themselves a crucial question: 'What makes the truly exceptional companies different from the other companies?' - by answering which, the authors have gone beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and newfound fads to discover timeless qualities that have and consistently will distinguish outstanding companies. They provide inspiration to entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies. What is striking about this book is that though an academic treatise, it is superbly written and an exciting read. You could fall asleep on most thesis but this one kept me turning the pages despite being sleepy from a long day's work. I would recommend it to anyone who is serious not about making a quick buck, but about building a business that lasts.
B000068OCS|5.0|Its hard to add much new to what has been written about this film. Music and image are perfectly combined. The musical score is brilliantly conceived, beginning, as do the images, very deliberately and picking up speed and density as we move from prehistory to the bleak, spectacular landscapes of the southwest and the urban sprawl beyond. Humans pour up and out of escalators as clouds over the sides of canyons. In the end, over elegiac organ music, lonely, broken humans are juxtaposed to a gigantic rocket launch that ends in cataclysmic failure.<br /><br />After not having seen the movie in over twenty years, I was moved to tears and awed by the insistent build-up of drama and tension.
0553213105|5.0|When you finish this book-you'll sigh* (I did) and then you'll be stuck remembering all the characters and how you recognize them in your present relationships (Lizzy's dad was one of my favorites) -- you'll find yourself thinking about Jane Austen and wondering what she was like... so you'll talk about her and find that EVERYONE loves her.  and then your neighbor will lend you all the Austen movies (that BBC one will steal your entire afternoon!)--and she'll actually have a whole bunch of literary criticisms and Austen biographies...and you'll become obsessed.  (I did)...hope you are able to take care of yourselves through it all.  stay hydrated.
B000000OSE|3.0|Truth be known, no record in the history of music was as anticipated as this release, as well as its sister record, back in 1991.  Sadly, the commercial appeal and validity, thus the overall stock, of the record has suffered unimaginably since that time period, in a whirlwind of new bands, more uplifting sounds, a more level-headed approach, and more talented musicians.  (Surprising if one were to listen to the ramblings of one William Axl Rose of Indiana.)   <br /> <br />These days the mere hype machine doesn't always do a record justice or guarantee classic-rock status or instant sales.  Blame not the Internet or other diversions, for in their time Guns 'n Roses (or is it Guns n' Roses??)  were truly the cream of the crop in terms of commercial viability and drawing ticket sales to astronomical proportions.  The sounds of both \\"Illusion\\" records bring forth a blur of wailing and crash-course guitar work that went overboard in their need to accentuate the world of their mark - in plain terms, the kids might have related at the time, but where was all of it going?  All one has to do is watch G 'n R's \\"Behind the Music\\" special to see what folly the whole enterprise was.  Axl was practically a nonexistent entity, despite his claim that he had leadership.  Slash lent more, musically, to the unfounded project, but was so warped in a cloud of inhalants and mixtures that his services were largely unnoticed and scant.  <br /> <br />The ones who left G 'n R may yet prove to bet the ULTIMATE WINNERS, as Velvet Revolver pushes their brand of G 'n R-esque guitars upon the masses, only to stumble in what may yet be a repeat of said past unfortunate experiences.  Axl lays claim to presently be producing the world's top album in \\"Chinese Democracy,\\" at which time the land of China might actually be practicing full-fledged democracy by the time the record hits stores in Axl's postmortem last-stance departure. <br /> <br />In short, the \\"Illusions\\" may have conqured in times of yore, but these days the sounds ring pathetically hollow. <br /> <br />Hey, by the way, does anyone know when Halen might be reuniting with Roth?  Word has it Roth is searching his soul to become a trained paramedic, but how could he pass up the glory that IS Van Halen? <br /> <br />Keep me posted!!!!!!!!!!!!
1400032717|3.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about.  The book has a good premise and on the surface appears to be interesting, but once you've been hooked in, you don't get the story that was described on the back of the book.  I liked reading about Christopher's personality and his quirks, and I liked hearing about his investigation, but other than that, it bored me to tears and I found myself skimming through much of the book.  If you want to learn about mathematics and other scientific information, this book would be great for you.  Otherwise, save your money.  I had to put the book down mid-way through so I could devote my time to a good book.  I think this is just getting a good wrap because people are jumping on the bandwagon and thinking it's some great intellectual insight into an autistic child, and while I can see where that's coming from, it was a boring read.
B0009PVZWI|1.0|I'm a big Foo fan, but man, what a disappointment!!  You'd think with all the time they had and with two discs at their disposal there would be something redeeming on this album, but no such luck.  Disc 1 everything sounds the same.  Disc 2 things sound a little different, but completely boring.  Hopefully I'll get $4 for this overpriced junk at the record exchange.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|The first time I heard this album, it brought tears to my eyes.  Cash's cover of \\"We'll Meet Again\\" totally changes the meaning of the song for me.  Until now, it had always brought to mind the end of Dr. Strangelove and seemed saccarine sweet.  Cash found an underlying pathos to the song, and the reunion he references is in Heaven (or whatever comes post-death).  Virtually every song on the album would be the best song on any other album.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I was very impressed with this move -- especially the phantom.  I couldn't see Christine being attracted to a disfigured lip and a mask.  Gerry Butler really brings out sexual appeal into this role, and is not a bad singer either.  His singing is not as great as Raoul, but it's not meant to be.  Raoul's singing is perfect, because he's portrayed that way, but the Phantom sings with such passion.  My favorite part was \\"Point of no return\\".  I thought that GB did an excellent job of seduction -- I gave in....several times.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|\\"Tasty\\".  That is how I would describe this album in one word, \\"Tasty\\".  What is not to like about these groove heavy songs that clutch has been renowned for over the last 15 years.  Neil tells the best stories with the best changes in inflection for effect.  Dan and Jean-Paul rock one of the tightest rythm sections in the entire rock world.  Last but certainly not least, Tim lays down some of the best guitar grooves I've ever heard.  These guys are masters at their craft and it shows on every song that they put out.  I also, really enjoyed the addition of the keyboards in this album.  It gives the music an added classic feel at just the right spots.   <br />As an earlier reviewer put it, these guys deserve some much deserved credit for the quality of work they have produced, as well as the great live shows that they perform.  <br />I hope to enjoy new music from these guys for many more years to come.  Long live Clutch!
B0000041XX|5.0|This cd is a must-have for anyone interested in opera - or beautiful singing. And when you're at it - why don't buy the dvd from the concert? It will make you appreciate the cd even more.     First of all I have to comment on the editorial review of this cd.  I felt the reviewer is \\"belittling\\" Jos Carreras here by saying he's one step behind the big brothers and his singing isn't as captivating as that of the big boys.....?!?!? Of course I can only speak for myself, but I feel she's way out of line. And I'm starting to wonder if she's been listening to the cd at all? In my opinion you have to be dead not to be touched by his rendition of \\"Lamento di Federico\\" and \\"L'improvviso\\". If anybody can deliver a line it has to be Carreras. When it comes to his interpretation of \\"Granada\\" even conductor Zubin Mehta was gobsmacked. Watching the dvd you can see him putting down his baton and applauding. He even steps down from his podium to hug Jos.    I have to say I'm not too keen on the two other tenors, although I have to admit I loved Pavarotti's \\"Torna a Surriento\\" and \\"Rondine al nido\\". The thing about Pavarotti is that he has a great singing technique and he's also in possession of this \\"push-button\\" which make him sing a lot of high notes, but that alone isn't enough to stir emotion.     As for Domingo, even if he's giving it all in every song, and his \\"No puede ser\\" was great,I think he's a bit too much on the nasal side. He's okay when they all perform together, but his \\"E lucevan le stelle\\" is sending shivers down my spine - and not of delight. I'm practically unable to sit still and listen to his solos. If you really want \\"fire and pain\\" you should check out Carreras in the Tosca-recording from -80, or his recording from -76. It's really breathtaking and I promise you'll end up in tears!      At the end of this concert the three tenors perform a medley together. Their voices blend perfectly and it's powerful to listen to them giving it all. A lot of people are talking about their mis-pronounciations. I for one, think it only adds to the charm of the performers. Pavarotti has some problems with the English songs (okay, big problems..), Domingo stumbles in the words in the beginning of \\"Wien Wien nur du allein\\", and (this you'll see in the dvd) in the same song Carreras is actually reading the text from a piece of paper as he's singing and his facial expressions when getting his head around the German words are really hilarious. O sole mio as an encore is fabulous when Pavarotti pushes his button and shakes out all his high notes.... And I love it when the two other join forces and repeat his stunt to perfection.    All in all this is a wonderful album. And well worth 5 stars.... Jos alone gets 10 stars!!!
B00005JKZU|5.0|Orcs are everywhere. Frodo Baggins continues his quest to destroy the ring. That's all that's going on. It's cool. Cooler than I thought it would be. It is a follow-up from \\"Fellowship of The Ring.\\" THAT was awesome to begin with.  You have to see that first to know whaaaatttt'ssss happenin'. MMM-KAY?  Sure, there are problems. There always are problems in this trilogy. I just love fantasy movies. I cannot think of more than 2 people who don't like films like this. Some who like it still occasionally fall asleep. You know it's NOT THAT boring. Classic series.
B00003CXI1|3.0|\\"Harry Potter\\" is one of the biggest money making machines in the world.  Later this year we will all be graced with a new book from author J.K. as well as the next cinematic chapter directed by Brit Mike Newell.   And the phenomenon can be traced back to when Rowling published the first book in the series and when helplessly mainstream director Christopher Columbus took the reins for the first movie.  Columbus, best known for the \\"Home Alone\\" films and \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\" beat out a slew of other directors to get the job, most likely after Spielberg withdrew his interest.  As a result, the film is artistically hit and miss.  While the film is esquisitely designed, shot and edited, \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" comes up somewhat anemic in compelling dramatics.  In an attempt to please die hard Potter fans, Columbus and writer Steve Kloves (Wonder Boys) try to cram in as much of the book's numerous plot strands and details into the films' overlong 150-minute-plus running time as possible, losing narrative kinetics and often bogging down the film in one forgettable passage after another. They sometimes neglect to focus on the characters that Rowling so cannily imagined and on the themes of the story that made the tale of wizards, witches and a demonic dark lord hit so close to home. <br /> <br />With so much lacking in the film, it should have keeled over as one bloated, extravagent mess.  But the film has one saving grace that salvages it and makes it somewhat endearing: dead on casting.  It would be hard to imagine a better cast of unknowns and british film and theater vets to bring the Potter legend to life.  Previously unheard of Daniel Radcilffe gives off earnest charm as you Harry, a young, inexperienced savior of the world who is blissfully unaware of what awiats him later in life.  Emma Watson is delightful as the helplessly brainy Hermione Granger, always her nose in a book.  And Rupert Grint is a riot as the well-meaning but a little bumbling Ron Weasly and puts a true sense of humor into his role.  And the supporting cast, what a roster.  Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and many others look almost too comfortable in their roles as teachers, professors and groundskeepers at the fabled Hogwartz school for witchcraft and wizardry.  They make the complex art of acting seem effortless and Columbus should be thankful.  The execution of the story may be flawed, but the casting is damn near perfect, saving \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" from fan derision.
1400032717|5.0|I found myself unable to put down Mark Haddon's beautiful, moving and quirky book about an autistic adolescent trying to solve a murder mystery in his neighborhood.  15-year-old Christopher was described so well that I felt as though I was literally seeing the world through his eyes.  Using the first-person tense was particularly effective in enabling us to get inside Christopher's head.  We just wanted to give him a great big hug although Christopher hates people touching him!<br /><br />Family dynamics were handled with care as the novel unfolded and we realized the great responsibility and stresses that come along with raising an autistic child.  This book was funny, sad, insightful and a joy to read.  It was obvious that the writer did his homework and had worked previously with autistic children. I look forward to many more books by Mark Haddon.<br /><br />Sigrid Macdonald.  Author of D'Amour Road.
B00008DDXC|3.0|\\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" kicked off the Harry Potter franchise with mammoth worldwide business and success.  But as a movie it was sadly lacking, with the glorious exception of near flawless casting.  \\"The Chamber of Secrets,\\" the sequel, does follows the plot theads into some refreshingly darker territory, with a malevolent force attacking students throughout Hogwartz.  But that is of little concern to Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) at first. He just wants to get away from the antagonistical Dursley family and return to school, the only place he feels at home, only to find that a mysterious Chamber has been opened, one that was planted centuries before to kill unworthy students of magic.  Normal muggles.   <br /> <br />Harry, as always, enlists the help of his trusty friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) to find out what is occuring in the dark halls at night.  Even though it is a foregone they will discover the truth, the exceptional cast (Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman and Jason Issacs) make it all fun and a little memorable, despite the film being overstuffed with incident and extraneous detail.  Not to mention the running time goes about a half hour too long. <br /> <br />Much as the first film, \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" is a visual feast, filled with lavishly designed sets, costumes and special effects, all topped off by the impeccable cinematography of Roger Pratt (Batman), who does all he can with director Columbus' stiffly framed style.  Columbus further hamstrings the film, and along with writer Steve Kloves, again try to cram in as much of J.K. Rowling's intricate novel onto the screen as possible.   Once agian the pacing is ground to a frustrating crawl, and whole thing is tempted to crash and burn. But once again, Columbus is saved by his stellar cast who give Rowling's characters great time on the silver screen.  But thankfully, the problems that held the Potter franchise back would eventually be corrected by the addition of direction Alfonso Cuaron, who took over reins for \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban.\\"
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Clutch.   <br />Always pleasing.   <br />Lyrically genius.   <br />Musically Superior.   <br /> <br />Buy this record......
B0009NSE1K|3.0|I am a long and serious Clutch fan. I've loved everything. I have seen them 12 times and the last time was probably an indication to this.If you like Phish, this is for you. The anger is gone, instead you have keyboards. Most bands give up after a few records, at least Clutch made it this long. This truly is a sad day.
B00025ETIW|5.0|MCR is the best...okay, i admit i wasn't too crazy at first about the song i'm not okay, but then it grew on me. then i saw the helena video and that was it. i bought the whole cd and the entire thing is great. every song is my favorite because they are all very VERY good.it is my absolute favorite cd alongside green day's american idiot. Gerard's vocals are awesome and the lyrics make you think... and the music overall is very edgy (especially the sound of Ray's guitar) and almost out of control, which gives it lots of energy. my chemical romance has been compared to bands ranging from the used to AFI but the truth is they have punk and metal influences which combine to make their unique style and sound. i &lt;3 mcr!!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|\\"This cd is absolutely beautiful.I heard \\"Nemo\\" on the radio and fell in love with the song.I then decided to go out and buy the cd....The music really rocks!!!From beginning to end...This is one of the best cd's ever!I just love it!!!!Tarja's voice is like an angel, and when you hear her sing your like in heaven...She has captured my heart with her beautiful voice.Beautiful,absolutely beautiful.What more can I say but that now I'm going to buy all their other cd's and tell everyone I know about this great group...........Nightwish is the greatest!!!!!!!!\\" <br />
0375703764|2.0|Imaginative?  Yes.  Strange? Definitely.  But scarey?  I don't think so. I was really, really dissappointed in this book.  After reading all the reviews, it sounded as though it would scare the pants off me, but I didn't find it frightening in the least.  Instead I found it rambling, repetative, and predictable.
B00005JL2O|4.0|i like the 3rd one very much, its just that they keep using the same jokes all over again, this time they used boobs, the satelite, it is funny but not as funny as the first one, and i thought it was funny how Fat Bastard lost alot of weight, and he had all that extra skin, and the 3rd one starts just like nothing ever happened on the 2nd one, theres no Felicity Shagwell, or the other Austin Powers, or anything, i still thought it was funny, it was funny when Austin Powers blows Brittnay up, then he says \\"Oops!...I Did It Again, Baby\\", he refers to the 1st one and i think the 2nd one too, overall i give the movie, 4 stars because it is still funny, (funnier than the 2nd one), but not as funny as the 1st one
B0001IN0DA|3.0|I am doing a review on Wrestlemania XX and I use a grading system. Each match receives a grade.

Every match with Big Show is going to be slow but this shouldn't have opened it up. The match was average but a bit to short still an alright match. My rating 5.57/10.<br /><br />Match Two-Fatal Four Way-World Tag Team Championships-RVD & Booker T(C)Vs La Resistance Vs Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade Vs The Dudleys-This was the better of the two tag team matches and I believe this was the only one which should have been used. Everyone put on a great perfomance especially RVD. My rating 6.12/10.<br /><br />Match Three-Christian Vs Y2J-This was a good match between the ex best friends. It told a story and it didn't have a clean finish which is good because this great feud can continue. My rating 7.53/10.<br /><br />Match Four-Handicap Match-Rock & Sock Connection Vs Batista, Ric Flair & Randy Orton. This was Wrestlemania, this is what the other matches should be like. This told a story. It wasn't to long, it wasn't short. It was perfect match doing what it needed to do. My rating 7.89/10.<br /><br />Match Five-Interpromotional Match-Playboy Evening Gown Match-Torrie Wilson & Sable Vs Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie-This was terrible it lasted about a minute and it was abismal. Take this off Wrestlemania. My rating 0/10.<br /><br />Match Six-Cruiserweight Open-Cruiserweight Title-Chavo Guerrero(C)Vs Ultimo Dragon Vs Shannon Moore Vs Jamie Noble Vs Funaki Vs Nunzio Vs Billy Kidman Vs Rey Mysterio Vs Tajiri Vs Akio-This was a good match except it was a gauntlet match. It showed many high flying manuevers from many of the finest cruiserweights around. Good match with a bad ending. This should have been like a 10 man Elimination with everyone in the ring at once with no rules. My rating 7.42/10.<br /><br />Match Seven-Interpromotional Match-Special Referee-Stone Cold Steve Austin-Goldberg Vs Brock Lesnar-This was boring as anything  for the first eight minutes or so. This was supposedly the most hyped match but it was a really big dud. This was both mens last match in the company and I'm glad cause this wasn't pretty to watch. My rating 4/10.<br /><br />Match Eight-Fatal Fourway-Tag Team Championships-Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty(C)Vs The Bashams Vs The APA Vs Charlie Haas & Shelton Benjamin-This was nowhere near as good as the Raw Fourway. It shouldn't have been the same match it could have been elimation or something like that. My rating 5.84/10.<br /><br />Match Nine-Title Vs Hair Match-Womens Title-Victoria(C)Vs Molly-Molly loses she gets her head shaved,Molly wins she gets the title. This was an alright match better then most womens matches but still this wasn't great. My rating 4.12/10.<br /><br />Match Ten-WWE Championship-Eddie Guerrero(C)Vs Kurt Angle-This was an awesome match with Eddie lieing,cheating & stealing and Kurt doing his suplexes and all his moves. This match told a story, a story of betrayal and it worked very well. My rating 7.77/10.<br /><br />Match Eleven-Interpromotional Match-Kane Vs Undertaker-This was Undertakers return and it was very good. The entrance, the look of Taker, everything about it was great.

B0008ISM40|2.0|I have been a huge Nine Inch Nails fan for years so it's hard to give this CD a bad review, but I will.  On a positive note the CD is straight to the point and I'm sure the songs will sound great live because of the lack of extra electronic sounds, however it sounds like the whole CD was thrown together.  Trent's lyrics at times seem quite jumbled and sometimes he sounds like he's singing in a garage.  A matter of fact, major portions of the CD sound like it was made by a garage band.  Many fans will hype up this CD but I feel that this is the one CD that doesn't need to be in your Nine Inch Nails collection.
B000001FAO|5.0|This is Great rock ablums I've ever heard. Clapton's Guitar very powerful and attracted me. I love this ablums very much. <br />That's True.
630326669X|1.0|OK, yeah, it's great to see the Stones in the studio working on what would become (almost) their \\"signature tune\\" for awhile.  But this Godard mushwit...I mean, doggone it, by the time \\"Sympathy\\" (the movie, now) was released, the (giggle) \\"revolution\\" concept was just so very trite, passe and O-V-E-R.  Still: seeing this... is this \\"thing\\" supposed to make you want to rush right out and roll some bandages for \\"the revolution?\\"  Oh, give me a break.....
B0006L16N8|4.0|Yes, it did take me several listens (but isn't that the way with all great music ...), but I love every moment of this album. Yes, the words are a bit insipid and not terribly memorable, but the music is genius of the can't-get-out-of-my-head variety. \\"Speed of Sound\\" is actually not the best track; it's hard to say which song is, even the REM-inspired \\"The Hardest Part\\" trancends its first few listens to become a memorable piece. I am impressed. Yes, it's different, but awesomely so.
1400101379|5.0|The noir detective atmosphere of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner combined the with tech and violence of The Matrix. People have their memories and personalities stored in memory and move from body to body over centuries. Criminals are placed in storage while time takes everything they know and everyone they love, their bodies sold as \\"sleeves\\".  <br /> <br />Brutal, not for the sqeamish story. Intense violence, graphic sex, coarse language -- I enjoyed it immensely.

B00005JNJT|5.0|MOVIE: Remember the old days? Where Batman was just Superman without the super powers, where Batman felt like a comic book, where Gotham City felt like some caricature of New York City. Remember those horrible days, the days of Joel Schumacher, the days of Batman looking like some freak show circus. Well my friends, those days are gone and buried . . . at least until they release a collector's set of all the Batman films to date, then we have to relive them. Christopher Nolan brings a new and darker vision to the Batman franchise, and our new Batman couldn't have been a more perfect fit. In this film we go to the roots of the character of Bruce Wayne, and that is what is so special about this film. It manages to make a movie about Bruce Wayne, not about Batman. The movie begins (no pun intended) with Bruce Wayne somewhere in the far east, I guess to do a little soul searching. There he meets Liam Neeson's character who trains him to use his fear to fight crime. After his training, he is asked to behead a known murderer but refuses to do so. Bruce Wayne feels it's the job of the justice system to seal a fate of a criminal, not a lone enforcer. That brings us to his return to Gotham City, a place so corrput and full of crime that it is tearing itself apart.  Gotham City plays a major role in the movie as the backdrop, this is the location of Bruce's home, but the poor state of the city was what lead to his parents getting killed during a mugging when he was a child. Bruce feels it was his fault for his parents' death, it was his fear of bats that led them out of the theater and into the streets where they were killed. Now his father's business is going public, his past and future don't seem to be where he wants them to be. Bruce Wayne now uses what he learned from his journey in the east to enforce justice in the west. He is aided by his good butler Alfred, and a man who works at the abandoned technology wing of his father's corporation, played by Morgan Freeman. This brings us to the antagonist of the film, well actually there is no real main nemesis for Batman in this film. No crazy Joker, or Riddler, or Two Face. Nothing of that nature, but the main person that is contributing to the corrupt justice system of Gotham City is Dr. Crane. A man who seems to get all the criminals convicted of a crime not to be charged by pleading insanity. What he does though is put on a scarecrow mask and release a toxic hallucinogen that basically causes brain damage. This leads Batman to discover a bigger plot. A plot to have Gotham City destroyed from within so that it can rebuild itself back into a civilized city. That is a major theme in this film, the theme of starting over and rebuilding. It seems like a good theme given that this is exactly what this movie is doing to the Batman franchise. This movie is not a superhero movie, but a real film with values. It introduces interesting ideas and has a continuing social commentary on society, which has been plagued by corruption from the times of monarchy up until now. What is really noteworthy of this movie is the score of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. Usually when composers work on the same film it is never together, but as we all know, Hans Zimmer puts emphasis on collaboration. These two long time friends worked closely together to deliver a very dark and intense score.  It's obvious that Zimmer had the greater influence on the score, but you can feel a good deal of Howard's style as well. The score compliments the new dark vision of Batman perfectly, and it really adds depth to the character of Bruce Wayne. This is the perfect action film, with an amazing cast, a dark look on society, and an intense climax.<br /><br />ACTING: Christian Bale fills the shoes perfectly. This is the new Batman for this new vision. There is no way that Michael Keaton or Val Kilmer could fill the shoes with this new twist on the franchise. Those actors are better suited for the comic book version of the series. What amazes me is that Christian Bale is such a natural actor, he has never taken an acting lesson in his life yet manages to pull such interesting characters. I was also amazed at how much bodybuilding he did for the role, it put a shock on my face because the last time I saw him was in The Machinist. A role he lost 63 pounds for, was nothing but skin and bones, and basically a walking skeleton. As for the supporting cast, they were all cast perfectly. Micheal Caine makes a perfect Alfred, the old and wise Butler. Morgan Freeman shines as he always does, but he has limited screen time. Liam Neeson is great in his role, but his character always seems a mystery to the audience. I kind of felt like I wanted to know his background too. Gary Oldman plays Chief Gordon and I'm always fond of Oldman. I believe he is the most versatile actor we have. Cillian Murphy plays Dr. Crane, also known as scarecrow. I think he did a great job, but I also think maybe someone older should of played that role. Although he was able to capture the menacing feel of that character perfectly. Katie Holmes plays the long time friend and love interest of Bruce Wayne, and she does a good job as well.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A film I really enjoyed. A darker and more disturbed vision guides this new Batman to great heights. Christopher Nolan is a director who knows how to create atmosphere. He did it with Memento, he most certainly did it with Insomnia, and now he brings an amazing atmosphere to Batman Begins. Great acting, great directing, and great music combine to make Batman Begins not only a summer blockbuster but a film with character and plot.series.

B00004U2G4|5.0|I like the Jeff Beck-era Yardbirds the best, I like Rod Stewart's first four albums (which he did with Mickey Waller and Ron Wood) and I like Led Zeppelin.  I listened to all of these before I got into Jeff Beck.  Why do I mention these?  Well, because they all connect back to Beck.  This album is for anyone who is a fan of any of the above and is definitely a \\"guitar\\" album.  Sure, Zeppelin and Clapton got all of the attention, but this is where it's at.  I've listened to this album plenty of times and it still sounds fresh.  It also helps that there aren't any hit singles off of it and the radio hasn't killed it. <br /> <br />The highlights?  The very different but still great version of \\"Shapes Of Things,\\" \\"Let Me Love You,\\" \\"Morning Dew,\\" \\"You Shook Me,\\" \\"Beck's Bolero\\" (which you can hear bits of in Led Zeppelin's \\"How Many More Times\\"), and \\"I Ain't Superstitious.\\" <br /> <br />Also, from a guitar player's stand point, this album is absolutely perfect.  Beck's tone is spot on in almost every song and his playing is superb, but not overdone. <br /> <br />If you don't own this, you should. <br /> <br />A side note:  It's really sad when people confuse Jeff Beck with Beck.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I have loved these guys since they came out in 2002. If you have actual taste, love good music in general then I would definitly recomnend that you buy this cd.
B0002S94OS|5.0|The reason to buy this album is its creativity.  I would change some things, but no one else sounds like these guys.  The vocals are much lower and hateful sounding than most washed out death metal style vocalists.   <br /> <br />The drums are probably my favorite.  This guy uses symbols and the double bass drum like a hammer to the face.  You'll think pantera at times for sure -  on guitar, vocals, AND drums - but they don't sound at all like thats their only influence.  This is an album to be excited about - one of only 4 or 5 this year.
0596007124|5.0|I am very suspicious of any book that uses its foreword to explain its teaching strategy.  Most have not lived up to their premise or promise.  This book excels.  The vague notions I had of putting patterns into practice snapped into focus.  The logic \\"argument\\" dialogs echoed my own confusion over the benefits and applications of patterns.  Code examples are written in Java but I could easily translate them to C#.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|The Foo Fighters are an amazing band. I bought this cd the 2nd day it came out, and before that, I knew only about 5 FF songs, like \\"Learn To Fly\\", \\"My Hero\\", \\"Times like These\\", \\"Walking after You\\" and \\"A320\\". I heard their single \\"Best of You\\" and loved it, so I took a chance and bought it. Unbelievable! Foo Fighters are amazing songwriters and amazing music players. \\"Best of You\\" is so emotionally written and deep and is so rocking. Other songs that stand out are \\"No Way Back\\", \\"In Your Honor\\", \\"DOA\\", \\"Resolve\\", and \\"The Deepest Blues are Black\\". The others are also well done.  <br /> <br />The 2nd disc is also great, a bonus to an already well-done album. \\"Still\\", \\"What If I Do?\\", \\"Virginia Moon\\" and \\"Razor\\" are some of my favourites, \\"Still\\" a chilling beautiful song, and \\"Virginia Moon\\" having a bossanova girl-from-ipanema style to it. Norah Jones and Josh Homme make great contributions to these songs.  <br /> <br />I really don't like how people are judging this CD on it's copy-protection. So what, it has nothing to do with what the cd is like, sure if it was bad, you could blame that, but it's awesome cd and people are giving it 1 star because of the copy-protection. It works fine in all my stereos and my car stereo, and my computer required an installation to play the cd, so I installed it, and voila it works. And the Foo Fighters are not \\"selling out\\", they are getting better and better. I am familiar with Dave Grohl, as I am an avid Nirvana fan. I am praising this album In His Honor. <br /> <br />Buy!
B0007Y08IS|2.0|There certainly are funny parts in this movie and the satirical attacks on liberal Hollywood actors and actresses who think they have something worthwhile to say about politics are priceless. That being said, the crude vulgarity factor of the film is high (and disgusting). The \\"F\\" bomb is dropped so much that I was turned off. Body function scenes don't win Oscars from me either, so the film lost some stars from me over this, also. This could have been so much better if it had been less of a gross-out film and more of a satire.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I've seen this film numerous times, the theatrical and director's cut versions. This film remains as one of my favourite movies ever. It's so suspenseful, well written, disturbing, chilling, and violent that it just makes you love it. I had lots of mature themes in it, like a pedophile (played great by Eric Stoltz from \\"Pulp Fiction\\"), a burning of a dog, stabbings, beatings to death, profanity, nudity and sex, prostitution, suicide, and the murder of a woman and her child. But now to the other stuff. <br /> <br />Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) is a troubled young man who discovers he can travel back in time after reading his journals he wrote in as a kid. He tries to go back in time and prevent horrific events from ever happening, but it alters things in the future. When he returns, things range from bad to worse. His friends, his mother and himself aren't the same. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the ending of this film, even though it was sort of bad. In the director's cut version, he goes back to when he was a fetus in his mother's womb, and he strangles himself with his umbilical cord so he never existed, and his closest friend Caley grows up without the trama's of their childhood ever happening and she gets happily married instead of commiting suicide. In the theatrical version, he goes back to when their about 5 or 6 and he tells her he hates her, so they aren't friends throughout their lives, and then they passby on the street, and they both recognize each other but continue walking. This one was more emotional, even though the other ending was happy, this one was sad and emotional and I liked it better. I especially enjoyed the music in this scene, \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" by Oasis, it added to the sadness of this scene. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this film a lot and if you are a fan of suspense and aren't afraid of some violence and blood, you will enjoy this film.
B00005JNJT|4.0|The most entertaining and conventional movie of the \\"Batman\\" series, Christopher Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" seeks to create a launching pad for new slew of Caped Crusader films, and this origin story, while choppy and imperfect, sets the buffet table. Here's report card of the movie's strengths and weaknesses, something to differentiate this review from others: <br /> <br />STRENGTHS: <br /> <br />THE APPROACH - No Marc Chagall nightmare worlds. No zany gay chic. Nolan (\\"Insomnia\\" and \\"Memento\\") and screenwriter David S. Goyer bring realism - considering it worked so well in \\"Spider-Man\\" series - back into the fold. Gotham is a slightly futuristic, burned-out New York. But we can still recognize it; the movie's most glorious shot is of Batman high atop Wayne Tower, looking down upon a candyland of city lights. No special f/x - just a gorgeous shot of a man above his city. \\"Batman Begins\\" has an amount of restraint to it. <br /> <br />THE SCREENPLAY:  Short on one-liners and ominous phrases, long character development and serious talk. Even the Burton \\"Batman\\" movies had a lot invested in being funny; Goyer and Nolan are content to use the natural humor of Christian Bale and trust audience to pay attention, not wait to be entertained.  <br /> <br />CHRISTIAN BALE: Here's the edgy \\"Batman\\" they've been looking for. Bale's played enough villain roles - \\"American Psycho,\\" \\"Shaft\\" - to approach the anti-hero a swirl of swagger, anger, conviction and droll humor. Physically, Bale surpasses Keaton, Kilmer and Clooney. As an actor, he's less mysterious than Keaton - and a little less believable a billionaire tycoon, too - and his \\"tough\\" voice - well, it sounds a little forced. Still - right guy. Fine pick. <br /> <br />ORIGIN STORY: Wayne is investigating the nature of evil in a Chinese prison when his mentor, Ducard (Liam Neeson), rescues and invites him to a training facility in the Himalayas. Ducard teaches him the dark arts, and extracts the story of Bruce's childhood. There are nice touches about bats, the death of his parents, Bruce's planned revenge against his their murderer. Ducard invites Bruce into the League of Shadows, led by Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). The League wants to go a little farther than Bruce is willing to. Bruce declines their offer in violent fashion, returns to Gotham, and, with butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Wayne Enterprises scientist Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman. The \\"origin\\" material is always a little slow - and the cross-cutting between training and Bruce's childhood is a bit annoying, but \\"X-Men\\" and \\"Spider-Man\\" both survived these growing pains for excellent sequels.  <br /> <br />MICHAEL CAINE AND MORGAN FREEMAN: Old pros. Instant credibility.  <br /> <br />GARY OLDMAN AS SGT. GORDON: Finally, a Gordon who's not a caricature or a punchline. Oldman plays him simply as a decent, honest cop, one of the few left in Gotham, and Batman's first partner. The role isn't overplayed, but Gordon does more than just proclaim and stand around - he's shoehorned nicely into the climax. <br /> <br />VILLAINS: Not unforgettable. Just not stupid. It makes sense that the first criminal worth fighting is simply mob boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul is a thinking man's villain, and The League of Shadows are pretty faceless but not cartoonish. Cillian Murphy is funny/creepy as Dr. Johnathan Crane/The Scarecrow, but he doesn't have much to do. \\"Batman Begins\\" is focused more on the Bat than it is his tormentors, as it should be, because these villains likely won't roll around again.  <br /> <br />MUSICAL SCORE: By Howard Shore and James Newton Howard. Never intrudes, usually enhances. During the \\"money shot\\" scene - that one atop Gotham - it's quiet and grand. <br /> <br />LEAGUE OF SHADOWS INITIATION: Mysterious and unpredictable, Nolan shot and edited this sequence more for the idea being enclosed by 30 deadly assassins than clarity. Suspenseful.  <br /> <br />WEAKNESSES <br /> <br />KATIE HOLMES:  Her Rachel Dawes, childhood friend of Bruce Wayne and gritty Gotham prosecutor, is a grim one, a stick in the mud who talks at length about doing justice without accomplishing much. In this day and age, is a lawyer really a symbol of virtue? Holmes isn't in the movie much, the romance is downplayed, but her character wears a rather unfortunate silk blouse in the movie's second-to-last scene.  <br /> <br />CONTINUITY: At times \\"Batman Begins\\" strikes me as cobbled together in parts. The beginning is especially jagged, though necessarily so. The plot is a little too jammed, though: Rutger Hauer has no purpose as the de facto head of Wayne Enterprises - unless he figures into the sequel. Rachel's boss disappears without much fanfare. Falcone, the mob boss, goes off the map halfway through the picture.  <br /> <br />BATMOBILE CHASE: The vehicle itself - cross a Hummer and the design of a B-2 Stealth Bomber - is interesting. The chase through Gotham, more than ten minutes long, is blah.  <br /> <br />ACTION SCENE AT THE DOCKS: Again. Blah.  <br /> <br />CLIMACTIC ACTION SCENE: On an elevated train at night. Not nearly as effective as a similiar scene in \\"Spider-Man.\\" Anti-climactic and, since it's in the dark of night, not exactly thrilling.  <br /> <br />VILLAINOUS PLOT TO DESTROY GOTHAM: It's a blatant steal from the original \\"Batman!\\" Chemicals combining with other chemicals. Deadly gases. A poisoned populace.  <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Batman Begins\\" takes on a bigger assignment than its predecessors and passes, well. The franchise is built to last with a grounding in semi-reality and four excellent actors - Bale, Oldman, Caine and Freeman - to carry it for a couple more films. Nolan, should he continue, will get a bigger budget to play with a splashy villain and maybe a more interesting female lead than Holmes, who is pretty and upstanding but a bit of a bore.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I seen this film with high expectations, I've seen all the Batman films, and I liked them all, well, Batman and Robin was...sub-par. Batman and Batman Returns were well done, and Batman Begins could easily compare. Christian Bale is a magnificent actor, after I seen him in \\"Reign of Fire\\" and \\"American Psycho\\". He did have a little problem with his Batman voice, it was a little too raspy and tough-guyish, but other than that, he was a frightening hero who saved Gotham from a deadly gas. <br /> <br />The film has a large and effective cast. Micheal Caine, a great choice for Alfred, brings laughs and a warm heart. Morgan Freeman plays Batman's gagdets man Lucius Fox, who has only a small role, but still great. Katie Holmes plays Rachel Dodson, Batman's close friend and heart's interest. She's pretty good, compared to Kim Basinger and Nicole Kidman. Gary Oldman plays Gordon, Batman's friendly police officer, and does a good job at it too. The Commisioner Gordon in the later Batman films is Pat Hingle, and he wasn't that good. Liam Neeson is awesome as Henri Ducard, Batman's former trainer turned villain. Cillian Murphy played the horrific Scarecrow, but only <br />had a small role, which was dissapointing because it was such an awesome character, and he didn't appear to be defeated, he was electricuted by Rachel and then he was gone from the rest of the film. Too bad. <br /> <br />The action was great, great car chase scene, and explosions and things crashing and smashing, and the fighting was good too, except the camera was awkward during fights, making the view close up and weird to distinguish between whats going on and who's getting hurt. <br /> <br />Something that bothered me was how it interacted with the first Batman film. In Batman, Jack (the Joker) kills Bruce's parents. But in this, some thug who's name I didn't catch (but it wasn't Jack) kills his parents. And at the end of Batman Begins, Gordon hands Batman a Joker card telling him this is his next villian, but in Batman, Jack doesn't turn into the Joker until later in the film. <br /> <br />Overall, an awesome and well-done and well-casted movie!
B0000640VN|2.0|Or maybe not.<br /><br />At first, the romantic comedy Kate & Leopold seems like an odd film for James Mangold to direct in between the teenager-in-an-asylum movie Girl, Interrupted and the slasher-horror film Identity. Mangold's other movies (like Cop Land) are more noirish than cute, too.<br /><br />But Kate & Leopold does have one thing in common with Girl, Interrupted and Identity - - one of the main characters is in a mental institution. Stuart, an inventor and Kate's old boyfriend, is locked up when he says he's discovered a crack in time that permits travel to 1876. Stuart also says the man staying in his apartment is an English duke who came back with him from 1876. Of course Kate and Leopold fall in love.<br /><br />It's too bad Leopold couldn't have found a way to stay with Kate in the twenty-first century. Kate and Leopold both make a physical leap (off the Brooklyn Bridge, which is just over the time portal Stuart discovered), but Leopold jumps back to a familiar world. Kate gives up her family and her career. Leopold is also an inventor and an educated aristocrat and would have more opportunities in Kate's time than Kate would as a woman in his. (\\"Research is a fine profession for a woman. Suitable to the feminine mind.\\")<br /><br />Many reviewers of this movie have noticed that Kate chooses the traditional role, picking a man over a life. But Leopold is more afraid of the new than Kate, and by going back to 1876 Leopold takes the easy way out. Just like Kate, Leopold's choice limits his possibilities (but not to the same extent as Kate's).<br /><br />Leopold has already invented the elevator in his own time, inspired by the \\"erections\\" (I hope Mangold is ashamed of the childish jokes in the first scene) being built in 1876. During his time in the twenty-first century he even invents an improved toaster. For Leopold to go back and miss out on what the new age has to offer is just as cowardly as Kate trying to be the heroine in one of her assistant's romance novels instead of living in the real world.<br /><br />We don't see much of 1876 society except for a grand ball at Leopold's uncle's mansion, which is good, because the poverty and racism in the time Leopold came from might spoil our fantasy. When a black female New York cop tells Leopold to pick up dog poop, his reaction is respectful, admirable, and completely unbelievable. Leopold accepts the social differences between his time and ours too easily.<br /><br />The DVD has the original theatrical release and the director's cut. The director's cut makes a few of the time-travel twists more understandable. The director's cut tells us that Leopold is Stuart's ancestor, which is why Leopold has to get back to 1876, otherwise Stuart won't be born. That also makes Stuart, who has just broken up with Kate, someone who (assuming Kate and Leopold live happily ever after) has been sleeping with his great-great-something grandmother. The producers might have thought that was a little too Sophoclean for the theatrical release.<br /><br />If you want to see a dumb romantic comedy that doesn't leave a taste in your mouth like Farmer's Bounty (the \\"raw suet\\" margarine Leopold winds up being TV spokesman for), check out Wimbledon or One Fine Day.stant's romance novels instead of living in the real world. <br /> <br />We don't see much of 1876 society except for a grand ball at Leopold's uncle's mansion, which is good, because the poverty and racism in the time Leopold came from might spoil our fantasy.

B000063K2W|4.0|I recently purchased the Joan Crawford Collection box set through amazon and loved it.  All of the titles, including this one, are among Joan Crawford's best, that I am looking forward to Warner/Turner's release of more of her MGM films on DVD.  This film is hilarious, and is carried off wonderfully by such a talented cast, including Norma Shearer and the always funny Roz Russell. I have always enjoyed this film, and the film itself deserves 5 stars.  I only gave the DVD a four star rating on account of the packaging, namely the incorrect black and white photo on the back cover.  By examining it closely, one can see that this photo is not from this film or time period at all.  It appears to be a picture from an Anne Bancroft film.  I realize that this is not that important, but I do think that more effort should have been put into the packaging of such a wonderful film, especially since it was released by a company like Warner, and not some budget company.  The DVD itself is very good and includes many nice features, so I have no complaints there, just the minor one about the cover art on the case.
B000002WNP|4.0|I was dissapointed to see that this set does not contain all of the Elvis Masters from the 60's.  It only contians what RCA considers \\"essential.\\"  For example, if you want live, gospel, or movie material, you must go elsewhere.  This just does not have it.  On the other hand, what the box set does have is great and it leaves you wanting more.
B000002I27|5.0|strange days is a great opener. it shows you what this album is going to be like. this album is weird, unique, mournful, and just plain old doors. except its not plain at all. if the genius of their music is ever to be questioned, the nay-sayers need only to listen to the masterpiece known as when the music's over. that song is one of the best classic rock songs period. in between those two songs you get 8 other outstanding tracks and jim's lyrics are deeper than ever, and gloomier than any other album outside of soft parade. but it's gloomy in a way that it still paint a portrait in your mind as opposed to make you wanna kill yourself as most artists do now-adays. the top songs are strange days, people are strange, love me two times, and when the music's over. the rest of the album is solid as well.
B000002WUD|4.0|The box set contains the A and B sides to most of the Elvis singles (3 stars), the best studio out takes (4 stars), and the best of his live shows (5 stars, I know that the most you can give is 4) from the 70s.  This set is definately worth having.  It shows that Elvis was not a has-been in the 70s.  All you have to do is listen to the live &#34;Elvis Show&#34; disk, and you will be blown away like I was.  The power and precision in his voice were awsome.
B000002BFL|4.0|This quiet sequel to 1982's \\"Nebraska\\" came two years into the Clinton administration just as the country was recovering from the Reagan era and before the boom that would define the end of the decade. The actors on \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" seem to have it no better in the mid-90's and these songs focus on the same loss, betrayal, and despair that tinted \\"Nebraska\\". It highlights the unfortunate reality that drastic change in the human condition isn't easily achieved, and sure as hell isn't done quickly. So thirteen years later you still have the same type of wanderers who are still so lost and still only left to wonder why.  <br /> <br />The sparse musical landscape that houses these songs were meant to highlight the literary intensity of Springsteen's lyrics. This makes the words themselves the music (in fact they are so rich that they can be easily read and understood reading from the liner notes). And the album plays like a sort of short story collection, with every one loosely lending itself to it's overall theme. These extremely capable renderings do put into fine view it's veterans, homeless strangers, and drifters, and while these stories are being told you know you're hearing them the way they were meant to be heard. Albums like \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" showcase Bruce Springsteen as one of the finest storytellers in rock & roll, and it also happens to be one of his best.  <br /> <br />STANDOUT TRACKS: 01- THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD, 02- STRAIGHT TIME 04- YOUNGSTOWN, 05- SINALOA COWBOYS  <br />
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This movie had moments of LOL/fall down humor, and then many moments you questioned what you were watching. First off mattonettes are hard to control let alone make them do some of the stuff that they do is amazing. There is one scene that is a reminder of what your Barbie and Ken really used to do. I laughed so hard. That is a funny part. The music is not as good as the South Park movie, which i have in my cd player often.<br /><br />Also the celebrities that include are really funny! This movie left me with a new movie quote. \\"MATT DAMON\\" Watch and you'll know why!! :O<br /><br />Jessica
0060763280|1.0|I wish I did not rush out and get this book because as many have said this is a book used as a upsell to the HIGH PRICED talks or workshops this man is hustling. I have not finished this book but so far there is alot of nothing being said accept to get more info take one of many courses offered. Oh and when you try to get the free stuff he offers in the book the web site does not work very well and I was not able to getthe free offer so I don't know if that is just more hype or maybe I will find somthing of substance that I have not yet found from reading this book. If it gets better I will come back and let you know but notice how many people are not pleased by the scam of this book. I truly hope it gets better and that I was not taken.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Breaking News: MARIAH CAREY IS ON FIRE. Not only has We Belong Together shattered its own Airplay record, but the follow up single is the fun bouncy Shake It Off. This album is full of hits and will eventually go down as one of Mariah's best. I am so glad I bought this cd and look foward to more of Mimi's era.
0060763280|1.0|He called it the financial bluprint and i called it the seminar seller. What so valuable about this book by asking you to attend his seminars? What's the point of writing the book if the the writer keeps asking the reader to attend his seminars? Why not try to explain what you know all in this book just like what Anthony Robbins did to his book!
B00097DX3U|2.0|Audioslave's first album was fantastic and I consider it one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Needless to say, I was very excited to get Out of Exile, hoping that there would be more hard-edged, progressive songs.  Sadly, after playing it repeatedly, I grow more and more disappointed by it.  Now, this disappointment is making me angry.  How could this band produce such a formulaic, pop album after creating such music masterpieces as Bring Em Back Alive and Exploder?  Be Yourself is simply a copy of Like a Stone, complete with matching guitar solo.  And what in the world is that high singing part in Dandelion?  I cringe when I hear it because it's so syrupy.  #1 Zero is a copy of Soungarden's Tighter and Tighter that lacks any originality.  Also, does Yesterday and Tomorrow remind anyone of Pearl Jam's Jeremy?  And the final song on the album, The Curse, is such a formula pop rock ballad.  It's as if the song was written as a concert ender, where people can flick their bics and wave their hands in the air.  Yuck.  To judge this band's huge decline in originality, just compare The Curse to The Last Remaining Light, the brilliant and dark ending from the first album.      When I saw an interview on CNN a few weeks ago, Audioslave  members said they didn't really know each other on the first album.  They are feeling like a more integrated band now.  Well, that saddens me tremendously, because I miss the incredible progressive edge that Audioslave produced in 2002.  My husband speculates that Chris' substance abuse helped fuel the first album, as it did on Soundgarden's masterpieces, and now that he's clean, he's lost the need to be so heavy.  Gosh, Audioslave, can't you be sober and also write incredible songs?    This is very hard for me to write, since I so admire Chris Cornell and his musical and lyrical talent.  I hope that their next album isn't so trivial.
B0002YCVXI|4.0|Yo-Yo Ma is certainly one of the premiere cellists of today and his performances in the symphony concert halls and in chamber music concerts are always illuminating and impact audiences with the incredible skill and sonority of his chosen instrument.  Perhaps it is the 'Everyman' syndrome that encourages Ma to enter fields usually not taken by classical cellists, as though he wants to offer his talent for the appreciation of all audiences.  He has recorded Appalachian songs, Tangos, the oriental sounds of the Silk Road, and has been featured in movie sound tracks while still performing the full spectrum of the classical repertoire.  There can only be admiration for such intent.<br /><br />In this CD he has collaborated with renowned movie music composer Ennio Morricone creating transcriptions of the scores of such films as 'The Mission', 'Cinema Paradiso', 'The Legend of 1900', 'The Untouchables', 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly', 'Once Upon a Time in America' and others and the result is a series of 'cello concerti'.  Some of these work well (the excerpts form 'The Mission' are truly beautiful, but that was one of Morricone's finest scores in the first place), and some of them sound a bit like Muzak or elevator music.  Ma's playing is consistently elegant and lovely and if the content of Morricone's music is occasionally slight, then it must be remembered that this music was written as background music for visual dramas.<br /><br />The recording is not truly in the classical mode, just in case Ma's devoted fans may think this is going to be deep music.  But the collection is well executed and the music is never less than lovely.  With that in mind the CD can be generally recommended. Grady Harp, June 05
B000002N3N|5.0|This album is so hauntingly beautiful.  It reminds me of how the Celts and Druids would endow trees with human and other life characteristics.  Now...every time I prune a tree I expect it to say \\"ouch!\\", or when I walk by a tree I expect it to reach out to me.  Listening to this album, especially after consuming a quart or more of good Irish whiskey is a delight.  I remember trees and I am sure, after listening to this album, that they remember me also.  Definitely a buy!  Cuckoo ForCeltic <br />
B0007M22TI|5.0|Prior to watching this DVD I read several personal reviews here on Amazon which criticized the performers, cuts, and audio quality. All I can say after watching this is that those who criticized the sound quality must own substandard DVD players or audio equipment because the sound quality and balance between the lead vocals, background vocals, and instrumentals was perfect in my studio.<br /><br />I do agree that some of the the vocalists could have been more animated; however, their physical beauty and vocal talents more than made up for any shortcomings. This DVD -- and the corresponding CD recording -- will hold a high position in my Celtic music collection. Several of the music tracks have an airy quality -- in the style of Enya and other traditional Celtic vocalists -- so this may not be everyone's cup of tea. But for those who appreciate beautiful soprano voices with amazing instrumental arrangements, this is the DVD to buy!!<br /><br />BTW: The voice of Chloe combined with the musical talent of David Agnew on the Oboe made for an absolutely stunning rendition of Nella Fantasia.<br /><br />BUY THIS DVD.
B0007TKNKG|4.0|This movie came out when I was in high school and I really liked it then and I was happy to see that it was out on dvd. My favorite movie by Stallone is still the first Rambo movie which is just great but this one also belongs in my dvd collection as well. Also check out his new book called Sly Moves it's a very interesting read.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Dennis Quaid just might be the worst actor for the role of Jack Hall. There is something horrific about his screen presence that makes me want to take him \\"not seriously\\" Within this blockbuster,there lies a love story.It had to be because the director was too busy trying to be a Word Wide Hit.I'll excuse that and move on.<br /><br />Sam Hall played by Mr.Whoever was quite nonsensical.Reason,he's 17 and is supposed to be some sort of genius.To me he was sleep inducing. I actually slept after 50 mins of this film and watched it the next morning the second part.The reason for that was that I didn't quite feel what the film maker wanted the viewer to feel.<br /><br />The best two scenes in the film - the ones when the wolf jumped for SAM HALL (Mr.Whoever) I only wish he caught him and bit him off. I wouldnt have had to visit the worst father-son relationship story in a film ever.<br />Second fav.scene in the film I liked was the one where the Statue of Liberty was over taken by an ocean.Come on! That was just plain awesome.<br /><br />I live in New Delhi and I only wonder if my country looked like that.No seriously,I enjoyed the 130 second attention they paid to it.I think half way down the movie the director changed the script.The President dies and no scene based on that is shown.I mean, they show some idiot on the tv being dragged away but not the President of USA.<br /><br />I'll stop sounding like a hypocrite now.<br />Watch this movie for the same reason I did.I wondered how horrid it could be.<br /><br />2.75 Stars made it 3 Stars<br /><br />The best Sci-fiction ever is \\"The Core\\"<br /><br />PERIOD
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have been a fan of Mariah Carey since Vision of Love and when she came out with Always Be My Baby and Breakdown (featuring Bone Thugs&Harmony)I knew she was going to always be my favorite, and now her she is back stronger than ever with We Belong Together inwhich I love this song I played it so much my son knows the words and he is 7 years old,and Shake it off is this song is hot the whole cd is hot. Mariah or MiMI is definitly doing her thing and this is also bringing Jermaine dupri back to the spot inwhich he belongs, he is one of the best producers out. I love the little guy:~) but anyway stick a fork in me im done and thanks for viewing my review byeeeeeeeeee

B000002UA0|5.0|\\"Do you remember when you were young? You shone like the sun\\" - A memorable line from a memorable song. The song, entitled \\"Shine On, You Crazy Diamond\\" was a tribute piece, dedicated to the founder of Pink Floyd, and the creative drive behind this particular Pink Floyd album. His name is Syd Barrett, and he was the mind behind \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\". <br /> <br />The year was 1969, and pshycedelia was at an all-time high. Everybody seemed to enjoy trippy, colorful music that could give people out-of-this-world images. Syd Barrett was one of the most talented song-writers of his time, and he was able to give these kinds of qualities to his songs and more. Some people find this comparison extreme, but I feel that if John Lennon is the basis for song writing skills, Syd Barrett is his younger brother, the one who was never nearly as popular but made more artistic, and less-accessible work. <br /> <br />Barrett's only major album from Pink Floyd was filled with creatures, tales, and strange new musical innovations. He sang of gnomes, scare crows, Egyptian cats, out of control doctors, and planetary systems. The lyrics were playful but at the same time frightening. The instrumentals had a strange connectivity with the liquid singing. The words were carefully selected and used in a very fun and exciting English accent. The songs are written in a way that are extremely fitting for Syd Barrett's playing style. One reading just lyric sheets of this album may consider the lyrics junk, but when put to guitars, bass, keyboard, and drums, and with a pinch of Barrett's genius, they come to life. All of the sudden, nothing means something. All of the sudden, just ordinary phsychedelia becomes innovation. <br /> <br />\\"A movement is accomplished in six stages... and the seventh brings return\\". <br />\\"Doctor please kindly tell your wife that I\\"m alive! Realize! Realize! Realize!\\" <br />\\"And then one day, hurray, another way for gnomes to say, Oh My!\\" <br />\\"I've got a clan of gingerbread men - here are men, there are men, lots of gingerbread men - take a couple if you wish, they're on the dish\\" <br /> <br />One might ask what Syd was on when he was writing this music. Sadly, he was on LSD, and it completely destroyed his musical career and put him into a downward spiral that made him end up out of the band, living in isolation with only his mother in his home in Britain. However, due to Syd's short-lived career (releasing a total of three albums), Pink Floyd became one of the biggest, best, and most amazing bands to ever exist. Because of Barrett, and because of this album, psychedelic rock music became more than just trippy special effects and incoherent mumblings. It was a new way to incorporate very catchy (and eerily cheerful) music with very complex song structures, while still making it accessible to a large crowd. <br /> <br />Who can I recommend this album to? I will recommend it to anybody who has ever wanted to hear where Rock music's roots came from. I recommend this album to anybody who wants to hear some of the most creative and unique music from the late 60s era, and I recommend this album to all people out there who appreciate passionate creativity. This album was an amazing production, which lead to both greatness and misery, and both of those feelings are ones that you can share with Syd when experiencing this breakthrough work of art.
B00008WT5J|5.0|Even though it's not intentionally cut out to be an AC/DC compilation, it is technically a collection. Not entirely equipped with all (or even more) of their best songs, it is a good sampler, as well as a good soundtrack to a not-so-good movie. It's just too bad that AC/DC couldn't come up with at least 6 more new tracks to call it a 1986 full length album.  <br />The title track is probably my all-time favorite AC/DC song, because the music is catchy and Johnson sounds excellent. A more composed solo, and it would be a more perfect song. D.T. and Chase The Ace, are hard-rocking, fast-moving instrumentals which show how incredible the 4 instrument-playing members are. And, the rest of this album is classic AC/DC tunes used in the movie, and another chance to listen to them. The new (in 1986) version of Shake Your Foundations appears Brian Johnson to be sounding \\"not so far away\\" as his sound is on the Fly On The Wall album. It's not as long as the original version, but just as good. A good start or addition for any AC/DC fan upcoming or continuing.
B000683VI4|5.0|For myself this was one of those movies that is one of the great treats of being a fan: a film that comes along every so often and has you thinking that it's probably going to be pretty good but goes and blows away all expectations to stand as one of the elite.  In its opening minutes I thought it was actually going to fall below my initial expectations, as it took a few minutes to start to warm up to the Noah character (I liked Allie right from the start) but as things got going it just captivated me.  A rich, at times rather harrowing, very moving and sexy love story that incorporates dashes of comedy and mystery as well as eternally memorable moments popping up throughout.  Exceptionally done in every regard, with special kudos for the acting, photography and the gorgeous lighting capturing things like the sunrise on the lake - all this and great characterization make this a romantic drama that actually sits up there with the likes of \\"Ghost\\", \\"Millennium Actress\\" and \\"Titanic\\".  If you dip only occasionally into the drama section make sure this is one of the movies you check out.
B0007GAERG|5.0|You know how well she sings. The formula for success is here. And it worked!! The album has already sold over two million copies. Reviewers weren't lying when they said it was a comeback. My favorites: \\"It's Like That\\"; \\"We Belong Together\\" (my favorite); \\"Shake It Off\\"; \\"Mine Again\\"; \\"Fly Like A Bird\\"; \\"Get Your Number\\"; \\"One and Only\\"; \\"Stay the Night\\"; and \\"I Wish You Knew\\". Musical versatility and vocal talent at it's greatest...
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I loved this film!! It was exreamly beautiful and well made. Although, one thing got on my nerves: the characters would speak a sung part then burst into song. But, I thought the casting was well done. Emmy Rossum played a very innnocent, young Christine. I don't really like the character Christine, but I kind of liked her in this version. Patrick Wilson played a very good Raoul both vocally and in how he acted. I am by no means a Raoul fan, but I do have to say that he did well. Minnie Driver was a perfect Carlotta. She cracked me up!!! I love her accent and aditude. Now, some may disagree, but I thought Gerard Butler played a very obsessed Phantom. Michael Crawford has a great voice, but Gerard Butler has tons of emotion. Like in \\"The Music of the Night\\" and \\"All I ask of You reprise\\". But \\"The Point of No Return\\" was so full of lusty/sad emotion becuase he knew that this would never work.  <br />The swordfight was kind of lame. I love swords, but having the Phantom loose to wimpy Raoul? That's just wrong. Plus, the Phantom is supposed to be UGLY. This Phantom was so young and hot that I couldn't figure out why Christine choose Raoul. Even with his mask off, he was hot. I don't see how he could be called \\"The Devil's Child\\" when it looked like he just had some wrinkles or a slight burn on the area around his right eye.  <br />But the ending scene, when the older Raoul, visits Christine's grave, he sees a rose and a ring. The rose was identical to the ones the Phantom gave her and the ring was the wedding ring the Phantom gave her too. Then Raoul looked to the middle of the graveyard and I expected to see the Phantom pop out, but he didn't. That was a little dissapointing.  <br />
B0002ZEYYQ|5.0|Three weeks ago, I had the oportunity to listen to the full CD and own it. Obviously, my first impression was like...DAMNNNNN...THIS CD  REALLY ROCKS!!! <br />Now that it is available (at last) for all of the fans out there it's great because they can now experience what Dynamite is really made up of. Right from the start we got this new kinda style FEELS JUST LIKE IT SHOULD...which is ok, then we have DYNAMITE... which is pure funk and disco style...bass lines everywhere...this song should be released as a single, it's a must!!! When it comes to summer time vibes then SEVEN DAYS IN SUNNY JUNE is the perfect option...good lyrics and harmonious tunes...ELECTRIC MISTRESS...is an electrifying dance experience...you'll start dancing right from the very first second of the song...STARCHILD...pure disco style...relevant lyrics...just great...LOVE BLIND...kinda strange ... gets better with a few listenings though...TALULAH...here we go back in time...you will definetely remember the Emergency On Planet Earth and The Return Of The Space Cowboy eras...delicious!!!...GIVE HATE A CHANCE...was the first song of the cd that I listened to and I couldn't have chosen a better song...you have to feel these bass lines on your own to tell how great this song is...definetely a high point in the album...excelent and relevant lyrics without a doubt...I started dancing by myself right away...lol...delightful...my ideal single for the future...one of my faves of course...WORLD THAT HE WANTS...mmm...the political touch...typical Jay Kay lyrics...BLACK DEVIL CAR...it's nice...fast lyrics though...HOT TEQUILA BROWN...good song...as simple as that...BEATBOX...really tells what rhythm is made up of...and to finish we have TIME WON'T WAIT...definetely one of my faves...you can imagine Jamiroquai and Earth Wind & Fire together in the studio and it wouldn't seem weird at all...percussion everywhere...bass lines...great lyrics...what can be more perfect than that???? <br />So there it is, a whole new Jamiroquai experience for us to live. Thank you Jamiroquai for these amazing vibes...good music and fun is guaranteed...as always!!!!!
0062502182|5.0|I can't even begin to tell you how much I thoroughly loved this book. It is a fable but it speaks to so many truths that we as humans experience. It is about a young man's spiritual journey and pulls you from beginning through end. I have already had about 4 other people read it since I read it and they have all LOVED it. I'm ever confident that you will love this book!!
0375703764|5.0|This book broke my brain. But in a very delightful sort of way. I didn't sleep, get up out of bed (except for biological necessities), or do anything but read this book for two days straight plowing through it. <br /> <br />By the time I was finished, I was as delerious as our narrators and the subject of their narration, and buzzed beyond belief. It's an engrossing novel told in footnotes and indices with wry nods to lit and film crit and an overall Lovecraftian feel.  <br /> <br />Ia! Ia!
B0000025T6|5.0|Powerful. Chilling. Beautiful. Moody. Sublime. Poignant. Masterful. Stark. Poetic. Heartwrenching. Funny. Raw. Minimalist. Subtle. Dangerous. Simply one of the greatest records I have ever heard.    <br />You could go on and on about this one. The cover photo to start with: Who would have the guts to put a b/w blurry photo, shot out of the windshield of a car on the front of a record? Why isn't it color? Where's the focus? Where are the people? Why no nice scenery? Not interested in any of that here! It works so wonderfully well, as does everything about this true masterpiece of an album. The record which showed what Springsteen was really all about.  <br />The stories, the people, the events he tells us about, they are so real. Mr. State Trooper: Please Don't Stop Me. You listen to that thing over and over again. The repetition of the bass chord of the acoustic guitar evoke the steady beat of rain and windshield wipers, the purring of an engine, traveling too fast in the night, on the run to or from--what? <br />Not really a song, more of a chant, it's a work of towering genius, one of the most evocative and transcendental things you could ever hear. He creates more with one guitar string and his own expressive voice than most musicians do with a full band.   <br />This is the opposite of a commercial release. It's the equivalent of a great black and white movie, which, let's face it, most people don't like to watch anymore. But it is so true that in many ways the black and white is more colorful, more truthful, more expressive than full, garish color. Think \\"In Cold Blood\\", \\"Red River\\", \\"The Seventh Seal\\", even \\"Sin City\\".  <br />This is about the only Springsteen album I listened to for years.  <br />Glad to see he is now doing an acoustic tour, which I would much more likely go to. Thanks
B000007T2Z|5.0|Maybe no one else will feel this way about this album simply because, perhaps, no one else quite came up with the same mental imagery as I did.  But it seems some people got the \\"end of the world\\" idea so I guess there are some who are close. <br /> <br />I was listening to this record at like 5 AM, just sitting in my room in the dark with only a sliver of dawn coming through.  I closed my eyes the whole time and....wow.  I've never listened to anything this dark and devastating.  No kiddies, Poison The Well, Slipknot and Cannibal Corpse are not dark and devastating, they are impotent morons who pose for the whiny and angsty 15-year-olds of America.  This, however.....THIS.....when I was listening to this, I almost clearly saw what the future armageddon looks like.  Dark clouds over a broken city with weary and dirty humans stumbling around the streets of rubble.  Standing on the edge of humanity as we know it was what I felt I was doing the whole time listening to this record.  Which leaves some issues people have brought up about it... <br /> <br />Experimental?  Pretentious?  Self-indulgent? <br /> <br />No.  This isn't Dream Theater, or Radiohead, or The Mars Volta.  This isn't pseudo-intellectual rock dripping with electronics and artificial lyrics to tell you how to feel.  Godspeed play natural, artistic music that comes almost entirely from the heart with just enough thought power to make it work.  Listen to this album and take a walk down the shattered streets, appreciating the last moment you'll ever get to see your lover.  Or perhaps it's the aftermath of destruction, and you are a survivor?  Board the train and watch the storm clouds quickly approach the skyline, or maybe stare at the face of a conductor who has lost his will to live and is simply doing his job out of primitive instinct.  What may seem like a glimmer of hope at first turns out only to be the sounds of a vacant carnival, or maybe a playground.  It's all up to you, really.  The tone of thealbum is laced in death and destruction, but it's your job to put in the pictures. <br /> <br />Godspeed You Black Emperor's \\"f#a#oo\\" doesn't demand that you wrap your head around some drawn-out concept or look for a hidden meaning around every corner.  It simply asks that you fall into it, like a daydream or a fever.
0060723513|1.0|This book claims to chronicle the true story of an American woman's physical and spiritual journey from her American home to an Australian aboriginal tribe called the Real People and ultimately to a three month journey across Australia. <br /> <br />As a piece of non-fiction, this work is defamatory and blatantly untrue. As a piece of fiction (as its publisher has now classified it), this work is ill-researched and shows grave misunderstandings of the aboriginal people of Australia and of Australia itself. Its blatant errors are too numerous to list, however I've detailed a few of the more egregious ones: a car journey from a major Australian metropolitan city to the red centre in a measly four hours, the aboriginal people she journeyed with using a camel hoof to create a sharp instrument, and a hand in the invention of fly screens. Very briefly, it would take a rocket car to make a four hour journey from any of Australia's major metropolitan cities (containing an international airport) to the red centre,  - the `hoof' of a camel is not at all like a horse's hoof but in fact closer resembles the soft padding of a dog's paw, and fly screens have been used in Australia long before Morgan dreamt of defaming it. <br /> <br />I find the most damaging aspect of this work is not the blatant errors, but the reinforcement that white people believe all indigenous cultures to be the same. The `Real People' tribe bares striking resemblance to the indigenous American cultures, right down to their names, a tool not dissimilar to the indigenous American dream catcher, and the position of one of the `Real People' as the tribe's chief. Aboriginal tribes do not have chiefs. <br /> <br />Some people will have you believe that it is not important that the author made the story up, that it is about emotion and spiritual journey. They are sadly misled, as this book is as thin in spirituality as it is in research or fact. <br /> <br />There is a book detailing aboriginal life, hardships,and a long journey. It has the added advantages of not only being a great read, but of being written by an aboriginal descended from the story's main character and it is actually true. Go and read \\"Along the Rabbit Proof Fence\\" and ignore Mutant Message Downunder, you'll thank me for it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I discovered Evanescence a while back while seeing the \\"My Immortal\\" video in a record store.  I liked it so much I HAD to get the album.  And I loved every song.  Now I can't get enough of them.  \\"Origin\\" is also an excellent album.
1400032717|5.0|This was quite an interesting look into an autistic boy's brain. More a character study than a fiction novel, although the narrative is quite interesting. The main character is probably one of the most interesting in years, just for the fact that he thinks so differently than most people.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Finally, this is what I expected from Audioslave in the first place. On the first album it seemed that Cornell had too much influence and the album had a little bit sluggish tempo throughout. This time former members of RATM let loose and took Cornell with them. Morello's amazing guitar sounds backed up by an awsome base and heavy drumming give this album unmistakable energy, even through the slower songs. Spiced up with Cornell's vocals, I dare to say this might be better than some of the original Rage. <br />Sure there is song \\"Be Yourself\\" which will be played on the radios and althought the song is good, band's strength lies elswhere. \\"Number 1 Zero\\" and \\"Your Time Has Come\\" are some of the few examples what this album is truly about. I hope You enjoy it as I did many and many times.
0393035158|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book, but only got about 20 pages into it when I realized that it was reading like  a fleshed-out undergrad philosophy thesis, self-indulgent \\"witty\\" endnotes and all.  I looked in the back cover, and sure enough, it was written by a philosophy undergrad at Stanford.  Now, there's nothing wrong with that as such, but if you are interested in real scholarship on the topic of the influence of religion (particularly fundamentalist faith) on the world, then there is really no greater tome at large today than Karen Armstrong's \\"The Battle for God\\".   I was genuinely shocked to see that Mr. Harris did not cite to that work a single time. He does get off a few good bon-mots, but that's not worth the price of the book.  If you want solid scholarship, please read Ms. Armstrong's book.
B000003TA4|1.0|I love NIRVANA. The world should be listening to more Heavy Death Metal music with barking, gurgling lyrics, and tons of machismo. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRR!!!!!! <br />(Note: NIRVANA bore all this self-loathing Metal Revival sh*t) <br /> <br />Bow to the GODS OF METAL! Rack of Lamb of God is my only music band (foams at mouth)! <br /> <br />Teen Spirit is the only goood song on here. Kurdt was so preoccupied with his heroin to even think of writing goood songs. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|A pure sonic blend of beautiful, sweeping guitar-driven melodies, a step up over A Rush of Blood. An earful of nirvanic bliss, mixing the ethereal u2ish guitars with vocals resembling radiohead's cousin, who happens to be in love. Amazing
0312323859|5.0|I don't normally read fiction but I am trying to venture out and I loved Something Borrowed and Something Blue.  I am a 35 year old female and it hit so many realistic cords about life, the past, and friendships that I couldn't put either book down.  I have given them to my best friend to read and she just emailed me that she was hooked too.  Excellent!!
B00097DX3U|1.0|ok, lets listen to a bunch of pointless songs with horrible guitar mush in the background.  CRAP!!
B0000033OZ|4.0|And with the vicious roar of Greg Lakes fuzz-bass, ELP serves notice that it was a musical force to be reckoned with. What better way to start of ELP's stunning debut disc than with the stomping, monstrous \\"The Barbarian\\" (an adaption of a Bela Bartok piece). All 3 members are giving it all they got, with breakneck tempo, instrument and genre' changes (moving freely from stomping rock to frenetic jazz-stylings at the drop of a hat for instance), firey interplay and a take no prisoners attitude.  <br /> <br />Next up is Greg Lake's \\"Take A Pebble\\", a longer, more introspective piece that would've also fit well on his former group King Crimson's debut album. Lake's impassioned and detailed vocals are buoyed by Emerson's rippling piano and Palmer's tasteful percussion atmospheres. The only thing that mars this piece is a rambling acoustic guitar section that doesn't have much of anything to do with the main body of the song, editing would've been good here.  <br /> <br />\\"Knife Edge\\" (with thematic material borrowed from Janaczek), kicks things back into high gear with Lake's clever wordplay and Emerson's fire 'n brimstone orgn assaults keeping you on the edge of your seat.  <br /> <br />\\"The Three Fates\\" is Keith Emerson's time to shine, utilizing his grand piano and a monstrous pipe organ in a harrowing ride through twisty jazz and classical stylings, his improvisational ability really comes to the fore here, something that ELP largely excelled at onstage.  <br /> <br />\\"Tank\\" is Carl Palmer's turn at the spotlight with his furious drumming levelling everything in its path and ending with Emerson's wall of synths march. <br /> <br />However, things close on a rather cheesy note with \\"Lucky Man\\". Apparently, the band's repetoire wasn't gigantic at this point, so Greg Lake, in desparation dug up a song he'd written as a teenager. Sure, it's reasonably catchy but it really sticks out like a sore thumb compared to everything else.  <br /> <br />Certainly not a perfect debut, but one that does unashamedly show both the band's strengths and weaknesses, thankfully here, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. <br /> <br />Very highly recommended.
B00005MEPV|1.0|I love Star Wars.  I waited years and years to see the next installment.  I watched PHANTOM MENACE on midnight the day it opened.<br />And I fell asleep.  <br />Sure, there are dazzling special effects, but that alone doesn't make a good film.  Story and character do.  What the first three Star Wars films had is sorely lacking from this episode.  Lucas spends all his time explaining the story instead of presenting us drama.  Drama is conflict.  Good guys vs. bad.  Where's the conflict here?  Who's the bad guy?  Where's the good guy?<br />Oh yeah, he's that smart-ass little kid running around with that  shameful, racist caricature, Jar Jar Binks. <br />May the force be with you -- you'll need it.
B00005B36H|5.0|Since 1996's junior album, \\"Aenima,\\" Tool escaped Zoo records and frontman Maynard James Keenan formed a side project, A Perfect Circle. Rumors of Tool's breakup started to circulate, but then, in 2001, Tool return with their fourth offering, \\"Lateralus.\\" An album, which was originally entitled \\"Systema Encephale,\\" was probably the most highly anticipated release of 2001.<br /><br />The five years it took to make this album sure paid off. Every moment of it seems very well planned out, perfected and ahead of its time. If I could describe \\"Lateralus\\" in one word, it would be \\"astonishing.\\" It is heavy, yet breathtakingly melodic. Polished and soothing in places, yet it is also rigid. In addition to being Tool's most futuristic sounding record, it is also their most experimental, adventurous, and brilliantly written. Some Tool fans were displeased because the new album wasn't as aggressive as their past works. This is true; \\"Lateralus\\" is the band's most progressive piece to date, but it also has the best production. Compared to \\"Lateralus,\\" \\"Aenima\\" sounds muddy. Every musical note on \\"Lateralus\\" is crystal clear, so clear that feedback is even audible on songs like \\"Parabola.\\" And being the most progressive album has also made it Tool's prettiest and most atmospheric artwork to date. Granted, guitarist Adam Jones isn't allowed as many good riffs on this album, but he can still make crazy sound effects with his instrument.<br /><br />Plus, Maynard shows a newfound vulnerability, here. He sings, whines, mewls, and even whispers a little. Couple this with the aforementioned penetrable and gentle music, and the result is 13 very smooth and harmonic songs.<br /><br />1. The Grudge-This song begins with what sounds like a machine starting up, then the drums and guitar come aboard. The drums sometimes sound like tin drums, and the guitars begin by making a low, repetitive, humming noise. The guitars gain in volume and make this song build very well. Maynard's vocals alternate from almost whispering, to singing, to laying down a 20 second long yell. This song takes up eight and a half of the C.D.'s 79 minutes<br /><br />2. Eon Blue Apocalypse- Just an interlude with some simple guitar plucking.<br /><br />3. The Patient- I enjoy how this song goes up and down repeatedly. The guitars sometimes make almost a wah-wah noise and the drums almost sound aquatic.<br /><br />4. Mantra- A spooky sounding interlude of whales bellowing back and forth to each other.<br /><br />5. Schism- The famous lead single which is a math metal song, and is brilliant even for Tool. Adam Jones plays some complex, winding guitar notes which makes the guitar sound like it's saying \\"I know the pieces fit\\" (which is Maynard's main line in this song). The guitars occasionally veer off into stop-start riffing, but then there's a beat change and the song goes back to the beginning.<br /><br />6. Parabol- This song is basically an interlude/lead in to track seven, \\"Parabola;\\" but it's also a good song in it's own right. Soft, dreary guitar strumming and distant, echo-y vocals make it have a very dreamy feel.<br /><br />7. Parabola- A heavier song, especially heavy compared to its predecessor. This, the second single to come off of this album, has some good drumming and a couple of crunchy riffs. But Maynard doesn't yell; he sings melodically.<br /><br />8. Ticks & Leeches- It begins with a drum intro, before Maynard lets loose a yell of: \\"Suck it!\\" In this song, Maynard is a lot more pissed off than the music. Maynard continues raging throughout this song, but his yells become so distant, around the three and a half minute mark, that he could be whispering. At this time, there are some wind whooshes in addition to a soft guitar (which sounds like it's acoustic). This part of the song stops, the power chords come back, and Maynard lays down some ascending yells of: \\"I hope you choke!\\"<br /><br />9. Lateralis- Opens with what sounds like a tin sheet being shaken, beforesegueing into some \\"ner nah ner\\" guitar noise. It ends with Maynard singing: \\"Spiral down...keep going.\\" These lyrics are fitting, because the last part of this song has some winding guitar noise which makes the beat spiral downward.<br /><br />10. Disposition- A personal favorite. Soft but clear guitar strumming, feather-light hand percussion (which sounds like they could be tribal drums), and harmonic crooning make this song very soothing and suave. Maynard sings pretty much just one line throughout this song: \\"Watch the weather change,\\" and the song ends with what sounds like a ball bouncing. This would make a cool and very trippy music video, too bad it's not a single.<br /><br />11. Reflection- The beginning has a bouncy rhythm with floor toms and some soft, fading guitar strings. What sounds like an Indian woman sings a little bit before Maynard begins his vocals around the three and a half minute mark. These vocals are pushed to the background because this track is mainly an instrumental.<br /><br />12. Triad- An instrumental. It begins with ascending guitars and drums, and the rest of the song is pretty much all one speedy, churning riff.<br /><br />13. Faaip de Oiad- Following over two minutes of silence, some static and other white noise and a background drum beat begin and run throughout this song. A hysterical voice eventually comes on and talks about \\"extra terrestrial beings.\\" This voice, who was actually a person who claimed to have worked at Area 51, made a call to Art Bell's radio program in 1997. The song becomes very eerie when he says things like \\"The government knows about them.\\"<br /><br />Everybody thought\\"Aenima\\" couldn't be topped, but then Tool surprised everybody by doing so. \\"Lateralus\\" is a masterpiece. It is Tool at their pinnacle; I don't think they can top this almost indescribably beautiful work of art...but then again, I was wrong about \\"Aenima,\\" so who knows what they're capable of? The bottom line is, as of 2005, this is the best album of the new millennium, and I can't foresee anyone making a set of songs better than these in the near future.r\\" guitar noise.

B0001KZM3O|4.0|First off, I side with Roger Waters on the whole Waters/Gilmour issue.  Roger Waters continues to sell out where ever he goes and Gilmour doesn't have the guts to go out under his own name.  Post Waters Pink Floyd albums were widely reported to be written by members outstide the band.  That being said, this album is much more about the lyrics than a collection of 'songs'.  It is obvious that Gilmour and Waters hate one another, and Waters simply is doing it his way.  I love the lyrics for When the Tigers Broke Free, Southhampton Dock and Final Cut.  If you listen to this album several times and let them sink in, you will find yourself loving this album.  If you listen once and set aside, you will think it is a piece of garbage.  Do yourself a favor and try it.  The Final Cut destroys all the post Waters albums.  I don't care what Grafton Tanner thinks. <br /> <br />
B000000OTY|5.0|This album is one of the greatest achievements of Gabriel's career.  The energy and emotion from the stage is perfectly translated into a layered and deeply moving musical experience.  The sound quality is superb and Gabriel is on top of his game.  Also notable is the set list.  It is not your typical greatest hits + a few obscure new songs, but rather the concert flows like a conversation, almost leading the listener into believing that she is listening to a concept album.  I always have this album in my short stack of music, and I anticipate that it will live there permanently.  Buy this! and enjoy. If you like it, check out Sting's \\"Bring on the Night\\" which is also a superb and unbelievable live album.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I just got done seeing it for a fourth time and I've got to say the more and more I see it, the more and more I love it.  In my opinion it's by far the best Batman.  I can't wait for the sequel.  If you haven't seen this movie, go see it.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|i originally wrote a pretty harsh review for this album, but i gave it another chance and i'm glad i did. has some great moments here, my least fav is still the third track 'no more lies' that one i still skip, but rest is pretty good, and by the way \\"kid\\" i cut my 'mullet' off a long time ago.
B00005OWEG|1.0|What was once a perfect film in every aspect has been butchered by it's own makers... It's so painful to see and sit through pointless scenes when there is so much texture that was once there in the tight editing, brutal violence, and depictions of war. Why instead, do we cut to a 30 minute waste of time that is debating politics in foreign language (the plantation). Why do we cut out the napalm ending and leave only a subtext so deep you need to be on LSD to comprehend it's \\"hidden message\\"... Screw that. Screw this \\"redux\\" too, it's as bad as Greedo shooting first.
B000667FN8|4.0|HEY FOR ALL YOU SIMPLE PLAN HATERS OUT THERE...GO AND F*CK YOURSELF!!!!JERKS!! \\"Ewwwww they are just posers!\\" and \\"Oh my god they arent even musicains!\\" ect ect.(That was me mimicking SP haters btw). It sickens me, it really does, to see grown men and young children complainin about the band cause they THINK they're bad!!.You know wot? Get lost losers!!! See if you 'accidentaly' type in Simple Plan on Amazon you know theres an X at the top corner, do you see it? Then click it and dont waste your or anyone elses time okay?! I mean if you dont like a band dont spend all day tellin other people who DO like them that they're rubbish wannabes cause the fact is they dont give 2 f*cks cause they know their good. You Know there are ALOT of SP fans out there and if your not one of them it doesnt mean you tell others who are to GET A LIFE!! Take a good look as to who needs to go get one!! <br />Simple Plan mabye dont go into the \\"rock\\" category but hell they STILL play some GREAT music!! I first heard them cause of Welcome to My Life (WTML) on Kerrang! It didnt catch my attention the 1st time but a while later it came on again (Meaning people like it and want to hear it again. :0) and the second time I liked it. After I got that song I decided to try 2 other big songs by SP which I was told by other reviewers. So now i've got 3 of their biggest songs inculding WTML, Shut Up and Perfect World and they're all excellent!! I want to get their album now cause once again they are unique and WILL add more variety to my music collection. My pals say the suck but they obviously dont have good taste in music. But for me I think their pretty good and they are definetly NO rip off posers or terrible muscians!!! <br />So ONCE again I say to those sad, twisted f*ckers out there...................GET A DAMN LIFE!!! <br />Out.
B000001G7O|5.0|I love this recording of Anne-Sophie Mutter playing the Tchaikovsky. This recording is raw and uncut! I almost laughed while reading these opposing reviews, what a joke. Buy this album, Mutter, Karajan, and the Berlin Philharmonic, you can't get any better!
0515123447|4.0|I'm new to the Jack Reacher series but I have to say that I enjoyed this first book. I was interested in reading what other reviewers had to say: Author was charged with using the word \\"shrugged\\" too much. I never noticed, I was busy turning the pages I guess. Author was charged with using short, choppy sentences. Is that a literary offense? Because if it is, it's time to take Hemingway's work out and burn it, he having been critically lauded for years for that short, choppy style which is supposed to be very manly -- in a literary sense, I suppose. All I know is that I find old Hem's work mindnumbingly dull. At least Mr. Child keeps me awake, those choppy sentences lend a sense of urgency to the story. (Just like Earl Emerson's short chapters in 'Pyro'!) Author is charged with not being an expert on America. Neither am I and I've spent 48 out of 50 years here. Oh, and one review bemoaned the fact that somehow the author failed to realize the US has no Marines stationed in Europe, that we have no naval base there. Hm, I don't keep up with the exact locations of all US bases but I spent two years at Zaragoza Air Base, Spain, and when I was there, the US had a naval base at Rota. Author is charged with having a written a very violent book. Well. There you have me. It IS violent. If violence disturbs you, what the heck are you doing reading books in this genre in the first place? There was a great honking picture of a bloody handprint on the cover of the paperback I bought -- I would have thought that was a (you'll excuse the pun) dead giveaway as to the nature of this book. Oh, almost forgot. The author is also charged with too much coincidence in the brother/killing plot point. Stranger things happen every day -- gee, Bush got elected twice. I think THAT's stretching coincidence! <br /> <br />Yes, Jack Reacher is an anti-hero. Yes, the books has some flaws (as most every book I've ever read does). But I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to seeing Reacher's character progression in the next book. Do I think he's the next Lucas Davenport? Nope, not unless he gets a stronger sense of humor and a lot more sexy. But Reacher is verrrry interesting! <br /> <br />OK, I'm done defending the book. Now, here's the bit that bothered me: A top gun in the Treasury Dept drops out of sight and the Feds don't swarm all over looking for him when his prints come across the computer? A second Treasury Dept worker is brutally murdered in an airport and (1) it's the busy airport at Atlanta and no one sees it??? and (2) the Feds don't follow up on this either?  Still -- I was able to suspend my disbelief long enough to overlook these things, just because I wanted to see what Jack would do next.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|As an album, it just doesn't stack up against the Foo's earlier releases.  There is really no flow, few hooks or melodies, weird recording that hides alot of the guitar colorings that were so prominent on The Color and the Shape, and WAY too much screaming (Yes Dave, we can hear you screaming.  Now stop it.)... Yet despite all of these annoyances, rather miraculously, I still like this cd! <br /> <br />Perhaps because \\"DOA\\" is an incredible song.  I have listened to this song literally 50 times in the last 10 days.  I can't get enough of it!  \\"No Way Back\\" comes in second at about 10 listens... the rest of the album maybe 3 times through.  (Except for the title track, which is absolutely horrendous.) <br /> <br />As for copy protection goes, it takes about 2 minutes to get around if you have half a brain in your head.  So give it a few minutes of your attention before you go shooting your mouth off in your reviews.
B00005YU1O|2.0|There are a lot of very interesting ideas discussed in this movie. However, this sort of philosophical smorgasboard would be better experienced on paper, as the film doesn't really allow ample time to for these discussions to be absorbed by the viewer, especially if the viewer is not experienced in the philosophical thought process.  <br /> <br />The visuals are stunning, but can hinder one somewhat from fully understanding the ideas before the film moves on to the next idea. I found it very frustrating to try to fully comprehend certain ideas presented, only to be bombarded with even more equally intense dialogue and visuals.  <br /> <br />The ideas presented are certainly fascinating, and are framed with some of the most beautiful visuals I've ever seen in a film, but the combination of the two can be quite overwhelming. I'd prefer to read a script, if one exists, and take my time contemplating these usually complex philosophical meanderings. Film is simply not a suitable medium, unless the viewer is already familiar with the ideas presented.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I just bought this CD and listened to the entire thing a couple times. This album surpasses Audioslave's first, and in my opinion by a wide margin. The riffs seem to be heavier, the songs more passionate, and overall the music seems to flow from one track to the next. The album's title is \\"Out of Exile\\" but Tom Morello should be kicked out of the band and be put into exile. While his influence seems to be less on this album than on the first, his screeching riffs get old quickly. Cornell seems to have had a bigger hand in this album and many of the songs remind me of Soundgarden. I didn't skip through tracks at all, which I usually do with every other CD, including Audioslave's first. While \\"rating\\" art is a purely subjective affair, this is an excellent album and I am glad to own it now.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Robot/ Hive Exodus will be the album of 2005 hands down.  Clutch has built upon the brilliance that was Blast Tyrant and added a bluesy element for a true jam rock album beginning to end.  I've been a long time Clutch fan and appreciate how the band and their sound has evolved.  Critics who want the same sounding songs on each album should listen to bands like Disturbed instead.  Me, I appreciate a new sound and RHE is very much appreciated.  There isn't one bad song on this cd.  This will stay in my player for months to come.  Thank you Clutch for kicking out the jams.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|This album has got a creepy quirky feel that I like about it. I actually get into this more than \\"Songs for the deaf\\", because I find it a bit less easy listening and more experimental, which is the stuff I like. While there may not be an anthemic \\"no one knows\\", tracks like \\"medication\\" \\"little sister\\" \\"in my head\\" the 2 haunting \\"tangled up in plaid\\" and \\"someone's in the wolf\\" and the gorgeous \\"i never came\\" certainly make up for it. I haven't listened to Rated R yet but am tempted to. Josh Holmes and the band rock. The departure of the other guy is not a problem for me. Quite on the contrary I enjoy more Josh's singing than Nick's screaming, and I don't think Queens have lost in bass...Dark, twisted, everybody knows that you're insane!!!!!!!
B0009K7RES|4.0|This is a slightly tricky release to review.  On one hand, if you're a big fan of Mark's solo work like myself; you're going to really dig this EP.  I still play Shangri-La (the album which 7 of these songs came from) regularly and to hear these tunes in a \\"live\\" setting is a refreshing change.  However, if you are new to Mr. Knopfler, you'd be better off picking up his Shangri-la album. <br /> <br />On to the actual content- the songs here are remarkably faithful to their original versions.  While that is an impressive feat, the music here is almost too close to it's original form.  The sound quality is fantastic, with just enough ambience to let you know that this was recorded live.  Mark himself said much of the Shangri-La album was recorded in a live setting, so like I already said- don't expect too much variation here.    <br /> <br />There are three songs that stand out to me as being `better' than the original album cuts.  The opening \\"Trawlerman's Song\\" really benefits from Mark's excellent guitar tone cutting through a little louder and clearer than on the Shangri-La album.  Mark gives a great vocal performance on \\"Song for Sonny Liston\\"- you can almost hear him smirking as he delivers the lyrics... very nice.  Last but not least, \\"Donegan's Gone\\" manages to swing even better than the album cut- it just really comes to life here.  It's something you have to hear to understand. <br /> <br />All things considered, I really dig this release.  Excellent sound quality, great performances and a really strong vocal and guitar performance from Mark.  The rest of the band sounds great as well, with the drums really coming through nicely with this live mix.  I really wish this was a full album release rather than an EP (it's just too short), but hopefully Mark is saving the full live experience for an upcoming live album/dvd. <br /> <br />If you loved Shangri-La, buy this EP.  If you're new to Mark, check out Shangri-La or any of Mark's other solo albums first (I strongly recommend Sailing to Philadelphia).
0767805712|5.0|I think everything that could be said about this movie has been said by the other reviewers. I just wanted to add that even when the story itself is interesting and well developed enough to sustain the movie, the actors certainly do a marvelous job in all their parts specially Jude Law as the cynical,crippled \\"valid\\" that finds redemption too at the end of the film. His final words : I only lended You my body, You gave me Your dreams... It's worth the viewing itself....
B00005JO9J|3.0|Grays Anatomy is not a pimple on denny Crane's big fat ass. As a hospital show It it worse than ER. Worse than St. Elsewhere. Worse than Scrubs. I do give it a slight edge on General Hospital, but I am sure this is only because of the respective budgets involved. The Seattle tie in is NOT realistic and badly done. As is typical you can see the Pike market sign out the hospital window and the writers toss in Seattle buzz words inappropriately. Some jerk-off middle management type at ABC has his carrier on the line over the success of Greys and knows it can only make it on the coattails of Desperate Housewives.
0060977493|5.0|I read this book after listening to Terri Gross interview the author on NPR...when was that-1997?  I went and got the book and was reborn as a booklover.  Have you ever loved something so much that every compliment, every word of praise, almost everything applies to it?  I read food advertisements and think- that's how I feel about The God Of Small Things!  \\"Perfect if you yearn for full, robust flavor but not the fat that comes with it--packed with coarse ground emotion that gives you a chance to absorb the woodsy aroma and hearty, but still delicate, flavor.\\"  or, I thought of it recently while reading about cirque du soleil...I was thinking that Roy's novel was also a \\"joyous procession\\" of characters who, with \\"power, grace and passion\\", brought us a world \\"situated in a mysterious space between heaven and earth\\".  \\"Juxtaposing the large with the small, the ridiculous with the tragic... it highlights the strength and fragility...wisdom and kindness\\" of the family \\"to illustrate the portion of humanity that lies within us\\".  Her writing, \\"by turns lyrical and playful carries us through a timeless story in which illusion teases reality\\".  OK, enough with the quotes--<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. for the story.  for the language.  for how I felt while reading and how I feel today.  I could not get enough of this voice that seemed to open another door to the english language where words kept unfolding into new meanings and sentences were freed from the constraints of our expectations.  People sometimes talk of THE BOOK that changed their lives--now I understand.
0060977493|5.0|I have a very hard time finding writers and novels that move me enough to keep me reading past page 50.  I have picked up countless works of fiction suggested to me by like minded friends who's opinions I value greatly, only to become bored, dissatsified and disconnected within the first few chapters and abandoning the story altogether.  I stumbled across this book in an airport bookstore and instantly became enraptured with the language and immersed in the story of these lovely children. However, this book is not for everyone.  I believe that you must be able to think like the author in order to enjoy their writing.  I actually write in this lyrical/prose fashion myself so, when I find that rare author who sees the world in the way that I do,  I become an instant fan.  If you prefer plot driven fiction told in a straight forward fashion, this book is not for you.  If however, you enjoy losing yourself in a world of metaphor and simile, if you find the idea of a writer who employs all of their senses to draw you into their world an exciting prospect, then pick up this wonderful novel.   It really is a treat.
B0009IW88A|3.0|Well, I had high expectations for this score.  I'm a huge fan of James, and I like Hans Zimmer when he's working with an orchestra(Gladiator).  And I also must say, you can't compare this score to Danny Elfman's score.  If you would ask me which score was better, I would say Danny Elfman's.  But I don't believe you can compare them, because the movies went in two  different directions, so it's unfair to compare them even though so many people do.  So anyways, on with the score.  It's good, but nothing to hurry and buy kind of score.  It has it's moments, like Corynorhinus, which is a dark and beautiful piece.  I would seriously buy the cd just for this cue alone.  The rest of it has some moments hear and there, but nothing as spectacular as Corynorhinus.  You can also tell where each composer had more influence on a scene.  I think that hurt the score rather then helped.  My biggest gripe with this score is that it drags and doesn't connect throughout.  Each piece is just kinda there.  It also has no climax at all, which bothers me a little.  But overall, i'd give the score a 3.5, but not a 4.  It's not a great score, but it's not a bad score either.  If you can find a way to hear Corynorhinus, do it and you will know why that piece is worth buying the whole score. I hope this helps.
B00082IJ08|2.0|This album was unfortunately already made by a true rock band, trust me i love the gorillaz, but Pink Floyd produced this album under another name 20 years ago. So if you wanna hear the original recording, buy Dark Side of the Moon.
B000646MNE|5.0|What is it about \\"Sex and the City\\" that makes us crave more? <br />Well, I will tell you--We are secretly living through these gorgeous, thin, sucessful, dangerous, party girls like there is no tomorrow. <br />I cannot get enough--Does that mean I have a void to fill in my own life? <br />I mean, I absolutely love it when Charlotte, Carrie, Samantha, and Mirannda dress up, (especially Carrie and Samantha) in their Gucci, Prada, and their high-heeled \\"Screw me\\" shoes, visiting all of the expensive restaurants in New York City. <br />I love it when these four girlfriends meet for a day of shopping, sip Pink Cosmos and encounter striking men. <br />In reality, we would call women who sleep around sluts, but somehow when these four women do it--it seems, well, alright, cool, and exhilarating in some way. And with no consequence, really. <br />Do we want a life like these four girlfriends? <br />Do we want to drink sweet cosmos all day and have wild sex all night? <br />Do we want to exist in the heart and pulse of New York City like their is no tomorrow? <br />Well, do you? <br />HELL YES!

B0009NSE1K|5.0|The musical perfection continues with Robot Hive / Exodus! You can never go wrong with a Clutch record. They not only continue to mature, but evolve each time they hit the studio. They bring a new definition to the phrase \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\\" That is what Clutch does. The theme and music may change with each new record, but the proverbial Clutch sound is always intact. From the angry, the futuristic, the Civil War past, the jamming, the instrumental side band,  the fury of pure rock and roll, the live show, the rarities,  and the stories of the Blast Tyrant and the Worm Drink, they now bring you the corruption of the robot church and its cleansing by the new robot messenger. RH/E brings pure rock and roll with the elements of groove, funk, blues, and jazz all mixed into one beautiful work of art. One minute heavy, another groovy, but all catchy and %100 Clutch.   <br />  <br />      This is an excellent follow-up to Blast Tyrant. The fab 4 of Neil Fallon, Tim Sult, Dan Maines, and Jean Paul Gaster is now 5 strong with new keyboardist Mick Schauer joining the fold. The keyboards mixed with the groove of the bass and drums really does enhance the already great tunes and even sounds well with the great guitar playing of Sult. The production here is great and the artwork is definitely amazing. For those of you who have not been keeping your CD's in their cases for the last ten years just might want to keep this CD in this case, because the artwork really adds to the charm of the music the disc spins for its listeners. Gravel Road and the cover of Howlin' Wolf's Who's Been Talking? are very pleasant surprises to the album, showing off the musical talents of the band.  <br />  <br />      To those long-dead Clutch fans who stopped listening to Clutch at the release of The Elephant Riders just because they are \\"no longer angry\\" are really missing out on a life-pleasing rock and roll experience of the mature and multi-talented Clutchof the present. To those skeptical due to the increased religious references in the lyrics should not take them at face value. Long time Clutch fans are well aware of the vagueness ever present in Fallon's words, knowing full well they could have hundreds of different meanings. Take what you will from them and do not let that ruin your listening enjoyment. These lyrics are pure Clutch all the way. Fallon has always been a great story teller and let these stories tuck you into bed and kiss you goodnight after they kick your a-- and make you bob your head and dance a jig.  <br />  <br />      Once you have picked up this CD you need to go hear these songs played live because I cannot stress enough the raw power of a Clutch live show. If you are skeptical in joining Clutch's fanatical fanbase, then seeing them live will definitely convince you. This is not an MTV band! This is not a TRL band! This is rock and roll in its purist form. The self-titled seems will always be my favorite, but Neil says it best, \\"Get your evolution on!\\" <br />
B00005JMEW|3.0|An intersting use of 70's past orthodoxy Martial Arts films, from language to aesthetics to music, with the inclusion of what may be considered current attractiveness with the female characters in the film, who take prominance as far as major roles are concerned. \\"The Bride/Black Mamba\\" {a blonde Uma Thurman} must gain vengeance for injustuces levelled against her which takes her all the way to Japan, where she trains with a Samurai Master to prepare for a duel to the death with her nemesis, an Amerasian beauty who leads a network of Yakuza. She is presented with a special katana sword likened a veritable Excalibur for this purpose. Vignettes illustrate the personal circumstances of the major characters which lead to their paths of battle, and cross-interpolations between the other warrior women.<br /><br />David Carradine {Kwai Chang Caine himself} acts as a sort of \\"Bosley\\" to a secret organization of sexy assassins reminiscent of \\"Charlie's Angels\\", whom he leads to eliminate certain threats to his organization, which initially included The Bride who fell into a coma, although because of the Bushido code, is spared in favor of an eventual honorable bout. While in her coma, she is raped repeatedly by an orderly named \\"Chuck\\", who had begun bringing others for this pseudo-necrophiliac activity. She gains her revenge against them as well.<br /><br />The Bride wears a yellow jumpsuit with the black line up the side, a-la Bruce Lee, during a mass cluster fight with black-suited subordinates, and the protagonist are female, eventually meeting in a ridiculously bloody battle between she and the villainess' forces, which includes a cutely psychotic schoolgirl and a military general. The bloodshed spurts like jet fountains, and reminded Me of the scene in The Addams Family wherein Wednesday and Pugsley were performing at the PTA event, with the words \\"A hit! A very palpable hit!\\" comes to mind.<br /><br />Overall, an impressive \\"scalping\\" occurs, an impalement, and various ubiquitous feats of extraordinary acrobatics.d various ubiquitous feats of extraordinary acrobatics.
B00097A5HW|4.0|I don't really know a word of Spanish, but I've been a fan of Shakira since her MTV Unplugged performance.  Keeping this short, this CD is full of hook-driven pop music.  There really isn't a dud track, and there are four huge keepers in \\"La Pared,\\" \\"La Tortura,\\" \\"En Tus Pupilas,\\" and \\"No.\\"  Her voice is huge and variable.  Singing in Spanish is her comfort zone.  Trust me, if you even kind of liked her English cross-over album, you will love this CD.  Even if you don't understand the words she's saying.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|My opinion might be biased. I like every single song Dream Theater has ever written, and I'm finding this album to be no exception. <br /> <br />As with every Dream Theater album, the first few listens had me thinking, \\"What the heck?\\" This is because we all put in a new CD in the player with certain expectations of what it should be, and we anxiously listen, waiting for the \\"cool parts,\\" which basically means the parts that sound like previous DT material. Even long-time Dream Theater fans like myself do this, even though experience should have taught me that it takes many listens before the composition becomes even the slightest bit understood. <br /> <br />The lesson: Relax. Quit waiting for the cool parts and let yourself absorb it slowly. This disc is rather sparse on crunchy riffs, flying solos, and soaring harmonies, so some patience is required. The entertainment value of Octavarium is not intense and immediate, but I assure you it is there. Dream Theater has always been critisized for being too eager to show off their skills, so they've taken a minimalist approach and they're aiming to impress with their songwriting and composition skills. With this album, DT has proven that they're not wankers, and that they don't need to play entirely in 64th notes to be entertaining.
B00005QDW5|4.0|...Pink Floyd's actual albums (especially those contained within the \\"Golden Era\\" - Meddle, Dark Side, Wish, Animals and Wall) are meant to be heard as albums in themselves, and although this comprehensive collection offers a good glance at the band's material, trouble is encountered in making the tracks flow at anything but an obdurate rate. The defining factor in this is how the band's sound changed drastically with each album, causing the songs to flow better chronologically, which is what this compilation avoids doing right. <br /> <br />With the bad out of the way (I did rate it 4 stars, after all), the song choices are excellent, and reflect the band at their best at the various stages in their spectacular career, from Piper at the Gates of Dawn (Astronomy Domine, Bike), to their two best albums, Dark Side of the Moon (Time, Money, Us & Them, Great Gig in the Sky) and Wish You Were Here (Shine on You Crazy Diamond, Wish You Were Here), and finally choice cuts from their last 3 Waters-era albums, Animals (Sheep), The Wall (Happiest Days of Our Lives, Another Brick Pt.II, Hey You, Comfortably Numb). In addition, Floyd's albums \\"sans-Rogers\\" are represented here by Sorrow, Learning to Fly, High Hopes and Marooned. <br /> <br />While this remains the perfect choice for the casual fan, the compilation's lack of continuity hinders the experience of a seasoned fan.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|All those who have adored the Illiad as I have over many years can readily find the shortcomings in Peterson's \\"Troy\\" when compared to the source material. Comparisons between the Illiad and \\"Troy\\" are really not productive.  This is a film made in 21st century USA, financed by investors seeking a return on capital invested.  They have a right to that return, having taken the risk attendant to the production, beset by hurricanes, competitors, injuries and the like.  <br /> <br />In contrast, the Illiad was created by one or more authors in pre-Homeric times and recorded in Homeric times.  I would encourage readers of this review to examine Julian Jaynes' \\"The Origin of Conciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\\" as a means of understanding the mindset of pre-Homeric humans. The loss of the gods as external impetus in \\"Troy\\" seems to be in the service of accommodating a modern, uninitiated audience. This is the big audience, and they buy a lot of tickets and DVD's.  I much prefer Isabella Rosselini as a transcendant Athena in \\"The Odyssey\\" (1998 Konchalovsky) to a complete lack of Olympian intervention in the affairs of humans, but that is not available to us here.  Keep in mind that there is no effort on the part of the director or screenwriters to present this film as \\"The Illiad.\\" <br /> <br />What happened instead during the filming of this very commendable, but not flawless film was the transformation of one actor from a cool, funny guy who has a versatile range (Brad Pitt, as Achilles) to someone who deserves comparisons to Brando and Burton - keep going.  After watching this film many times I feel prepared to offer this:  After desecrating the temple of Apollo, the Burtonish delivery is \\"Go home Prince of Troy - etc .. it is too early in the day for killing princes.\\"  And further - regard the scene after Patroklus is dead, and Eudorus is tasked with delivering that message.  Look at the range of emotions that Pitt displays in one concise scene - emerging from his tent very satisfied with his concubine Briseis (faithful to the source material) confronting the idea that his men were deployed against his command - then realizing in one startling moment of revelation - that his hubris has brought disaster to Patroklus (cousin - lover, whatever the relationship as we would describe it today) - his intime, his adoptive brother, the source of his \\"unmanly grief\\" as described in the source material, as well as to the whole nascent Greek nation. The emotions playing across Pitt's face tell everything there is to know about his mastery of the craft of acting. Brando would be envious of the native cunning in this portrayal of what Pitt has interpreted as a complex and tragic hero.  Nothing defines the classics as much as that simple trajectory in one's life events as those which bring Achilles to glory and then to his doom, on the wings of the selfsame impulse. Thus is the tragedy of heros wrought .. <br /> <br />On top of that, the battle scenes are tremendous, not only in concept but in execution.  Pitt and Eric Bana were extraordinary, as the fight choreographer's tools, in conveying the ferocity of the fights that might have taken place beneath the the walls of Troy.   <br /> <br />The mass battles are scarily realistic (a few CG ship scenes notwithstanding) and speak of nothing more than the excess capacity found in many societies in the form of young men with nothing better to do than to kill each other in artful ways, once given the chance.  <br /> <br />But Pitt and Bana create a beautiful ballet of slaughter in their desire to eliminate each other.  Nevermind that in the Illiad, Hector has to be tricked into standing his ground against Achilles - in this version he is given a nobler and very sad end - saying goodbye to brother, father, wife and child before facing his certain death at the hands of a superior adversary. There are not many more poignant scenes than Hector \\"leaving youth and manhood behind\\" as he isunstrung by the \\"swift footed Achilles\\"  who is clearly in a league of his own as fighter and indeed as a force of nature, as another reviewer has opined in this same forum.  <br /> <br />The extraordinary sadness and beauty of this film, in this reviewer's opinion, has given Pitt a vehicle that he may not have anticipated as having the degree of influence over his life as he might have anticipated.  Pitt seems like a very seasoned  spirit, as evidenced in his handling of the suffering attendant to his great fame and fortune, and as displayed in his recent interview with Diane Sawyer.    <br /> <br />Pitt's apparently intuitive connection with the trajectory of Achilles' fame and suffering parallels his own trajectory in the public eye, in this reviewer's opinion.  15 minutes will not really be the measure of this large spirited man who is only now plumbing the depths of what he might be able to show us of the human condition.   <br /> <br />Let us only hope that he finds material as challenging as \\"Troy\\" and that he is able to bring to us the goofy and sweet person that his ex-wife claims him to be in her accounts of him.  Check out \\"Johnny Suede\\" if you really need convincing.  Very Goofy - regards - DS <br /> <br />
078693123X|5.0|For me, this is the book that started it all. The Crystal Shard, with all of its heroics, never grasped me in the same way. Homeland covers the birth and the treacherous upbringing of the world's favorite dark elf - Drizzt Do'Urden.    Salvatore's writing shines here; it's charming, fun, and quick. His characters clash with deviousness and purity. Drizzt is, throughout, tortured by his morals. He can only console in Guenhwyvar, his cat.    There are battles between the houses of Menzoberranzan, clashes with dwarves, and the slaughtering of surface elves.     Even with their vileness, Drizzt still has feelings for many of his family members. He doesn't want to disappoint them, but what they ask of him is too much. Even the reader will find many characters to like here, despite their malevolence.    For Forgotten Realms fans, Homeland is a must. For Salvatore fans, it is a must. Even general fantasy fans will find much to enjoy here.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|I had not heard of these guys until I started listening to the album while waiting for my wife to find a book she was looking for at Borders. Man I am glad I did.  <br /> <br />I have always had a soft spot for metal and have been disappointed with most recent popular metal. System of Down being an exception to that......These guys rock. The mix of orchestra, choir and a rock band all come together very nicely.  <br /> <br />My favourites are songs 1,2,3,6 and 9. I would give this a 5 but master lyricists they are not.  <br /> <br />Cheers. <br /> <br />Scott
0062502182|3.0|This was a highly recommended book in my class. Inspirational, beautifully written, thoughtful, enchanting. Well, I guess I was just a little bit disappointed then. I was expecting a lot and instead, all I got was a half-empty glass. There are definitely moments in this book that make you wonder why the author doesn't write as eloquently on other instances that desperately require them. And it's just a terrible shame because the alchemist does have something special about it. The problem is that the author chops down on details that need to be written, on words that need to be said and moments that should have been given more time. It is because of this that some things come out a bit flat and unconvincing for me. To the author's credit, I did breeze through this book like it was a magazine. It was such an easy read from start to finish. Then again, maybe it's because of the size of the text and the blatant use of double spacing to give volume to a very slim book. But hey, if I'm being too critical, it's only because I wanted the story to be so much more. The premise was strong and I really felt that I could connect with the characters and the world after only a couple of pages. But everything is so half-baked and unfinished, it feels like I'm only reading an overview of the story instead getting of the real deal. Ah, well, at the very least, this book is worth a read if you're in a plane or waiting for the school bus to arrive. Yeah, that's probably the right amount of time to finish this book.
B000002HMH|5.0|I love Metallica, i have all of thier albums, yes even St. Anger. While St. Anger is not good, Load and Re-Load are not bad albums. Many people would prefer that Metallica had stayed the same and kept rehashing thier old stuff. Load and Re-Load are NOT heavy metal like thier older albums and the songs aren't 9 minute metal epics. These two albums have a darker, mellower, more Alternative feel to them while maintaining Metallica's signature sound. I can understand how a narrowminded \\"heavy metal only\\" person couldn't accept these albums, but people with a taste for all kinds of rock music, be it punk, metal, alternative, grunge, etc. should be able to appreciate these two albums for what they are, genuinely GOOD albums!
0765348780|5.0|Some people love him, some people hate him: Steven Erikson, author of Malazan. Me? Well, I like him. Here's why:    Gardens of the Moon doesn't waste any time. The prologue and first chapter sets the stage a bit - a little bit. The second chapter throws the reader headfirst into a steaming war. I won't bother to explain it.    This is the pitfall for many readers; Erikson explains little of the past and instead pushes the story forward. If one can just let go and be enthralled, this book will be a thrilling read. If not, this book will be a boring, backtracking trudge.    It depends on the reader. Let go and have a good time. If you can't do that, this book isn't for you.    Gardens of the Moon has some of the craziest battles ever seen in fantasy. Gods battle gods. Demigods battle demigods. Mortals battle mortals. Characters spout delightfully pulpy philosophy as these wars are waged.     Enjoy it or criticize it. That's your prerogative.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I'd never listened to a SOAD album before this one. I'd describe my first experiance listning to them as &quot;refreshingly weird.&quot; I've never listened to music like this before. Sure, I listen to a lot of metal, but I've never heard music manipulated like this until I came across this album. And I think what they do with the music kicks ass. I also love the interesting lyrics. The only downside I can think of about this album is that it's a bit on the short side.
B00005O3VC|1.0|But I thought this movie only succeeded on being dumb and pointless. Hard to fathom considering that it's supposed to be an inspired and comedic take on King Arthur. I popped the dvd expecting a witty, satirical parody based on what some friends told me. What I got was time taken away from what I could've been doing. Like, wrapping my nuts around copper wiring and testing it's conductivity with a lightning rod. I tried to watch through the entire thing but had to stop halfway through and finish it some other time because when I wasn't bored out of my mind, I was constantly picking on the stupidity of it all. I will come out and say that SOME bits at the very beginning were pretty funny in a silly-ass kind of way (the coconuts and the socialist peasant). But I would have to say that the humor just isn't there for me the rest of the way. Some border on infantile while others border on what the hell did I just see. It was that awful. Maybe the reason people revere this movie so much is because they defer to the comedy troupe. Well, then I would have to say thay this is the wrong movie to revere. I haven't seen any other monty python movie but hey, if they're all on the same level as this one then I'm pretty sure I'm not missing much.
B0000AZAUM|5.0|David Bowie is too hot. This CD is every bit as fabulous as the latest greatest hits album, which is now available. I bought this CD after that one, and the songs are terrific. Five Years and Rock and Roll Suicide are my favorite non greatest hits songs on here, but they are all great. Just buy it.
B000069CWE|5.0|There are good remix albums, and there are bad remix albums.  An example of a bad remix album would be \\"New Old Songs\\" by Limp Bizkit, with people like Puffdaddy and a million remixes of My Way.  A good example of a remix album would be Reanimation, which includes lesser known but far more talented artists. <br /> <br />Some people probably wrote off purchasing Reanimation because it's essentially a remix of the entire first Linkin Park album, Hybrid Theory.  But there's some great material on this CD, as well as some great special appearances from not only hip hop artists, but singers from other rock bands. <br /> <br />Here's a quick rundown of the tracks: <br /> <br />OPENING - This track sets a theme for the entire album, which gets brought back a few times during the CD.  It's really short but awesome.  The violin and piano are awesome. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />PTS.OF.ATHRTY - A great opening track to the CD, I like this song just as much as the original, if not a little bit more.  Nice techno beats and special effects. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />ENTH E ND - Pretty tight song.  While I like the original better, I like how Mike changed up the lyrics for this one to make it a little different.  Motion Man is pretty tight too. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />FRGT/10 - Really tight beat on this song, I actually like this version better than the original.  Nice raps from Chali 2na on this one. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />P5HNG ME A*WY - One of the best songs on the album, and another song I like better than the original.  The extra lyrics from Stephen Richards go well with the song and add even more emotion and feeling.  Also one of the tracks Mike produced himself. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />PLC.4 MIE HAED - Tight beat and tight rhymes.  I like the intro sample that loops at the beginning.  The piano is tight too. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />X-ECUTIONER STYLE - This song is an original song from the X-Ecutioners made for the album, mixing samples from several LP songs.  BlackThought is awesome on this track. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />H! VLTG3 - A remix of a remix lol but this is probably my favorite version of High Voltage.  Pharoahe Monch does some tight lyrics, and of course Mike's lyrics are tight (although still censored).  Great track. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />WTH>YOU - Pretty tight song, I like the techno-y feel of the song.  Aceyalone puts down some tight lyrics at the end. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />NTR\MSSION - An interlude to the next song, bringing back the theme of the first track.  Nice piano solo. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />PPR:KUT - Another great remix.  Some nice rhymes mixed with a darker hip hop feel than the original.  Still heavy on guitar though. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />RNW@Y - Didn't like this one as much as the original, but it's alright.  (4 out of 5) <br /> <br />MY>DSMBR - This track is awesome, I didn't like the original My December that much but I like the remix a lot. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />BY_MYSLF - I like the beat on this one.  Not my favorite song on the album but I like it slightly better than the original.  (4 out of 5) <br /> <br />KYUR4 TH ICH - Mr. Hahn (or Chairman Hahn lol) does a remix of his DJ track from Hybrid Theory.  It's pretty tight too. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />1STP KLOSR - Pretty tight remix featuring Jonathan Davis of Korn.  (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />KRWLNG - The beginning of the song sounds almost exactly like the first track, and features violin and cello throughout the song.  This has to be the best song on the album.  Aaron Lewis' voice blends in perfect harmony with Chester's singing.  The violin and cello (played by Phoenix) is very soothing and adds a lot of depth to an already emotional song.  Another song produced by Mike, it's the crowning jewel of Reanimation. (5 out of 5) <br /> <br />In short, I think that Reanimation is a great CD that Linkin Park fans should definitely check out.  Even if you don't like remix albums, there's a couple awesome songs on here (like P5HNG ME A*WY and KRWLNG).  And who knows, you might like the rest of the album too.
B00005ASOI|5.0|When I first bought Suspiria I watched it several times with a number of people and some enjoyed it, some were frightended by it, and some hated it in every way possible.  The people that would not like Suspiria would generally be the people that are used to american horror films and nothing more.      These are the people that will say that Suspiria is boring and dull with a bad script.  I am not the biggest fan of the script either but this is not a plot heavy movie.  It begins when Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives in Freiburg, Germany to attend the TanzAkademie (real place but has nothing to do with the movie).      Upon her arrival she sees a girl storm out of the akademie and flee through the black forest.  This is followed by the most famous murder scene of all time, seriously.      (...)
B000007T1M|4.0|That's probably the number of times I've slipped this cd into my car stereo. I love this album. It's ridiculously funny on some songs(sugar) and beautifully captivating on others(spiders). My personal favorite is \\"know\\", all I can say is that the song has more to it than it really leads one to believe. This almost seems to be the case on most of their songs but they get so obsequiously silly that it's hard to pay attention to anything else.  <br /> <br />This is the band's first album, Serj Tankian is vocally talented and not as politically charged here as on follow up efforts and Daron is pretty much kick ass all the way through. Some people dismiss this album as ridiculous and merely consistent on being knowingly stupid but I say it is pretty good for what it is. Pop metal infused with a dose of creativity and meandering misdirection. I love it.
B0000089FS|4.0|After having a number of lackluster and uninspired releases through the 1980s, with perhaps the lowest point being the 1986 release of \\"Leather Jackets,\\" Elton John started a turnaround in quality and artistry that was evident on this album, and would achieve albums such as \\"The One\\" and \\"Made in England\\" in the 90s.  While this album had much less quality and artistry than Elton's 70s albums, loyal fans were gratified to see that Elton could still write and sing good songs.<br /><br />Elton's rediscovered enthusiasm shows in \\"Town of Plenty.\\"  Admittedly this song is one of the lesser songs on this CD; the words are corny and simple, and the music is relatively simple.  However, Elton's voice sounds refreshed and clear, and the production is much improved over \\"Leather Jackets.\\"  This simple song is little indication of the music that comes later on this CD.<br /><br />The second song also has relatively simple words, though more complex and inspired than the words of the first song.  However, Elton's music in \\"A Word in Spanish\\" contains a flavor of that sound that made Elton John great in years gone by.  This song was also the longest song on the original CD at 4:39 long.  This mellow love song peaked at #19 on the charts in 1988.  With the improvement over the first song, this song promised that this CD held even better songs.<br /><br />Elton and his band get bombastic on \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters (Part Two).\\"  The original song was a mellow and harmonious creation on \\"Honky Chateau.\\"  This version is funky and bouncy, and far from being mellow.  While I am tempted to compare this song with some of the worst from \\"Leather Jackets,\\" the comparison would be wrong.  This song has fun with the overblown style, and keeps the enthusiasm evinced from the first song.  This song also makes an excellent stylistic introduction to the next song.<br /><br />The next song is the best indication that Elton had created a very listenable album.  \\"I Don't Wanna Go on with You Like That\\" had a sharp musical production with a snappy beat that maintained the pace and power of the three previous songs.  This #2 charting song had good lyrics and even better music to make this song one of the best created by the Elton John-Bernie Taupin team in a long time, and gave fans the opportunity to rejoice that the duo still had this kind of music to give the world.<br /><br />Then comes a song that I think belongs in the portfolio of some of the best Elton John ballads.  In \\"Japanese Hands\\" Bernie Taupin finally created lyrics to match some of his best from the era that yielded \\"Madman Across the Water\\" and \\"Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player.\\"  Elton matched those words with lovely music and a singing style that was heard on Elton's \\"Live in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\\" and would be later heard on \\"Songs from the West Coast.\\"  This beautiful ballad is one of my personal favorites on this CD.<br /><br />The next song is a change of pace.  \\"Goodbye Marlon Brando\\" has a beat that is even faster than the first songs on the CD.  This song reminds me of Billy Joel, especially \\"We Didn't Start the Fire.\\"  The song is less ambitious than the Billy Joel song, confining itself to summarizing the 80s, and perhaps the 70s to a certain degree.  The song does say goodbye to a lot of things I remember from the 1980s.  This song is interesting and fast, and perhaps slightly better than the average song on this CD.<br /><br />The next three songs combined form a weak spot in this CD.  \\"The Camera Never Lies\\" is the rock version of those country songs that deal with the bad things that happen in life.  In this case the subject is infidelity.  While the music and the words are less than inspired, the song is okay and is an average song for this CD.  This CD goes from an average song to a less than average song.  \\"Heavy Traffic\\" contains a few moments of interest, but otherwise the song is one of the weaker songs on this CD and sounds more likeElton on cruise control.  The following song lyrically seems intended to be sympathetic to women who get stuck with too many children and a loser husband, but \\"Poor Cow\\" never fulfills the promise of the lyrics, and is another that is much less than average.<br /><br />This CD originally finished with another lovely ballad, \\"Since God Invented Girls.\\"  This song contains a tribute to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.  The backing vocals enhance the feeling of the tribute by adopting the harmonious style of the Beach Boys.  This song joins \\"Japanese Hands\\" as being another of my favorite songs on this CD.<br /><br />In addition to the original ten songs, this version contains four bonus tracks that add little to the original production, but do give a listener a bit more bang for the musical buck.<br /><br />This album starts with a promising title.  This CD was not quite the \\"strike back\\" that the title promised.  However, there are enough good songs on this CD to make this CD a good improvement over the previous original album, and fans a few years later would recognize that this album marked a turn for the better for Elton John and Bernie Taupin, now going by the single name Taupin.  In a few short years Elton John would receive more awards and nominations than he had received in his career to this point, and while the future Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member may have fallen short in striking back with this CD, perhaps this CD was just the beginning of a strike that is pushing its way into two decades.unds more like Elton on cruise control.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is Linkin Park's sophomore album and the follow-up to the multi-platinum album Hybrid Theory.  And like Hybrid Theory, any Linkin Park fan owes it to themselves to pick up this album.  If you enjoyed Hybrid Theory, chances are you will enjoy Meteora as well.    The one thing that stands out about the CD is that is sounds a lot different than Hybrid Theory.  Meteora is the evolution of Linkin Park.  They've put together an album that sets itself apart from Hybrid Theory, instead of just being a tad bit better but sounding the same.  A lot of themes appear throughout the album, such as acoustic samples and even some piano and violin.  But don't worry: the album still rocks above everything else.    Here's a rundown of the songs:    Foreword - nifty little intro that goes right into the first song.  Can't really rate it, since it's not a song lol    Don't Stay - This song could be described as an evolution of One Step Closer.  A really hard-hitting rock song from start to finish, with some nice scratching from Mr. Hahn. (5 out of 5)    Somewhere I Belong - Meteora's top single and one of my favorites off the album.  A very different sounding song than what LP's done in the past, probably due to the acoustic sampling.  Some classic lyrics from both Mike and Chester. (5 out of 5)    Lying From You - This song begins with some nifty violin sampling.  A really heavy song with some catchy lyrics. (5 out of 5)    Hit The Floor - Another one of those songs that sounds really different from Hybrid Theory, but in a good way.  Not a favorite but it's a pretty tight song though. (4 out of 5)    Easier To Run - Kinda like Hit The Floor, it's not a favorite but not a bad song either.  Very thoughtful lyrics in this one. (4 out of 5)    Faint - This song rocks.  Very fast-paced song with catchy violin sampling and killer guitar.  Definitely one of my favorites. (5 out of 5)    Figure.09 - Another hard-hitting rock song, with excellent rapping from Mike.  Nice DJ work too. (5out of 5)    Breaking The Habit - This song is a very unique song, mainly due to the violin players in the background.  Very soothing song with light guitar combined with some DJ mixing from Mr. Hahn.  Great singing from Chester. (5 out of 5)    From The Inside - Kinda similar to Somewhere I Belong.  One of my favorites.  Both Chester and Mike are awesome on this song. (5 out of 5)    Nobody's Listening - This track shares a lot of similarities to High Voltage off Hybrid theory (special edition) in the fact that it's pretty much a straight-up hip hop track.  I love the Japanese flute sample, it makes this song stand out a lot.  Great rhymes from Mike, accompanied by Chester singing in the refrain. (5 out of 5)    Session - Some people will recognize this track from The Matrix Reloaded soundtrack.  Like Cure For The Itch on Hybrid Theory, Session is an instrumental track with no words.  Put together mainly by Mike with some added touches from the rest of the band.  No words, but it's a pretty tight track. (5 out of 5)    Numb - Probably my favorite song off Meteora.  Great piano from Mike, and some soulful singing from Chester. (It's the Soulful Chaz!)  This song rocks, pure and simple. (5 out of 5)    Like I said about Hybrid Theory, this is one of those CDs that all Linkin Park fans should have in their collection.  If you don't have it, get it!  You'll treasure it forever.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I have loved the Eagles for many, many years.  The Hell Freezes Over concert was one of the highlights of my life.  I saw it at San Francisco and it was truly amazing.  This DVD is even better.  It amazes me that the years do not somehow diminish the quality of the Eagles music.  On the contrary, they get better and I enjoy them more.  This one even has my favorite, Take it to the Limit, which was not on the Hell Freezes Over concert agenda.  Thank you, Eagles, for the pleasure of your music!  I look forward to the next time!
B000002H2H|5.0|I say this as I finish watching their documentary \\"Some Kind of Monster\\". And I think, judging by the place the band is in today, it would be hard to see them reaching the creative heights attained in this album. There is just so much internal politics and contention going on inside the band that I believe they should've broken up long before st. anger was released. But I guess it's all about the money now and they would have to be fricking stupid to break up something that generates so much revenue from hardcore fans (myself included). Anyway, Ride the Lightning is without a doubt my personal favorite not only because it was the first metallica record I've ever owned but because repeat listenings make the songs more complex than they really seem. Yeah, this album deals with situations of death and decay but words are merely the tip of the iceberg. There are actually layers to the songs that one will notice only after they take root in your head. From the thunderous (how suiting) riffs to the pounding drum beats, I swear this album is anything but mundane. The first song that comes to mind would be \\"for whom the bell tolls\\". Just terrific on all four fronts, an instance where everything really came together. This is what you get when you have all four guys on the same page. But now, as the war of egos crash down on James and Lars, Metallica would be hardpressed to go back to the very foundations that made them famous in the first place. I would say that it is the discord, the strife, the damn politics that is making the band deteriorate into ordinary rockers, a label that would be okay if you were a band like um, say, linkin park but is not okay if you are metallica. I may be quoting Alice on this but I say the band's down in a hole. And it looks like they're going to need more than just a shovel to dig themselves out. They need four.
B00003CXXO|4.0|This movie is pleasant to watch. It is different from the other american sci-fi movies, which have a lot of horror mixed in them. \\"A.I.\\" didn't horrify me (unlike \\"Event Horizon\\", for example, which is a mixture of sci-fi and horror). The main character (David) is a polite, although weird, robotic child. He is cute, but his laughter is sudden and strange and frightening.<br /><br />The story begins in the house of the family which bought David. The problem is that David does some things that are potentially dangerous (comes at midnight to his mother's bed with a scissor in hand; almost drowns a real child). That is why he is abandoned by the mother, in a dark forest. And he almost gets destroyed in a Flesh Fair. It is a show where robotic humanoids are being destroyed, for the enjoyment of the people. If you have seen \\"The running man\\" with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Flesh Fair is very similar. There he meets Gigolo Joe - a robotic lover, whose character may be appealing to adults.<br />The end of the movie is pessimistic, as it is just another apocalyptic prediction that life on earth will cease to exist in the future. The end is not about intelligence at all, but rather it feels like a fairytale about a child that lost his mommie.<br /><br />I liked the special effects - the images of semi-human, semi-robotic faces are dazzling. But the movie's storyline didn't seem too deep for me. Perhaps the movie is more intriguing for small children.  Here are some memorable lines from the movie: \\"Keep me safe\\", \\"I am special, I am unique, I am David!\\", \\"Please make me a real boy\\". It is sad, that the idea of a female robotic girl is not developed - only some boxes with a shadow of a girl and the name \\"Darlene\\" are briefly visible. I wish the \\"mecha\\" (mechanical) people were shown as something more than weird, clanky pieces of metal junk.<br />Overall, this movie is more about family sentiments and emotions, rather than \\"intelligence\\".
B00004Z459|5.0|When I was growing up, I mostly listened to hip hop music and never really gave rock a try. When I first heard of Linkin Park, I didn't really like them that much. I was like most people that I know today that still don't like Linkin Park. At the place where I used to work, one of my co-workers called them a \\"boy band with guitars.\\" And admittedly, that's what I had originally percieved Linkin Park as. Mainly because I heard songs like \\"Crawling\\" and \\"In The End\\" and thought of them as songs \\"more geared towards teen girls.\\"  <br /> <br />After a while, I started getting into a few bands like Limp Bizkit. But after listening to constant yelling about a girl that Fred Durst got screwed over by (which happened like years ago) and songs that had little to no meaning whatsoever (Rollin') I had a desire to seek out a rock band that not only satisfied my hip hop needs, but also brought in some emotion and feeling to their music.  <br /> <br />Then, my friend came over to my house with Hybrid Theory in his hands. At first I didn't really care, but then he started playing the CD and all of a sudden, something very unexpected happened. I started liking Linkin Park! I tried to pretend like I didn't like the music, but that CD was everything that I had been looking for the past few years. Not only did it have a good deal of rap in it, but the lyrics were filled with feeling and emotion. I started to realize that songs like \\"Crawling\\" weren't just written for teenie bopper girls suffering from depression. A lot of the emotions and feelings of that song, among other songs on the album, described the feelings that I had inside of myself.  <br /> <br />Then one day, I came across an import of Hybrid Theory at the local music store. It included two bonus tracks not found on the CD that my friend had. It costed a lot, but there weren't any regular versions of the CD so I figured, might as well get it so I can have something to wave in my friend's face. After getting home, I listenedto the entire CD and was extremely surprised by how awesome it was. Here's my thoughts on all the tracks:  <br /> <br />Papercut - The first song on the CD, it gives a good impression of what to expect from the rest of the CD. Some hard-hitting guitar combined with some great rhymes from Mike. (5 out of 5)  <br /> <br />One Step Closer - The one song that I liked even when I didn't like Linkin Park, and one of my favorites to this day. Great singing and screaming from Chester. A classic. (5 out of 5)  <br /> <br />With You - A great example of Mr. Hahn's mad DJ skills, combined with killer lyrics from both Mike and Chester. The great mix of scratching and guitar is especially awesome on this track. (5 out of 5)  <br /> <br />Points Of Authority - Another classic heavy rock song. Nice lyrics, especially from Chester. I love the cool effects at the end of the song. (5 out of 5)  <br /> <br />Crawling - The classics keep on coming. Didn't really like it back when I first heard it, but now it's one of my faves. Really deep lyrics in this song. (5 out of 5)  <br /> <br />Runaway - Another song with some nice DJ work combined with more hard guitar and nice lyrics from Chester. (5 out of 5)  <br /> <br />By Myself - Not exactly one of my favorite LP songs, but it does feature some great lyrics from Mike. (4 out of 5)  <br /> <br />In The End - Yet another classic song. Really thoughtful rapping from Mike who busts out with some classic rhymes. Chester really pours out on this song too. (5 out of 5)  <br /> <br />A Place For My Head - Great rap lyrics from Mike on this song. A little more complex guitar than in some of the other songs. Great song to rock out to. (5 out of 5)  <br /> <br />Forgotten - Another one of those songs that's okay but not exactly a favorite. It's still good though. (4 out of 5)  <br /> <br />Cure For The Itch - The one stand-out song on the album. A DJ track by Mr. Hahn, and one of my favorite tracks on the album. Some rock fans might not like it,but if you like scratching this track is tight. (5 out of 5)  <br /> <br />Pushing Me Away - The CD finishes off with this song, with more great lyrics and guitar. A great song to close the album with. (5 out of 5)  <br /> <br />For those who have either the special edition CD or the Japanese import, there's two bonus tracks included. These do not appear on the regular version of the CD.  <br /> <br />My December - The whole song is pretty much piano, with no rock whatsoever. Probably why it didn't make the original CD. It's an okay song, but not exactly on the top of my favorite LP song list. (3 out of 5)  <br /> <br />High Voltage - A new version of an old song from the Hybrid Theory EP CD. Some of Mike's best lyrics is on this song, although unfortunately it's censored (the S word, which he only says twice). But still an awesome hip hop song. (5 out of 5)  <br /> <br />So anyway, you can get either the regular version of Hybrid Theory or the one with the two extra songs (the special edition also comes with some live songs too, but I haven't heard them so I didn't rate them). I recommend the one with the bonus tracks though, they're pretty tight. And it probably won't cost you too much more.  <br /> <br />So to end my review, if you're a fan of Linkin Park chances are you already own Hybrid Theory. If you don't, then you should hit yourself in the head a bunch of times. Then get this CD.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend people to give this CD a try. You might just like it. Don't let that \\"boy band with guitars\\" stuff get in your head, because if you give them a chance you'll see that their music is geared towards all kinds of people, not just girls. It's a blend of all kinds of musical styles, so even people who don't like rock music can probably get into it. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
0778320448|4.0|This book tells the stories of four women with one knitting class in common.  Each character is very different and superbly developed.  The rotating style of the book gives each character a short chapter which continues throughout.  This adds greatly to keeping order of the characters and those around them and  avoids leaving the reader confused with all the various people.  Having knowledge of knitting causes one to smile every so often but is certainly not requisite to read this book.  This is an excellent vacation book and very relaxing to read.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Due to working at a video store, and being interuppted by customers, I had to watch this one twice.  Content was excellent, and it was one of those that you just have to find out what happens!! Robin Williams was great in the movie as well. One of the best dark and sinister characters he has played!!  Al Pacino does a great job with the material!! Fun, edge of your seat entertainment!!!
B000002J03|5.0|This is my absolute favorite Led Zeppelin album.  Led Zeppelin has such a diverse sound, I don't know how you could not like them!  Led spans several genres of music such as blues, proto-punk, early metal, fusion, hardrock, psychedelia, English folk, even some carribean-sounding songs, hell these guys are just plan old rock!  You should definitey pick this one up if you're a rock fan.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Halle berry stars in this good horror movie in which Halle Berry plays a doctor (psychiatrist) at a mental institution but her life still seems to be fine. She has a nice husband and life is great until she wrecks her car to avoid hitting a naked lady in the street. When she wakes up, she's in the mental institution for murdering her husband which she doesn't remember doing. But, believe me, there's more to it and obviously something else is happening behind this. I won't say anything else because I don't want to give away what else happens or the highly unpredictable ending that no one will guess. Halle Berry gorgeous and she also can act as she does actually a very nice job. Horror movies like this are hard to find lately. Watch it and be surprised at how good it is and what a surprising ending you'll be in for.
B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones.If Judy wasn't a punk then where would they be now?(And why the hell shouldn't Judy be a punk?) I get a lot of criticism because i am a 12 year old punk, but this album does us proud. Pure rock & roll. Has anyone who hates punks actually listened to decent rock (and not the fakers the Darkness?)No? I rest my case.
B0009YKWAK|3.0|Nicole Kidman (Dogville, The Hours, To Die For) plays Sylvia Broome, an Interpreter for the U.N. who over heard something up in the booth that she works in that may have been an assassination on the president of Matobo, Zubwanie. So, secret service agent Tobin Keller, played by Sean Penn (Mystic River, The Assassination Of Richard Nixon), whos wife just recently died, is on the verge of believing her and not. Nicely constructed action/thriller with some pretty good moments, one being a bus conversation and then it explodes. Also starring Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich, Full Frontal), Jesper Christopher and Michael Wright (Money Talks, Pinero). Probably one of the only good movies that has come out so far besides Sin City and Constantine. A fun ride. <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I must say...what type of sad world do we live in where someone can simply post a 1-star review of Napoleon Dynamite, say nothing more than \\"This is the worst movie ever! It wasn't funny at all!\\", and get a \\"4 out of 12 people found the following review helpful\\"? Has our intelligence and patience really sunk THIS low?! Come on! I know this movie isn't for everybody, and has a style of humor that 1/4th of the people who see it won't get, but seriously! People who post reviews like that are the main reason why this movie shouldn't have become popular. Back when this was still a semi-obscure indie movie, everyone who went out of their way to see it loved it, but now that it's popular, the average mainstream moviegoer/MTV whore is just going to think this movie is \\"weird\\" and \\"pointless\\" (If you need proof: Notice that 90% of the negative reviews were posted after the movie skyrocketed in popularity). If you've seen this movie multiple times, have tried to \\"get it\\", and failed, then that's okay. But if you're just a mindless basher who knows nothing about deadpan/oddball humor...then I'm sorry. I can't respect that at all.<br /><br />That being said, Napoleon Dynamite was one of the best movies of 2004, besides Collateral and Kill Bill: Vol. 2. At a time where Hollywood has sunk to an all-time low with their endless inferior remakes of classic films (Flight Of The Phoenix, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and nonstop streams of comic-book movies (The Punisher, The Hulk), this delightful indie movie was a gigantic breath of fresh air (and a gigantic slap in the face to Tinseltown's big budget sets and plastic actors). I remember seeing this movie in theatres in July 2004 (before it became really popular) with my equally geeky friends, and accidently spilling my coffee all over the floor from laughing so hard.<br /><br />Set in the semi-rural town of Preston, Idaho, Napoleon Dynamite is the story of a ranting, nerdy teenager who's simply trying to deal with his crazy life, both at school and at home. His 32-year old brother Kip is obsessed with chatrooms and his internet-girlfriend (as well as \\"becoming a cage fighter\\"), his grandma loves riding dune buggies, everyone at school doesn't know what to make of his bizzare set of interests (martial arts, computer hacking, U.F.O.'s, \\"Nessie\\"), and to top it all off, there's a new kid at school named Pedro who just moved there from Tijuana! Luckily, Pedro's friendship may be all Napoleon needs to help turn his life around.<br /><br />The end result is 89 minutes of quirky, off the wall humor that you could previously only find in Election or Rushmore. The film turns into a showcase for rookie talent, as Jon Heder & Aaron Ruell are great as the nerdy Dynamite brothers, and first time writer/director Jared Hess gives the movie a deliciously lo-fi feel.<br /><br />The dialogue alone is something to be marveled at. Like one of my friends said: The \\"memorable quotes\\" (...)to have the entire script of this movie. Much like in \\"Office Space\\", pretty much every line is up for grabs, from \\"Go make yourself a dang quesadilla\\" to \\"You guys are retarted!\\" to \\"Your mom goes to college!\\". If you're in high school, you've probably heard (or been bombarded with) these quotes for the last few months, so why not take the time to see the movie that spanwed them?<br /><br />The only real flaw I see with the movie is that even with the added epilogue, and the deleted scenes...it's just too friggin' short. But what counts is that it's a great ride while it lasts...and it feels far fresher than any other movie I saw last year.<br /><br />****½/*****d at home.

B00005V9HH|5.0|I was rather frustrated with the large number of F words in this movie, as I don't understand why this word is used even once. But, I having already watched Pulp Fiction and Scarface, do know that it could've been worse. On the other hand, I am obligated to give this movie 5 stars because of the excellent but somewhat confusing plot (at least the first time you watch it), the unpredicatable ending, the great shootouts, the neat humor, and the mystery of Keiser Soze. This movie will definitely be a lot better to understand the more times you see it. If you rewatch it, you can tell many things that you hadn't beforehand. Well, anyway, now for the plot. The movie opens with Gabriel Bryn's character getting shot, and the boat he's on gets set to fire. But then, we go back in time with these 5 criminals played by Gabriel Bryne, Stephen Baldwin, the comic but very hard to understand Benicio Del Torro, the marvelous Kevin Pollack, and of course Kevin Spacey whose character is crippled. These criminals are interviewed in prison but never get convicted. You watch them as they hold up cars and so forth. And then comes the scene where the messenger of someone who's either a myth or real called Keiser Soze who arrives. This man tells them that Mr. Soze wants them to hijack a boat and retrieve the cocaine on it. The criminals refuse but he informs them that Mr. Soze knows all of their criminal records. When they try to take this messenger out later, he says that Mr. Soze will kill their love ones if they refuse. You then find out that Soze (which you always don't know if he exists or not) is a madman who killed his own wife and children and killed many other men , women and children. The group of criminals have to now kill many bodyguards and cuban men to retrieve this cocaine. What happens next is amazing and very unpredictable. I won't give away anything else but, besides the bad words, you're in for a treat.
B0009ZHJ7S|3.0|another fun animate film about a young robot named Rodney Copperbottom, voiced by Ewan McGregor (StarWars3:Revenge Of The Sith, Brassed Off), who goes to Robot City to become an inventor and meet his idol, a robot voiced by Mel Brooks (SpaceBalls, High Anxiety) but an villainous evil robot, voiced by Greg Kinnear (Dear God, Auto Focus) wants to over power Brooks' robot and all the broken robots and take over the city. Rodney finds new friends in the city, including a hilarious robot named Fender, voiced by the one and only Robin Williams who can do just about any animated voice over and Rodney also starts to fix all the broken robots making Kinnear's baddie robot ticked off. Some very cool moments and some very funny moments, one highlight being where Fender and Rodney are having a armpit fight. Fun for the whole family, some jokes might go over the kids heads but the adults will get them and the kids will enjoy all the animated galore. Also roviding voices are Halle Berry (Monsters Ball, Die Another Day), Drew Carey (Tv's The Drew Carey Show), Amanda Bynes, Stanley Tucci (Shall We Dance?,Big Trouble) and Paul Giamatti (Cinderella Man, Sideways). Not the best animated movie but certainly not the worst <br />

B000002U82|5.0|Ok, there are a 1000 reviews here, but Pink Floyd is one of my favorite groups, but I am not a traditional Floyd fan either... I like many others find this to be one of the greatest albums ever, and surely Pink Floyd's finest, but it wasn't always this way.<br /><br />For me, this album was a challenge to appreciate, but well worth the effort. Being rather young, my first real introduction to Floyd was through the Division Bell... i.e. without Roger Waters... I was in high school at the time in an area where country and pop dominated the airwaves too. I didn't have the patience for music where the sum was greater than the parts, where the album was better than the song. It also didn't help that the song Money (the one real \\"hit\\" from the album) didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />Darkside didn't appeal to me because I couldn't get into it. I liked other Floyd Hits and songs, but this album didn't touch me. But then something happened... I began to appreciate classical music and the symphony or multimovement form, and it hit me. Dark Side of the moon is basically Pink Floyd's symphony. Sure it isn't a true symphony, but the album is the work, and the songs are only the parts.<br /><br />Speak to Me/Breathe/ and On the Run form the first movement and sets the tempo for the album.Time/Great Gig in the Sky form the excellent 2nd movement. Money fits the third movement dance form of a symphony. and I feel Us and Them/Any Colour You Like/Brain Damge/ and Eclipse form the 4th climactic movement.<br /><br />Oddly, as a fan of closing movements, I love that last grouping. It is the strength of the album and flows as one piece. I can never listen to any of those as individual songs. The same goes for the \\"1st and 2nd movements\\" which have to be listened to together. But the odd thing is I have never been a fan of 3rd movements, and here it isn't different. I still don't like Money much, but I appreciate where it fits in, and Dark Side wouldn't be complete without it.<br /><br />So, if you haven't done it yet, get Dark Side of the Moon and challenge yourself. If you have it, look at it in a new light. It is excellent. But if you find yourself not liking it or unsure, Wish You Were Here and The Wall may be better starting points./> <br />So, if you haven't done it yet, get Dark Side of the Moon and challenge yourself.

B00097A5I6|5.0|After three long years off, Oasis come back with a stellar album: \\"Don't Believe The Truth.\\" This CD is a very interesting album.  With  writing contributions from all four main Oasis band members (drummer Zak Starkey, son of Ringo Starr drums on the album and their current tour but is not officially in the group) this CD may be the truest \\"Oasis\\" (not just Noel Gallagher and bandmates album) to date.   <br /> <br />Let me start off by saying that I believe CD is nothing like anything Oasis have ever released.  I don't mean that in an innovative or bad way, what I'm saying is that musically, this CD is different from their prior albums.  Since their third CD release, \\"Be Here Now,\\"  Oasis' music has been more low key and tuned down.  That is not to say they don't still rock harder than any band on the planet, it just means that they don't have as raw or \\"in your face\\" a sound as they did on DM, WTSMG, or BHN.  Still, I enjoy this CD more than SOTSOF and HC, because even with the less raw and energetic sound, it sounds like old, back to the roots Oasis to me.  This album flat out rocks.  Sometimes in an acoustic way, but it rocks. <br /> <br />A true critic will tell you that this album sounds like Pink Floyd, the Beatles, and even Bob Dylan (listen to Mucky Fingers and you'll see what I mean) but the truth is that this album sounds like Oasis.  Liam's voice is killer.  It has a grating noise that just blends perfectly with the band behind him.  The guitar playing of Noel is as ferocious and powerful as ever, and Gem, Andy, and Zak's rhythm is awesome.  If you are an old Oasis fan who did not like the last few releases, pick this one up.  Especially if you'll be seeing them live any time soon.  It is a fun CD.  If you are a new Oasis fan, I think you'll like it as well.  My mother never understood my infatuation with this band until she bought this CD a few weeks ago and now she says she finds herself listening to it quite often when she's driving around.  If you'vealways loved Oasis, you already own this CD, and you know it's awesome.  So sweet!  Bottom line, this CD is great.

B000002HFU|5.0|When someone drops the name Ol' Dirty Bastard, people usually write him off for one of two reasons: his personal life or just his stage name in general. Well folks, I can only categorize such sentiments as PURE IGNORANCE.   <br /> <br />The fact of the matter is in '95, ODB dropped one hell of a classic. <br /> <br /> <br />Not only does this album sport some of the most memorable cover art in rap, but its a great CD to boot. I will admit some of the tracks fall a little short (\\"Hippa to the Hoppa\\") but when sandwiched in between tracks like \\"Brooklyn Zoo\\" and \\"Cuttin Headz\\", we as the listener become extrememly forgiving. <br /> <br /> <br />So to those who look at Ol Dirty's grimy facade and scoff (*cough cough*....white people), I implore you give this CD a chance. You may be in for a surprise.
B00006F7S4|5.0|\\"Put your hands on the wheel... let the golden age begin\\".  These are the opening lines of this album, lines which now send chills up my spine, followed by a wave of content and relaxation.  \\"These days I barely get by... I don't even try.\\"  Touche my friend.    Sea Change is hands-down, without a doubt an instant classic, and sure to stand the test of time as one of the all-time great mellow rock albums.  It's one of those rare gems that really digs down, hits the spot, and becomes a part of you.  With this album, Beck throws the hammer down on those who doubted that he is one, if not THE quinnessencial songwriter of this generation.  No more joking around, he says.  This is who I am and how I feel.  You can feel his pain from the lyrics more than if he was actully stabbing you with his pen.  And it couldn't be any more real.  I really don't mean to sound elitist or condecending, but if you can honestly listen to this album start to finish, and not feel moved in the slightest bit, then I must say I feel very sorry for you.  This is as emotional and heartfelt as it gets, and I think its safe to say that most human beings, especially in our present social climate, can identify with the issues and feelings Mr. Hanson is poring out for us.      As for the actual sound of the music, think Pink Moon meets Kid A, add a dash of After the Goldrush and Blood on the Tracks.  If thats not enough to make you buy this album right now, I don't know what is.  Me, I'm just happy I've found it.  Now I just have to figure out how to make myself turn it off.    (Oh, and by the way Beck, I love what you've done with Nick Drake's 'Know'.  See ya round the bend.)
B0000524CY|5.0|Simply put, the scariest movie ever filmed. People talk about the \\"dated\\" effects, and the \\"impossible\\" story, but it's the unexplained that really can grab you.<br />Personally, I prefer the \\"on location\\" effects, live in front of the camera. Digital effects can be nice, but they are missing something. Those effects happened in front of the camera as you see them.<br />(spoiler)<br />Probably the most frightening scene in the whole movie, involved very little in the way of special effects; I'm talking about the scene where the two doctors came to the house, and the girl is having a seizure in her bedroom. That just freaks me out, it's the most horrifying thing to see - someone with no control of their body, the thrashing and flailing, and the screams for help. That is 100% believable; someone in my family went into diabetic shock in front of me once, and it scared me to death. The similarities were uncanny. This film blends the credible with the incredible, and , this many years later, it is STILL the most terrifying film ever made, along with the original \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\\"<br />Watch it. Experience it.
B00002E23E|5.0|Led Zepellin is possibly inch by inch, the most complete, authentic and original rock band in the last sixties and seventies. From the riffs of Jimmy Page, to Bonham's drums. This concert on Madison Garden is not only a historical document but a timeless proof for the new generations who will born about the stature and presence of this heavy band. The ensemble, the original arrangements, the language and score of every one of his pieces will engage. I love from that age Moby Dick in which Bonham will give us a true tour de force, Lemon Song for instance, that was not played. I didn't like Whole lotta ` love , and to my mind Stairway to heaven, Rock& Roll and Moby Dick were the jewels of the crown.<br /><br />An unforgettable spectacle all the way.
B000244EMO|5.0|What made Predator unique for its time was that this was first movie in a long while with and *intelligent*, sentient monster. Add to that the fact that the monster was 100's of years more technologically advanced than humans, and you have a incredibly engrossing story. Imagine, an alien species that views US as animals, no different than we would view a tiger or lion. And I thought the acting was well done from all of the crew, Arnold, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Carl Weathers, etc. Definitely one for the permanent collection.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Phantom of the Opera is a amazing musical to watch again and again!!!!! I have never seen the broadway production of this musical,but it was just as good watching on broadway!!!!! The setting, costumes, the phantom were all wonderful to watch!!!!!! I have to say that i'm a huge fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber and i would have to say that Phantom is my all time favorite!!!!!! It is a touching story,but it is also a charming romantic story too and it shows you that you can't be in love with two guys either!!!!! Go out and rent this musical and watch the amazing broadway production of Phantom of the Opera!!!!!!!
0743454529|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Having read several news articles regarding parents who had children for the express purpose of providing matching organs or bone marrow for a sibling, I never took into consideration what this may mean to the \\"donor\\".  This fast reading account of a family dealing with a dying child and the only sibling who can save her, is well written and food for much thought.  I highly recommend this book.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|This movie is a poweful true story and if you like sports it was a well sports movie too!!!!! I would rate this movie a 10 instead of a five,because of what values it deals with in every day society!!!!!! It shows you that you should go to school and try to get your education instead of wasting time ditching school!!!!! Samuel L. Jackson was truly a wonderful actor to play Ken Carter which turn these boys lifes around forever!!!!! My friend said to me you really need to watch this movie and i didn't want to waste my time at first,but i'm glad that i got to see this movie and if you have not seen it yet you should watch this movie and parents you should have your kids watch this movie too!!!!!!
B00003CWPL|1.0|HOW DAVID LYNCH GOT BACKING FOR BLUE VELVET ET. AL. AFTER THIS MOVIE IS BEYOND ME. <br /> <br />LISTENING TO ALL THE CRITICS WHO APPLAUD THIS PIECE OF JUNK I WENT TO SEE IT AT A MIDNIGHT SHOW ABOUT 25 YEARS AGO.  I FELL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE IT WAS SO BORING! <br /> <br />THINKING IT MUST ME ME, I'VE ACTUALLY GONE BACK TWO MORE TIMES OVER THE YEARS TO TRY AND WATCH THIS FLICK AND UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THE CRITICS SEE IN IT.  I SWEAR TO YOU, I FELL ASLEEP EVERY TIME.  THE MOVIE IS SIMPLY A BAD TRAIN WRECK. <br /> <br />IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY-BAD LIKE ED WOOD.  IT'S JUST PLAIN BAD. <br /> <br />SO THEN I BOUHT IT ON LASER WHEN IT CAME OUT.  I MUST BE A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT.  AFTER 20 YEARS I FINALLY SAW THE COMPLETE MOVIE ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO.  IT'S NOT WORTH THE TIME OR EFFORT. <br /> <br />IT'S SUCH A BAD MOVIE YOU WILL LIKE ME WIND UP WONDERING HOW LYNCH WENT ON TO DO HIS OTHER GREAT FLICKS
B00005JNJT|5.0|Bruce Wayne (Bale) is a man troubled by the deaths of his parents at the hands of a local thug.  He blames himself, and has been travelling the world, picking fights.  The movie opens with Bruce being rescued from prison by Henri Ducard (Neeson).  Ducard aims to train Bruce in the art of fighting and have him join the League of Shadows, an organization presided over by the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul (Watanabe).  They are dedicated to restoring balance to a world overrun by criminals. <br /> <br />Bruce trains incredibly hard, but declines the offer to join the League.  He returns to Gothan City with the desire to ride the city of crime.  With the help of his faithful butler Alfred (Caine) and inventor Lucius Fox (Freeman), Bruce develops an alter-ego that will help him install fear into the criminals of the city.  The two biggest are crime lord Carmine Falcone (Wilkinson) and The Scarecrow (Murphy), a twisted psychiatrist who works for a mysterious employer. <br /> <br />The establishment of Batman is fully fleshed out, in this excellent film from director Christopher Nolan.  Almost no stone goes unturned as we learn how and why Batman does what he does.  Nolan has yet to make even an average movie, and was a great choice to re-boot the franchise.  And re-boot it he does.  The previous four films are ignored and a fresh look at the superhero is given. <br /> <br />Bale is perhaps the best Batman, pulling off both Bruce and Batman convincingly.  His anger, pain, and determination are very real.  Neeson is excellent in the role of teacher, perhaps channelling his inner Qui-Gon.  Caine brings dignity and compassion to Alfred the butler.  Murphy is absolutely perfect as the crazed Scarecrow (a villian I knew nothing about).  The film is dark, gritty, and violent; just as it should be.  There are even some scary moments.  And of course, the ending sets up another film.  Nolan has said that he envisions a trilogy, and I for one hope that he stays with the franchise for a while. <br /> <br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is one of the best superhero movies ever made.  It is also one of the best movies I have seen in a while.  I highly recommend this film.  See it at once!
034547581X|4.0|In WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG, the team of Harold Moore and Joey Galloway, have given us a devastating and detailed account of battle <br />   In November 1965, 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, were helicoptered into the Ia Drang valley to destroy whatever elements of the NVA they found. <br />   From the time they landed until two days later, they came under constant attack.  Colonel Moore formed a perimeter and fought a classic defensive battle, but it was a close run thing.  They were probably saved by air and artillery coverage; even so, there are grim scenes of Americans being killed by misplaced napalm and artillery rounds. <br />   The authors have no qualms about recounting the explicit gore of battle.  One soldier tried to move another and \\"it seemed like his entire brain fell out...\\"  And a few lines further, \\"Rodriguez is hit...His guts are on the ground.\\"  Everywhere, the screams and curses of dying men, and once, \\"Oh my God, forgive me.\\" <br />   One of the righteous complaints of the American soldier was that he was sent into combat with a toy for a main battle rifle, and Moore/Galloway present us with innumerable examples:  \\"I got my hands on one that didn't work.  The second one didn't either, nor the third.\\"  And \\"I fired a burst from my M-16 which promptly fell apart.\\"  One man...\\"got another man's M-16 and tried to fire it but it was inoperable.  I took his .45 pistol...\\" and Old Ugly came through for him.  The propensity of the M-16 to jam was notorious and \\"every third man was down in the bottom of the hole with a cleaning rod, cleaning the rifles.\\"  One sergeant sighted on an NVA:  \\"He fired at me and I fired back.  I got off one round and my M-16 jammed.\\" <br />   If the M-16 was a dirty joke, so was its puny 5.56mm cartridge.  \\"I got him with my first round, saw him drop...and start to crawl forward...I sighted very carefully and saw him jolted by my second round, but he kept coming...\\"  Another soldier:  I fired twice.  Ihit him but he refused to go down, he kept coming and shooting.\\"  Many soldiers bought civilian ammunition at their own expense. <br />   Moore's battalion was successful in its defense, and was relieved by Robert McDade's 2nd Battalion.  They in turn were marched out to another area (Albany) because the B-52s wanted to bomb around Moore's old area. <br />   On arrival at Albany 2nd Battalion found a gourmet Army meal waiting for them:  hamburgers, mashed potatoes, and string beans.  Under combat conditions, a meal for the gods. <br />   Unfortunately, on the fifteen mile march, 2nd Battalion had become strung out along the trail, and had entered an area occupied by some two and a half fresh NVA battalions.  They knew McDade was coming and set their ambush. <br />   While the lead elements were still eating their hamburgers, the NVA followed the old Sun-Tzu/Mao dictum \\"When possible, attack the enemy while he is in motion.\\"  They attacked the column, fractured it, surround the invidual companies and started to decimate the encircled elements. <br />   Here again, we are treated to page after page of desperate valor and butchery.  If there is any major flaw in the book it is probably this kind of repetition.  Also, there is such a large cast of characters that, unlike fiction, we can seldom identify with them.  After a time the butchery becomes commonplace, and because the participants are unknown, they become only names, and numbers. <br />   Men scattered and tried to make it to other units, while NVA death squads searched for the wounded, and executed them in the tall elephant grass.  One soldier, wounded and not expecting to survive, booby-trapped his own body with a grenade, and waited.  Artillery save him, but others were not as lucky. <br />   By sunrise next day, one company of 112 men had forty-five dead and more than fifty wounded.  Only a dozen could walk.  At the end of Albany, only four trucks were needed to carry out the non-wounded, this from some four hundred men who marched in. <br />   2nd Battalion claimed a body count of 403 NVA with an estimated 150 NVA wounded.  If these figures are valid then the casualties were about equal, and Albany was a grim standoff. <br />   After the fight, in camp, the survivors were given a victory dance.  They had showered but due to some glitch, had not been given fresh clothing.  When the local laides got a whiff of the blood, sweat, and feces smell of the uniforms, most of them opted for the powder room. <br />   Ia Drang; who won?  Both sides claimed victory.  Moore's battalion inflicted losses of about 5-1 on the NVA.  When the Americans talk about Ia Drang, they talk about Moore's battle; when the Vietnamese talk about Ia Drang, they talk about the ambush of McDade's battlaion.  Perhaps the American army had some reservations about Albany too.  McDade retired as a colonel in 1975, while Moore retired as a lieutenant-general. <br />   This is a book that \\"tells it like it is.\\" <br /> <br />
B000002IKR|5.0|Why doesn't this album have 5 stars instead of 4.5? Honestly, those of you who gave this a bad rating need to actually LISTEN to the album. This album is in the league of Metallica, Slayer, and Megadeth!!!! Show some respect!! Every single track is pure hard thrash and there are NOT any fillers.  <br />      And for the person that said As I Lay Dying and Vanilla Ice are better than this band, ARE YOU SERIOUS? And don't compare Fred Durst to Testament!!  Don't review other genres that you don't like. This is Old School Thrash Metal!! Buy some tissues and stick to your emo crap. I feel no sympathy for you. Commit suicide or something because that is what your music suggests.
0783229526|5.0|This movie was a political movie. Yes, there is one drug crazed scene after another, but you have to look at the other parts of the movie that are there. It's the end of a culture, a war we never belonged in, the direction America was headed at that time. And the feelings of HST about it all and sensing that they had pushed too far.  <br />When I watched the movie for the first time, I watched it with the commentary first with Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro, and the producer. They explain alot about the movie that I think some people are missing. It takes a certain type of person to understand and enjoy this movie and Hunter S. Thompson. He is <br />(was) his own person and one of the few that was honest about the destruction of America. He will be deeply missed and one can only pray that we are blessed with another, similar to him; for no one could ever be like him. If you've seen the movie and were not really impressed, I challenge you to rent the Criterion Collection DVD and watch it with the commentaries and the extras. It will enlighten you like no drug ever could. In the words of Hunter, \\"Buy the ticket, take the ride.\\" And what a ride it is!
B0001AP158|2.0|Don't expect to hear the same rocking classics that they wrote in the 80's.  They have taken all of the classic rocking songs, slowed them down and play the melodies differently.  The DVD is good but not what I wanted.  Sorry.
1400032717|3.0|Haddon's portrayal of Christopher is well done and very authentic.  As someone who works with persons with various disabilities, I appreciate Christopher and applaud Haddon for his ability to develop the character.  Unfortunately, this excellent characterization by itself does not make the book \\"great.\\" My main criticism is the length of this \\"novel.\\" The paperback edition I bought is only 240 pages, and that is with the lines being double-spaced.  Why the story needed to be so short I have no idea.  As a consequence, the development of the story and the other characters is short-changed.  The \\"mystery\\" of the murdered dog more or less occupies the first 120 pages.  After we learn the solution to that mystery (which is something of a jaw-dropper), Haddon seemingly begins a whole new story.  The problem is that he doesn't give himself the time to do it justice.  We don't even meet the mother until near the end of the book, and then the interactions between Christopher and his mother feel too truncated to be worthwhile.  Christopher is the most interesting and intriguing when he is interacting with others.  Instead, Haddon wastes precious space with math problems and some other asides which are supposed to illuminate but don't strike me as all that unique to the mind of an autistic teen boy.  The ending itself feels rushed and comes off as being a little too neat and tidy to feel totally believable.
0316172324|3.0|<br />Don't Think..Blink, that is the premise of this book. The author, makes an attempt to explain our instincts using some extremely flimsy scientific reasoning. The examples that are provided are real life and very interesting, however when it comes to backing them up there is a serious lack in depth and research. <br /> <br />I did not find this arguments in any particular way convincing. Each chapter a reveals a real life story which is followed by some half-researched scientific explanation and in order to get the reader to believe: \\"wow,  I think like that!\\".  <br /> <br />I give this book three stars, for the fact that it does point out the obvious that would otherwise go unnoticed by us. Where the author strays is in doing his research and backing up his findings with anything solid. I felt that the book's research appeared to be flimsy even if it had been exhaustive. The writing is at a medium level and easily accessible though to weighed down with scientific names in certain sections.  <br /> <br />Over all, read the book if you are interested but make sure to pair it with something with more substance.  <br />
B00079018K|4.0|I had heard \\"Club Foot\\" and \\"L.S.F.\\", on the radio and thought they were great.  I then had a chance to see these guys live in San Diego with four other bands, and, as the openers, they were the stand out band of the night.  I bought the album, and can't stop listening to it.  While \\"Processed Beats\\" is likely to be the next single, I think \\"Running Battle\\" is one of my favorite tracks.  Definitely a throwback to the Manchester hey-days; a semi-low-fi, Stone Roses meets Happy Mondays meets The Verve, underscored with electonica and tribal/asian beats.  See 'em live if you can!
B0007DAZW8|1.0|The other day I first heard Daft Punk's song \\"Technologic\\" on BPM (XM Radio Channel 81), thought it was good, then like an idiot I went ahead and bought the CD the next day. The rest of this album sucks! There are way too many boring and repetitive loops on here. This CD is only enjoyable if you listen to the songs no more than just once...otherwise your brain will be fried. I don't like that song \\"Technologic\\" anymore...
B00005JNBQ|1.0|The one star rating is being generous. This movie is proof that Hollywood has run out of ideas and why the ticket sales at theaters is declining at a record pace. When I talk to people about how awful this movie was, they keep saying \\"well, it's geared more toward the teenage audience, they love stuff like that.\\" Well if this is the stuff these brain-less, idiotic, can't read and write or count to eleven kids these days find entertaining, say goodbye to the country you love and your fore-fathers gave thier lives to protect because we are in serious trouble...to think these are the kids who will be running this country someday, or should I say, the kids who are going to RUIN this country someday. And we wonder why this generation has no drive, no will, no pride and no responsibility when we give them garbage like this movie to be \\"entertained\\" by. I just do not understand the obsession with this movie, it is awful. Maybe I'm just getting too old, and I'm only 32. Just think what the next generation is going to find \\"entertaining\\". Parents, it's about time you take some responsibility for you kids, don't let them see crap like this movie. The next time they talk back to you or don't give you the respect you think you deserve, do drugs, drink alcohol, have unprotected \\"relations\\", show that they have no manners whatsoever, only know who George Washington is because he is on the one dollar bill or flunk out of school, thank movies and T.V. shows like this one. If you are not a teenager and have not seen this movie yet, don't waste your time. If you are a teenager and have not seen this movie yet, please, find something more productive to do with your free time, like, go to the library and learn something for God's sake. Oops, I said God, I might have offended somebody. Oh well, this movie was offensive enough. P.S. - just incase you were wondering, The National Archives did a survey to see what teenagers actually know, they asked 100 kids between the ages of 15 and 18 who George Washington was. 73 said \\"the guy on the dollar bill\\". What does that tell ya????
B00005AQE8|5.0|If this album is not a 5 tell me what is. This is definitley 2pac's best album. These songs have true lyrics not to forget the sick beats. Ambitionz az a ridah is probably one of 2pac's best. This two disc set is a great example of true rap. This is a must have. 2pac was the most influential hip hop artist and buying this album will be a great way to remember him. Get this album now. HIS BEST!!!!!!!
B000002HK4|4.0|The title says it all.  \\"A Change of Seasons\\" is a beast of a song, forever ingrained in Dream Theater's repartee as one of the best (if not THE best) Dream Theater song under the sun. <br /> <br />Get it for that reason.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Disney's first foray into full-length feature animation was unsurprisingly measured a risky move for the studio that were best known for short Mickey Mouse and Sillie Symphony cartoons. But thankfully, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was acknowledged with critical eulogize and box office achievement, prompting the studio to continue making feature-length caricatures. This is an essential chapter in movie-making history, with so many amazing features; it really does define the word `classic'. One of my much treasured Disney movies, Snow White has all the staple ingredients for archetypal animation: a great story, fantastic animation, catchy songs and amazing imagery that still impresses after nearly 70 years. A perennial favorite, it paved the way for other grand movies (Pinocchio, Bambi, Fantasia, Dumbo et all) The DVD has great 'making of' material, including never before seen archive footage.  A must-have for Disney and film fans alike.
B00082IJ08|4.0|Although I am not a big Gorillaz fan, (or hip-hop fan for that matter) I must say that this album was done extrememly well.  The beats are catchy and although the feel is a bit strange, it does a great job in standing out from any other genre of music.  The overall mix of genres is what makes this album so versatile in terms of audience.  This album is trully amazing.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This actually is a good album. For the people who gave it bad reviews, well you aren't listening close enough. Radiohead isn't the kind of music you can just kind of play in the background and like and understand. It takes a few times of actually buckling down and listening to it. A lot of people have said this...and as snobbish as they sound, they are right.  <br />The other thing is, a lot of people like to compare the four bands: Radiohead, Travis, Coldplay and Keane. Then a lot of other people like to say they have totally different sounds. But I can certainly hear the Travis in this album especially, and the Coldplay shines through too...only Coldplay is catchy-er and easier to listen to. Lastly, don't give up on this album- it's great and you'll appreciate it!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|\\"The Machinist\\" rates as one of the best psychological films I've seen.  Christian Bale's dedication to this role, and his practically flawless performance, make me disappointed he was not nominated for an Oscar for this movie.  Trevor Reznik contrasts sharply with the creepy emotionless character Bale played in \\"American Psycho,\\" showing the wide range of his acting ability.  An excellent story, superb acting, and an awesome conclusion make \\"The Machinist\\" a great complete package.

B0002S947K|5.0|Brian K hit it right on the head!! While not the amount of waterfall action, I do have to admit that after hearing this song during the closing scene of \\"Rescue Me\\" (on FX, a hidden gem of a show among the mass of crap on TV), my eyes were loaded with tears about to flow. Mega-powerful and touching, especially given the scene that was occuring. Led me to check out clips of Ray's album here on CD now (masterful marketing!), and I like what I hear. I plan on buying the CD this weekend.
B00005JLR8|4.0|This movie was just superbly done. My only complaint is that in several parts I had to put the subtitles on because they would talk so softly and their accents would be so thick I couldn't understand what was being said, but that is just a minor flaw.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is just phenomenal and impeccable. You actually get the sense that you are viewing this family's life rather than actors playing it out. Essentially, it is the story of this young Irish couple and their two daughters who move (illegally) into the slum of all slums of Manhattan in the 1980's. The purpose of their move is so the father can pursue an acting career, but most importantly, to move away from their life in Ireland where they lost their only son to a brain tumor. Though they live in the poorest conditions, the family still keeps their chins up and makes the best of their situation. Additionally, they develop a strong friendship with their strange downstairs neighbor, whom they find out latter is dying from Aids. The story is full of real-life problems and situations yet the family seems to make it in the end through hope, faith, and a few miracles.<br /><br />Truly touching and well told story.
B00004W52U|5.0|This is the benchmark for all deeply political post Clash punk. <br />Zip Zap <br />Tao <br />Zen <br />Her-Him <br />Unity  <br />What's next? <br />Anger with a purpose or just anger.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|1. this music is not up to foo fighters' standards. <br /> <br />2. this cd is copy protected, i cant listen to the music on my mp3 player.  i have to borrow my friend's horribly overpriced dualdisc version to get it on. <br /> <br />3. dont buy it because it is not even close to as good as other albums, this band is clearly in decline and i probably wont buy their next album. Save the money or buy a chili pepper's album.
B000007T1M|5.0|Their self titled album is a huge sucess. Addicting songs put their curse onto you, you can't stop listening. It's an incredible sound from an incredible band. The songs are addicting and never tend to get old. Recommended for people who give a sh*t.
B0009NSE1K|4.0|Clutch is a band you like or not.  But to all the Clutch fans out there, Robot Hive/Exodus does not disappoint.  It kinda picks up where Blast Tyrant left off.  They've added a good deal of organ and keyboards but it only adds to their musical spectrum.  The lyrics on this album are totally awesome, one of my favorite parts of a Clutch album.  Neil Fallon always thinks up the most bizarre situtations to sing about, which makes Clutch such a great musical trip.  Delware Destroyers, rocking with Dokken!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|If this album was a dick, then I'd suck it. as it is, it's just the nuts, and I'm swinging away.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|...so what's with the four stars?  Well, I happen to think that the Eagles were one of the three best American rock bands of the 70s. One of the best of all time, in fact. And this concert proves once again how timeless most of their music was and how well it has stood the test of time. (Their new album is pathetic and a blemish on their record, but the old stuff is great...)    Anyway. There are plenty of highlights on this lenghty two-disc concert recording. Tremendous renditions of songs like \\"Heartache Tonight\\", \\"New Kid In Town\\", \\"Desperado\\" and \\"One Of These Nights\\". And Don Felder's replacement, lead guitarist Steuart Smith, is magnificent.  But I don't love the arrangements. The blaring, monotonous horn section threatens to drown out everything else...most of these songs obviously weren't written with a horn section in mind, and the grotesque trumpet solos on the otherwise lovely \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" are an abomination.    There are too many slick synthesizers and 80s-style keyboards here, and it makes some of the songs sound badly dated...especially the ones from Don Henley's solo albums. And what's with that utterly bizarre violin droning away on \\"Already Gone\\"?!    Sounds pretty bad, doesn't it?  Well, it really isn't. The horns only marr the outro to \\"Hotel California\\", not the song itself, and they are completely absent on several songs, as is the violin. Don Henley is fantastic on the slowies \\"Desperado\\" and \\"Wasted Time\\", and Glenn Frey does a terrific \\"Lyin' Eyes\\". And Joe Walsh's new song, the highly personal \\"One Day At A Time\\" is a must-hear, one of the best songs of the entire set.  Walsh, the only showman of the lot, also clowns around in his most charming fashion on an enjoyable \\"Life's Been Good So Far\\", and his vocals are stronger than ever...he hits the high notes with impressive ease, sounding better than he did on 1994's \\"Hell Freezes Over\\".    The Eagles can't quite make Walsh's \\"Walk Away\\" or \\"Funk #49\\" sound convincing, but they do a great\\"Boys Of Summer\\" (the mid-80s Don Henley-single), and a lovely rendition of their newest single, the gospel-like \\"Hole In The World\\". And I can't get over how great guitarist Steuart Smith is...his guitar sounds much better and more smooth than Joe Walsh's sometimes metallic-sounding Stratocaster, and he plays every fill and every solo to perfection.    So, a lot of good here and some minor annoyances as well. The horn section should have been left at home, and solo violins don't belong in hard rock. But fans will most certainly want a look anyway, and most of this DVD is a very fine testament to the longevity of the Eagles and the immense quality of their music.
6305622930|5.0|It leaves a lump in the throat even to comment on the brilliance of this movie which will stand the test of time and be still considered 100 years from now as possibly the greatest war movie ever put on film. A big statement maybe but when one considers the brilliance of the casting in this epic everything else becomes self evident.It brought together as possibly none before or since, a great script and an even greater actor who gave the performance of his career and in the process virtually guaranteed the immortality of this film and what it stands for. It told the story of perhaps Americas greatest General who did exactly what he was expected of him namely to fight and die for his country. Patton accomplished this in spades although he never died on the battlefield he well could have numerous times such was his ability to lead from the front and never expect any soldier to do what he would not.I doubt there is another General in Americas history about whom this could be said which is testimony enough to Pattons undoubted legacy. That his country never saw fit to include its greatest General among the 5 Star immortals  was probably due to the fact that he embarrassed both Ike and Roosevelt on several occasions with poor judgement on matters of diplomacy only and certainly not connected to anything he did on the battlefield.That these men could not see beyond their own egos and recognise Patton for what he was and reward him accordingly speaks more for their own deficiencies as it does for Pattons and deprives Americans of according Patton the highest honour which he so rightly deserved. George C Scott played Patton down to his bootstraps and gave as good a performance in portraying patton as Patton himself gave on the battlefield. Quite an achievment by any yardstick.One could even forgive Scott for not accepting the Oscar such was the brilliance of his portrayal. This performance by Scott ranks high among the handful of similar type performances in movie history.One thinks of Hackmans Popeye Doyle, Douglas's Spartacus to name two. Even in this illustrious company Scotts performance must rate at the top such was the sheer believabilty of his effort. Karl Maldens portrayal of Bradley is par excellance and not far below that of Scott. But then when did Malden ever give us a below par performance. Its not in the nature of the man. Had Malden played alongside an actor of lesser talent I believe he would have stolen the credits and rightly so, how often, sadly have we seen similar pairings but that is life and Malden is considered no less of an actor as a result. One for the ages.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Honestly, I don't know what all the other reviewers are babbling on about.  I'm sure they're the kind of viewer that only watches a movie if there are more than eight car explosions in it.  The intent of the movie is to submerge you in a world of surreal experiences, as any trip to a foreign country (especially to one as complex as japan) would be.  Dialog between the characters is realistic and didn't have me feeling like some screenwriter agonized hours over trying to make it as ornate and convoluted as possible.  Truly a breath of fresh air in a medium where plots are thought only as vacant lots of dirt.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Those of you who think this album is crap: don't give up on it that easily. It takes a few spins to really come alive. When it does you will be amazed. The most accessible tracks are \\"Fix You\\" and \\"Speed of Sound.\\" The other songs may not move you until you listen to them several times, then watch out! You'll get a rush of blood to the head :) I think this is Coldplay's best album yet. Bigger brighter and packed with emotion. I've been listening to it nonstop for two weeks now and it gets better and better with each listen.
0670033375|5.0|Geography is detiny? It just might be so. This is an excellent book for anyone interested in what it's all about.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I must be missing something or else people are a bit too biased. I was really looking forward to this CD after their last one and their recent single Speed of Sound, but I have listened to it 4 times in my car and am not impressed at all. Other than the single, there are no songs that are intersting enough to want to hear over and over or (like A Rush of Blood) that bring out the emotion of it's predecessor.
B0008ENHTE|2.0|Why do people continue to watch and purchase this over-rated movie.  In asking this loaded question I will give you one more reason to watch it, one last time. <br />Top reasons to watch this movie. 1) A 1967 Dodge Charger gets destroyed,  2) Steve McQueen, 3) a car chase through the streets of San Francisco.  4) The \\"Bullit\\" Mustang.  5) The Historical value as a record of the late 60's street scenes (cars and buildings).  6) The \\"Tough Cop\\" story with violence and social issues.  7)Because you saw it as a kid.  8) because you are at a friends house and he saw it as a kid.  9) because it's the only movie you own and you can't get out of the house or turn off the DVD player.  10) because you read this review, and want to know if I am exaggerating.   <br /> <br />First off, just because a movie has a poor story and many technical problems (other than being dated and weak), is still no reason to give it a bad review.  The real issue here is whether the movie delivers what it says its selling.  You wouldn't sign a deed for a Volkswagen after dishing out for a Ferrari would you?  <br /> <br />1) A 1967 Dodge Charger gets destroyed.  The single greatest car destruction is of a Charger launching into a gas station and it is played in fast motion.  This is lame.  If you want to see it and enjoy it, you will need to use the DVD slow-mo function.  Perhaps this is why it is worth owning on DVD.  After all, most VCRs are not very steady on slow mo, especially on old tapes. <br />2) Steve McQueen.  He's cool, for many that will be \\"Nuf sed\\".  He's got a great \\"Hollywood Ugly\\" look.  Sad puppy-dog eyes and just enough cragginess and weariness to make him seem like he understands our pain.  His look was perfect for The Great Escape.  In this story he is really the only thing worth watching.  The rest are made for TV fixtures and \\"b\\" list actors.   <br />3) A car chase through the streets of San Francisco.  Yes the cars go up and down hills and around corners.  But no sense of place (other than it looks like San Francisco).  It seems like maybe they didn't spend too much on shooting permits.  \\"Lets just do this.  We can move the background cars and they can go around the same corner again.  We're banking on Steve McQueen here, not doing rocket science.\\" And to make the movie completely useless for anyone who only cares about \\"that great car chase\\", this single chase scene is so full of technical problems it is nearly impossible to enjoy.  It's the worst kind of car-porn.  All the story is fluff leading up to a single car chase that is badly shot with obvious continuity and technical problems. It's like they didn't bother watching their dailies and just tried to fixed everything in post.  They didn't worry about slight technical things like \\"the black tire marks are still on the road from the last take\\" or \\"no one will notice if a dark green car has dent in the rear corner, we'll just edit around it.\\"  The Mustang runs around (from the beginning of the movie) with a big dent in the rear passenger quarter.  However, many of the chase scenes clearly show a clean panel there, both before and after it hits the parked car that is responsible for the dent.  As they say, the devil's in the details, and yes, we do notice them, that's why we haven't seen this movie for a while.   <br />4) The \\"Bullit\\" Mustang.  Yes, it is a 1967 dark green Mustang Fastback with cool wheels.  Very nice.  It is not the star of the movie.  We see its dented body a few times and Steve pulls up to the hospital in it.  It is not shot meticulously from low angles and we don't get too much of a feeling of speed.  After all, its not the car that was cool, it was Steve McQueen.  \\"Bullit\\" was Steve's character's name.  And no, it's not a nickname, it's just his last name.  No, not quite as exciting as you thought.    <br />5) The Historical value as a record of the late 60's street scenes (cars and buildings).  Well, if you believe that everyone drove brand new cars (and mostlythe same ones) and there were no ghettos and people only wore proper business attire to do their grocery shopping, then this might make a wonderful 8th grade social-studies history source.  That is provided your history teacher is under 20 and believes everything that the mainstream media had to say about life in the late 1960's.  Of course, this movie was shot in 1967, the year before Robert Kennedy and MLK were bumped off, so everything was perfect, right?.  As for the cars and buildings, the buildings are fine, but we get no sense of where we are in relation to anything (where is the Golden Gate, etc).  And as for the cars, extra lame.  They used one or two cars and moved them around in the background.  They were nothing special or particularly authentic looking either. They use the (exact) same Fords, Chevs and Dodges in every background, and every one is Plain-Jane and brand new.  You might like to look at a brand new 1967 beige Camaro in the year it was built, but how many times, and who cares?  It looks like the big three loaned them their cheapest models, either to save money or to make sure there was nothing special about them so they would \\"blend in\\".  Well, mission accomplished.  So, if you are watching this movie for \\"car candy\\", don't bother. The same three cars are shown over and over, and they are nothing special. This movie stinks of \\"high-dollar low budget\\".  Every expense was spared. There are no recognizable buildings and the repeated use of several props and locations. <br />6) The \\"Tough Cop\\" story with violence and social issues.  If you like to see people blown away by shot guns in glorious Technicolor, well, you'll have to watch closely.  The only scene with real violence is an informant who gets blasted in a sleazy non-descript hotel room.  But we don't see the blast.  No squibs here.  Close up shot gun blast, close up, fast motion of body movement with red stuff on front.  Pull back, actor slumps while holding wound and dies quietly.  I'm not a fan of gore, but again this movie promises seriousness and \\"grittiness\\" yet delivers short cuts and half measures.  Better not to show it at all than do a bad job with poor editing.  As for social issues, it tacks on \\"race relations\\" with a sledge hammer.  It talks about corruption, but does not dare to criticize \\"the system\\" or \\"establishment\\" in any real way.  It tacks on all of the fashionable concerns of the era (late 60's), race relations, government corruption etc, while not saying a thing about them.  <br />7) Because you saw it as a kid.  You probably remember that cool car and how cool it looked and sounded.  The best shot of the movie is a \\"camera car\\" tracking shot of the Mustang with Steve McQueen driving.  It's about 10 seconds long and they do it twice.  This is as good as it gets.  It looks OK and sounds OK.  Any Mustang AD in the day would look and sound as good (or better), and we wouldn't have to sit through another hour and a half of unrelated material.  Also, people have said the sound is great, wrong.  The sound effects are (slightly) out of whack with the action.  When the Mustang passes the Charger (it looks like they used the same shot more than once), the sound of the Mustang's engine seems to sit on top of the action much the way some of the dialogue seems to have that \\"over-processed\\" quality of being \\"fixed in post\\" or over-dubbed.  The engine sounds \\"tough\\" but it clearly doesn't originate with the action.  The revving sounds indicate that the car is being \\"double clutched\\"-something you might need to do in an older car-but it doesn't match the action.  The car is clearly and smoothly accelerating continuously past the other car, he's not in the middle of a shift.  And the sound contains no ambient qualities.  In other words, there is no slight Doppler shift or any other movement-related effects that you might hear under exterior viewing conditions while moving at high speeds down a highway. Details make it worth re-watching, eh?  <br />8) Because you are at a friends house and he saw it as a kid.  He might have liked the fabulous acting and great story, but he might not have seen it recently. The acting is all second-rate.  Steve McQueen stands there and says nothing the entire time.  Oh he looks good, he always looked good.  But we are nearly as frustrated as his middle class girl with her hippie style.  She (and we) can't seem to make a connection to this \\"strong silent type\\".  He lacks any reason for any real angst.  He's good looking, tall, white and smart, or at least self-assured.  He caries a gun and drives a brand new Mustang.  He has an interesting job and he's good at it.  But I guess he's seen a lot of bad things in his time, \\"The kind of ugliness that eats away at a man\\". Except that doesn't seem to be a detriment in his job description.  He's the one that can handle the dead bodies and protects his sensitive girlfriend (you know, the middle class one with the hippie sense of style).  Jeez, come to think of it, most of Bullit's problems seem to be left to our imagination.  I wonder if we are supposed to identify with this emotionally detached man and his young lady?  Wow, this movie talks right to me.  I'm like, totally just like Steve McQueen. And my girl, she says I keep everything bottled up too!  Boy what a good movie.  They sure got me pegged. <br />9) Because it's the only movie you own and you can't get out of the house or turn off the DVD player.  Well then, you're probably not reading this then.  If you are, good for you.  Now throw it away and stop telling your friends how much you liked it. <br />10) And the number 10 reason to watch this movie: Because you want to know if I am exaggerating about how bad it is.  Here's the big Question: why do people still keep watching it (and paying $25 for every new DVD release) if it's no good?  The biggest risk I am taking is that you will have such a low opinion of this movie that you will either seek it out (in order to \\"prove\\" me wrong), or you will have such a low opinion that if you ever do see it (see reason 8) you will say \\"it wasn't that bad.  So here goes.  It is not bad enough to hate (or really laugh at), it's simply not good enough to continue to pay top DVD prices at Wal-Mart every time they re-release the bloody thing! It's not bad enough to be funny.  It plays like a terribly-earnest made-for-TV movie.  It has a preachy quality while saying nothing.  So there is no reason to go back and watch this movie other than \\"everyone always mentions it so I better see it in order to know what they are talking about\\". It lacks the basics.  It lacks characters depth, plot complexity, and theme development. And as icing on the cake, the soundtrack is completely forgettable. The directing and editing and sound are all poor (even though they are over processed, and therefore costly in the day, they are not interesting, enjoyable, or memorable, especially by today's standards.)  They clearly paid nothing for copyrights (no music of the day); there aren't even any product placements to watch for (except for the three cars they keep in circulation). The sets and exterior shots are all irrelevant and contribute nothing to any particular \\"look\\" or \\"feel\\" that might help to establish a theme or a mood.  And the lone car chase (the only real thing defended by anyone in any review) is so riddled with problems and meaningless shifts that it is barely tolerable on first viewing, let alone a second one.  <br />So please, if you are going to review this movie, watch it first so that you may give the most honest and most informed review (or rebuttal to this review) that you can, rather than going on old feelings and memories.  But, having presented this challenge, I have given you one last reason to watch this, and I really don't recommend that at all. <br />
B000002JOH|5.0|<br /> I remember when I was first exposed to this album. It was '92 and as far as music was concerned; no one but Metallica existed. I had gone through two copies of 'Ride The Lightning' and was on a mission to learn how to play their entire catalogue on guitar.  <br /> <br /> I was hanging out with this dude from Texas, talking his ear off about the greatness of Metallica. He finally cut me off and said with a Tejas twang \\"You wanna hear somethin' heavy?\\", and handed me a copy of this album. <br /> <br /> I sat there in absolute awe. It was the most 'in your face' piece of music I had ever heard. I looked like a catatonic kid with headphones on. <br /> <br /> It was this steady groove that at any given moment would spool up, change speeds, and rip your face right off. Not to mention the fact that up until that point I had never heard a vocal delivery as brutal as Phil's. This album is by far bulletproof, and is rightfully mentioned in the same breath as Slayer's Reign In Blood, Metallica's Master Of Puppets, and Megadeth's Rust In Peace. <br /> <br /> No self respecting metal fan, or metal player will doubt the influence and absolute supremacy of this album. <br /> <br /> If you're just getting into metal; this should be at the top of your must have list. <br /> <br /> The cover art is more understatement than advertising.
B00000260F|3.0|In general, I agree with most of the above comments, but as a long-time music lover, I have to rate this album as a must-have for one reason : People Get Ready.  Beck nails the track, and it's probably one of Rod Stewart's best vocal performances. The combination of raspy vocals and Beck's thoughtful, haunting guitar work redeems an otherwise synthetic mish-mash of tracks.  Like was stated before, you can sift through and hear the trademark Beck . I can't help but visualize most of this album as a soundtrack for a mediocre made-for-tv 80s movie. Too bad.
B00005JMAH|3.0|Having gone under new direction in the third movie, along with other problems such as the unfortunate death of Richard Harris, this movie is lacking in several ways.  Too many creative licenses were taken to adapt this film to highlight the action-packed parts that would capture most of the audience's attention.  The problem with this is that it caused every other aspect of the movie to be severely rushed through.  It's the type of feeling one gets when skimming a book, as opposed to sitting down and taking the time to enjoy it.  Important details are left out of the movie inorder to make enough room to dwell on a handful of scenes such as the Knight Bus and the dementor attacks.  In trying to show off the special effects capable, minor effects are disregarded like wand/spell effects for example, meaning there are no visual signs of spells being cast. While granted this is a very minor detail, it could add more to the movie than one might realize. Fight scenes with the wands would be much more visually interesting with this added.  Backstories are shortened or left out completely, there is no character development, and pretty much anything not 100% vital to the story line and out come is disregarded or shoved in as a mere hint or suggestion, where more detail would bring the story to life.<br /><br />Rowling worked hard to create these details and they should not be disregarded. Furthermore, the audience's intelligence should not be insulted by causing the movie to thrive soley on it's visual effects and high-action scenes.<br /><br />On a personal note, my friend, who did not read the book, was not able to follow the movie.  The mark of a great movie re-make of good literature is that is has the ability to be followed and enjoyed without any prior knowledge of the story. These movies should add to the books, not depend upon them even to simply understand the film.  And they certainly should not detract from the books by simply waving shiny things infront of the audiences' face.<br /><br />All in all, the movie was dissapointing but tolerable.  It isn't a *bad* movie, though it certainly could have done a lot better.  It's entertaining, but frustrating and you end the movie feeling slightly unfulfilled. This movie has great potential, but it was not used to the fullest. I reccomend it for Harry Potter fans simply because it is entertaining and of course it has its high points as well as its lows.  It's a love-hate situation.ce. <br />All in all, the movie was dissapointing but tolerable.  It isn't a *bad* movie, though it certainly could have done a lot better.

B0006213H6|4.0|Unlike Sigur Ros's later efforts, Von doesn't demand your attention or emotional involvement at all times. This could be construed as good or bad, depending on your tastes. It is mostly comprised of atmospheric soundscapes and noise experimentation, and there is very little in the way of structured songs. These soothing ambient passages are actually quite pleasant, but don't expect a very engaging listening experiance.<br /><br />However, those structured songs found on this album are extremely good. \\"Hun Jorth\\" (spelled phoenetically because I am too lazy to open the character map) is just as intense and emotional as anything on the ( ) album. I would place this among my all time favorite Sigur Ros songs. \\"Myrkur\\" is the most straightforward rock song I've heard from this band; moody but also in a positive, uplifting way. \\"Von\\" is the first Sigur Ros song sung in the gibberish language jokingly named \\"Hopelandic\\" by the band, after this song, which is Icelandic for \\"Hope.\\" \\"Von\\" is very introspective and calm as well. \\"Syndir Guths\\" appears to be the inspiration for \\"Olsen Olsen\\" as it is in a similar style and even contains the exact same drumbeat.<br /><br />Supposedly, before they were subjected to the tortures of studio experimentation, more of these songs were structured and easier to follow. Anyone who has heard the live version of \\"Haffsol\\" can attest that it barely resembles its studio counterpart in any way. Whether this is good or bad is up to you to decide, but I urge you not to judge this album by how it compares to Agaetis Byrjun and ( ). It is most deffinitly an entirely different animal, beautiful and serene. If you are comfortable with this, I recommend this CD purchase.
B000002J1Y|5.0|One of the best live-albums ever made from a band that was so pivotal and included only masters of their instruments. I prefer to listen to live-albums because in general the sound is more powerful and they deliver often a lot of instrumental extra's. Well, this originally triple LP set is the ultimate live album: great renditions of `classic tracks' like \\"And You And I\\" (beautiful vocals and pedal-steel guitar), \\"Roundabout\\" (excellent guitar and Hammond organ), the epic \\"Close To The Edge\\" (splendid build-up and bombastic climax featuring a majestic church organ sound and fat Minimoog runs) and \\"Starship Trooper\\" (captivating duel between Howe's guitar and Wakeman's Minimoog).  <br /> <br />The extended soli are a perfect example of the typical progrock self-indulgence in those days, especially Rick Wakeman (`the caped crusader') with his wide range of keyboards (MELLOTRON!) among mirrors and explosions in \\"Excerpts From The Six Wives Of Henry VIII\\" and Chris Squire on his Rickenbacker bass in \\"The Fish\\". Steve Howe (using a kind of guitar-museum on tour) creates a warm and pleasant atmosphere with his Spanish guitar in the piece \\"Mood For A Day\\". If I want to let myself carry away with superb 24-carat symphonic rock, this is one of my favorite albums. <br /> <br />No other Yes live album comes close to this. As far as quality goes and the criticism it receives, I just don't get it. Sure it is not the best but what an atmosphere, what an assortment of the finest songs.  <br /> <br />The quality of Genesis - Trespass was also poor, did this detract from the fact that it was a classic album? No ways.Anderson's occasional interraction with the crowd is also perfect.The sleeve design on Yessongs is again by Roger Dean, a three LP fold out.By now the Yes/Dean branding well engrained in the subconcious and adding to the conceptual feel of the albums.Do not overlook thnis essential milestone in the Yes history.
0142437611|5.0|I picked up \\"Seize The Day\\" when, one afternoon, I realized I'd never read anything by Saul Bellow. Throughout high school and college, none of his books had ever been assigned to me, and though I knew his name, it never resonated with me the way the names Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, or Steinbeck had. After reading \\"Seize the Day,\\" I am rather angry at my high school teachers and college professors--and myself!--for keeping me from this author for so long. <br /> <br />\\"Seize The Day\\" tells the story of one day in the life of Tommy Wilhelm, a middle-aged failed actor who now lives in the same New York hotel as his father. Tommy is separated from his wife, and rarely sees his children; furthermore, he has been unemployed for several months, and faces losing the last of his money in an ill-conceived stock market venture. It is with all of this in mind that Tommy finally comes to a day of realization and reckoning, when he realizes his isolation and his failure. <br /> <br />The theme of man's isolation is strong throughout the book, yet it is not what struck me most about Tommy's situation. I read \\"Seize The Day\\" immediately after finishing \\"The Fountainhead,\\" and perhaps that skewed my focus a bit. What I found most interesting about Tommy is his inability to judge himself. He is aware of his failures, but cannot take the final step and truly confront them; he must ask those around him, particularly his father, both for a kind word and for a way to understand himself. I have to wonder if Tommy's isolation would be less of a burden if he weren't also isolated from himself--a thought which struck me to the core. <br /> <br />If you are like me, and have read dozens of American classics without touching a Saul Bellow book, read \\"Seize The Day\\" as soon as possible. Bellow's style of writing and his way of getting inside of Tommy's mind is recognizably American, yet incredibly distinctive; I would venture that you can't fully understand American literature until you've read Saul Bellow.
1401200923|5.0|The \\"Hush\\" series is one in which a new villain, \\"Hush,\\" appears.  It turns out that even Hush, however, is a piece on a giant chess board in which all the Batman universe is a part!<br />An unseen villain manipulates all those around the Dark Knight and nearly destroys him in the process.  Who ends up helping Batman out of the mess is a surprise in itself.<br />  Hush is a series with superb and detailed art.  The plot is good, some of the action scenes are splendid.  Batman fights Robin!<br />  However, what Hush does is resurrect a part of the Batman character that I sorely miss- the Detective.  In fact, I wish they had flushed that part of him out a little more.  Even Batman is perplexed as to the identity of this villain until nearly three quarters through the series.  Using every trace the mysterious manipulator has left behind, those being few and far between, the Dark Knight must bring this madness to an end.<br />  The idea of Hush is much like that, if I understand correctly, of War Games, another recent Batman storyline.  So if you like the one, you will probably like the other. Also Hush vol. 2 is bigger, so you get more for your buck.
0060930187|5.0|Like millions of other young women, I'm sure, I came across \\"The Bell Jar\\" in college, and I felt an immediate attachment to the book: it uplifted me, angered me, scared me, and made me feel deeply protective, all at the same time. <br /> <br />\\"The Bell Jar\\" tells the story of Esther Greenwood, an intelligent college student, as she slowly feels the \\"bell jar\\" of detachment and madness overtake her. As Esther goes from a prestigious internship in New York City to a summer at home with her mother in the Boston suburbs, her attachment to reality becomes more and more tenuous, until thoughts of suicide overtake her. <br /> <br />It is no secret that the story has at least a partial basis in reality, and that Sylvia Plath is writing from her own experience is perhaps what makes Esther so deeply real. I recently wrote a review of \\"Bridget Jones' Diary,\\" and although \\"The Bell Jar\\" is undoubtedly a better book, there is a certain similarity between the protagonists: like Bridget, Esther is a character who is almost universally relatable. It does not matter if the reader is psychologically healthy or not: Esther awakens what she is feeling in all of us. My emotional response to \\"The Bell Jar\\" was on par with my emotional response to certain real-life events. I was uplifted to find a shared experience; angered at Esther's responses--and at the fact that they seemed reasonable to me; scared at the uncertainty I felt about myself and my own psychological state by the end of the book; and deeply protective--of Esther, of Sylvia Plath, and of every other reader who shared my experience. <br /> <br />I recognize that specifically speaking of the female experience when reading \\"The Bell Jar\\" could be considered rather narrow-minded of me. I certainly believe that this book can resonate with men as well, just as \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" can resonate with women. There is something deeply female in Esther's experience, however, and I cannot put into words the extent of my appreciation that Plath was able to give a true voice to this femaleness, without getting defensive and without getting melodramatic.
B000002KBD|5.0|A classic. \\"I'll Be Your Lover, Too\\" is fabulous. Not a bad song on this one. <br /> <br />I heard that a remastered version of this one is due for release this year?
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I must say that I really wasn't sure what to expect from this CD when I received it as a baby shower gift.  Now that I have had my child, I feel as if it is probably the most beautiful and heartfelt CD I have ever heard.  Maybe if you are not a Mother you cannot fully understand the meaning of the words, but for anyone who has ever had a child, there is no denying that each song touches your heart.  I will give this as a baby shower gift from now on.  I rock my baby to sleep with this music and it is calming and the words are full of love.
B0009XRZ9W|5.0|This movie is an instant Christmas Classic. It belongs on the shelf with A Christmas Story, Christmas Vacation, Miracle on 34th street and the rest. Great movie for adults that have become Scrooges over time.  <br /> <br />And to the person who said \\"I expected it to be bad, but it was worse\\", you are officially the first person I have ever heard of that saw a movie that they expected to be bad. Why spend the money? And if you dont like feel good movies, DONT GO SEE THEM! Leave them to us people that do like that kind of thing!
B0000508U6|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out. I was in sixth grade and into metal but the first time I saw the music video for yellow on mtv2 at 2 in the morning I became enchanted. This is a perfect album there is not a single song on here that isn't worth while. Coldplay's \\"Parachutes\\" is the culmination of everything thats good in music: lyrics, charisma, emotion, and musicianship. This album provides a soundscape that isn't necessarily present in the other two, also Chris Martin's emotional anguish is beautiful instead of the near whininess he can sometimes exude later. Guy Berryman's bass on tracks like \\"high speed\\" and \\"sparks\\" is superb. Johnny Buckland and Will Champion are also on point, both I think are very underated Champion is very much a power drummer and Buckland I think creates more touching guitar pieces than the Edge. The whole album can be played over and over again each song running into eachother but there are standout tracks. \\"Yellow\\" is a masterpiece but gems like \\"highspeed\\" \\"don't panic\\" and \\"parachutes\\" do more than carry their weight. This is a must have album for anyone, also check out Souvlaki by Slowidive.
B000957O7S|4.0|and 30% raw physical humor. 30 is good, hang in there.<br /><br />The nominal plot says that \\"Hitch\\" (as in \\"get hitched\\") is a one-on-one personal image consultant for those one-on-one situations that every male since Adam hasn't known how to handle. He's found out by a member of the target sex (hetero, so that means ladies here), and bad things and happy endings follow. OK, I'm hapy ignoring that 70%.<br /><br />The 30% that includes raw physical humor hurt me laughing. Will Smith is as usual, suave, in control, and as silly as he needs to be. Eva Mendez ('Sara') is pretty and earnest.<br /><br />Kevin James - Albert - walks away with the show in his pocket. He's a bit tubby (and knows it), and an utterly inept geek. He does a lot in this movie, all good, but it's his physical humor that grabs the show and drags it home behind him. He has mastered the prat-fall, the no-pants scene, the embarassing dance, and the million other daily experiences of the human male. What's worse is that he shows them, and worse yet is that every guy in the room crosses his legs and thinks \\"my god I hoped no one saw when I did that.\\"<br /><br />But it works. It features Smith in some self-important mugging (c'mon guys, did your date ever get you onto the front page? or even the police blotter?) And everyone ends up happily ever after, as required by law.<br /><br />Fun, fluffy, and witless. If you have a mindless evening coming up, this might meet it on its own terms. 'Fun' is the key word, though.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002OVJ|5.0|The Who is simply amazing in this album. There aren't a lot of rock and roll bands that are actually better live than in the studio, but The Who certainly makes the list. The magic starts with \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and doesn't stop as the album goes through such hits as \\"Summertime Blues\\" and \\"Shakin' All Over,\\" and also some less-known songs that are nonetheless just as good. \\"A Quick One\\" shows The Who's ability to be humorous at the same time as writing good music. All the members are incredibly talented, especially Keith Moon, who is undoubtedly one of the best drummers in history. In short, The Who shows their stuff yet again, and even surpasses their studio music.
0451191153|5.0|A friend gave me this book my last term in college, and when I started reading it I could not put it down.  I read it in class, before work, and at home.  After college, thinking about this book helped to motivate me and pursue my career with vigor.  I wanted to be Howard Roark.  This is a great novel.
B00006M183|5.0|I had heard this wasn't anywhere near Pearl Jam's best CD, I even heard it wasn't any good. Despite the poor recomendations, I decided to buy it. I went in with low expectations but came out thinking the world of PJ. It astounds me that they can keep making such amazing music after so long. There's not a single song by them that I don't like, and with having as much music out as they do, that's a feat in itself. This CD seems to have a flow that their others don't. From the heavy hitters of Save You and Get Right to the softer anthems of I Am Mine and All Or None, this is one of the most diverse records in years.<br /><br />Can't Keep starts off the CD well enough. Not their best opening song, but not the worst either. Love Boat Captain is possibly my favorite song on here. With intense lyrics that are sung like a true pro and a musical backdrop to die for, you cannot go wrong. Ghost sounds like I've heard it before, not by them, but by another band. I Am Mine is a very empowering song. Very haunting in it's delivery though. You Are is by far the catchiest song I've heard in recent memory. The way Ed sings the verses is complete euphoria. His voice soars here. Bushleaguer is, as we all know, a direct hit towards George Bush. It's a nice song with spoken word verses and a memorable chorus. Arc, while not having any words, might be the most powerful song on this CD. It seems to me like it would've been a nice opening track, but it fits well where it is. All Or None isn't the best track to finish with. Even substituting in Arc would've been better by my judgement. I do like the chorus however. I just think Ed could've put a little more emotion in it.<br /><br />A few of my favorite songs are Save You, Love Boat Captain, I Am Mine, You Are, and Arc. While no, this isn't the best PJ release, it definitely deserves more attention that what it has gotten. The lyrics are as thought-provoking and beautiful as ever, and Mike's guitar work only seems to get better with age. I do feel Ed could have tried a little harder though. He's got, in my opinion, one of the best voices in rock today, I just wish he'd sing like he did on Vs. Other than that, this is a staple in the PJ catalog..

0783227434|5.0|The Evil Dead trilogy, think Evil Dead = genuine horror + low budget, Evil Dead II = horror + `comedic' moments + higher budget, Evil Dead III = comedy + high budget, its possibly the best way to look at the trilogy. <br /> <br />AOD is a classic film, well worth watching over and over again as it has: <br /> <br />Fantastic one liners?  Check <br />Hero with chainsaw for hand? Check <br />Witch killing?          Check <br />Gratuitous use of shotgun? Check <br />Bruce Campbell?   Check <br />Love interest?   Check <br />Good triumphing over evil? Check <br /> <br />It ticks all the right boxes and never leaves the viewer disappointed.  I highly recommend this film, if you loved Dusk Till Dawn - AOD rivals it on the Macho Pimp Stud scale.   <br /> <br />Not recommended if you are a horror junkie and are wanting shock value, this is not for you sir. <br /> <br />Coming back from the pub and I have the choice of reaching for Raging Bull or AOD, the chainsaw wielding great one will win every time... <br /> <br />Hail to the king, baby... <br />
0596007124|5.0|I don't know why it takes teachers and authors so long to understand that there is theory and evidence in regard to how people learn and retain information.  The Head First series is excellent and imparts and solidifies information.  It helps that what they are explaining is accurate and well understood.  Thank you head first people and pattern understanding people.  You make lives more fun.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Where as \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" and \\"Wall Street\\" perfectly encapsulated the 70's and 80's (respectively) \\"Fight Club\\" did the same for the consumer driven, dot-com world of the (late) 90's.   <br /> <br />Who of us could not relate to Ed Norton's insomniac, hate-your-job and life character?  His frustration for his career is so vivid (and not played for fun, ala \\"Office Space\\"), that this is possibly Norton's best performance (considering his body of work that is really saying something).   <br /> <br />And Brad Pitt? He was born to be Tyler Durden. Pitt is phenomenal as Durden and commands each scene he is in with such charismatic force, he forever erases the \\"pretty boy\\" tags that have been unfairly cast upon him. <br /> <br />While they are often overlooked (in the midst of powerhouse performances by Norton and Pitt), Helena Bonham Carter's Marla Singer is a sympathetic and integral character, as is Meatloaf's Robert \\"Bob\\" Paulsen. <br /> <br />As for the violence...it is necessary. David Fincher truly wants all to understand the rage and frustration of Norton's character and all the members of the Fight Club and there was no other way to do it (hell, it is called FIGHT Club!).  The film is not as violent as many are lead to believe, and certainly not as brutal or distressing as say Clockwork Orange (which this film is often compared too).  <br /> <br />While Fight Club is a masterpiece...it is not for all audiences and some will just not get it.  Repeated viewings are recommended to get all the little twists and to get the dark humor (yes...parts are very comical!) and check out all the commentaries (there are 4 different ones). <br /> <br />Last Thought: The best line in Fight Club, \\"This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time\\" is a classic one and, while will never enter pop culture mainstream the way lines from \\"Scareface\\" or \\"Sudden Impact, have\\" it certainly hits home and has more personal relevance than many other tired and overused quotes. <br/> <br />Fight Club is a Classic!! <br />
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE. <br />When i first rented it I only bought it because of the video to Lady Marmalade. How simple was that? Well i watched the video and was satisfied and was just gonna send the movie back. But then I decided to watch it. I was blown away by the first dance scene in which Christian first goes to Moulin Rouge and how they put that together! I love that scene and all of the music/dance scenes in the movie. I cried so bad at the end! I truly felt for Christian. I finally got this movie from a friend who said she didn't like it. How could that be but i guess it's not for everyone. My sister even says it was weird until she got into it and my niece really likes it also and she's only 8! She just loves the dancing in the movie by the girls. The acting, singing, music and feeling are genuine and I wish more movies were like this one.  <br />So I finally own this SPECTAULAR two-disc set! I have also found a couple of easter eggs on the second disc. They only have a little scene they play but i think it's cute because they are in the shape of the green fairy.  <br />Some special features i really like are: <br />The music video for COME WHAT MAY very cool techno beat to it. <br />The music video for LADY MARMALADE which features Missy Elliott. <br />The extended dance sequences (especially The Can-Can) <br />The first rehearsals for the dance sequences (which features a very funny rehearsal for Like A Virgin) <br />The photo galleries <br /> <br />All in all i love this movie and the extra stuff and i thank my friend Stacy for giving this DVD to me.
B0006L16N8|4.0|After just one listening, I didn't feel this is as good as their previous album, but I still liked most of the songs.  The first single, Speed of Sound, is a great song and I suspect there will be a few more singles that will be well-received.  And, I suspect I will like this album better after a few more listens.  As for comparisons to U2 or Radiohead, I don't get it: they don't sound like either--they just sound like themselves.  So like them or not--but give this album a chance because it deserves it!
B000001GQB|5.0|Since childhood I have had these symphonies with Boehm and I still enjoy listening to them, I am still not bored, and I can say that not much music has proved that solid. Perhaps I'm crazy, but the last years the symphony no. 38 has even improved in my ears. I always have imagined the last three (39, 40, 41) as orderly as a classic park. The first movement of no. 35 is famous for its counterpoint.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I can't be the only moviegoer who despises the flashy, glossy superhero movie equivalents of cult comics, whose release mainly consists of commercial advertising and a major profit of the home entertainment industry. I just can't. Batman Begins clearly isn't backed by a McDonald's Happy Meal and clearly deserves credit for representing the protagonist more as abstract concepts, the chief of which is on the theme of Fear.<br /><br />I won't go into the whole movie beyond the fact that I was completely impressed with the cast of characters (because of the \\"star-studded\\" quality that usually turns me off) and their unbelievable ability to bury themselves in the thick plot. I recommend to you, the moviegoer, to forget the Fantastic Four, screw the Spiderman, and dump the Daredevil. Go see a real hero and not just some over-the-top screenplay from characters with quirks and powers. Go see the movie that revived the horrors of a campy series. Go see Batman Begins, and be satisfied.
B000001G5A|5.0|I cannot claim that no other Mozart Requiem is as good as this. Still I don't need any other. If this is slow, it is a slowness that is needed to let the power of drama to unfold. Mozart never wrote anything as profoundly tragic as this work. In my opinion there are two great Mozart directors, for all their differences: Boehm and Gardiner. Perhaps I buy the Gardiner later, perhaps not. I can do with this some more years.    PS: August 2006: After recommendation, I've got the Peter Schreier-performance of the Requiem. It is leaner and clearer, as good sung as this; many will claim much better - but still I am not finished with my Boehm. In fact, the Schreier only reinforces my love for the Boehm-version. It seems to be definite as far as I am concerned.   PS 11th July 2007: Meanwhile I have bought the Requiem conducted by Rafael Fruhbeck De Burgos, brisker tempos, which feel just right. I never listen to the Boehm nor the Schreier anymore... I regret my five stars, sorry, should only be four. See the five star Rafael Fruhbeck De Burgos here:  [[ASIN:B000026GD1 Mozart: Requiem]]
B0006L16N8|5.0|I don't care what anybody else says; this album may be a little overdone but it IS full of great songs.  From who else would you hear the transcendant \\"What If\\", the pumping \\"White Shadows\\" and the twisted \\"Twisted Logic\\" in one album?  Sure A RUSH... was fantastic and is hard to beat and maybe this is not as good but I still love it lots.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie was a large steaming turd. I am one who has always been intrigued by any type of movie..not being able to take my eyes away from it (especially if i paid money for it). But while watching Napoleon, I couldn't barely stay awake. All of you fans out there, stop and REALLY think about this movie...what is there to laugh at?...truly? Oh I know what it is! \\"This film is artsy/cool and if I laugh at it then I WILL BE ARSTY/COOL!!! AND EVERYONE IN RETURN WILL THINK THAT I AM AWESOME!!\\" People keep telling me \\"Oh well some people just don't understand it and the others completely 'get it'\\". News flash: There is nothing to get. And if I am a part of the group that 'doesn't get it' then God bless us all because we actually have a brain. Jesus. Please go rent a genuine comedy and prevent yourselves from torture.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Okay, so hoping you'll get 20 totally classic tracks in one purchase is hoping for too much, but as with all FF releases, there's lots of good stuff to be enjoyed.  My biggest complaint is that Dave & Co. seem to be writing more \\"breakup songs\\" than ever before - inching toward emo and leaving 'grunge' in the dust - so here's what I did: Took 7 of the \\"loud\\" songs and 3 of the \\"quiet\\" ones and made a killer mix CD (yes, there are ways to copy this thing), creating some nice dynamic shifts over the course of the disc.  It's riding with me in the car and getting lots of play!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Having read most of the reviews of this album, I decided to write one myself. Now, call me biased or whatever, but I have all of Britney's albums. I am a Britney fan. I've loved her music from way back when it was \\"...Baby One More Time\\" right up until her last release, \\"Do Somethin'\\". I have all five of her albums, plus a few singles and a DVD here or there. But 'In the Zone' is without a doubt my favourite of her albums. <br /> <br />You just have to listen to a hand full of tracks from her first album to see how much she has grown, improved  and really come into her own style. Each song is different, some holding techno edged dance floor mania, to sexy breathy mid tempos, all the way to painfully honest ballads. There is something for everyone here. <br /> <br />My personal favourites from the album (other than the singles) are \\"Breathe on Me\\" and \\"Touch of my Hand\\". Each track is amazingly written and compliments Britney's voice well. Say what you want about her face/style/husbands/body but you cannot dent that this is a truely magnificent album. There is no 'filler' not dud song on here. From start to finish it is quality pop. A highly recomment purhcasing this album, wether you're a Britney Spears fan or not. You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />And to those who compare her this album or indees Britney's musical style to by-gone eras, I have three words for you - \\"GET OVER IT\\" - the 60s, 70s, and 80s are done and gone. Stop living in the past and get with the times. Britney has defined a generation's sound and style, and no-one, not Christina, Beyonce, Jessica Simpson, J.Lo or any other wannabe-Britney 'diva' will ever compare. Like it or not, Britney is a front runner in todays' musical style, and with albums like \\"In the Zone\\" its clear why she is.
B00005JNTV|4.0|This animated comic book is a marvellous gem that we should all see, watch and scrutinize several times a day to convince ourselves that the world has reached a no-return point. The black and white pictures are shockingly beautiful with subtle nuances in the greys and in the playing on light, or absence of light. The use of colors in that dark environment fascinates our eyes and mesmerizes our minds. The symbolic values of these colors are kind of simple though. Red as the color of blood or prostituted love is quite banal. Babylon is never very far away when red jumps into the picture. Yellow is funnier since it is the color of the arch-criminal, the senator's son. But yellow is also the color of fearful jaundice and of the cavalry, though the cavalry is not supposed to be afraid of anything and this barbaric torturer of a senator's son is not bouncing onto us to protect women and children, but rather to cut children into slices and transform women's heads into hunting trophies. The plot itself is sort of entangled : one plot in another and one crime in still another like so many russian dolls. Ir is fascinating to see all those super-heroes die and revive periodically. But the film is quite more pessimistic than Spiderman because there is no hope of an escape, no hope of a regeneration, no hope of an end to a neverending cycle of rotting and decaying because crime comes with power and power brings crime, since power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, as is well-known. So do not forget to see that film if you do not want to die in ignorance.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B00001PE4D|3.0|This film doesn't try to be great. You all act like it won a bunch of awards or something, so you must be outraged. It's just some dumb little teen movie, why does it upset you so much? I'd like to know what you were actually EXPECTING from this movie going in, cinematic genius? As far as it being \\"offensive\\"...pay more attention to the ratings next time. This movie is rated --->R&lt;---. Stick to Stuart Little and Grease if you are that touchy. <br /> <br />Basic plot: Kathrine and Sebastian are rich step-siblings who get their jollies by hurting other people. They make a bet that Sebastian can seduce Annette, the virtuous daughter of their school's principal. Sebastian can't decide if he's in love with Annette or Kathrine. <br />Sub-plot: Katherine's boyfriend dumped her for the innocent, virginal Cecile. Katherine gets revenge by having Sebastian corrupt her, and turn her into a tramp(so her boyfriend won't want her), and getting Cecile in trouble in other cruel ways. Sebastian becomes torn, he is so disgusted with his behavior, but he still thinks he's in love with his step-sister. <br /> <br />As far as teen movies go, this one was somewhat sophisticated. I know that isn't saying much. <br /> <br />The music is a big plus. Think of movies like American Pie, where you can't go five minutes without having to suffer through some moronic pop-punk tune. This is one of the worst things about teen movies. They assume the audience has such a short attention span that we can only concentrate on the movie if we have a new song every scene. Anyway, the music in this movie is good. It's not intrusive and the songs aren't bad. The song at the end fits perfectly (Bittersweet Symphony) <br /> <br />The acting was indeed cheesy. But I think that's how they WANTED it to be. It worked. It's not that they \\"can't act\\". They were SUPPOSED to be over the top. That's why one of the gay guys was so femme, and the other was the typical macho homophobe who is secretly gay. Not because the director was a homophobe, but because this movie is supposed to be over the top and decadent! Lighten up. <br /> <br />The script was unimaginative, and the dialogue somewhat weak. But it wasn't terrible, and the overall story was decent, and admittedly unoriginal. <br /> <br />I think this is worth a rental at least, assuming you are under thirty or have a good sense of humor. Don't take it so seriously. This movie is not, by any stretch of imagination, a masterpiece. But what does it say about you, if that's what you expected it to be? Good fun.
B00003CX9W|4.0|just for children!  It has developed that way in the US because of Disney and Hanna-Barbara, but it was not originally just for kids, and as it has developed in Asia and Europe it still isn't.  Look at the old 'Loony Toons', for example; a lot of the humor goes right over children's heads, but can be appreciated by adults. <br /> <br />To the people who say that children don't like this because there is no story line, as a child I loved it.  Of course, I grew up in a home filled with classical music--my late Mother was an Eastman-trained musician--so perhaps I was different. <br /> <br />As for the censorship of the black centaurette, Disney is in a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation.  Back when the film was first released, people didn't think anything of such 'humor'.  It was a different time, and it is wrong to judge other cultures by our culture's standards.  Now, of course, it is totally unacceptable.  If Disney were to release it in the original, they'd be called racist; if in the edited version, they are called censors. <br /> <br />Some have objected to the 'Night on Bald [or BEAR] Mountain' sequence as evil and Satanic; well, it is supposed to be.  There IS evil in the world, and the sooner children discover this the better.  And Disney does not leave us there; the demons are stopped in thir revelry by the Angelus bell, and we close with the vision of the Schubert 'Ave Maria'. <br /> <br />'Allegro non Troppo' and 'Opera Imaginaire' give us some idea of other possibilities of combining good music with animation; more along those lines should be done.
0671799320|5.0|\\"The Prize\\" starts out as a business history textbook and builds into a review and interpretation of the modern world. It presents a rich and cohesive analysis of the world we currently live in and provides a framework for viewing world affairs. Highly recommended.
B000002A46|5.0|My oh my oh my. Someone wake me up me from this pearl enveloped dream consisting of pure fascination and enjoyment. Miss Mariah Carey explodes onto the scene with a flawless effort, spectacularly sung with astonishing vocals. As a music reviewer i must say in all my years have i never been so tremendously impressed. Mariahs renditions of such songs as O holy night, and silent night are startling, while her executions of joy to the world, and jesus born on this day will leave ur spine shivering with excitment and unable to contain itself. The superior range and honey coated power of this singer, on this album, is unsurpassed. She has deservedly claimed herself as queen of the Christmas albums, she is Mariah Carey.

B0006L16N8|4.0|You know, this is an almost great CD. Their first two are a little better. This one does not grow on you. Go and buy the new Oasis album instead, that is a grower
B000069AUI|4.0|A Rush of Blood to the Head is a work of art. Whenever I listen to this CD I start at the first one and just leave it on, that's what I love about it--I don't have very many CDs in my collection that I can play with absolutely no track skipping. It's really the perfect thing for me to listen to, at any time. It's like a Coldplay tradition to capture almost every type of emotion in their albums (I don't know about X&Y, I haven't listened to the whole thing, but from what I have heard I can't say I love it like I love this).  <br /> <br />\\"Politik\\" is one of the more serious songs, It's very unique for Coldplay because it gets pretty loud and almost angry. It's so catchy it's hard not to like it. <br /> <br />\\"In My Place\\" is definitely one of my favorite songs on the album. It's all about that riff, man.. I just can't escape how 'nice' it is. I feel good whenever I hear it. <br /> <br />\\"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face\\" has another great riff to it, it kind of makes you go \\"Hell yeah\\" when it starts. Good driving song. <br /> <br />\\"The Scientist\\" is a pretty decent song, most fans love it. It takes a bit of waiting to get to the good parts of the song, like the chorus. The chorus makes me feel awesome when I hear it for some reason. <br /> <br />Everyone likes \\"Clocks\\"... right? At least if you haven't heard it a thousand times everywhere you looked in the past couple of years, which I have. After I finally bought the CD I gave it a worthy listen and it began to grow on me. I can dig it. <br /> <br />\\"Daylight\\" is not particularly memorable, but not quite a track that deserves to be skipped. Catchy as always. <br /> <br />\\"Green Eyes\\" is a favorite. What a humble, Johnny Cash-like song. It's all acoustic, and has another sweet chorus. <br /> <br />\\"Warning Sign\\" is a little bit less catchy than the rest.. now that I think about it, it's the only track I might end up skipping. Nice chorus though. <br /> <br />\\"A Whisper\\" grows on you, or at least it did for me. It's actually pretty uplifting. <br /> <br />\\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is AWESOME. Really, really awesome. I like everything about this song and I'll leave it at that. <br /> <br />\\"Amsterdam\\" is pretty cool. I like the acoustics and the tone.. it's actually a perfect way to end the album. I hope this was helpful.

B0007CNXUK|2.0|I read many glowing reviews on this site and others. These reviews were very eloquent, almost suspiciously so. I have always wondered if the studios pay people to write reviews on online sites. This movie strongly confirms this suspicion. I can't believe I am seeing the same movie these people watched. I was barely able to sit through the whole thing. It is just too slow and predictable.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Wow! I borrowed it from the library yesterday. I watched it the night before and I watched it the morning before I went to school. It was awesome. And the lines were well thought out. Like when Tommy (Speck) Gnosis asked Hedwig if he accepts Jesus Christ as his personal lord and savior. And then Tommy goes on this mini-monologue about the Genesis Tree and the apple. That was pretty intense. This movie is definitely a must have for every DVD collection.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Who hasn't thought twice about getting into the water after seeing \\"Jaws\\"?  Although the popularity of some horror/creature movies may fall by the wayside, the 1975 film has stood the test of time.  This Steven Spielberg movie successfully combines the fear of the unknown with a plot that stays within the borders of realism.  The result is one of cinema's enduring movies that is effective today as it was when it was first released. <br /> <br />It's the height of tourist season on Amity Island when a body washes up on the shore.  When Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) investigates and determines the woman was killed by a shark attack, his results are overruled by Amity Island's governing body.  Another attack quickly ensues, this time leaving a young boy dead. <br /> <br />Amity Island has two choices:  close the beaches which would result in the town going bankrupt or offer a bounty on the shark's head.  Soon Amity Island is swamped with overzealous shark hunters trying to cash in on the award. <br /> <br />In the meantime, Brody has called in shark enthusiast and scientist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), who confirms that not only is the culprit a shark but also an enormous Great White.  His findings, however, fall on deaf ears as the citizens of Amity Island prepare for their biggest celebration of the year.  This time the result is a shark attack during the festivities. <br /> <br />Now it is up to Brody, Hooper and a crusty seaman, Quint (Richard Shaw), to track down the man-eating shark and destroy it.  While traveling on Quint's old boat, The Orca, the trio soon find their lives in peril.  Will they be able to destroy the shark that hunts them? <br /> <br />\\"Jaws\\" proves that not seeing a creature in every scene makes a movie scarier.  Although we assume the shark is near when we hear the music or see a fin darting through the water, we never actually see the entire shark until the end of the movie; proving that sometimes less is more. <br />   <br />The movie, although a little slow in a couple parts, moves along quickly.  Each of the actors plays a convincing role to keep everyone watching intrigued.  This is particularly true of the scene with Brody, Hooper and Quint reminiscing on the Orca right before the shark attacks. <br /> <br />\\"Jaws\\" does stray a bit from the book by Peter Benchley, preferring to focus only on the story of the shark that brings terror to Amity Island.  Other than that minor point, the only thing that the film could have included would have been more interaction between Brody and his wife Ellen (Lorraine Gary).  Her character became more defined in later films. <br /> <br />Despite the overwhelming production mishaps, \\"Jaws\\" is an exceptional movie.  A beachgoer will never look at the ocean quite the same. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|4.0|The expectations to Coldplay's new album were without doubt some of the highest to a rock album this year. It's been three years since their previous album; which contained the great singles \\"In My Place\\", \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Clocks\\". An album that seems hard to live up to. The big question was, could this band do it again? Personally I think  it's difficult to give a clear answer to that qustion.<br /><br />The first single from \\"X & Y\\", \\"Speed of Sound\\" is fine, but not nearly as high-profiled as their earlier singles. In a way this could be said about many of the songs on this new album. Fine songs and music, but, at least in the beginning, the tracks seem hard to distinguish from each other.<br /><br />The first track that really caught my attension was the hymn-like \\"Fix You\\" which was refreshingly different from 3 first songs - a highlight on the album.<br /><br />Among other songs that stand out the could-be \\"next singles\\" \\"Talk\\" and \\"The Hardest Park\\" deserve to be brought out.<br /><br />The acoustic and melodic \\"A Message\\" is just beautiful, as is the ballad \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\".<br /><br />But if only one song was allowed to be brought out, it would without question be the closing track \\"Till Kingdom Comes\\". It's such a beautiful song, that you have get hold of your guitar and find out how it goes. A new classic is born!<br /><br />Conclusion: I must admit that after the first \\"hearing\\", I was a little disappointed, but now more songs are beginning to grow on me; and any album containing a song like \\"Till Kingdom Comes\\" is well worth seeking out.
B000000W5B|4.0|I have this album for 8 years. I always liked it. But recently I pulled it out again after not hearing it for a while, and I gotta say this is one of the better and more subtle Rolling Stones albums. I almost hear it as a flipside or extension to exile on main street. It's one of their more organic sounding albums and I think because there are less recognizable hits that alot of people won't be into it. Give it time though it may grow on you.
B00020HEL6|4.0|It's hard to believe that she's an eighth grader: she sings so sexy at times that it verges on the inappropriate; she sings too well for someone who has so little experience. Where did she learn to sing like this? <br />It is tempting to think of her as a wind-up doll, really good at following directions. <br />So if I don't think of her age, this is a good disk. Uneven and overly orchestrated at times (including a number that brings back -- alas -- the days of Ray Coniff). (Ms. Olstead has probably never heard of Ray Coniff.) But she can sing, she has some delightful twists on melody and tempo, and only occasionally does the little girl voice come through. She does sound like Diana at times, though, interestingly, not on \\"What a Difference.\\"  <br />She's not Tierney Sutton (yet?) but nobody is. She's a whole lot more than many out there.
B00013BN4S|5.0|December 7, 1974 my friend Early and I went to see Leo Kottke at Minnesota Orchestra Hall. The opening act that night was an unknown girl singer named Emmylou Harris. We had no idea what to expect and little interest - we'd come to see Kottke. As soon as we saw Emmylou, we began to get interested and when she opened her mouth and started singing, we were completely and totally mesmerized. A voice like nothing we'd ever heard before. And, a voice that is still instantly identifiable. <br /> <br />Pieces Of The Sky came out early in 1975 and I was almost afraid to play it, afraid that it could never match what I remembered from that cold December night. But as soon as the needle hit the record, I knew that it was everything I remembered and more. \\"Bluebird Wine\\", \\"The Bottle Let Me Down\\", songs that really show that she can make a song move. \\"If I Could Only Win Your Love\\", the first of many Louvin Brothers songs that she exposed to a whole new audience. And my favorite, \\"Too Far Gone.\\" Everything about the way \\"Too Far\\" is produced says that it should be a disaster. I mean, heavy strings, for Pete's sake? Instead, Emmylou makes both the song and the arrangement a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Since \\"Pieces\\", I've bought nearly all of Emmylou's works and have rarely been disappointed. I would urge anyone who doesn't own this disc, to get it immediately. It's a timeless piece of work that stands as well today as it did when it was released 30 years ago.  <br /> <br />Thanks for all you've done for country music, Emmylou. I just wish that today's Nashville suits would go back and listen to this CD and and understand how beautiful three chords and the truth can sound. They - and we - need you more than ever.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This was the film which introduced me (and many others in the 1980s) to Miyazake, and even in the form of a poor quality VHS on an ordinary TV, it was amazing. By 1984 Miyazake was already well known in Japan for his anime work in film, TV, and for the comic strip that this film was based upon.<br /><br />In this early full length film he really got to spread his wings. There are fantastic aerial sequences like the jet-glider evading the flying snakes, which (this predates computed 3D, and aerial sequences are present in most of his work) are just a tour-de-force of imagination and geometry. And yet this is a world that feels very organic, not geometric, with a cast of characters drawn in a unique cross between hobo, samurai, and pirate - totally blending in to an imaginary post apocalyptic world where humans scratch out a precarious life in villages hidden in the few green valleys left in a world of desert, where the only remaining resources are wind, sunlight, and humans.<br /><br />But it is also a world of enormous dangers, including airborne bandits and the strange, mutated creatures that have evolved to control the barren and scarred earth. When our heroine's valley home is attacked by raiders, she embarks on an adventure against them that will lead her, and some unlikely allies found along the way, to an eventual confrontation combining warring armies of bandits, ancient machines of infernal destruction, and the implacable, mysterious, threatening beasts which roam the badlands. The pace is swashbuckling - if this were a book, it would be one you could not stop reading.<br /><br />It has the feel of the original comic books, but plays out wonderfully on the screen - you don't need to know the comics. The style is very unique. Even though it is very stylized (no photorealism here), you immediately get the feeling of the world and the characters. The story works for children of all ages (mine both first saw this before they were 6, and have memorized it long since), and combined with the wonderful visuals it is a treat for adults too. As a genre I would classify it as soft (no attempt at scientific correctness) sci-fi rather than fantasy, though some might think it more a work of fantasy. It is fascinating partly because its roots in style and action are unexpected for a western viewer. Japanese manga and stories had evolved in their own way, and although this is early Miyazake, it is already a product of that mature and distinct art form.<br /><br />As always with Miyazake - if you haven't seen his work, well you haven't seen anything like it, and it is time you did.ong since), and combined with the wonderful visuals it is a treat for adults too.

Buy from Amazon they are more forgiving. Otherwise this movie kicks butt!! i would have gave it 5 stars except for the dvd problem.

B00005JNJT|4.0|Your overall opinion of this movie is entirely dependent on your personal relationship with the Batman franchise. Let me explain: I saw this movie with my fianc&eacute;. He grew up reading the Batman comic books. I have never opened a Batman comic in my life. My impressions of Batman were solely based on watching reruns of the old Adam West TV series and then seeing the first four Batman films. Therefore, it's not surprising at all that my fianc&eacute; enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did. I can appreciate the film for what it was trying to do, but it just didn't win me over completely.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" basically throws out everything that happens in the first four Batman films and starts from scratch. We get to see Bruce Wayne as a child and as a young man. The film does a great job of exploring Bruce's character, which I thought was fabulous. According to my fianc&eacute;, there are also a lot of incidents and characters in this movie that are taken from the original comic books which have never been utilized in the movie franchise before, such as Morgan Freeman's character. That was pretty cool.<br /><br />Here are some things I liked and disliked about the film:<br /><br />+ Christian Bale did a great job as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Some people have complained that his Batman voice and characterization are too similar to his Bruce Wayne persona. I think that's the effect they were going for, though, and I had no problem with it. (Bale looks like a young Dylan McDermott, though...it's creepy. I was like, \\"Why is that guy from 'The Practice' wearing the Bat Suit?!'\\")<br /><br />+ I love the fact that the Bat Cave was an ACTUAL CAVE that Bruce fell into as a child. The whole concept of him having to overcome his fear of bats was brilliant. (And those bats were SPOOKY! Great special effects!)<br /><br />+ When the first publicity photos of the Batmobile were released about a year ago, I was disgusted by them...why were they making it look like a Monster Truck? I sorely misjudged the new vehicle, though...it was AWESOME! I love the scene where the police radio a description of the car: \\"It's a black...tank.\\"<br /><br />+ Michael Caine did a great job as Alfred. No one will ever take Michael Gough's place in my heart, but Caine made the character his own and brought a lot of classy humor to the role. (\\"All those pushups every day and you can't even lift a bloody log!\\")<br /><br />+ Liam Neeson. He's fabulous in everything he does, and this film was no exception. He did a great job in all those fight scenes!<br /><br />- Katie Holmes...she was SO AWFUL! I laughed out loud during the scene where her character slapped Bruce Wayne twice in the car...she looked like she was swatting at flies! It was SO PAINFUL to watch!<br /><br />- The Scarecrow character really freaked me out. My fianc&eacute; tells me that he was exactly how the comic books depicted him, so I guess that's a good thing, but I miss classic villains like Catwoman and the Joker.<br /><br />- I really didn't enjoy the first 40 minutes of the movie, and the idea that Bruce Wayne was trained by a pack of Ninjas in the mountains still does not sit well with me. I understand the need to explain how Bruce was trained, but the whole Ninja concept was just a tad overboard, in my opinion.<br /><br />The bottom line with this film is that it's really good for what it is, but people who were expecting this to be like the Michael Keaton movies are going to be slightly disappointed. I think that the most important thing is that the Batman franchise has been reinvigorated. Hopefully there will be more movies in the future...and with any luck, Katie Holmes won't be in any of them!

B000957O82|2.0|I rented this movie in the hope that I would laugh, but I didn't. I wanted to like the movie, but I couldn't because it just seemed to predictable. But the thing that annoyed me is the fact that I've seen EVERYTHING in this film done so many times better. <br /> <br />Will Smith is the same character he always plays. It's getting a little old. Kevin James is good, but he could have been better. Alot of parts in the movie consist of Kevin James being overly clumsy, and it just seems like a cop out. Amber Valletta seems like the only person taking the movie seriously, and it's refreshing to see someone who isn't acting goofy every 8 seconds. Eva Mendes is terrible. She just isn't likeable or funny. There are some actors who just aren't likeable, and I think she is one of them. <br /> <br />Aside from the actors, the script is bland and it's getting old. I'm not saying I hate romantic comedies, but this one has been done so many times. Near the end of the movie the relationships fall apart, and everyone seems to be doing their hardest to be mad at each other. I think you can guess what happens at the end.  <br /> <br />Stay away from this movie, unless you like not laughing and stupid movies.
B0007M22TI|2.0|I have watched the \\"Celtic Woman\\" DVD concert several times and I have very serious reservations about the singer's vocals actually being live. It certainly seems that they are actually lip-synching to pre-recorded tracks. Observe carefully, and you will see there are many times when the sound of the voices do not match the gesticulations of the singers' lips and mouths. This would explain the lack of animation on part of the singers, and also the artificial, melodramatic tone of their facial expressions as they 'sing'. It's a total misrepresentation, and a shame.
B0009K7QZ8|3.0|It was no secret that the second season of The O.C. was a broad, scattershot, occasionally infuriating step down in quality from the fresh and original soap update the first season of The O.C. created.  Let's count the plots that we yawned through - Marisa and the yard guy, Ryan and Lindsay, Caleb's paternity scare and Lindsay, the threat of a trial against Caleb, crazy sexpot Jess, the relationship of Ryan and his brother, and - good god - the return of Sandy's \\"true love\\" Rebecca.  Plus, Summer and Seth's antics tested the measure of patience, even as we reluctantly felt knocked down by the thought they wouldn't wind up together.  And that's not to mention too much faux-indie-music-hocking at The Bait Shop, too many unfulfilled plot ideas, and too much coy self-reference (when Seth quips \\"even The Valley was better last year!\\" you're more likely to agree than giggle).  It was all representative of a wandering sophomore season realiant on too many tricks that didn't pay off.  Still, we watched, all of us that whined our way through these 22 episodes (and occasionally, as in fully magnificent episodes like \\"Rainy Day Women,\\" we were rewarded for sticking around).  That means the OC hadn't entirely lost its addictive freshness.  Kirsten's season-capping alcoholism was a dramatic miracle by comparison to some of the season's sluggish plotlines, and Kelly Rowan deserves credit for her stunning growth as an actress.  Plus, as unconvincing Mischa Barton's performance tends to be, it was hard not to sympathize with Marisa's personal angst - the pool-furniture throwing, the lesbian fling, the attack by Trey: they added up to a shockingly compelling year for Marisa.  And as for Melinda Clarke's Julie Cooper, she was a vibrant, captivating force that turned a funny, magnificently conniving villainnes into an occasionally wowing full-bodied character with a soft streak - she's now one of the most memorable characters of all network television.  The year was without a doubt frustrating as a whole (I'm particularly unsatisfied with its Marisa's-a-murderer! finale), but it's a sign of good days to come that very few of us second-season haters plan on missing what they'll do to these kids next year.ustrating as a whole (I'm particularly unsatisfied with its Marisa's-a-murderer! finale), but it's a sign of good days to come that very few of us second-season haters plan on missing what they'll do to these kids next year.

I've watched this film probably 20 times and I never get tired of the whole integration, it's just magnificent! Welles was simply FANTASTIC in his role, a genius in the medium, and in my book he will always stand alone as the pinnacle of what is possible in great film.

This book opens with Joel Backman, the man who was the man to see in D.C. already a crook and already in in prison. When Backman is offered a pardon in the final hours of a failed presidency he takes it, unaware that he is to be human bait to draw out hit teams from various friendly and not-so-friendly countries.    Backman is exiled to Europe where his very isolation causes him to suspect his freedom may be illusory, Part chase, part Spy vs. Spy, this is s very satisfying book.

Considering the variability encountered when engaging each prospect or customer, that would be of little value.  The value of this book is in describing the bigger picture. Neil takes a refreshingly different approach by describing a (high level) process that research has shown to be successful in larger sales.  No doubt about it, the SPIN process will improve you chance of winning, but only if used in conjunction with your own knowledge and instinct (Neil says this much in the book). The SPIN process is meant to be melded with the specific best practices of your business, industry, etc.  When these best practices are modeled using the SPIN methodology, great things happen.      Plan your sales calls around this methodology.  But as Neil points out, don't be dogmatic with it.  While SPIN is a process that has been scientifically shown to be successful, use SPIN to guide your instinct, not replace it.

The overall feel of the movie is very dark and creepy and it may be unapealing to some people.  The acing is top notch, Bale owned this role and even lost 60 pounds to play the part.  This film is a great  <br />psychological thriller that will keep you wanting more throughout the entire movie.

The plot is generally cliche, and the book is written at a third or fourth grade level, which, considering the age of the characters, can almost be insulting. I just graduated high school, and I whisked through this book in an hour. If you want something that'll last you a while and cure your boredom, this book isn't it. One thing that I did like in the book, however, is the relationship and issues between the main character and his friends, as well as the addressing of bisexuality. Those are the high points of the novel, however, as the main romantic plot is predictable, and I've seen this kind of character growth and development a thousand times before.
