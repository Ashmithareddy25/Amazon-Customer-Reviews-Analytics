B0099TJ4YQ|4.0|~ A Christmas album seems like a natural for James Taylor's voice and style.  This pleasant Christmas CD merges Taylor's folk-pop sensibility with David Grusin's contemporary jazz arrangements and an eclectic selection of songs.  The result may not be the perfect Christmas CD, but it is well above average; especially when you compare it to so many over-produced, schmaltzy Christmas albums pumped out by pop stars.<br />~ This CD is in part a re-release of his 2004 [[ASIN:B00078V7AW A Christmas Album]] using 10 of the 11 songs from that CD (\\"Deck the Halls\\" is omitted for some reason) plus 4 additional tracks - one each from 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2012.<br />~ James Taylor fans will be pleased hearing his warm, friendly voice and distinctive vocal style, which is well suited to most of the material.<br />~ Depending on your own personal tastes, you may find different highlights than I did, but for me the highlights are:<br />- instrumental backing and solos by Chris Botti (trumpet), Toots Theilemans (harmonica), David Grusin (piano), and especially the jazz guitar playing of John Pizzarelli as well as Taylor's own folk guitar playing.<br />- fine, mellow treatments of \\"Winter Wonderland\\", \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\", \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\", \\"Some Children See Him\\", \\"The Christmas Song\\", \\"Who Comes This Night\\", \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\", and \\"Auld Lang Syne\\".<br />- not all of the songs work for me.  Taylor's interpretation of Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" pales in comparison to the original or even Holy Cole's haunting rendition on [[ASIN:B000005H9X Dark Dear Heart]].  His duet with Natalie Cole on \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" does not measure up to several other versions out there; most notably the Lou Rawls - Diane Reeves version on [[ASIN:B000005GZQ Jazz to the World]].  The bluesy version of \\"Jingle Bells\\", which completely recasts the melody, is odd and takes a little getting used to.<br />~ Overall, a recommended 'above average' Christmas CD.  So grab some eggnog, light the fireplace, sit back and enjoy.me eggnog, light the fireplace, sit back and enjoy.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|What can you say about Jesse Cook's recordings after you say they are great? The elegance and talent this man has is unsurpassed. Even if you don't really like flamenco style playing, try this and your mind will be changed. This particular CD is indeed 'ultimate&#34;. Not a bad track on it.
0393317552|4.0|While some have criticized this book as placing too much emphasis on geography and technology as deterministic forces (as &#34;Fates&#34; suggests in the subtitle), I found Diamond's evidence and argument to be valid: technology and geography have played a role in how different societies developed, and as a result, there were consequences when these societies met and clashed. Very much worth the read.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|This movie is not boring at all. It's exciting and thrilling from very early on and continues to hold interest. However I was disappointed in the wolves! They could have done a much better job making the wolves look realistic! Bottom line: It's a great thriller movie and Liam Neeson does a superb job as always! :)
0451169514|5.0|I have to think my most favorite place in the world to read about is Derry in the mid to late 50's. Bev and Richie have to be may favorites and maybe its because they cross over in 11/22/63 or maybe because seem to have so much life in these books. Do not get me wrong Bill is the main character and he is so well written you feel like a ghost shadowing him every where he goes. But as a whole I fell in love with Bev and Richie.  I gave this book away after I finished it because I wanted to share the story with a friend. I feel like it may have been a mistake because I so want to go back to Derry.
B006ZZANFG|5.0|I believe This Album to be by far her best ever: the Gold Album which is a 2 Cd/DVD set of one of her concerts Nights from the Alhambra filmed live in Granada Spain in 2006 (wonder if this was her comeback album)hum? I would rate by far as her best album ever because you get to see a complete concert recorded live (19 pieces) I prefer watching the DVD with the commentary I have yet to listen to the CD's! prefering to slump in my couch with my feet up and have watched it over and over and over again and have never tired of it. Of course not on the same day!I really wish she would make more albums like this, there is nothing like seeing her (almost) Live since I will probably never ever see her live in Canada, or Europe they are far away, and doubt she would ever play anywhere in the southern United States. Here she has presented her best music it is worth every penny. I understand her work is not for everyone but then again neither is heavy metal, or ballet. I purchased one and sent it to a friend as a gift. I have 9 of her albums, all of her music and can tell you this is her definitive album senna qua none You see all the exotic instruments, Mckennitt's Skilled harpestry, her spectacular voice, she also is a pianist and plays the accordion switching through out from one to the other with ease, I always listen to the concert with the commentary it is just beautiful. Buy this album and you will not be disappointed.

1936608618|5.0|As a former collegiate athlete I wish this book had been available for the coaches and myself to utilize during my playing days. There was always certain movements I struggled with and I never quite knew how to correct them. In reading this book I was able to identify some key areas of weakness and ways in which to correct them. The book has great illustrations to aid people and get them headed in the right direction. There is endless information and it will suck you in as its an interesting and easy read. I will be encouraging fellow athletes and coaches to obtain a copy asap so they can train better and coach better!
B006ATJXQW|3.0|This novel is the prequel to the amazing Maze Runner series. I was a bit unsatisfied with it although that's not to say it wasn't a good book. First while this may be the prequel to the series, we see little of the original series in here. We're introduced to a new set of characters in the world right before all of the events of the Maze Runner series occurs. Mark is a brave character who is just trying to survive the world after the sun flares. Trina is just as strong as Mark in certain aspects but she also relies on him a lot to help her survive. This story centers around these two characters and their experience as the world goes from tragedy to madness. It's interesting to see how the virus comes to be although there are still quite a few unanswered questions. There is a lot of action and the story is very fast-paced so there is no lack of excitement. However, it really isn't what was expected for a prequel and really doesn't come to a satisfying conclusion. I would recommend you give this book a shot if you've read the Maze Runner series just to get the complete story. If you haven't read the Maze Runner Series you can read this book first then pick up the rest.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This movie ruined Abraham Lincoln for me in the best way possible. I can not see a Lincoln movie now with out expecting him to start slinging his ax and lopping off heads. Every single other Lincoln movie is forever doomed because of this.

B009HEJXFS|5.0|I loved this movie. It was a great fir with the trilogy. I laughed frequently through out this movie and at points I almost cried. The twists in the film are not ones you can see coming and I love that about a movie. Loved the picture of Frank. I think he was the best dog ever in a movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it cant put my kindle down even my kids want to play it good graphics abd very easy to play
B00A77II0U|5.0|Fun story, great graphics, easy accessable strategy guide, not hard to play or figure out. Runs well on Kindle Fire. I would love to see more like this.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Blackheart is worth the price of the entire album all by itself. I've listened to that one song more than 70 times in the past couple weeks and have not gotten tired of it. Simply beautiful.<br /><br />Other tracks are fantastic as well. SkyWorld, El Dorado, Winterspell, Big Sky, and Queen of Crows, to name a few. This is my favorite album from TSFH so far, and I like that they somewhat departed from their earlier style. There is more lyricism, more classical influence (as well as a few instances of very modern electronica, a very interesting combination.)
B003IDMUWC|4.0|The story of Jake Brigance, a lawyer in small town Mississippi, is John Grisham's first, hirst first venture into the arena of professional storytelling, the vehicle that turned him into a big-league player in that very arena where few succeed, but those who do, often do so wildly; they get to play among the stars; they become one.<br />  Grisham describes, in a note to the edition I read (2009), how it was to peddle a good book on the back of a popular one (The Firm) and a slew of bestsellers that followed with the result that \\"a good life became even better\\".<br />  A Time To Kill is Grisham's best, by far, and he is the first to admit it. He laments the loss of Ford County and wishes he was back. He'd do well to take himself seriously and visit back, perhaps to stay. There's lots more there and he can, by his own account, afford it now. He has shown us that the proverbial grass is is not always greener on the other side. Sometimes there really isn't any grass at all.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is much more than a dictionary.<br />It is a great source of information and expands ones vocabulary quickly.<br />I recommend it for anyone wanting to expand his general knowledge, too.
B009NCM248|5.0|This album is my favorite one from Stone Sour yet! There aren't any songs that I can't jam out to, the ballads are great, and for the price I got it at, there's no excuse not to buy the whole thing!
B000HKW7E0|2.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years and thought watch it again this year.  It truly has been a LONG time since I've seen this  because I don't remember there being so much language. Definitely not a movie to watch as a family...i.e. not for little ears at all! Just a little heads-up. I would have given this five stars but the language brought it down to a two...it's hard to appreciate this as an adult and parent. It would have been just as hilarious if they had left certain expletives out. Just sayin'.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A cast of great actors.  It's just a pleasure to watch them interact. You smile when the movie is over.
B003O86FMW|5.0|...well, all I can say is that I HUNGER for the next book in the series. What next?!!!! What ending is in store?
B009HEJXFS|1.0|this movie was a big yawn.  nothing new:  fight aliens, chase aliens, catch aliens, save the world.  dont even bother.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This book had potential, but it just didn't happen. There was way too much back & forth...we are together, now we aren't together, now we are, and on & on. As immature as the 2 main characters were, the ending just didnt make sense. AND if I had to read the words pigeon or pidge again, I seriously would have thrown up.

0812415027|1.0|Very disappointed this product is shown as a hardcover.  And it is, but it is a paper back put in a hardcover.
B008PNBU30|3.0|I've listened to this album for about a week or so but I ended playing their other albums after listening to this.  I'm glad Three Days Grace decided to experiment a bit on this album but the songs just don't come off as memorable as songs on previous albums.  The album starts off strong right off the bat with \\"Sign of the Times\\". The tranquil minute introduction leaves you in a state of eagerness of when the guitars are going erupt and Adam's aggressive vocals are going to burst out.  They definitely do kick in and get your adrenaline pumping.  The song also sounds like nothing they've done before.  Next is \\"Chalk Outline\\" which we all know.  Aside from the cheesy lyrics, it was a good choice as a first single.  It still sounded like Three Days Grace while incorporating the electronic elements during the verses.  Then comes \\"The High Road\\" a ballad-like track that pales in comparison to previous ballad-like tracks like \\"Never Too Late\\" or \\"World So Cold\\".  It just comes off as way too simple.  When \\"Operate\\" comes in I think of a downgraded version of \\"Break\\" from their previous album.  Nothing to rave about.  The album picks back up with \\"Anonymous\\" which has some of the best lyrics on the album compared to many of the other songs.  Nice verses and a catchy chorus that will get stuck in your head.  The album turns more on the downside with \\"Misery Loves Company\\".  I don't have a problem with song lengths but this song ends before you know it.  Like \\"Operate\\", does this not sound like a downgraded version of \\"Time of Dying\\" from One-X?  Don't get me started with the Michael Jackson cover of \\"Give In to Me\\".  I don't mind covers but compared to the epic-ness of the Slash solos in the original version, this comes off very generic.  The album seems to pick up a little bit with \\"Happiness\\" which sounds like a straightforward Three Days Grace song.  However, what makes this song stand out is the tempo changes throughout.  Although, like \\"Chalk Outline\\", the lyrics in the chorus are just corny and could be written by a ten year old.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was a single.  After this track, the album takes off to its ultimate height with the next two tracks \\"Give Me a Reason\\" and \\"Time That Remains\\".  Both are two of the best songs on the album with the latter being best regardless of being the softest on the album.  Good lyrics and memorable melodies thoughout a peaceful more acoustic track.  The next track \\"Expectations\\" is nothing special really.  The lyrics come off sounding \\"Hollywood Whore\\"-ish (Papa Roach) and aside from the opening piano keys played the song does not come off as anything memorable.  \\"Broken Glass\\" and \\"Unbreakable Heart\\" are a bit better but don't come off to be anything memorable either.  Overall, the album is good and I recommend it to Three Days Grace fans.  I applaud them for experimenting a bit but some of the songs either come off too generic whether its the song itself or the lyrics.  If you're new to Three Days Grace, then I suggest you start with their first album (my favorite).  If you enjoyed that then work your way from there because their second and third albums are good as well.<br /><br />Recommended Tracks:  \\"Sign of the Times\\", \\"Chalk Outline\\", \\"Anonymous\\", \\"Give Me a Reason\\", and \\"Time That Remains\\".

B004T4KQJS|5.0|Although a good read generally, this is more suited to someone with a science degree. I would recommend this book.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|There is not enough words in the dictionary to describe this woman.  Cd is awesome, sounds great, everything looked good and came in a timely manner. You are truly missed Ms,  Houston.
B005FI6IRG|5.0|Beautiful voices beautifully blended. Interesting selections -- some little known.  Superb agile technique but also expressiveness from both singers. Great choice!
B007REV4T8|3.0|At some point in a movie I expect to know when the story's really taking off. When I find myself a half hour in and still waiting then I smell disappointment. When I begin to doze off I wonder what I spent my ten bucks on. Skyfall is on its way to making a billion dollars, and I am happy for the franchise, but I hope we're not going to see more like it. People talk about how its more into characterization, but I really don't feel I know Bond any better after the movie than before it. We've got a completely pointless Bond Girl (pity her at future publicity gatherings-plenty O'Toole was 100 times more memorable with 1/10th the screentime). Then there's Alfred at Bond Manor, the Fleming touch of the Komodo dragons in a scene absolutely devoid of the Fleming style, and finally just a complete lack of INTRIGUE: a clever plotline and a good dose of suspense. And I never liked Judi Densch as M. From Golden Eye to Skyfall all she did was complain, criticize, and dis anything classic Bond. She even has to complain about the DB5 when Bond is protecting her (masochist that he is) in Skyfall. He really should have shot her through the roof; I would have given that a standing ovation! Instead, we must endure over two hours of waiting for her to die off. When Ralph Fiennes takes over the title and Bond walks into his office, I'm like, &#34;Yes, finally a 007 movie is starting!!!&#34; But then its over and the credits roll.
B00AEL1PWW|5.0|What a wonderful episode and clever play on words. I was tickled when Alex Kingston made the statement to Gibbs that she kept a \\"toe in the pond.\\" This reference to the part she plays in Dr Who, as River Song aka Melodie Pond. Great stuff! She will be a welcome addition to the program.
B007SGM084|4.0|The writing progresses throughout the trilogy with the first not being as well written as the last.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed the story and was glad I bought them together so I didn't have to wait to start the next one!
B004H4XLR4|5.0|Surprisingly well made character from the wildly popular (at least at my house) Cars 2 franchise. It's been dropped down the stairs, and over stuffed with a thousand matchbox cars, but it still keeps going. This one might actually outlast my kid's interest!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I use this same app on my iphone and they both work very nicely.  I recommend this app on both platforms.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This is awesome!,Great box set. Nice extras. This was a great,quirky series when it originally aired. Well done and nice extras.
B001ROZIA0|5.0|Enjoyable movie for any hopeless romantic. Great actors, wonderful theme, and reference to timeless quotes. Not to mention, beautiful dogs!
B001BANK32|5.0|Despite the fact that this was written so long ago, and many of the elements are nostalgic (party lines for one) this book still manages to make you want to turn all the lights on in the house as you settle down to read another chapter. If you're like me, and you can't put a good book down, this will be a super fast read. The characters are well developed and engaging, and you really get to caring about them. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this title.
B008478VE8|5.0|When looking back over the history of the sciences, watershed moments seem to occur with great regularity.  In reality, watershed moments are quite rare.  One of the most important watershed moments in biology was the publication of \\"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life,\\" later shortened to \\"On the Origin of Species.\\"<br /><br />While \\"On the Origin of Species\\" is the foundation and unifying theme or theory for all life sciences, it was not always that way.  Evolution had been proposed as the mechanism for how life achieved the forms known at the time, but lack of empirical evidence and conflict with the Church of England slowed widespread acceptance.  Darwin's theory provided a comprehensive explanation for how evolution worked and why it worked, describing evolution as a process of natural selection.<br /><br />Darwin's theory created significant conflict in the scientific community, and for a while, other theories of how evolution worked became more popular.  The development of population genetics in the 1920's and 1930's affirmed the validity of natural selection as the primary mechanism of evolution, and Darwin's theory was finally recognized as the most probable mechanism of evolution.<br /><br />While \\"On the Origin of Species\\" is lengthy, and detailed, it is far easier to read than I expected.  Darwin organized the chapters well and provided a brilliantly coherent explanation of possible objections to the theory of natural selection.  Darwin also thought, for reasons explained in this book, why he thought possible objections would not ultimately be sustained.  Conversely, Darwin suggested possible evidence for creationism, and explained why present evidence did not appear to support creationism.<br /><br />While Darwin had significant logical support for his theory of natural selection, he did not have the benefits of more recent biological achievement, particularly DNA.  Now that we have the ability to examine DNA, it is relatively easy to understand the relationship between many of the animals we know today.  Furthermore, while the geological record is fragmented, for reasons that Darwin explained in detail, in many case we are able to trace the origins of many modern creatures to their prehistoric beginnings.<br /><br />Darwin suggested a number of areas where he thought the theory of natural selection had potential weaknesses where additional work was required.  Much progress has been made consistent with Darwin's suggestions in this book, and the available evidence has strengthened support for Darwin's theory to the point where the theory proposed in this book is close to becoming accepted scientific fact, if it has yet to do so.<br /><br />Darwin noted in his book that there was already some empirical evidence available to support the process of natural selection.  As I noted earlier, DNA evidence in combination with time has shown biologists that animals in modern times are changing, and have continued to change due to environmental factors.  Even we are changing, though we have largely overcome most of the environmental factors that directly affect us.<br /><br />Few books exist that provide completely new and comprehensive theories in any field of science that are simultaneously readable by the average person.  This book was ground-breaking at the time, and was controversial for decades after Darwin's death, but the voluminous evidence obtain since Darwin wrote this book have caused this book to be recognized as the basis for all modern life sciences.  I think this book is phenomenally remarkable and should be required reading for all scientists and anyone trying to understanding how life as we know it came to be.  A truly amazing book, especially considering it was first published in 1859.<br /><br />Note that Amazon has combined reviews for several of the version of \\"On the Origin of Species.\\"  Examine the details of each of the versions before making your decision to buy, or not buy, since \\"On the Origin of Species\\" is available electronically in the public domain.<br /><br />Enjoy!e versions before making your decision to buy, or not buy, since \\"On the Origin of Species\\" is available electronically in the public domain.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B000ZJTPLG|2.0|I used AC30 for years, lost them, and decided to make a change and buy these.<br />Sound quality of AC30 wasn't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains, but this one has a horrendous clean (tried with my strat and tele, play jazz/blues mostly), and mediocre gain, you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers (buying a 25-35 buck connector cable), though, granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings.<br /><br />For people worried about CONSTRUCTION, these turned out to be very sturdy (AC30s i previously used did, but the built/materials are exactly same).<br />Even if you're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps, go for cheaper models, or simply buy AC30, the latter has acceptable cleans..

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This came up on my suggested list when I ordered something else I never saw it when it was on most of my tv watching by way of dvds anyway, I don't have cable long story. Well I saw this and ordered it and oh my God it was so wonderful. I don't know what it is but most shows I like are one or two season shows, Firefly, Sports Night, Dollhouse, The Greggory Hines Show (I still have that recorded on vhs) and now this one. Oh yea I forgot one Freaks and Greeks all great shows all I have on dvd and watch multiple times. My So Called Life was ahead of it's time. I can't believe that Claire was only 13 when she did what a talented lady now to see her on Homeland she is one of the greats. It's so nice to be able to watch it without the ads and all of the extra stuff just makes it that much more enjoyable. They very tastefully dealt with some heavy stuff I found myself carrying so much for these people makes you want to reach out to those around you. Amazingly real show, I'm so thankful to have it and thank you to whoever suggest these things.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|A few things that must be divulged. I had about 5000 LP's and traded in about 75% of them 15 years ago. Talk about mistakes! I have been ecstatic with the recent resurgence of vinyl, especially the quality of 180-200g pressings. But please be aware I am just a music lover; I am not an audiophile. Vinyl sounds better to my ears than any other format, but I cannot quote you my equipment specs (because they are lame) and frequency balancing mechanisms and whatever. No disrespect is intended here to other posters who document their equipment specs - I respect true audiophiles and only wish I had the $$ for that type of equipment! As I said, I just love listening to music.<br /><br />Please also be aware I did not buy the complete Box set - I bought the individual LP releases for Beatles for Sale through Past Masters (minus Yellow Sub and Let It Be). I can only offer a few humble observations on the LPs. First is that the cover reproductions are fabulous. They contain everything from the Pepper inserts to the Magical Mystery Tour booklet.  The inner sleeves all contain the plastic anti-static inside sleeve. Now about the albums.<br /><br />The albums are all pretty much flat as a pancake. Since I began re-collecting vinyl 4 years ago, I have purchased some LPs that are warped. It comes with the territory! So is this a manufacturing issue or part of the deal? I don't know. I bought a Ramones LP recently that was so warped I dared not put my tone arm on it. It could have been used as a ski slope.<br /><br />The sound? As I said, I am not an audiophile. When I first bought these albums in the 60's I played them on a crappy little turntable with a plastic tone arm and gosh knows what kind of speakers. And to my ears - they sounded fantastic! Well, these LPs still sound fantastic (I do agree with a couple of other reviews that the White Album seems to have more compression than the others - but it still sounds great!). Personally, the sound of the needle dropping to the edge before the first track, the first notes jumping out of my speakers, I am loving it. All the copies I received are noise free - no pops, hisses or scratches. They are SILENT.<br /><br />I wonder if the individual releases are a better alternative to the box (from what I've read here re. packaging issues). Personally, I don't care about a book I will look at maybe twice. It's all about the music. I am not qualified to weigh in on which master should have been used, how the sound could have been better, whatever. All I know is that I am 110% loving listening to the Beatles in glorious vinyl in stereo with spot on album sleeve replications. My ears say this is an upgrade over the CDs even if a digital source was used in these pressings. Maybe, based on folks smarter than me, an analog source would have been even better. That does not impact my thorough enjoyment of these LPs.<br /><br />ps - some reviews noted inner track distortion. I have experienced this with 2 or 3 other recent LPs I have bought. None of my Beatles LPs do this. I think my tone arm probably needs a slight adjustment. But as this only happens with a few LPs maybe it is a manufacture defect.<br /><br />Beatles and vinyl lovers - let's celebrate this!! It is awesome. Put on Sgt Pepper, hold that large LP gate fold in your hands and try to guess who is who on the cover, and above all, turn it up!before the first track, the first notes jumping out of my speakers, I am loving it.

That does not impact my thorough enjoyment of these LPs.<br /><br />ps - some reviews noted inner track distortion. I have experienced this with 2 or 3 other recent LPs I have bought. None of my Beatles LPs do this. I think my tone arm probably needs a slight adjustment. But as this only happens with a few LPs maybe it is a manufacture defect.<br /><br />Beatles and vinyl lovers - let's celebrate this!! It is awesome. Put on Sgt Pepper, hold that large LP gate fold in your hands and try to guess who is who on the cover, and above all, turn it up!
0694003611|5.0|The rhythm of the words are very lovely and suitable for bedtime! The pictures are cute and one thing I love most is that the pages getting darker towards the end - meaning we are going to bed! I did fall asleep the first time I read it too. :)) Great bedtime story!
B004SDEP38|1.0|A trial version that won't allow you to do anything but read. You can get free apps just as good that'll allow you to do anything including create. I had this app on my Palm Pilots and the key codes don't work on it, either so forget that.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Not always a big fan of Stephen King, but this was excellent.  Having lived through the events and also having read some of the conspiracy theories, this book was fascinating.  Highly recommend!
B00013M6NK|1.0|Battery does not work - worst Nikon battery I've ever had if it is a &#34;genuine&#34; Nikon.  Put in camera - showed it was dead.  I charged it fully.  When I turned camera on I took 2 pictures - viewed them & it was dead again.  Tried to charge again & it simply will not work.
B004IFD9HE|5.0|This movie is fun for the entire family and is not stupid silly like some other Adam Sandler movies are.
B000VECAC6|5.0|It took me a while to figure out how to get to the menu, but the film was clear, the subtitles (which is the reason I got it) were nice, and the interviews with the Pythons was worth the price of the whole thing.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a classic movie that my family has to see at Christmas time.  This movie has it all, even a squirrel to brighten your day.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Highly entertaining with plenty of scifi and fantasy action and just enough cheek to make it smart, funny, and hip.  Another winner from Joss Whedon.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|Usually something like this turns out cheezy, but not this time. I liked all the actors. They made it exciting and fun. I give them an A on this one.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Live on Mitch Rapp!  I could not put down The Last Man - on the edge of my chair from page to page!
B004RC8NUQ|3.0|This movie was really funny and great...until I watched Friends With Benefits, which was much funnier and just over all better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app the haters are stupidly stupider than me and I'm stupid bye this app and prove them wrong and its addicting but of u wanted to get off you could its not that addictive
B0078JRFZE|5.0|What a WONDERFUL series thus far.  Well written; acted and produced, I find myself immersed in each episode.  Haven't felt this way since Knots Landing here in the states (not that I'm proud to say that-lol).
B009SJ3H8Q|2.0|CONTAINS SOME MINOR SPOILERS.<br /><br />The first few episodes of season 2 were really compelling -- Jessica Lange was given another meaty role that she could really sink her teeth into, and the asylum was suitably creepy and menacing with a great assortment of inmates and disturbed staff. The story also managed to weave thoughtful 60s political and social commentary in with the scares, which gave the show some additional gravity.<br /><br />Unfortunately the story became over-burdened fairly quickly with too many plot threads (Nazis and mutant medical experiments, deomonic possession, aliens AND serial killers? Really?); but the writers also disappointingly began including constant gross-out elements and torture porn scenes. As an example, what started-out as a thoughtful commentary about the nation's attitudes toward gays and lesbians in the 60s turned into a graphic and exploitative forced masturbation \\"deviance cure\\" scene in a later epioside.<br /><br />I seem to be in the minority of my friends in thinking that this season isn't watchable due to the extreme emphasis on torture and gore, but if like me you prefer the more nuanced approach of the first season to the \\"Hostel\\" or \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" style focus on degradation and suffering, then you might want to avoid this season.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Great movie for guys and gals! I started watching the movie, while my boyfriend was on the computer in the same room, with in 15 minutes...my boyfriend and his brother were watching it with me and love the humor in it.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|this is an ok game. just don't get suckered into buying gems. you can play just fine without them and still move up in levels
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Great for on the go and easy to use.  Nice to have when that auction you are waiting on is in the last moments.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|It brought back fond memories of my own early years  The film captures the innocence of the '60's era perfectly, blending  humor (I laughed all the way through it) with dysfunctional family problems and the magic of falling in love for the first time.
B004529NKM|5.0|I absolute love all of the Step Up movies. The characters are absolutely gorgeous, the acting is good, and who does love dancing!
B007REV4YI|2.0|First, let me say that I've been a fan of James Bond films since the Roger Moore era.  Those films were chalk full of wit and charm, complete with spectacular stuntwork.  Who can forget Roger Moore skiing off a cliff prior to one of the opening montages?  I also enjoyed Timothy Dalton as 007, Pierce Brosnan who probably comes in third place and Sean Connery for nostalgia, in last.  Films aside, for who embodied Bond the most, I'd probably say Timothy Dalton or Sean Connery had the whole package.  Brosnan was a little too pretty and Moore a little too unbelievable/goofy.<br /><br />Daniel Craig's portrayal of the debonair super spy has physicality but zero flair.  Craig has no wit and moreso than this, is not that attractive to look at.  Because he looks like a rogue, they have to dress him in very modern Tom Ford suits vs. the tailor-made classic Brioni that Brosnan wore.  This is a let down to the series.  He also sports a black cord to his ear like a soldier on a Black-Ops training mission.  Bond is supposed to fight to the beat his own drum, not take orders from superiors through an earpiece!  What has happened to the franchise?<br /><br />This film had zero spectacular stunts, zero gadgets and Bond girls with little to no screentime.  Everything that you'd expect from a Bond film was totally missing.  There has to be a happy medium from the overtly CGI-laden Die Another Day with it's cheap gimmicks like the \\"invisible\\" Aston Martin to this film.  I understand that the producers want a more realistic and perhaps grittier film but in all honesty, this film loses the fun factor.  It has been said that this film had 500 shots that were CGI based which places it second behind Die Another Day.<br /><br />It also should be noted that the director, Sam Mendes, took inspiration from the Dark Knight trilogy with this film.  The similarities are astounding and furthermore reinforce that this movie is garbage.  The title itself isn't even from an Ian Fleming novel which issurprising to say the least.  Daniel Craig has said that he wants out of making Bond movies and this sentiment translates on screen.  Berenice Marloh (Severine) even said Craig wouldn't even take off his underpants for the shower scene.  Is he gay?<br /><br />It seems as though the producers of the film invested their money in the cinematography versus stuntmen and elaborate action setpieces.  The ending at Bond's lodge, SkyFall felt like it was out of a Van Damne movie complete with floorboards booby-trapped with shotgun shells.  What happened to Bond infiltrating the villain's lair?  There were even corny references to past Bond films with the reintroduction of the DB5 from the Sean Connery days.<br /><br />I can't say how I wish I waited until this movie came out on Blu-Ray.  I saw it for $20 in IMAX on a BAD blind date and I wish I had saved my money.  I think with the 50th Anniversary, this film is a \\"reboot\\" of sorts.  Let's hope that what we've come to expect from a James Bond film gets reinstalled for the next outing set for release in a couple more years.  Unfortunately, Craig will still be at the helm!
B007SY3CEW|5.0|He loves using it and now he wants piano lessons!  The songs selections were fantastic and he plays for long stretches.
B00782O7IY|5.0|I didn't think I'd like a silent film, but &#34;The Artist&#34; lived up to its glowing reviews and fully deserved the Oscar for best movie of 2011.
B007JNR4XW|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. One of my favorites is Save the Last Dance and this movie is just as amazing. The story is real and the characters are very believable. If you are a dancer or love dancing this movie is definitely for you!!
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Love the guitar and the various moods of the songs...it is truly a rally good soundtrack and I painted a mostowerfuo painting to its music!
B009B0L324|5.0|An excellent release! I have the DVD & have been waiting for this CD ever sine I got the DVD. I listen to Live at Donnington all the time. This one is now is in heavy rotation on my list too! Great mix of older & newer material.
B00136NWLE|5.0|I originally bought this album as an 8 track tape in 1976. It was great then and it still holds up 35 years later!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|One of the most cutest movies every! Great story and the characters are absolutely adorable. Watching the MINI movies is a must!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Purchased this book due to the reviews and low cost and I was not disappointed. The story left me longing to be dear friends of the two main characters.
0307719219|5.0|For anyone who is trying to understand economic history or how to understand why some countries have done well while other countries continue to struggle with global capitalism.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, especially the animals and their interaction in unusual circumstances. I enjoyed experiencing the active imagination of the author. But it did seem like it took way too long to reach the conclusion.
B0017TWUZG|5.0|Awesome Movie! Having it on Blue Ray makes it even better. Great movie for any person who loves dancing and hip hop.
B007MDB71O|5.0|One of best sci-fi movie .<br />Awesome Special Effect .<br />Good movie for all ages<br />Good acting.Beautiful scenery and landscape of Barsoom.<br />I became a fan of the director A.S after watched this movie.<br />I purchased this movie Blu-ray/ DVD combo at the cheapest price on black friday in USA on amazon.com
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We just started watching this series recently and we didn't have the first episode of the new season, so we rented it from Amazon.  It was very convenient. It is a good family show to watch.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love it its a great and fun game though it sometimes glitches on me but otherwise its great and fun to play.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was so good.  It did how ever skip around a lot but other than that the story line is awesome!  I recommend this book to all my friends!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of the best action movies EVER produced! Highly recommend!!! This is a movie everyone can enjoy - action humor - 5 GOLD STARS!!!
B003ASLJK4|5.0|... this movie never gets old. It's a timeless classic that you'll watch in passing via the television or DVD & realize, it's like watching for the very first time. Even the soundtrack is a wonderful work of art & after 17 years of randomly watching this movie, I thought there was no chance I'd cry (yet again) during the scene \\"This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime ... \\" I realized it was impossible. What a great movie. This is a must see. A must have. A classic forever ... ♥
B008MM9630|4.0|I love fairy farm but I don't like how the animals cost a lot of diamonds and you don't earn them fast and they cost money.... cant finish challenges because of it!
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Libertus is one of my picks for best episode of television in 2012 but really it ranks up in the best of ever for me.  The actors and crew have really gone all out and the writing is top notch. You will not be disappointed!
B007HACDLK|5.0|The only negative I would have on this whole series of Mitch Rapp books is that I have to now wait another year for the next one.  Once I begin reading the book, it's done within a day, it is that good.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great read! Really enjoyed the book. Story line is different from 50 Shades of Grey but thoroughly the ride with Gideon and Eva.
0316069434|2.0|Like some others I was already excited about the return of dirty Harry Bosch.  Connelly has a pretty awesome track record with him.  Still, as other readers have indicated, the Bosch material seems too tired and uninspired now.  Other writers have managed to keep their crime-buster protagonists fairly fresh, even after numerous installments, but M.C. seems to have slipped up a bit here, in my view.<br />Pursuit of the killer[s] of a rather uninteresting foreign victim in a cold, VERY cold case<br />isn't much of a hook to get us interested.  Background of the victim [very] slowly unpacked by Bosch has no energy at all.  Who cares? We readers do. The ending is as good as dead by the time one gets to it.<br />Andrew Gross, James Patterson, and James Lee Burke do it all much better for sure.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I really was hoping for more special features, meaning that they could have put each of the actor's &#34;theme&#34; dance could have been included. What is included is fun and the movie is very enjoyable, I just wanted more.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Highly addictive, Its good, god its good. Start it and you can'y put it down.Why is this review thing word sensitive and not letter s

B009VB97EY|5.0|I really wish he would do dance in films as often as he can.  With or without clothes, it is such a treat to watch him dance.  So talented.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Say anything you wish--you can't beat such an outrageous Title as this! Pure Escapism-Fantasy and I say bring it on! What a marvelous way to symbolize one of our Greatest Presidents! Lincoln always represented the best in our Presidents and for him to take on evil such as vampires is sheer genius. Amazing noone thought of this decades ago. Sure to be an \\"Instant CULT CLASSIC\\"!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|this game does not give any useful hints, it does not include half of the objects needed. This is a horrible game that I will never play again in mu entire life. I wish I would have given it a 0.
0316228532|1.0|This novel is so dreary, depressing and hopeless.  The multitude of characters are almost all unlikeable and not well-developed, the tone cynical. Rather shocking, considering how good the character development was in the HP series.  The HP characters seemed like real people to me, but these characters are cardboard caricatures.  I came away with nothing of value.  This book is not worth the time it takes to read it.  Very disappointing.
B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|Excellent read for those with a reasonable background in bio science.  The book opens a new world of possibilities for research into the epigenetic links to behavior, health and well-being.  I would have liked to have seen more discussion on &#34;how&#34; the patterns already imprinted on the subconscious mind can actually be changed, rather than simply stating that they can be changed.  Highly recommend this book to those with an open mind and a desire to understand the way the body &#34;really&#34; works!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|this works great for me, and I love having an extra 5 Gb of space.  As a photo viewing program it works better  and is stable, unlike other apps.

B0082A3HTQ|2.0|this soundtrack  looks like a illegal copy , i mean the package  ,  just one piece of paper , i have made a wrong choice to bought this soundtrack because of the  movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A very easy read, yet riveting in presentation! I come from a militry background and it was refreshing to see the story told without the &#34;Hollywood&#34; flare and unrealistic bravado.  The Spec Ops warriors are different breed of soldier, and it was exciting to see that point of view expressed so honestly and respectfully. Once you start reading this account, you won't want to put it down!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|If you enjoy games of any kind, this is a mst have for you. There is not only a challange in each of the 101 games, but there are added challanges thrown in thru out the game. It's fun when you only have a couple of minutes to play and fast paced and challanging enough to keep you playing when you have lot's of time.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it is a great game. really fun .just wish you could upgrade it yae yae yea yea yea yea yea yea

B007TNQ7EY|2.0|it uses so much memory that you would literally need to reset your kindle fire to factory defaults to play it. I would not do this if I were you.
0060090367|3.0|Generally I don't care much for this kind of story. It had a clingy feel. Like the main character was basing too much of her need for support in a dependent manner. But I did feel like it was written in a fresh way and I didn't feel it was a waste of my time. I read the whole thing even though I didn't care for the whole premise of the story.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I mean this movie didn't really have a good storyline, but those BODIES were just amazing!!  Great gift for my sister :D
B006LSZECO|3.0|Our book club decided that we should read it. I am almost finished but in my opinion it is such a downer so far. That man is a jerk and his wife is far from perfect although her parents thought that she was. How could people be so dumb???
B0073LWEXK|3.0|ummm its okay but the downloading takes forever  its not worth paying but if free then get it  the graphics are super cool!!
B00979CS50|2.0|Wow, what a disappointment this was. I am a NY fan (w/CSN, CH, solo, etc.), I truly am. Two of my personal Top 20 are \\"Cortez the Killer\\" and \\"Down by the River\\" so please don't think I am just an unaware old fart.<br /><br />I don't honestly know what my expectations were for this release, but whatever they were this didn't even come close. Best description I can give is \\"self-indulgent crap\\" that mostly qualifies as noise. LONG noise. Really?!? Songs that last 20 minutes or more with no discernable progress or improvement, like the will-it-ever-end?!? \\"Driftin' Back\\" are a waste of time and storage space. Forget the money I spent on this release - that's almost 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back!!!<br /><br />Worse, this did NOT need to be two discs for cryin' out loud! Shorten some of it and cut out the crap and one disc is plenty. One decent song on the first disc (\\"Ramada Inn\\"; definitely NOT the title track) and one decent song on the second (\\"Walk Like a Giant\\"; definitely NOT the \\"bonus\\" alternate mix of the title track; a bonus - REALLY?!?).  Two songs - that's all I get out of this mess.<br /><br />So, was this supposed to be artsy? Is there something I'm missing WRT the whole Crazy Horse thing and sounding like a grunge band? If so, my bad - should've never bought this. A friend knowledgeable (and talented in) music thought I would like it, but I suspect he thought I knew what CH was about. I did too - BIG mistake on my part. Won't happen again.<br /><br />If Neil is listening: Fire the sound engineers that are associated with this release. The sound quality sucks. If recorded in a garage, it sounds about right; if in studio, they should be fired for cause and arrested for committing fraud on consumers.<br /><br />Just sayin' . . .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautifully written. I feel in love with this book, the characters, the love, the heartache. All of it is beautiful. I wish the book was longer!!!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|All three books are so frustating, so repetitive, the same phrases over and over again, the story was regular but the way it was told gets really boring after a while, the sex scenes boring and repetitive as well, it would be fun if someone actually count the number of times that you find &#34;Oh my&#34; &#34;Christian please&#34; how many times she Gasps, how many times he says &#34;Don't bite your lip&#34; or his mouth transforming into a thin line and how many times he passes a hand through his hair, oh and all the &#34;Mr. Grey and Ms. Steele&#34; back and forth is soooo annoying! who does that?! I mean, can't you just call yourselves by first name?? Anyways, as I said, the story was regular but I was left with a very bad taste after I finished my reading.

B009KKLQKO|3.0|Many long-time die-hard Beach Boys fans like me who attended one or more concerts on the 50th Anniversary Tour have already weighed in here about this just-released DVD version and frankly, I'm puzzled by the overwhelmingly positive reviews that many have given it. Are they really talking about the same DVD that I have?  Really? If so, I'm truly confused. The version I have is virtually unwatchable due to the the choppy, jittery video effect used throughout the entire concert. I thought maybe I just had a defective copy, but other reviewers here have also noted this bizarre decision to use a stock video production effect, usually used only sparingly to add brief moments of visual variety to long concert recordings, throughout this entire DVD. After watching the effect for a few minutes, praying it would stop but it never does, I began to suspect that Brian was playing a huge joke on us by having the DVD cases of all copies dusted with his favorite brand of acid that would be absorbed into our fingertips as we eagerly ripped open the packaging to get to the disc and provide a pleasant hallucinogenic aid for viewing the DVD. To the casual Beach Boy fan, this would seem like a totally unbelievable explanation for this bad video trip, but given the Beach Boy's long, surreal history, we true fans know that anything's possibe, right people? Another potential scenario (again, only in the bizarro Beach Boy world) might be that in order to save production costs and grind out .01% more profit, ever-thrifty Mike Love attempted to master this disc himself on his laptop with Windows DVD Maker (Apple products being too expensive) and totally botched it. The real reason I suspect this jumpy effect was used is actually more pragmatic: to purposely divert visual attention from the extensive vocal overdubbing employed throughout the entire concert recording. Specifically I'm referring to most of Mike Love's lead vocals, where for almost two hours, lips and lyrics rarely meet. I understand that it's common practice to \\"sweeten\\" the audio in live concert recordings with occasional overdubs recorded later in the studio, but this 50th Anniversary Tour DVD is essentially a video version of the Beach Boys' rare 1968 \\"Stacks-O-Tracks\\" LP which featured only background vocals to fifteen Beach Boy songs. In this case, Mike's shaky live lead vocals were often scrubbed and studio versions dubbed over the group's live backgrounds, with a video chop effect added to disguise poor audio/video sync-up. Add all this to the 20+ songs on the concert set list missing from the DVD and presto, another shoddy and disappointing Beach Boys video product(e.g., \\"Doin'It Again\\", \\"Nashville Sounds\\", etc.) compared to the fulfilling and rewarding experience it could have been (e.g.\\"Endless Harmony\\", \\"Live At Knebworth\\" and all Brian Wilson solo video projects).<br /><br />With all that said, are there enough magical musical moments in this DVD to make up for these technical shortcomings?  Will you be glad to have this choppy, overdubbed, set-list-half-empty DVD souvenir of undoubtedly the last time all surviving Beach Boys will take the stage together versus no DVD at all? Should you buy a copy, even if you're just a casual Beach Boys fan? Yes, Yes and Yes. If you are a real Beach Boys fan, you already know that disappointment comes with the territory: lawsuits, drugs, mental illness, death and worst of all --- some really, really bad creative ideas (e.g., M.I.U., disco-\\"Here Comes The Night\\",etc.) Yet through it all, it all comes down to the music --- that special kind of music only the Beach Boys could make for the past 50 years. Even in the very worst Beach Boys projects (pick one: \\"Keepin' The Summer Alive\\", \\"Stars & Stripes\\", the L.A.Light Album, \\"15 Big Ones\\", etc.) there will be at least one or two moments of magical harmony that will make the purchase worthwhile and that you'll add to your own personal \\"Beach Boy's Greatest Hits\\" album. But, time is running out andwho knows how many more of those moments there'll be?  All the more reason to appreciate whatever Brian, Mike, Al & Bruce want to give us while they're still with us --- while at the same time, letting them know we expect better of them than this.
B005XN2ZUC|5.0|Imaginative, clever, entertaining and addicting. I cant believe this is a network show! Shows this good are usually on paid cable.  'Once' has it all; drama , action, romance, imagination, comedy, heros and villians. Check it out, you'll be hooked!
B007PBKG5G|4.0|The Album was much like seeing them in concert at the virgin music festival. Surprisingly good but there is the little thing of the recorded distortion that others have noted as well. I went as far as to download another MP3 file. Same thing. oh well. Guess either have to learn to live with it or skip ahead when it starts. If you like blues type of rock then you will like this album.

0316228532|4.0|This is a fairly dark work.  That is not to say that HP was not dark too but the fantasy in it was so entertaining that the darkness was more palatable.  This is very well written and is about the adults and the children of a small town in England who are thrown into control and class issues when one of the local politicians dies suddenly.  This is a town which was once all prosperously middle class or better but due to a political deal annexed some other territory which brought in lower classes. Those two classes are thrown together in this book, both teenagers and adults.<br /><br />Here's why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5: I think this author has the talent to have handled this like the classic Mapp and Lucia series by Benson, which contained some similar, but not quite so dark, material but such material was handled by Benson with absolutely brilliant wit. This story has some of that wit but pulls well short of full delivery. I almost gave up reading this when we had a lengthy home visit by a social worker to a lower class single mother and her sodden child.  This material was just depressing.  But it followed on the heels of some trenchant observations of all the townspeople sharing their views over the just dead fellow.  That was remarkably like reading Mapp & Lucia and I loved it. I also loved reading with \\"Fats\\" (because he is skinny) copes with having a father in administration and his mother as guidance counselor in the school were he too is stuck for the duration of his adolescence.  Finding out why the students call his father \\"Cubby\\" and hearing Cubby sob during an assembly over the decedent, reminded me of that other force of British wit, Wodehouse.<br /><br />But you can't mistake Rowling's talent.  She knows how to tell a story and this story was something she wanted to write about thoroughly.  That not all of us will be as smitten with these characters as she is probably does not concern her.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B009HV2JT8|4.0|&#34;Abraham Lincoln:  Vampire Hunter&#34; is an &#34;okay&#34; movie, but what gives it that extra star for me is the use of historical fiction in combination with the vampire genre.  The plot is not the deepest, but it's deep enough, and the action and special effects make for a movie worth renting.
1582701709|5.0|this book has build of my confidence and was given me proven results. it has lots of illustrations and examples of people who has applied the techniques mentioned. the techniques are simple and very easy to apply.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I found that like all of Vince Flynn's books I couldn't put it down.  I am a big fan and can't wait for more.<br />I have read every one of his books and shared them and given them as presents.
B00671A9RK|5.0|It's a book which needs to be read in different time of life, all the times it gives you different sensations
B006VFLIYK|2.0|My how he goes on and on!  More than half way through I began to consider jumping to the end or just finding another book!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this movie had to have a copy of my own............It was in very good shape and boxed. Very affordable.
B00447G2PM|5.0|This movie is great.  I love to see the ocean.  It was so clear in the movie.  My kids like it too.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|very interesting story, very well written. Never boring, get you stuck till the end of the story. I suggest to everyone is curious how special forces job
B009KKLQVS|2.0|A second underwhelming DVD/Bluray release for the Beach Boys' 50th anniversary shows in a row.<br /><br />The 20+ performances missing I can deal with. They played 47 songs live (including the two encores), and the home video only features 21 of them.<br /><br />Seeing the actual show in person (at the Bangor Waterfront on June 22nd, 2012) I can confirm that what you see on this video is exactly what we saw.<br /><br />But the framerate is so AWFUL I am not even sure if I can watch this. Right from the beginning the entire show has this affect where it's like half of the frames are removed.<br /><br />Anything moving at a fast speed (like drummer John Cowsill's arms) look like a blur, and it drops so many frames that everyone looks like they are lip synching.<br /><br />I should note this is not a hardware issue. The dropped frames are a video effect that is often used by other bands for a tiny PART of a concert video (to cover up a mistake, or as an artistic effect) but not during the ENTIRE show. It's really awful to watch and I am so disappointed.<br /><br />The main menu screen doesn't even have a Chapter Select where you could skip directly to a performance.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this video, and the sad part is some of this live footage appears on their 'Doin' It Again' home video (released 3 months earlier), and that footage is less processed, doesn't have the framerate issues, looks more real, and watchable.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:B008KZY01C Doin' It Again [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />I foresee the only time I will play this is having it playing in the background while I am doing something else (and not watching the actual video). The audio is good if not very produced.<br /><br />Together, the two 50th anniversary Beach Boys videos released in 2012 are my biggest disappointments this year.<br /><br />Thankfully I have the live show from Bangor in my memories and some memorabilia framed on my wall.<br /><br />READ MY OWN REVIEW OF THE JUNE 22, 2012 Bangor, ME show at BlueBirdReviews.com titled \\"THE BEACH BOYS 50th ANNIVERSARY CONCERT\\" by Matthew Joel Phillips.<br /><br />If you really want to see clips from their 50th anniversary tour I highly suggest saving your money and looking for clips on YouTube.2 Bangor, ME show at BlueBirdReviews.com titled \\"THE BEACH BOYS 50th ANNIVERSARY CONCERT\\" by Matthew Joel Phillips.<br /><br />If you really want to see clips from their 50th anniversary tour I highly suggest saving your money and looking for clips on YouTube.
B008MEM24S|5.0|...that's what my 6 yo daughter said when I asked her how many stars to give this. Love Phineas and Ferb, and this is a great follow-up to the classic Where's My Water.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This book got and held my attention, though thought the plot was a bit convoluted toward the end of the book.
B005P06AAO|1.0|The discs wouldn't load in the dvd player to watch them. I sent product back and am now waiting for the replacement dvds
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I liked the concept of the book. Although the book felt too rushed. It seemed that the 3 month trial lasted about two weeks because apart from awful dinners and some of the H work gatherings they didnt do much. It would of been nice to have the honeymoon in there to showcase their bond with one another.The two main characters were likeable but none of their real traits or qualities shined through. They connected well and their chemistry did become evident as the book progressed. I expected to love this book but ended up only liking it. I do still think its worth the read because it is heartwarming and sweet.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Have downloaded this recently and it plays very smoothly. Have it on my Galaxy Tab. It will come in handy when travelling. Nice app!
B00124LYHQ|5.0|The quality of the movie was fantastic. The audio was clear, and so were the visual aspects. Also, it was  very affordable.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|the whole twilight saga - the best movies I've ever seen. I didn't think I would like the vampire thing, but it's a great love story.
0307716988|5.0|I have read this autobiography before, when it first came out. It was such a hit and was hard to find. While the book looks simply written, Michael Jackson gets to the root of his feelings about his family, his talent, his life in and out of the business and how he has delt with being successful and how he uses his talents for the good. There will never be another Michael Jackson or anyone that is equivalent to his talent and presence ever! Reading this book again has brought back many great memories of seeing Mr. Jackson performing on the Motown television specials, to seeing his videos on MTV and VH1. The book is a re-issue with an introduction by Berry Gordy and an afterword from one of his original editors. The book remains largely the same as it was when it was first published in 1988. A must-read for true Michael Jackson fans! I also have this book in the Kindle version, which by the way, kept the same format as the book.
1451673442|1.0|It's just wishfull thinking. But it does put more money into Rhonda Byrne's pocket, so I guess it does work for one person.
0060555661|5.0|I purchased this book for my son and he loves it.  This book was highly recommended by a friend and is very informative.
B0045XICB2|5.0|the whole twilight saga - the best movies I've ever seen. I didn't think I would like the vampire thing, but it's a great love story.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|It is a great concept for a flight simulator that includes carrier landings. the problem was it wasn't executed very well. its graphics are okay. but it glitches. whenever I lower the flaps down on the c-2a, the end of the propeller shows through the flaps. I read the description and I know it said 3 planes, so I was hopping they were good quality.  well, that was a mistake. atleast have more like the F-16 or maybe the F-22 etc. in short view, buy it,  but you could verywell be dissapointed.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Great tools for finding words anytime on the fly.  Love this app.  My grandson uses uses it more than me.
B007REV4T8|1.0|Yes, I tried to watch this installment and its action. How many action movies we need? Maybe its time for some imagination? But, of course, I didnt like main character and especially this old chick from M16 whatever her name is, I guess she remind me Hillary--another ugly chick. In short this flick is mainstream movie appropriate for 1950th not 2012.
0439023513|1.0|I burned through the first two books and was eager to read the third one.  What a letdown!  She could have summed it up in a few paragraphs.  Peetah loves Katniss.  Katniss is torn between her love for Peetah and Gale.  Everybody on Katniss' side does everything that Katniss needs (including gratuitously sacrificing themselves), so Katniss doesn't have to tend to herself.  Meanwhile, the government and all the bad guys have the sole motive of manipulating poor Katniss.  In the last few paragraphs, she ends up with the obvious choice.  Oh yah... you get to relive many of the same ideas that helped to sell the first two books.  Very disappointing!
B0083Z614S|5.0|The secret Garden was one of my favorite movies. Normally I like to read the book first. But I wasn't disappointed. It was a very good book
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Have watched this three times now on my home entertainment system (55&#34; LCD, 6.1 surround sound) and have been very pleased. Really enjoyed the commentary by Joss Whedon - very frank in parts about the limitations due to budget, etc.<br /><br />Try out the two screen experience with the iPad app if you have an iPad (syncs to the sound of the movie and shows trivia, concept art, character information, etc. while viewing).
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is an excellent puzzel program. I just wish there were more in the selection. Please keep adding more puzels.
B009FXIICK|4.0|Downloaded to my kindle fire with no problems. This is another match three game with animals instead of jewels or colored shapes. Play gets fast very quickly so even if the animals are cute I think a child will become discouraged easily.
B000JQUHLM|3.0|Plllyanna Grows Up just wasn't what I quite expected. The camping trip seemed to drop off & I kinda lost interest at that point.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|worked really well .opens a bit slow when you first start it.  the fact it saves your work is really useful with bills and other things
1932100660|5.0|This is a very interesting book and it is easy to read and understand. I am very interested in my own health. and I would like to see my children and grandchildren benefit from my studying this book. I recomend it for any one who wants to be healthly.
1451638450|5.0|Lois McMaster Bujold has hit home run after home run with her stories about Miles Vorkosigan.  Miles is a short man whose body doesn't allow him to fight because of brittle bones.  Miles grew up in a warrior focused culture and he quickly learned to use his brain.  Ivan Vorpatril, a cousin, was a good foil for Miles.  Ivan would inevitably do something stupid, sometimes something really stupid, and Miles would save the day.  I came to think of Ivan's full name being \\"Ivan the idiot.\\"<br /><br />\\"Captain Vorpatril's Alliance\\" is a novel about Ivan.  The story is fair to the character we've gotten to know over the years and while Ivan is not near as clever as Miles, he does have some redeeming points.  The book starts off with Ivan recusing two damsels in distress.  Ivan is at Komarran when he encounters these women.  He takes them back to Barrayar where he hopes they'll be safe, but the danger and intrigue only ratchet up a level or two.<br /><br />On Barrayar we meet many of our favorite characters, but Ivan is always center stage.  It was fun to see the Emperor, Miles, Aral and so one, while the story stayed focused on Ivan's adventure.<br /><br />Maybe Lois McMasters Bujold is going branch out a bit more and write about some of the other characters in the Vorkosigan universe.  I would love to ready another story about Mile's brother(clone) Mark.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed previous Miles Vorkosigan stories I'm sure you will like this novel.  If you haven't read any Miles Vorkosigan stories, start with \\"The Warrior's Apprentice,\\" work through the full series, and then read \\"Captain Vorpatil's Alliance.\\"
B002M5E2DW|4.0|Completely misunderstood, but a good theory.  as long as its used as a tool...Too many people believe that you just 'think' it and it appears.
1401322786|5.0|It was thought provoking. I read it as soon as I received it. I'll read any book Mitch writes, fiction or non-fiction. Thanks.
1609611543|5.0|I really like this book. I haven't had time to read it all the way yet. But I am studying it and working on living it.
B0058YPLA2|1.0|This series has all the boring flavor of Narnia and all the awful \\"droppings\\" that followed.<br /><br />The people who make this kind of kiddy trash should have never relinquished their day jobs.
B004WR125O|5.0|Just like the title says, it does what it's intended to do.  I popped it in my Onkyo TX-NR616 and I was streaming internet radio in about three minutes.  Setup was quick and easy, just follow the onscreen menu and you're good to go.  I'm very happy with my AVR and this dongle to bring wifi to it.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Sorry what?! I was watching the lorax. It's an amazing retelling of a classic story. The first story i read to my daughter and she loves both.
1616960922|4.0|A short, quick, read. Sanderson's books are interesting because they are different in terms of magic systems and have solid characters. Good plot twists, but never hard to follow. 4 stars after first read, but may be higher after a reread. Desire to reread is the highest compliment I can give.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Entertaining show.  Different from what i expected, but still good.  Glad I rented instead of seeing it in the theater.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|dmr: great mahjong game.  the best of three that i 've tried.keep them coming.keeps me busy and entertained.  i never get bored
B0060AY6FO|1.0|I wanted so much to like this.  In fact I can't believe I finished it.  It's bad.  Not like Austen, and not a good mystery novel.  Just a lame book suckering a sucker like me.
B009M588K8|5.0|The book is a good account of the Bin Laden mission. My husband read it in a few days and couldn't wait to talk about it.  Very moving. Our son toured in Afghanistan so the information was very relevant.  It's a passionate subject for us. So ready for it all to be over!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Consistent continued excellence in a series.  This book has no drop off from the rest of the series.  An old character resurfaces which adds interest.  Very well written and all too real.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I watch a lot of movies with my 5 year old daughter, so I was excited to buy Brave when it came out on DVD. I am very interested in Scotland and it's culture so it was a treat for me just to see illustrations of Scotland and hear the characters talk. The other main things I love about this movie are the strong female main character (no princesses in need of saving by Prince Charming here!), and a positive mother-daughter relationship. Every other Disney princess I can think of either has no mom or a villain for a mom/step-mom. Loved this movie. I highly recommend it for all moms and daughters out there!
1451695187|5.0|I choose this book because of the subject matter and wanted to better understand Dr. Alexander's experience from his point of view. The bool was better than anticipated and both my wife and I have enjoyed our discussions after reading it. We have recommended the book to many of our friends and family.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My 12 year old loves this game.  He says it's very addicting.  He can't stop playing it.  It's easy too.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|after you update it it crashes and you can't. play any more.If about to get this game DON'T! get it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game. Keeps you thinking outside the box. Its very addictive. All of my friends have this game. Awesome game.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This collection of songs will appeal to a very wide range of listeners.  Thoughtful lyrics and inspired music.  Love it!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's fun and entertaining but my 12 year old says it can be a little hard at times.  Overall, he likes it though.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|Can't figure this game out even after reading the instructions.  Thank goodness I got this game free otherwise I would ask for my money back.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Before I started watching this series, I wasn't really a fan of &#34;zombie&#34; flicks. However, this show has changed that.
B008518MOW|2.0|This movie wasn't terrible, but Will Smith is sleepwalking through his roles now and just looks old. There was nothing special about this film at all. Smith looked bored and overpaid. The direction and editing was subpar and rushed. It's a terrible shame, but this could be a great franchise with different actors who care, and an exceptional director. What was promising in the first one, has yielded mediocrity in the sequels. Smith has to be to blame. It's such a shame, he was a very good actor in the 90's.
B008764ZQ4|2.0|I grew up on 80's music and I love the 80s bands.  In fact, last month I saw Poison and Def Leppard in concert at the Santa Barbara Bowl...awesome!  I like many of this actors as actors, but they don't sing well at all!  That's fine though, they aren't singers, except for Mary J Blige.  I think Tom Cruise is an excellent actor, a little crazy, but then again, I think you have to be crazy to be a good actor.  He does OK singing, not good, just OK.  Alec Baldwin, another one where sanity isn't a strength can be funny, but he's a horrible singer!  But again, that's OK.  The women singing on this album, except Catherine Zeta-Jones are really bad too.  Catherine Zeta Jones does an OK job.  I was surprised to hear her go off key a couple times on \\"Hit me with your best shot\\" since she's performed for years in theatre, sang and danced.  So to sum it up, bad singing, great songs of the 80's.  Like another reviewed said, \\"it's Ok if you know what you're getting\\".
030758836X|1.0|Sorry I wasted my money on this one. I disliked it immensely. The plot starts out intriguing, then gradually devolves into the ridiculous. The two main characters are self-serving, self-absorbed and after a while, hard to take. If this is an example of the best writing that's out there, we're in trouble.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|O-K, so the evidence would NEVER hold up in a real court; and real cops aren't as nice; intelligent; or as conscientious as Columbo - things that would normally turn me off of any other show....but Columbo is much more than any other show! Despite my opening criticisms, this is a show that one can become totally engrossed in. It keeps you engrossed from beginning to end- not with gimmicks, like action or gore, but with intrigue. Yes, I said intrigue- even though we know at the start who committed the crime; the intrigue enters when we try and fathom how Columbo will solve it! Truly a brilliant concept for a show, and so well executed in this series. In addition, there is always amusement/humor at Columbo's mannerisms; attire; car; dog, etc.<br /><br />But wait- there's MORE! This series is a treasure trove of past acting greats whose names most generation-Xers such as myself may have heard of, but we have never really had the chance to see perform. These were actors and actresses who took the craft seriously and had some real talent- unlike most of the ilk that inhabits Hollywood today. Sheesh! I'll give you 18 actors of today for one Jack Cassidy!(Who is in three episodes!)<br /><br />There's even more! Something about this show that I can't even put into words. It's the kind of show that you just want to sit and watch endlessly on a rainy night. It's pure entertainment, as it is so engrossing, and transports you to another world- as only the most well-made shows can. Not to mention the nostalgic aspect- as we get to see the cars and appliances and decor and fashion of the upper-middle-c lass-and-above world of the period (Which, in my case, brings back so many memories of how much better the world was then).<br /><br />I am SO thankful to be able to have the entire series to watch whenever I want and without commercials! Some of these eps I haven't seen since they first aired (Yes, I was a fan of this show even when I was 10 !!)- If you're already a fan of this show, you wouldn't be reading these reviews; if you have never seen Columbo.....you are in for a rare treat. This show is totally unique. I don't like cop shows in general- but this is no mere cop show! And it is suitable for everyone and the entire family, as there is no real violence shown, nor profanity. Even in the few scenarios where the villains are involved in affairs, you never see anything that you'd have to censor. A true class-act. This one has truly stood the test of time: I enjoyed it when I was 10- and I enjoy it even more now that I'm 50 !ow, you wouldn't be reading these reviews; if you have never seen Columbo.....you are in for a rare treat. This show is totally unique. I don't like cop shows in general- but this is no mere cop show! And it is suitable for everyone and the entire family, as there is no real violence shown, nor profanity.

B00422LESO|3.0|I wanted to love this as several of my friends read it and recommended it.  Unfortunately, it didn't work very well for me.  I found the story redundant and predictable and more than one character overdone.  There were lines not followed and details that didn't carry through.  In the end, it was an ok little romance and a very quick read.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|First, I must admit I am not a big animation fan. What got me kept watching it is its excellent storytelling style as well as the universal environmental theme, a theme for love, care and connection. Many may find it simplistic, but as Tolstoy once said in one of his short stories, maybe to reach the heaven of our human myth, we must relearn the naivette and innocence of a child. Throughout the movie, the young pricess tried her best to connect people and groups, as if she were a symbol of our tortured humanity--torn by environmental disaster, war, mutual yet unnecessary hostility. There is an appeal for the rise of divine feminine and it's interesting to see two of the lead characters are females. Without being neither too political or New-Agey about it, one can clearly see a salient message in the movie's depiction of secondary positions of the male characters and the female characters to be superior position. They are the one who cry out for tolerance, understanding, (except one power hungry female commander), and defy their own tribal rules when needed.<br />I think the movie pleads our good sense to prevail. Although, at the end of the movie, you will clearly see the director had one magic scene that blurs the gender divide, and he shows our humanity as a whole. You will find out what I mean, just watch the show.
0307592731|3.0|I liked this book. I have wanted to hike the PCT for a while now, but I didn't think I had the survival skills to do it.  After reading this book though, I think most anyone could do it! I admire her trip and her reasons for doing it, however, her obsession with sex was extremely annoying. After days of hiking, tens of miles, she comes to civilization, exhausted, wanting water, food, a shower and sleep......but then she spots a man and her focus is getting some! Jeez girl, give it a rest! I was disappointed with this story because it started out as a woman wanting to gain strength, but ended in a woman desperate to find men wherever she went. Minus 1 star for being so vague about the logistics of the trail, and minus 1 star for spending so many pages on sniffing out men.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I love it.... I down loaded it to my kindle fire hd.  And I love too watch this anytime.  Sooo cute. and my grandchildren love to watch it on the kindle also.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|I have told so many people to watch this movie, only to get skeptical looks in return.  My friend and I honestly went to the theater to see it as one of our, &#34;let's go watch and make fun of&#34; movies, but left so pleasantly surprised.  My husband thought I was nuts until I made him sit down and watch it and now he's a believer, too!  It's a great romp with historical accuracy and terrific acting.  Give it a go!
B004LVTTCO|3.0|Okay, there is definitely a problem with the price listed for this item.<br />I still give this movie 3 stars. The first half of the movie is just too harsh and cold.  I enjoyed the second half much better.<br />More on this later.
B00992CF6W|4.0|u need to be able to set things on fire with flint &amp; steel &amp; creative plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz do that for us
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|quick arrival time.  This in great package with no damage.  this movie is a sure buy 100 percent great.  I would say to anyone looking of a good movie, buy this.
B009329Y30|4.0|OK, when you're sitting down to watch a film based on a Nicholas Sparks book, your expectations can only be so high.  What you might expect is what you'll get here:  romance, struggle, resolution.  I'm giving four stars because that's what it is to me in the genre of sweet-mindless-romance-I-watch-when-I'm-exhausted/stressed/bored.  I didn't read the book, so I can't say anything about how true the adaptation is.  The movie moves slowly enough that you don't need to give it your full attention, which is helpful in a busy house.  Be careful, though, to not watch it with littlies about as there are a couple of steamy scenes.  One note:  I rented the HD version of this via Amazon Instant Video and had a couple of blank screen issues, causing me to stop the video and try to find my place again, which was slightly annoying.  So to wrap this up, if you're in the mood for a mindless romance, during which you could fold laundry or write letters or wander in and out of the room, this is a great pick.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Game starts by telling a story. On second screen talking about an Island I click continue and the app crashes
B0098L46YI|1.0|This was to be my favourite release of 2012. But what a dissapointment! A lot of tracks are sourced from vinyl, when proper masters are known to exist.<br />This is a shame for Shakatak's sound and a joke to us fans. We deserve far better than such an unfinished product!<br />Stay away from this one...
B000X4GXT0|5.0|I brought this from my kindle fire hd.  This is one of the greatest love storys and movies.  It has been great to watch this movie any time I want to.  I have it with me always.
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|OK, this movie would never win an award, but it sits in that sweet I-want-to-watch-a-mindless-romance category for me and I tend to watch it a few times a year.  It's a love story out of time with a tear jerking ending.  Beyond the romance is the tension of a difficult father / son relationship.  There's nothing particularly profound here; you won't walk away needing to tell people to watch this.  But if you're in the mood for something romantic that doesn't stress your intellect, this will fit the bill nicely.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Absolutely flawless. Amazing all the way around. Heath Ledger's performance is legendary. Chris Nolan's vision of Batman is definitive, and this is by far the best installment of the series. Own this movie.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|Charlize Theron screams instead of acts. Kristen Stewart can't scream or act. The DI-REC-TOR wishes he was in New Zealand with Hobbits and tried to CGI button push his way there when he should be at an intersection with white gloves and a whistle. I don't know who Chris Hemsworth is and fell asleep for fifteen minutes in the middle. If that makes this review incomplete, I apologize. Now let me get back to The Bowery Boys Volume One recently released by Warners. At least they knew how to do something consistent for twenty years!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album is spectacular; there really isn't anything negative I can say about it. I love the folk/bluegrass/rock side of the band's songs but in addition the vocals are pleasing, perhaps partly due to the fact that they are British but also just talented. Mumford & Sons continues to delight my ears with \\"Babel\\" as well, but to be honest Sigh No More I like even better, simply because I like ALL of the tracks on the album. Between the upbeat tracks there are also slower, heavier ones but they are still beautiful. Dust Bowl Dance is debatably the most angry track but I still love it; great lyrics. Thanks for making awesome music, Mumford & Sons!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Great movie and blue-ray disc was brand new in plastic. No sctraches, smudges, dents or anything to indicate it was just a used rewrapped Blu-ray Disc.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A good description of a difficult and dangerous field operation.  Our nation can be proud of these service members and their accomplishment.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this is a nice and simple app. handy to make quick calculations. i would recommend this app to any one.
0062060554|5.0|This has been one of my most enjoyed books this year. A complete break from my normal reading material this was selected for me by a co-worker at our community library. Fresh and well written this book makes you think which I love.
B007NU54H4|5.0|She is my good luck charm. This story just added a history of Tinker Bell life. The picture so awesome!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's simple and addictive game play will keep you coming back to pass the time over and over. Gadgets, clothes, jetpacks, and more are a way to give you a sense of persistent completion. Achievements are fun ways to keep you busy if you ever want a challenge and the leveling/prestige system give a great sense of accomplishment.<br /><br />Definitely worth it.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I love this game and I play it on my aunts ipad but its not for a kindel fire it glitches to much :( if u have a kindle just don't get the game
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I enjoy playing this and trying to draw as well as guessing other peoples drawings. Only thing I dont care for is the words all become repetative.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Proof of Heaven,<br /> This was a big disappointment to me as I expected to read about what transpired in &#34;Heaven&#34;, but most of the books was filler material, about family visits, flying experiences,etc.I didn't gain any knowledge and found myself skipping a lot of the mostly unimportant, irrelevant stuff.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I love this movie. I am a big Jimmy Stewart fan and he is so good in this. It's an old film, done in black and white and if you like this genre you'll enjoy this movie.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|I finished this book before I went to bed. Excellent read. Good characters, interesting.<br />I can't wait for the next book from Connelly.
B0013TTLDE|1.0|Not up to Kate Morton's standard...Lacks any depth to the characters and plods along. impossible to get interested in the book.Never finished this book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|love this app! its very fun to play on kindle. figured out that i could link it to my facebook which made it even better!
B006RXQ8RI|4.0|This is a fun movie, pure entertainment but of course can't be taken seriously.  A lot of action and subtle humor.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is the best game ever I really like the affects, I like it when you can shoot out webs.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have been using these headsets for a number of years. I like the fact that they are light weight and the sound is far superior to some of the most expensive ear-buds. Each set of these has lasted about 2-3 years before I have had to replace them. For the price the quality and sound are fantastic. I hope they never stop making them. These are the only headsets I will use.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|Even better then Volume 1.  Great acting, action and humor but it must be approached from attitude of just wanting to have fun.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Introspective view of faith and God.  A pure view of the subject that binds believers regardless of who we individually call our creator
B0000AK7AA|4.0|I got this for my 5 year old around Halloween time and she loves it... (and so do I!) Very cute movie all year round.
B0024HH32A|5.0|This classic should be in every library.  It is what started the longest running TV show, but don;t expect to see what you saw in the TV Series.  Great acting from  well known actors from that time period.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book is good, but very emotional, I had to stop reading at times because some parts were so sad. I loved the complete honesty in book.
B00006F2TV|4.0|My daughter loves all the Spiderman movies and I bought her one through three for Christmas... can't beat the price!
B004XWLN20|5.0|This is a great show. It's put together into a wonderful package and beautifully put together pictures from the series. I love it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this for anybody. I dont read a lot of fiction but this book had an amazing story and I am immediately buying the next one.

B008BUK0XI|5.0|Love Tom Cruise and all the Mission Impossible movies. This one will not disappoint the viewer. If you love action, you will love this movie.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|My husband and I love this show! Every season just gets better and better. Having it on DVD makes it awesome so you don't have to wait a whole week in between episodes to watch!
B001S86J0I|5.0|I  have always loved this ditsy space movie, and am giving it as Christmas gifts to quirky friends who could use a good laugh!
0345505387|4.0|Book arrived in very good condition. Haven't gotten to it reading wise, going through the whole series. Happy with my purchase.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|The movie, which needs no introduction is broken up into 2 parts. First 40 minutes is the training part, while the last is the Vietnam part. First part is fast paced with many memorable quotes, while the last part is much much slower - true to a typical Kubrick movie. I really enjoyed the movie. I won't bore you with a review of a 25 year old movie, but if you enjoy war movies or Kubrick movies or just want to see one of the more quotable movies of all time, this is for you.
B0098VXE50|5.0|After seeing the movie, the family wanted to add it to our collection.  The price here for it was really reasonable and we were very happy with it.
044022425X|4.0|Book arrived in very good condition. Reading this one now and going through the whole series. Happy with my purchase.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Prometheus does really well as the prequel for Alien.  It spins a good yarn as they say but when you compare the special effects between the three movies you can see such a big difference it's almost painful.  My one big question is - WHY???? They never do explain that. What did we do? It also shows things like how the medical beds/capsules are more advanced in the past than they were in Alien/Aliens so yeah, some of the stuff really sticks out like that. That advanced medical bed would have helped Ripley out.<br /><br />Another big discrepancy are holograms in Prometheus where as I remember the scene in Aliens where they had the big screen looking for the colonists in the table looking for them in the sublevels, this was the movie made how many years later too!  Some of the alien eggs are different too.  As a matter of fact so much of the movie is different I need to get the book so I can better understand everything what was going on.  The ending was a bit trite and would anyone in their right mind do that after what he did?  I guess she didn't know what he did to her guy but eventually she'll find out.  One thing that was a high point of the movie is how they showed the \\"giant\\" chamber from Alien where they showed the giant on the \\"couch\\" with his chest blown out from an Alien. They show a scene where Hal? the android activates the Giants' system...that scene was way cool and how they accomplished that WOW!  I would definitely recommend this movie.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I was very impressed with the writing and story telling of this author.  This is the first book that I have read by Patrick Rothfuss.<br /><br />The story was very compelling and has some truths which are hidden \\"between the lines\\".  Patrick's writing style is unlike any other author that I have read.  His words have a way of reaching the emotional level of the reader.<br /><br />I have just ordered the second book \\"The Wise Man's Fear: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two (Kingkiller Chronicles)\\" based on the good reviews and my experience reading the first book.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This movie is a favorite tradition for Thanksgiving day after all the football and turkey.  Black and white or colored it is a great movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Would be 5 stars if there were zoom to make rooms easier to search. Nice plot; like that it's available on tablet.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Great game pad! Comfortable, really easy to use, and doesn't take up too much desk space.  It's durable: I'm very clumsy and knock it off my desk often, and it still works perfectly.  Good value. Works great for me a, mild World of Warcraft player.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|File management and searches work extremely well. Being able to manipulate multiple files at a time is also a plus.
0316017922|5.0|I got a great deal for this used book that I purchased for my daughter that started going to college. The prices for these books at the college book store are ridiculous, and they even charge a lot of money for used books as well. This used book was in good condition when I received it. The only gripe I have is that it took more than a week to receive it. If you want to save lots of money on college books, this is the way to go, you save a bundle. I will use this method of buying used books in the future until my daughter graduates.<br /><br />I recommend this item for anyone that has a child in college and wants to save lots of money on purchasing used books.
0446573027|4.0|People are being unfair in saying this is the same book as Child's the affair. Yes, it does seem like the two authors got together and agreed to each write a book with a few striking characteristics in common (military death, hard core military investigator, hushed up so only one investigator, small town in the middle of nowhere, female police officer). But, after that the commonality disappears for the most part and the story arcs are quite different. The fact that one is in an Army town and one is not is very notable.The underlying cause/issue is very very different.<br />All that said, this book becomes kind of absurd and insane in the last 50 pages, but it still is a good read. Has plenty of plot twists and false paths.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|First of all, I dont see why so many people have given this a bad review... You must know what you are getting into before you watch it. Obviously there will be racy situations, poor judgement, awkward moments, and be offensive. This movie is hilarious (to me) All you people who got offended watching to movie why didn't you just turn it off? Every time I go to the theater to watch one of his movies people always are walking out... I ask myself, why the heck did you come in the first place? Seriously, this movie is not for the easily offended.
B009JBZH54|5.0|excellent movies, all three, and for $30 is one of the best priced bluray collections i've ever seen.  so tired of reading \\"if you're a TRUE fan\\" which i am.  was reading batman even before the Burton films.  i don't care that they're releasing an ultimate trilogy version.  if you want to pay out the butt for extra material, go ahead bc this version has enough for me.  anyone w/half a brain knows that people will put the ultimate material on youtube eventually.  so i'll grab this for 30, replace my begins and dark knight dvds w/the blurays, and enjoy the bonus discs w/out having to wait for some overpriced, over-lauded edition is released next year sometime.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is seriously one of the best books I've ever read!  For many of the little vignettes I would've been willing to read an entire just on that person's story.  I highly recommend this to any horror fan.
B002MUAJ2A|3.0|Whether a principle in a startup, an independent consultant or a desk jockey in a Fortune 500, rework provides many great insights.  The organization of the book and short/concise topics make it a quick and effective read.  At times even inspirational.  I wish all middle managers at software firms were made to read it.  And could LEND it to each other!
B003YL4KS0|4.0|I truly enjoyed this read. It was very informative. Who would have thought that something as simple as not using shampoo and throwing out your brush and comb could make such a huge difference in the health of your hair. Also. the trimming method for curly hair is revolutionary:)
0316228532|5.0|J.K. Rowling wrote a novel for adults. She wrote a political statement. Most of all, she wrote a novel about humanity. Written from a third person omniscient point of view, Rowling granted the readers glimpses into the innermost thoughts and emotions of over fifteen different citizens of the small town of Pagford. The result presented itself as a tragically honest portrait of the human condition.<br /><br />Admittedly, in the echo of most of the Harry Potter books, The Casual Vacancy began slowly. At first, I thought Rowling might prove to disappoint as an adult novelist. However, I quickly retracted my position as her novel sucked me into Pagfordian life.<br /><br />The reality in the small British town forced the reader to confront both sides of political issues facing voters worldwide while demonstrating how politics affected people individually. In this way, Rowling brought home the trickle-down effects of government policies, from the general, necessary budget cuts to the affected shattered family.<br /><br />Rowling imprinted a story on my brain, a mark I will continue to relive until she deigns us with another classic.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Pixar's 2012 animated feature Brave stands apart from the wealth of princess-based movies which came before it. Where most princesses sit around gazing moonily at a bird and hoping for a prince to rescue them, Merida picks up her own sword, takes charge of her own life, and at the end of the film, is still proudly carving her own path - putting off thoughts of marriage until later.<br /><br />It is quite clear from the very beginning that the team at Pixar knew what they were doing in the archery and sword-fighting scenes. I've taken medieval swordfighting classes for several years and have spent far more years attending reenactments and watching swordplay. The movements in Brave are nearly perfect; in many cases they were exactly what I was taught to do. I remember thinking, in a pivotal scene where Merida holds off an assailant with her sword, \\"hey, I know that pose!\\"<br /><br />In the commentary we learn that the team did know how to sword-fight and mapped out all the combat sequences in real life before transferring them to the screen. So these aren't just fantasy versions of sword fights. They are realistic, authentic looks as to how these swords were handled.<br /><br />The same is true for the archery. They show the details about how the arrow bends as it flies, the way the bow is held, and so on.<br /><br />It's true that Merida's mom is not thrilled about Merida's sword-and-bow interests, but that conflict between mother and daughter is the whole heart of the film. Merida's mom has one, specific track in mind her for daughter - become part of a clan merger. And, to be fair, this was often the way marriage was in medieval times. Nobles had to ensure their land was protected and their borders secure. It was a quite practical situation. So the mother's stance is understandable. So is the daughter's.<br /><br />I give the story great praise. Sure, it's a bit predictable. We could almost recite some of the lines along with the characters, knowing what they were likely to say. Still, the underlying message is wonderful and miles apart from the 1937 Snow White. Snow White sat around waiting for her prince to come, with no thought of doing anything for herself. Merida has plenty she wants to do with her life, and has little interest in a prince coming to take control.<br /><br />Well recommended.likely to say.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|again a great books that should be at school lib. Waiting for more books in series. Missed the tv series the first time will not next time
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book. I dont know how I will be able to stand waiting for the next one. I want to read it now.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I enjoy the Rapp character, as always and it had a interesting plot, but I still did find it plausible that one person was entrusted with so many secrets and sent to a war zone.  Otherwise, I was happy with the book
B007EECSFA|5.0|A wonderful, fulfilling, moving and involving book.  Ms. Morton continues to delight with her many-layered story line and her marvelous characters.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I am constantly trying out new games and it is only a very few exceptions that are fun and keep me interested.  I hesitated buying this game but did, based on all of the great reviews.  I am so happy I did!  I have found it to be entertaining and gorgeous to look at.  I have to spend a lot of time in Dr waiting rooms and this is a game I can put aside at a moment's notice and fire it back up when I'm ready and be right where I left off.  Lots and lots of puzzles to solve but if you get stuck there is always a hint for you.  I highly recommend Stray Souls!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a fun game.  I like the various ways you can choose to play mahjong and the way it shuffles the tiles when there are no plays left.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I spend a good amount of time on facebook so I appreciate an app in the first place. Sometimes it stops loading atthe bottom and I can't see &#34;more stories&#34; but all in all, a pretty good app that could use a little tweaking.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you love jigsaw puzzles you will love this app.  They have loads of FREE, yes I said free, puzzles.  It totally surprised me that they were really free.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|A little dented not to bad. One of my fave movies great x-mas gift. Katy Perry is amazing! Love it
1742200206|4.0|The Lonely Planet series is usually substance without frills and this New York City guide certainly falls into that category.  Lots of good fundamental information about the real estate, culture and shopping venues of the city--written with a first-time visitor in mind.  All the boroughs and sections of Long Island are given some space here, although Manhattan and Brooklyn get the most attention.  The guide opens with the authors' idea of the 16 iconic and must-see aspects of NY and takes off from there.  The book's greatest strength is probably its general overview of the place.  It includes a modest number of suggestions for lodging, food and entertainment. Lodging possibilities can and should be researched further on the Internet where the list of hotels, inns, etc. is huge and bargains do exist.<br /><br />Shopping gets special attention on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis.  Good approach, but if you're a first-time visitor to NYC using this guide, keep in mind that stores tend to come and go frequently and even annual sales events can change dates from year to year.  The guide includes a \\"Month-by-Month\\" calendar of events, but this is very limited and doesn't come near to mentioning the hundreds happening hour-by-hour every day of the week.  If you use this guide, you'll want to supplement with New York Magazine, The New Yorker, etc. to get a full cultural schedule.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty good effort that probably will work best for the newcomer who can't or doesn't want to get bogged down in the overwhelmingness of the Big Apple.  Priced at a moderate $19.99.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I bit long winded of a film. It also didn't include many surprises. I have not read the books to use as a point of comparison. Overall, a decent flick, if a bit boring.
B002XHNMW6|5.0|I can't believe that I hadn't read this classic.  Although I knew all about the story from the various films on the subject, I couldn't put it down and actually shed a few tears.  A very fast read and still very actual.
B00846REIS|2.0|I really did not like this book. It was well written and all that jazz, but the storyline and characters... blah. Just about every character was mental. And I'm not complaining about that because that made it interesting, it was just the way it was executed. It didn't flow right, or maybe there just wasn't enough emotion behind the dialogue. I don't know.<br /><br />I don't understand how this could be compared to 50 Shades? There were similar undertones, but no concrete comparison.
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed Proof of Heaven and have recommended it to others. It was a book that I did not want to put down until finished. I wish he had explained in more detail some of the things he learned while in heaven. Coming from the prospective of a Neurogergeon made it more compeling.

B008B1VYP0|5.0|There isn't a song on this album that I don't like! Adam Levine is so talented! The explicit version is a little more explicit than i thought it would be so for those looking for a &#34;family&#34; version go with the other copy for the same price
B007MDB6L0|5.0|We enjoy all the Tinkerbell movies. My daughter watches it a few times a week. I would recommend the movie.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|You don't need to read someone's opinion of music, just listen to the previews on Amazon and judge for yourself. You shouldn't even be on this page, either buy it or don't.
B0026P3G12|5.0|She is a delight...love her unassuming manner on-stage.  She has a beautiful, strong voice with a vast range.  ...so glad she took the chance to appear on the UK tv show and certainly thankful she won and shares her music with the world!

B00004XQ83|4.0|Especially loved the uniqueness of the movie, so we wanted the music.  It is refreshing and a pleasure to listen to.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Surprisingly good read for me. The story being told through multiple geopolitical settings gave it a real sense of history.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting book. I really enjoy reading true stories especially first hand from people that were actually there. Not just someones interpretation of what they were told by someone. I highly recommend this book.
B00962341U|3.0|I bought this CD from a seller from the Oxford-UK who was not very customer-service oriented.  Also, Amazon didn't help either with this transaction.<br /><br />This is a 2-CD and while the CD showcases Leona's voice well, I thought the selection of songs could've been better.  I mean, there's a couple of catchy tunes but other than that, it's just filler.  I mean, if you didn't buy Leona's last CD, buy this one, otherwise, skip it or buy it used.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat as i read this very couragious true story. I would definatly recommend this book

B004Y1USJE|4.0|FFH brings Yes to the modern age using old Horn/Downes material re-imagined.  Sure, people gripe that Jon Anderson isn't in the band anymore for this reason or that (citing his health [see '08]-  a crock to anybody who's paid attention to Anderson's schedule over recent years...).  The truth is Howe, Squire, and White /Anderson (or Wakeman, for that matter) simply can no long tolerate each other: that's sad but that's what it is.  Okay, this brings us to this Yes lineup...  yes, it's the one that 'functioned' to made a new record.  To me, new music by an established ongoing act is what keeps them from the classification of being 'an oldies band' or worse yet 'a cover band'.  Sure Yes did the singer thing like so many other older bands...  but give Beniot David a chance-  he really has a nice voice-  sometimes a bit to soft without edge.  Some claim that he sounds like Anderson, but after listening to FFH, I'd say he's more closer in voice to Trevor Horn.  Since the balk of the material is recycled from the Horn/Downes catalog, it only made sense for the band to discard Oliver Walkman during the final stages of the recording as Geoff played virtually all of the keys on FFH.  Oliver's time in Yes should be treated fairly but it seems he'd be better off without a full album with Yes-  A Walkman not named Rick doesn't go right long term in Yes.  I really liked the tunes on this album,  not too heavy, not too light.  FFH suite makes you desire more.  It's too bad that Yes immediately moved on from David as singer when he became ill last year-  I wish the boys would have settled into a long term singer situation that having anybody fronting them be termed 'current'.  I saw and hoped this album as a beginning refreshment more in a sense of finding a new long term diirection for the aging Yes...  revamped Asia with Howe, Downes  having 3 new Asia albums in recent years; it appears that the Downes writing machine is still going strong and hope his return to Yes keys chair keep that going.  To the same extent, I'd love to see a long term producer relationship with band and Trevor Horn.  Some might not like that idea for Yes, but I think Downes and Horn have again brought a wounded Yes back to relavance with FFH.  Let's hope for more stability with the current guy or some final leg peace with Anderson and company that result in material (new recordings) for the years to come.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  The pro version is worth the money.  You need to try this game.  You won't be sorry
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Finally I was able to find a reliable calendar. My own gmail calendar thats free to use on everything but the Kindle. Anyways after downloading this app, my gmail calendar was on my kindle and I could update it with or without wifi and when connected to wifi it would update my calendar online. Since my gmail is connected to my husbands calendar Im able to view both our agenda's and it works perfectly. Very happy with this app.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|I really enjoyed the game of thrones series by George Martin, its a very well written story with indepth character backgrounds, immersive descriptions of environment, intertwining storylines, and plenty of fantasy lore.<br /><br />I only have 2 complaints about this series.<br />1. Why do we have to wait so many years before the next one!?!?<br />2. There is some repetition in character innuendo and intimacy scenes, both of which vary only a small amount accross a wide variety of character background and different cultures throughout the series.
B0088XXCZ6|3.0|I like it but in my opinion she hasn't put out anything that touches &#34;When the Pawn.&#34; As a whole I probably like it a bit better than Extraordinary machine.
B00943SP0G|4.0|Halarious movie, Depp as always puts on a good show, nice little twist to the genre.  Reason I put 4 stars is the kind of rushed ending where they tried to introduce / finish out too many story lines at once and the wherewolf bit was a little tacky.
B000VNQV36|5.0|I have to give this five stars if for no other reason than it has one of my top five songs of all time on it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book for the first time about 10 years ago and it touched me just as much if not a little more the second time. Back then it touched me because I was young and care free and worried about college and my crush. This time I was touched more for the deeper, emotional issues that Charlie was wrapped up in because I'm dealing with tough issues in my life now. I absolutely love this book. One of my top 5 I've ever read and I will frequent it more than every 10 years. Just like Charlie said he didn't like the movie because he didn't feel different after he watched it - so many books have been like that for me. Then I pick up The Perks...and am totally engrossed and touched and feel completely different after I read it. I can't say enough good things. I love it that much.
B008E374T0|5.0|I can't explain to you how beautiful this album is. I honestly can't stop listening to it.<br />I believe that fans of The '59 Sound will really apprieciate this album. The band has really pulled-together for this work; Brian's voice has gotten stronger, the lyrics are deeper (and they don't use a girl's name in every song! ;D ), and their sheer sound is angelic...... An angel of rock and roll.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I got this to amp my headphones for gaming/movies on my PC.<br /><br />I must say that for such a cheap price, this thing is awesome.  The only issue I have is with games it doesn't amp it quite enough.  So depending on what you intend to use it for I would take this into consideration.<br /><br />If you plan to use it for games, you may want to step up to a E7 because from my testing games source audio is not as loud and so it doesn't amp up quite enough for my taste.  When playing movies and audio though, I was able to get an ample amount and beyond of volume..<br /><br />So in hindsight I would have (and still may do so) gotten an E7...but still this thing is great for the price.  I thought it was much bigger also but it's the exact size of the old iPod shuffles..in fact I think that's what it's made from.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My boys love Bad Piggies.  I do not care for it as much as Angry Birds, but it's a great problem solver for them.  They have to take the objects they're given, form a rolling cart for the pig, and complete the task.  The goal is to get three stars on each task.  Based on how they assessed the landscape and the objects on the cart they made, they must 'fire off' the soda bottles, or turn fans on/off to be successful.  Otherwise, they go back to the drawing board and start again, or tweak their creation.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was the perfect book for a middle school outsider. I rated it five star because it had all of the high quality expectations that Jeff Kinney typically provides throughout the entire diary of a wimpy kid series. I highly recommend this book to all children of any age.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Very addicting game!  My boys and I love Angry Birds, and have little competitions sometimes to better each others' scores.  It would be nice to have some of the 'cheats' like the scope or the birdquake from Angry Birds Friends, but we can't take away any stars because they are not included in this one.
B00A77II0U|5.0|The story was original, lots of creepy places to discover, and lots of different kinds of activities. The puzzles could have been a little more difficult but that's a very minor criticism.  I highly recommend this game.
0553386697|5.0|THe Whole-Brain Child: Every parent should read this book--it is the beginning of teaching discipline which is so lacking in parenting today--positive approach, does not just sit on punishment but teaches children how to learn and do emotional contro--something all of society needs especially now when so much is out of control.
0525953728|4.0|The book starts off slow but once the green light for the mission happens its really cool to get a first hand account of taking out the most wanted man on the planet.<br /><br />Hats off to these men who went into the belly of the beast and took no casualties.  The book is written with a fly on the wall approach.  No secrets or intel was given out that and avg or above avg person old take away.<br /><br />Worth the read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn does it again! His knowledge of today's political climate is amazing and his character, Mitch Rapp is the kind of hero we all want in our corner. Do yourself a favor, settle in for a long reading session as you won't want to put this book down. By the way, this is not just a &#34;man's book&#34;, I am a female and I can't put this down.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD 7'' and had no problems with the download or with game play.  I was a little lost at first, there's no instruction or help in navigating.  If you don't have much experience with these kinds of games, you may get frustrated and give up easily.  Also, there are hints to help you through the game.  You can access them by taping your bag in the lower left hand corner of the screen, and then clicking on your journal in your inventory.  When the journal opens, tap on the yellow Hint button in the lower right hand corner.<br /><br />The game was quick, easily solved in an hour or 2, relaxing and enjoyable.The hints were detailed enough to keep you moving forward and easy to access.  It would appeal to those who enjoy working through puzzle games.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book is really fun and entertaining for all ages.<br />I love this book a lot. Everyone should read this book
B008RV5K5E|5.0|What can u say? It's Batman  older bitter meaner and still the best!!!  Part two please come out soon!!! Frank Miller's vision on DVD.
1615470158|5.0|I follow the blog of the author, Rob Collie. After seeing the video of the book getting printed I knew that I had to buy it. Oh, that and I'm a big PowerPivot fan and general Excel junkie. The book is a blast. Rob has a great writing style, honest and fun.<br /><br />First, PowerPivot doesn't put Excel on steroids. Nor does it turbo charge it. Those metaphors fall short. It's more like PowerPivot takes a solid family sedan that you think you know and turns it into a NASCAR race car.<br /><br />DAX Formulas for PowerPivot walks you through PowerPivot and how to get the most out of it's powerful DAX formulas. This not merely a reference book. It's full of how to's. Plus it's got nice big illustrations. I do have a couple of warnings for this book though:<br /><br />1) I found myself up very late playing with PowerPivot stuff while reading this book. Don't start the book if something to do the next day, like go to work. Seriously, I'm not kidding.<br /><br />2) Read the whole book. I had a personal project that coincided with some of the items in the book, so I started the project while reading the book. I ended up rebuilding the project twice as I worked through the examples. In my initial pass, my project was taking more than a minute to reload the data from the database. After following Rob's performance tips at the end, the reload was down to 13 seconds.<br /><br />3) The short links to more information are case sensitive and contain both upper and lower case letters. Be careful when you type them.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you use Excel for anything, and you can spell PowerPivot, you owe it to yourself to see what it can really do. This the book to teach you how.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is excellent,it allows you to make as many notebooks as you want. Drawn notes, and text notes,and you can attach pictures , easy to use,easy to keep your thoughts organized and the best part you can convert your notebooks into PDFs and email them. I am really enjoying this app
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The movie is a little far fetched about being able to travel to an alien world millions of miles away within a persons life time. Once you can get over that fact, the discovery process that the humans make to find the aliens and the predators is very exciting. The visual effects are awesome and Ridley Scott leaves everyone with a cliff hanger. If you have enjoyed the previous aliens movies this is definitely one to see.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Good book.  Yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada and so forth. Word.
B008OB1QFK|5.0|\\"Little Victories\\" is a strong outing by Chris Knight.  His hard-hitting, hard-luck tales of woe & redemption continue to fascinate me.  The rocking opener \\"In the Mean Time\\" blows the roof off with a hard rocking track studded with churning electric guitars and Chris' vocals in perpetual snarl, \\"Sometimes I wonder where the next dollar's going to come from; I keep my head up till something falls out of the sky; Daddy taught me how to use my boot straps & carry on; He said, 'God'll be good to you son if you try.'\\"  \\"Nothing On Me\\" is another addictively great tune with the guitars droning on like a guy who labors day-to-day trying to make his rent, \\"Times are tough but they ain't got nothing on me.\\"  \\"Hard Edges\\" is another of my favorites with the banjo picking out the simple melody with Chris' vocals like a whispered conscience, \\"Lisa's in a club downtown where the neon burns till dawn, She calls herself Tina now, but she dances to the same old song.\\"  This is a strong set, another little victory.  Enjoy!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|It was fun for a while but halfway through the game it deleted all my hard work.So enless you want to play it just a day you should not get it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is hours of fun, with levels for every player.  Using the touch part of my kindle fire, Flow Free give me something to play with if I have 5 minutes or 5 hours.
6305428352|5.0|We had the opportunity to watch this movie after seeing is when it first came out in 1996. Mr. Holland's Opus has always been one of my faviorte movies. It is one of those movies that touches your soul and inspires you to be the best you can be in all areas of your life. It teaches us that we all can make a difference in anothers life, no matter what your job or status is in life. Be the best that you can be! This movie is rated PG, and is not filled with gore, foul language, or explicit scenes that are demeaning to women. I would like to relay to movie makers that we appreciate these types of creations, and that there are still many of us who want to watch this type of movie. Its not all about making money, but making a differnce and sharing the talents with others. Thank you to Richard Dreyfuss and all who made this inspiring movie.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am so grateful to you. As a first time author, I am now on a global map. The delivery was effortless; the instructions easy to follow and the customer service was top notch too. I am very pleased. Thank you.<br /><br />MaryAnn Fry, Author of GOING NAKED BEING SEEN
B00992CF6W|5.0|The 7 dollars are worth every penny. You can create anything you heart desires! This isn't as good as the x box edition but its still worthit.
B003V5CFV8|4.0|Strange twists and interesting characters make this movie a riot.  Made for a good escape from my usual viewing.  Will recommend to others.
B007TML4EI|5.0|If you enjoyed playing with an erector set or Lincoln logs then this might be one of the most entertaining games you will ever play
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Great songs. Amazon cloud is SSSOOOOO convenient. Great album.<br />Do they still call it album?? Oh well. Love it. Thanks.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This was a great little game and did a wonderful job of wasting large portions of my day while I waited at appointments.
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|I love Bruno's voice, style and attitude. He is my favorite current artist, and I plan on purchasing any music he puts out.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is great to have access to a calculator that is easy to use. It is large enough & the keys are easy to click
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I've always been a big fan of the weather channel.  Like every other media outlet they're<br />now more commercials than programng. This app is a nice addition to a great device, my Kindle. In HD too!
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book is excellent!  I have read many of Ken Follett's books, and they are awesome.  Ken does his research well, and has a great imagination.  He is one of my favorite authors.
B0087HT36U|4.0|it is a good time waster.  I killed many a good hours playing this app. it is worth a try if you have nothing better to do
B003719GGS|5.0|Well written, useful. I can see applications from the book in short order, and in multiple arenas in my life. Recommended.
B0015DROBO|5.0|You may need to scan over a few of the more boring sections, particularly when background information on financial investing, etc. is discussed. Overall, a decent read and well-developed characters.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|After usingthe free version and also several other programs,  I bought this one.  I only rated it four stars because it 's not three dimensional enough... you can 't always tell if a tile has any free sides.<br /><br />-
B009VB97EY|5.0|Great movie and great price. Recommended to anyone who likes the actors and just wants to have a little fun.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is very helpful when wanting to know what the weather will look like if your planning a trip.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the Vince Flynn books.  This is on of the best.  Eerie how it matches with recent events.
0765365278|5.0|Picked it up because I liked the way Sanderson is finishing Jordans WoT. Going to add my mark to the tons of good reviews about this book. Really unique magic system, very well written. Looking forward to the next book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I wish more games were unlocked at the beginning but other than that ...it's great. no real complaints here. keep up the good work.
B00471JSR4|5.0|A great, dumb action film that only serves to entertain. Never takes itself too seriously, and the action scenes are awesome. The cartoon dialogue is just right for this \\"park-your-brain-at-the-door gem, and the Paris chase scene packs one heck of a punch! The Blu ray's sound and picture are great. Perfect film for a person who loves movies of escapism.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|By book Two the characters were very likable and I couldn't wait to find out  how the relationships would grow.  However, it was always a surprise and not predictable at all.  GinnieLee
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Jurassic Park is one of my favorite movies and it looks fantastic on Blu ray. Toss the sequels in the trash or use them as coasters and enjoy the original. The sound is awesome and the dinosaurs still look as amazing as ever!
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the Crossfire Trilogy almost as much as Fifty Shades.  Characters were compelling and story line kept me reading non-stop.  GinnieLee
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|John Green has a decent way of portraying relationships and writing dialogue: though not entirely realistic, both are able to affect readers and make them sympathize with the characters and their situation.<br /><br />Although I couldn't consider reading this book a total waste of time, I found it was entirely forgettable. Perhaps a good term for it would be &#34;light reading,&#34; which is definitely not what you want this book to be because it deals with death, sickness, and the tragically short existence of human beings.<br /><br />All in all, it was an OK effort on Green's part but it fails to pull readers into the story, and leaves no lasting impressions.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was really hooked by  book three.  Characters were remarkable and quite a page turner. Hated for the book to end and look forward to another installment. GinnieLee
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think flow free is a very good game you have to use a lot of strategy and thinking.its a very challenging game. for those of you who like challenging you should get this game
B009GX6600|5.0|Always great entertainment, love the interaction of all the characters and story lines are always intriguing, not predictable.  Love the humor.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is one of the few games that I have finished, then started playing all over again.  Game gets progressively more difficult, but not to the point where it is impossible. If you are looking for something to pass the time, I would highly recommend this game.
B00170DEM8|5.0|Gifted people should always be an inspiration...does anyone not want to dance like Fred Astaire and easily sing like Bing Crosby.  Holiday time isn't complete without the tradition of this movie.  What's more fun than seeing grandchildren try to dance like Fred Astaire!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Everyone should read this book.  Lively discussions in our book club! Certainly gives one a new perspective andalusia for being thankful for the life we enjoy.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! It is definitely not a book that will change your outlook on life, but it is truly an amazing read. This book is not your typical love story; it is raw, real, and it hurts which is what I love about it. I can honestly say that I will read this book again and again and I know it will be just as good each time I read it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I liked the first season and the next two do not disappoint you. My husband really likes this tv show.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is freaking awesome.  you update it by.  you go. to app store then you click on the minecraft app and it should say update
B0019UGYK0|2.0|DVD was loose in its packaging allowing it to be scratched and totally non usable from receipt making the total purchase a loss...
B006WQLH7G|5.0|avast is the best antivirus and it is free, have it on all my electronics,3 pcs ,ipad ,kindel, iphone. great
B004NELBPC|5.0|The HuffPo mobile app is exactly what you think it will be. It is clean, clear, easy to use. I actually like the mobile app better than the web site, as it is less jumbled. The stories are current and refresh frequently, like the web site you can view your news by category. The app makes it easy to select which news categories you prioritize and move them to the head of the list.<br />I would reccommend this app to anyone who wants to read HuffPo content on the go.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I chose &#34;5&#34; stars due to the incredible talents of those in the cast PLUS a great story line that could very well lead to a super sequel!
B004WR125O|2.0|The title says it all. I did by a used one though. Luckily i hardly ever us the wireless feature so i really dont care.
B005LAIGNC|3.0|...but instead it was more of a standard action flick with excellent special effects.  with all the great actors in the movie i expected a little more.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|1st time I opened the package, there was only the cardboard incert, no product.<br />I called amazon expecting I the worst but they took care of it for free and got next day shipping.<br /><br />Sharpener is good, smaller than expected but works fine.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Terrific story, a book that seems ahead of it's time. Can't believe I missed this one when I was growing up!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Love the return to the present and liked this book a lot. Good writing as usual and this time the book didnt end with only &#34;70%&#34; completion showing on my kindle. Thanks for that fix, and thanks for another great edition to the series!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|i downloaded this and all it does is crash on the second screen. not a very good app of the day, you would think an app of the day would work
B0085A9J18|5.0|One of the best action movies I have seen in a long long time. Saw it twice in theaters and bought the dvd. Safe to say I am sold.<br /><br />Great fight choreography and brutal fighting. Cant wait for the next one!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great Mitch Rapp novel..Can't get enough of Mitch Rapp. Vince Flynn tells a great story once again. 2 thumbs up!!!!!
B008RTE066|2.0|I am a major Beatles fan, and my wife will attest that I am just short of obsessed with them.  I'm 62, and have clear memories of the first appearance of Capitol Beatles promotional material in record store windows, and was glued to my tv set on the Sunday night in February when they burst into \\"All My Loving\\" on Ed Sullivan.  I LOVE the Beatles.  But because of what I heard about Magical Mystery Tour when it first came out and the bits a saw in various Beatles documentaries, I resisted seeing it.  However, when this set came out, I took a chance.  I think \\"I Am the Walrus\\" is one of the top twenty Beatles songs, and while I was never a major fan of Blue Jay Way and think \\"Fool on the Hill\\" is overrated, I like the music from the soundtrack well enough,  so I figured this set with the 64 page book, and the 5.1 blue ray mastering would be worth watching.<br /><br />I was wrong.  Everything that the critics said was wrong with MMT is accurate.  It is simply a self-indulgent, meandering, tedious waste of time and music.  Paul McCartney's commentary will only serve to sadden Beatles fans because Sir Paul while making it clear that the Beatles simply made use of their fame to make a film without a script or point, is unwilling to admit it is less than a wonderful piece of \\"art.\\"  The only really stand-out scene is the wonderful performance by Victor Spinetti, who appeared in both Hard Day's Night and Help.<br /><br />The book and packaging is very good, and for those who don't own the original two 45 Britsh release of the soundtrack, that is a wonderful souvenir.  And, finally, any release of Beatles music in 5.1 surround sound is great.<br /><br />But the main course, the film itself, is close to terrible and serves to establish that the loss of Brian Epstein, whatever his shortcomings in financial acumen, seems to have left the Beatles without any sense of direction.  The synergy and genius of John, Paul, and George with some input from Ringo, was such that the boys continued to produce great music after Brian's death, and, almost miraculously, amid the near certainty that they were in the process of crashing and burning, they turned out one of the ten best albums of all time, Abbey Road, as a finale.  But MMT is the signpost that pointed to a likely disintegration of the group.  I'm certainly glad i didn't see it in 1967.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Damn that Christian Grey!  He is one screwed up individual.  Leaves you wondering...  What is so horrible?  Why can't he accept things?
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This is the kind of book that I love to curl up with and get lost in. Kate Morton opened a window into early 20th century England  that I found fascinating.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|I can't imagine a project that this product wouldn't cover your needs. There is every imaginable screw head included and some that I've never even heard of before. You can tell these are high-quality bits, as I have had to remove a few stubborn screws and applied a lot of pressure that would have eaten up some of the cheaper screw bits i have had in the past. these held up nicely.
B000NQRE1E|4.0|This is just a good movie and I have always been intrigued by anything related to the Titanic.<br />The multiple discs make it easy for me to play it in my Blu-Ray player, and the DVD disc can be played in any normal DVD player.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp hits his violent, cynical stride in this latest in the series. As always there is little patience wasted on self-righteous bureaucrats and incompetents. No touchy-feelie aging operator here. How Vince comes up with some of this stuff is beyond me. He obviously spent a good amount of time in a very dark place. Plenty of violence and munitions to satisfy the most ardent Rapp fan. Mitch even manages to get his bell rung on occasion. Rapp in all his glory! Enjoy!
B007MDB6L0|4.0|This was purchased for my Grandaughter and she watches it all the time.<br />She is 6 years old and loves anything like this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game on earth but it needs a free version and a lower price then it would be awesome
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is great for everyone! If you are a subconscious sleeper, (like me), it even has a setting where you have to do a math problem before you hit snooze. You can choose from a variety from noises and the most detailed setting to perfectly fit your &quot;alarm style&quot;. It is like my dream alarm clock!
B0053O89YM|5.0|I only watched one episode of this series on TV, it was in the third season.  I really liked it and have enjoyed watching the first season so far, I will be buying the foiurth when it coms out, please let me know.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Unique sound, hard to categorize but highly addicting.  Bought this album last summer and still listen to it a lot.  Hope they don't cave to record company pressure and keep making music as they hear it in their minds ear.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so fun and it waste time if your on your work break or something else,but this is an awesome game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i like this game it really brings out who i am and what i like playing so that is my idea of this game seyall later
B0042J6VUS|1.0|It's too small for my HTC One X. The spring broke the first time I use it. The tripod is also not steady.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I loved it!  Non stop excitment and desireable conclusion. Riveting, suspencful with unexpected twists and turns.Todays story all over again.
0062112430|5.0|This story started out highly implausible. I was almost kind of laughing as I was reading it, like, &#34;give me a break&#34;--weird premise. However, I persevered, mainly because the writing was engaging, and as I got further along in the story, I found myself accepting the premise and moving deeper into the main character's psyche. She doesn't meet the love of her life until about a third of the way through the book, which was a little disappointing to me, as I was reading this mainly as a romance. However, the more I read, the better it got, and at the end, I was just as emotional as I had been when finishing the first Hunger Games book. Good job, Lauren Oliver! (Laurence Olivier?)
159562015X|5.0|Most people spend their lives trying to build up their weaknesses. StrengthsFinder 2.0 discusses a better approach: develop your strengths. The heart of the book, the StrengthsFinder online questionnaire, will help you identify your talents and provide guidance to capitalize on them.  Excellent.
B000N4SHOE|3.0|This is actually a tragedy wrapped in a romantic comedy box...I was looking for something light and fun, and this one made me cry and frustrated me. I don't think it was a poorly written movie at all, and the acting was wonderful, I just think that the premise -- Beatrix Potter finds love -- belies the horror ultimately depicted in her personal life. I wouldn't call this a date movie. It's like Hope Floats, where you think you are about to watch a great romantic comedy, and you sob the whole way through. Buyer beware.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read all 3 of the series and this one was my favorite! Best way to end the series in my opinion.
0756404738|3.0|About Book 1: Yes, this is the best fantasy book I've ever read, and I've read a few. Rothfuss has a talent for creating sympathy (no pun intended) for his characters, as well as believable scenarios in a fantastical world. The book had a depth of emotion that only a gifted writer can plumb. The writing is vivid and full of great imagery, and I love that the main character is a red-head. :) This is a very satisfying read, and as soon as I finished, I bought part 2. The book is also wholesome and fit reading material for your children. I highly recommend.<br /><br />About Book 2: This section starts out as intriguing and engaging as the first, and about 2/3rds into it, starts going downhill a bit. Suddenly, it seems like our hero is the luckiest man alive. He can do no wrong, and he survives things that better men haven't. The writing is still good and the characters are still sympathetic, but I'm beginning to lose that edge that comes with not being sure your hero is going to make it after all. I hope that part 3 rectifies that sentiment. Also, what's with all the sex? Suddenly Kvothe has 21st Century American values? I was more intrigued when he defied the norms.
0547884591|4.0|This book isn't just about cooking.  It's a lot about how to look at life and learning skills.  Tim's unique approach to learning skills translates into how he organizes and runs his life which is quite fascinating.  The learning a skill section was really helpful, but I also learned a few cooking skills as well.  I have been cooking for about 15 years now and I think there's always something more to learn.  I feel that Tim's writing has a lot of influence from Dale Carnegie's style and how he changes the voice of the book a lot.  Overall, its a great book, but sometimes it does lose some focus.  I would have rather him focus a lot more on learning skills because that can be translated into anything.  For less than $30, it's a steal.  Hats off Tim.
B007LNJ4YW|5.0|I went on to iTunes to find the newest Bon Iver, and I saw Beach House and liked the graphics enough to listen to &#34;Myth&#34;....wow. It captured me and I couldn't stop listening to it. I downloaded that one song, and then came here to Amazon to purchase the full CD, which turned out to be a continuation of the same sound and atmosphere of &#34;Myth&#34;. I love this music, and I can listen to it in the background while I study or read and it is not distracting or jarring in any way. I highly recommend.
B0086DBE62|3.0|An OK movie that is an entertaining take on the old fable. Julia is very good, she makes a good witch.
0613824229|5.0|For a science fiction book, I found this story to be highly emotionally satisfying. A friend had recommended it, and she said to me, &#34;The first part is a little dry. But stay with it--you will not be disappointed.&#34; That's just what I did, and I am so glad I read to the very end. WOW! The ending was unbelievably touching and sweet--I cannot emphasize that enough. The ending made it obvious why the beginning and middle were so dry, and the ending made the whole work a unified whole, and transformed a dry (but still interesting) story into a poignant work of art. Highly recommend. Also, it is appropriate for any age.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Being a big fan of Depp, I rented this movie with high hopes only to be dashed by a poor movie with no redeeming entertainment value. Beware.

B003Y74KCK|3.0|gets somewhat loose after awhile, otherwise OK it does not &#34;loose&#34; the phone's characteristics. good grip, but need to be careful
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|WOW - total enjoyment. you love horror culture, you will love this!  You do not need to see seasons in order, they are different stories and mostly same actors.  Excellent!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|def download! it is really neat. I really love it! my daughters watch this show all the time. I thought it was really cool that they can play this...FOR FREE!
B005PK553C|5.0|This is one of the best stories i have watched in a long time!  The last 15 seconds of the series totally amazed me.  Never expected that.  Great cast and captivating acting and story line. A must see for the horror enthusiast.
145210655X|4.0|This book was very cute and very relatable! I think it would make a great Father's Day gift for any Star Wars fan!
B000I8ES70|5.0|Great sequel.  Cannot wait to see the other movies. Love the concept.  Was watching the walking Dead and thinking it is a great concept, but watching the Resident Evil series tells me this concept has been around for a long time.  Love the action in this movie.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The writing wasn't fantastic (kind of reminded me of a 16 year old writing in her diary), but I guess if you look past that, the story itself is entertaining.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|That's what I think about Hunger Games. The same way we read Bradbury and other sci-fi social dreamers, this series seems so far fetched.  But the idea of taking our very best, our families, and turning them into entertainment? It's the Survivor series gone mainstream.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love this game. especially since I found the hints in the journal. way later in the game it asked me 2 dig a hole on an x. I couldn't find thettrowel tho. Help!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Not bad, but adds are annoying. Nothing beats a good game of solitary. Like the different card designs. Sound effects.are also good.
076781326X|5.0|Saw this movie as a child and thought it would be a great gift. Hopefully the quality is good and They will enjoy it.
B006C1DH92|2.0|my device will not let me download it :( :( :( :(<br />  I played it on an ipad and it was SO SO SO FUN!
B0049VZ222|5.0|My sister bugged me to watch this. I said, no way - I don't like gore. I don't like drama. But she bugged me, so I watched episode 1 of season 1. A week later I was through the whole season and getting started on season 2. Another week later, I devoured season three. So, yes, I hate to say it but my sister was right! This show is excellent! Great effects, great tension, some nice twists, complicated characters and very good acting!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|We looooooooooove Dr. Horrible and NPH! Great DVD and love the commentary musical! Huzzah Joss!! We Love You so much!
B007UUV52K|4.0|This would have been better if it had been the original artists, but it is really good with the movie cast singing the songs. I would never have guessed some of them could sing as well as they do (Tom Cruise especially). For anyone who grew up between the late '70's and the early '90's this brings back a flood of memories and you will find yourself singing along. If they ever release this same compilation with the original artists I will own it. Many of the songs on here I already own by the original artists, but there are several that I don't and I can't say there is a bad song on the entire soundtrack. A few of the performances are a little weak by comparison, but overall a great job. If you saw the movie and enjoyed it or even didn't care for it but liked the music, buy this album. It really is a ride down memory lane for adults of an age to remember these songs when they were new.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app. It seems like such a simple thing but with a quick glance you know exactly how many hours of use you have left...no guesswork involved! Another small thing but I love the custom color scheme too.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Being a fan of most of the stars in this movie, I am biased...very biased. The action is great. Lots of gun play with hits that are more realistic than I have seen before. When a human body gets hit with a .50 round, he doesn't just slump over like in the 1960's TV shows (Combat or Rat Patrol). Here we see massive gore, body parts and parts of body parts flying away. The stunt folks take the hits accurately too, none of that \\"slumping over into an eternal snooze\\" --these folks look like they were hit with a high-powered round.<br /><br />Excellent job in the hand-to-hand department, although for my money there could have been a lot more of that and a few less one liners. But I confess, some of the one liners were LOL funny! I won't spoil it here, because I detest movie spoiling. Suffice to say I am not given to laugh out loud, especially when I am alone. Some of the humor bits really were perfect!  The exchange between Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger during the big battle scene was HILARIOUS! I am shocked that Van Damme agreed to play the bad guy. He should have because in my book he is the least likeable. Just to have a movie with this kind of a cast is the very definition of EPIC. In that respect it was like The Dirty Dozen, my favorite old school war movie.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that make you saw to yourself, \\"I never thought I'd see all these great action actors together in the same movie, I am so glad this happened in my life time!\\"  I am so glad I took time out today to watch this movie. It was well worth the rental and I am probably going to buy it as well.<br /><br />And I am glad I could share a few thoughts with you as well. I hope you will watch it now. Enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Rob
B004HW7JHE|4.0|It was a well thought out season by the script writers and true to life episode. Please keep the series going.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|im not an expert...but i have bought many headphones in my life, in a pretty wide range, and i can say these are very very good for the price....even for higher priced phones...it is very good.  caveat is that running it on ipad, ipod, it needs an amp...a little one will do, but an amp is needed to bring out the potential.  its ok without an amp, but with one, i use an e6....brand not mentioned ... but very reasonably priced unit...it shines...crisp mids and his, and bass is good to great...depending on your tastes.... can be adjusted to your tastes...it ll handle all levels well.<br />buy...i recommend.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love love love this book! So well written. Great twists and turns and at the end it all makes perfect sense. Highly Recommend!
B001AUEMFS|5.0|One of my favorite songs ever, and My favorite song from Coldplay. I have been wanting to get this song for a long time.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I truly do like this app. My ONLY issue with it is that my intended purpose for this product was to simply use it as a clock, leave it on my nightstand all night so that I wouldn't need an additional alarm clock. But it seems to drain battery faster than my charger can give it power, but other than that I absolutely love this application.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It was another fast paced thriller by Vince Flynn. I get some great satisfaction out of seeing the bad guys get their due, even if it is fiction.
1585104205|4.0|Please be aware this is not a review of the content of the book but just a warning for any one purchasing to check the book carefully when you get it to make sure no pages are blank. We did not do this and now it is pass the return date and there are 8 separate incidents of blank pages near the end of the book. I am awaiting Amazons reply on this and have also emailed the publisher to see if they might remedy this. I would be surprised if our book was the only one like this so check yours carefully. Otherwise my daughters are using this book and they are doing well with it.<br /><br />Followup - reported this to amazon and they sent a new book out asap, thank you Amazon! We are off and running once again and now can finish the book!
1439152799|2.0|I actually had to skip through scads of sentences. Are you kidding me? \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" was awesome. This book with the children's book of \\"The Mud Man\\" was like books on drugs.<br /><br />Horrible. Skip it. Fell flat.<br /><br />D- grade. Sorry...you're a great author but...what happened?!

1416550550|5.0|Loved this book and I am an English major book snob. It's one of her best. Didn't like \\"The Distant Hours\\" but this one rocked. It will transport you, which is what book should do. Excellent.
B009VB97EY|4.0|Decent storyline, but more than anything, the dancing is awesome. Channing Tatum is a very talented dancer and the great soundtrack.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|This movie is beatiful to watch.  It is true to the original book.  I would highly recommend it for the whole family.  A step up from the Disney cartoon version.
B00992CF6W|1.0|why wont they make a non rip off minecraft!!!I'm 11 and I want them to make a free mindcraft like this one except you cannot save!!!I just want to play mindcraft!!!I wish they could but I doubt they'll do it.I mean when have the ever read our comments!!!!!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch does it again....... Against all odds he finds his way to Pakistan to weed out a crooked agent...gets injured....and makes peace (sort of) with the guy who killed his wife.<br /><br />Vince Flynn is always a good read.<br />It is hard to put his book down.
B003SNJYSK|5.0|He loved the book.  Didnt read it myself, not my kind of book, but it is very good according to my husband
B000YHE4AG|5.0|I have yet to meet a person that did not like this movie.  It is one of few  movies that I can watch more than once in a month without wanting to tear my hair out.  I would reccomend this movie very highly as it is appropriate for just about everyone who likes to laugh...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love all of the event of it. its just that one time when I lost my memory it was gone and I was a x30. now I lost all my coins and tricksy fresh frank tagbot Lucy and almost spike so close.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|didn't think this would be as much fun as I am having.  I am still trying to figure out what you get for puzzles you complete.  wall coin doesn't seem to count over one.  no extra time or I being impatient?
B0097EWK3A|5.0|loved.. more like it please. there is not enough of these storylined hidden object games. Haunted is also a good example of puzzle type game without a lot of heavy hidden objects.  this one was long and i absolutely loved it!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE American Horror Story Season and 1 and Season 2 so far. Story line is amazing and the characters. Totally original.
0062071017|5.0|Designers battle whether &#34;form follows function&#34;, presenters struggle with &#34;style vs. substance&#34;, and so many business leaders and managers disagree which should get top priority - &#34;Great Strategy OR Great Execution&#34;. The Strategist presents disarmingly convincing stories of failure (Masco in furniture-land) and awesome successes (IKEA, Gucci) of consumer businesses that demonstrate a leader's job is to strategize AND execute. I found the insight of real-world examples combined with visual strategy wheels intriguing and thought provoking. I highly recommend this book for anyone responsible for differentiating his/her organization from competitors, and leading a team to build a &#34;system of added value creation&#34;
1433207044|2.0|It's a rambling tale that has, for some reason, become a 'must read' classic. I found it hard to concentrate on but it did string me along to find out what eventually became of the principal characters.<br />There are five of these. Howard Roarke an architect who's an egocentric uncompromising self proclaimed genius, Peter keating who's a middle of the road architect fully aware of his limitations but quite successful ( and envious of Roarke), Gail Winart an arch typical news paper mogul who vainly assumes he can rule the world by what he publishes, Enrite Tuey a crashing bore who values only his own opinion; a person you couldn't argue with so end up agreeing with to get him out of your hair and Dominique Francone a silly (if not stupid) female who thinks she can protect her lover (Howard) from the ravishes of mediocrity by trashing his reputation and marrying his enemies. This is all in vain because Howard doesn't give a damn one way or the other; but they end up married.<br />Poor old Peter is swamped by all the quasi intellectualism and is vilified by the author for being more or less normal.<br />The story plods on page after page without achieving much until the last chapters when Howard finally releases his philosophy to the universe during his trial for burning down what he proclaimed to be an insult to architecture. However, his diatribe, although crucial to the outcome of the story (the jury release him based on this) doesn't contain anything that would be used in a book on philosophy or human enlightenment. But the author obviously thinks this is the kernel of her 'great' story. If there were any other philosophical truths lurking between the lines I failed to detect them.<br />Not in any way comparable to, say, Jane Austin for story, characterization and humanity.<br /><br />Note: I listened to an unabridged CD version of this book therefore the name spelling may be in error.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|grat seeing all the action stars of the 80's together in one movie,I recommend this anyone who likes action movies.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is a beautiful, moving set of music combinations that never fails to stir something in me.  I listen to it as background music at work,stirring yet gives a sense of peace.  I can't wait for the next CD.  These guys are really talented musicians and their videos are stunning.  I would definitely reccommend this to everyone no matter what your musical tastes are.
B0018O4YSQ|3.0|It was somewhat entertaining. It was okay. I did not think it was a movie that I would go to a theater and pay 10.50 to see.
B008QMMEOE|2.0|My 3 yr old did the first four puzzles in less than a minute and was then prompted to buy the rest.
B003UAHIM0|4.0|Loved this movie when it was broadcast on T.V. Very funny parody.Tried to watch it with my 8 year old grandson because he loves Star Wars. WAY TOO MANY swearwords in the uncensored full length version.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|This is a great CD. I have had to buy two. My mother is crazy about Jack Johnson. We love his music.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|As one of the earlier reviewers mentioned, this album is not an artistic masterpiece, nor is it groundbreaking.  What it is is a comfortable album.  In many ways that is a good thing because sometimes you don't want to spend a whole lot of time and intellectual effort listening to an album.  You'd rather just mindlessly sing along to songs with infectious melodies and above-average lyrics.  This album is like the warm, fluffy slippers you put on after  kicking off your painful, designer shoes, or the leftover meatloaf and mashed potatoes that you grab out of the refrigerator after returning home from an avant garde restaurant.<br /><br />Also, some might consider me a music barbarian for saying this, but I am not a fan of either the Dave Matthews Band or Mumford & Sons.  I find DMB's songs to be too discordant and turn them off as soon as they come on the radio.  Marcus Mumford, on the other hand, is too theatrical and self-important in his delivery for me to enjoy M&S's songs.  Having said that, I do agree that some (not all) of the songs have a DMB vibe or an M&S vibe.  However, the vibe is not so strong, otherwise I would not have enjoyed listening to the album so much.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|My husband just bought the kindle fire hd for me and he ordereed this camera from the app store, they charged us for it, but its no where on my tablet......<br /><br />UPDATE: The app popped up on my KFHD on Sunday (its magic!!), well it takes pictures, doesn't give me the option to share to Facebook only to email it or share it to skype. The quality of the picture is poor, but I think that has more to do with the device than the app itself. This app should be free, there's nothing special about it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Suits is a great show. Just enough drama. Each week keeps you watching up till the end sneaks up and you have to wait till next week. One of the best features I find in Suits is that -- it's funny! The humor keeps it from getting too heavy. It's just a clever and fun show to watch.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I enjoy reading all Vince Flynn's novels. This newest one is filled with suspense and frighteningly realistic scenes of what happens when the president of the most powerful country on earth leads from behind. I'm having a difficult time putting the book down. Can't wait for Vince's next book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn keeps injecting little surprises that make the Mitch Rapp series exciting and excellent. Rapp is a great character. I've spent many nights into early mornings waiting for him to come through one more time.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|Great movie, great music! Tom Tykwer - polymath man :) The music I want to listen again and again and again.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|This movie was horrible, that I am glad I only paid 1.99 for this crap. Oh yes, I would have been pissed if I spent an extra 2 bucks on bad acting, action, and story plot. What a waste of money!!! HOLLYWOOD stay off that stuff and make good movies.
081299471X|5.0|The book was published just fine! Wonderful dust cover, amazing cover, vintage paper, in moleskin. The book is very nice to hold in your hands, not to mention the exciting content ^ ^
1401322786|4.0|Enjoyable reading in such a short story. The future twist at the end was a great tie-in.  Worth your time.
B000FC1PFW|5.0|I like Agatha Christie mysteries. You can get lost in her books. I can read them all day long. Great for road trips
B007SGLZP8|5.0|My first book using a Kindle.  The book kept my interest.  Had a good ending.  Easy to read.  It was interesting not using a real book
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Greetings All, They really did a great job on this one. Copy is wonderful and action is great! Very happy with transaction and would buy from seller again! Cheers, William
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I enjoyed a lot of this movie but it left a bad taste in my mouth that even though he loved the girl he kept making out with anything else that looked at him sideways. Stupid.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|simple but entertaining puzzles.  too short.  finished in less than 2hours.  on a side note, why would a person take an ancient artifact from a lost city where it served a purpose and then not return it for many many years?  i would like more puzzle games like these.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|Funny, sad, beautiful and I found myself nodding my head at some statements and saying, &#34;amen&#34; when one actress was talking about her aches and pains. Loved this show.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|Making a good buddy cop movie is an art, but this movie pulls it off with flying colors. It reminds me a lot of Hot fuzz.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Loved this show. Love the paranormal mixed with history. Did not like Mary Todd's character as I've studied the Civil War and the Lincolns extensively. She was portrayed in a kinder manner in this movie than she is in the history books. Intersting ideas though.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I'm not sure what I can say about angry birds that hasnt been said already. It's an addictive little time waster.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|cannot wait for the next. constintly held your attention. great action, some humor, intense. nice to watch a movie that was not all blood and guts
B006OOHYIC|4.0|This is a great sequel to an equally great game. It maintains the challenge of the first while adding a twist that helps to keep it from feeling like more of the same.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like the game itself but there is one problem I have.  sometimes when I get on the game will glitch and reset me.  its takes a long time to get 23 hoverboards without buying them.
B003EI2EH2|1.0|I think this guy wrote this book just to hear himself talk. You could condense the useful diet stuff into three pages.<br />I'm still shaking my head trying to figure out what the author was trying to accomplish.
B000U0F7RG|4.0|Good for an entire series and shipped here on time, but disappointed that season one had two disc threes, but no disc six.
0792839749|5.0|Probably one of my favourite childhood films. It is a Christmas viewing must in my family. We watch with the song subtitle option and sing along...great fun!
0061808121|5.0|really helped the students to better understand the wording.  Then when they had a question all I had to do was stop the CD, explain the details, and start the CD.
B000007MVD|5.0|Awesome cover songs and originals done in the BBC Studio during the early 1960's before Beatlemania hit America.  Great live recodings of the Fab Four!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Pretty good app. There aren't many qualifications to make a great solitaire app, so this cokes pretty close. No mid-game advertisements to interrupt or get in the way.
B003ZEQMIC|5.0|John and Walter Houston are superb in the B&W classic. If you want a great classic movie, this is one to watch.
B008G8SFGO|2.0|Being a huge KISS fan, I of course bought the CD. OMGosh! What a mess. Great tunes destroyed by a tone-deaf sound engineer. HELLO? didn't anyone here how terible the compression was. There isn't even any stereo separation. It's essentially a mono recording. I think the Beatles first mono album had better separation...lol. Paul and Gene, do you think you could go back and re-record this album with a sound engineer that has his feces coagulated? The tunes are great. Sadly, the recording on a scale from 1 to 10 is a ZERO! 2 Thumbs down...way down! Gave two stars only because the tunes have potential with the proper sound recording and mixing. Stay away from the Monster. Oh by the way...despite what some of the other bad reviews say, I thought the album art, cover, and insert were well done.
141659521X|4.0|I have read the entire Vince Flynn series. I liked this book, and think it fits well into the rest of the book series.<br /><br />There are several typos in the kindle edition of the book.  One of the editors needs to read through the book and make the necessary corrections.
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|Bought this so my wife could record a book for our grandson.  Loved doing it and it was very reasonably priced.  Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|My kids enjoy this game.  The action of this game is very exciting.  Bring more games like this to amazon apps
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I read this book for my book club and it's one of the best series I've ever read. But beware (not a spoiler) some people will trick you throughout the books. :)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I got tired of swiping on my stock keyboard and remembered that I had this as a free app a while ago. It's easier to get the word I want and I don't have to add words when common ones won't show. I do miss swiping though but this is easier to use and really good at predicting my sentences and auto saves my silly nicknames and other words I made up.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This was a great book for me to read. I just had to keep reading until it was finished. During the book Clay learns what was really going on with Hannah before she committed suicide. It's a really beautiful and touching story.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I got this app a while back on my Kindle fire and recently for my phone. I like the color customization. My daughter liked playing around with the colors. I like that i can use the led light on my phone now as the flashlight.
193609648X|5.0|I eagerly waited for this book to be published and now that it is, I am not disappointed. It is very unusual to find a crochet book and want to make more than one or two projects, this book is just the opposite, I want to make them all!!!! It is a beautiful book, there is a nice variety of patterns which have different degrees of difficulty. The patterns are written clearly, there is more than one picture per pattern, and diagrams with some. This is one book I am happy to have in my collection. Dear Noro, when will we see your next book?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this from Kindle because I thought it looked interesting, and it did not disappoint. I had never heard of it before, but I would recommend it to anyone who loves science fiction.
0307730697|5.0|I recommend every American to read this book to better understand the importance of and purpose of our Navy Seals. When one understands the excruciating. sacrificial and pushing one's physical endurance to its limitations (reason why very few recruits are physically and mentally able to complete weeks of training) enabling the to face any dangerous mission in fighting terrorism around the world, it makes one feel safer and secure here at home. This book is well written, and hard to put down once you start reading!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|a truly wonderful app!!! I use it every night! it helps me relax and drift off to a very peaceful sleep. very User friendly!
B001GUXJQA|5.0|the style of writing just keeps getting better and better with each one of these novels.<br />really enjoyed this one because it was suspenseful without having to be gruesome.<br />great job.  I read this in two days.
0691142165|5.0|The book is overwhelming in the mass of evidence that it provides on the implications of fiscal folly - spending without limits. At first, I was engrossed in the stories. Toward the middle, I was completely convinced. By the end, I put it in my permanent collection.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book as part of a book club choice where I work.  It was really good and the ending was quite unexpected.  If you like books with lots of twists and turns, you'll love this one!
B000VLOKQI|5.0|Fills-out missing bits from The Kids Are Alright DVD.  Fairly comprehensive and the bonus disc is a delight which includes an in-the-studio look at the making of the re-worked 'Real Good Looking Boy' for their last album with Greg Lake on bass.  I have already watched this many times and remain in awe of this band and their story.  An invaluable addition to any Who fans library.
B00846REIS|3.0|Seemed like its the same story as the Grey books. Just not thrilled I guess. I did finish reading it ...not horrible.
B0081BU42O|5.0|Iain (M) Banks is one of my favorite authors, Particularly for his \\"culture\\" novels.<br />They are some of the best \\"Hard\\" but far future science fiction being written today.<br />The Hydrogen Sonata is not the place a new reader should start on this series, that would be \\"Consider Phlebas\\" or one of the other earlier novels.<br />The Hydrogen Sonata is not the best of these he has ever written, that, in my opinion would be \\"Excession\\".<br />But it is a very good typical Iain M. Banks Culture novel and I am very happy that he wrote it and that I read it.<br />Mr Banks is writing too few of these recently, concentrating more on his Iain Banks (no 'M')<br />mainstream novels.  These are good too, but I much prefer his science fiction and wish that he would write more of them.<br /><br />Mike Lukacs
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The swiftkey 3 is by far the best android keyboard on the market. Nothing compares to it! With it's incredable learning ability, most of the time I'm not even typing words anymore because it knows the next word that I want to use, so all I have to do is touch on it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My husband and I have been fighting over playing this game! I think he just needs to invest in his OWN kindle fire! LOL
0593070631|5.0|I am so thankful with them for sharing such personal and private stories about their career and themselves. Theyre being 100% honest and i love that, because that shows they really want their fans to know them for who they are.<br /><br />Ive cried, laughed and made shock faces while reading it.<br /><br />I completely recommend it, even if youre not a fan, specially if you're starting a band and wanna make it big, its like a huge guide on do's and dont's and sticking together and staying strong through it all.<br /><br />Read it and have ready your McFly playlist...
0307155102|5.0|Great to look thru with toddlers and for them to go thru alone. Enough cute humor to keep older kids enjoying it too.
B004I744AS|4.0|I really like this because I'm not good at spelling and I can just put in the word I need and it finds the correct spelling for me.  I also like the different things offered, new news, quotes,  having the word spoken etc.
B007MDB548|2.0|First, I will say this is fine for children and the graphics are charming. Howewver, for an educated adult we can see through the hype and political correctness. The overt correctness ruins it for us adults.<br /><br />The characters are not well balanced racially and in sexual orientation. They put in a Token black,Latinoe and boyish girl. This is not a real depiction of how are society is made up.<br /><br />The Latino girl is depicted with her large butt and hips and her silly speach. The Black is the typical black made palletable for white audiences. (you know the type, all white features and a slightly tinted brown complexion. One Asian and an american Indian.<br /><br />Films are supposed to be art. Not extension of the DNC.
B0009HARUW|5.0|it was a great buy at a great price very happy with book . it is a must have for any child..
0547569653|4.0|Very well documented look inside the mind of a distance runner. Really drives home the point that running long distance is more than just physical training.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|It's good. It's great. This chip rocks. Okay, so what can I say. It's a CPU. I put in a motherboard, and hey, it &#34;computes.&#34;
B007HACDLK|4.0|This writer has a way to keep the story moving. I have read all of his books and this one will keep me waiting for the next one. Good read
B008CO1DPM|5.0|Totally great. Boots Win7 in like 30 seconds. You will not be sad or disappointed if you buy this, unless you are an Apple fan because it can't run OS X. Otherwise, it's great.
0307592731|5.0|This author's ability to write so that the reader is right there in every experience with her is amazing.  I was deeply touched with feelings of joy, sadness, amusement, love and much more as I walked the miles with her on her life journey.  It became my journey by the time I got the the final chapter.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I think it would be way better without any ads other than that its perfect for entertaining children on long trips or just playing for fun.
B0091REZMW|2.0|After playing 10 minutes I find the game sorta boring. So far I have been given about 6 objects to find and spent the rest of the time reading instructions. Kind of reminds me of Clue so far. After 15 minutes nothing new yet; i just keep going between the same two rooms finding the same 3 objects in each room. This game sucks.  Plus yu need CASH o continue playing..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love Flow free! It is really fun to play and really makes your brain think. it is also super addictive! If I get stuck on a level I'll keep playing it for about three hours until I beat it. It is my new favorite game.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|since there are 1400+ reviews o this book and no one will read this, I will simply say. This book is flippin amazing and i think you should read it.
B00005JN0T|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I think they did a good adaptatioin of th novel and if it's on I will watch it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics and pleasant background music.  My little girl and I have really enjoyed playing it together, and we highly recommend it!  I'm just bummed that I can't jump down into the game environment and experience it in person.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Can't wait for volume two! Want to learn more. Really, really great book. Already made some dog leashes! Will buy your next book.
0345803485|1.0|There really is no redeeming thing to say about this book. Not well written. Overly used exclamations (Oh My!) and italicized thoughts through the female character's perspective, leave the reader having to plow through superficial silliness that truly is Fifty Shades of the same pap. I couldn't bear to read the 2nd in the series, but decided to read the 3rd when I saw it handsomely displayed at my local library....It was even worse. The epilogue is previews of coming attractions - the same story through the male character's viewpoint. Don't even go there.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A simple and fun game. You don't see too many of these kinds of games anymore. I highly reccomend it.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|This app does not work.  You put in the city you want it to show and nothing happens.  I have been unable to get it to work.  Not worth your time.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|it's great for the price  i just wish it had just a few minor key features like click feedback and landscape mode.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|I like the friendly user interface, the easy to read functions, and the quality product I'm left with after I hit save. Not as many options as picsay pro, but picshop allows you to add layer after layer to montage together. To me, picshop is tied in a neat bow and you'd be missing out if you didn't have it.<br /><br />------------------------<br />**EDIT (7/6/2013)**<br />------------------------<br />Works on Kindle, but still not working (will NOT save projects or export photos) on my Galaxy Note 2 after latest update... -2 stars until fixed!
B005ELZKWS|3.0|Not bad, quite listenable.  It is an enjoyable listen but nowhere near the early and mid career Van Halen magic.  I think their song writing is their weakest point.  I would advise the guys to work with a producer who could add value to the song writing in the pre production phase.
B003YHSE7W|4.0|great sequel with a lot of action and fun characters. can't wait for the third one to come out next year!
030746363X|2.0|Nothing I tried from his book worked for me but I found it too difficult to apply it as perscribed by his book.  His 2 hours sleep in 24 hours formula, very interesting but I could not apply it to myself.  I have my doubts about his diet and exercise ideas.<br />Maybe if you can apply it as perscribed in his book but for me it was just too hard to do.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|Snow White and the Huntsman (2012). Extended Edition. Film by Universal. Story by Evan Daugherty. Direction by Rupert Sanders. Screenplay by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock, Hossein Amini. Playacted by Kristen Stewart (Snow White), Chris Hemsworth (The Huntsman), Charlize Theron (Ravenna), Sam Claflin (William), as main characters.<br /><br />The contemporary cinematographic industry often takes pleasure in ripping both scientific and legendary history --that is, history as recounted by objective narrators who base their account on unbiased research, as well as by inspired poets who base their tale on oral traditions which, though warped, contain essential historical truth. As an example of this ferocious trend, I can mention David Franzoni's \\"King Arthur\\" (2004), directed by Antoine Fuqua, which, pretending to be the retelling of the notorious Britannic monarch's historical exploits under the light of the newest discoveries of unbiased academic research, projects a fraudulent shadow of deception which not only shatters all Arthurian legends, but strikes mercilessly at the essence of history, not just deforming it, but obliterating it in a manner that far exceeds the most garbled of legendary disfigurations.<br /><br />The Bavarian folk tale \\"Schneewittchen und die sieben Zwerge\\" (\\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\\"), compiled in 1812 by the brothers Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) and Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859), is not history. It is a fantasy which, though wrapped for children, enshrines an essence of human courage and hope, in an environment of love and hatred, honesty and deceit, where love and honesty triumph. Therefore, to retell the story dressed for adults instead of children, allows for substantial changes, as long as the heart of the tale --the triumph of faithful love under horrifying circumstances is not shattered... From its beginning, this movie promises such an adventure, and throughout most of it seems to deliver it reasonably well by the means of excellent cinematography and special effects, as well as mostly good acting, since the mediocrity of some of it does not substantially detract from the overall quality of the film. It even features a fair script (as far can be expected from contemporary cinematographic writing). But just as a single word can utterly destroy even an otherwise outstanding poem, one or two fleeting scenes can annihilate an otherwise good movie with many exceptional characteristics... Just as if, after constructing a monumental edifice of magnificent marble blocks, the architect were to remove the cornerstone, the entire edifice would collapse, so a story from which its heart --the essential quality that makes it memorable-- is removed, will also fail absolutely, even if the rest of it --cinematography, special effects, acting and even script-- were all magnificent. This is what has happened to the story of Snow White in \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\".<br /><br />This otherwise ingenious retelling of the Snow White tale has been devastated by two fleeting scenes which have obliterated the very reason of the story, its essence and heart. To be sure, the character of Snow White has been drastically changed, as she has been turned into a sort of Saint Joan of Arc and Conan the Barbarian, mixed into one, but damaging as this change is, it does not quite destroy the story. Despite the fact that it plays an important part of the movie, faithful love is ripped, minced and utterly defeated. This is accomplished in just two brief scenes --very brief, but overwhelming. Instead of exalting the power of constant love, Snow White and the Huntsman obliterates it, perhaps because it is the offspring of a contemporary society which has trampled thoroughly on true love, having lost any respect for constancy, and even the most basic understanding of it.<br /><br />What could have been an excellent story retelling, and almost was, is only and empty carcass --a hallucination which, powerfully attracting as a seeming beautiful rose, once smelled yields the putrid scent of decaying carrion.
B006UG90RM|2.0|This is not classic Van Halen.  I expected so much better of them.  If the guys really want to produce new music they need producers and a record company A&R who can tell them this sux before it gets out.<br /><br />this album leaves me wondering where has the magic of the past gone?
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Ok, the book wasn't Shackspeer, but it was fun, enjoyable. This could have been either of those, but was just a waste of two hours.
0316286850|4.0|I gave it to my daughter who had never had much interest in makeup and even less confidence.  It gave her the confidence to experiment and achieve effective looks.  Great Christmas gift for a girl.<br />I have also worked with wanna-be models.  Every one of them should read it too.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I absolutely adored her first album, and I found this to be another solid outing, that was both reminiscent of the first, but still growing, so it doesn't just feel like a re-tread.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a tricking most awesome game ever I play this almost everyday its my favorite game I love it.:)
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I have seen the original version of this movie multiple times. but when i watched this it was like a whole new movie, it was incredible. now this directors cut version is probably one of my favorite movies. I think to fully appreciate this movie one would have to watch the normal version first then this to truly grasp how much better and different it is.
B009X00E18|5.0|I have this case for my Kindle Fire 7\\" and I absolutely love it. It's strong but very thin so it doesn't add any bulk and take up more room than necessary in my purse.I was hoping I would be able to get the exact same one for my new Kindle 8.9 and ta da! They have it!<br /> Once I dropped my Kindle while reading it on my treadmill and there was no damage at all. I highly recommend this case.
B0063GORYU|4.0|3rd device and one of the first thing I do is get my spider solitiare game.  I will .<br />not even look at the regular solitaire.  This is a level better.  Very interesting.
B009FO908A|4.0|Both my 9 and 13 year old girls love anything to do with One Direction.  So it was a no brainer to order.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Like everyone I know, I've seen the various cinematic incarnations of this story (Alistair Sim, George C. Scott, and the Muppets are my favorites, in that order), but I always meant to read the story myself. And now I have. I will probably never read it again, but that doesn't mean I don't think you shouldn't read it. If only to see what liberties the filmmakers took.<br /><br />Truth be told, these free classics for Kindle are a wonderful resource we should take advantage of while they're available. I've downloaded about 20 books on my reading list. I read A Christmas Carol first because it's seasonal, plus I can't seem to find the Alistair Sim version of the film anywhere.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Goodness...I got this app yesterday, and couldn't stop for a couple hours.<br />  As both a Pegasister and fan of tycoons since this little filly can remember (as in I watched My Little Pony long before FiM existed, and is an able player of 'Zoo Tycoon', amongst others), this was a must-have for me. At first glance, I saw Pinkie Pie, a yellow FREE pricetag, and a licence from Hasbro. At that point I didn't care what in the world or above it this was.<br />  However I was disspointed this was another 'FREE' game that had you buy virtual items with real money. Nonetheless, I concluded I would simply ignore the real money add-ins and just download it.<br />  To my suprise, other than a few unneccesary things that made your game 20% Cooler (Rarity, or a toy shop for example), it's still entertaining and enjoyable to play without the Coolness. However, like anything, it ain't perfect. Small imperfections, nothing worthy of a hissy, but simply pet peeves of mine:<br />-As possibly a bigger Whovian than Pegasister, I was both extatic and upset at our Pony Doctor being in the game, but given the name 'Time Turner'. Messin' with my head canon, Hasbro.<br />-Multiple instances of the word 'Everybody,' 'Nobody' etc.<br />-The fact that non-Ponyville folk living in said district. I mean...Zecora I understand, but Celestia, Blueblood, Cadence, Shining Armour, Cherry Jubilee, Braeburn etc.?! Just...no. Dj P0N-3 is cool, though. I guess.<br />-Some of the animation. It simply doesn't fit. Mrs. Cupcake doing some sort of disco move, for example.<br />-NO DISCORD<br />-All the ponies flying. Just...no. Pegasi only. Please.<br /><br />  All-in-all, though, I guess you don't look a gifted pony in the mouth. In mostly all other regards, it's great fun. And I'm absolutely exctatic Derpy got her own quest, and cardboard box. It makes me happy to see her fly, trip, giggle and get up again, flashing her signature Derp face.<br />  I'd highly reccomend this game to any fan of Ponies, or even just cutesy stuffs. However I'd also reccomend turning the cash add-ins off, az they're unnecessary and take your money away in a flash.
B00447L4JG|5.0|This is a must-have for my video library.  Excellent story and visually stunning.  Great emotional attachment to the characters, good guys and bad guys.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|A novel and interesting idea with a very poor execution.  Mainly a gore fest with no substance and no attempt to actually fit the story into the times it tells of.
6304711905|5.0|This is a must-see movie for me every year.  Great for people who aren't into westerns as well.  Very Hollywood.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone.  It is a thriller/mystery (men will love it) and it is about complicated relationships (women will love it).  I couldn't put it down and everyone I recommended it to could not put it down either.  You will be hooked till the very last paragraph.  Amazing!
B004LWZW24|4.0|This movie has a unique story line.  It's not nail-biting scary but it is entertaining enough.  More of a psychological thriller than gore.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had not read a fiction novel for 12 years before starting this book and I could not put it down. What an awesome read.  Can't wait to start book two.
B000VZFYDC|4.0|Downward Spiral is and always will be my favorite NIN album, maybe for reasons of nostalgia or maybe because nothing can top it. That said, With Teeth is an excellently executed and equally disturbing view into the mind of Trent Reznor and his demons. Love it.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|No matter how far away or how close you sit to your ps3 this controller will lose conectivity every couple of seconds and then some days it works perfect all day long not very good when you're trying to achieve something and then it starts giving that red blinking light saying it can't read the controller do not buy.
B00A3AUGEW|2.0|When this is converted to an Audio CD I will purchase it.  I do not buy \\"down loads\\"<br />Ralph J.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Pros: Movie held my interest very well through the entire showing.  Good characters, acting was Great!  Plot was Very Good.<br /><br />Cons: Ending was a little disappointing. Felt like it should have come to more of a conclusion.  Possibly a second Movie in the works.  Had a goofy scene during the Credits as you see the rising of the &#34;Alien&#34; from the Alien Movies.  So you consider this to be a Pre-Quall to the Alien Movies.  This scene was also very funny!  But kind of made me feel like the whole Movie was a joke after see it????
B0071T5PN0|5.0|I liked most of the Van Hagar years.  It was still Eddie and Alex writing the music so it almost always sounded good.  But David Lee Roth brings a certain rawness and dare I say blues feeling to the music that has been missing.  Some people complain that some of the songs are reworked songs from the demo albums.  This is true but most Van Halen fans realize they have been doing that from the beginning.  House of Pain from 1984 was from those demo years.  As was Hang'em High and various other Roth and Hagar era tracks, so that complaint is completely debunked right there.<br /><br />She's the Women should have been the first released single, a major marketing flaw.  Most people I spoke with were lukewarm towards Tattoo but fell in love again once they heard She's the Women.<br /><br />The real groundbreaking, or should I say old school, song is Honeybabysweetiedoll.  That could have come straight from Van Halen's darkest album Fair Warning.  I'm not sure where that come from but I hope to here more of that in the future.  Dave's fast attack lyrics and the dark sound fit perfect.<br /><br />There are a few lackluster songs on the album but as a whole the album exceeds expectations for most VH fans.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved the Downton Abbey series, love the DVD set. I've watched it approx 10 times already. Bought another set for my daughter's Christmas gift. I highly recommend this series for anyone who likes Masterpiece. Makes a great gift.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is a great game... but it needs more mobs like squids... cause they are beast<br />also needs npc villages and villagers and their spawners
B008S4FZHI|2.0|This particular book is far too technical as regards the forensic detail,for the average reader. The story line is thin and alot of the narrative seems to revolve around the current personal life of the main character.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its ok but the bad reviews are kinda scaring me:) so far the game is pretty easy but I know its coming
B001VPJYZK|5.0|I was very happy with this purchase, the price was great, shipping was fast, and here I am, less than a month later, ready to start Season 6(which I already bought)! Great series!

B0002BO0HG|5.0|The more I listened, the more I liked it. Some of the lyrics are rough-edged, but the songs are strong-willed and honest.
B00003CXB6|5.0|I love all the Jurassic park movies so now I'm retina get my collection up and if very rare to find this one because they never released it
B000089QEN|5.0|Perfect casting and acting. Good script. Beautiful presentation. Distinctive music and tone. It makes other series look stodgy and dull.
B000H30B2C|5.0|When I first saw this movie I got do emotional I love this movie sooo much. It's such a classic and much cheaper on heree
0385335997|3.0|I love the book but there were about 100 pages in the wrong spot on the book! There was also pages missing altogether. I'm to sure why, but I was disappointed.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Heard about the characters and only tried a sample game before. The game is addicting and best part is that it is free. Very easy to play... all members of the family (5yrs, 9yrs, and 40yr old) can play it. Now if I can only get it back so I can read my books...
B009F1ZYCO|5.0|Fantastic Iron Maiden album and a great addition to my collection of picture disks. Looking forward to the others when released.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I liked the first two MIB, the first being the clear winner, so we rented this blu-ray expecting more of the same light comedy and fun goofiness. Instead we got one of the most fun time travel movies I've seen alongside a visual feast and a surprisingly emotional finish. For me at least this is by far the most interesting of the three films, lifted into the next level most of all by Stuhlbarg's oddly perfect moments.<br /><br />Smith and Jones are as usual vastly entertaining, and Clement is a great villain; one gets the feeling that Conchords was merely the start of what could turn out to be a truly classic career. Thompson is flawless as always but the real shock here was how Stuhlbarg took his role and added an amazing amount of depth to it, making the film even more strangely real. His smile and glittering eyes somehow make his scenes come alive in a way none of the other movies achieved.<br /><br />The script is both funny and very sharp, matched by Rick Baker's best space critters to date and phenomenal set design by Bo Welch. This movie really looks and feels like a mega-blockbuster should but also never feels pointlessly over the top like most popcorn sequels do. One of the highlights is seeing tons of ideas lifted from the best old sci-fi flicks; I saw echoes of Star Wars, Buck Rogers, Doctor Who, Barbarella, Blade Runner and so many other classics, all reimagined and retooled. There are some of the coolest gadgets here, and when set against the tight 1969 sets and cars and threads it all comes alive.<br /><br />All in all, this was the best big studio surprise I've had in a long time, and I wish I'd seen it in the theater. But it looks perfect on blu-ray, with a crisp transfer and incredible colors and black depth. There are also an hour plus of truly useful extras, in which you see that this really is all about Sonnenfeld's unique vision matched by Welch and Baker and Smith and the rest stepping up with their A-games. So this is what a big flick feels like when it all goes right!<br /><br />All in all, MIB 3 is a movie I'll gladly watch a few more times just to catch all the aliens and gadgets and colors and concepts, and above all the intelligent sense of fun that makes this one of the best third installments Hollywood has ever delivered.<br /><br />And watch out for Stuhlbarg; he sure nails his role, and if there's an Oscar for a tiny part that makes a film really click, he deserves it.e when it all goes right!<br /><br />All in all, MIB 3 is a movie I'll gladly watch a few more times just to catch all the aliens and gadgets and colors and concepts, and above all the intelligent sense of fun that makes this one of the best third installments Hollywood has ever delivered.<br /><br />And watch out for Stuhlbarg; he sure nails his role, and if there's an Oscar for a tiny part that makes a film really click, he deserves it.

B0083P1QUM|5.0|having been a Patricia Cornwell fan for many years, Her last few books have been somewhat disjointed and slow.<br />THis book puts her back on TOP!!<br />I thought It was fantastic....fast paced, interesting, and a strong comeback for  Kay Scarpetta. I felt like this book was similar to her first few Scarpetta books.
B00785P2QC|4.0|be careful....it can be addictive. i do wish the buildings were easier to find once city gets bigger because i cant remember where i built certain factories, etc.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is the best game I've played in a while.  It makes me want to dig out Myst and its sequels. To the folks complaining about the controls jusy tap where you want to go.
8866131385|5.0|Student.  Financial analyst.  Father of a child with special needs... Let's just say that my iCal gets so full that even it, is hard to read!  This is large enough that it allows me to keep everything straight on-the-go and looks professional.  Heavy construction keeps it looking great in month 15, Moleskine never fails.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Actually, there is so much raw sex in this book, it actually becomes tiresome.  And, it's a good thing there is a sequel as the ending was very indeterminate.  This would have been a better love story, actually, without so much kinky sex.  AND, I HATED it the first time he spanked her (and hated HER for allowing it), and I really couldn't stand it when he spanked her with a belt later.<br />In spite of how good looking he was (which she claimed, over and over) he was obviously one sick cookie.  Must say, I'm intrigued to find out details of WHY he was that wayl
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good game. I play it all the time. I'm completely addicted to it. I would give it five stars but the newest update is glitchy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|addicting little game. like those stupid machines but with out losing all your money. &quot;FREEDOM IS A STATE OF MIND THAT NO STATE CAN TAKE AWAY FROM YOU!&quot;
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like the fact you can download your own music to wake up to. The volume starts at a low level so you are not jolted out of bed!
1594203334|5.0|I read this book while expecting my first baby and absolutely loved it.  It was really important to me to have a child that sleeps well, eats well, is polite, and can roll with things.  Many of the things/parenting styles in this book were things I was planning on doing anyway - but the tips on how to actually pull them off were helpful.  A few times over the early month's of my son's life, I went back and re-read the sections that were pertinent to the stage he was in.<br /><br />I'm the last one in my group of friends to have a baby, but I would definitely give this as a gift to any young expecting mother or father.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|The blu-ray looks incredible, sounds astonishing, and delves deep into the production with its extras.<br /><br />The movie itself? I'm truly amazed by how divisive it has become, but it's understandable. I love the film, but I acknowledge that the scope of the film and the performances of Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace are hurt by some bizarre writing choices involving characters doing unimaginably stupid and out-of-character things for horror-movie convenience.<br /><br />People seem to think this movie sucks because it doesn't answer questions. However, I'm extremely happy it doesn't. For the first time in years, a large-scale film treats its audience like adults and refuses to spoon feed us exact answers to the large questions it poses. Those are for US to decide for ourselves, for US to contemplate. For that I am thankful.<br /><br />Despite the shortcomings, I enjoyed the film very much from a contemplative sci-fi and entertainment movie standpoint. I suggest people see it, but be sure to rent before you buy. After all, whether or not individuals like this movie is very hard to predict.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Finished this book in a day. Long story short. It was absolutely amazing. The twists and turns and ups and downs this book takes you through will definitely leave your heart pounding. I cannot wait for the next book to see where else Gideon and Eva will take me.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I know, I know. As my title suggests, I pretend the fourth movie doesn't exist. It's a divisive issue which I will not delve into here. To each their own.<br /><br />I'll just say this: The first three movies are still amazing and they look better here than ever before. Haven't looked at the fourth, I imagine it's the same as whatever it's original bluray release looks like.<br /><br />There is also a ton of extras to sort through. If you're an Indy fan, you really can't say no to this set, it's worth the price.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This game was sufficiently hard to be challenging but not so hard that you got fustrated. I was trying to find the sequel to this game but have not found it yet. Hopefully it will come out for Kindle soon.

I have the journal extension for iphone which is great!
B00316DDUE|5.0|The video and audio quality of this is great -- I own the Acropolis concert in DVD, although I love that concert, the audio and video quality of this one is way much better than the Acropolis.<br />Yanni's music is always very inspiring and the musicians are wonderful -- I especially love the duel between the saxophone and violin.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|La réalisation en 3D du film et la possibilité de le regarder comme tel donne une toute autre vision de celui-ci.<br />Il y a beaucoup de détails qu'on ne peut voir autrement et cela rend le film encore plus impressionnant.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|I just cancelled my preorder after realizing this digital copy does not offer an itunes option. I do not want multiple eco-systems and will continue not to buy when forced.
6305428042|5.0|Hocus Pocus arrived sooner than I expected and played with no skips. There were no scratches on the DVD, so I was perfectly satisfied with the product.
B000008JI1|5.0|this was a great album. Even though its not as fun  as the others it has great songwriting and great music. Just cause it doesnt sell doesnt mean its not good such as the scorpions face the heat album..also their best stuff.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack White is amazing and it shows on this album.  He is so original that you can't help but like what he does and respect him for it.  I love every single song on this CD and would recommend to everyone!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought this book very good.However I finished it in 45 minutes. I tought it was funny when Greg talked about his life when he was in his mother's stomach.I rate this book 4 stars I just wish this book was longer.
B009GESJH2|4.0|Mirror is my favorite song on this CD.  I'm not fond of some of the songs, but Mirror makes it worth every penny!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|the quality is great, the price was just right, and the movies are amazing. i got these movies during the black friday special and I'm glad i finally go them.
B002ZG999U|5.0|To have all of the &#34;old&#34; actors in this movie is fun and very enjoyable.  I had a great evening watching this movie with family and friends.  Thanks for a great evening......
B006LSZECO|2.0|I must have missed something in this book?  The concept of switching who is speaking in each chapter was ok and the only thing that kept my interest.  This book in a train wreck in print...was happy to see it end,  even if the end was inconclusive.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the individual movies and now they are all together.  The action never stops and It is very enjoyable to watch all of these characters interact with each other.  Love it...
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love Mumford and Sons and then I bought it on vinyl and my ears cannot thank me enough. .
B0096HIEE2|3.0|I did enjoy the acrobatics of the guys when they were dancing.The movie had a poor story and it was quite boring. Magic Mike does have some well known actors.  I think that they could of left out the drug use shown too. I was disappointed in the movie.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I liked all the elements around this book and it definitely kept my interest but at the end I was a bit disappointed as I felt the plot became more and more far-fetched. Sloan isn't alone in having trouble pulling strands together in this type of plot-I have criticized Dan Brown as well. That said, the characters well well drawn and the juxtaposition of the old book world with the new hi tech media/ Google and reminds one that the innovations of the past we just as mind- blowing then as today's are now. I look to more from this author!
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire HD, but it won't load the game. I'm very disappointed since the reviews were good for playing this.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Lost 35 lb from 190 lb in 3 months. Keep my ideal weight since then. The theory appears to be correct in my case and my friend's.<br /><br />I was not a meat-lover. In fact, I was almost a vegetarian. But I followed the diet after seeing my friend lost a lot weight following the theory. It started working right away and and can see the weight I lost was mostly the fat because I can see my muscle coming back out again that was once covered by the fat tissue. I didn't completely stop eating carbs. I just eat less than I used to and be very conscious about eating carbs. I also eat a lot of salad and vegetable that has low carb.<br /><br />I think the general perception of counting calories to prevent gaining weight is really misleading. The thing to be counted in our diet is carbs, not calories.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this game downloaded fine to my kindle. I love games where you have to figure it out and this one fits the bill - love searching for clues and finding the answers - the map layout leaves me running in circles at times,  it reminds me of the quest parts of zelda (without having to kill off the bad guys) very happy to have gotten this as the faotd!! not sure of the replay value in this but would be willing to spend .99 for this.
B00156ZWV0|5.0|When I first saw this item, I was sure that it was mistake of some sort. Happily, you really do get 30 CDs full of VW's entire oeuvre of 34 hours worth for the listed $$$.

These are all English performances that have appeared one time or another on the Angel/EMI label.<br /><br />With so many CDs, just a complete listing of the recordings would be too long.

These are performed by Sir David Willcocks and the Choir of King's College, Cambridge.<br /><br />OPERA?<br />Many people do not even know that VW wrote operas, much less 4 of them:<br />** Hugh the Drover (Sir Charles Groves)<br />** Sir John in Love (Meredith Davies)<br />** Pilgrim's Progress (Sir Adrian Boult)<br />** Riders to the Sea (Meredith Davies)<br /><br />...AND BALLET<br />** Old King Cole (Hickox)<br />** The Wasps (Stewart)<br />** Job: A Masque for Dancing (Boult)<br /><br />TID BITS<br />** at least ¼ of the discs are music that I have never heard or even heard of (including a plethora of songs and chamber music)<br />** there are 3 different versions of Serenade to Music<br />** 2 different versions of the piano concerto<br />** 2 different arrangements of the English Folk Song Suite<br />** it has a small booklet, but it only lists CD content: no essays, program notes, or libretti<br />** Boult also recorded a complete symphony cycle, but it is not included here<br />** part of the last CD has some rehearsal cuts from Boult<br />** there are many hidden gems in this boxed set<br /><br />APPROXIMATE DISC COUNT BY MUSIC TYPE:<br />symphony  6<br />opera  7<br />major orchestral 5<br />major choral 3<br />chamber orchestral 3<br />chamber choral 6<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br />I have only listened to a few discs, but they are a true joy.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Really liked this book! It was the first book I tried on my kindle app on my ipad and loved it! I could not put the book down. I wanted to keep knowing more. Big Nicholas Sparks fan, I love his books. Can't wait to see the movie to see how it compares, sometimes the movie versions are a hit or miss.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|Price was fair for MH doll. And the doll is great & my daughter was extremely pleased. Keep up the good work.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Entertaining story.  Interesting concept, but I felt the climax was a letdown compared to other Reacher novels.  No matter, though, like all of his followers, I look forward to his next adventure
B009SQQRH2|5.0|i really enjoyed the movie.Liked the care that Arthur felt for the little girl and that no child should be left behind. Lots of funny things made me laugh and a tear or two at the great ending.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen, sad that it ended before it had a chance. I highly recommend this series to anyone.
B005AERS74|5.0|love it love it great driving and hooping music....I'm new to the downloading stuff and although i've heard some stuff by maroon 5 I didn't know much.  great cd!
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Being more of a classic rock listener, I have to say Phil<br />Collins rocks in his own sort of way. Very enjoyable. Good tunes.......
B005SZAEYO|5.0|AHS....is one of my favorite shows.  I've been following it from the beginning on FX Channel, I recently been watching the second season.  So far season one remains the best one.  However, season two has been interesting and creepy.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Take every arcade video game you played as a child and combine them like a mad scientist and then give it a modern twist - that's Velocispider.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Martin really has an adventure, which we all do share in this fascinating event,<br />which could happen... maybe it already has.... ?
B004J4WKTW|4.0|It was easy to lose myself in these pages, as easy as it was to get lost in the circus.
B004I744AS|5.0|As someone who used to read the encyclopedia for entertainment when I was younger I love this app! Home page changes daily and features trivia, quote of the day, this day in history, birthday of the day. Stretch your vocabulary with games such as hangman, synonym match, among others. Great as a dictionary too.
0425264351|5.0|This was my first Lee Child book and it was such an easy read.  I couldn't put it down now I'm on to #2.
B0047WJ12K|2.0|All I saw was buffering a little circle going around and around. Won't order any more videos from any one any more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I did not want to finish the book because I knew that I was going to have to say good by to characters that I felt that I had gotten to know. I would have been happy to have several more book in the series. Great reading and very fast moving plot. Good by to my friends and I do hope you will somehow make a return sometime in the future
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|[POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!!]<br /><br />The first thing that you'll notice when you start watching this movie is the eye catching visuals. It is beyond what words can define. At first it might look like it was made on computer. But its not. Yes, the whole thing took over 7 years to draw with artists drawing each frame individually. Considering the amount of things happening on the screen at any given moment, its beyond my belief that how in the world they actually managed to do that. I mean this looks even better than Akira and even now by today's standards, Akira is no slouch when it comes to hand drawn Animation.<br /><br />But it seems like they put so much effort into the animation that they forgot to put a decent coherent story to assist the gorgeous visuals. I mean its not bad, its just could have been better and the characters could have been more developed. The story revolves around the titular RedLine, a dangerous winner takes all Race that is held every five years. The main character, JP, a happy go lucky with one strange strange hairstyle ends up qualifying for the race, despite failing to finish the qualifying race for the Redline. There's a possible love interest in the form of Sonoshee, who JP knows from his early years but she for some strange reasons doesn't remember him at all. There's your usual bunch of anime archetype characters, the gruff with a heart of gold mechanic, the evil scheming government officials, the tough but respectable rival racer and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />But that's not the point. The point is the race itself and boy its something. Its Twisted Metal on Steroids. The car designs are very original and downright strange. From a female transformer-esque robot/car to bug shaped vehicles, its pretty wild. Only the main character's car actually resembles a car.<br /><br />Another aspect of the story that gives the movie so many opportunities of mayhem is the fact that the race is being held on aplanet ruled by a military government and they don't want their secrets to be revealed. So they basically throw their entire might to stop these racers. From planes to biker robots to another Akira-esque monster. Heck, there's even a scene where a giant orbital laser beam is used to destroy the aforementioned monster. (Wait, am I reviewing Akira or Redline?)<br /><br />I've seen it both on Blu-Ray and on DVD and if you're thinking of buying it, go with the Blu-Ray option if you can. The visual fidelity is far superior than to that of the DVD and well, it just looks really really good. There aren't much in terms of special features, besides an hour long making of. Which isn't as interesting as you might think. Its basically the writer and the director talking to each other about how the movie came out to be and what took so long. I mean its nice but you wish you could see more, like the animation process, how the voice dubbing worked etc. But that's just me.<br /><br />So that's about it really. Its a very simple to watch and understand movie with some of the best visuals you'll see for a long time and i'll say this, American animation studios should really take a look at this and see where they are going and where Japan is going in terms of sheer visual style. Amazon has it for $14.99 which isn't a very bad price if you were skimping out on it due to the price. A well worth movie to showcase that new HD TV that you just bought on Black Friday :D.
B000T433CO|4.0|The Holiday has become one of my &#34;must see&#34; Christmas movies, like Bridget Jones Diary.  I think the acting is good, and it always leaves me with a good feeling.  The music soundtrack is excellent!!  In fact, its so good, that I looked up the movie credits online to find out who the composer was.<br /><br />  It's a Wonderful Life, is my 5 star movie, and has been since I first saw it many years ago.  I only have a couple in that category, and Home Alone is one of them, because I like to watch it with my family.  However, I liked The Holiday from the first time I saw it, and it's the kind of movie that I don't mind watching over and over again.  I never get tired of it..  Like I said, the music is awesome!!
B005P89F1C|5.0|i've never been a huge justin bieber fan but i really love this cd and so do my kids. surprisingly the drummer boy has become one of our favorites
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Although this film takes place in a mental ward of a hospital, it is really quite funny and uplifting.  Each patient in the film is portrayed in a way that highlights the humor in their situation.  Really perfect in casting these people.  Particularly, the Egyptian guy, the black schizophrenic, and the Hasidic Jew who took too much acid, etc.<br /><br />As you can imagine, with the crazy mix of characters (and Zach Galifianakis being one of them), this is a great comedy.  If you liked Little Miss Sunshine, you'll like this one!  Highly recommended.
B009UMTMKS|2.0|Blank's book contains nothing that will be news to seasoned startup entrepreneurs and VCs. It's not up to the hype.<br /><br />The book is aimed at startups that eventually will seek VC cash. It expects a startup to have a board of directors, and sneers at so-called \\"lifestyle\\" businesses. Blank disparages businesspeople in what I take to be a crass play for popularity among his geek audience.<br /><br />Overall I cannot recommend it as a primary text, although it's fine to read in accompaniment.<br /><br />My credentials: successful VC and software company founder.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I play this game daily but I just had to uninstall the game and reinstall. overall it is fun but it should be updated periodically.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|this is a great dvd to finish up the collction of harry potter movies. the blue ray dvd has special features that are greatto watch. price was great, too.
B000I186FW|5.0|one of my moat favorite movies. I love the story line and if you never watched it your missing an amazing movie.  I bet you can't watch it only once.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I am having a birthday today!<br />I love to have a birthday party!<br />I love you!<br />love adison  grace raby<br />I am 19
0345803493|5.0|these are wonderfully written and cannot put down books they are not just about sex as i had previously been told
B0035JRVBO|5.0|This is one of those movies that you want to see again and again. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  It will move you through the gut-wrenching pain of war and personal loss toward the hope for a better tomorrow.  This movie is about the triumph of one human spirit, against great odds.  It will inspire you.
0345803507|5.0|these are wonderfully written and you cannot put them down,it is not just a sex book as I was previously told
6305128952|5.0|Although we wouldn't recommend this movie for younger children, it tells a warm and endearing story about a girl and her horse and the tragedy they shared but overcame together.  Grand scenery, great acting and a very good story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is amazing. It passes time. It is fun for little ones. The reason I gave it a four star is because all of the ads after playing a game other then that this app is perfect the games are fun to play and easy.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Kept me excited till the end. Pretty sweet ending too. If you are a fan of Liam Neeson, this is definitely a great purchase for you. I absolutely loved him in Taken and this movie is right up there along with it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  John Green has a great way of weaving his words together to make it a can't put down book.  The topic is a little upsetting.  Cancer is not usually a good read but I found the book wasn't really about cancer but about relationships during a difficult time.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|Wonderful story with well thought out magic system, excellent characterization & beautifully written prose. A must for any lover of fantasy fiction.
B00026ZG10|5.0|Who could forget the transformation of Jamie Lee Curtis from frumpy housewife to undercover hooker in that hotel hallway?  OMG!  It's better to have this show and not need it than to need the show and not have it.  I can't remember enjoying the tango, Tom Arnold and truth serum in any other movie...its just great fun and highly recommended as an addition to your library!
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Excellent novel with gripping story, loads of cultural references & good characterization. I reread this immediately after finishing it. Best book I've read in a long while.
B009CPES4I|3.0|Sad to see the patronizing presentation of the local Indians. Too slapstick for my taste. I expected better from this cast.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|\\"This tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within. The musical growth of this band cannot even be charted. They are treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry.\\" Marty DiBergi, This Is Spinal Tap<br /><br />I listened to some samples on Amazon, very cliche not﻿ as bad as Sonic Boom. IMO, Love Gun is their last great album.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Right when I got my kindle fire, I was looking for this exact app, but I couldn't find it, so I gave up looking on the Amazon app store. But right now, when I was browsing through apps, I found this! And to anyone who says this is too much... maybe you should get into the game more before rating it.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|The movie was alright but definitely not great.<br />The viewing quality was horrible. We got HD thinking that it would be better but it was not properly formatted for wide screen and the picture was not good. We have gotten other movies via Amazon Prime on our TV before and since and all others look great.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|One of Grisham's better novels lately- fast-paced with some twists and surprises.  Would make a great movie!  It's a fast read.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|it a great game but runs slow on my devises. but other then that it is a great game and fun at that
B009VSW15Y|1.0|The camera is not hidden at all if you go to the homepage, scroll over to photos, there is a camera button on the right under the battery symbol.  That is the camera, it is not hidden at all.  This app is a scam
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Beautifully written saga of a man walking the length of England in an effort of self-redemption.  The Characters were expertly drawn and you felt you knew them.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|a true tradition at Christmas. outlandishly funny and a must see and re-see. The griswalds are the &#34;typical&#34; family at christmas
B004SUWR2C|4.0|drags a little but is okay. Well worth the price over the free app I was using. Good for passing time.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Awesome! I loved when she became a vampire and now i can read the whole entire series again!:)  go twilight (lol)
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|What an amazing journey!  I love this book and am going to recommend it to my daughter. Makes me wanna go for a long hike.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I'm hoping the first three books in this series are released soon here in the USA as I find the character Harry Hole to be one of the best I've read in crime fiction.  This latest from Jo Nesbo is as advertised, a real page turner. Highly recommended.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|nice to play a game with a good mix of things to do and it has some longevity to the storyline.
030758836X|2.0|At my sister-in-law's recommendation I read this sorry piece of fiction. Not only do I have to see her tomorrow, she'll ask me about this disappointing read.  This could have been a great book the structure and topic had real potential. In fact, I know a couple where the woman was just short of being Amy in her sociopathic manipulations that almost killed her husband so the plot is very believable. Flynn's voice and lack of respect for her audience plagued this book.  Flynn couldn't seem to stop herself from cheap cliches (Jaqueline Collings ~ ridiculous!) and over-done characterizations that last clear to the you-figure-it-out ending. It seemed Flynn was trying too hard to be clever and instead of being intriguing, she was annoying. Lastly, the abundant use of parenthetical statements drove me nuts.  For example: \\"They say it is important for Nick and me (the correct grammar) to have time to heal.\\" If Flynn thought the use of a zillion parenthetical statements enriched the characterization or scene setting, she missed the mark or has dreadfully poor editors. It is clear that Flynn has market acclaim, which is an achievement. Again, the story had real potential, but was ruined by Flynn's lack of restraint.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a heartwarming story. I enjoyed watching the characters grow and mature.  I would recommend this book to anyone
B006AZZPCM|4.0|the app is good ive read at the bottom that has to many porn ads I haven't seen any but I didn't update either
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This book come nowhere near the excellent story telling and character development seen in the other books of the series. It has plot twist after plot twist which, rather than keeping you on your toes like in previous books, just makes the whole thing read a little like an overdone soap opera. So much of it is just not believable given the characters' personalities and experiences up to this point. It's not *bad*, but it is really quite average and therefore disappointing. That said, his later books are once again exceptional, and it is 100% worth the work of reading this book to get to the others. It's not going to be the most engaging read ever, but don't give up!!
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|This album is Everything I hoped it would be. Acapella music at its finest combined with Christmas? Who could ask for more.  :)
B000BISBDY|5.0|Johnny at his greatest! It was definitely a great purchase, and his best greatest hits album. If you love Johnny Cash, buy this album!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a hard one to put down!  Totally enjoyed. Looking forward to next book. Highly recommend to readers of all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have this app on my phone and Kindle fire, but my Kindle Fire has not updated to the Santa and Rudolph
B003O86FMW|3.0|If your reading this book, then you have read the first. This book does not work without the first and is only a prelude to the next. Don't buy this book without buying the third.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I bought the book, I was just going to skim through it because I had to get ready for work.  I COULD NOT put the book down!  E L James writes very well and describes everything so well.  A very great read!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is more like the original Grisham works.  Great story line with a few twists that you know are coming but just can't quite see them.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Great story.<br /><br />Excellent.  Will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. Liam Neeson is awesome in this role.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Loving this application. It's so nice to have my notes available from all of my devices. The ability to have multiple notebooks to organize my notes by category is a nice feature too.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am really enjoying this series.  It  has unexpected turn all the time.  I like the fact that it keep me guessing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it but didn't like to be left hanging without the next book; however, I think it will be awesome introducing new things into my sex life ;)
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game. Is easy to play. The only problem is the advertisment that pops out everytime I want to play. I don't know how to get rid of them. I just want to play.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Okay - so, I saw this show on Broadway and it was absolutely amazing. Great cast, great energy and a really enjoyable night.<br /><br />This movie is none of those things. Terrible cast, dreadfully boring and ridiculously cheesy. Don't do it. You'll never get back that time of your life.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Like all of Ken Follett's books, this one is hard to put down.  Its story moves along rapidly and I am gently fed some history lessons as well.  Good combination, great writing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a good game it has more than 100 games it it is a good time waster.it is good over all.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|So many things about this movie just could have been soooo much better.  The spacial effects were great.  The characters just needed a bit more depth.  The actors did a great job, i just don't think they had enough to work with.  I wonder if a directors cut would be what is needed - just felt like there was something missing.
B003Y5H5JM|4.0|The acting is quite good.<br />I found it very entertaining and not dragged down by the thick fast language of the traditional play.<br />Prospero is substituted by a woman, instead of a man - but what a woman! Helen Mirren!<br />The sets are breath takers. Filmed on locations in Hawaii and else where...
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|As a red neck country girl whose family really did run shine it was entertaining but not really authentic.  Wish Forrest would have quit mumbling, didn't hear half his dialog.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|I never owned the dvd, but this bluray is glorious. dvd version isnt much cheaper so i saw no reason not to get bluray. u wont be disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I couldn't stop playing it.  The only problem I had was figuring out the rules, then I couldn't stop Playing.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|From the very start this book has you interested. Research around habits are discussed from all angles. Great stories, and amazing findings.
B004A8ZX28|1.0|This was at total disappointment. Liam Neeson, a wonderful actor but this will leave you feeling like you wasted 2 hours ...a total skip, other reviews give the plot, but just skip it .
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it. Cant wait to read the next one.  Such an interesting plot. Very original. Need to checkout other books by this author.
B00005N6KG|4.0|This is my third or fourth pair of these headphones. As other reviewers have said, they do not last long. A pair may last a year or sometimes only a few months when one side of the phones will lose sound or the sound will go in and out. I continue to buy them because ear buds do not fit in my ears, or fall out when running. It's annoying. These headphones are comfortable, produce great sound for my purposes, do not fall out, and are really inexpensive. If 10 bucks last me a year, then it's money well spent.
B008KE3960|4.0|got this for my fire hd on a whim. took a little while to get into it but it is curiously addictive and relaxing whilst keeping your interest.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very Adicting, fun. wish acorns were faster to earn as it makes it difficult to get things with out buying them. to progress faster you have to buy. it would be a 5 with out that.
B005LAII0I|4.0|Pretty good movie. Different view point that the Disney version. Can recommend to all ages as it had no extreme violence or sex or bad language.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|I love this album!! I've been listening to it everyday since I got it!!! You have to have this in your collection if you are a Rihanna fan.
B0053O89JM|5.0|My husband & I will miss House. This was an excellent ending to the series. Very good acting. I enjoyed the return of several characters that have been gone from this excellent series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you like movies about how the normal citizen would handle survival in the apocalyptic afterworld of zombie ridden American wasteland then sit down, strap in and hang on...this one is a doozey! Although we don't seem to understand how everyone's clothing is being washed or just exactly how the survivors are maintaining protein levels high enough keep their Hollywood physiques in shape but we do get a look at the types of stresses normal everyday people go through when iPhones and Netflix is permanently gone...oh yes and also when millions of the undead are roaming the planet!<br /><br />It's a gore feet though so no kids allowed!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|We really enjoyed watching the continueing story. I cannot wait for the next season to come out. We are OTR drivers and cannot be in front of the tv to watch these shows when first or this series would be on the top of the do not miss list.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I enjoyed this realistic novel because of the suspense throughout. and the great details re workings of a spy agency.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Good blend of action and scifi. My husband has watched this movie over and over. He is not the kind of guy who would do that unless he really liked the movie. I also enjoyed it both in the theater and on dvd.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever! I play it every single day. I think its also nice for people that have facebook because you can get extra points. hope you love it!
B0088X7YMS|3.0|Good animation. Definitely not what we expected but it was a decent movie. Wish it had been real actors instead of animation. The campy feel of the original does not translate well in animation.
B00338QENI|4.0|This book was well researched and well written.  It went on a little too long but the information and the general story was intriguing.  Henrietta Lacks deserves to be recognized.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app! I use it every day. It is so easy to use. More background colors would be nice and so would more font colors. Other than that it is just great!
B00425S1H8|4.0|Works great on Window's 7. Just install and use.<br /><br />I bought one to communicate through with serial with a micro proccesor, to a terminal, and I needed to be able to adjust the baud communication rate.<br />This fit the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Only con is that the screw terminals get in the way for certain connections, but I was able to modify the destination DB9 terminal in my case to use this device.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I read it twice back to back, because I didn't want the &#34;magic&#34; to end. I felt very happy & attuned to the Universe during my journey. We should all be very grateful for the little things every single day, I am! Go ahead pick it up....you'll be glad you did!
8866131059|5.0|I absolutely love this little planner. It is not very big but for me just the right size. It holds a lot of information and can be placed in my handbag or my briefcase. I will be  giving some away this year and Xmas gifts.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|Sometimes Pixar really comes up with a great story... We watched this film the day after Thanksgiving (Wife, Mother, Step-Father, Daughter(3 years old), and me.<br /><br />We all loved it, it even made my Mother cry... :) My little girl found a couple parts to be a bit scary, but she loved the movie and has already re-watched it a few times.
0307961443|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. An aging butler who has served a family of quality his whole life long looks back over his life as he takes a journey to meet someone from his past.  His style of speaking is elevated, which is a delight to read.  The book itself is wistful with a slowly building tension as this man approaches self-awareness.  Highly recommended.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Loved it! This movie was really great and the instant streaming was awsome, first time using it and it was very easy to navigate.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|One of my favorite shows right now. The cast is amazing, it's probably one of the best shows on tv right now. Love it! Can't wait for season 3!
B0032KLAKE|5.0|I watched this with my boyfriend the other night and we both thought it was amazing! We've even recommended it to other people to watch. Both Richard Gere and Edward Norton were incredible in it. Honestly, I don't know how some people thought the ending was predictable, neither one of us saw what happened coming but that made it even more amazing. It was a really good movie, I'd definitely watch it again!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince tends to confuse me with his similar character names; but this was not the case with The Last Man.  Couldn't put it down<br />and true to form......was not disappointed.  When's his next novel?
B006XF5BTG|5.0|To go from the point of no knowledge in weightlifting or bodybuilding, this book provides a good solid and detailed plan to get started, with a lot of good additional information.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Not to say it was terrible, it had funny parts, a decent story, and good acting for the most part; the thing that kept me from enjoying more of it was the incessant subliminal suggestions that are wrought in everything I've seen out of hollywood as of the past few years (more than before anyway). The the spin-off references to esoteric information.. general corniness and unnatural quality of interactions between people.. you can go on about how I should lighten up and it's only a movie, but I enjoy movies w/ thought-provoking themes & substance with at least some metaphoric resemblance to real life.. this is in suit with more of the watered down, 'appeal-to-everyone,' cliche present in much of the media now. I still thought Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and the rest delivered great performances, and it was entertaining aside from the aforementionables.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Just getting started, but this is a wonderful book! Just as I would expect from John Grisham. I love every book he has written. And I will read every book he ever writes.
B001AUEMFS|4.0|My children wanted this one for their play lists, and it's a fun song to listen to.  Now our daughter is learning to play it on the cello.
1475143389|4.0|This book plots out an easy to follow change in life that could also make a big change in  you.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|Told my children to read this book a couple of years ago, and they said they weren't interested.  When my daughter finally picked it up, she couldn't stop until she had read the whole series.  She finally talked her older brother (14) into reading it, and now everyone is hooked.
B00006HBUB|5.0|Great price great quality. My son loves this movie. It was shipped and arrived on time just in time for Christmas :)
B002ZNJXP8|5.0|I just re-read the Right Stuff and I found myself thinking that in this age of cut-throat politics and CIA directors caught in trysts, how important it is that we should still have national heroes. The astronauts of the Mercury program may not have been perfect, but their heroism speaks for itself. And Wolfe's writing style is unmatched. I cannot think of a better writer to emerge from the New Journalism movement. The Right Stuff is clearly his best work.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I've tried this game on my smartphone first, but everything moves better on my Kindle Fire.  Fun casual game!  I love My Little Pony!
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I was 10 years late to the \\"Firefly\\" series...and then gorged myself on the delightful mix of science fiction and western memes, dark humor, subtle social commentary and comic=book violence of the 14 available episodes in a weekend.<br /><br />Question 1: Would this movie stand alone without being prefaced by the series ?<br /><br />Answer 1: Yes. But but treat yourself to the series first.<br /><br />Marginal spoiler alert:<br />The family member who turned me on the series warned me about the movie: \\"Don't watch it! Characters you like will die....\\"<br /><br />And while this is indeed true, carnage does not befall the entire crew, so the finality is not wholesale.<br /><br />This story focuses on the Alliance's interest in River's special skills, and the Alliances desperate ploy to cover up the truth about the origin of the Reavers. As the plot unwinds, you get to enjoy all of your favorite Serenity crew members doing what they do best. And the do this with fun doses of action and crisp, clever dialog.<br /><br />This is what you need to bring your \\"Firefly\\" experience to closure...
B0070NSPCU|4.0|This book looks like its the start of a good series. Some of the ideas are off shoots from the three hundred. IE: beat when caught steeling but not for steeling. Let's see some more.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I wasn't that sure about this latest work of Follett's after Book 1.  But Book 2 was much more like what I've grown to expect from this author.  I'm hooked now and can't wait for Book 3.  Well done, Ken!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book can't wait to read part 3.  Once I started reading couldn't stop. Loved The plot and twists the 2nd book offered
B008XJM8M8|5.0|This package is really cool, it includes the 1972 calendar and of course the 8 strong cuts that made this the Alice Cooper album which made them the visionary  hard rock band to deal with in the early seventies.  Nice finally on 180 Gram!!!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Me llegó sin ningún contratiempo, funciona a la perfección. No tengo ninguna queja con respecto al producto. Completamente recomendado. No viene con el cable USB para conectar al PS3.
B007B5EDEG|1.0|what a disappointment the first five books great what a read what happened to the final 2 now there is no ending no finality just an unfinished story just like the books the sovereign of the 7 seas bloody disgracefull
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a must-read book for anyone who loves dystopian of post-apocalyptic fiction. The world Howey has created is detailed, robust, and intriguing. It moves fast, has characters who are believable and who you want to care about and a \\"fight\\" that feels like a worthy cause you'd want to invest in.  All around fantastic book.  I can't wait to read what comes next.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a nice app for weather as long as you have a WiFi connections, which is not always possible. This is for the weather geek in all of us.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Shinedown is the first band in a while that realy made me say wow!  All the songs on Amaryllis are awesome. They are one of the few new bands that I would love to see live because they can realy play and sound awesome live.  If you do not have this CD, you have to get this one. This is the kind of CD that you can listen to every song and want more.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|This DVD pack comes with a Digital copy code that you can use for a Ultraviolet copy or a I-toons copy of the movie in the box. I managed to be able to use the code 2 times one for I-toons one for Ultraviolet so I am happy.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|If you love Jane Austin (I do), you will enjoy this book.  Her usual kind and affectionate look at the values and manners of the day.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This is a fascinating, enjoyable read. I read mostly fiction and don't consider myself a history buff, but I couldn't put this book down. The anecdotes are entertaining and rich in interesting details. They paint vivid pictures of relationships between past, current, and future /incoming presidents. Some of my favorite takeaways: (1) many presidents go to great lengths to remain on the scene after leaving office, for various reasons ranging from noble to narcissistic; (2) leaders in different parties can not only get along- they can be true friends and work together to solve important problems; and (3) some of the relationships between club members developed and changed in surprising ways over the years. Even (perhaps especially) to the politics-weary reader, I highly recommend this book.
B008OHV4PG|3.0|I bought this because of the previews. If I were a died in the wool fan I am sure I would have loved it
B003O86FMW|5.0|love love love this series!!! Never gets boring. Leaves u always wanting more! Can't wait to start 3rd book in series
B008G33OJM|5.0|This is a PAL format Blu-ray, which is the European/British format broadcast standard, as opposed to the NTSC standard in the USA. PAL/NTSC have nothing to do with Region Coding, so even though this disc is Region Free, it will NOT play on US players that do not support the PAL format. I suspect that this disc is also a 50Hz disc, as many European/British PAL Blu-rays are, as opposed to the 60Hz discs sold and playable in the USA. SO UNLESS YOUR BLU-RAY PLAYER SUPPORTS PAL/50HZ DISCS, AND ALSO CONVERTS 50HZ TO 60HZ FOR AMERICAN TVs, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO VIEW THIS BLU-RAY IN THE USA. (Unless you have a TV that supports both 50Hz and 60Hz, AND a player that plays PAL/50Hz - in that case you'd also be able to view this disc in the US.) SONY PLAY STATIONS DO NOT SUPPORT PAL BLU-RAYS. Below is a list of US Blu-ray players with PAL/50Hz capabilities.

B0092MKFIY|4.0|I work in a bookstore and in the cd rotation I started noticing one song and then another from this album that I really enjoyed.  So finally I decided there were enough songs that I was hearing and liking that I might just want to buy the album.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This flash makes all the difference.  Very easy to use, and the difference in your pictures is amazeballs.  The colors are great, and I haven't had a single case of red eye using it.
B007MU85D0|4.0|There were a couple songs on the radio that I kept catching in the morning when getting ready for work that I really enjoyed off this album and so I thought maybe I should listen to the samples of all the songs to see if the rest of the album sounded as good.  I liked what I heard so decided to pick up the album and haven't been disappointed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|its the best show ever. great drama and surprises.  I have been a fan since the beginning.  I hope it has a long run.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I have both of her albums and this one is my favorite so far.  There's just something about her voice that I really love and it's not like everyone else you hear on the radio.
B0018J2QB8|4.0|Dexter is a witches brew--crisp analytical dialog, tight story lines, maniac killer main character, but likeable?? ultimately gross, but entertaining.=
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son can't get enough of it. It is a great game for everyone in the family, easy to get the hang of and addicting to say the least.
B0089LX8II|4.0|Ben Logan (Aaron Eckhart) works for a security testing company in Belgium.  His teen daughter, Amy (Liana Liberato)attends high school. One day when Ben goes to work he finds out his company is missing and never existed.<br /><br />Being a former CIA agent, Ben investigates. He ends up on the lam battling the CIA, authorities, and a corporation that all want him and his daughter dead. Amy quickly goes from a snarky teen to Internet sleuth.<br /><br />The film consists of a lot of double agents. The twists are shown to the audience which takes away from any mystery aspect. It is the \\"Bourne\\" type of film with one man against the system. This one has the addition of a daughter.<br /><br />This is a fairly decent film for those who like the \\"Bourne\\" type of film, especially if your thirst was not satisfied with that latest 4th \\"Bourne\\" installment.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Again, another family favorite. My three year old LOVES it and is actually getting into Star Wars more due to this game! It is fun to share the Star Wars experience with my kids.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Its a good game but some times it freezes and makes my kindle glich the cool thing about it is that its really just a fun spiderman game
0316228532|2.0|I had heard all the reports about this book before it came out. Saying it was entirely different than her other books was an understatement!!  I bought it though thinking since I liked her other books so much I would like this one. Boy, was I wrong.  It is so hard to follow.  Jumps all over the place.  And characters, oh my goodness you need a pad and pencil at your side to keep track. And some of the expressions she uses are definitely from where she lives.  I will finish it though as I am one once I start a book I do.  I am hoping that it will get better but being as I am half way through it I doubt it.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I was happy to finally find an app that prints directly from my Kindle Fire. BUT after 5 pages it stopped, saying &#34;error, printed all allowed pages&#34; and that I must buy Printbot Pro. Both the Google and Amazon store buttons it furnished dumped me back at Amazon KINDLE store that does not have Pro. What mean jerks they are to dangle a carrot out to me and then snatch it away! This would be 5 stars if they carried through.
B007N8RULO|4.0|i enjoy this game because it is easy to relax and play and unlike some others i,'ve played, i can do this game watch tv at the same time and enjoy both
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Wanted to complete my set of theses movies and this was a great deal and got fast shipping. Comes with standard and extended copies.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book, Fifty Shades of Gray, I just had to have the 2nd book and then I had to have the 3rd book. I am so upset there isn't a 4th book. I am so ready to reread all 3 books and any other books by this author. Simply couldn't put it down. Even read during my lunch hour instead of eating. Highly recommend it. Can't wait for the movie.
1451627297|5.0|This book is a must read.  With a hint of science fiction tied in with a level of historical research that rivals the best, the story takes you for a wild ride to the past.  The author literally transports you back in time to a different era and creates a cast of characters that the reader can easily relate to.  Highly recommended read!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this show is the boom .<br />his is the best show on tv.<br />i'm addicted .<br />( good quality just like dvd )
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I realized how buggy and cheap it is. I really was enjoying the game thought it was cute but then I run into all the bugs and on top of it the cost in gems to buy IMPORTANT things in a free game. I really had an issue with the social aspect too because not everyone on facebook is a briny or pegasister. :(
B000Q99EAC|5.0|I liked the story line. Like every boxer no matter what age you want to go out and proof that you still have something in you.
B0072OFM28|4.0|I love the production values of this series, and enjoy seeing so many hot men in such brief attire, (sometimes nude), but the violence, complete with flying blood in slow motion, is far more than necessary to get the point across.
B005T87QCI|1.0|so i get the game and i think you have ALL the characters but no you have to unlock them all, even my fav robot, Noisey Boy how u unlock plz respond
B000S5ASM2|5.0|The &#34;New World Symphony&#34; is a work I've loved since my teens but only recently realized was missing from the classical library on my iPod.  This recording fills that gap very nicely.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|Excellent condition, good timing. Music was typically beautiful for a Lloyd Webber production, nice follow-up for Phantom of the Opera.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of AMC's greatest shows.Walking Dead series is one I would recomend to anyone who like's a well produced and directed series.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved book 3! Awesome love story! I enjoyed the ending of the book...the insight to their future and very much enjoyed Christian's point of view. Look forward to reading more from EL James
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Beautifully written story of a young girl who cannot love or be loved.  Her journey is heartbreaking until she discovers her love for flowers which ultimately opens the door for her to trust and (maybe) love the few people in her life that have that have reached out to her.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Even the briefest of quick start tutorials would be helpful. I can't even get in the front door, much less solve anything. I downloaded it as FAOTD, so I have no qualms about deleting it.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Tim Burton Delivers again. Definitely well made and thought out. May be that's exactly how it played out ;-) Worth seeing.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am a big Mahjong fan and rate this one as very good. I liked the different levels and that it is timed.
8866131350|5.0|Excellent. Very satisfied with this purchase. This is a very well organized planner. Binding is solid, nothing's falling apart. Good quality paper, too. There's even a neat little mini-folder in the back of the planner to store small pieces of loose paper. I'll definitely be purchasing another one of these next year!
0446547573|2.0|I usually enjoy mr. Sparks writings but this was predictable.  It took effort to even complete. To me, the story line was not what I expect from Mr Sparks.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Rod Stewart is a genuine classic. He has such a unique voice and he brings his own touch to Christmas songs we've grown to love through the years. He can even make these songs sound sexy!
1439152802|5.0|It is easy to put expectation on the writings of a favorite author.  This time it was worthy of the wait.  Forgotten garden is still my favorite but this story comes close.  Ms. Morton's ability to jump back and forth in time is exceptional and her characters are, as usual, well developed.
1881273873|4.0|I found this book very informative and I used some of the information on a friend and it worked! I would recommend this book to friends, family, and loved ones. This book taught me about the different languages of love and how and when to apply it in life.
0316228532|1.0|Sadly, 4 letter words and coarse vocabulary are not to my liking.  The imagination and creative author of Harry Potter series has gone to a place I prefer not to visit.  If I were able to mail this tome back to her, I would.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I never get tired of listening to her, and although it's certainly not mt favorite Barbra Streisand album I do love it and have to keep my collection complete!
B0080CL0HM|3.0|He's still pale, still sinister-looking. In this film he's seducing women for their money/influence. He's a predator, stalking his victims, one after the other, to obtain what he needs/wants.<br /><br />He's even more of a vampire in this movie than he was in Twilight.<br /><br />Maybe Pattinson should try something upbeat and lighthearted for his next project, give himself a stretch.<br /><br />Just my two bits.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read decent amount of NAVY SEAL stuff but this is one of the most impressive and intriguing no doubt. It's no wonder if you consider the significance of the event even for a foreign citizen myself. Not just the event but their high standard like \\"just passing is failing\\" or \\"2nd place is the first to lose\\" hits my mind hard. You can gain some positive stuff from this book and I definately recommend. Salute for Mark, Walt, Charie, Steve and Tom!
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Should of been so much more! The quality of the film  sucked. Not the story but the actual quality is really bad. Alex is a marginal actor. Why was the old guy in the film?  What a mess.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best book of diary of a wimpy kid so far I hope it they still make better ones though it would still be nice
B007HACDLK|4.0|Classic Mitch Rapp - always entertaining. Just when you think the character has run its course Vince brings him back, and better than ever.
034580404X|5.0|it is good book! It is a excellent book that u can't put down. I would tell everyone about this book.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|There's only one thing I dislike about this product... the fact that they haven't made more! I love their version of 'Starships' and 'Somebody That I Used To Know'. They are extremely talented and I'm impressed with everything about them.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read hands down!  Certainly a must read for any age.  The characters are amazing.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I love how talented and beautiful the voices of Pentatonix are. I've loved their music for awhile, but only recently got enough money to consider buying their music. Well worth it, they're incredible. Carol of the Bells has always been my favorite Christmas song, so hearing their version was incredible. And well worth the price.
B009ANP48G|5.0|If you're going to pay extra for any 3D movie, this should be the one!  This has the best 3D + clarity that I have ever seen in a movie.  This movie looks like it was shot in 3D.  Unlike Thor and Captain America which were shot in 2D and then edited to 3D, this movie looks like it was shot in 3D.  There's a difference, when I watched Captain America, the 3D wasn't all that great, and reviews pointed out flaws like the 3D wasn't constant throughout, it was added to select parts in each seen.  This movie kept up with the technology and took it further.  As for the clarity, well a lot of 3D movies will pixelate the background in order to make their 2D seem more 3D after editing.  The movie showed great clarity and 3D at the same time and when I paused it at intermissions the 3D and clarity were very noticeable and amazing to see.  This is a test that many published articles and reviewers are saying you should do to test the true quality of the 3D, and the same can be done for clarity.  As for the audio, well you can image that it would be great for a movie like this, after all the music is a vital aspect of their movies.  Using a 300 watt Polk subwoofer for the low bass and a secondary 100 watt Sony subwoofer for the higher frequency bass (the \\"punchy\\" bass) coupled with 3 - 100 watt bass shakers on the bottom of the couch and wall mounted surround sound, the music and special effects sounded amazing.  For anyone who wants to take it further, the next step after 3D would be bass shakers on the bottom of your seat so you can feel the bass like you would in the movies, this really brought the movie to life! These movies really keep up with the times, new innovative dance moves, now more realistic with the best 3D technology currently on the market (for 2012), new/current music and the best audio and video (clarity) quality above and beyond the standard of current movies.  One of few movies that you want to watch again, right away!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is really good as it shoes you all the information about the batery...I would recommend this to everyone.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I did not lose any weight on this, but liked the concept. That said, it's worth a read for your own knowledge, but all said, it is not a sustainable lifestyle.
1455527475|2.0|The title of this book leads one to think that it will be an expose of Wall Street and its corrupt ways.  While some things are hinted at, for the most part it is just the career biography of a South African student who dreams of studying in the States and ends up at one of the most sought after companies on Wall Street.  When he started there the system seems to have been based upon the \\"playing up\\" to people method.  Later when the Great Recession hit and society became disillusioned with Wall Street the system changed to a statistical based method of measuring people's job effectiveness.  It apparently led to even more cutthroat ways than what was there before. I admit it, I'm a little skeptical that the playing up to people method was any less cutthroat.  What is amazing is how this fellow lived the American Dream and he isn't even American born and raised.  With so many main street people having limited opportunity I found it saddening that this fellow was able to live something most Americans can't even dream of anymore.
0761158464|4.0|my boys love star wars and I thought this would be a great book for them. It is cute and they like watching the characters move but I wish the pictures were a little clearer... they look better on the online picture than they do in person
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game it really fun my whole family loves the game even my baby sister loves it I'm so happy they have it 4 the kindlr
B006L3RZ26|5.0|This album is excellently done, with Xuefei's elegant and tasty arrangements. Bought one for myself and the second one as a gift.<br />I can't wait for Xuefei's next album!
B00A0MJ9ZA|4.0|This has always been one of my favorite Disney animated films.  Loved it in the theatre, on VHS and DVD.  What I had been waiting and hoping for was that the BluRay edition would restore it to its original 3D format.  Alas, that does not seem to be the case.  Of all the 50's 3D films, this one was probably the best.  The flying over London scene was greeted by spontaneous applause for its breathtaking depth.  Indeed, even in 2D it looks wonderful on DVD, which is why I had hoped for the new issue to include the 3D version with the BluRay edition.  That said, I will still order it, dim the lights in my home theatre and enjoy my trip back to Never, Never Land--the second star to the right and straight on 'til morning!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a phenomenal follow-up to The Hunger Games. Now that it's finished, I feel like I'm suffering from a strange compulsion...one pushing me to read Mockingjay as soon as possible in order to find out what happens to people who have - for all practical purposes - become friends: Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch, Cinna, and Prim. I was excited to see the introduction of a great new character: Finnick. More than anything, I'm glad to find the traits I loved most about The Hunger Games were constants within Catching Fire.<br /><br />The evolution from a game impacting a few people to a game impacting an entire universe of people was perfect. The need - soul-deep yearning - for Katniss to save this world of people who are mentally and physically abused by the District (and President Snow) is so real that even I, the reader, am overwhelmed with the task. Somehow, Katniss does what I'm not sure I could ever do.<br /><br />I've said it before, and I'll say again when I review Mockingjay, but Suzanne Collins is an AMAZING, GIFTED, and EXTRAORDINARY writer! If you haven't begun to read this series, I would strongly recommend that you stop what you are doing, proceed to the nearest bookstore (online or down the road), and get all three. Trust me...you will not be able to stop once you start.
1476715904|5.0|recently joined abook club and this is the first book i have read since joining. it was a fast read bacause i couldnt put it down. i laughed and i cried. now ready to read the 2nd book. point of retreat. gear author. look forward to her other works!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This powerful book should come with a warning: May cause depression<br /><br />Somehow, Suzanne Collins described Katniss' unbearably bleak situation from the beginning of [book:Mockingjay 7260188] until the end in such a manner that I began feeling sad myself. No. Not sad. My emotions would best be described as depressed, dejected, disenchanted, and frustrated. Anything but happy, cheerful, idealistic, or satisfied.<br /><br />While the writing was phenomenal (or why else would I feel so many emotions), my mental health is not worth re-reading this book...ever again. I'm sure that the point of this series was to portray war as horrific. We all know - in our hearts even if we've never been in a real battle for our lives - how horrible it would be to see our family and friends tortured, murder, mutilated, burned, mentally raped, etc. I never want to live through any of that. With Mockingjay, I feel like I have.<br /><br />If I had one wish for this series, it would have been for it to end on a high note rather than the anticlimactic 'it is what it is' ending I was met with after enduring the mental trauma I was made to suffer throughout the entire book.<br /><br />T. R. Graves, author
B009LDMJGA|5.0|This is one of those albums that I'll be listening to ten years from now, I'm not as young as the members of the band, but I know this is as good as \\"Down on the Upside\\" and I'm still listening to that fifteen years later. Trust  me this is a classic. I buy vinyl because Chis Cornell and I love this format.SO TURN THIS MOFO UP AND ROCK OUT !!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of those timeless books that will stay with you forever. In some ways, it is reminiscent of The Lottery combined with a modern-day reality show similar to Survivor. It's a talented author who can describe starvation in such a way the reader feels like they have endured famine...who can build life-threatening events with such reality the reader's heart pounds while hormones of anxiety course through their veins...who can make the reader fall into heartwarming love at the same moment the book's characters do...who can make you mourn - with real tears - when great characters die. Suzanne Collins is just such author. Amazing. Inspiring. One of the greatest.<br /><br />Katniss' selflessness and willingness to give her life for others along with her morals/ethics make her the perfect heroine. Katniss' tales describing her friendship with Gale and their likenesses means there is no way to ignore the strength of their bond and makes you wonder if she unknowingly loves him. Peeta's tender show of unrequited love makes the reader's heart squeeze, and they cheer for him as emphatically as they pull for Katniss to be the winner of the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The Hunger Games and the Capital and the Districts. The world which was created within the covers of this book is very real, making this unbelievable story suddenly plausible and horrific.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book for people of all ages. In fact, I'm dying to tackle Catching Fire, which will be one of my next books.<br /><br />T. R. Graves, author
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Definite page Turner. The tales of Piscine and Richard Parker captivate the reader and transports the mind through this wonderful journey of survival and triumph over an untamed wild animal.  But what of Richard Parker?
B008WHTFL8|5.0|Love this band!  Can't help but smile when I listen to this.  Still as funny as they've ever been!  Good stuff.
B009MF56GC|4.0|When it comes to movies, I'm not the most sophisticated watcher. All I want is to be entertained, enlightened,or just to grab my emotions. Well all I can say is after watching Expendables 2 this was a fun excursion into the ridiculous. The action was explosive to say the least,it has a lot of inside humor and there is a ting of sadness to balance things out. Lets not talk about the acting ,thats not what this film is about. It's about 102 minutes of forgetting the outside world and giving you a great run for your money. Try it you'll like it.
1451695195|5.0|My mother recently passed and during the last weeks of her illness I was struggling with her impending death and felt I needed some answers as to the meaning of life and what happens (if anything) after death, as well as the time leading up to it.  I found this book, and the comfort it brought was amazing.  The author is a neurosurgeon so his thinking is based on science, not wishful thinking or imagination.  I was unable to put the book down once I began reading and found some of his experiences chilling and comforting, especially his reference to the biological sister he had never met (I recently found three siblings I did not know I had).  I was so impressed with this book that I bought four and gave them to family and friends I thought would appreciate it.  Their experiences with the unstoppable reading have been the same as mine.<br /><br />Whether you or a loved one is facing death or whether you are just plain interested in the existence of afterlife or God, this is a book that MUST be read.  The comfort it has brought me has been immense and has opened my heart and mind to a spirituality I never thought possible.
B009DB60W4|5.0|This is really good stuff. It's too bad i don't speak french, but it wouldn't sound so amazing if it was in english. This is by far my new favorite album right now, its been playing non stop in my car. Mon amor, mon ami is an amazing song. I love this album, good job Therion!
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Christmas present for my daughter. She will love it. Looks great, speddy service and I am sure she will enjoy this a lot. Thank you.
B008458O3S|5.0|Build tracks to get color coded trains to their matching colored stations.  Sounds easy, right?  It is for a while before ramping up the difficulty to really make you use your brain.  Very fun and challenging puzzle game.
630460288X|5.0|Daughter will love this movie. Action and comedy all in one. One of the great movies. Christmas is when my daughter will get this. Thank you
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Many advertisements show nature, but they are not about reconnecting with nature but with their 'product' and often disregard for nature.  I did see the movie \\"Life of Pi\\" and have gratitude for it suggesting otherwise.  I suppose many will also see it as too hot or too cold.  In many ways, I think we are living the life of Pi.
0345529057|5.0|Love this series.  I was a bit shy about buying this set as I'm not huge fan of the Dungeon and dragon aspect of the genre.  Other than Lord of the Rings nothing has come close to gathering my attention.  However I ended up watching the show on HBO and got hooked.  I figured if the show is this great the book must be better!  And Thank the seven it was!  Think Brave Heart meets Lord of the rings and you'll get a glimpse of the style and swagger of this series.  I love long epic novels like these that keep me busy and entertained.  George RR Martin, well done!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I get a lot of use out of this app. It's great for waiting room distraction.  Could do without the video commercials.
B00973CGXK|4.0|The Killers never disappoint.  I was afraid they would stray, as they've had a hiatus, but this is good, authentic Killers.  I don't like the album as much as some of their older ones, but it's probably due to the fact that I haven't played it a thousand times yet!  There does seem to be a hint of the ambiance of Brandon Flowers' solo album, but I like that too, so I won't complain.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|The movie's good. and this multipack is also really good. You get to choose between an itunes copy or an amazon copy, PLUS an ultraviolet copy. Along with the blu-ray and dvd, this combo pack is amazing.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|This movie was cute and I'm glad we rented it, but the kids show no interest in owning it or seeing it again.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this app is wonderful. everything is spot on but they didn't make Rarity a unicorn. aside from that its dead on, even the voices well done gameloft.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|This is a kind of mystery story that often stretches the imagination. However if you like reading about various European cities and trying to solve a riddle or two this book offers a quick read without much effort involved.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I love this dvd and have watched it several times since receiving it.  Johnny Depp's wry sense of humor, facial expressions and accent are perfect for the role of Barnabas Collins.  Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a great performance as the matriarch of the Collins clan.  Helena Bonham Carter is a trip as the alcoholic psychiatrist!  The rest of the cast are equally adept at playing their roles as well.  The soundtrack is great, including my favorite, Night's In White Satin by the Moody Blues and the appearance by Alice Cooper is wild!  The visual effects are stunning and eerie and add to the enjoyment of the film.  Love this film more each time I watch it and am happy to have it in my collection.
B00003CXCT|5.0|MY father got me this when I was younger as he saw I loved star wars.... These are theatrical release editions of the movie and not the CGI enhanced stuff. I myself didnt know of course But I appreciate them now so much not only for value but for the quality. The box art and all make it stand in my collection of dvds as a center piece. Considering you only get this as a enhanced version anywhere else this is a great item. The Price NOW is a little over the top to me but maybe for others it might not be. Read reviews make a choice. I love it and my son saw the first ORIGINAL ONE and loves it too - YOU decide but Im here to help as I can.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|Angels Flight, another well written story with unexpected twists and turns. I love Detective Harry Bosch and his determination to find the truth and get the guilty.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This was on my son's birthday list.  It was enjoyable for me to beable to get something he wanted.  He really likes Linkin Park.  I know this is not the first cd he has gotten of them.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie reminded me of great family movies like Swiss Family Robinson, Sound of Music, or In Search of the Castaways because of it's visual appeal. The story and character development are almost as good as Toy Story, but what really struck me is that this type of screen play is usually reserved for flesh and blood actors. Our whole family really enjoyed it.
B008J34466|5.0|Even though this was a gift, I myself, have grown to enjoy Pink just from hearing this cd.  I especially love the song \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\" which she sings as a duet with Nathan from FUN.  My son shared the song with me and then headed to work.  I said, \\"Sure, make me cry and then head out.\\"  I couldn't get enough of the song after hearing it.  My other kids think it is geneous of these two to colaborate on a song because their voices go so well together. Amazon made this purchase possible!
0316187216|5.0|I too have read all of Joe Abercrombie's books and though I may not give this title the Best honorific, it may be second or third.  The return of one of his most beloved characters was enough for me.  His characteristic humor, pathos, humanity treatment of his characters continues to its full effect.  His two main characters (not counting the return of the beloved one) are compelling without being caricatures of themselves, which cannot be said of other popular writers of this genre.<br /><br />I would buy anything written by Joe Abercrombie regardless of the content.  But Joe, say this is the beginning of another trilogy!  It begs for it.
1400069289|5.0|This book is changing my life !<br />Everyone should read it, it puts a lot of things out on perspective!
0525952926|3.0|It felt like a standardized version on the late 30's and 40's.  There was very little in it that was very original.  Pretty sure that there was a mini-series tv 'event' that was very similar.  Book was almost a cliche.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great game, can spend hours on it. Installed perfectly, no force close. Highly recommend to anyone likes puzzle style games.
B00979CS50|4.0|Neil Young remains musically true to himself in this retrospective, sentimental, foray into his Rock&Roll roots. Easy listening. The signature number Psychedelic Pill (both) is just plain good rock. This one will grow on you.
0812548094|5.0|This book -- and the Sword of Truth series as a whole -- is one of the preeminent works of its genre. Period.  I've read the series a dozen times, starting from Book 1 with each new book published (a year or more between each book kept them as fresh reads, or nearly enough so to enjoy). Heroic, noble, evil, redemption. A mirror into the soul of the world and of human nature. As insightful as Ayn Rand's work, a/ a lot faster. What's not to like? I don't care much for Goodkind's more contemporarily set work, but this series rises to iconic in my view.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Easy to read and still has wonderful depth to the story. Good read overall. I liked the movie but the book is even better giving you more detail and feeling that movies can never quite accomplish.
B0076DELIG|5.0|In my opinion, Connelly is at the top of the proverbial\\" pile\\" when it comes crime/mystery writers.  How Harry keeps  pushing on, I'll never know.  But as long as seeks justice, I will continue to buy Michael's books and love to follow Harry.
B000ICXQHE|1.0|Blank ,nothing .I will not buy a movie this way again!,,! Not happy unsatisfied screwed ,taken ,had and smart enough not to do it again !
B005LF9OCE|5.0|I love this show and every season just gets better.  So many great one-liners and always good for a laugh!! It's so much fun growing with the characters and you don't even really need to watch all the episodes to enjoy the show
B009ZTLPJM|5.0|The most incredible thing about Soundgarden releasing this album, is that it can actually stand on it's own with the rest of the Soundgarden catalog and sound relevant in both time periods. Keep in mind the 15 year or so hiatus and the age of the band members and it becomes almost mind boggling.<br />Name one band that brought back all the original members after more than a decade and put out such a cohesive effort. You can't. Because it doesn't happen.<br />I already have my favorites off this one. Blood on the Valley Floor and Bones of Birds are standouts in my opinion. Both have that dark side and visual-lyrical and musical quality that I've always dug about Soundgarden.<br /><br />Chris Cornell sounds better than he has in a long time. Not too many dudes can sing the way he does at all, let alone after 25 plus years. Amazing.<br />Matt Cameron is in a class by himself and Thayils' guitar work is classic SG.<br /><br />If you were looking for Soundgarden circa 1990, sorry, but this band has matured. It happens. Look at Led Zeppelin 1 compared to In Through The Out Door. That's the kind of time period that has passed since Soundgarden came out if not more, and yet these SOB's STILL rock hard and do it well. I think that's pretty cool and that's why it get 5 stars from me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm very dissapointed with this writing. It reminded me the twilight saga but with no vampires-werewolfs theme:). I've thought if it's a bestseller It'g gonna bea good reading but I was mistaken.  It really looks as it was written by a teenager.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is probably the best app I have. All they need to do is add more stuff from Minecraft pc and xbox editions including being able to switch in between creative and survival. Reason being because I made an epic castle on creative and I would like to go in it on survival. I guarantee if Minecraft makes those adjustments, Minecraft - pocket edition will ne better than ever.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am disappointed with Amazon instant video as they do not provided closed captions which supports on Roku I own at this time. I found out that the closed caption does not provided from Amazon Instant Video on Roku (customer Support Service). I have decided to cancel Amazon prime membership so I continued to watch Netflix which do provided closed caption everything on movies and TV which is much better than Amazon Instant Video.<br /><br />Downton Abbey is very interest to watch as it is about incidents at the castle. I will continue to watch Downton Abbey on Netflix because they do provide closed Captions on it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just can't stop playing  once I start! Its soooooooo addictive. My daughter thinks I have a problem because I play it straight when I get home after work.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I saw this movie on the big screen and looked forward to seeing it again at home in my home theater. It was equally exciting and entertaining.  Recommended!
B008HTQ28K|3.0|I loved John Grisham's the Litigators.  Couldn't wait for his next book.  Although The Racketeer is clever enough, I was disappointed.  I think he's a great writer and fortunately I am just one in millions of readers.  I look forward to his next book.
B008MC175A|5.0|I purchased this set mostly to get the \\"Origins\\" and \\"FIrst Class\\" movies, as I already own the X-Men movies on DVD. I was pleasantly surprised that both of these titles were very well filmed with lots of action and great plots revealing the beginnings of the X-Men.  Now, having the other X movies on Blu Ray makes for another great movie watching experience when I decide to revisit those titles.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|go buy this at a lego store ASAP its was still on sale today! also was only $25 bucks! STEAL

0439023491|5.0|Got this for both my daughter and future daughter-in-law.  Both loved it and I stole it and read it too.  Great series.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Typical fast paced Grisham. Keeps the attention until the last page. I enjoyed the book and it only took a couple of days to finish it.
0439023513|5.0|Bought this for both my daughter and future daughter-in-law.  They loved it.  Great series, but of course, eveyeone knows that now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An awesome, creative story! I could not put the book down and am currently working my way through books 6 and 7.
1451695195|4.0|Wonderful experience for him and logically detailed from a doctors point of view, but similar to other books, which is a good thing!
B005M5OSBK|5.0|While on a recent vacation, stopped in a Starbucks; music was playing. Had to wait for a new pot of coffee to brew and so \\"tuned in\\" to the music and was enchanted.  I asked the worker what was playing; she went into the back, was gone for a while, then came back out front and said, \\"Pink Martini\\".  I thought that surely she had misunderstood and had given me the name of the song.  Still, it was a clue. I remembered \\"Pink Martini\\" and when I got home from vacation, I looked those words up, learned about this band, ordered some CDs and have been listening ever since. Wow, do I feel stupid!  They've been around for a while and I've been around for a while and while I like to fancy myself as \\"keeping up\\" and hip, even,I sure missed this band. Had Starbucks not been playing their music that night, I would have remained ignorant of a band and their music that I have come to love!  They are a delightful \\"discovery\\" and a new favorite. Cured of ignorance, I've been dancing around the place to the music of \\"Pink Martini\\"!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|kindle fire hd 8.9 won`t get past second screen. just closes with no error message. based on other reviews it sounds like it was released without adequate testing
1400067820|5.0|There is a sense among many people that things aren't right today, that modern living isn't what it's touted to be.  Government is failing us. Individuals sense the promises of modernity (most particularly, capitalism and democracy) are falling short. What is really going on and why? Taleb provides a valuable insight, rooted deeply in history, experience, and wisdom. While his pomposity gets in the way at times, and while he occasionally overreaches when venturing into areas where direct, personal experience is lacking, his words nonetheless incite and spur the reader to question and think more deeply. Whether you agree with all his claims is beside the point.<br /><br />He is both a man of philosophy and a man of the earth. There is no sugar-coating here. There is no idealistic yet unrealistic framing. This is a man who knows something about the raw core of living. His b****t meter is particularly sensitive.<br /><br />I wish he had been more expansive about fear and courage, but these are nitpicks. Life is messy. In Taleb's world, the messiness is sacred. It is in our desire to control things that are better left alone, and to tidy up the room, that risks and harm grow.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Game looked really good. But every time I started (selecting it on the menu), it crashed on the 2nd or 3rd screen. Disappointing. When I have time, I'll try it on 1st gen fire.
B004WR125O|5.0|Onkyo UWF-1 Wireless LAN Adapter:<br />This little guy just great and flat out works. I have been using it now non-stop for almost a year. I ‘am very glad I bought this when I got my recover.

B004LWZWGK|4.0|Batman Begins and The Dark Knight are both better than The Dark Knight Rises, but few movie series hold this level of quality all the way through. Look how strong the Matrix started and then fell way off. Star Wars, Star Trek, and so many others did not deliver great movies all through their series. Lord Of The Rings is as close as it gets for a great trio, but even it is flawed. I feel like some are putting the bar extra high after how impressive The Dark Knight did. The Dark Knight Rises is a good film. The biggest disappointment is how predictable the finish was, which is not very Nolan like. For such a Maverick film maker, this final installment just did not have that original spin Nolan films often have.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you love the first two, this is worth getting. If you thought the first two were okay, then this is a rental at best.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|But this one can help me sleep when nothing else can. I can pick my mix of sounds, and there are plenty. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because when I try to use it with a headset, no sound. I did contact developers but they had not heard of this issue...<br /><br />UPDATE: I installed this on my Fire HD 8.9 and it works perfectly headphones or not. I have changed my rating to five stars. They also added some more sounds. I love that I can mix up to 8, I think, since most only allow 3,4 or none. The six binaural work really well, I am sleeping or relaxing with them, love this!
B0053O89Z6|4.0|Still amusing, but some episodes getting a bit contrived and campy. I'm not a fan of slapstick and this series is relying less on the sharp writing of earlier years and leaning more towards slapstick. Hope it all ties together sooner than later.
1439127700|5.0|The book strongly implies that Harry Truman was eligible to run for re-election in 1952 only because he had served part of FDR's 4th term.  That is not correct. The fact that Truman served part of that term is irrelevant. Amendment XXII to the Constitution (which created the two term limit for Presidents) specifically excluded Truman as the sitting President when it was adopted. The point is Truman could have run for re-election as many times as he wanted to. I love the book, but hope this gets fixed in the paperback edition.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. Once you get into the jumbo pack it gets little hard. This game really gets your brain working.<br />Have fun.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|liked it had a lot of challenges some where easy and some where hard its a fun game for people who like hidden objects and pezzles
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|when I got this game I thought it was supposed to be just pictures but you are in a 3D world and these are the creators of slender so I rate it 5 and its so SCARY
B0085157B8|3.0|Plenty of action and good affects.  Nice actresses.  Very good plot and easy to follow.  Good beginning and<br />had a good ending.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|For a kid's movie, Paranorman had me laughing and interested in the movie from start to end. My 10 year old neice and my 20-something year old self enjoyed watching this movie, since we're both into science fiction and \\"scary\\" movies, so this was right up our alley. It's a little morbid at times, but if you watch the trailer, you understand it's to be expected. A great lesson learned at the end, as well. I gave it four stars, because it got a little odd for the ending.
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|Great hit package,,, excellent quality sound and mixing... very good price.... glad I bought it here and saved half compared to the tv shopping site!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome awesome if you like hard games get this app app plus you get free coins everyday everyday so so so so so so awesome
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!  I wish there were more levels and more games just like this for me to play.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its just as it should be. Easy to play. Quiet mindless actually, which is what I wanted. A++ If you want good ole' fashion solitaire....this is it!!
0345525558|5.0|My wife is in a book club.  Every month I order her a book and I would say she only finishes 2 out of 10.  This book is one that she finished and she is really enjoying it so it must be good.
B007SGM084|5.0|Everyone was so wrapped up I the sex (which was fun to read, but not what the whole story was about). I loved the whole story. Was it an adult version of Twilight...not to me. Was it amazing to be wrapped up in a story...yes!!! Don't let &#34;all the sex&#34; scare you....read and decide for yourself.....you will find you love it.
B0082KPF32|5.0|Just get it, it's impossible to describe in words. I am listening to this for the 6th day in a row non stop, and every time I find something new
B0073LWEXK|5.0|It now works on the Kindle Fire and WOW it is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played!  I did have to use some of the hints though :3 but still... AMAZING!!!
B00650SSDU|1.0|Not funny. Great actors bad movie role. Got this movie because family in town visiting wanted to see it. Bad mistake especially since I bought it. I wish it had a been available for rental instead.<br />It wasn't even cheesy. It just really sucked!!!
0131103628|5.0|Hello all:<br /><br />This book IS the C reference. Time and again I use to flip its pages, looking for basic concepts of C. Every C programmer msut have a copy of it in his library.

1469984202|5.0|I can't begin to express properly how much I enjoyed the Omnibus collection of the Wool series. Juliette is my new favorite literary heroine, and I am officially a Wool-ite. Is that a term? Has it been invented yet? It should. What an impressive saga; so well written, original, and poignant. A tale of treachery, survival, bravery, desperation -- the human condition at its best, *and* at its worst that pulled me completely in didn't let go. I think differently about climbing stairs now. Differently about a lot of things. Hugh Howey has created something wonderful and I cannot wait to see what he has next in store for his readers.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|Fantastic Edition for a fantastic Movie! A mith of cinema in a definitive edition in BluRay. Only for Cinemaniacs! ;)
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I got this bag with my Nikon D5100, and have been pleasantly surprised at it. I didn't have a lot of experience with DSLRs or carrying them around, so I wasn't quite sure what I was going to want or need out of a bag. I figured this was a pretty good place to start with the price point where it is. The bag is sturdy and has some basic padding around the edges to protect your camera and lenses. There is plenty of adjustable dividers within the main pocket to make sure you can hold a variety of sizes of cameras, lenses, hoods, filters, etc. I carry all my equipment in it: camera, 2 extra lenses, filters, straps, cards, lens hood, charger, etc. It holds quite a bit and is actually pretty comfortable to carry around. They didn't rewrite the book on a backpack, but it is a basic backpack that carries my camera nicely. I recommend it for a nice, basic bag.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I think this game stinks because the way you move is horrible I think you should play the demo first
B009OXS8RQ|5.0|great album especially on vinyl and a great price too. didnt know if this album would be that good but it gets better and better each time you listen to it.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|After a long wait I finally received my copy of Sunken Condos by Donald Fagen. I didn't mind the wait though because for me - I live in The Netherlands - the disc was cheaper to get in USA. Go figure. ;-) Exellent cd -immaculate production- as usual from Donald. Correct packaging by Amazon. I'm happy.
031250926X|5.0|One of the best books that I have ever purchased. My son did not put it down for a solid week. He loves that he can slide the pictures back and forth by himself. The illustration is wonderful. Great quality book and price was great. Would highly recommend to any toddler or infant.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Grrreat lead music and sound effects! Makes you stop and think! Love it!!! Doesnt compare to Angry Birds as completely different and more thought provoking yet kooky fun if to try to max everything out!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is compared to Forest Gump but not a copy cat. It's wonderfully original with terrific characters and twists. It's an intelligent book and takes place mostly in Sweden but really all over the world. I didn't always get the historical references but history buffs would love it. I hope they make it a movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It kept me interested at every page and I couldn't wait to read the next book. Loved the characters. Very good story.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|I recieved mine 11/16/12 it's a gift so I got nervous with all the writing about some albums having sound issues. Abby Road definitely has some popping sounds in Come Together and Octopuses Garden has a loud thump at the end of the song. Yellow Submarime has a few pops as well. I didn't listen to much else I decided to call Amazon and they are rushing me out  a new set. I have my fingers crossed.........
B006LSZECO|1.0|I have never been as disappointed as I was while reading this book. Not even sure how this is a best seller.<br /><br />Mary Higgins Clark could write a better suspense novel in her sleep. I dont even want to waste any more time writing about how average this book was.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The human part of this story comes through well. A lot of the factual stuff is obviously and intentionally left out, but there is enough facts to make the story a great read.
B0095R64AO|2.0|The name of the film is appropriate because I felt all of the 5 long years watching it - it was way too long. Some good elements, but too much unneeded (and unwanted) footage was included in the final cut. I actually skipped ahead about 20 minutes during the middle of the film and didn't feel like I missed anything.
B008D1RCI6|5.0|Hi! I've listened to this album for weeks now and I have to tell you it is so beautiful - maybe one of the best CDs I've have listened to for years .. So much music produced today lacks of real feelings, soul and authenticity and this just got it. I read some people are disapointed, but I guess because they are not used to this kind of music - it is timeless. Bill Fay is not god, but, I can tell you he has got it in his voice and music! Thank you Bill Fay for all beautiful moments!
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|this is probably the best angry birds app ever, except for maybe the original, but like others have mentioned the Google play store has already released the hoth update. please do the same!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Wow talk about poor vetting, why make this app the FAOTD when it crashes on Amazon's flagship device.<br /><br />I have tried to run this app 10 times, power cycled my kindle and tried again. No luck.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I downloaded Fishdom on the advice of my adult daughter. She said it was fun and I agree with her! You won't be disappointed!
B001EBWITA|5.0|this movie had two things i love. Reeves as the main actor and the angel and demond theories with a twist. a must see for any fan of the genre
B005KA188S|5.0|This is a modern upbeat comical vampire movie that has a great cast, and enough gore to be a favorite
B001O1O71C|5.0|Very sad as seen through the eyes of a child. Gives you a new understanding of the situation and the innocence of children.
B004S5FVJS|5.0|I have done no housework. I read all day and night (exagerating). I am now addicted to David Baldacci's books, &#34;Camel Club&#34; in particular. A good writer leaves you hanging from one chapter to the next David Baldacci leaves you hanging from one book to the next. I love it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Super great book just like the other two before this one.  It's so hard to put down a book this good!!
B004S49YVU|5.0|A fantastic read. Full of suspense from the very first paragraph. Eye opening when it comes to the &#34;Secret Service&#34; and governments and the way they treat people. Left me hanging in the air with an urge to read the next &#34;Camel Club&#34; book.
B00992CF6W|2.0|just bought this for kindle fire hd. and there is no way to use the crafting table. so i cant make pick axes... kind of annoying. and its only in create mode. no plain survival mode. kinda beat. the xbox version is way better.
0060574216|4.0|This book is a good read and can really help you see the other side of a situation.  The best it has to offer is when it gets you to think about how you can unknowingly influence situations by how you react to them, or how you word what you say.  Simple little changes can make a difference and you don't need to change anything about your personality or someone else to do it. All in all, this book should be taken as a tool of different things to think about and not as a catch all for problem solving.  Everyone is different, it does acknowledge that.  The chapters on love letters was way overdone however, and if you start to drool, I strongly suggest skip it and move on.  Getting a martian to write a love letter is a whole nuttha' book! (and probably an activity better left to school children in the long run)
1934030597|5.0|The book is that what I was looking for, the newest edition is the most complete I ever seen before...
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I Hate it!!! :/ :/ I mean like why did I even download it like, what's my chiz....? I am gonig to delete this app...game or what ever;/  forget you app.:( yaaa
B008UTV6S8|5.0|I am new to the watching concerts on DVD experience. This was wonderfully intimate. The camera angles and focus on the performers added to this experience of being on state with the band. The music was fantastic for Paul Simon devotees.
B001A3GSFW|4.0|Not a huge punk fan, but the Ramones influence in music can not be denied.  There are some really great tracks on this collection, and even some that in my opinion are not so super.  If you care at all about understanding what has influenced more modern rock music, definitely check out the Ramones!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a very entertains and well written book. I recommend this for anyone. Good story that evolves and opens up many aspects of this man's life.
B003EY7IUY|3.0|Not my favorite in the Shopaholic series.  Characters seem a bit aloof to the reader.  Still not a bad read.  If you enjoyed the previous Shopaholic books, you will no doubt like this one as well.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|mindless fun and no brain power needed. great way to relax. would really like more coins faster. hats having to wait for them to regenerate. looking forward to reaching level 100
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book. The way the author switched back and forth between the past and present kept my interest the entire book. This could have been potentially confusing but it wasn't at all. I loved the characters and felt they were all really well-developed. The unconditional love surrounding Victoria was refreshing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this WAY better than temple run!!! I love this game. in temple run, I didn't know why the monkeys were chasing you, but in this game, it is very clear. the characters and the graphics are cool too. I LOVE THIS GAME, THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME NOW! DOWNLOAD NOW!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What to read now that the Fifty Shades series is over...I loved it!  Maybe I'll have to start over at the beginning!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I have always loved this story and even though some people may not like this new version I appreciate how it was done.
B000W9399S|1.0|I'd heard good reviews for Discworld but didn't realize until too late that the first Discworld book is widely known for not being as enjoyable as later installments.  Unfortunately, this book was so obtuse, so difficult to understand, and so uninteresting that I feel no motivation to read other Discworld books to find out if I would like them better.  I felt so stupid while reading this book because I just could not understand what was happening, and I didn't care enough to make it worth all the effort.
B002SYXCVK|5.0|This is along the lines of the recording that Sting did of John Dowland songs several years ago.  Loved that and I'm really enjoying this.  Not exactly traditional Christmas favorites, but intriguing music and done with impeccable musicality.
B001BHTN9A|5.0|At some point, we're going to have to come to terms the fact that the party that squeals the loudest about terrorism IS in fact our contribution to world terrorism.  There's an awful lot of wigglin' and dancin' trying to cover it up.  But the nation is just on the verge of waking up.  When it's awake, what to do about it will be the next big fight.
B005KJZDXK|2.0|I picked this up on the recommendations of a friend. As a fan of Zoey Deschannel (at least what I had heard of her from various movie soundtracks) I had great hopes. Sorry to say that I was very disappointed in the music. There wasn't one song on the album that I could say was better than ok, and many of them require me to stretch my positive thoughts for them just to get that far. It seemed like it would be a great album for someone who loves the classic performers of Christmas music (Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, etc.) but I would have to say that I would still much prefer hear them than this. The only consolation that I have is that they didn't do any of my favorite Christmas songs, and so didn't have to go through hearing them.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|To me that about says it all.  It's surrealist, and makes no apologies for it.  Anybody who thinks they can actually pull this off in real life is missing the point.  It's a morality play, and Gilligan's going to take it to it's Faustian Conclusion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and the ability it gives me to have multiple translations at my fingertips no matter where I go. I do have trouble navgating sometimes when i want to change versions, but that is probably my problem and not the apps. Love the notes, bookmark, and highlight capabilities.
B000ILYYJE|5.0|It's hard to figure out what you're paying for by the descriptions, but if you're primarily interested in the music and not the spiffed up Rhino doorviewer &#34;viewmaster&#34; thing, get the other &#34;newer&#34; one.  The engineering is fine.  I was worried that the horns would be given short shrift in the remixes, but I think they turned out fine.  I'm sort of in the Keyboard player's (Manzarek) camp/mindset of the Jazz being the real glue of the group.  YMMV.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|You've done it again.  A must have for any or wanna be author, or if you just want something new to read to cool the brain cells.
B008KE3960|5.0|A free and amazing game. A fun twist on the tower defense games. Played it for so long my tablet nearly burned me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|If you enjoyed reading The Firm by John Grisham you more than likely will enjoy reading The Racketeer.  The Racketeer has the same fast paced thrill ride as The Firm.  I didn't want to put the book down.  Nor did I want the story to end........<br /><br />I hope John Grisham delights us with a follow up story on this new main character and some of his cohorts.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|This movie had me cracking me up! Oh my gosh it's one of those dirty, quirky teen movies that I think all ages could enjoy, except kids of course, but it's hilarious. The only disturbing part if the naked men on the beach- when I say naked, I mean NAKED and they run naked letting it all hang out. Lol but it was a very funny movie. I dare you to watch it.
B00002DE4L|4.0|if you have ever seen the movie of the same name then you must have this CD, not that its rocks greatest must have but rather to satisfy ones curiosity.... the songs sound good in the movie but apart from &#34;Eternal Flame&#34; none get a real lot of play, hence the sound track I suppose...nice concept movie soundtrack....wonder if it will ever catch on?<br />Like i said its not the best in rock history but its good enough and enjoyable enough to justify owning it... have fun with it...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely love his series. Such a wonderful author new and upcoming I would recommend Anyone to read his series you will be begging for more.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I am very deisappointede in this book.  I cannot think of one good thing to say about  it.  It's boring and more of an ego trip than it should be.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Setup was easy enough.  Works fine with dual monitor setup.  That surprised me.<br />I have only used it with same wifi network, not at two locations yet.<br />Basically you can use the \\"home\\" computer as cloud computing/storage.<br />Does not work once you lock the home computer. I wish that worked.
B001AITGWE|5.0|Our days' drama beautifully translated into a movie. Moving! Anyone, anywhere and any time could be Bill. He just tries to do the right thing and falls victim through the cracks of a shallow society. Someone loves and understands you, Bill!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|thought this looked fun .  but when i tried to open it on my kindle hd it crashed.  so had to remove it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is an enjoyably addictive game.  The whole family loves standing around watching, giving pointers and yelling &#34;My Turn! My Turn!&#34;
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I work with teenagers.  I like them.  I sympathize with the difficulty of being an introspective, bright teen.  They see too much and do too little.  Then there's this little book.  I saw the movie first and saw the perfection of Sam as a target for a crush; a coup for a young actress.  I thought the movie was excellent, not trite but right on.  My seniors told me to see the movie and talked about it for ten minutes.  So what about the book?  Not since Cuckoo's Nest have I encountered a movie and a book that are both outstanding and are both significantly different.  Charlie seems like a young photographer from Rent.  An observer.  But his incredibly caring friends draw him into one significant experience after another.  Is this realistic?  My students think so.  Is this moving?  They think so.  I paid my teen dues forty years ago but can still resonate to the issues in this book.  Book first, movie second?  I can't say.  Just do them both.  My strongest emotion about this book is that I wish I had had friends like this.  I wish I had had Charlie's courage to earn such friends.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  The characters were a  sad bunch...no redeeming features...but I enjoyed the way the story played out.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|The set is perfect. Cel frame from film, glorious book and of course one of the best films ever made with an iconic performance.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I thought it was a great app but it erased my sisters one day and the next time she went on it was Christmas version but mine stayed normel. I had to dicard it then download it again.  :( other wise it is an awesome app
B005LAIHY0|4.0|the set is awesome. completes my alien film collection. the interactive smartphone thing caused my Bluray playback to break up, so i might be careful using that. eventually had to unplug player and restart it because it froze up my Bluray played.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|I loved the movie and gweneth Paltro. She can sing beautifully and is multi talented. All the music n characters were great. I watch the movie over n over just love it n having to cd to pop in while riding in the truck turn it up loud and roll its great
B005IQZB14|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Cheryl Strayed's adventures on the PC trail. She is one very brave lady. As far as I am concerned this book is a Must Read!
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Great story, great fighting w/out loads of gore. If you're a fan of Rocky, you'll love this. The story wasn't too predictable and well written/acted.
B006LSZECO|5.0|All I can say that this is definitley a book that will keep you on the edge of what ever you are sitting or lying down on! Be prepared for surprises!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun fun fun. this game would be better if it didn't rely so much on getting things from your friends or spending actual money. Similar to facebooks Frontierville.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed Fall of Giants and Winter of the World was a can't put it down read. Can't wait for the final book in this Century Trilogy!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have read her two other novels, so I downloaded this one, as well. She creates such flawed characters. Her novels are an easy read. I love them.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This was the first Jack Reacher book that I have read. I did enjoy it and will probably read another one although I did find it a bit over the top!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Great season finale. Great image quality and sound. Every season tops the previous one and this is for sure no exception.
B003Q6D1Z6|1.0|I can't believe the amount of favorable reviews on here for this movie.  There is nothing shocking or interesting being said in this movie.  The marketing for this was telling you to watch this before all your friends so that no one could spoil the ending.  There is nothing shocking about this \\"twist\\" ending.  If you're over twelve and know that sometimes people lie about themselves when they're online, you'll see the ending coming a mile away.  The movie was setup as a documentary but the actors were not the least bit believable.  I'd expect anyone in the age range of the actors/filmmakers to be smart enough to know that something was up.  Honestly people, don't waste your time on this movie when there are so many better ones out there.
B0080K3G4O|5.0|I picked up Antidote after hearing an interview with the author on Slate.com. The book is well-written, concise, interesting, and doesn't labor any point too much. The author clearly spent a lot of time researching the book, and some of his experiences were memorable, being presented in a witty, self-deprecating way.<br /><br />The discussion presented in the book is more philosophical than of the self-help variety. Self-help books are traditionally positive thinking books while philosophy books are not, so it is a natural choice. That is not to say that the book is dense or inaccessible. It is highly accessible to any reader with copious examples to illustrate its points.<br /><br />I came to this book with previous experience with Buddhism, some knowledge of Stoicism, and a tendency to feel nauseous when encountering the positive thinking mantra. Before reading this book, I assumed that this made me a bad, \\"negative\\" person, but after reading it I realized that, if anything, my so-called negativity was more beneficial to me than the positivity that many people are desperate to cultivate in themselves. As the book explains, being \\"negative\\" doesn't mean harping on the downside of everything, but it does mean taking a path away from strict positivity. It explains that most people ignore the negative sides of life, trying to wish them away in rosy colored aphorisms and mantras. Those negative aspects, however, are part of life and being unable to confront them and help people accept them is a big part of why the positive thinking manuals fail.<br /><br />Some of the best parts of the book:<br /><br />- I found the idea that \\"you don't have to feel like doing something to do it\\" a relief. Of course, I knew this when it came to doing the dishes, but I'd never applied it to my workaday life, having had it drilled into me that you have to love your job every moment and jump out of bed with excitement to do it. Although sometimes your job is so bad you should quit. Everyone feels like not getting down to work sometimes, no matter what they do.<br /><br />- The idea of living life with an awareness of death was something I'd heard about in the context of Steve Jobs and Buddhist philosophy, but I think that this book presents it in a more personal way that you don't have to be a successful CEO or a monk to practice it.<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend this book at anyone who has failed to find what they're looking for in the self-help section and wants an easy introduction to a whole new perspective on life.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|it skipped a great deal. i checked for dust etc and there wasn't any. the movie was very interesting and i was very disappointed.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I find this game to be fun.  just wish you could get coins faster. my son and niece love playing coin dozed.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Not quite as good as the previous seasons but I still enjoy watching can't wait to see what's to come.
B0085YAGMA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I like British humour!  There isn't a boring moment with all the characters and uncomfortable situations.
1452101248|5.0|The recipes are awesome....so creative and the book is the best quality ever! Beautiful to flip through and my friends each had to borrow it!
0316227706|5.0|Seth Casteel's skill at capturing the determination and competitive spirit of these precious pets is truly amazing!  You cannot look at the pictures without smiling or laughing out loud!.  It is truly a treasure that I will cherish forever!  Thanks to Seth and his obvious love for &#34;man's best friend&#34;.
B001JU4S44|5.0|A fast paced, action adventure film.  Excellent plot and a movie one never tires of re-watching.  Always a unique story
B007HACDLK|5.0|Maybe the best, yet. Had to make myself put it down. Wanted to make it last, but couldn't help myself. Can't wait for the next one. But just can't get any better.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|When the Mark of Athena came out, I had just started the Percy Jackson series. I finished them all very quickly, including the Son of Neptune and The Lost Hero. I was so excited to finally read the book, having gone through a perilous journey with Percy. In case you didn't know, The Heroes of Olympus series is about the Prophecy of Seven, who will unite with the gods to defeat Gaea and her evil minions.<br />  In the Prophecy of Seven it includes:<br />Jason- son of Zues (or Jupiter)<br />Percy-son of Poseidon (or Neptune)<br />Piper- daughter of Aphrodite (or Venus)<br />Frank- son of Ares (or Mars)<br />Hazel- daughter of Hades (or Pluto)<br />Leo- son of Hephaustus (or Vulcan)<br />Annabeth- daughter of Athena (or Minerva)<br />In this book, Annabeth is forced to follow the Mark of Athena by her very own mother. Nico di Angelo is kidnapped, and the seven must fight two mysterous giants, while Piper is flooded  with worry because of the scenes shes seen in her blade, Katoptris. And to make the matter worse, Gaea is slowly awakening and eidolons are flying in every which way. Last of all, Annabeth must confront Athenas evil enemy-Arachne. The seven will have to work together, with love bursting in all places, and hope slowly trickling away. This book is phenominal, and this book has been the best in the series. Thank you to all that bothered to read this review, and Rick, keep up the good work. :)
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Interesting, I did like the number 2 Crossfire trilogy, definitely I recommend the books. Can't wait to read the next.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app. I have been wanting a sound machine but they are so expensive. This app is perfect! For those that are complaining about the extra sound....swipe your screen! There are 3 full pages of sounds!
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Based on the sample I downloaded on my Kindle, I was expecting a sweet story<br />of an older man's journey to see his old friend before she died.  It was a much darker,<br />sadder tale of grief and tragedy.  I needed something a little lighter, so that is why I<br />give it only 3 stars.  The writing was very good, however, and the story slow but compelling.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|It may sound a bit demented, but I love disturbing books that are very realistic and this book is right up there at the top. Loved, loved, loved it. Not many books or movies really \\"get me\\", but this story line you could really see happening and the terrifying results of a distorted mind. If one reads this review and knows of other realllly good, scarry, realistic, books/authors.... please share. Hope others will find my review helpful. Linda
B008EKON56|5.0|A fairly simple device yet it serves the purpose. I like to listen to music on my iPhone for hours and I recently upgraded my ear buds to almost $400 Westone UM3X In Ear Monitors. I use this device to give me line out to my FiiO 6 HP amp and I can charge at the same time.
B005SZAEYO|4.0|AHS was a great attempt at a horror tv show.  I think what really made it a good series was the acting.  The Harmon's, Tate, Neighbor(Jessica Lange...Can't believe I forgot her name on the show...starts with a C I think), and the orignal owner's wife gave amazing performances. The standouts being Tate, Lange, and the owners wife.  The show started off fast paced and I couldn't stop from watching back to back to back episodes they were so good, but then they did start to get a little dull.  I was happy with the last few episodes though, which in turn made this 3 star review into a 4 star review.  I think they could have done better with some of the other characters on the show.  They seemed to be too similar to other characters I've seen in movies/tv shows.  Honestly you could have removed those characters and it wouldn't have affected the main story (I don't want to name any characters due to this being spoiler free). I just found them to be corny. To sum things up though, it's a great series, it's free with amazon prime, and something you may watch more than once.  Season 2 so far has been sub par compared to Season 1 so enjoy it while you can!
B0049U4INC|3.0|It is a conceptual book, recommended for those who works public relation activities. . . . . . . .
B0091REZMW|4.0|pretty good game until I had to start over because the game froze..Also not happy when I was going to purchase diamonds the great deal showing in the app is not the same when u hit purchase it far less than what was showing
B0043RSK3K|4.0|This work shed new light on the foreign policy history of the United States.  Its major drawback is itthebenign treatment of  Stalin, while a major strength is to debunk the myth of Truman as a &#34;near great&#34; president.  The authors point out a number of missed opportunities on the part of the United States.  I also appreciated the fact that it corrected the record of Henry Wallace who, like Al Gore would have changed history for  the better had they been elected President of the United States.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I've been playing the game for a while. It's neet, but slow. Most things take at least your waking hours if not all day. Patience or deep pockets to buy in game gold highly recomended. Otherwise perfect as an OCD game.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|...but when download finishbed, all songs on recording didnt' download. so i cant really reviuew what i havent heard. but I like the artist
B00003CXBK|5.0|It is One of the best movies I have ever seen. it also arrived in great condition. Hayao Miyazaki is a great director
B001S86J2Q|4.0|Product in mint condition.  The DVD came with the case open though but other than that it was fine. Tnx.
B00A3AY134|3.0|There are so many songs missing from this CD. I guess you can't include every song. However, I dont think they have been aoround long enough to have a greatest hits CD.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK....but I have to read it in segments because it is so over whelming....Hightly recommend this read!
B009T3AHDE|1.0|I like David Cronenberg. Generally. I'm open to innovative ways of conveying everyday problems. But my god, this was just terrible. First, let me say that Paul Giamatti and Robert Pattinson were probably the only ones here who didn't embarrass themselves. I was ashamed for Juliette Binoche, who does nothing more than slut it up (for no reason?) in a limo. Samantha Morton, as you might be able to tell from the trailers, only speaks if she can say \\"future\\" at least 300 times in a single sentence. And then there's Sarah Gadon, 2012's Worst Supporting Actress, as far as I'm concerned. As weird as the film is, it's like she's part of another movie altogether. I can't imagine Cronenberg even bothered to direct her. She has zero chemistry with everybody and everything. Sometimes, it's like she has no idea where the camera is. The dialogue is clunky and awkward. The story makes no sense, especially near the end, when the guns come out and people decide they're bored being rich. Do yourself a favor and give this one a pass.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|well my son cannot get enough of this movie and the picture quality is just gorgeous. Very happy with this purchase.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great Storyline. A little action and a great romance as always. Definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan of romance.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This CD is great! Especially if you like indie/folk music! Music is similar if you happen to enjoy Mumford and sons or The lumineers
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Awesome movie and at a great price of only .99.  Thank you for the opportunity to rent the movie. now i am caught up on the series.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Had to get this for my college movie collection. A classic, wonderful, funny-as-hell movie. Will be watching it many times in my four years at school.
B0045XICB2|5.0|Awesome movie and it was great to be able to rent the movie for only .99 thank you for the opportunity
B004NYCRL4|5.0|Had to read this book for an English class. After already having read it in high school, I was glad to read it again and purchase my own copy. A good story for sure.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love this show so much that the fact that it seems to be dragging the plot toward a big event, likely the siege at the prison, is excusable. I've been a lifetime zombie fan and its great to finally see a series that can pull off the genre with a realistic flare and I minimum of course language. TV can be exciting without screaming fowl stuff in my ear. Way to go, WD. Keep it up.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My child snags my Kindle every chance he gets to play this game.  The object is to get thru an obstacle course and gain points without running into electric fire-y rod.  As you gain points, you can 'buy' new packs to get you through the course faster.  Mr. Cuddles (the Dragon) is the most fun one.
B00080Z53O|5.0|For a film that has a lot of dialog, I was spell bound watching it. The acting is superb, the story develops beautifully, and the cinematography is wonderful. Great entertaining film, but in a deep and moving way. I did not agree with the characters perception of life and the value of ending it, however the story was true to the characters perspective and their struggle with the issue of euthanasia, all in a sensitive and yet believable manner. The film is in Spanish and the subtext English, that was effective since it made the characters real. Great movie, never heard of it until I accidentally found it.
B000SP3DE2|5.0|Re-watching this movie after many years didn't dull its shine for me in the least.  Gary Oldman is a treasure in this movie.  The acting is a tad overdone but for this era it's puur-fect!  Great for an evening at home when you want a mix of romance and action.
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|Under the Stars.<br />  Love it.  Andre can do no wrong in the music world.  I purchase every new Rieu CD I come across..
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fun &amp;  free just the way I like it. Would be nice if it got progressively harder by automatically adding more suits.
1250006341|5.0|I confess to a guilty pleasure in this series. Downton Abbey is, in my opinion, one of the best Masterpiece Theater productions in years. Julian Fellowes has written a terrific script that compels the viewer's attention. His sister, Jessica, has written a companion volume documenting the era when Downton Abbey takes place and at the same time cover the show's production, settings, actors and costumes.<br />It is a wealth of information for the casual viewer or the dedicated fan. It's well written with page after page of extraordinary photographs and behind-the-scenes tidbits.<br />I thought it was terrific!
B002QS1O36|5.0|I cannot say anything that hasn't been already said,, heaping praise on this award winning beautiful story. The music will stand for a hundred years to come, and letting this be a must watch is my idea of becoming richer for the time spent. I loved it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this App because when u open the app it tells u the percentage of how much batery is left!!! ALL KINDLE FIRE USERS GET THIS APP!!!
B004CYKZZA|1.0|These wireless headphones worked but wouldn't seat around my ears very well.  It was snug around the bottom of my ear and loose around the top.
B0042L78MG|5.0|Love the genre and sway to it as often as I can. She is right up there with Dean Martin.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|.... but this is one I am anxious for each and every episode.  Every time you think it is getting slow, is comes out of nowhere and slaps you in the face.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I like it but it needs more time I need more time to build my batcave and kill other things its very good demo though
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first 2/3 of the book were page turners!  Then there is a lack of Appropriate hate from the husband!  I don't want to give  it away but the ending was lame
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This concert came out recently enough that it has a couple of the groups newer songs (like \\"One Day at a Time,\\"  celebrating Joe Walsh's sobriety) yet is old enough that all the guys still look and sound great! One of my husband and my favorite pastimes is to have a few beers and watch a concert dvd and this is one of our top-five favorites! With two discs of one great song after another, it makes for a great night!
B0064NTZQ2|3.0|I ordered a New condition DVD from Amazon and received one that was obviously Used and scratched. I have encountered this from Marketplace sellers before, but this is the first time that I have observed Amazon do business in this fraudulent manner. It is one thing to get a damaged product, but it is another to get one that is also a product of dishonesty.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent read. This is the second time that I have read it and it never gets old. Loved it!! Thank you!
B005721W9O|4.0|Not bad, great movie. Unfortunately, it does not have mouse interractive features; therefore, does not work that well on a computer. I would have given it 5 stars if it did.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it!!! Can't wait for the next one! I don't know if I could pick a favorite between these two. They are both wonderful!!!!
B0025VLELQ|5.0|Not bad, great movie. Unfortunately, it does not have mouse interractive features; therefore, does not work that well on a computer.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|Nothing wrong with the set, and it was a nice change to see the actors on the commentary tracks again.  I just don't know what the writers are thinking about anymore.  Still, as long as Jared and Jensen stick with the show, I'll stick with it too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love MCPE!!!!!!!!! Its the beast thing in the world!!! nothing is better!!!!!!!! I know its $6.99 but its the best I say dont waste your money on a One Direction elbom, get MCPE instead!!!!!
B007THA4FI|5.0|If you looking for muggles, and magic, you might want to reread Rowling's Harry Potter series because you will not find that here.  What you will find is the same beautifully developed characters who attempt to meet the challenges of their sometimes joyous and sometimes profoundly painful lives.  This story is a tragedy.  And it is not for children.  Kudos J.K.!  Loved every minute of it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game so much I wish I could be in it but this is better than tempel run! !!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #1
B0056C6XIA|5.0|This is a great gift for this christmas and hoping that the recipient would be as amaze as I was when saw it
075669812X|5.0|Beautiful pages. Great additional mini figure.. Got one for my son and then got another for my younger son. this is a great product for a Ninjago Lovers
0545425115|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is an amazing book and great for teens! Katniss, the main character, is a brave, mature, and wise young girl! This book is very fast moving and attention grabbing so you have to read carefully or you will miss key points!
B005HSL626|5.0|Kids love it! This game is fun for the kids and is very easy to play but gets harder as it goes.
078322737X|2.0|I like the movie (story)/acting. The sound that was digitally applied to the DVD, must have been done by someone with no clue how to do their job. There is greast 'DO WOP&#34;, musice tha taccompanies the actors through everyscens. HOWEVER, the music is so loud, it is impossible to hear what the actors are saying, at least 70-80 % of the time.<br />DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PARTICULR VIDEO.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Who doesn't like Angry Birds? We love this game! Fun for all ages, adult to kids. Play it all the time.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I won't go into rating the seasons as previous posters have done because I felt a review of the product itself would be more appropriate since it is specifically the Limited Edition and those purchasing this most likely have already seen the show and have formed their own opinion of it.<br /><br />The special edition is modeled after a zombie that is encountered in the beginning of season 2. It is a zombie that was taken out with a screw driver through the eye.<br /><br />Designed by renowned Todd McFarlane, this is no exception and is fantastically designed and I highly recommend it for fans of the show.The stand that the head boldy states the title of the show \\"Walking Dead\\". It stands firmly with little - no danger of it tipping over like so many do. the head tilts back to reveal both season one & season 2 of \\"The Walking Dead\\". It is very well crafted and looks very life like (or should I say Walking Dead like?..lol). Definitely high quality and a must buy for fans of the show.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Have watched this several times since receiving.  The plot, acting and special effects are all first rate.  It's a keeper for years to come.  Hulk?.....SMASH!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not put the book down.  Just wanted to get to the solution.  As usual John Grisham has done a fantastic job of giving his readers their moneys worth and this time in gold bars.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|I am a Patricia Cornwall fan, especially the Scarpetta series. Always a fantastic read. I find this book more expensive with Amazon than other sites.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Beyond addicted to this game!! No glitches, no freezing, problem free (which is rare these days)! For once, I'm actually rating something with 5 stars :-)
B008IJTFYW|1.0|Pretty bad. Only a few seconds of sound until it loops again. It stops during the pause which is very irritating.
B002XXLKHY|4.0|Well, maybe not. But I'll continue to watch it every year, it is always great for a few good laughs!
B009LUBA7M|4.0|I have always loved his music and have followed his career through the years. His music is  Like wine he gets better with age. Grab it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It was spell binding yet so sad.  I'm sure anyone would greatly enjoy. Very well written.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is the best superhero movie made. The buildup to it was at least 6 movies with major stars. Bringing them together in this movie made it great. If you sit in a theater for about three hours and don't leave your seat, you know it's a good movie. I saw it twice!
B004EPZ08O|5.0|This movie came to me in vert good condition.It is as good as the first 5 and now I have all of them.They are not good for young kids to watch but they still make my heart jump in all the 5 movies.I am very glad I have all of them.
B0058VW36U|3.0|This game is ok...have not spent a lot of time with it yet - but so far it is just ok..
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As usual Nelson DeMille has done an outstanding job with his writing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to friends and foes!
B000FC2ROU|1.0|The message is good, the author has many remarkable quotes, and some passages make you smile with his witty sense of humor, but I did not like the characters, disliked all the absurd happenings and all the unnecessary details that did not add to the story.  Overall, I did not enjoy the story and would not recommend this book to anyone I know.,
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this game is cool because it have different powers<br />plus there are a lot of things that help u pass like a stars wars elefent that shoots
6304765231|4.0|I love this movie, but I think it is slightly over-rated due to Lee's death. The plot is unique and exciting and the action is great, but years ago I remember this being a highly spoken of movie in High School and when I watched it, I really liked it so much to buy it and since I've bought it years ago, I've only seen it once or twice because it doesn't seem like that magnificent movie to me anymore, but it's still really good and a great one to watch around Halloween. It does build up a lot of emotions at times and if Lee had to have one last performance, I'm glad it was this because it's an awesome plot and film overall! I've definitely made sure all my friends have seen it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Overall, this app is very fun and addicting. I recommend you getting it if you like mysteries and games like 'Clue'.
B000Q7Q2WM|5.0|I feel as if people either love or hate Kill Bill and I personally love it. It's supposed to be a cheesy action flick and I think all of the stars did a WONDERFUL job. This is one of my favorite movies both the first and second volume. I honestly thought it looked stupid when it came out in theaters, but when I watched it years later on TV, I loved it and I had to buy it a couple of years after that.<br /><br />Just keep in mind it's going to be cheesy at times, but has a very unique plot that Tarantino & Thurman did wonderful job working on together. There are some amazing quotes as well especially from Bill that I use in every day life, which is a rare thing for me.
B005GWOFO4|5.0|Finally a copy without pops, scratches and surface noise.  Very good dimension and great soundstage.  A clearer and more full bottom end than the original vinyl copies I have.
B007SGM084|5.0|I watched a preview of these books on Dr. Oz and wanted to see what everyone was raving about.  I'm not into the bondage stuff but to read the trilogy was enjoyable.  I looked at the storyline not just the content.  Seems like everywhere I turned someone was reading it. What an imagination.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|I am an Early Interventionist working with children from birth to age 5.  I provide this puzzle activity to children who need to practice:  (1) the fine motor skill of isolating the index finger for use in dragging & dropping;  (2) the cognitive skill of matching a shape's configuration to a corresponding space.  There is also a receptive and expressive communication benefit because the child has motivation to:  listen to verbal cues; speak to tell about his experience.
B005COO1X6|5.0|All I can say is, keep up the good work Stephen King. You never let me down.  Where do you get that imagination???
