B003XKAZK4|4.0|Overall, I loved the cds and couldn't wait to get them.  I wish I had known (didn't see it listed in description anywhere) that this was an edited version.  The swear words have all be 'cleaned' out, and the little rap at the end of Kids has been totally removed.  I only assume the latter is for space.  There may be other songs that are shorter versions, that was just the only one I have noticed so far.  Still a good cd, and worth every penny.  This one will stay in rotation for awhile.
B002ZG99CC|3.0|Although the DVD was cheaper than originally 20, the case and album cover looked cheap.  I didn't know I was paying for a cheaper value.  I just thought the movie was discounted at the time.

B0042RUMEQ|5.0|So when I first heard Drake's \\"Thank Me Later\\"...i'm thinking it was going to be like his guest features...raw, crazy lyrics & dope beats...when I finally bought the Cd, I got all of that but in a toned down manner...The album sound half R&B and half hip-hop...That's exactly how I feel about this album.  I know alot of people would prefer the both of them to just spit crazy hot bars...but I like the fact that they both did some singing on their albums.  I'll say this about Nicki, she does have what it takes to put out a stellar album as evident by all her guest features on other artist's tracks and I think that's exactly what Pink Friday is: Stellar....does that mean it's the best hip-hop album out there?  No.  Does that mean she's the best female Emcee out there?  That's still up for debate, but I for one like her weird personality, the stutter-effect she uses on majority of her tracks, the personalities...I mean, everybody wants music artist to be somewhat original...I think she did just that with this album.  Hate if you want, simply put, people are gonna hate this album and people are gonna like this album...leave it at that.<br /><br />Stand Out Tracks:<br /><br />Moment 4 Life F/Drake<br />Did It On Em'<br />I'm The Best<br />Roman's Revenge F/Eminem<br />Blazin' F/Kanye West<br />Dear Old Nicki
B0043CJ8AY|5.0|This album is really, really good. Of course, you must like Maroon 5 to like this album. To me it's a good balance between the 1st and 2nd albums. And \\"Misery\\" is not the best song of the album, just to give you an idea. Most of the songs are really catchy, and you can listen the whole album in \\"shuffle\\" and won't disappoint. My favorites: \\"Don't Know Nothing\\", \\"Runaway\\", \\"Hands All Over\\".
1593272200|5.0|\\"The Linux Programming Interface\\" is a very comprehensive book targeted at programmers and is concerned with teaching the system calls and library functions provided by the Linux operating system.  It also makes a good Linux programmer's reference book.  So far I have read about one third of the 1500 pages, but I can already say it is one of the best programming books that I have ever encountered.  I had a background in Windows software development with only limited knowledge of Linux programming, and wanted to increase my Linux knowledge.  This book definitely helped with that.  It is well written and well organized with good use of diagrams and code examples.  The preface recommends that readers should already be familiar with programming in general and C programming in particular.
0061743526|4.0|The beginning of the book disappointed me a little, for I had heard so many good things about it, and the plot seemed all over the place and confusing. Also, I found that the dialect in the book was filled with slang, but the narrator used elegant language and the two contradicted each other. As the narrator, Scout, and her brother, Jem, go through their lives in Maycomb County, the plot thickens with a court case accusing a black man of rape, and the county's expectations. The ending was really great, and by the middle I was quite happy with the book and I loved the personality of the little county and all the wonderful characters. I would recommend this book, but advise the reader to keep reading even if the beginning starts slowly, and not judge the book by the first half.
0316098337|5.0|If all you know is life in a single room without windows except for a small skylight in the roof, would you yearn for anything different? This is Jack's life. Jack is a 5 year old living in Room with his mother. You start realizing pretty early on in the book that something's not quite right, although the horror of their lives is only gradually disclosed. Jack only knows life in Room and although he does get to watch TV, he believes that everything on TV is not real. When Jack starts to learn that there are people outside Room who are real, that his mother has a mother and father of her own, the fear of the unknown raises a great deal of anxiety in him.    As they are forced to live in this Room as prisoners, Jack's mother is tireless in building a life in Room that entertains, fascinates and educates her son as best she can, while fiercely protecting Jack from the man who has imprisoned them. While Jack doesn't understand yet that they are prisoners, he's a happy child, but his happiness is contrasted with his mother's occasional quietness as she remembers the life she used to have on the Outside.    Mother and son find a way to escape and what follows is an interesting psychological study in how Jack, having his entire world destroyed, has to learn how to socialize and communicate with others, while learning about the real world they have escaped to. At times he misses Room and wants desperately to return to the place his mother hates. He remembers Room with fondness and it represents his security, while his mother remembers Room the place of her imprisonment, abuse and fear.    This is a page turner, no doubt about it. It makes you contemplate the evil that dwell in some people, the strength and love of a mother for her child and the will to survive.
0525423273|5.0|Anna And The French Kiss is probably one of the best contemporary novels I've ever read. Stephanie Perkins writes a believable romance with completely believable characters to create a novel that was so unbelievably good that I didn't put it down once.<br /><br />Anna Oliphant will go down in history as one of my favorite female characters of all-time. From the very first page, I knew I'd love her. She's quirky and eccentric, but still has plenty of those girly \\"teenage\\" emotions. And I also loved that her and &Eacute;tienne St. Clair, a gorgeous student at her new boarding school, are just best friends for a good chunk of the novel. With a story like this, Perkins could've easily did the whole \\"love at first sight\\" thing, but I'm so glad that she didn't. Another thing I admired was that Anna is not a damsel in distress. St. Clair helps her out a lot, but if anything, I think that she saves him a lot more. It really breaks from the mold of typical YA romance.<br /><br />This is not a perfect, fairy-tale romance either. Anna and St. Clair's relationship has a lot of ups and downs. He's got a serious girlfriend and Anna is still harboring feelings for an old co-worker back in America. But even with those obstacles in the way, the story still progresses, as do their feelings. And it literally leaps off the pages. At times, I would hold the book away from me so that I could squeal/swoon without damaging it!<br /><br />Overall, I have no appropriate words to do justice to how much I loved Anna And The French Kiss. This book is cute, intense, romantic, funny, dramatic and so much more. Even if you're not into contemporary novels, I definitely recommend you check this one out. I think it might just change your mind!
0060507772|5.0|The story itself was all right. But the real beauty of this book was the artwork - being able to see all the characters in full color, which makes this a must-have if you're a fan of Discworld. My favorite part was the story of the minstrel, as told in the pictures: the \\"before\\" picture before they kidnapped him for the trip, and the \\"after\\" picture when he's performing the song he composed for them.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I just wanted to let everyone know about me experience with the Turtle Beach Ear Force X41.  These are probably the best gaming headset I have ever used.  I use them frequently to play COD.  It's nice to be able to hear which direction people, helicopters, and the RC-Xds are coming from.  Some people have complained of popping and clicking coming through the headset.  I haven't had this problem at all since I got them.  The battery life isn't that bad.  I've had them for about 3 weeks now and I'm still using the batteries they come with.  If you can get over their steep price tag they are definantly worth it.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|While listening to  the first couple of songs I was found it very soothing and had a relaxed feeling- not that that's a bad thing, but that American raw sound has been done, and done better than this.   During the next few songs, I could sense a  little British accent, and by the end I really felt drawn into the music. Normally I don't get much into lyrics, but I do notice when the singer gets into a powerful rythym.    This is a unique collection that I dont think you will be disappointed in if you like this type of music.
B00428CPUY|5.0|Many reviews here but, I will only review one track off this great DVD set.     The genius of Jeff Beck is very clear on his version of Nessun dorma, an aria from Giacomo Puccini's opera Turandot.  Of course Jeff has his Guitar sounds arranged pre-song but, from the first note to the last, Jeff steps on no pedals.  Beck turns this classic aria into his own.  His dynamic use of the fret board, tasteful spin of the volume knob & touch of the whammy-bar, are crying out the desperation of Calaf, (the original arias narrator.)  Fellow musicians in the band help Jeff ride this superb music into pure electric bliss heaven! I feel that Jeff adds a unique nuance to this perfect music piece.  I could swear that the spirit's of Luciano Pavarotti is somewhere in the solid body of his Strat & Puccini's is within Beck's fingers.  An absolute fantastic work of music here folks.  Worth the price of admission alone!!! A MUST PURCHASE DVD!
0091933684|5.0|In his introduction to this book, Yotam Ottolenghi writes that that each dish is based around one of his favourite ingredients.  This has led to an idiosyncratic organisation of recipes: some components (such as aubergines) have their own chapter; others are organised botanically (such as brassicas) and others reflect associations that are part of the way Ottolenghi shapes his menus.<br />These recipes are based on meatless dishes and reflect eclectic influences including the Middle East, South East Asia and Latin America.  The book is full of delicious, mouth-watering recipes.<br />The chapter headings may give some idea:<br /><br />Roots<br />Funny Onions<br />Mushrooms<br />Courgettes and Other Squashes<br />Capsicums<br />Brassicas<br />The Mighty Aubergine<br />Tomatoes<br />Leaves Cooked and Raw<br />Green Things<br />Green Beans<br />Pulses<br />Cereals<br />Pasta, Polenta, Couscous<br />Fruit with Cheese<br /><br />The recipes are accompanied by anecdotes and by mouth-wateringly beautiful photographs. The instructions are clear and easy to follow.  The amount of preparation required varies between dishes: some are quick and easy, others will require more time.  But it's worth it. There is a recipe here for just about any occasion.<br /><br />I first borrowed this book from the library, but quickly realised that I needed my own copy.<br /><br />A note for American readers: the ingredients are listed in grams and millilitres rather than cups and ounces.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B001E57SH8|5.0|Like other reviewers, after getting this butane lighter I found that it only would light one out of 3 or 4 times. (Yes I used Zippo Butane Fuel, Purged the lighter completely before filling, waited 1-2 seconds with gas flowing before striking the wheel...) THEN I tried 5X highly refined butane fuel \\"Power\\" brand, (cheaper than Zippo by the way...) and not only does this puppy light EVERYTIME but the flame is consistently 2x larger. Zippo makes a great lighter but my experience suggests their Butane is of poor quality and, as a result, creating a band name for their new \\"Blu\\" line of lighters, especially since they highly recommend using only their fuel. The other thing, and this is true of most Butane lighters, is that temperature makes a difference. If you allow the flame to burn for more than a few seconds the body of the unit gets cold from the endothermic reaction of a liquid going to a gas phase. The drop of temperature decreases the gas pressure inside the lighter. Heating the unit in your hand (or keeping it in a pocket) will restore the pressure loss and translate to a much larger flame after a few moments of warming. Once I figured out the fuel issue I am very pleased with this product!
B0042JTDXK|4.0|Wow, I did not realize this album had polarized fans as the reviews appear to indicate!    I have enjoyed Josh's music for years and really do love his \\"booming baritone.\\" While I agree that his voice is more suited to operatic-type pieces in a variety of languages, I'm finding that the styling of several of the songs on this album do showcase his range and emotion, particularly Bells of NY City and Love Only Knows.    This album tries to please everyone -- songs that start with a simple acoustic guitar inevitably end up with soaring strings. I understand Josh's desire to step out a bit and believe that he CAN, but that someone was trying to hard to please the fans who appreciate the huge orchestral accompaniments we're used to on previous albums.    That being said, the more I listen to this album, the more I WANT to hear it. I noticed that people have reacted negatively to his \\"falsetto\\" in some songs. I find it poignant and very suited to the mood. It's one of the things I like best about this album! I'm pleased to see his vocal and song-writing range and hope that the next album can cross the bridge a little better.
0399536108|5.0|So many self-help, motivational, \\"pursue your dreams,\\" \\"work for yourself,\\" be independent and be successful type books are 99.9% about being healthy and wealthy and .1% about making the world a better place maybe, someday, if you get around to it.<br /><br />Chris Guillebeau's book is written from real-world experience, so it's practical and realistic - and most importantly, there's a social good component incorporated all the way through. Changing the world for the better is not an after-thought for Chris, it's baked into the whole pie. And that's why this book is different - and better - than a lot of the other books you could buy. Get this one first!
B0002BO05S|1.0|Because the author the book by the same title attempts to merge the Gospels, he takes the libery of altering the Gospel accounts and adding superfluous dialogue to \\"round out the characters\\" in a way that is irreverent of Christ and misinterpreting key passages of Scripture.  Judas hung himself, he didn't kill himself in a fire!  Come on, seriously!  This movie has its moments, but the odd \\"hallelujah chorus\\" after the raising of Lazarus was not appropriate, and inserting Apostle Paul into this is not historically verifiable and a gross exaggeration on the part of the author.  If the author had not contradicted what the Bible clearly records as having happened, I may have been more willing to accept his creativity in other areas.
0525423273|4.0|I think I might be slipping. First it was Justin in [[ASIN:080509010X Harmonic Feedback]], then Nico in [[ASIN:1416991689 Chasing Brooklyn]], and now it is just so very much &Eacute;tienne St. Clair in ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS. I am falling under the spell of the nice guys and I really have very little to say for myself except this: I am charmed. Utterly charmed. My feelings on the fictional boys and the many flavors they come in are usually quite set. When a love triangle is involved, I can generally be found over in the bad boy camp. But these books I've read recently are just beautifully free of triangles and feature the genuine article as far as the boys go, allowing me to freely admire their charms. Which I have been doing. And believe you me, this latest one will waltz away with your heart. I've been looking forward to reading ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS for quite some time now, ever since the spectacular reviews started churning out and I got that little knowing feeling in my gut. You know the one. It whispers of good things ahead and lures you with the promise of a reader/book match made in heaven. Or at the very least, in Paris. This release marks Stephanie Perkins' debut and it is a delightful one. I'm anxious and excited to see where she goes from here.<br /><br />Anna Oliphant is being packed off to France without so much as a by-your-leave. Her famous and fatuous father has decided she should attend the prestigious School of America boarding school in Paris for her senior year of high school. Since her parents are divorced and her dad holds the purse strings, there is very little to be done about the whole thing but pack her bags, hug her friends goodbye, and leave Atlanta for the big unknown. Without a word of French under her belt, Anna arrives at her new school frightened and unsure of herself. Fortunately, her next door neighbor Meredith takes her under her wing and introduces her to her small circle of friends, including smart Rashmi, her goofy-but-talented boyfriend Josh, and one &Eacute;tienne St. Clair--known to one and all simply as St. Clair. Anna has it pretty bad right from the start. You see St. Clair is kind of killing it in the attractive and interesting department. He's got the messy hair. He's got the English accent. He's funny and smart and up for anything. And the two of them hit if off immediately. But there is a fly in the ointment. Naturally. He also has a longtime girlfriend at a nearby college. And their mutual friend Meredith is in love with him. Which rather clearly spells steer clear for poor Anna. She resolves to be his friend when he needs her and focus on the amazing city she's come to live in, her growing film review site, and that boy back home she always wondered about. After all, it is the right and sensible thing to do. Isn't it?<br /><br />This book has everything going for it. A smart and relatable heroine, who has been thrust into an equal parts extremely enviable and most distressing situation. A handsome, short (!), boy with an accent, who is genuinely kind and thoughtful and attracted to our girl something fierce. A simply gorgeous setting, complete with lush descriptions of its food, sights, sounds, and smells. And a conflict that builds up to Eiffel Tower proportions before either of them can figure out what in the world to do about it. In other words, reading ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS is like plopping down on the couch with a mug of hot chocolate, a plate of buttered toast, and nowhere else you need to be for hours. It's an perfectly pleasant read, the kind of contemporary young adult novel you're always looking for. The romance is divine, the characters so very real, and the atmosphere second to none. I did find myself wishing at times for a little more insight on Anna's part with regards to the obviously lackluster Toph and her need to be with him. But, you know, I admired the mature way she handled her friendship with a boy she was in love with and couldn't have. How manyof us handle that with anything resembling poise in high school? And the nice thing is, I found myself frustrated with St. Clair at certain parts as well. I like that Stephanie Perkins carefully crafted such a swoon-worthy character and simultaneously had the guts to leave the flaws in as well. Because when one of the two characters is perfect, what need has s/he for the other? These two need each other. They make mistakes and they vacillate. It's messy and drawn out and hanging by a thread. And I wasn't always sure leading up to the end whether they deserved each other or not. But I wanted them to. And, in the end, it was just right. I loved it. Treat yourself to a sweet little confection for the holiday season and pick up a copy soon.hing resembling poise in high school?

B001992NW4|5.0|The Exorcist is without question the most frightening film ever made. The very best of the slasher films with all their bloody shocks & thrills never remotely approach the much deeper layer of profoundly disturbing, soul scorching horror that The Exorcist masterfully conveys. For decades this film has easily topped the vast majority of \\"greatest horror movies of all time\\" lists. The sequels were crap and don't belong in the same league as this original masterpiece. The studio obviously spent the necessary time and money on the blu ray transfer that a film of this stature merits. If you believe in God and the existence of spiritual good and evil (as most of us Americans do) then this movie packs a psychological wallop like no other. Approach with caution and definitely don't let immature children view this film (as though it's just another run of the mill horror flick). It's not.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games), by Suzanne Collins<br /><br /> I was so excited when I opened up the box I got from UPS today; especially when I saw that I had received the rest of the books in the Hunger Games trilogy (They were on sale for $9 each! In hardback!). I started the second one immediately, and within' 3 and a half hours I had read from cover to cover. And Ms. Collins takes the series exactly where I had hoped they'd go: Revolution!<br /><br /> This book starts just a short time before the winners of the previous year's Hunger Games start on a tour of the 12 Districts, an activity that happens every year midway between each year's Games. Before they can head out, though, Katniss is treated to a brief sit-down with the President, where he chides her for her rebellious actions during the previous Games, and tells her to tone it down; he is not above killing the people she loves in order to forestall a rebellion.<br /><br /> And so she again plays the part of a love-sick girl, in the attempt to portray her actions as madness brought about by her love for Peeta, rather than a calculated rebellion against the Capital. Unfortunately, the people don't care what she wants them to believe, and start their own District by District insurrection using her as a figurehead.<br /><br /> The Government wants her dead, but they fear what will happen if they just up and execute her, so they rig the next Games (the 75th, and so a special Games anyway) against her and Peeta: All those chosen to fight will be chosen from previous years' winners. And so Katniss and Peeta find themselves fighting in the Hunger Games yet again!<br /><br /> I really look forward to seeing how the trilogy is concluded in the next book. I will probably read it and have a review up early next week!<br /><br />Memorable Quote:<br /><br /> At some point during the prep, each of [my prep crew] bursts into tears at least twice, and Octavia pretty much keeps up a running whimper throughout the morning. It turns out they really have become attached to me, and the idea of my returning to the arena has undone them. Combine that with the fact that by losing me they'll be losing their ticket to all kinds of big social events, particularly my wedding, and the whole thing becomes unbearable. The idea of being strong for someone else having never entered their heads, I find myself in the position of having to console them. Since I'm the person going in to be slaughtered, this is somewhat annoying.<br /><br />For more reviews like this visit [...]oughout the morning.

B001PPLKI0|5.0|This is a wonderful album, and I believe it's Elvis at his best. The background singers are terrific on several of the songs.  I recently purchased this album as a gift.  If you like gospel music and Elvis, this is a must have.

030726999X|1.0|Unless you want to totally waste your time wading through an 800+ page book that is pure garbage, don't bother with Hornet's Nest.  After slogging through some of the most boring, silly distractions from the main plot in the history of Western Literature (and Eastern as well.  And interplanetary literature too I am sure, if there are intelligent civilizations out there), this alleged book ends with the most ineptly written, least credible courtroom scene in the history of, etc.  Admittedly, I know nothing of Swedish courtroom procedures, but surely they consist of some sort of Q and A instead of the attorney repeatedly delivering set speeches, most of which consisti almost entirely of  rank hearsay, telling the witness why he lied, sometimes even before he said anything at all.  And there is absolutely no drama to the courtroom scenes, because Larsson already told the reader at insufferable length precisely how the conspiracy against Salander went down.  Plus, there are more characters in this book than in War and Peace -- I may be wrong, but I think some of the War and Peace characters made guest appearances in this book -- most of whom are totally unnecessary, being completely interchangeable with other characters.<br /><br />Larsson could have ended The Girl Who Played With Fire with about 100 additional  pages (certainly no more) that would tie up the loose ends.  They are briefly (as a public service, I am about to reveal what for lack of a better word I shall call \\"plot\\") -- the Section (the rogue elements of Sapo) kills Zalachenko and set out to reinstitutionalize Salander.  They fail, Millennium exposes their decades of dastardly doings, and Salander is exonerated.  That is the sum total of what is new in this book.  Everything else is totally unnecessary.  Makes you wonder if Larsson was getting paid by the word.  Or (here's a conspiracy theory), if the book was written by someone OTHER than Larsson to discredit him before bumping him off.  Hmm, maybe Mikael Blomqvist should look into that.<br /><br />It's a shame Larsson had to go out on such a low note.  The first two books were well worth reading.  This isn't worth the trees that died for its publication.  Had he lived, Larsson would have had a tough job digging himself out of the muck of this book to retain his audience for additional books in the series.<br /><br />I can think of no other instance where an author fell off his stride so much.  Writer's block would have been vastly superior to this.ist should look into that.    It's a shame Larsson had to go out on such a low note.  The first two books were well worth reading.

0385738757|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the Mazerunner and have waited a year to read this second installment in the series. I wasn't disappointed! Dashner does an amazing job drawing the reader into the story by starting off exactly where he left the first one. I don't want to say too much and spoil the first book for those who haven't read it, but the Scorch Trials is just as mind-puzzling as the Mazerunner. You can never guess what Dashner will throw at Thomas and the other Gladers next. With some new character developments and a devilish plot, this one is hard to put down.
B0041T7FS6|5.0|Being a stone Chic fan, it didn't faze me one bit when it came to purchasing this collection of Chic/Chic-written/Chic-produced tunes.  For me, out of all the stellar tunes in this collection, was the rare 12\\" Mix of \\"My Forbidden Lover\\" on Disc 2.  I stumbled into it on YouTube and was glad to find it available!  Other jewels for me, personally were \\"High Society\\" performed by Norma Jean Wright (just try and find the Norma Jean Wright CD - it will still cost you plenty for a used copy!), and the Carly Simon \\"Why\\" in it's full 8+ minute format (my personal favorite by Ms. Simon!).  There's something for everyone (Chic, that is...)!<br /><br />Find yourself a copy at a good price and celebrate!<br /><br />I rate this collection: 5 stars!
B002G01EPC|5.0|at first I thought this figure would be brittle and delicate when bending in the waist, the arms, the neck, and legs. I'm surprised this figure is able to hold up in such bizarre poses and stay in those poses without collapsing over or snapping it's joints. If you like Dragon Ball Z or just like this character, or even like figures that are 1/12 scale then this figure is right down your alley.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|We had such high hopes for this so called 'thriller', instead we were subject to too  much nudity, no plot, very little dialogue, just a dumb movie all around.  He has done such good work, and wasted his time with this one.  At the end of this movie I can tell you that the majority of the movie goers in our theater, said, 'Thank God, that one is over!\\".. We actually laughed with each other at spending our money on such an awful movie.  Throughout most of the movie we kept saying, is this going anywhere?  Well, it didn't, it just got worse.  I have not seen such an awful film in a long time due to the fact that I watch reviews closely and I am not sure the great reviews given here were for the same movie!  Don't waste your time.
0545265355|5.0|I work in a library and kept hearing about the Hunger Games trilogy.  I decided to buy it for my 17 year old granddaughter for Christmas, but decided that I should read it myself first.  I have read the first book and could not put it down.  It is a very timely and very emotional. An excellent choice for a young adult, but us golden oldies will love it, too.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I really enjoyed Graceling quite a bit...I ususally don't go in for the female lead character, but this one had a lot of great action going for it. This feisty warrior is definitely not one to be trifled with and there are several other interesting characters who round out the story well. In all, a very entertaining fantasy novel that I highly recommend!
B00493AD74|2.0|I can't really add anything to the growing list of observations made by the mostly exasperated viewers of this film. A day after I watched this self-indulgent b.s., for some reason the movie Silkwood popped into my head, and I longed to see Cher sitting on that porch swing, giving the performance of a life time as Dolly Polliker. The observations of a poor lesbian in Texas may not sound like something that would present a transformational moment, but it moved me to tears; something that this movie could only hope to aspire to do in its dreams. If you want to wash away the memory of his disappointing performance in E.P.L., I suggest that you re-watch Milk to remind yourself of what tenderness James Franco is capable of portraying. Richard Jenkins gives the only authentic performance in this movie- not sure if it's worth slogging through an hour and twenty minutes to get to, but it's definitely the most moving part. If you want to go on a journey of real forgiveness and redemption try Big Fish. Billy Crudup,(the much- maligned caricature of a husband) gets a chance to shed the years of animosity he's felt towards his father by taking a trip through the fantastic stories he's spun over the years, in the hopes of de-bunking them all, only to discover that there's a grain of truth in every one. If you want to watch a movie that will inspire you to re-evaluate your relationships and then do everything that you can to create authentic connections within them, this is the one.
0374158460|3.0|It's a lot to think about, but keeps you reading.  I found myself frustrated, sad, and sometimes blushing.  I am 27 years old, probably not the target reader, but I have to say I finished it and am still on the fence.  But maybe thats the point...take the chance I would say.
0374158460|2.0|This was my first Franzen novel and upon conclusion, I could not figure out what all the hullabaloo was about. It's quite a herculean task to write a novel in this manner yet still produce generic characters. The one-dimensional players in the story subsumed any profound kernels present.    It almost seemed like the book was designed as a screenplay with the actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Walter) in mind. The couple's young-adult son wasn't much deeper than Michael J. Fox's character on \\"Family Ties\\". And, Poor Patty--a study in cardboard only to be surpassed by the stick figured Lalitha.    I'm a bit astounded that professional critics think that this novel accurately portrays the inner-life of a certain subset of Americans. The novel rings hollow across its entirety.    On the positive side, it's a harmless and easy read.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I bought this DVD for the Hachi story because I love animals in general. Animals are the most honest creatures more than human. I really treasure my pets at home. That's why I believe that animals have rights to be respected and loved by human.<br /><br />I understand that dogs are the most clever and sincere animal that really can be faithful for a long term friendship, and how lucky a person to be loved by this animal. Its a very unique feelings that every animal has with his owner. dogs teach us a big lesson in life to be faithful to whom we love the most, to be always remembered every seconds in our life, to express the affections in a simple action but with a big meanings of it. they don't need to pretend because every thing they do they express it genuinely. How beautiful when I see love in my pets eyes and behavior. Very honest animal I wish that people could have the smallest part of their honesty. We will live definitely in peace and quiet.<br /><br />Its very very touching and said story, made me really really weep inside my heart and also eyes. I recommend it to those people who love animals, and have this passion about animals, its sad at the end but it will show you that you have the heart to feel this animal and learn something precious through experiencing watching its story.

0060734191|5.0|I had a little bit of difficulty beginning this trilogy, but I'm so glad that I did. Nix has penned an exceptional fantasy that blends high fantasy with the zombie novel and mixes in a little bit of World War II type technology for a reading experience that never ceases to keep your interest. When I got to the second novel, I stalled a little again, unable to see where direction was going because there's a total change of main characters and a time jump, but a little patience is well worth the reward. The last novel takes up immediately where Lirael leaves off and comes to a stunning finale...highly recommended!
B0011Z3334|5.0|As a 48 year old who spent many years playing in bands myself, I was starting to think that picking up an actual instrument and learning to play was a soon to be lost art. Some kids actually think that playing Guitar Hero or Rock Band makes them a musician. Hint: NOT!!!<br />Then I found Paramore... These kids are good... Real good... And they have let me know that Rock music isn't going anywhere just yet.<br />Riot! is a great place to start if you are new to Paramore, there isn't a bad song on the album. \\"That's What You Get\\" is as catchy as they come, \\"When It Rains\\" shows the band has a softer side and \\"Misery Business\\" just flat out rocks!<br />I haven't had the chance to see them live yet, but I will when I can.<br />Give this album a chance, you won't be disappointed.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|I've read all the books, seen all the movies (to date) and this one was good but definitely not the best of them.  I do have to confess that its been awhile since I read the book, but I was scratching my head through part of this movie trying to figure out where some of the scenes came from.  Whether this is from faulty memory or drastic changes from the book, I'm not quite sure.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar with the Harry Potter series, they should be read/watched in sequence without skipping around.  To do otherwise is to miss out on a lot of important plot details.  Its also important to note that the books have vastly more detail and help explain some things the movies do not so I recommend reading the books to help fill some of these holes in the movies.<br /><br />Harry Potter had lived with his aunt and uncle and their spoiled son when one day he discovers he is a wizard and can attend the magical school of Hogwarts.  Harry has a sad past though, his parents were killed by an evil wizard and throughout the books, that wizard keeps trying to come back and kill Harry.  This wizard, Voldemort, has finally regained power and taken over the world.  Harry, and his two friends Hermione and Ron set out to find the last of the Horcruxes, talismen that hold a part of Voldemort's soul and are the key to killing him once and for all.  Their journey is not easy, and they are pursued at every step, betrayed, and even injured.  In addition to this, they have to cope with their feelings for each other and maintain their friendship.<br /><br />Since it only covers half of the book, this movie largely focuses on Harry and the gang trying to find some of the horcruxes without going into any real battle.  There are a couple squirmishes so fighting is not totally ruled out in this movie.  The fighting can be brutal and may scare some younger viewers.  Some of the characters are just plain creepy as well.  Bellatrix especially, she gives me shivers.<br /><br />Ron really took a shining role in this movie.  He was witty and showed a wide range of emotion.  Hermione of course was her perfect self, but even she was allowed to fly off the handle a bit.  Harry was stoic and set upon his task, but I do think they could have given him a few more bits of happiness in the movie than they did.  Comic relief was far and few between in this dark movie.  Which is not necessarily bad, but could make the movie a bit heavy for some viewers.  The rest of the characters were all played well and very believable.  Its nice that they really tried to find the perfect person for each part and it makes the movie that much more relatable to the books.<br /><br />My only complaints with the movie are that some of the scenes were longer than necessary.  I realize character development is important, but after awhile, watching them trudge around with their tent got a little boring and I would have liked to see the pace pick up a bit or even some of those scenes cut.  Yes, the book may have had that as well, but movie going is a very different animal than book reading, and some things should be changed to reflect that.  In addition, I was also a bit disappointed they cut out the devlopment of Kreacher in the movie when he played such a huge role in the book.  It seems to me they could have had more of that and less of tent trudging.<br /><br />For the more technical aspects of the movie, the special effects and cinematography were great.  Even better than the previous movies in my opinion. I especially loved the tree outside the Lovegood's home. The music is always wonderful and really fit with the tone of the movie.<br /><br />It was a wonderful movie though and mostly faithful to the book.  I would take a guess that any fan of Harry Potter will probably enjoy this movie.  Now I just have to wait for the much anticipated finale.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2010ovie.

B000F39MAQ|2.0|This is a very atypical production of an old Verdi vintage.<br />It is a figurative version, and if you do not already familiarise yourself with the script, can lead to serious misunderstanding of this work.<br />As far as modern day popular entertainment goes, this production deserves 5 full stars.<br />As an operatic production, a mere two.<br />The reasons are obvious. The direction took the story totally out of context. The production is minimalist, and if there is no soprano as attractive as Anna Netrebko, this production would have been a big flop for sure, as did the MET in the more recent years with another good Russian soprano.<br />Musically, the voice of Anna Netrebko is ecstatically beautiful and full. But that's about all there is for her 'portrayal' - very little characterisation. Whether one would prefer a Cortrubas or Freni in the title role's singing is very much a matter of taste, at least as far as the First Act goes. Netrebko negotiates the wild coloraturas with bravura and her young and vibrant soprano is a plus, perhaps a tad too full and healthy for a consumptive patient. Her acrobatic ability adds much to her acting prowess, if not entirely in the correct track. Not so much in the later Act, where she is only partially able to convey the conflict and pathos in the long confrontation with Thomas Hampson. Hampson is similarly vocally bland in this Act, and offered no assistance.<br />In the final Act, the duets between Alfredo and Violetta were done a trifle too robustly then is otherwise warranted dramatically.<br />Rolando Villazon, at the onset of his stardom, demonstrated a passionate way of interpreting the role that carries dramatic conviction, if not totally suave vocally.

B001P9KR8U|3.0|I feel like I'm one of the few people who read the book before seeing the movie.  I really liked the book - very intricate subplots that tied together at the end.  This movie is very very loosely based on the book.  The movie pretty much just took the premise and created a new story with it.  The movie was so different from the book that I was not disappointed.  The movie was fast-paced and very entertaining.  I really loved the music too (will probably check out the soundtrack now).  But I just did not think it lived up to the hype, especially the Best Picture Award.  Good movie, but also read the book - it's better!

B004AUGJS8|5.0|ALL THINGS GOOD is a polished little film based on a true story that while it may not have the visual gruesome detail of the usual thriller tropes of films, it is terrifying in its presentation of personality variations that produce a shuddering reaction on a purely intellectual level for the audience. It is both a love story and a missing persons/murder mystery based on a still unsolved case that continues to haunt New York investigators and reporters and detectives. What writers Marcus Hinchey and Marc Smerling have created from known and newly discovered facts, speculation and court records results in a psychological examination of a powerful New York family, obsession, love and loss. The film relates incidents that began in 1972 and end in 2003 and at this time the truth is still unknown. Director Andrew Jarecki uses a superb cast and a fine sense of voice-over narration to interweave the puzzling history with the gradual dissolution of each of the characters involved.<br /><br />Sanford Marks (Frank Langella) is one of the wealthiest owners of Manhattan real estate, the current head of a family that has long dominated the New York scene with its power and money. Marks is aging and is relying on his son David (Ryan Gosling) to take over the family business: he sends David out to the brothels, and filthy hotels and porn houses to collect rent. David is reticent to be a part of his father's business: he is a deeply disturbed young man, having witnessed his mother's suicide leap as a child. David meets a tenant in one of the properties - Katie McCarthy (Kirsten Dunst) who longs to go to medical school but at present has no income to support that dream. The chemistry between the two is magnetic and despite David's father's objection that Katie is not of 'their kind of people', David decides to marry Katie and move to Vermont to open a Health Foods store - a move that makes the couple ectsatic, but is financed by Sanford Marks who eventually convinces David to sell his haven and move to New York to stay with the family business.<br /><br />In their Manhattan home (and in their country lake front home!) the couple flourishes until Katie mentions she'd like to have children - a force that drives David back into violent behavior resulting form his witnessing his mother's suicide: David can't understand why Katie would want anything but the obvious life of wealth they enjoy. The shell is cracked and the subsequent events include Katie becoming pregnant only to be forced by David to terminate the pregnancy, Katie's disappearance after uncovering the facts about the sources of wealth of the family, David's descent into drugs and irresponsible behavior, and ultimately his leaving New York for Galveston, Texas where he lives a life disguised as a woman, his only friend being another old runaway Melvin Bump (Philip Baker Hall) who David engages to do away with a 'problem confidant' (Lilly Rabe), after which Bump is killed and dissected and tossed into the river. The murders are never solved nor is the mystery of Katie' disappearance. A trial (the source of the voice-over throughout the film has been the lawyer's interrogation of David in the year 2003) fails to resolve anything and the film ends with the message that David Marks is at present a real estate broker in Florida.<br /><br />Frank Langella is superb as the heartless father who drives his family like cattle in the quest of power and wealth. Ryan Gosling offer a multifaceted performance of the deeply disturbed David and is match by Kirsten Dunst's bravura performance as Katie, the simple bright girl whose life is quashed by a powerful family's sickness. The brilliant cast, including the performances by Philip Baker Hall and Lilly Rabe - daughter of the deceased Jill Clayburgh), has excellent cameo roles by Diane Venora, Trini Alvarado, David Margulies, Nick Offerman and many more. This is a tough film to watch because at the bottom of it all is that it is true and the cases areunsolved. It makes us cringe but it is a very fine film.s cringe but it is a very fine film.

As an international graduate student, I usually get frustrated seeing how easier is for native speakers to prepare better presentations in less time. This book is an excellent collection of tips and strategies that can help to overcome the difficulties related to present in English.    Compared to other books on the subject, I've found Wallwork's approach more effective, since it is specifically targeted to non-native speakers. The book is written clearly, and addresses the most commonly made mistakes. The section on the \\"useful phrases\\" is awesome.    Definitely, a great book!
038073186X|4.0|This is a highly original thriller with gothic overtones. Taking place in 1954, it is quite atmospheric and redolent of the times. The writing is taut, and the suspense is palpable. With many twists and turns the reader is pulled in, slowly but surely, into a virtual labyrinth of a mystery.<br /><br />When United States Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, arrive on Shutter Island, little does Teddy know how utterly puzzling his visit will become. He is there to visit a hospital for the criminally insane to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Rachel Solando, a killer who escaped from a locked guarded room.<br /><br />During his visit, strange little tidbits of information come to the fore, and nothing appears to be quite what it seems. Even the common place seems to take on sinister overtones, as Teddy pushes his investigation. His own past seems to have some bearing on the events that transpire.  Even his partner seems to be a tad off the mark.<br /><br />Just what is going on at Shutter Island? The author will lead the reader a merry and complex chase, as one layer after another s peeled back to reveal the truth behind Shutter Island and Teddy's investigation.
B003PIUBZS|1.0|I purchased this series based on the good reviews - bad decision.  I ended up only watching 3 episodes and then stopped.  This is not Rome or anything close to it.  It's a cheap production that has some dim-witted actor playing Spartacus when the historical Spartacus was far more.  Don't waste your time with this series - read Barry Strauss's book.
0312600844|1.0|I struggled to find a reason to like this book as I slowly wended my way through the first 503 pages.  The character flaws I would have liked most about the people in this story were left unexplored and I had a very hard time buying into the events that set the course for each character's twisted life path.  The title is \\"Freedom\\" and it should have been \\"Mired\\" as the freedoms these characters fail to embrace and celebrate were lost in the painfully uninteresting storyline.    You know what?  I'm bored writing this review because I was bored reading the first 503 pages of this book.  Only at the very end did I start to feel something, but by then Franzen had cashed in every chit I was willing to spare him.  Overall: stilted prose. thin characters. unrealistic events. boring omniscience.

B002ZG997M|5.0|Movie - 4.5    I've never been much of a religious person. And when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought to myself, \\"well, Denzel can be pretty bad ass, but this whole Christian vibe has me a bit iffy. I hope it doesn't end up feeling pretentious or anything.\\" Thankfully, the Hughes Brothers and company managed to surprise me. After finally getting to see the film in theaters, I liked it a lot. The story takes place in a post-Apocalyptic future where Earth has been scorched by war into a barren wasteland and humanity has degraded itself into packs of scavengers and nomads who kill, and even eat, each other just to survive. Enter Eli (Denzel Washington), a man on a mission traveling west to deliver what is apparently the very last copy of the King James Holy Bible. On his journey he comes across a man named Carnegie (Gary Oldman) who is looking for the very same book. But sensing the ill intentions in Carnegie's plan to use it, Eli refuses to give up the book and must fight his way through with the help of a young girl, Solara (Mila Kunis). Thematically speaking, the movie itself isn't so much about Christianity (like I was afraid it would be), but the power of faith and the implied applicability of religion. Being an atheist, I always found it irksome that religion was so misinterpreted and taken out of context and that people were so vehement about it that I decided to stop believing in it altogether. In The Book of Eli, however, I find it refreshing that they can offer such a bold perspective on what it really means to follow in what you believe. Religion was never about which god is the right one or where it all originally started. It was simply about learning, finding something to believe in, possibly teaching and passing it down, and proceeding to pursue those beliefs with your own conviction. Mix bits and pieces of that with some stunning action sequences and a great cast of opposing actors and you've got a pretty good film. By the way, don't letthe premise and symbolic inclination fool you. While I, personally, found the quasi-theological undertones enlightening, it's still choreographed by Jeff Imada (most famous for the Bourne films), so take from that what you will. Sci-fi actioners with a message -- gotta' love 'em.    Video - 5.0     I remember seeing this in theaters and thinking that the film quality had a peculiar darkness to it. I was hoping the photography would present itself a little better on BD, and I was right. The movie is very desaturated (as briefly touched upon in the extras) and doesn't have much vibrancy at all until the end of the film. Something like 50-70% of the color scheme was intentionally made to almost monochromatic or like a black and white picture. But in exchange for that drabness, black levels and contrast have an amazing amount of depth and clarity. A lot of the backgrounds were digitally shot or painted and incorporated into the filming and it really, really shows in this transfer. You can see all sorts of fine detail from the little grains of sand in the ground or blowing through the air, the individual follicles and oil reflections from Eli's beard, the dirt and grime on peoples' faces, skin wrinkles and imperfections, notches and kinks in metallic structures, you name it. Backgrounds look especially bleak and reflect the mood of the production design well with ominous cloud cover and very low lighting. Getting back to the black levels, these are among the best I've seen on BD to date. In the scene where Eli fights off the thugs in the underpass you can see his silhouette perfectly, but even better, still make out individual shapes and textures in his clothes and backpack despite the darkness of the tunnel. And best of all, there's very little noise in any of the dark or low-lit scenes. I've never seen anything so immaculately black. Furthermore, black levels make for some great scenic shots that help to compliment the brooding nature of the film itself. One of my favorite shots in the movie (from an aesthetic viewpoint anyway) is when Eli is walking on the destroyed overpass with the camera looking at him from below. Something about the angle of the shot and obvious aftermath of what the wars did to the world is frightening to think about, but at the same time very cool sci-fi stuff. There's very little to complain about in this video transfer, if anything at all, outside of your own personal preference for coloring. What a great effort by WB on this one.    Audio - 5.0     The Book of Eli is an a word - aggressive. From the opening forest sequence we get a steady dose of ambient bass as the camera pans across displaying the state of the world and result of our own destruction via the war that ended civilization. The wind howls eerily along the front sound stage right before Eli shoots his arrow into his soon-to-be dinner as a somewhat jarring thump emanates from the bow. We're then introduced to some of the film's score with an ethereal-sounding piece composed by Atticus Ross during the flash of the movie's title. Afterward, Eli comes upon an abandoned house looking to seek shelter as he kicks the door in and produces an even more jarring LFE. As he searches the house, all the little creaks and cringes of the old wood spread and separate amongst the front and rears. When he settles down for the night, his mp3 player gives us a little of Al Green's \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,\\" a soothing piece of soul that's definitely a contrast to the world Eli lives in, but makes for a good listen once we get to hear a part of it in full lossless surround. But if you want action, the underpass fight is where things start to make themselves heard. Reverberation is stunning when Eli steps back into the shadows and takes out each of those thugs with his \\"samurai machete.\\" Limbs get sliced and bodies impaled with bloody cold execution, while the chainsaw guy, despite his loud and powerful hardware, basically acts as a test dummy for a rather large blade. But the real highlight of this precision soundtrack is in the town shootout. Guns are fired from a multitude of heights and angles with absolutely zero music resulting in a very impressive display of directionality and dynamics as bullets fly from the right front to left rear, right rear to left front, and any number of combinations therein. Shots echo with deadly accuracy and is probably one of the best shootouts I've heard in a while. The action then comes to a close during another big shootout at the old couple's house. Here we get to hear a good amount of automatic weapons fire, a bomb, a bazooka, and a Gatling gun. It's a pretty awesome sound design.    Extras - 4.0    We start off with Maximum Movie Mode as the movie plays itself like normal with bits and pieces of behind-the-scenes footage dispersed throughout and little Focus Points icons at certain parts. You push enter on your controller there and it takes you to a separate screen that breaks down whatever aspect they're attempting to explain (usually in 3-4 minute segments). It's a big mix of production design, writing, filming, and commentary about what the cast and crew wanted to achieve in terms of literary themes, symbolism, and entertainment. I actually played the movie at 1.5x speed to make things a little faster but still slow enough to where I could re-watch the film itself while somewhat conserving time. And while the Focus Points can be accessed as a standalone feature (34 minutes worth, total), I still stand by the opinion that watching these during the movie itself adds a good deal of real-time context and perspective to the on-screen action, which is a very cool variation of the Picture-in-Picture track. Next is a 5-minute motion comic (\\"A Lost Tale: Billy\\") that gives a little bit of background information on Carnegie's childhood. It's short, but a good revelation and indicator as to the motivations we see in his current state during the movie. After that is a 13-minute feature (\\"Starting Over\\") talking about some the story's themes, comparing that world to ours, and discussing the symbolism in what it means to truly start over from scratch. \\"Eli's Journey\\" (about 18-minutes) analyzes the character of Eli himself the production of the film, the casting of Denzel, various collaborations and writing points, and the character's motivations. Both of these features are diced and served in parts throughout Maximum Movie Mode, but feel much more in-depth when watched as complete segments. And then finally is \\"'The Book of Eli' Soundtrack,\\" which shows a sit-down interview with composer Atticus Ross and co-director Allen Hughes. I was expecting this to delve more into theme composition or instrumentation, but it turned out to be just a session of praise from Hughes and a little bit of confirmation by Ross. Altogether, it amounts just over an hour of extras.    Overall - 4.5    The Book of Eli is a movie that interests me a lot. I was never big on religion, but I like how this film in particular highlighted the context of religion, or faith in general, as a personal driving force rather than as a branch of organized control (which it seems more approximated to be nowadays). It's difficult to explain, though I can say it's certainly given me something of a new perspective on things. Denzel Washington never ceases to amaze me, and it was a delight to see him opposite Gary Oldman. With a philosophical approach to society and civilization, but just the right balance of action, it made for a very entertaining movie. Add to that reference A/V quality and a healthy dose of extras, and The Book of Eli comes highly recommended.

B0042JTDXK|1.0|It is clear that there are plenty of devoted Josh Groban fans posting their glowing reviews here.  I support their right to do so.  At a risk of being pummelled with \\"Thumbs Downs\\" for offering a different take, I'd like to contribute my thoughts.<br /><br />Does he have a lovely voice?  Yes.<br /><br />Having said that...  I don't dig this at all.  If I had to classify it in a genre, I would describe it as American Opera/ Funeral Tunes.  I found it to be wimpy on the highest order.  The CD resulted in a game of \\"Who would win a fistfight?\\" here in my office:<br />Groban-vs-Betty White?  White.<br />Groban-vs-Ghandi?:  Ghandi.<br />Groban-vs Don Knotts?:  Knotts.  (This being the unanimous consensus despite the fact that Knotts is dead.)<br /><br />I offered to 'burn' a copy for some of my colleagues.  They requested that I take the original out behind the building and burn it (literally) instead.
B001EOOQEM|2.0|Black Sabbath are a great band who made some great music, we all know that. But there are the minority who think that Ronnie James Dio isn't really Black Sabbath, and isn't what classic metal is all about. He's too showy for Black Sabbath in my opinion. Ozzy may not not be the brightest singer on the planet, but he's a person. Ronnie is who, what? Besides a 'good voice'? Who wants a good voice, it's the soul that counts. Someone may be able to sing opera, but that doesn't mean they have the 'gift'. John Lennon was the worst singer ever, but he had 'it'. Dio is glam rock, not Black Sabbath. There was something dark and foreboding about Ozzy's dirty, nasal vocals in early Sabbath that is sorely lacking on this record, and on every record without him. The music was more 'real' then as well. You know what I mean. I agree that the musicianship here is quality, Iommi sounds spot on - although this record is a lot more pop/rock than metal. But the music still doesn't touch classic Sabbath. I suppose it's a matter of taste, and there seem to be many, many of you who love this album. I respect that. I read more than once that this is \\"The greatest album ever made, period\\". I believe the first six Sabbath albums to be better than Heaven and Hell, but I think many people just prefer frosting over cake.
B001GCUO5M|1.0|This movie starts out well enough - nice creepy vibe.  Then it becomes very convoluted and just seems to drag on and on.  I won't reveal the ending but I thought it was a cop out.  To me a total waste of 2 hours.
142311339X|5.0|I was at first somewhat skeptical of the return, but the integration of Greek and Roman gods was done seamlessly, and while Jason may have been a bit stiff, it was easy to understand why as his background was revealed.     I can't wait for the next volume.

B003ES5ZPK|4.0|This adapter works well, passing the signals with no apparent degradation.  Be aware it swivels 90* up/down, but only about 60* left/right.  They were perfect for my Sony LED-LCD side ports, which are \\"backwards\\" so a normal right-angle adapter would have pointed forward instead of back.    My only beef is that the adapter is a tad flimsy, a fairly light inadvertent tug on the cable snapped the adapter's case on the male end.
B00130T3LS|4.0|These are stunning performances. They easily rank with the energy of the Emerson set, and also have the warmth of the Takacs reading. I'm glad that at 57 I've come to truly enjoy these works. They talk about a lot of experiences that come with survival, experience and wisdom. I'm always surprised by people that say they enjoyed these works immensely while still at a very young age (e.g. college age). I can't say that I had the background and maturity at 18 years old to really absorb these incredible works by Bartok. I was still too busy, learning, growing up, and unfortunately being too self absorbed to be ready for this material. My hat is off to those who claim that they did have that level of maturity at 17 and 18 years old. Enjoy this recording. It is worth every penny and about a thousand times more.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music is one of the great film musicals of all time. I love this picture and I always have. But I don't love the new 45th anniversary Blu-Ray transfer.    An incredible amount of effort has gone into bringing The Sound of Music to Blu-Ray, and the clarity of the new image struck from the original negative is remarkable. It's wonderful to see such loving attention given to a classic film. But in comparing this transfer to the previous 40th anniversary DVD edition, it's easy to see that something essential about the look of the film has been lost.    The Sound of Music is a film with an expressive, impressionistic, exaggerated color palate. While not in the same league of color exaggeration as Gone With The Wind (for instance), The Sound of Music has backgrounds lit with multi-colored lights to imply moonlight, firelight, etc. The main characters may be lit both hot and cold, with a warm golden glow on one side of their faces, and a cold blue light on the other. These color variations and exaggerations are an essential contributor to the storybook-like atmosphere of the movie, and give the cinematography its rich look.    The new Blu-Ray transfer has made all of the color too even, \\"natural\\" and flat. Instead of looking like a painting or an almost surreal fairy tale come to life, the new transfer has an overly-color-corrected, stripped down look which, in my opinion, is not in keeping with the original intention of the filmmakers.    If you look at the previous 40th anniversary DVD transfer, you can really see what I'm talking about. Scenes glow with golden sunlight or cool moonlight, and there's a stylized look which I remember from seeing the film on the big screen in the 70's. When Maria and Captain Von Trapp dance the Landler in the courtyard, for instance, the hedge behind them is lit with several different colors of light representing moonlight and firelight, and they dance into warm light from the party, or into cool exterior light, etc.    The new Blu-Ray transfer almost eliminates differences in these colors, creating a flat, hyper-realistic appearance which makes the characters seem to be standing on a stage set regardless of whether they're standing outside or inside. There's something about the newly-restricted quality of the colors which makes the film look cheap. I was really disappointed.    Don't get me wrong. The movie's still great. But the technicians in charge of the color correction just didn't \\"get\\" the aesthetic of the film, in my opinion, and went too far in evening-out colors and trying to release the \\"reality\\" of the original negative. Surprisingly, the result makes everything look more fake, as well as less magical.    The previous edition of this film just looked better, richer and more artistic. You may not have been able to see every blade of grass as you can in the new Blu-Ray transfer, but the colors and aesthetic presented by the older edition are, in my opinion, more in keeping with the filmmakers original intention.    It just shows you how much of an art form color correction and film transfer can be.    If you want to see a really fine example of HD film transfer, take a look at the Blu-Ray edition of the 1995 Pride and Prejudice mini-series with Colin Firth. Now, that Blu-Ray transfer ELEVATED the picture. If you want to see the depths to which bad color correction can go, take a look at the old DVD transfer of Babette's Feast, which really ruined the look of the film.
1853286044|5.0|A SIMPLE, CONCISE, TIME SAVING GUIDE FOR CONTRACTS DRAFTSMEN -- WITH ACCOMPANYING CD ROM<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This new publication from The Law Society is aimed squarely at a niche readership; i.e. the practitioner in a general commercial practice - the backbone of the legal profession' says the author - probably a provincial practice, or on a high street, or in London's West End.<br /><br />While not intended as a book on either commercial or contract law, 'Drafting Commercial Agreements' nonetheless aims to steer you, the busy practitioner through and around the most common pitfalls that lurk at the heart of what you do.  Advice and tips aplenty are offered on what should be borne in mind when drafting any commercial contract.  The range of flexible and adaptable precedents contained  in this practical volume are designed to help you draw up agreements quickly and easily - and the accompanying CD ROM facilitates customization of contracts to specific client requirements.<br /><br />Divided logically into three parts, the book examines the basic rules, structure and construction of a commercial contract in Part 1, while Part 2 deals with common commercial clauses, notably those relating to exclusion, limitation and liquidated damages, which the author duly notes, is the most difficult of commercial clauses.  Part  3 comments on a broad range of commercial agreements, from agency to buying and selling businesses, to e-commerce, franchising, leasing, sale of goods, IT and much more...the main areas which a draftsman will encounter in his or her everyday work.<br /><br />A commentary is included for each chapter, although the author is quick to point out that there is `no substitute for consulting a specialist volume on matters of complexity' and adds that the use of precedents, time saving though they are, should be based upon a firm grasp of the underlying principles and law which may one day inform a court having to decide the competing merits of two parties who no longer see eye to eye (if they ever did).'<br /><br />Here at last then, is a book -- guide book, actually -- aimed specifically at draftsmen, all of whom, no matter what the size of the practice, bear the responsibility of getting every aspect of the contract right and are eternally at pains to avoid error.  If this is you, you need this book very definitely for the smaller practice.decide the competing merits of two parties who no longer see eye to eye (if they ever did).'

In 1983, Jennifer Beals touched us all with a character so full of strength and determination that she faces a firing squad of judges who will decide whether she gets into a prestigious dance school, or be left in the dead end jobs of welding and exotic dance.    For those of us who have already been touched by the incredible strength of this movie, the decision to buy came right at the beginning of this review in the lyrics to the title song by Irene Cara. But for those of you who have not shared this experience, and must rely on the long, drawn out, and sometimes pedantic reviews to find some nugget that will leave them intrigued enough to actually watch the film, there is only one thing that can be said.    If you haven't seen it, you're probably the only one you know who hasn't, which means you will be made fun of endlessly until you do.  So, spare yourself the shame and humiliation, and give it a go.  What can you lose?    [[ASIN:B000RZIGSG Flashdance (Special Collector's Edition w/ Bonus CD)]]

B002ZG99A4|1.0|I am glad I didn't buy this movie, it was on my cart though. I have seen it at a friend's house last evening.  Come on, I mean I was not expecting a masterpiece, but I was expecting some teeny plot with a big dose of fun. Well the plot isn't there, and neither is the fun, just meaningless WHIZZBANG from start to finish where I said oh thank God it's over. I even woke up with a hangover.  I think it's the lowest that everybody who is in this movie has ever plunged to, and that goes even for Dolf Lundgren.  Not even worth a rental.Just turn the other way.
B002VECM6S|4.0|The Blind Side tells the story (only slightly sensationalized according to various news stories) of Michael Oher, a homeless teenager taken in by a well-off family who make sure he's fed, clothed, and educated. They help him with his sports at the private school he attends in Tennessee while also giving him the family life he never really had. Despite the obvious racial difference, neither side seems to pay it any mind and neither does the viewer; it's mentioned in a few places, but the very realistically-portrayed characters ignore it because they're helping a boy in need. It's something of a heart-wrenching story, as the recruitment for college football runs afoul of NCAA inspectors who consider the parents' favoritism of Ole Miss to be a violation of recruiting rules as they are considered boosters due to their donations to the university. While this is the climax of the movie, Michael's interview with the NCAA inspector and his reaction to her accusations of impropriety, the movie has already provided a wonderful tale of overcoming one's odds through the generosity of those who have more than enough to give. Those hoping for the typical fare of a football movie with grand choreographed plays to make one cringe will be disappointed, since football is not the point of the movie, just a backdrop in a few scenes and the glue that holds the story together. But this movie could have succeeded without ever showing a scene on the field, since it's a story of what real family values are all about.    The DVD is a fine transfer of the film, which rightfully got a Best Actress Oscar for Sandra Bullock (though Tim McGraw's fantastic portrayal of the father never seems to be mentioned), but there is a dearth of special features. These days, people expect a lot of behind-the-scenes featurettes, especially on a movie with Oscar wins attached, but there are none. Neither are there any feature commentaries. There are five deleted scenes of minimal consequence (that is, one can tell why they were cut since they were hardly necessary), though they fill in gaps for less-perceptive viewers, but nothing else. Viewers can watch it dubbed into French or Spanish, while subtitles for English and those two languages are also available.    It's a great movie, but the DVD is really lacking in the features most buyers seem to look for these days, which is the only reason I gave this one four stars instead of five.

0375826742|5.0|This is my favorite of the three Inheritance books so far, and I was surprised to see so many negative reviews. I was riveted throughout this one, and didn't want it to end. Of course it suffers from the usual 'middle book' issue of not having a purely satisfying conclusion, but otherwise I thought it was brilliant.<br /><br />In particular, I like the way the dynamics of magic within Eragon's world have become more sophisticated. As a student of many occult studies, I feel a lot of the energy dynamics described here are a cut above what is often depicted in fantasy/occult fiction. I also felt the characters have deepened and become more complex. I was surprised to find other reviewers' complaining about some of Eragon's darker characteristics and doubts - to me this is what makes him more human, and more interesting.<br /><br />I also did not object to the increased violence, as I did not feel it was presented in a glorifying way. If anything, the opposite, as both Eragon and his foster-brother/cousin Roran have significant moral doubts about war and their part in it. So to me, the violence was meant to depict the harsh realities of war, rather than glorifying it. I also appreciated the increased sociological sophistication, as Paolini offered more insight into the various subcultures (dwarves, elves, Vardon, etc.) The political and psychological infighting, pressures, and positioning all rang very true to me.<br /><br />So frankly, many of the things that other reviewers seem to have seen as a negative, I saw as a positive, and as a sign of increased sophistication! Maybe Paolini is writing for an adult audience now, as he himself has grown into an adult while writing these books. In any case, I'm looking forward to the final book.
0375507256|5.0|Each new section inundates with you with complex setting, characterization and plot.  It's initially overwhelming, but well worth the slog.  After a few pages, the initially, seemingly random, bits of details, dialect, and occurrences transform into a rich tapestry and it's hard to put the book down.

0307266303|5.0|This is the most exciting book about the outdoors I have read since Jon Krakauer [[ASIN:0385494785 Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster]]. McDougall's description of all the characters are so vivid.  Just the amazing life of the American iconoclast nicknamed Caballo Blanco is worth reading the book.  All the races (those absurd 100 mile + survival exploits) become characters in themselves too.  Just like you did not have to be a rock climber to enjoy \\"Into Thin Air,\\" you don't need to be a runner to enjoy \\"Born to Run.\\"<br /><br />There are a few skeptics who think McDougall's stories are myths.  This is highly unlikely as McDougall has a few chapters that are stuffed with scientific references and quotes from leading scientists, coaches, and anthropologists supporting every facts and theories he advances.  Additionally, I readily found much confirming material from Wikipedia sourced articles, YouTube videos and other sources.<br /><br />McDougall hits on something really interesting: barefoot running.  Modern thickly padded running shoes encourage you to land heavily on your heels.  That is the main source of shock and joints injuries.  Within Chapter 25, McDougall refers to several studies and quotes numerous renown coaches that confirm injury rates have actually increased with the advent of thick modern running shoes.  Instead, thinner shoes (the now trendy Vibram FiveFingers shoes) force you to land lightly on your toes and then roll gently on the ball of your feet.  McDougall indicated that Fred Wilt in his book [[ASIN:0911520465 How They Train: Long Distances]] stated that all marathoners, such as Frank Shorter, all ran landing lightly on their toes.  I have seen Frank run live, and he looks like he glides.  When tested by kinesiologists, McDougall will directly experience how running barefoot imparts less shock on the joints than running with thick shoes .<br /><br />McDougall discloses how Nike went astray by leading the development of thicker and cushier shoes that are comfortable in the store but are really bad for running.  Apparently, Nike management found out early that their design was poor when they sponsored a Stanford running team that will rather run barefoot instead of using their prototype shoes.  Yet, Nike will just spend money on marketing to convince the general public that their thick shoes are the way to go.<br /><br />McDougall's investigation also indicates some people seemed to be wired differently giving them the capacity to run all day.  Some of them happen to be the Tarahumara Indians.  But, an interesting minority are American ultra-marathoners whose exploits are just as mind-boggling as the Indians.  The main difference is that our modern sedentary-high caloric consumption lifestyle makes it more likely to render us obese rather than turn us into ultra-marathoners.  Instead, in societies like the Tarahumaras, the reverse is true.  And, the Tarahumaras are far from alone.  Many other societies in Africa and Asia have similar running talent.  McDougall mentions a running coach, Dr. Joe Vigil, who had studied the practice of many such superior runners worldwide.<br /><br />Chapter 28 is fascinating, when McDougall comes across scientists studying mammals physiology and uncovering that humans were made to be very good long distance runners.  Our upright position, natural long stride, aerobic capacity, neck position, and even sweat glands make us well adapted for endurance running.  This allowed our ancestors to catch exhausted antelopes after a 6 to 10 miles chase.  The latter can run faster but not for long.  It may even be the reason why Homo Erectus survived the more muscular Neanderthal, comparatively a poor long distance runner.  Louis Liebenberg, a mathematician, who spent 4 years living with Bushmen in Africa will write about persistence hunting in [[ASIN:081173627X Practical Tracking: A Guide to Following Footprints and Finding Animals]].<br /><br />McDougall personal journey as a runner is pretty interesting.  He is not made to be a runner (6'4\\" and 230 pounds).  And, he used to have many crippling running injuries.  He visits several specialists who invariably suggest he quits running and start biking instead.  But, he does not give up.  Within chapter 27, he shares how two coaches reeducate his running style to become more efficient, effortless, and injury-free.  He also gets much info about nutrition and becomes vegetarian.  Now, he has more energy and runs longer injury free.  He finally feels like he is \\"born to run\\" too.  Ultimately, he will run and finish a 50 mile race.  It will take him 12 hours or twice as long as the winners.  But, it is still a great personal achievement.<br /><br />\\"The greatest race the world has never seen\\" is the 50 mile race McDougall finished.  It is what it is because it matched the best Tarahumara Indians against some of the very best American ultra-marathoners within the Copper Canyon area.  Ultimately, a Tarahumara Indian will win by just a few minutes over one of the best American ultra-marathoner.

0525423273|5.0|I was lucky enough to read an ARC of this story last month and I can't say enough about it-   Here is the review from my site booknerdbecca (dot) com Shiver was my pick for best book of last year. I am thinking that Anna and the French Kiss is my 2010 pick. This story had everything. Really. There were swoon-worthy moments. Sighing. Beautiful, not-perfect boys. Snarky, smart, sweet girls. Sighs. Stomach drops. Cheering. Yes. I cheered.     I even squeed a little. I'm not ashamed. My husband even mocked me for hugging the book after I wrote my note in it. Yeah, hugged it. That's how good it is. This book had so many great moments and I can't think of anything I would change about it. It had me up and down and that's how I know it was good. It affected my emotions, for better and worse, it had me stuck to it; sneaking reads at my desk and in between teaching, dreaming of what would happen to Anna next, and it was just simply lovely. Stephanie Perkins has a wonderful YA voice, but it's not immature. And thankfully, it's not contrived or condescending. Anna doesn't sound like a grown woman trying to sound like a teen girl. It's just Anna and her friends and her foes and Etienne'.     Ooooooh Etienne'. \\"He has an acute accent and a cute accent.\\" *le sigh*     I HIGHLY encourage my book nerd girls to go get it. I am running out to buy it today. Sadly I couldn't keep the ARC book because it belongs to Forever YA Lit Blogger Jess, but man, I was tempted! I plan on buying a hard back and then a soft cover as well. I recently started speaking to Stephanie via facebook and twitter and she is just as awesome in person as she is in her book. She's an awesome chick, this is a fantastic book, don't walk, run, to your local bookstore and pick up Anna and the French Kiss.     PS- I <3 Etienne'
B000CCIVDO|2.0|Pretty disappointed with these. They sound a little worse than my Panasonic RP-HTX7s, but that's not the worst part. The HPS5000 is *uncomfortable*, these things must be designed for kids, because they sure don't fit my head, a problem I haven't run into with other headphones. The cans need to have a few more degrees of movement for them to fit properly, as it is the tops of the pads pinch the tops of my ears, and the bottom edges don't even come into contact.     Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend these to anyone else without at least test fitting a pair, and even then I'd have reservations because other headphones don't have this kind of fitment issue. Really wish I could return these things.
B0042AEOG0|2.0|I was a little disappointed with this cd.  I LOVED Carey's first Christmas collection.  I look forward to breaking it out every December and it is often on either in the car or during the day in the house.  After listening to this cd, there were few songs that I really liked.  My two favorites are Oh Holy Night and All I Want for Christmas Is You, which are both from her first album.  I just didn't think there were any sing-a-long tunes are this, and even my children seemed rather uninterested in the cd, as evidenced by my two daughters asking me to put on the Christmas station during the playing of this cd.
B00417HV0U|4.0|It's incredible to realize that the corporate heads at the record company did not recognize the potential in this beautiful and very, very good music. It's a damn shame because it undoubtly LCTWWM would've been the triumphant and masterful followup to Jordan: The Comeback itself.   For not being a polished recording, rarely have the Sprouts come close to achieving such an emotional depth over the course of an album.  My beef with the record is Paddy McAloon interjected his current self via vocal overdubs into the old mix (perhaps for cohesiveness and a more finished sounding project, which is understandable). One moment you hear younger Paddy's subtle and boyishly earnest young voice and then a slightly gruff and almost indulgent over-earnestess of his older sounding voice creep in and trying to pass off the vocal take as existing on the same plane in time and space. The effect is like a fresco painter trying to match colors and fill in pieces that have fallen off the wall hoping no one will notice. Of course we notice. The ambiguity between it being packaged and sold as a new recording culled from old recordings is a strategy you wouldn't expect from a band as great as Prefab Sprout.    In other words, perhaps the lesson of this regrettably aborted project could be this: changing the world with music starts when both record companies and artist resist meddling.
B0041QSZJM|1.0|Ho-Ho-Hum!  What happened to China's voice?  She only seems to sing in low registers in this album (like the last one, which got 2 thumbs down from my family, my friends, my book club - where we are all Pink Martini fans).   Did they get a new producer?  No *zing*, the songs sound like they could be sung by my neighbor, or anybody for that matter.  The first 3 albums literally knocked your socks off.  China's voice was magical, the arrangements were outstanding.  I gave those albums for gifts to EVERYONE.  I had two copies of them, and went to their concerts.  Now, I wouldn't cross the street to hear them.  You can barely tell you're playing music.  Sounds like NPR humming.    So slow, not joyful, fun or even interesting.    And truly - I was obnoxiously your biggest fan for the first 3 albums.  Bought China's album without even listening to a track - and was SHOCKED.  It was like a sulking teenage girl whining about being dumped/ignored for the WHOLE album - Cripes!  And so I stupidly once again bought PM's next album, thinking, well, at least it's PM, written, produced by them... nope - what happened with THAT?  That one is in the trash, too.  BUT I had such hopes - how can you screw up a CHRISTMAS album?  Well, I guess we can just ask China Forbes.  I'm on track 8 of my first listening, and I could be asleep at the compluter with the lullabye-type songs, EXCEPT I'm ticked off that I once again fell for the hype.  Could you sing quieter?  No.  Softer?  No. With a teeeny bit of enthusiasm?  I guess not.  Well, not only am I going to contact everyone I recommended your group to and tell them NOT to waster their money, I'm going to put it on Facebook.  I'm really upset, and really, guys, could you do more than a piano trickle and China whispering soft songs?  I loved, loved, loved your energy, enthusiasm, and the uniqueness of your selections.  You USED to rock.
0316098337|4.0|What I liked about this novel: Donoghue's writing style; the protagonist's intelligence, her imagination, coping ability and strength and brilliance at protecting her son under dire circumstances; Jack; humor found on pages 146, 147 and 285; realistic portrayal of the people who weren't able to feel real empathy (including \\"the media\\"); ongoing suspense. What I didn't like: the subject matter itself; not enough pages that made me smile (as 146, 147, 285 did); no epilogue. For some reason, Frankl's, \\"Man's Search For Meaning,\\" popped into my head as I was contemplating this review. I imagine Donoghue read and maybe even drew on Frankl's book while writing \\"Room.\\"
B003HARV3Y|1.0|I was so excited to see this movie, then I saw it! :(     I read Percy Jackson and the Olympians series that Rick Rodian released and LOVED them. I actually got the series of books when the movie was released in theaters and made myself read them before I saw the movie because lets face it a movie that is based on a book always leaves out vital information. This movie left out everything!     I would like to know were they got the whole pearl idea? When did the mom play such a big part? Luke wasn't defeated at the end of this book. Annabeth was blonde, a book worm, and fought with a dagger. There was no Clarisse from the Ares cabin! There was NO Ares either! Half blood camp was described differently and Poseidon didn't build Percy a cabin. No one knew Percy was Poseidons kid until Poseidon claimed him. Hades never formed out of a fire at camp half blood. The book had an oracle that gave a Great Prophecy. Oh I could go on forever on all the things that the book had and the movie didn't but I think this is already long winded.    I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone that has read the books. I think that you would be left wondering what the heck you just saw. I had to even make sure it was the correct movie that I put into the dvd player. A HUGE TWO THUMBS DOWN!!!!  Sorry Rick Rodian the movie was a let down but the books were great.
0061537969|5.0|This is in the running for my favorite book of all time.  I'm a dog lover, but could care less about racing.  However, Stein makes such insightful connections between life and racing that it resonated with me.  The narrator Enzo, the dog, has more personality and wit than most people I know.  There is not one thing I would say negative about this book except perhaps that my future book selections have big shoes to fill.....

B003TT2X72|1.0|The skinny is this should be subtitled as \\"Theatrical Edition\\" (179 Min), but it's not. Since blu-ray tech came well after the release of the DVD special extended edition release (223 Min), one would think Peter Jackson would only re-release the superior special extended version in the stead of the theatrical edition? Bottom line, he didn't. So why would Mr. Jackson make this release of the shorter version instead? Well to fool those consumers who would think that the blu-ray would naturally have the extended version. Thus those foolish costumers (my hand risen, as one of them) will end up buying both versions, Theatrical and the more aparently impending to be later re-released Special Extended, separately on blu-ray... pretty ef'ed up, but true. LOTR Fan consumers beware!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My daughter is 10 and an avid reader. Once she started reading this series she could not put it down. I would have to tell her to stop reading at night in order to get her to go to bed. I would highly recommend this for your child.

B0036TGSJ4|5.0|Easy A is about Olive, an average high-school girl who, to get out of a camping trip with her best friend, decides to make up a lie that she's going out with a college guy that weekend.  After the rumor spins out of control as the school's Christian mean girl gets a hold of it, she tells everyone!  Olive decides to use the rumor as an advantage as people pay her to say that she slept with them.    Easy A is a fantastic movie.  It's a comedy-drama that's a mix of the witty dialogue of Juno (You'll be quoting the movie after you're done) with the theme of popularity from Mean Girls along with the Christianity of Saved!  The character's are extremely likable.  Emma Stone and Amanda Bynes are probably the best characters in this movie along with Olive's parents.  The plot deals greatly on today's issues of sexuality and the pressure's of having sex before you're ready.  The ending felt rushed but, the rest of the movie was so well done, it didn't have an effect on the rating.  I give this movie an Easy five stars!      The special features included on the DVD and Bluray seem like a great extra for the lovers of this movie.
B003TXSF5C|1.0|Overly wordy and without substance on the stated subject.  Read the three superb books by  Eric Chaisson for depth and insight into the current state of cosmology, energy and the possible evolution of life.
B002ZG974M|5.0|This is a very enjoyable and informative documentary.  I was interested by the role of the fathers in the different cultures.  In Nambia you never see an adult male, much less the father.  In Mongolia the only time you see the father is when he puts his wife and new baby on the motorcycle to take them home.  (You don't see much of the mother of this baby either and he is left on his own alot apparently.  He gets in to trouble and pitches a fit of frustration at one point and no one pays attention.)  The Japanese father is somewhat involved, but not really.  He swings a toy to calm the baby while he's on the phone.  The San Francisco father is heavily involved in all aspects of the baby's life.

031603438X|4.0|I had more trouble assigning this a numerical score than I have had with any of the more than 125+ reviews that I have written for Amazon in the last 10 years or so.  It could have been anywhere between 1 and 5 stars, I suppose, depending on the criteria used for scoring.  It was loads of fun to read, and contained lots of information that I, as a more than a 40+ year fan of the Rolling Stones and a guitar player myself, found fascinating, informative and interesting.  At the same time, as also an inveterate reader of biographies, particularly musical biographies, Life was frustrating and incomplete.<br /><br />Yes, I realize that this was an autobiography, and as such, was also a sort of an egobiography, and therefore cannot be rated in the same way as a \\"normal\\" biography.  There are many fascinating passages, and there is no doubt that as a (semi)chronological record of how Keith Richards remembers the past 50 years, it is a tour-de force description of the ontogenesis of one of the most interesting and influential figures of pop culture of the last half-century.  But let's be clear about one thing.  This is a Keith auto/egobiography.  Those looking for a detailed dissection of the internal dynamics and history of the Rolling Stones are advised to look elsewhere.<br /><br />The writing is more than serviceable.  Frankly, I was a bit surprised at how well it read.  And there are several quotes from many of Keith's buddies and partners in crime. Interestingly however, and in keeping with the overall tone of the autobiography, most of the quotes are NOT from other members of the Rolling Stones, but from others close to Keith including Bobby Keys, Keith's first son, Marlon (named, it would seem after Brando), girlfriends and a number of his non-Rolling Stone bandmates.<br /><br />There was enough semi-technical guitar lore (e.g., the genesis of his penchant for open G-tuning with a 5-string guitar from which the low E string had been removed and which has been the bane of many guitarists like myself that could never duplicate the sound of tunes like Honky-Tonk Women or Brown Sugar exactly right) to keep musicians satisfied without overloading non-musicians, as well as a number of examples of how many of the Jagger-Richards tunes were composed.<br /><br />But at the center of everything is Keith, always Keith.  Jagger comes off as a not very well-endowed and insecure would-be tyrant who played a mean harmonica and liked to practice vocal scales before shows. Very, very little space is accorded to Mick Taylor (perhaps understandable since he had such a short, albeit incredibly important and musically rich stint as the Stones lead guitarist), but also to Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, or Ron Wood.  The number of words devoted to each aside, it surprised me somewhat to see that, at least from my reading, Keith seemed to have the most respect (or at least fewest backhanded compliments or outright criticisms) for Mick Taylor and Charlie Watts.  He loves Charlie as a drummer!! Still, one has to take everything that was written with a grain of salt since it was so clearly so very, very Keith-o-centric.<br /><br />As an autobiography, \\"Life\\" suffers somewhat from a somewhat overlapping and confused chronology.  Although it is written more or less linearly, there is a substantial amount of overlap and recapping between the chronologically segmented chapters.  And despite the great length of the book (550+ pages), I felt that there were a number of large, unexplained holes.  Ian Stewart, praised by Keith as and integral member and the heart and soul of the Stones, sort of disappears from the narrative long before he stopped playing with the band. No explanation is given and he only reappears when he dies, despite the fact that he was incredibly integral to Keith's playing and the sound of the Stones from the early days through the time of Brian Jones' death and the addition of Mick Taylor - a period that included some awesome music and pianoplaying.<br /><br />Talk about your bad boys of rock and roll!!  Although I am no stranger to the drink or the smoke (or a bit more), I was shocked and awed by the incredible, over-the-top drug and drink-infused atmosphere in which Keith raised (I use the term loosely) his son, Marlon.  Marlon appears to have been raised mostly on the road, touring with Keith, with no education in an atmosphere of drugs, guns and money that would have twisted the strongest and most brilliant of minds.  Perhaps Keith simply left out all the \\"normal', family-like child-rearing portions of this kid's life but somehow I don't think so.  Marlon appears to have had one of the most horrific and surrealistic childhoods ever documented.  Regardless, however, when he did end up in school, he claims to have finished with 4 \\"A\\" levels - the American equivalent of finishing High School with a 4.0 average.<br /><br />As is often the case with musical autobiographies (or other biographies, musical or otherwise), this one was extremely skewed towards the early salad days of Keith and the Stones.  About two-thirds of the book details events through the early 1970's, with the rest compressing the remaining 30 years into 150 pages or so.<br /><br />This is the longest review I have ever written for Amazon.  But there was a lot to cover.  As I said at the outset, your own rating will likely depend on what you are looking for.  If you are looking for an unbiased biography of one highly influential rock and roller's life, or the history of the Rolling Stones, then I'm afraid this is not it.  But it you are a Keith fan, and are looking for insight into who and what this guy is about, then this one's for you.<br /><br />JMTrock and roll!!

B0013XS8A2|5.0|The term 'Music of the Spheres' or 'Musica Universalis' is used to describe the perfect harmony of 'sounds' that the universe and its bodies make. It has long been used as a term to describe something which is in perfect harmony.    Mike Oldfield's Music of the Spheres is everything the term implies. It is a perfect harmony of music, combining the talent of the genius with his work and the work of other classical music to create this album.    I would describe Music of the Spheres as a classical version of Tubular Bells, because it truly is in the Classical music genre. Modern Classical might be the best way to describe it.    Think of a Tubular Bells version written by Mozart or Bach, with modern technology and mathematically perfect, and you get Mike Oldfield's Music of the Spheres. It leaves you thinking: \\"Wow!\\"
B002H3EUAE|4.0|I love the extra stuff packed inside of the awesome tin! The movie however, seems to be the same quality as the DVD. You would think they would have spent some time cleaning up the movie for it's Blu-ray release. This is one of my favorite movies of all time so it was still worth the purchase.
B000IOM1YG|5.0|There is little to add to all the great and detailed reviews of this album. It is very good, that is all that there is to it.    I just want to comment that unless a very devout APP fan, most of the extra tracks are good to listen to once, but get a little old after a few times. They are not at all bad, they are just versions that APP ended up modifying to release in the original album.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|My roommate and I randomly decided to give this show a chance and we loved it!  We are both female, by the way.  Those who think this is a man's show are sorely mistaken.  Except for the first couple of episodes - they're a bit rough - I absolutely LOVE this show.  I don't recommend it to those who are easily offended by adult language, nudity, and graphic sexuality.  That might be a deterrent for most people, but I found it entertaining and realistic.
B003M98792|4.0|I own an original US 1-sheet poster and it claims the American re-edit Shogun Assassin was released in Dolby Stereo, same goes for the Spanish release.   Does anyone know why this US (and UK) 30th aniversary blu ray is in mono only?    The picture transfer is the best Shogun has looked outside of a 35mm print. The UK blu ray is one better, being a beautiful steelbook with the US poster repro on the back. The UK censor ratings are also printed on the removable card, thus avoiding ruining the overall design of the UK steelbook.

B003L77G2Y|5.0|Serial television is my favorite format, but Fringe has all the other fun things, too -- science, medicine, parallel universes, autopsies, giant intestinal worms -- plus the personal tension among the characters, the brilliant actors and scripts. If the 'verse is willing, it won't peter-out like X-Files, or disappear due to low TV ratings like Max Headroom or Serenity. Having a whole new season to watch at your own pace, w/o having to wait each week for a particular night & time, is the best. There should be some form of ratings credit for that kind of fan. Maybe pre-purchases are counted...?    [[ASIN:B003L77G2Y Fringe: The Complete Third Season].
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I am using an 20\\" AOC monitor with this mount, and it is great.  It easily adjusts into almost any position.  Moving from landscape to portrait is effortless and a great way to work on word documents.  I purchased this for my classroom and allows me to quickly and easily swivel the monitor so the students can view power points or other images.  The cord keepers are okay, but I'm not sure what would work better.  I just added some zip-ties.

B002T9H2MO|5.0|Obviously this was a low budget movie, but it the plot is anything but cheap. The characters, there's only one human character (or is there?) and then the computer that is our hero's sole companion are done very well. There is a lot of emotion in the story.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|If you own the original single disc I'd advise you to pass it along and order the new release.

B002MW50KO|2.0|The old folk singer arrived at the Army station on the forward front that frosty Christmas Eve. He wasn't Bing Crosby with a voice that graveled and sputtered like the battered Army truck he came in with those buoyant USO girls and the band. It didn't matter. Those boys couldn't get a pass to the town that night, not when partisans were still at large and everyone knew the Soviets would take advantage of the chaos if they could.    The letters came with them and Christmas cards from schoolchildren in Minneapolis. And the singer gave them-their own memories. So maybe afterward nobody remembered the singer, or the pathetic band-they were thinking of home and those they couldn't be holding and kissing and sitting by the stove with that night. Comfort and joy. And tears. Hope, too, because the war was over and soon they'd be home and every man swore he'd never leave home again as long as he lived, and most of them never did-not counting the ones who were laughing and dancing, because a heart of stone won't weigh a man down like love does.
0374158460|5.0|The Corrections was one of my favorite books of the last decade and I wasn't sure if Franzen could do it again. I was not disappointed. Like The Corrections, he writes a tale of a modern, middle-class family, yet Freedom delves deeper into the struggles to be good citizens, good parents and the nuances of long term partnership. Descriptions of daily life are fast paced and vivid enough to keep you engrossed. His technique of telling the story from different personal and generational experiences forms a detailed world you won't want to leave.   I was wary of the hype surrounding this book, especially since he allowed it to be placed in Oprah's Book Club this time around (he protested the choice of The Corrections a few years ago). Also, the arguments that arose about praise for male vs. female writers. Was literary advertising behind this? Was it all a bunch of noise to sell a book that wasn't very good? All of which proved to be good press for a quality read.
0143116738|3.0|This is an excellent 2009 book by Sir Ken Robinson on creativity, multiple intelligences and finding your passion which he defines as \\"the element\\". The element or our human potential is \\"where the things you love to do and the things you are good at come together (p.8). Based on numerous interviews conducted by Robinson and his co-author Lou Aronica, this book is both a collection of success stories of people who dropped out of the education system and made good, and a subtle critique of the inflexibility and ineffectiveness of the education system. However, the authors did not specific which education system as they drew examples from both side of the Pacific. They seem to be aiming at a generic education system. (see Sir Robinson's lecture in TEDS).<br /><br />Similar in essence to Outliers: The Story of Success (2008) by Malcolm Gladwell, the authors however argue that a passion for success is a combination of being in the element; doing what you like to do in the area you are talented in. While this true in the people they have selected for interviews (usually those who were miserable in school and those who dropped out), there are however two other groups of people which was ignored in the book. The first other group is school dropouts who did not succeed as spectacularly as those mentioned. The implication is that they did not succeed because they did not find their elements. The second group is that those people who stuck through school, graduate, get a higher education and are now pillars of society (clerks, lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc). The implication is that these people have not found their elements and are now unhappy in their lives.<br /><br />While I agree some of the principles of many of the things the authors espoused, I believed their arguments are too generalised and giving it a label (the Element) does not make it better. Like Gladwell did in Outliers, these specially chosen interview subjects are chosen specially to provide their theories. However, what was obvious from the people interviewed in both books are their determination and perseverance to achieve their dreams no matter the cost. The lesson I draw from them is the indomitable power of the human spirit.as obvious from the people interviewed in both books are their determination and perseverance to achieve their dreams no matter the cost.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I am a huge fan of this show but have so far hesitated to collect the seasons on DVD or Bluray because of their INSANE prices. I do not typically go above $20 for a TV season, and to find this season on DVD on Black Friday for only $12 just about made my day! I can always count on Amazon for surprising me (and my wallet) - and I am sure to be a loyal customer for a long time.
B004B4RCDE|4.0|I don't understand why people are downing this album so much. I think this album is better vocally compared to \\"Rated R\\". The material on this album is a culmination of all of her previous albums, and I think it's great.<br /><br />I think there is a lot of great variety and themes on this album. I love the sexiness of \\"What's My Name?\\", the majestic ballad \\"California King Bed\\", and the way Barbadian \\"Man Down\\".<br /><br />The lyrics of all these songs may not be as personal or introspective as \\"Rated R\\", but Rihanna still owns each lyric effortlessly. Her voice is so recognizable compared to so many other artists, even if you auto-tuned it like in \\"Raining Men\\".<br /><br />That's what I've always liked about her is that her voice is so unique and strong. This album really shows her vocal strength especially in \\"Only Girl\\", \\"Complicated\\" and \\"California King Bed\\". I'm really impressed with the way she pushed her range to the limit.<br /><br />I recommend this to Rihanna fans for sure, they won't be disappointed. But if you were looking for hard-edged \\"Rated R\\" Rihanna, you will find less of it on this album. You can tell by the flowery album artwork and the fluffiness of the some songs on this album that her record label wanted to show the softer side of Rihanna, especially given what's happened her in the past. And that's alright with me as long as Rihanna is happy and having control of her life.
031603438X|4.0|As a music fan who is very aware of the legend that is Keith Richards, I ordered this book with great anticipation.  The book starts off with an explosive short story that is worth the price of the book all by itself.  You are thrown into a short story about Keith Richards and a classic yet unbelievable run in with the local police in the South while on a tour in America.  I am left with a smile on my face as I am hooked on the colorful character I am being introduced to.  After that, each additional page is pure dividends.  I am given a more detailed picture about a man I thought I once knew but only turns out were distant acquaintances.  It is truly a wonderful story of hardship and eventual success.

Everything it covers is completely obvious, yet totally out of reach when you're faced with a senior management team that suddenly decides it is time to 'innovate'.

0743435753|2.0|Nothing interesting happens until chapter nine... 100 pages of slowness.<br /><br />This book exaggerates the problems and heart of the Honor Harrington series.  Like [[ASIN:0743435710 On Basilisk Station (Honor Harrington)]], the last three chapters (about 50 pages total) have an awesome space battle.  It's from chapter 30 onward, and it's the best part of the novel.  Like [[ASIN:0743435729 The Honor of the Queen (Honor Harrington #2)]] the setting takes place in the Yeltsin system, and the first 375 pages contain hateful misogyny involving the Grayson variant of Catholic religion.  It's 'let's hate girls' straight from the trashbin of Honor book two.  Like [[ASIN:0743435737 The Short Victorious War (Honor Harrington #3)]] fifty pages superficially cover the political situation in the People's Republic, following a totalitarian coup, and ultimately add little to the book except inflating the page count.  Like [[ASIN:0743435745 Field of Dishonor (Honor Harrington #4)]] a tragedy puts Honor Harrington offline for about five chapters, and the angst was annoying and overwritten.<br /><br />I hated fifteen chapters, disliked seven, thought six were 'Ok', liked four, and loved the one where Clausewitz was mentioned. Using a chapter-based average, that means I rate the book at 2 stars.  While I did enjoy small parts of the 442 page novel, my overall impression was a good editor should have disciplined the book to 300 pages and cut the irrelevancies and purple prose.  I read Weber for space opera military battles, not for political science, definitely NOT for religious dogma, and not for tragic mysteries.  This book had very little space opera (only about 1/6 of the content), which is why I didn't like the whole.<br /><br />If book six shares the long passages of irrelevant 'told' exposition and (minor) character introspection, that may be it for me with this series.  I simply didn't enjoy wading through so much junk to hit the highlights.
3836522845|5.0|he Book is amazing, came to my place in perfect shape, and a little earlier than it was schedual. Im very happy with this buy.
0061245097|5.0|I was anxious to start this book due to the cliff-hanging and sad ending (in my opinion) of the first book. I began the NH series in London and only brought the first book with me as I wasn't sure I would have time to read or like it as I was just finishing up the Midnight Breed series novels by Lara Adrian. Boy was I pissed at myself for not bringing the second one along. I finished the first book a few days into my two-week trip and had to substitute this second book for the other PNR book I brought along...Dark Hunter #1 by Sherrilyn Kenyon, and let me say this, it was a poor, poor substitute and time filler. Of course I read it and finished it, but I was upset I couldn't have the next three NH series to read until I got back this Saturday, October 30. On Halloween Day I went out to buy the last two of the NH series so I could have them at my disposal when I finished the second one. And on Sunday, that is what I did. I finished the second book of the series and finished the third and fourth two days later. Three books in three days, I guess you could say I enjoy Frost's series.    Anyway, to my review. This second book picks up again with Cat Crawfield, half-vampire, half-human hybrid who is now a Special Agent for the FBI's paranormal division. We learn many exciting new things in this book, get introduced and acclimated with new characters such as Tate, Dave, Cooper, and the re-appearance of supernaturals from Bones' past and present.    This story does not disappoint and was a great follow-up to the first NH novel. I was upset by Cat and Bones' break-up in the first book and was extremely excited to see that remedied in this novel. Call me a sucker, but I enjoy a happy ending. Although the relationship is not easy, nor does it get any easier throughout the series, Cat and Bones are ever strong, fierce, and deeply in love, and that is the reason I believe this series works so well and has so many fans.    This book tells the story (or expands on it) how Bones is connected with Ian and Spade. Frost includes again how the three \\"men\\" are connected and there is the introduction of Mencheres, a prominent figure of the vampire community and in the next novels of the NH series.    Again, I enjoyed how kick-ass and fast-paced Frost's writing is. Just when things seem to be dying down, and as much as I'd like to see Bones and Cat get some down-time, the story picks up with another phone call or door knock that has trouble on the other end. If you enjoyed the first of the series, you will enjoy the second. Hook, line, and sink...or bite, whichever you prefer.
B003L20ICO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this film. The script of course is a good starting point, while I've noticed that some of the reviews have thus far been a bit nasty (mostly by angry lesbians or angry religionists) the script was really spot on in portraying the complications of human sexuality and the relationships that results of these complications. Making none of the characters truly unlikeable is one of the most important achievements that a writer can aspire to. Similarly the actors that take the material and make it their own breathe a unique life into this film. What could have been a disaster with the wrong casting turns out sublime with every actor, young and old, delving into the richness that this script provides. Lastly would be directing and production. While on a film like this they are less important then the other two aspects these pieces don't distract from the film, instead really focusing on the relationships that all the characters have with each other. For all the gripes about the end, it is realistic and completely believable.
0385473788|5.0|I ordered this for my grand-daughter. She had been reading the story of Anne Frank at school and wanted<br />one for her library. A wonderful, yet emotional book for the young teenager to read and relate to another teens diary, her life, her feelings,the unforgettable events and time her diary was written.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|It's what you would expect from Disney these days.  It's a little too graphic for young children and they may not catch what is actually going on.  I viewed this with my children and they could not sleep at night.  Really removes the joy of Christmas. NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN!!!!
B0042J6VUS|5.0|Was actually skeptical to buy this thing because it's so cheap compared to other iphone tripod mounts, but it is perfect. Works great, feels pretty durable. Comes with its own little tripod, or you can pull it off and throw it on your own tripod. So far it seems great...no need to pay more..
B003EYVXXW|4.0|I like well made movies that take me to an historical time and place of which, I not only never researched, but never really even thought about. Agora is such a movie. I've known about the burning of the Library at Alexandria, but I never considered the events surrounding it. I also never thought about the rise of Christianity once it was no longer under persecution by the Romans.    Hypatia (the Rachel Weisz character) was a real historical figure. She taught philosophy, mathematics and astronomy, and tried to figure out the movements of the heavenly bodies. This was happening at a time when the Christians were gaining in their numbers. The differences between the Pagan, Christian and Jewish religions heat up to boiling point. This causes rifts in Hypatia's class, as well as local society in general, to the point where large numbers of people die violent deaths.    I don't know how much historical accuracy suffers for the need of a good script here, but it's fascinating to see it all unravel. The prime characters become a cross section of society in general and it's not pretty to watch. Christian viewers beware. This paints Christians of that time as a violent, ugly people. Some of them even wear pouches filled with rocks in case they need to stone someone at a moment's notice. They are shown as having no tolerance. If you are not a Christian, your life is forfeit.     This film is good on the eyes. The sets and costumes are great to look at. The performances are very good as well. If there is anything I thought could have been better it's that certain ideas the writer/ director was trying to convey could have been a bit more subtle. A particular scene when, in the craziness of the events, Hypatia's slave comes to see her and begins with his attempting to rape her and ends with his crying on her as though she were his mother was a bit \\"too.\\" But this is a minor quibble. This is a rich movie with a great revealing of what was happening in this time and place. If you're at all a fan of historical epics, this should well be worth your time.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|I'm not qualified to write a music review. This is an opinion piece.    I was nervous about this album. Josh kept saying how different it was, how \\"stripped down,\\" how personal. Stripped down and personal sounded perfect, as long as the voice was still there.     The first taste he gave us was \\"Hidden Away.\\" It left me underwhelmed. Then he gave us a clip of the creation of \\"Voce existe em mim.\\" I was left mesmerized and aching for more.    And finally, the whole album. On first listening, I was somewhat unimpressed and disappointed. But it's Josh, so I played it again. Then again. And dang it, now I can't stop listening. It's a drug, and I'm addicted. Finally, we have it. Josh's voice; Josh's music; Josh's heart.    This is the way I see it: David Foster gave Josh his first two-wheeled bike, and showed him how to ride it. But David never took the training wheels off, and he never took his hand off the seat.    Rick Rubin threw the training wheels away, gave Josh a shove, and said, \\"Go ride your bike.\\"    Like all the rest of us, Josh wrecked a few times. Rode off into the bushes once or twice, maybe even ran off the road into a ditch. Scratched and bruised, he kept getting back on.    I, too, wish he'd abandon the falsetto; I find it unnecessary and distracting. Josh, we love your BARITONE. One of my favorite things about this album is that it does take him back to the basement - or at least the ground floor - where we all fell in love with him in the first place. He still visits the \\"mad heights,\\" where he sometimes loses his balance, more than I wish he would.    I didn't care for \\"Straight to You.\\" I hated \\"They Won't Go When I Go\\" (available only on-line for those who bought the \\"special Internet-only fan edition\\"). But, the more I listen, the more I hear, and they're both growing on me - like fungus. And in \\"They Won't Go,\\" Josh tumbles all the. Way. Down. To his bottom range.     Strangely, in the first few hearings, I didn't really hear Josh's voice - just afrail imitation. I don't know why; now it's absolutely there, in all (well, maybe almost all) its glory.    My most serious criticism is the similarity of several of the songs: \\"Bells,\\" \\"If I Walk Away,\\" \\"Higher Window,\\" and \\"Love Only Knows.\\" Oddly my favorites on the album, still they sound so similar that the intros don't tell me which song is playing.     This won't be my favorite Josh album. I love it for what he tried. I don't like it for what it ended up being: Less about his voice, more about his song-writing. And Josh, I love you dearly, but dear boy - you're no Paul Simon. But this is new, it's fresh, and it's beautiful. For a while, it slakes the thirst.    Keep practicing, Josh. In no time, you'll be handling that bike like a master.
B0044XV3QY|2.0|On my Vizeo Blu-Ray player, this movie looks great and I like the movie.  My complaint is that it skips at specific points throughout the movie.  The entire scene of Dr. Augustine's school and the analysis of the tree roots is jumped over, as two other places as well including a very large portion at the end of the movie.  It seems to get confused when transitioning between chapters.  I have to rewind it to see the parts.  Remarkably, it doesn't jump if I am fast forwarding.    So I ordered another.  And it skipped AGAIN!  And in the exact same spot!; immediately after the first jungle scene where Dr. Augustine says, \\"Prolemuris, they're non-agressive.  Relax marine, you're making me nervous\\".  It jumps forward to Jake Sully walking toward the spiral flowers.    Anybody have the same issue?      This is obviously a blu-ray construction issue, as it makes no sense for my Blu-ray player, which is brand new by the way, to jump so specifically.  It's very irritating.    My rating for this item is based solely on the item, and does not reflect the movie at all, which is a great movie.
B001FB5634|4.0|I'm not sure what I expected from this movie but it surprised me. Not sure if it was in a good way. So many of these end of the world movies focus on groups of people joining together, people starting over & things eventually getting better. This one does not. Which I guess is the more realistic way to look at how it may actually be. The 2 main characters are a father & his son. The son was born during the aftermath. This brings a boy who doesn't know what the world used to be like, at one point you see him staring in awe at a deer head mounted on a wall and you realize he has never seen one before. He's never played with or even seen other children. His father is determined they will survive. You realize how hopeless things are when you see the age of the boy & know they have been living like this all of these years. On top of trying to find food, always traveling from place to place, they must avoid people who have turned to cannibalism. You can't trust anyone. After awhile, you start to realize that maybe the apocalypse wouldn't be quite what other movies have made it out to be. It's actually very lonely, very scary & very depressing. The ending for me was sort of sudden. I'm not saying I didn't like the outcome it just seemed as though it was too easy. The acting was wonderful & while it may have been depressing to imagine what it could actually be like, I couldn't stop watching. Just make sure you are in the right mind frame first. This is one of those movies you will find yourself thinking of on occasion for days to come afterward.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|Last December, I heard a music review on National Public Radio, of a new Christmas album by Sting, called \\"If On a Winter's Night...\\" . (Yes, the ellipsis is part of the title.) The reviewer played clips of some of the songs, and talked about a few of the tracks, enough to make me want to buy the CD. So I did.    I think I played it once last winter, and not even all the way through. It sat on my shelf until July, when I decided to listen to it again. It's much more listenable the second (and third) time around.    If you're in the mood for Nat King Cole's \\"The Christmas Song\\" or John Denver and the Muppets' \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas,\\" this album just won't do it for you. It's a very introspective album. Each song invites the listener to go with Sting, deep into the emotions and the thoughts that are the underpinnings of The True Meaning of Christmas.    There's no catchy \\"Winter Wonderland\\" in this album, and no Beach Boys harmonies. Even Natalie Cole's beautiful rendition of \\"Mary, Did You Know\\" doesn't dig as deep as the lyrics on this album, and Natalie's \\"Mary\\" does dig deep. Each song on this album takes one emotion, and examines it in the light of the season, to a depth (sometimes a surprisingly dark depth) that may make the casual listener uncomfortable.    But don't listen to the album casually. Allow yourself the luxury of really getting into it. And take time to read the accompanying booklet.    The music, both the composition and performance, are superb. Because it isn't tied to the rhythms of the traditional carols like \\"Silent Night\\", or the contemporary jingles like \\"Winter Wonderland\\", the music is as deeply introspective as the lyrics, and the music matches the lyrics in magical ways. Besides that, Sting takes advantage of the opportunity to showcase his musical talent, to do some virtuoso things that you won't hear on commercial radio.    It may be too deep, too dark, for you. Borrow it or sample it before you decide to buy. Don't plan on playing it at a Christmas party. It's not that kind of music. It will kill the party in a hurry. But on a winter's night, when you're home alone or with the one person in the world who understands you, put it on and allow Sting to pull you in to a different kind of Christmas experience.
B0042UEU8M|5.0|Everything Zach does is touching. I really don't know why that is but I guess some people were just born with \\"it.\\"     This movie was simply amazing! A compelling film which  pulled at your heart strings! Zac's performance in this movie was A+ as usual. And the storyline ran as smooth as can be. It was a little predictable but in a good way. I definitely recommend this movie but don't forget your tissues because I cried a bit. :)
B002ZG980U|5.0|I have always been amazed about the human ability to dream. I have always wonder if anyone could truly capture that topic. And I believe Inception did a wonderful job of making the dream world a reality, at least as far as movies go. It is one movie that kept me on the edge of my seat, with mouth wide open wondering what was going to happen next. And at the end, everyone is still left wondering. That is the mark of a good movie when everyone still must speak about it after it is over. It's movie that must be seen more than...three times...while more than ten to gather every germ it has to offer. Great movie!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I thought I had high quality Sony earbuds already, but when I decided to get headphone, I was blown away at what I have been missing. I'm not an audiophile, but I did hear beats and sounds that I never heard from my earbuds before. Super impressed.<br /><br />I used it on my ipod and laptop and both work extremely well. This is staying home though since it's way too big and the line is too long and bulky to carry outside.  It also has some pretty strong outside noise cancellation, so it's not too safe to use on the streets or subway.
0937381888|5.0|This book can turn a novice \\"kit\\" brewer into a pro in a matter of weeks.  From the basics to the in depth process of how sugars are formed during saccharification, Palmer handles it all.  An invaluable resource that has earned a place on my brewing bookshelf indefinitely.    I enjoy most how he leads the reader into topics before diving head first into them.  Tired of the details?  Palmer suggests skipping ahead a few chapters, quoting that \\"...you will make beer.\\"  As a stand-alone tome of brewing, or a jump start and push in the right direction, Palmer's book will suffice.
B001HN69B8|4.0|I've always liked Terry Gilliam films. They usually require 2-3 viewings before everything makes sense, and even before you understand it you get drawn into the characters and sets. Lilly Cole is enchanting as the love interest and using three different actors (Johnny Depp, Jude Law, & Heath Ledger) playing the same character really threw me at the beginning. But I loved it.<br /><br />If you like movies that don't follow the normal Hollywood formula, you'll love this film. And on Blu-ray it looks and sounds even better.
B001DSNF8C|4.0|CASINO ROYAL (new version) was a in my opinion a far from the standard James Bond picture and not particularly good.  The original was a campy comedy, outdated for today standards, but this one borders with a tragedy.<br />BLU-RAY quality is the best thing for this picture. Images are crisp and clear; sound outstanding. You can almost feel in those exotic places excluded Miami which is a fake. I still cannot understand why not even the exterior of the real Miami Airport was used.<br /><br />Obviously CASINO ROYALE was made for the new USA generation where fantasy does not exist; sex is bad, killing is good and drinking is in between.  This James Bond is a tortured fiend, more resembling Jason Bourne than the character portrait by Sean Connery.<br /><br />If you are interested in good filmed action, PG-13 violence and exotic (albeit not 100% real ) locations this  is your movie.  If you are looking for fun look elsewhere
0316067938|5.0|This book was the best!! It was so detailed and me and my friends loved it! Thank you Stephanie Meyers!!!
0684823454|5.0|An excellent adventures book, but also a psicological tale of a growing soul: Churchill is able to dissect himself in every chapter, and show it as it was, without disguise. You can see the poor, terrified children that looks for his father and also the man that was going to save the world  It is not a model for structure (lineal), while style just pretends to be readable. Churchill is more a teller than a writer, but what a teller.  A nicely written book that deserved at least half of the Novel prize he won.
B00428ZRFY|5.0|THE BEST TRACKS HANDS DOWN ARE ONLY GIRL (IN THE WORLD), WHAT'S MY NAME (MY FAVE), S&M, RAINING MEN, SKIN AND LOVE THE WAY YOU LIE PART 2.... GREAT CD THAT I COULD LISTEN TO FROM BEGINNING TO END AND I LOVE THE BONUS DVD! NOT HER BEST ALBUM BUT A SOLID EFFORT! NICE TO SEE HER BACK TO HER ROOTS AND HAPPY AND CAREFREE AGAIN.... CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT SHE'S GONNA RELEASE AS SINGLES AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HER NEXT ALBUM AND TOUR!
B002GJU54E|5.0|I have read all of the Stephanie Plum series, but this book really tickled the ole funny bone.  I laughed, chortled and guffawed my way through each page of this book.  This is by far my favorite Janet Evanovich novel to date.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|A well written story and the picture quality was amazing in 1080p format. Only disappointment was that this particular Blu-ray title does not come with a high definition sound track. It only has the core Dolby Digital soundtrack, which still sounds excellent.
B002ZG999U|4.0|An over the top action film that delivers for those who like this particular genre.  An impressive list of actors portray various mercenary roles (as well as others who are connected to them) who are set on freeing an island nation from the nefarious claims of an American industrialist and his puppet dictator.  This is good fun with some funny lines but also some cheesy ones.  If you don't like the new direction of action films this isn't for you because there are a lot of tongue in cheek moments where you can tell various actors and behind the scenes types were having their fun.  Old School soundtrack.  Surprise appearance included.<br /><br />CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOT POINTS: B minus; GETTING SUCH A CAST TOGETHER (very hard): A minus; WHEN WATCHED: 11/30/2010; MY GRADE: B to B plus (for the particular genre).
B002X9W50E|5.0|David Bowie has released a number of live albums over the years, but not recently (I'm discounting the VH1 Story Tellers album, which was quite nice in itself). In 2003-04, Bowie undertook a major tour in support of his then-new album \\"A Reality\\". Due to subsequent health problems, it turns out to be to last major tour from Bowie, and for reasons unknown it has taken 7 years for a release from that tour. Better later than never.<br /><br />\\"A Reality Tour\\" (33 tracks; 156 min.) brings a collection of 2 shows recorded in Dublin on November 22-23, 2003. First of all, what a generous collection this is, at a very fan-friendly price. After that, when you listen to this, you can immediately pick up that Bowie is in great doings, interacting with the crowd and sounding fantastic. You know it's going to be a great evening when a crowd-favorite like \\"Fame\\" is just the 4th track on the album. This is by all means a \\"greatest hits live\\" and other assortments, augmented by a number of \\"A Reality\\" album tracks, which in and of themselves are very nice and fit in quite nicely. In fact, deep into CD2 we get \\"Bring Me the Disco King\\", one of those great tracks from \\"A Reality\\", and one of the highlights on here for me. In all, this is a fantastic live album, and a must for any Bowie fan.<br /><br />By happenstance, I had the good fortune of catching Bowie on this tour a couple of weeks before this was recorded, on October 27, 2003, in Munich, Germany, where I was on a business trip at the time. What a fantastic evening of music that was. My first and only time of seeing Bowie live in concert, and a highlight in my many years of concert going. So for me this album was a must-have right then and there. But even if you didn't see Bowie on this tour, I would recommend this album in a heartbeat to any Bowie fan, and this album is the \\"Live Album of the Year\\" for me.
B004498KPU|3.0|Well its Michael ,so i love that ,but the quality of the videos where poor ,I have a brand new 47in TV and a JVC home theater system , so they are not to blame , i have just about all MJ videos and the quality of History 11 and Dangerous our much better than ,Vision if Michael was alive to see this he would of never approved it ,and one more thing the videos did not fill my whole screen ,which i thought was odd . I am glad i got this at Amazon verse MJ tribute site Amazon saved me alot of money, So if want MJ short stories  and dont have them this will give you about all of them .
B004132HZS|5.0|Excellent modern Sherlock. I love it. The characters are facinating and real. The plots are highly interesting and draw you in and make you want more.
B000V9D5LG|5.0|I just got my Cannon camera and the lens.  Still learning but so far I love them both. I bought this lens to shoot my kids sporting events. I would recommend this lens.
B003X2O6KW|3.0|I was really looking forward to listening to this album after all the hype over it. And the first song - Dark Fantasy - didn't disappoint, it is a great intro with an uplifting chorus which really works. On the 2nd track - Gorgeous - Kanye is rapping with his voice `tinned' but the flow is good and you get the feeling  that if he could keep to that level throughout the album, then it would be a masterpiece. Unfortunately as the 3rd track - Power - starts with clapping and the beautiful female vocals singing \\"Uh, hey ay, uh!\\" you know exactly what is coming. It is going to be noisy, triumphant, even overwhelming with those vocals on constant loop. Great music but all designed to drown out West's mediocre mcing. After that the album is mostly downhill, apart from `Monster' which is a very interesting track. And there is no surprise that the production on this album is nearly flawless, it's Kanye West. But as hip hop it was always going to be handicapped by West's amateurish lyrics and even worse delivery. He throws in one or two good lines, but fills the rest of it with rubbish like this:    How `Ye doin'? I'm survivin'  I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'  Where the bad b******, huh? Where ya hidin'?  I got the power, make yo' life so excitin'            I have to say that I am very surprised at many of the critic's reviews. At what point did everyone decide that you can make a classic hip hop album when the MC rhymes by just adding  -in', it, -own to the end of incoherent phrases? But West is a very smart guy and he has tapped into pop culture where you are judged not only by your talents but by your celebrity. And in a stroke of genius he also made the album a celebrity treasure hunt so the American idol fans are fascinated, proudly declaring things like \\"Did you know that it was Elton John signing oooh la la at 4.12?!\\"    Overall MBDTF is a good album and on the first few listens it may even sound great. But those of us who value quality, intelligent lyrics will be left cold once effects of West's grand production have worn off and we can contemplate on the nonsense he has been spouting at us for the last hour. Try The Roots - How I got over, Nas & D. Marley or Kno - Death is Silent for 2010 releases with great rhyming as well as production.
B0043ISH6O|5.0|From front to back, this album is solid. Its biggest strength is also its biggest flaw: the music itself could fit a wide variety of films outside of \\"The Social Network\\" yet it does indeed mesh well given the plot. Fantastic work that is, regretfully, under-appreciated.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|I could write an essay of several thousands of works about this CD but I'll let you off easy.Here's all you need to know: 1.) Worlds greatest rock and roll band at the height of their powers 2).Mick Taylor in fine form whipping Keith into shape 3)Generally considered to among their best written material by most critics ever. Critics and Stones fans, It just don't get any better than This!!!!! I have many Stones shows but this is by far the best. A \\"MUST HAVE!!!!!!!

B0038M2AZA|5.0|My husband and I watched this last night and were very impressed and inspired by Temple Grandin who is the focus of this film. Having been diagnosed with autism in 1950 as a young child, Temple only began to speak (after lots of therapy) at the age of four. Temple was blessed with a supportive family and mentors in the form of teachers, therapists, etc. although she faced her share of prejudice and bullying, especially in middle and high school. Claire Danes portrays Temple with such insight and credibility that she is truly deserving of the Emmy award she won for this role.<br /><br />Temple Grandin's autism may have impaired her social skills somewhat, but what a brilliant mind! She invented the 'hug machine' for autistics who needed to be calmed when they were overstimulated, and she also developed ground-breaking methods for handling livestock, emphasizing humane handling. Today, Temple Grandin is a Professor at Colorado State University, and also a celebrated autism advocate.<br /><br />The movie, which is a semi-biographical account of Temple's early life and work in the field of livestock handling, manages to hit all the right notes. It is not sensational nor overly melodramatic and credibly portrays the struggles Temple faces on a daily basis as an autistic person. Things ordinary people take for granted, such as passing through an automatic sliding glass door, is portrayed as an almost insurmountable hurdle for Temple, who sees it as a guillotine! I loved the door metaphor which is used throughout the movie - each time Temple faces a challenge, she sees it as a door to be passed through to attain her objective! This is a must-see movie that will enable viewers to gain a deeper understanding of autism and its challenges.
1600242405|4.0|I am Johnny Depp fan, but he should not have been tapped to read this.  The book is great, Keith is in top form, great writing.  His memory is lucid and his prose throbs with heart, but Johnny Depp...Johnny Johnny Johnny...t he is way out of his league here.  He reads Kieth's story in one monotone, never varies (the same tone Johnny seems to reserve for all his readings of serious and influential rebel artists (aka Jack Kerouac) he never enunciates his words.  It gets so bad that I have my speakers full blast struggling to hear consonants!  Doesn't he know that there's no camera to show us his lips?  His voice has to be everything, meanwhile he's doing that screen acting thing where he doesn't want it to be overdone, but he waaaay underdoes it.  When he reads Keith's quotes in the voice of Jack Sparrow I get annoyed.  I am completely aware that Keith was the model for Captain Jack but I think Johnny underestimates how distracting that voice can be from the material.  Jack Sparrow brings its own goofy and quite famous context I can't get out of my mind and this is supposed to be about KIETH KIETH KIETH delving deeper than just JD's impression of him.<br />Oh well, I can blow til I'm blue in the face but Johnny will probably help sell a few more copies, which is all for the best since the book itself, as I've said is quite a delightful trip down memory lane with a man who paved the way for everything that followed.<br /><br />I'll also mention that when I preordered the audiobook I only did so because it was advertised that Keith would be reading this himself.  What a disappointment.  Now I realize that Keith Richards could never have sat in a studio and read this entire book...oh well.  Keith does a nifty intro and there's even a Stones guitar sound bite, which is cool.  I love hearing keith talk about making music.  So inspirational.  I could have done it without the Depp.  Sorry Johnny.<br /><br />(*****The following is an update to the previous review)<br /><br />Since I've begun listening to this audiobook something interesting happened: they switched readers mid-stream.  Somewhere after the third disc JOHNNY IS REPLACED!~  The good news is that he is replaced with someone who not only is British but does a wonderfully inflective impression of Keith throughout the rest of the discs.  I don't know who this bloke is but he is right on the money.  I don't know if this was preplanned or if Johnny didn't have the stamina (not that I could blame him, this is a loooong book) but this other guy who steps in to read the rest is clearly up to the task.  He is clearly a theatre or voice actor has a dynamic reflective reading voice that captures the cadence of Keith's speech perfectly - he also switches characters and accents quite well.  Excellent stuff!
B000002AH7|5.0|Great album of course.      If you like this I would highly recommend Tino Contreras' 1962 album Jazz Flamenco.  If you don't want to shell out $100 for a vinyl, then give Tino's Jazz Mariachi a shot.  Its not the original 1974 sessions, rather a 2010 fresh sessions with Tino's grand kids making up most of the band.. the last track is Betsabe Fantasia if you like Sketches of Spain.. Betsabe will blow you away.       I realize very few Americans know much about Mexican jazz, and might assume that Antonio Sanchez would be the runaway best jazz drummer from Mexico but he has a long way to go to match Tino's stature... Tino stands with a few Mexicans that should be considered up there with Miles Davis,  Coltrane, Charlie Parker etc., in the Jazz pantheon.    [...]
0060254920|3.0|I love this book so much & bought it for my 1 yr old son at a great price, to read to him but not allow him to play w/ it, because I would love him to have this for when he got older too...The paper cover w/ the title was ripped halfway down the page, the back part of the same cover was also ripped and stained...  I only wanted to leave this comment for the seller, but it is not allowing me to do that. I was really disappointed. The other 2 books I bought were in great condition, along with the inside of this book.
1840220554|4.0|There are a lot of different options as far as Austen collections go. They really aren't too hard to find; however this is one of the best values I've seen for one in a while. It is a big book, but still not too large to be a major issue. I bought this as a gift for a friend, because I felt this would make a perfect gift for that friend or relative that's been dying to delve into Austen.
0786956291|1.0|Talk about misleading advertising. This red box was supposed to be an introduction to the new Essentials line of D&D. However, the characters that you create with it are incompatible with the full classes as presented in Heroes of the Fallen Lands. They have different powers, or the powers are called differently, or similar powers have different effects, or some basic class/race features are missing. You will have to recreate your character or to make many, many adjustments to it. WotC have released a long Word document telling you how to convert the characters from this red box into the ones from Heroes of the Forgotten Lands (and that document, by the way, is incomplete - for example, it doesn't touch powers that are named the same but have actually different effects). What a VERY bad first experience for starters; this will completely discourage them from continuing playing, and defeats the entire idea of this red box. I'm not sure how it happened; probably different designers were assigned to the different products and weren't coordinating between them, or were coordinating based on an old draft that got invalidated at some point. I do not recommend getting this boxed set. Get Heroes of the Fallen Lands instead if you are a starter and avoid this introductory red box which will make your work much harder (and confusing) later on, having to convert your characters...    As a disclaimer: I'm a fan of 4E and have been playing it since early 2009.
B002CGSYNU|5.0|Replacement for the Olympus 14-42mm lens for MFT. The product is new and unopened. Did not consider 3rd party lens cap because of the poor fit (some that i have for other lenses).     p/s. Recommend to use a lens keeper for all lenses. Amazon has cheap offer for lens keeper as low as 30cents. That would have save me 10 bucks for this replacement. Just a thought.
B0048PU7TC|2.0|It is not her best work. I am a Norah fan, so I want more her, and less everyone else.
031262820X|5.0|Description and quality of the book were wonderful. Very honest about condition. When I received it, it was better than I had anticipated and the price was more than a bargain. But what really impressed me about this seller was the speed of the shipping. They must have sent it out same day because I received it within 3 days. I was amazed! Would definitely buy from them again if need be in the future. Thank you for such a great experience.
B000059TEQ|5.0|I loved this movie!  The humor adds a great element to the love story.  I'd definitely recommend this movie (I like it better than the book) for those who enjoy a good (though sad) romantic story.
B003ZK58WM|2.0|I am a huge fan of Ken Follett's historical fictions.  As always, I was not let down by Mr. Follett's research into the backdrop of this novel.  I would have given a five star review, but too often the story was bogged down because it reads like a Helequin Romance.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|Bought 3 of these cables to replace a set of HDMI 1.1 cables.  They are exactly what a HDMI cable should be priced at ($9.95 each when I bought them).  The cables are well constructed.  They come in a simple plastic bag rather than some ridiculous plastic container.  Video and Audio quality are superb, as one should expect from HDMI.  Do yourself a favor and skip over the Monster cables.  Monster cables are all a bunch of marketing BS.  These cables will perform just as well and for 1/10 the cost.  I opted for the braided cables like these for a bit more of a dressed up look.      One piece of advice concerning the braided cords.  They are a bit thicker than the regular cables and therefore, not as flexible.  Make sure you have the correct length as they are difficult to bundle up if you buy them too long.  Other than that, don't hesitate to buy these cables!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community is one of those shows that some people grow into, but I loved it instantly. However, I dare anyone who doesn't like it at first to still not like it by the 3rd or 4th episode. I have had friends who just didn't get it and didn't like it at first, but by the 3rd episode they warmed up to it and now it is their absolute favorite show. To hear talk about it now, you'd never know they kind of hated the first episode. I didn't hate it... I don't hate any episode. They had a fantastic first season and watching these characters grow and find themselves makes for great television. Dan Harmon really knows what he's doing and he knows funny. You can also tell that everyone who works on the show loves the show and loves working with each other. Community actually has a lot of heart in it which I feel it doesn't get enough credit for. Amid the craziness and hilarity, there is a genuine sweetness with these characters. By the end of the season you will feel like they are a real family... and you might kind of feel like a part of that family too.     The video and audio is pretty standard for DVD (I wish they had released it on Blu-Ray), but the show still looks fantastic. Community has a very movie/film quality feel to it and that has a lot to do with the cameras they chose to use. I know this because of the commentaries.    This brings me to the extras. They really put effort into these extra. We have a commentary on every single episode! Dan Harmon, the creator of the show, is present for all of them and various actors, directors, and writers cycle through. All the commentaries are great to listen to and tell you a lot about the mood on the set and gives you insight into the mind of Dan Harmon. If you follow him on Twitter you probably already have a pretty good idea of that, though. When you listen to the cast you can just tell that these guys hang out when they're not working. They genuinely like each other and that comes across in the show.    After the commentaries we have outtakes on every disc from every episode! Again this is fantastic stuff because we get to see a lot of the improv stuff that Donald Glover and Danny Pudi perform that didn't make it into the episode. Then rounding out the top tier of the extras are the \\"cast evaluations\\" done by Dan Harmon and the so-hilarious-it-hurts \\"Creative Compromises.\\"    I haven't bought a DVD or a DVD set since I started buying Blu-Rays and I told myself I would not buy anything unless it was on Blu. However there doesn't seem to be a push to get this on Blu so I made my one and only exception for Community. This show deserves to be on the air for a long time.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I normally do not write reviews for anything but this book knocked my socks off.  I couldn't stop thinking about it, I couldn't stop talking about it!  Everyone I ran into I would tell them you have to read ROOM.  My husband knew the whole story from my accounts.  It was a heartbreaking story at the same time as being a heart-lifting story ~ not an easy feat.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE SOUND OF MUSIC AND YOU ARE A FAN YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS NEW BLUE RAY COPY IT IS BEYOND BELIEF! ITS LIKE SEEING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME AGAIN ,THE CLARITY IS BEYOND BELIEF OF THE PICTURE AND THE SOUND IS FANTASTIC!IT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY! A CLASSIC THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL ENJOY!!
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I enjoyed the movie..Lot's of action and quite entertaining...If you are looking for Academy Award winning stuff, this one's not for you. Hugh Jackman rocks as Wolverine!!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I actually had never heard of this show before.  I'm not even certain as to when it actually aired.  I bought the set mostly because the price was so reasonable for the season.  However, I fell in love with Everwood.  I do sometimes get tired of listening to the teenage son complain.  Sometimes I think I'd like to smack him and tell him to get over it, but that's just me.  I charge extra for whining!!!  The other characters are wonderful.  I live in a small town like Everwood, so it was delightful to watch the characterization.  I so relate to them.  I'm going to buy the other two seasons now.    !
B00007LTIB|5.0|I feel that this was always YES's best album. Its totally amazing. After listening to GATES you may have to ask yourself where have I been the last 20 minutes? The music allows you to drift off and listen at the same time. The funny thing is they have managed to make the music even better. CD's are normally on the flat (compressed} side but listening to this new CD it rocks! The extra studio run-through (previously unissued) version of GATES OF DELIRIUM is some of the most exciting, awesome YES music ever made. Hale to ALAN WHITE. Buy this new released version. You won't regret it.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This movie perfectly blends history with drama!  Unlike many films, this is well researched and doubly great due to the reenactors that were the extras.  They told the director if something was not historically correct.  With a cast of hundreds of reenactors, no small detail was left out. The cast themselves said that the reenactors made the movie great.  I agree.
B0040YFR1Y|3.0|Out of the gate I want to say I had high hopes for this movie.  With both of the newer alien versus predator movies we got predators who were not the alpha stealth hunter I came to love in the first movie.  This movie tries to bring us back to the original formula with a jungle terrain,humans with big guns and predators who are stalking them.  Essentially the formula is right but something seems to be missing.<br /><br />  First off the tension that the movie is trying create with the idea of always being hunted is non existent.  This may be due my second issue, all of the characters are mostly unrelateable stereotypes who seem like husks of people.  Tension can't really exist when the viewer doesn't care if any of the characters live or die.  And finally the build up to the climax of the movie is ultimately quite boring, because of issues one and two and that most of the action takes place in the last 20 to 30 minutes of the movie.  It seems like many of the fodder characters could have been killed at earlier points to keep up the pace, but live just to killed in the last half an hour.<br /><br />Overall I feel the movie could have been much better given all of the elements but failed to deliver on what the original did.  I would have rated a 2.5 stars but the end action allows it to just make it to 3.
B003WTE886|5.0|I looove this CD. It's just asgood as her other CDs. Love her music. You won't be disappointed. Prompt arrival too.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|?This is a unique collection of music.  The Producer  has definitely achieved a whole new  sound and trend for Josh. The combination works and I don't sense an ounce of gimmickicy top 40 music. It is a more raw and pure sound, not drowned out by instruments. Groban's  talent truly shines in this album. I highly recommended it to friends. Not every song is great but you will not be disappointed.  Illuminations\\" is undoubtedly Groban's strongest effort yet. I have been a long time Groban fan and this album is very different than his previous work.
B0013ND36G|4.0|Terminator 3 may not be the classics of Terminator and Terminator 2 Judgement Day but it is still a worthy sequel and much much better than the horrible plot that was Terminator Salvation. The movie also still has the real Arnold in it which is a staple of the Terminator series.    Many people complain that the movie is too humurous and not as dark as the others. But I say the epic ending of this movie proves that wrong. And any humor in this movie only expands off of Terminator 2's humor. The action in this movie is very intense and the chase scenes rival even that of Terminator 2. Terminator 3 also expands and moves the Terminator plot foward unlike Terminator Salvation.    The picture and sound are top notch and the visual effects are amazing. The only downside to this movie is there is no Sara Conner and her death seemed cheap only by explanation. Other than that this is a good sequel and great to add as a third chapter. Salvation stands as the onlybad terminator movie for one simple reason why wouldn't skynet just kill Kyle Reese as soon as they identified him. This ruined the entire Salvation film. Oh well.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|I recently wrote a review on this very site for the original Swedish version; \\"Let the Right One in\\" or \\"Lat Den Ratte Komma In\\", I also mention in the review that I initially saw the American version; \\"Let Me In\\" first, so it's only fitting that I do a review of this adaptation as well.    Both films are masterfully done by their respective directors and cinematographers, both films have a well written script and a fine talented cast. Main difference in my opinion and this is where I favor the original over the American version is that \\"Let the Right One In\\" was scripted by the original author John Ajvide Lindqvist so it more closely follows the novel. The child actors in this version as with the original turn in great inspiring performances considering the source material; Kodi Smit Phee(the Road) and especially Chloe Grace Moretz(Kick Ass)turn in very effective and emotionally packed portrayals of the main characters Owen/Oskar and Abby/Eli.    If you're looking for the traditional Vampire tale then you will be dissapointed, no senseless gore or violence, no hapless dimwitted victims running about...just good intelligent storytelling and fine acting.Some folks have compared this to a younger version of \\"Twilight\\" which in my opinion insults this film as it does the original version-this is far better, both in story and performance. The film has of course been \\"Americanized\\", instead of taking place in Stockholm in the early 1980s it takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico at the same time period. Director Matt Reeves(Cloverfield) captures the era accurately with some very minor goofs and captures the mood admirably, the only thing is he folowed the original film \\"too\\" closely at times, you'd almost swear it was done \\"shot for shot\\" in certain scenes. But where I damn him for that I must also commend him on the adaptation in general, he switched out a few scenarios and changed some supporting characters which help make this version all the more enjoyable. Veteran character actor Richard Jenkins turns in a fine performance as the care giver to Abby despite the fact that he has so few lines-same goes for actor Elias Koteas who plays the investigating detective(a character not in the original-this part was originally a nosy neighbor in the Swedish film and novelization).The character of Abby has been more softened in this adaptation, more caring or manipulative if you prefer than as is translated from the original Eli in \\"Let The Right One In\\".    Owens parents are practically non-existent in this version which also is a key difference from the original so you do not feel too badly with Owen's decision to leave with Abby at the end. I prefer the original film but I do like how they adapted this version...The main reason to check this version out is of course the story and for its fine performances, especially the kids Kodi Smitt Phee and Chloe Grace Moretz. If you are a fan of tragic love stories then this will be a rewarding find.
B000UBMWG4|3.0|As a big fan of the movie, I was really anticipating watching Blade Runner on Blu-Ray on my new HDTV. However, it was a disappointment. Not just because the changes in the Final Cut didn't do much for me, but also because of the changes they made in the Director's Cut, which I thought was going to simply be the same as the DVD release, but at higher resolution. I was wrong. One of the reasons I really like the Director's Cut is the unicorn scene, and that's one of the changes that bummed me out about this Blu-Ray release. Originally the unicorn scene is tinted a beautiful, dreamy yellow, and in combination with the Vangelis music, it's just an epic thing to watch. For some reason, though, they got rid of the tint in BOTH the Blu-Ray Final Cut and Director's Cut versions, leaving the scene with normal light and thus feeling less transcendent, less emotional, and more mundane. Very disappointed in that. They have also messed with the coloration of other scenes, such as Deckard's first scene in the movie, where he's sitting in the rain, waiting for a seat at the Japanese food stand. It was originally awash with a beautiful deep, moody blue; now it's kind of a harsh, electric white. The same for the food stand, which had a lot more atmospheric lighting with lots of yellow elements; now it seems kind of washed out, too. There may be more changes in coloration for the rest of the movie, but I haven't made it that far in my viewing yet. I really wish they had just updated the special effects and not messed with the color palette, which was perfect before. What a let-down. I will therefore be hanging onto my DVD two-disc edition of the Director's Cut and sadly I will endure the low resolution when I want to watch it, because even with low resolution it's visually superior to this messed up release in the Blu-Ray edition. I hope they do a re-release of the Director's Cut in Blu-Ray with the original coloration someday.
0739384198|5.0|Stieg Larson's three books are wonderful audiobooks enjoy by both men and women.  I keep hearing the phrase \\"hard to put down\\" (the book) and I strongly recommend it.  This book is mentioned a lot by our book club members.
B0037AGASG|5.0|Look, I think some products should be reviewed from the perspective of a kid not an adult and this is certainly one of them. Our 9y/o daughter loves JB and will be so excited to get this on x-mas. She listens to his songs on demand and at her friends houses. As parents we may not like his songs or may think his lyrics are silly singing about love at 16. However, when I was a kid it was New Kids, N Sync, and Backstreet Boys. So try to put your self in your kids shoes when reading the reviews for this album. It's marketed for tweens and teens not for adults. His songs are up beat and catchy which is why the kids love it. The price is fair as well. If you have a teen or tween who is a JB fan then get this, I am sure they'll love it.
0525423273|5.0|I love everything about this book, from the flawed but oh-so-ridiculously-sexy love interest to Anna and her discovery of Paris and herself. One of my all time favorite YA books--smart, funny, yummy, and incredibly well-written. Oh la la! Read it and you, too, will fall in love in Paris with Anna and Etienne. You'll also fall in love with Perkins, one of the best new voices in contemporary YA in years!
B00475BUVM|1.0|I purchased this move because I love 3d veiwing.  The 3d in this move is almost noexistant.   The movie itself was OK but the 3d portion is beyond weak.  I bought this movie thinking the 3d effects   would be great seeing the different monsters it had in it but you had to stain to see any 3d effects.    None worth even mentioning. If you want to see this movie just buy the bluray version and save your self money and aggravation of trying to fine and good 3d in it. I just want to say I have bought many items on Amazon and have always been happy with there service. It is not there fault this movies 3d sucks.
B003X2O6KW|4.0|I have a problem of not being able to separate personal feelings about an artist/actor/etc with their work.  Kanye is far from an admirable person, but try as I might, I cannot not like this album.  It's a little raw and overly angry at times (Monster), but the lyrics and beats are impressive and carry you away.

B00004SZWD|5.0|I'm a year older than Stevie Wonder and have liked his music since he was clappin' hands as Little Stevie Wonder. This album is built upon his extra-ordinary musical gifts and seems a natural progression from the earlier recordings. To me, Stevie's most serious music was expressed in \\"Talking Book\\", extended with the topical and lyrical \\"Innervisions\\", and then came to creative fulfullment with \\"Songs In The Key Of Life\\". It's not a just a collection of great songs... it's an honest statement of emotons from a man with a special gift to make us feel it in our soul. It's as real as music gets and I believe Stevie's music compares favorably to the best music made by any artist of his time.
044654759X|5.0|This book was amazing. So good. I laughed, cried, and just really enjoyed this book. Very easy to read and the characters are very easy to imagine. I thought this was such a good read and very interesting. It is a typical love story but with a surprising sercret at the end. I would really reccommend this book to anyone who loves to read.
0312243022|5.0|I was bored after being in the hospital for six weeks, so I picked up a novel. You might ask why would someone pick up such a depressing novel in a convalescence state. The answer I know not. I watched the film before about five years ago and I wanted to occupy my time.    The Hours is a novel that the deals with the lives of three women. Mrs Dalloway the modern Clarissa Vaughn, Mrs Brown, and Virginia Woolf. The three women faced tragic fates. Virginia Woolf committed suicide by drowning. Mrs Brown left her marital home and learned of her son's suicide at the end of the book. Vaughn had to deal with the loss of her dear friend Richard Brown on an eventful night.    Michael Cunningham deals with the anguish of the mentally ill and how it affects the lives of their love ones. Woolf committed suicide because of her need to escape from her predicament when she suffered from a bout of manic depression, while Richard Brown committed suicide due to a bout of depression result from his suffering of AIDS.     One can learn from this book that the mentally ill do not like their symptoms from Woolf's suicide note. They learn to cope with it but then sometimes the anguish overcomes them and leads them to make desperate acts. One can also learn that there are different reasons why people commit suicide and it seems like the only way out for these people.

SHE CAN'T DANCE BUT WHO CARES...SASSY BURLESQUE, EVEN LOVELY AND LOVING...NOW THAT MAKES IT A MOVIE , NOT HARDCORE PORN.  I LIKE THIS MOVIE...WHAT CAN I SAY.  THEY SEEMED LIKE REAL PEOPLE.  OH YES, THERE WAS A LOT BORROWED, LIKE THE SCENE AT THE CLOTHES RACK WHEN CHRISTINE IS BEING HANDED HER COSTUMES; THAT'S STRAIGHT OUT OF 'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' BUT BY THE TIME THE CAST IS FINISHED WITH YOU...YOU FEEL APART OF THEIR FAMILY-AT-THE-CLUB TOO.

B000H22NVU|5.0|Great Service!  I'm anxious to read this book ... as soon as I finish the two I've already started!  Thanks!
B0049VZ2UY|5.0|I've been really happy with this season so far. It's not just a zombie show, but there's plenty of zombie action to remind you that they are there. There's lot of emotion and thought provoking narrative to make the show interesting on several levels. I'd recommend this show to anyone who is looking for a good drama with fine acting and good writing. A desire to watch a realistic show that also has zombies is not necessary, but will definitely be rewarded.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|The movie packaging and quality was great.  What I liked most, however, is that the seller, stormydaybooks, provided some very interesting triva about the actresses. This was a great touch and I can't wait to order from them again.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|It's simply what it was supposed to be nothing more. Brainless action movie, it was obvious that Sly Stallone had a lot of fun making this movie. In fact, I have a feeling he made this movie for fun. He purposley put in the best Action heros of our time and put them into the big screen which made it even more awesome. The scene with him, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger was so Sylvester Stallone having a reunion with the last true action heros. I'm blabbing, just watch it.

It is SO much better than the 2009-2010 or the latest version of today.  I almost purchased it after seeing it and came across the original and so glad I purchased the original instead.  You will laugh, cry from laughing and totally enjoy it and the special features included in the DVD are extra special too!  Buy it you won't be disappointed.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I love fantasy.  This is a great series to satisfy that need.  Craig Horner and the cast are fabulous.  I recommend getting both season 1 and 2.  I am sorry that Disney won't sponsor a season 3.  If you like fantasy, you'll love this DVD!!  Adventure, romance, plot, and great acting!!!
B0034JKZ86|4.0|I heard mixed reviews on this movie from family and friends, seems they either love it or hated it.  So I got it for my girls, 5 & 2.  It kind of reminded us alot of Aladdin; with the bad man and some dark scary parts, I could live without the voodoo scenes; but I guess how else could they have turned the Prince into a Frog without it??  I did have to answer a lot of questions from my oldest about what is voodoo, coming up with creative ways to answer that as to not scare or confuse her more.  Overall, they both really enjoyed the movie, the songs were really cute.  There is one song in particular that when we watch the movie, they beg me to go back and play it over and over (Going down the Bayou sung by Ray Ray)  Speaking of loveable Ray Ray the firefly...he does get squashed in the end and dies, and my 5 year old did cry the first time, it was sad, but it did have a purpose when he turns into a \\"star\\" and ends up next to his true love in the sky.    I really ended up liking this movie and seem to like it more each time I watch it.  I like the message in it; work hard, have big dreams, and don't give up or take the easy way out.  I think its a must have for any Disney fan, Princess fan, or movie collector.
0765356139|4.0|I have read a number of books by Sanderson and loved them all.  I loved Warbreaker, Elantris, and the first Mistborn book.  I was excited to read more about Vin and Elend, and find out about the bigger disasters that happened after they took over the city.  This was a great book and a great addition to the series.<br /><br />This book starts shortly after Mistborn ended.  Vin is spending time trying to keep Elend safe from assassins and Elend is trying to set up government in the city of Luthadel.  Unfortunately two armies have camped outside of Luthadel and they both want Luthadel for its Atium.  Elend is trying to figure out how to stave off envasion when he finds out about the threat of a third armed force.  Vin is pushing herself trying to guard the city full time when she runs into another mysterious Mistborn, to add to the mystery she thinks things are changing with the Mists and that Luthadel may be facing a danger much bigger than any invading armies.<br /><br />This was a really wonderful book.  Sanderson has such a way with characters; they are all so lovable and human.  He balances out politics, action, and characterization so well.  I was really attached to the characters in this book...and there are a lot of them.  I never felt like it was hard to keep them all straight and I never found the magic system and politics too confusing.  It takes a great writer to craft a story this complex and still make it easy for the reader to follow.<br /><br />This book was politics heavy, especially for the first two-thirds.  I am not a big fan of complex prolonged politics, so I didn't like this book quite as much as the first one.  That being said it is a testament to Sanderson's skill that I was still completely engaged in this story despite the fact that the first part focused almost solely on the politics surrounding Luthandel.  The end of the book races by twice as fast as the first part and is packed with battle and action.<br /><br />This book touches on a lot of deep issues as well such as good vs evil, democracy vs. dictatorship, morality and ethics.  These are all well balanced with the other elements of the book.  Sanderson makes epic fantasy more personable and I love the fact that women play large roles in his books.  When I was younger I always got sick of epic fantasies that either ignored women or featured them in weak, less desirable roles.  This book is about Elend and Vin in equal parts and it is wonderful to see that.<br /><br />We learn a lot more about the history of some of the different races and also a lot more about Allomancy.  The story ends in a great spot, tying up many of the issues presented early on while starting a big story for the third book.<br /><br />Overall an absolutely excellent book.  Sanderson is just such a fabulous writer; his writing is complex, easy to read, engaging, creative and absolutely engrossing.  I am very excited to read the final book in the trilogy, The Hero of Ages, to see how it all plays out.

B003EV6DBW|4.0|I was introduced to Doctor Who through the renewed series one and onward.  Matt Smith has got to be my favorite Doctor of them all.    I think the Blu-Ray set is very nice and the discs all look amazing, and amazing quality.  The only thing I don't like it the cover of my set. It's that material that makes it look 3-D but it just gives me a headache.  Still loved the little art cards and I won't be doing anything for a long time until I finish re-watching this series.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|I like Monopoly and I like Nintendo. Sticking the two together made a really fun game! I would recommend it for anyone who likes games! The pieces are super adorable too, so they can be used for display
B003UERZ88|5.0|This is a highly eclectic album, maybe even a bit schizophrenic - but it works like a charm!  I was initially quite surprised by it as it sounds almost nothing like either Resurrection or Crucible, both of which I love, so I wasn't sure what to think.  Also, the sport-themed lyrics (NASCAR, boxing, bullfighting) did not sit well and I still think they are quite lame.  However, this album has really grown on me, and I completely love it now.  It seems that Rob and the boys decided to just enjoy themselves and make an album full of songs they like without worrying about any kind of an overall concept.  The band really sounds like they're having fun!  They visit a lot of classic territory, including the-Stained-Class-era-sounding Hell Razor, and early-to-mid-'80s-sounding Speed of Sound, Like There's No Tomorrow, and Heartless, which would have also fitted in nicely on Resurrection.  There's also a bit of power-metal with Undisputed and Fire and Ice, and even a classic power ballad Twenty-Five Years, which somehow manages to rise above the cliches while seemingly embracing them.  The biggest surprise for me were the two melodic-metal songs: We Own The Night and I Know We Stand a Chance.  These sound like some modern Nordic metal, with romantic lyrics and even some piano tinkling, courtesy of Roy Z.  I don't think Rob has ever done anything like these songs before, but from my perspective they completely work, despite undoubtedly being quite disappointing to many metalheads, especially those expecting to hear Crucible II.  They're both just beautiful songs, and I'd love to hear more from Halford along these lines.  Speaking of Roy Z, he proves a more-than-worthy sideman to Rob, as he did to Bruce Dickinson.  His signature songwriting is all over the album, as is his stunning guitar playing (his solo in Undisputed is truly brain-scrambling, even astounding!!).  Many of the songs he co-wrote with Rob for this album sound similar to some of the stuff on Dickinson's last solo album, Tyranny of Souls, highly melodic but also occasionally very heavy.  I'm really happy to see him in Halford, he's a perfect fit.      The album is not a complete triumph from my perspective,  Thunder and Lightning sounds too much like mid-'80s hair metal, bringing up unpleasant flashbacks of Bon Jovi and Dokken, certainly not something worthy of the Metal God.  Also, the bluesy Till the Day I Die just doesn't work for me, it sounds flat and boring, as well as being too jarring of a departure, even on an album this eclectic.  Similarly, Matador is a bit too cheesy, not only lyrically but also musically.  Finally, The Mower closes the album with a bit of Crucible-like heaviness, which seems completely out of place here - the bigger problem being that the song is ultimately not as good as anything on Crucible, rather being much ado about not much at all.      Nevertheless, despite these few missteps, I have grown to really love this album, and I appreciate Rob's willingness to take a few chances and stretch, even at the risk of falling flat on his face!  It's clear that Rob considers Halford to be an outlet for his creative energies which don't fit in the Priest, and we're very lucky that he chooses to give us all this great music rather than just enjoy his downtime on some Caribbean island!  I'm sure it's also liberating for him to not really have to worry about making money with Halford, giving him the freedom to try different things.  I'm greatly looking forward to seeing what else Rob, Roy, Mike and the boys have in the store for us in the future.  Given the four albums so far, one thing seems for sure: it'll be something quite unexpected!!  Good.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|I've been a long time follower of Christina's music career as I have always admired her voice. I wouldn't exactly put myself in the die-hard, she-can-do-know-wrong fan category, but I am still an avid listener. That being said, I honestly had low expectations for the movie and the music. Whenever a singer makes her first movie debut, it's more often than not a total disaster. I don't believe this was the case for \\"Burlesque\\". The music really fits the movie well, and is what it is intended to be: Fun, catchy, and energetic. If you're looking for something deep, soulful and epic...Burlesque is not your album, or your movie. It's meant to be fun, and entertaining...brought to you by two women who know all about that. I like this album for what it is, and it's great listening for a workout! But don't take it too seriously, because it's not meant to be!
B00133KFGW|1.0|This is a review of the movie--not the DVD.<br /><br />I first want to comment how astounding it is that the audience \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rottentomatoes.com for this movie is over 80%, whereas the critics have provided less than 35% positive reviews.  This is one where the audience needs to pull its head out of its rear and realize that a cute kid, a pretty actress, Robin Williams, and the IDEA of a good story do not a good movie make.<br /><br />The concept of a wanted-but-lost child who is a musical prodigy searching for his parents, and entering into said concept as the audience with the faint promise of a happy ending, is all more than okay with me.  The problems I have is how much farther the movie demands I stretch the license I give it to ignore reality.  I'll buy that this kid can \\"hear\\" his parents, that he's the most gifted musical prodigy to have ever been born, that his grandfather is a mean and selfish man to the point of secretly giving the kid up for adoption, that somehow two people know they're \\"meant for each other\\" after a one-night-stand, and even (spoiler alert) that the boy can turn around at the end of his concert and see his parents and immediately know who they are.<br /><br />I will not, however, buy that he can sight-read sheet music after a 7-year-old girl shows him what a quarter note is, or that an inner-city pastor can walk a kid through the front doors of Juilliard and get him enrolled in classes, or that such a young boy would be allowed to participate in such a high-profile concert when no one even knows who his parents are.  Also unforgiveable is the editing during the musical scenes, where the camera doesn't stop panning.  It's unforgiveable because 1) it's irritating, and 2) it's quickly obvious that the purpose is to try to distract you from the fact that the filmmakers couldn't be troubled to hire a very good musical consultant.  If you're a guitarist like me, or really any kind of musician, watching Evan and others \\"play\\" guitar is painful.  You hear solo parts when all the actors are doing is strumming, or hear the guitarist slide up on the neck and the actors move down, if at all.  Then there's the part when Evan touches a piano for the first time--it's clear as day that it's the wrong note.  And this isn't a perfect pitch kind of thing--the kid was not even at the right octave.  How is it that someone decides to make a movie that is built around music but can't be bothered to make it appear that the instruments are actually being played?<br /><br />Like I said, the concept of the movie sounds beautiful, but its execution is gut-wrenching.solo parts when all the actors are doing is strumming, or hear the guitarist slide up on the neck and the actors move down, if at all.

B000002VMD|4.0|Whitney Houston's first soundtrack has a bunch of accolades: Album of the Year, Song of the Year, best-selling soundtrack of all time, and a bunch of awards and popularity. There's nothing really bad to say about this album, but I don't think that I love it, indicating a 5-star rating. You have your tear-jerker opening with \\"I Will Always Love You,\\" an award-winner and record-breaker on Billboard chart but a remake of Dolly Parton. You have the emotional strong love song \\"I Have Nothing\\" which was performed in the related movie onstage. The remake of \\"I'm Every Woman,\\" originally done by Chaka Khan, was brilliant. \\"Run to You\\" is a slow love song. \\"Queen of The Night\\" is an upbeat flaunting track. The rest of the tracks off this soundtrack were mediocre. \\"Theme from Bodyguard\\" just plays a violin. \\"Someday (I'm Coming Back\\" by Lisa Stansfield is an optimistic love track.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I'm big on protecting my investments.  This case was the perfect fit and it keeps me from misplacing my Bluetooth. Its easy to slip into my purse when I'm not using it and keeps it from being damaged. I would say it's a must have.

Other than fit it is a very nice little bag with a belt loop.
0143118420|1.0|I listened to this on tape and found my mind wandering almost the whole time. Her monitone drone was a snooze. Or was it the content? I did try to pay attention to the Italy portion, but even this wonderful country, which she narrated as a history teacher, was a snore after a bit. So glad I did not waste money on this drivel. She is a bore.
0553805371|4.0|Is there God? I hope there is, but it looks like there isn't. Why do we exist? We exist because we do.<br /><br />If people's answer to the \\"Why\\" is something about God, then they may just subconsciously try to avoid the question or the actual answer is too hard for them to imagine. If life on the Earth exists because of God, then Who (or, What) created God? Living in this immense world, people would sometimes feel vulnerable. When they are helpless and alone, physically or mentally, they may resort to a higher power. They need some ideas or hopes to cling to so that they won't break down. That's why God exists. And it exists in our heart.<br /><br />The authors reviewed parts of classic and modern physics for the readers in the first six chapters, preparing us for the statements pertaining to the probable answer. As a student majored in phyics, I found the reading was mostly easy and smooth. The argument of the authors is quite reasonable.<br /><br />Do I believe in God? I do. But I believe my God is those possibilities that I can succeed, I can do anything good, I can love and I can be loved. I want to make the most of my life, whether there is a meaning given to it or not.<br /><br />I think I have found an answer to the \\"Why\\" question. Will you?
B00493AD74|5.0|I have been to India, and I was happy to see that in this movie they actually showed the beggar children that will surround you and some of the garbage problems, most movies about India doesn't show that part. Good Job.    I grew up somewhat poor; when all my school friends played or did their homework, I had to cut wood, carry wood, pick weeds etc etc. I received work boots as the only Christmas gift and work gloves for my birthday. I had to wear my older brother's used clothes. We couldn't afford to turn on the heat in my room, it was around 50 degrees in my room in the winter.    Since when is it wrong to follow your heart? This movie is about following your heart, not self indulgence. She is not following every whim and desire, she is trying to do the right thing by following her heart. Your heart truly knows what's right and wrong. And that power comes from within you, not outside. Is that scary and/or dangerous to some people?     Before you can help anyone else, you have to help yourself, that is not self indulgent, it's called common sense.    She collected 18k for that lady who had gone through such hard times, selfish??    Blaming this movie for your personal problems doesn't make sense to me. If you have all this time dissing this movie and are so unhappy in your personal life, couldn't you do something more useful with your time, energy and money?    When I was growing up I never even had any money to go to the movies, we never had a VCR either. I grew up in the 70's and 80's. You have money and time to spend on movies, and you're poor?    I've also been through some traumatic experiences in my life. To keep on being reminded that I have the power to steer my thoughts in any direction I choose is great and empowering. When you have been through a trauma, memories of the bad experience keeps coming back, and you might feel helpless sometimes. It is not a new concept to me, but it felt great being reminded of that I truly have the power to change that.Thank you guys for making an awesome movie. Made me feel  a bunch happier and lighter :)
B0002JJBZY|5.0|I bought these right before the re-mastered versions came out - at a steep discount.  For the most part, on my HDTV, they look fine:  there is occasional graininess in the images and similar distortions, but really, they are just fine.  Indeed, they look about as sophisticated as they did when I first saw them on TV, which ironically is a great plus for me as I remember the 1960s crudeness with great pleasure.  Thus, I would recommend this version warmly, if you can get it at a good price somewhere as it is no longer available.  In my humble opinion, the souped-up version is fine, but ultimately unnecessary unless you can't watch an old show in all its glorious outdatedness.  This really is the best TV there has ever been.
B003AYPMBU|5.0|I picked this up because I didn't have this masterpiece on CD (I know, crazy) and liked that it was remastered.  I didn't even care about the DVD.  I just listened to the CD and was floored.  It sounds so good that I was sure it must have been re-recorded.  This is probably how good it sounded coming out of the studio monitors in 1980.  I learned how to play rock guitar by playing along with this album.  A pure metal classic.  Can't believe I could have had it in 2001.
0375413405|5.0|I have used this book for a number of years.  It has absolutely wonderful ideas of basic french recipes, including the needed techniques and equipment.  No matter what essential ingredients you have - a specific cut of beef, half a cabbage, bad alsatian white wine - you can consult this book and put together a meal.  Best of all, it gives you a sense of what goes with what for a successful mix of flavors.  The techniques are also described at a level that beginners can use them.  We will use this for the rest of our life.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that many of the recipes are difficult to put together.  References to other pages pop up that you didn't notice on first reading, necessitating the search for additional ingredients, etc.  This can throw off your timing, but it is also confusing as you must find the right place in the reference and remember where you left off on the other recipe.  In other words, you have to be very careful to have it all in your head, unlike many of the current cook books that have complete self-contained recipes on one page.<br /><br />But this is a minor frustration.  I have spent many hours poring through the book for ideas, which is a true delight and results in a creation that the whole family shares.  Warmly recommended.  We are still on volume 1 after 10 years!
B0030U1U6A|5.0|Judging from the quality of the previous reviews one can see that it's pretty well hardcore GG fans that wrote them. This truncated review is an update to what has been expressed so wonderfully before. Aside from the amazing and powerful music that In a glass house provides it is the high quality of the recording that really pulls things together. My earliest memories of this album are from the days of vinyl and I have been forever searching to find that sound again from the various cd remasters. I can now state unequivocally that this new 2010 remaster hits the nail on the head. I always found the older versions to be lacking in delivering that big, intense sound that GG is known for. Even the original analog version of this album has been trumped by modern technology. Dump your old versions and turn the volume up high with the new disc provided your system can stand it.
1595141715|5.0|Wow. Just wow. I feel like I need to start a round of applause for Jay Asher because what he has done here, it's amazing. The story starts with Clay Jensen, a nice, wholesome, all around good guy who receives a package of cassette tapes narrated by a dead girl. A dead girl who committed suicide and who names thirteen different people as a contributing factor on the tapes. Clay is one of those people.<br /><br />Hannah Baker's suicide comes as a surprise to most everyone in the community, but she chronicles her feelings and her decision through 7 tapes and 13 people. Asher uses the dual narrative of Hannah and Clay to lead the reader back to the moment when it happened; when and how Hannah decided to give up and just why these 13 people are so important in that decision. The dual narrative is confusing at times, but I got used to it quickly.<br /><br />Asher doesn't shy away from the stigma that surrounds suicide, he embraces it. Hannah Baker is selfish for what she does, but in a way, she knows that. To me, suicide is an incredibly selfish act because the people who are left behind, those are the ones that suffer, but Hannah's reasoning is all too common. What happens to her happens in real life, all too often. And her thirteen reasons - while some may not seem good enough - are enough to lead her to her final action. Clay's part in the tapes, in Hannah's life, and in the aftermath, drives the reader to continue on. He forces us to care for Hannah even when what she's doing seems horrible, because he cares.<br /><br />Part mystery, part suspense, and sadly, realistic, Th1rteen R3asons Why is a moving look into suicide and how one person's actions can change another forever. It's been a long time since I've read a book that made me want to do more, to be better, and to always consider my actions, but this book has done just that. Asher's debut is powerful, honest, and all-too real. Th1rteen R3asons Why is a book that is more than worthy of its praise and I only hope that it has the same effect on others as it had on me.<br /><br />Opening lines: \\"Sir?\\" she repeats. \\"How soon do you want it to get there?\\" ~ pg. 1<br /><br />Favorite lines: I'm listening to someone give up.

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|If you've never seen '24' don't buy this season, wait for the box set.  Every episode, in all seasons, is a 'cliff-hanger' (instead of just a 'season finale').  Possibly season 8 is not the best season, but the worst season (not this) still deserves 5 stars.    Luckily, I never saw it on TV - simply wouldn't be able to wait a week for the next episode, and,  in fact, watched one of the seasons in a day!    One of the few (recent) TV series you can enjoyably watch many times.

If you were a Daria fan...  this is a must have!

After finding out that Percy would not be the main character of this book I was a little worried that I wouldn't like it but I was wrong. The only bad thing I have to say is now I have nothing left to read!    I have read all the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books, this book (The Lost Hero), the Red Pyramid, and all the Harry Potter and Twilight books so I have nothing left to read. Feel free to leave comments with suggestions for what I could read next.

Lost is a compilation of many interacting story lines and continually keeps you on the edge of your seat. To fully respect and understand the phenomena that is Lost I truly reccomend this collection. You will not regret the decision as once you get UN-Lost (if thats possible still have to watch season 6), you will admire the wonderful package this collection comes in and all the accessories that will bring the sole of Lost into your home. Last peice of advice is if you are plan to start, be sure to plan to finish and pay attention!

Knowing that it was not historically accurate I at least expected something entertaining, good cinematography or interesting images.  I was left feeling...empty.  This was a waste of money and time.  I usually donate movies that I have watched and tired of or movies that I don't like.  In this case I broke the disk and threw it in the trash.
B0041KOVUU|5.0|i have been following this band since i was 13. im glad that they continue to make music. im not one of those douch's that cant let go of the old line up. i understand that music and all art is an exploration. i can say i really love three of the four tunes that are on therelease of this album. but im over joyed at the nugget this band leaves its real fans everytime they throw in somethin extra cool. the cd comes with a 12 inch vinal with a extra song that isnt released on the website or the cd. with the other 4 songs on the flip side. its covered in geourgeous graphics. i would have paid way more than what i did for it. the packaging isnt given justice on the computer screen. im glad and proud to say this is my favorite band and as usual ill be seeing them every time they come to my home town till i get old and grey, then my grandchildren will still be pushing my wheelchair to see reverand billy!
0807014273|5.0|This book describes Frankl's experience in a concentration camp during WWII. I read it for a course I took.  I expected a self-help book, but what I got was a life changing work, one of the most inspiring books I've ever read.     This powerful book is a firsthand account from a Holocaust survivor about how even prisoners at Auschwitz could still find hope amidst the horrors within the walls of that concentration camp. The experience of those prisoners showed that even the deepest suffering can be turned into something positive.    The first half describes Frankl's experiences and observations of life in the camps from 1942-1945, like a Reader's Digest condensed version of Solzhenitsyn's \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch.\\"  But Frankl is also a psychiatrist, and his insights into the human behavior he saw are particularly interesting and detailed. He explains some of the coping mechanisms that people used and discusses why some defense mechanisms were more effective than others. Given the title, it's not surprising that the concept of \\"meaning\\" plays a key role.    The second half of the book is about how Frankl took the concepts he learned in the concentration camps and applied it to his work as a psychotherapist. Frankl's approach to psychotherapy is called Logotherapy. Logotherapy \\"confronts\\" patients to help them find, recognize, and reorient themselves toward the true, vital meaning of their own lives. Frankl talks about people living in an \\"existential vacuum\\" and proposes a technique or approach through which people can find meaning in work, love, or by responding in a healthy way to difficult circumstances.    The book is full of interesting ideas about human behavior and emotions. And of course, the historical context of Frankl's observations and insights makes them that much more powerful. One interesting idea is the concept of \\"paradoxical intention,\\" which implies that people frequently end up doing pretty much exactly the opposite of what they actually intended to do. That may help explain why people who go on a diet frequently end up gaining weight, why people who resolve to quit drinking frequently go back to the bottle, and similar, puzzling behaviors. Frankl describes a number of ways in which understanding the concept of paradoxical intention can help people overcome certain types of seemingly uncontrollable behavior problems.    But the key insight of course is the concept of \\"meaning,\\" the idea that it is up to each person to recognize that even if they lose everything, their family, their freedom, their rights, even their very identity, nevertheless there is still one thing that no one can take from them, and that is their ability to choose how to respond to adversity. People who realize that have an incredibly valuable tool for making sense of life, even in the most dire circumstances. The realization that there is a higher purpose, even amidst such circumstances, can be a powerful tool to help one find a way through adversity. That's an awesome thing.    This was a very inspirational book.  I recommend it to anyone, especially those who may be experiencing something of an \\"existential vacuum\\" in their own lives.

0812550706|5.0|Ten days ago, I'd never heard of Orson Scott Card, though the man has written at least forty novels, won several major prizes, and sold probably more copies of his books worldwide than I've played notes in my musical lifetime. \\"Ender's Game\\" seems to be his best-known and most continually popular novel. It's forthrightly sc-fi futurism, the story of a child genius, Ender Wiggin, the `product' of selective human breeding and or genetic engineering, who is identified, monitored, and raised to be the ultimate military strategist/gamesman to save the human species from the `buggers', aggressive aliens who resemble hiving insects, who have twice attempted to `colonize' Earth. The eugenic challenge for the trainers of such a savior, who have tried and failed repeatedly to get the genius they want, is to select a child with the intelligence and the instincys for combat yet also with the `empathy' to fathom the intentions of the aliens, who communicate by languageless telepathy. Ender and his two equally brilliant older sibs are in effect evolved &Uuml;bermenschen - supermen - in the distorted popular sense applied to the philosophy of Nietzsche. Mr. Card, a devout Mormon, plainly has struggled with the concepts of evolution in his life, rejecting both the standard Darwinian synthesis and the alternate notions of Intelligent Design, but (like it or not) \\"Ender's Game\\" is arguably more about the science of evolution than about the science of space exploration.<br /><br />Card is smart. Very smart, I suspect. Just now, I'm perhaps the only Homo sapiens on Earth who could take the guy down. (grin)  And why is that? Because I know what he knows, while he has no idea what I know. Well, honestly, I should say that I know what he KNEW 33 years ago, when Ender's game was published. So it all depends on his learning curve since then ....<br /><br />One thing he knew was ancient history. The novel is replete with historical allusions, some of them quite arcane. In other words, he's slyly pedantic; I like that in a pop novelist. The two Wiggin sibs adopt pen names of Demosthenes and Locke, names that resonate with the actions they commit. The Interstellar Foundation that grooms Ender to be commander of an intergalactic star fleet is a kind of American Sparta. Ender's childhood is the rearing of a space-age Spartan warrior. And the rulers of Earth are called the Hegemon and the Strategoi, good Greek to me.<br /><br />Another thing Card knows is \\"formulae.\\" Not chemical formulae. Literary. Ender's Game incorporates most of the formulae of `boy hero' tales from Parzifal to Harry Potter. In fact, Ender is patently Harry Potter in a Space Suit. The boy confronts the same dilemma, a unique Power that he must learn to wield for Good even though he has no idea of its source, or control of his training regimen, or certainty that hs Power is truly Good rather than Evil. And he's increasingly wary of the truth that he's being manipulated, that the `adults' know much which they are concealing from him. Ender goes off to Battle School just as Potter goes to Hogwarts. The same hostility and rivalry that confronts Potter at Hogwarts confronts Ender at Battle School. Even the ball games that Ender plays as part of his battle training are curiously similar to quidditch in the Potter novels. But A.K. Rowland has no grounds for accusing Card of plagiarism; Ender's Game was published in 1977!<br /><br />There isn't a lot of hard science in Ender's Game. The space travel and space weaponry are sketchily described at best. But Card is an astonishing futurist. Sci-fi writers have a grand tradition as visionaries -- think of Jules Verne's submarines or Carel Capek's robots -- but Orson Scott Card out-envisions the best:<br />1- He describes an internet based on computers that resembles our current world wide web in almost every detail.<br />2- He posits the development of interactive computer games as fantastical as any a boy of 2010 could wish for.<br />3- He gives Ender and the other children computerized \\"desks\\" that foretell our most powerful laptops and iPads, \\"desks\\" that the kids can take to bed and read under the covers as Abe Lincoln took borrowed books to read by candle-light. In fact, Card's computers are not just the apple; they're the whole apple tree.<br />But he missed horribly as a social prophet; in Ender's era, the Cold War remains unresolved, with a confrontation between the Warsaw Pact and the Americans still threatening.<br /><br />Nevertheless, as I said, I'm the dude who could take Card down. I'm sure of it, simply because I KNOW I could write a better ending for this book. Really, dear readers, the ending is a sump, a let-down, a lapse from sharply focused examination of ethical considerations in the futurist framework to a non sequitur narratively sloppy mysticism.<br /><br />I was enthralled until the ending, that I have to admit. And that's the basis for my five-star rating: entertainment value. In fact I lasted a half-hour longer on the exercycle while reading Ender's Game than I usually manage. But one is enough. I won't need to read the TEN sequels.that foretell our most powerful laptops and iPads, \\"desks\\" that the kids can take to bed and read under the covers as Abe Lincoln took borrowed books to read by candle-light.

B0041CGP02|5.0|For the true Bon Jovi fan, the Ultimate Collection is a \\"must have\\" for your music library.  The first CD has all the big hits and familiar songs that even the casual listener would enjoy.  These include \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\", \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\", \\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\", etc.  It also includes Jon Bon Jovi's #1 hit \\"Blaze of Glory\\" from the Young Guns II soundtrack.    The second CD is full of fan favorite songs, and I have to say that I enjoy listening to the second CD more than the first.  With songs such as \\"In These Arms\\", \\"Someday I'll Be Saturday Night\\", \\"These Days\\", \\"Make a Memory\\", \\"Keep the Faith\\", and more, you are taken on an emotional journey, full of love and hope.    There are four new songs (two on each disc), and I particularly like the new single, \\"What Do You Got?\\", as well as the clever tongue-in-cheek song, \\"The More Things Change\\".  All in all, the Ultimate Collection is a great buy.
1401227821|5.0|What makes a great \\"Art of...\\" book is when the artist gives behind the scenes happening's for each of his/her work. A good art of book is not just a book filled with there pieces. Who cares, you can find that on the net. No, a good book shows the pieces of the artist and he/she gives an explanation on why they created it and maybe even how. There have been some really interesting \\"behind the scenes\\" stories on how some of our favorite art pieces were created. Great art books that do this are Frazetta, Drew Struzan (top notch by the way) and this one by Adam Hughes.<br /><br />Its an easy read with fabulous art work. Not only is it a great coffee table type book but it's gold for the aspiring artist as well.
159102594X|5.0|I'm not a professional reviewer and although, I took English in college, it wasn't my major nor do I remember the finer points.  I read what I think I'll like and sadly that doesn't always work out.  That being said, I seriously loved this book!  Unbelievably well written, almost tangible, fight scenes. So much so that Abercrombie is definitely the new standard in my book.  Actually, I didn't even have a standard before this book, never really thought about it.  But the real hook was the characters, who were well-developed and complex and unlike many fantasy novels, very believable. I loved how the author's writing style and voice changed a bit with each of the main characters.  I found the book to be completely engrossing.  I could hardly put it down and when I did, couldn't wait to get back to it.  I just love it when that happens!      This book likely isn't for everyone as there is a lot of violence and torture.  And I normally don't deliberately choose books with blood on the cover, but in this case, I'm very glad I did.  Joe Abercrombie may be my new favorite writer, at least for now.  A few of my other current and historical favorites, so you can gauge whether or not you should believe my review:  Michael J. Sullivan, Ken Scholes, Scott Lynch, Sherri Tepper, Ursula LeGuin, Margaret Atwood, John Irving, Stephen King, Tolkien(duh).  Oh, and Patrick Rothfuss who is my other new favorite.
0316098337|1.0|Honestly, I was only able to read 37 pages of this book.  Despite glowing reviews, I found the style of writing (from the point of view of a 5 year old, in the first person) to be too precious and self conscious to be bearable.

0891419063|5.0|E.B. Sledge's Autobiography of his experiences in WWII is excellent. He takes you from boot camp to war's end and doesn't spare any of the horrid experiences he encountered along the way. There is no Hollywood point of views to be found anywhere in this great read. Just a man expressing the experiences he shared with his brothers and the bond that could not be broken, regardless of how horrible of a situation they found themselves. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys WWII history pieces.
B000B589JI|5.0|I ordered and received this item and although it's a great little item to have I am sure, no where in the product description did they mention this thing uses Liquid Lighter Fluid. They don't even say the word \\"Fluid\\"! They simply refer to it as fuel.  This item appeared when I did a search for \\"Butane\\" so I misunderstood and thought it used butane fuel.  Needless to say, this little guy is going back. I really hope they will change the description to note that it is for liquid fuel....  In a rush and should have read the reviews as even though they don't really mention fluid some do give the impression that is was for liquid fuel and not butane fuel.  I hope in time I'll find one that holds the butane so I can carry one to keep my lighter filled.<br /><br />P.S. - It's nice to see that since I wrote to them, the description now does say \\"Liquid\\". Only once, but it does mention it in the item description - it should also say it in the product name, but it's nice to see they listened and did update something.  = )
B0049D1TCM|5.0|If your going to by the album, you might as well get the deluxe edition. I did not buy the deluxe edition but this album definately leaves you wanting more tracks from Nicki Minaj. Most of the songs dont have as many verses from Nicki that there should be, so extra tracks will do the trick. This album will have no problem going GOLD. Good freshman start!
B000002C4J|4.0|I love Celine Dion, and I own just about every album she's released.  As far as vocals go, she is rarely topped.  Her musical journey though, is one of debate.  To knock her for what she does would be a mistake, because no one in the industry does it half as well as she does, but consistency is something that can be debated since her albums as a whole tend to offer pieces of magnificence wrapped around moments of forgettable mediocrity.  That is the issue with this musical genre, in that the artistic progression can be stilted by the confines of the genre.  The songs, while beautiful, age quickly and tend to sound similar.<br /><br />Still, I eat it up as do millions of others.<br /><br />I'll start by taking a minute to just address the elephant in the room, the one song that everyone and their mother knows and remembers and will never forget; `My Heart Will Go On'.  Honestly, I consider this one of the greatest love songs of ALL TIME.  Yes, many of my snobbish `self proclaimed critics' friends (aren't we all) consider this one of the most overpraised and overrated songs of all time, but I cannot shake it.  It continues to stir my heart and bring me back to that place all those years ago when I saw the film for the first time and fell in love.  Sure, it could be a certain bias thanks to my adoration of the film itself, but whatever.<br /><br />The song is beautiful.<br /><br />The title track, `Let's Talk About Love', is slightly bland.  I like the children's choiresque breakdown towards the end, but that is the only moment of color on the track and it is soon masked by the generic handling of the song itself.  It isn't bad, but it meanders on mediocre.<br /><br />Taking a look at the few collaborations here, Celine has mixed results.  The best is easily her duet with Luciano Pavarotti, a beautifully ballad that fuses his operatic roots with her shimmering vocals.  `Tell Him' works, but not as well.  I've never been one who was completely sold on Barbara Streisand as a singer.  I love her as an actress, but compared to Dion she kind of pales to me (the fuller quality of her voice gives her an aged voice, in my opinion).  The song is pretty, but slightly generic.  I just expected more from the pairing (despite my apparent bias).  To be completely frank, `Treat Her Like A Lady' was a total disaster.  I don't understand these singers thinking that they can take on a genre like Reggae or Latin fusion anything within that range and get away with it.  Celine, you are as white as they come and when you try so hard to be commercial and relevant you come off foolish.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE!<br /><br />Breaking down the rest of the album, the best tracks are easily `The Reason', `Why Oh Why', `Were Is the Love', `I Hate You Then I Love You' and `To Love You More'.  I can't find any validation for my claims here, but I swear that `Why Oh Why' is a duet with Toni Braxton, but I could be totally wrong (and I probably am).  It's a brilliant song either way.  `To Love You More' (one of the albums singles) is a beautifully constructed radio song; giving her a commercial edge while maintaining her signature contemporary quality.  `The Reason' was a stellar way to open the album, totally setting us up for what Celine was about to offer.<br /><br />There are a slew of good songs where with little to complain about (think `Love Is On the Way' and `Us') but they also don't really resonate for long periods of time.  Celine never sounds off, so we can't knock her for her vocals (they are always sublime), but those songs just don't `pop'.  `Immortality' could have easily been one of the best songs on the album, but I kind of hate the way they break down the songs title in the chorus; it's annoying (to me).<br /><br />`Just a Little Bit of Love', `Miles to Go (Before I Sleep)' and `When I Need You' can join the albums title track in that whole `rather bland and forgettable' department.<br /><br />In the end, this is Celine Dion,and when you have an artist this consistently debatable you kind of know that you are going to find her albums somewhat mixed.  Like I said, she never sound off, and so when you want to hear a beautiful voice you know you can reach for a Dion album and be completely satisfied.  She, honestly, has one of the best in the business, hands down (she's like the white Mariah Carey).  That said, as I mentioned, this album (and to a certain degree all of her albums) rest within her comfort zone (adult contemporary) and Celine is not one of those artists who can dwell comfortably outside of that niche (as can be seen on that atrocious `Treat Her Like A Lady', although that was just a dreadful choice in direction).  Still, she is marvelous and I love her and this album, no matter how collectively middlebrow, is one I am proud to own.ou are going to find her albums somewhat mixed.

B002KVSJ64|4.0|I want to be clear in that I really like Breaking Benjamin as a band and I actually really like all of their albums.  I know that is probably evident from the four star rating here.  The reason I want to be clear with that up front is because I don't have a lot of nice things to say regardless of my rating.  The fact remains that I have little to say about this album, which is never a very good thing.  I'm giving it a B because it is, from start to finish, a solid album and not one song is bad or distasteful.  The reason I have nothing to say is because, outside of four tracks, none of these songs really stand out from the rest.  In fact, none of these songs even sound distinctive of this present album.  That is my main issue with bands like Breaking Benjamin.  They sound the same from record to record.  There is no growth, and each song starts to run into the other in a fashion that strips them of any personality.  Yes, they are very good at what they do.  The vocals are great and the musical progression from song to song is catchy and very listenable, but when all is said and done there is nothing here that you will remember with a fondness that makes you anticipate their next offering with ecstatic excitement.  Their sophomore album still remains their pitch perfect highlight, and since then they have meandered within the narrow limits of their `comfort zone'.  Their mellow tempo ballads all sound the same, with a haunting down-tuned verse structure and then an immediate uplift with the chorus that sounds like the same beat structure from track to track.  Their heavier offerings consist of grungy arrangements and the signature growl here and there within the chorus.  They are just far too predictable.  They need to do more tracks like their acoustic take on `The Diary of Jane', for it gave them a layer of visionary personality.  Over time, while they maintain their obvious talent, they become slightly boring.<br /><br />Anyways, `Fade Away' is a brilliant opener, and their first single `I Will Not Bow', while slightly generic for them, is them at their best within their signature structure.  `Lights Out' is catchy, sure, but it also manages to sound like a different take for them (it reminds me of early Sevendust).  `Dear Agony' is the best ballad here, for it has a beautiful sullenness about it and the uplift in the chorus is swelling; moving.<br /><br />Sadly, the rest of the album, while perfectly solid, is nothing special.  I'm waiting for Breaking Benjamin to come out of this rut and present us with something that takes their obvious knack for musical construction and brings it to another level.  They have it in them, but they really have yet to deliver on their promise.<br /><br />I have faith in you!ir first single `I Will Not Bow', while slightly generic for them, is them at their best within their signature structure.  `Lights Out' is catchy, sure, but it also manages to sound like a different take for them (it reminds me of early Sevendust).  `Dear Agony' is the best ballad here, for it has a beautiful sullenness about it and the uplift in the chorus is swelling; moving.

If not, he sounds like an Irish man trying to sing like an American.  I appreciated the eclectness of the sounds - banjo, etc. but overall, more disappointed with the cross-sell recommendation and my lack of discipline to reject the initial recommendation - anyway - good luck to the band.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|Absolutely breathtaking, not so much the special effects, which display every penny spent on this film, but the incredibly involving and emotional life stories of Nemo.  It's a long film, so take care of any distractions and settle in, it demands close attention and involvement.  I can understand, to some extent, why it wasn't a commercial success in this country, no monsters or super heroes, but the lack of critical recognition is astounding, and speaks volumes about the vacuous nature of our film industry, top to bottom.  Don't miss it.

It reconfirmed what I thought: Don't ever bother reading critical reviews! (Having just listened to it once for the first time, I can't believe anyone could waist their energy writing anything less than a rave. A one star review? C'mon, that's some sort of joke... an infantile one too.)   It's simply perfect. Much love went into this. Annie's voice is as soothing and angelic as ever. Gorgeously arranged too. This is fully in keeping with the Christmas spirit even with the trademark Annie treatment. She makes them hers. I absolutely love the entire album, including the new Universal Child song. Whoever thinks her voice has \\"lost something\\" or that she is using \\"electronic trickery\\" to hit the notes cannot possibly be familiar with Annie's vocal ability. (Youtube her recent live performances if you need proof.)    Thank you Annie!   Love and Peace to all this season!

B001HN694K|1.0|Lame script, butchered original story, no plot, younger Alice so precocious I wanted to drop-kick her to the moon! Older Alice dull, dull, dull!!! And what was with the very stupid dance by her at the end? Johnny Depp copying copies of himself, basically chanelled Willie Wonka, sick of Helena Bonham Carter's pissed-off looks (would she HAVE a job is she wsn't shacking up with Burton???), major Carroll characters (Cheshire Cat, caterpillar) only doig walk-ons or walk-throughs, dark,dreary backgrounds, same CGI effects seen in every movie now ad nauseum. I fell asleep. Be sure to miss this one.    However, it had a killer Elfman score! That's the only nice thing I can think to say.
B0041YI4ZO|4.0|Ip Man 3, a prequel to the Ip Man, is more of a historical dramatisation, with less martial arts scenes than the other Ip Man movies. If you are interested in the story of Ip Man, it is great, but if you after the quality fight scenes, like that of Donnie Yen, then this is not what you are looking for.    Don't get me wrong, there are a a few worthwhile fight scenes.
0385523912|5.0|This book contains harrowing survival stories of North Korean defectors from the revolution until current day. It's the best non-fiction book I've read in 2010. I picked it up at an airport in Singapore and expected the worst. I soon found myself reading this book every chance I had, even if it meant losing sleep. It's amazingly well written and exciting to read. If you're a DPRKophile, this is THE book to read.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Obviously this is not like the popular series Band of Brothers but in a lot of ways that's a good thing. The war in the Pacific was of course no where near what it was like in the European theater and this series does it's best to make that distinction. It also sticks with the winning formula of interviewing those who where there and I particularly enjoyed the epilog bits where we get to see what happened to some of those depicted where they end up.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I'm a long time Groban fan, so I looked forward to the new CD. At first listen, I wasn't quite sure about it. This is not a \\"popera\\" album. It was different from the lush sound that I was used to, and my favorite songs have always been in Spanish, so I missed that. However, after 3 or 4 listens, I'm totally sold! The voice is more real, without the reverberation and big orchestration. The melodies didn't grab me right away, but the more I listen, the more I appreciate them. Now, many of them are stuck in my head, in a really good way. Even though I don't love every track, this may end up being my favorite album so far, based on the artistry, creative growth, and beauty of some of the melodies and lyrics.
B0002KVULG|4.0|I'm surprised this film isn't better known - it deserves more attention.    The film is very well-made, the performances, in particular Kate Nelligan and Frank Langella, are perfect, and it's a stunning film in every way.    I think this is what they were trying to do with Lugosi, but this film succeeds!  It just captures all the eroticism and excitement of the story.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|My main goal with purchasing this product was reducing the noise level put out by the previous fan on my desktop PC. This got the job done (down about 5 dB) but I have got to say, no where was size mentioned in other reviews. This unit is Huge, twice the size of the OEM fan+heatsink. The description of the unit is correct--it will fit almost all Intel and AMD motherboards. But the physical size, in concert with the fact that it stands with the fan perpendicular to the the case, combines to make an awkward situation. I really can't close the case door now. But at least it's quiet.
B0000AGWRX|4.0|Over all, a good purchase.  it arrived ahead of schedule and in the overall condition stated.  Is a relatively old DVD, so not quite mint with slight wear, but was sealed in package, had booklet, and the discs were not scratched and were in perfect order.
B001IAOEXU|3.0|I bought these after reading all the 5 and 4 star reviews for shooting and racing games and used them to play Modern Warfare 2 (FPS).  The triggers did help make it easier reach the L2 and R2 for using equipment and throwing grenades, but after using them for a couple hours, I felt they didn't really make a HUGE difference.  Being familiar with the button layout, I could throw and use just as fast without them as with them.    I can definitely see where these would be useful for people playing driving games since it gives you much better gradient control over how hard you press the button, but in MW2 it's not really useful since most uses of L2 and R2 are tap and not hold based.    The triggers are made well, snap on cleanly to the remote control and stay on.  At $5 I will probably be keeping them
0812976525|5.0|I picked up this book to read for my short flight to Miami from NY.  I was so engrossed in it that when we landed, I didn't want to get off the plane but continue reading!  Originally published 16 years ago, I never felt it was dated reading it today.  Funny, witty and absolutely a joy to read, this is the BEST satirical novel I have ever read!  The book is only 272 pages, so it's very easy to digest.  I also loved the movie, but I loved the book even more.  I am now a Christopher Buckley fan!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Everyone makes mistakes.<br /><br />Therein lies the basic message behind Eminem's triumphant return to the rap game, Recovery. Even judging solely on the cover it's obvious you're going to hear some emotionally intense music...which you do.<br /><br />This is the CD Relapse should have been. Keep in mind, though, that I actually really enjoyed Relapse. I just felt like the entire CD was a joke, what with all the accents and serial killer rhymes. What I wanted were more tracks like Beautiful, where there's a genuine point to them. There is no shortage of that with Recovery. Every song has meaning and emotion behind it. Throw in the fact that Em has never sounded more focused, angry, and phenominal and there's no way you can't give credit to the man. One listen to his lead off single, Not Afraid, should've solidified the fact that Em is, at this point, the face of rap music. As well he should be.<br /><br />Looking at the songs, there's a lot of variety. You've got your explanatory tracks, You're Never Over, Not Afraid, Going Through Changes, and Talkin' 2 Myself. There's the upbeat, pointed tracks, Cold Wind Blows, On Fire, So Bad, and W.T.P. Then you've got the other amazing tracks like Cinderella Man, Untitled, Almost Famous, Love The Way You Lie, 25 To Life, and Spacebound. There are a couple missteps though, I didn't, and still can't, get into Won't Back Down or Seduction. Not a bad ratio at all if you ask me.<br /><br />I've made it obvious, I absolutely love this CD. I've pimped it to all my friends (\\"You HAVE to hear this\\"), have had some pretty deep conversations about certain songs, and have all around about damn near ruined my copy from continuous play. However, there are true standouts. The chill inducing goodbye letter to the rap game, 25 to Life, can speak to people on several different levels. Talkin' 2 Myself is the apology every fan wanted, basically explaining everything that's went wrong and why he's been gone. Cinderella Man is the anthem of the CD with a pounding baseline, intense rhymes, and a strong chorus. You're Never Over, while not a personal favorite, is lyrically probably the most heartfelt track included, proving itself to be a deserving goodbye to the hugely talented Proof. Past that, each song has immense depth (moreso than any rap album I've heard in a long time) so Recovery does deserve to be listened to in its entirety.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Cold Wind Blows, Talkin' 2 Myself, 25 to Life, Cinderella Man, and Spacebound. As high as my expectations were for Recovery pre-release Eminem somehow managed to take every expectation and completely destroy them. Best rap CD of the year? Definitely. Best CD of the year? Probably. Highly recommended.nse rhymes, and a strong chorus.

0141439734|5.0|\\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" remains one of the world's great classic tales of terror. Against the fogbound, menacing backdrop of Robert Louis Stevenson's London, the \\"strange case\\" of the respectable middle-aged physician Henry Jekyll, and his puzzling link with the menacing young Edward Hyde, unfolds through two key informants, both long-time friends of Jekyll. The first, the lawyer Utterson, prides himself on his laissez-faire attitude toward human frailty, and yet cannot bear it that Jekyll has inexplicably willed all his possessions to Hyde. The second, Dr. Lanyon, has cut ties with Jekyll on account of Jekyll's \\"fanciful\\" theories. The lawyer and the physician bring their respective areas of expertise to their investigation of the \\"strange case,\\" until separately they arrive at the hideous truth of Jekyll's secret. In spite of all the movies, the parodies, the TV ads, the media's facile \\"Jekyll/Hyde\\" references to every famous person who is revealed to be living a double life, the original story retains every bit of its power to surprise and terrify, and to make us ponder the mysteries of human identity.  This Penguin Classics edition also contains \\"The Body Snatcher\\" (a based-on-fact story of corpse-stealing for medical study, beautifully filmed by Val Lewton in 1945, with one of Boris Karloff's greatest performances) and \\"Olalla,\\" a haunting story of psychological as opposed to literal vampirism.
0316066524|3.0|Either you hate the book or love it; though I think love is a bit overgenerous.  Infinite Jest has small clearings of brilliant prose lost in a mired forest of obscurity, a loosely bound tangle of stories.  Wallace is clever but overindulgent. It is not a simple feat to write five to ten brilliant pages that somehow make the next banal hundred pages almost worth reading.  Wallace's descriptions of addiction - and not just substance addiction, is perceptive though a bit heavy-handed.  What makes this book \\"worth\\" reading is that it was not trimmed or boiled down by some editor attempting to pack it into a neat category in order to maximize sales, but the reason this book is not a \\"masterpiece\\" is because he did not have a good editor to both restrain him from \\"typing\\" and tighten the narrative.  Infinite Jest is a lot like Proust's \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" Vol. (n+1) which is better to know about then to read; therefore, I do not recommend it to someone lightly.  Despite my \\"warm\\" opinion of Infinite Jest, it is worth the read; just take your time and savor the brief clearings and skim the rest.  I am still working through the end of the book, though not in any hurry since there is no end; the pages just run out.  Be wary of anyone who considers this their favorite book; most likely they are affecting cheap superiority or ought to read more - friends don't let friends be pretentious!
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I always love Norah Jones but I would have liked to hear more of her and less of others. I can appreciate a duet but I don't want it to be the whole albumn. I think this showcased her large range and that is fabulous. Overall I think it is still a good albumn to add to your collection!
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I really like this CD. I am not a Kanye West fan. In fact, I have never heard any of his music before. My 18 year old son, whose taste in music I respect, was looking  forward to the release of this album, and I never knew he was a Kanye West fan either. He left a copy in my car, and I have been listening to nothing else for the past two days. It gets under your skin, and I find myself humming it, and craving to listen to it again. I have heard Jay Z on some interview on some late night talk show say that Kanye is a \\"genius.\\" I thought it was all hype. Especially after the Taylor Swift thing. He just seemed ridiculous. Guess I changed my mind, and I guess, after all the hype, what really matters is can this man create music that I wanna listen to and crave? Good job, Kanye. I like this, and I want to hear more. You just gained a fan.

The first few chapters of it are worth taking the time to capture into a 1-2 page cheat sheet that can be reviewed quickly before going into a strategy session.

B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I loved this cd \\"Double Fantasy Stripped\\".  It brought out John's fantastic voice more so than the original Double Fantasy.  Yoko's songs on the cd and terrific too and it showed how much she had grown in rock artistic styling. John always had THE best voice in rock, in my opinion, even though he never thought much of it.  This is a great album but its bittersweet that its the last from this extraordinary genius.

031603438X|4.0|I'm about half way through this book, and I'm enjoying it very much.  Keith is a true original in his way of speaking and being very honest about his rock past with drugs, women etc.  He is a great guitarist and delves very deeply into some of the songs and the chords and structures used on each.  If you are a guitarist, you would really love this book and his comments about his styling as well as some of his heroes like Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry ande many Chicago Blues artists.  The book is very interesting and I find it amazing how articulate and how much he remembers (or has his friends comment if he doesn't recall) his life.  Way to go, Keith.  Keith is the true feeling and essence of what the Stones are and were.
031603438X|5.0|I loved this book.  It is a great read fro musicians and non musicians alike.  The Stones are probably the best rock band of all time, and Keith has not only written great songs, but he has ahcnged guitar playing forever with his imaginative tuning sand guitar riffs.  Get this book.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I am 19 years old and have followed, like many my age, all the Toy Story movies. While I love it and let my son watch it, IT IS NOT ADVISED FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. The kids won't get the various themes so watching it won't hurt them, but this is a slightly different approach than the other Toy Story's have taken. It is more emotional, a tad more violent, and a small amount of gang-like activity.     (I love this movie but my sisters won't let their kids watch it for all the reasons I listed above. If you are worried about your kids mimicking this behavior, maybe this is not the movie for you)

B000FC2FVA|3.0|I went to the store to get the most recent CD by Phoenix (The Mozart one) because what I heard on the radio was pretty good! I hadn't heard any earlier Phoenix music at that time. This (It's never been like that) was the only CD by Phoenix the store had (released in 2006). I have been listening to it for a few days and can say, it's definately not the same as what is being played now on the radio. It's not a bad CD but it's not what you would expect if you are just getting into them in 2010. Just be prepared if you purchase it. Take the time to listen to samples before buying. You may like it and may not.<br />I felt the CD had a slow start. I'm not that interested in the first 2-3 songs. I frequently fwd past them. The next few songs are somewhat catchy but in my opinion are nothing to rave about. This CD feels like they were still finding out what they wanted to be.<br />I give the \\"band\\" 3-4 stars and this particular CD 3.
0062020897|5.0|Brilliant, astonishing, I would not let myself take a break from it.<br />It is fun, clever, the best novel I have ever written and possible the best novel this author has produced.<br />(A very respectable author)<br />Highly highly recommend this book.<br />As I sit here I cannot think of the words to describe how exhilarating it was to read this book.
B00408MS5S|5.0|This is a 5 star edition without question, previous reviews have pretty much covered everything that you need to know,but i disagree about wanting the band to vary the arrangements or tempo to any of the songs to make it different during live performances? I am very happy Supertramp always stayed true to the originals during their concerts.Buy this cd especially for cd 2,it is just amazing!! Roll on Crime in 2011.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I've seen this movie three times in the theater and left feeling energized every time!!!  Pure entertainment!  The kind of movie that you can see repeatedly and love more each time.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|Honestly, I didn't care for this movie. Reviews have often been positive. A bit too positive, I think. For me, this movie was more than a bit of a mess the entire way through.<br /><br />I mean, I get what they were TRYING to do. For me, it just fell completely flat.<br /><br />The basic premise is something of a comedy of errors mixed with a love story and told through song and dance. But it just never seemed to gel, for me.<br /><br />For one thing, the musical numbers were a mish-mash of little snippets of other musical numbers from musicals, popular/rock music (Queen, Madonna, etc., etc.)... Whether that's terribly original or not, I don't know. I mean, I myself have occasionally fancied doing the same thing: mashing up related lyrics from different songs to create a new story. (Eg. Jamie is Crying + It's My Party and I'll Cry if I Want To + Jamie's Got a Gun.) I mean, I can see the attraction of such mashups.<br /><br />Again, for me, it just didn't work. I wanted to like it. It was colorful, if nothing else. It wanted to be 'expansive' and bold, but, I don't know, at the same time it felt somehow claustrophobic and too Gilliam-esque (not unlike [[ASIN:B0011E5M66 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]) with all the tight-in close-ups and awkward scenes, and not-quite-right makeup and wigs designed to throw the viewer slightly off kilter.
0525423273|5.0|I read lots and lots of YA books but this one is really special, one of my favorites, because it has fun natural and fluid dialogues with interesting relatable characters with great chemestry.    It was a refreshing read and I´m really looking forward to other books of this author.    It really deserves to be a hit and it probably will because I´m sure there are a lot of other readers like me that were missing characters more like ourselves.    There were parts where I laughed out loud and there were parts that were really sweet and romantic. A perfect mix, really.    (sorry for my English mistakes)
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I would like to state here that I am 24 years old, female, and I love writing and reading other literary works. I have been an avid fantasy and sci-fi book reader since I can remember actually starting to read in the first place.     The Alchemyst is a very good book in my opinion. I picked up this book on a whim - I didn't actually expect to read this series past the first book, but I have been hooked and am currently on The Necromancer. I knew this was a YA book from the get-go, but the fact of the matter is that this book does NOT read like a young adult novel. The amount of detail that goes into the descriptions in this novel is not only thrillingly palatable, but it keeps you thinking about what is going to happen next. The conclusion of this story is still unclear, and I find that fact makes this series THAT much better - a predictable story ends up boring, and an unpredictable story makes me continue to buy the series.    If you enjoy Terry Brooks' Shannara/Knight of the Word/King of Landover series, Orson Scott Card's Sci-fi and fantasy (Ender's Game, The Enchantment), Harry Potter, The Da Vinci Code, anything by Katherine Neville (The Fire, The Eight), and Dave Duncan (The Knight's Blades series), you will probably enjoy this book. Michael Scott does an amazing job of weaving together mythological creatures/items with modern technologies and settings, putting together a story that is incredibly engaging.    The only bad aspect of this novel and series is the characters. The lack of characterization in certain respects can probably put off a lot of readers - if you are looking for a story that has characters like Twilight/Shiver (their characterization amplified by the romantic theme of the story), you will find this story sorely lacking. While the characters are NOT cardboard cutouts, their personalities and histories are not endlessly filled in with details supplied by the story. A reader will have to look hard to figure out who Josh, Sophie, and the Flamels are underneath all of the things that are happening in the story.    However, I would like to say this - if you understand that things are happening too quickly in the novel for ANY character to be properly fleshed out in ~300 pages, then you will enjoy this story for what it is, and you will get to know each and every person in time. This series requires patience in that regard, but that patience pays off - guaranteed.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Watched it last night and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. But it wasn't until I looked at the special features and saw that the commentary option had been made into its own musical that I began to appreciate how brilliant the creators of this little gem are. I immediately re-watched it with the musical commentary and enjoyed it even more than the first time round. The commentary songs are brilliant and funny (especially 'better than Neil' and 'nobody's Asian in the movies'). Enough from me. Just buy it and watch it, and then re-watch it with the singing commentary.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Most people have seen CCBB so this review is mostly about the quality of the remastered Blu-ray. This cut is far better then most new movies that are released on Blu-ray. They did it right. The opening scene of the different grand prix races I give a 9 out of 10 only because it was meant to look old because it is the history of where CCBB came from. Once the story starts after the opening credits/races I was blown away at the clarity and detail. This is a most own.  Of course the movie and music is fun and entertaining as well. I watched this movie with a group of friends. There was a teenager that was not thrilled about watching a musical, but I was told she sang the songs in the car ride home. Personnally I think if there were more movies like this, we would have less problems in this world.     -Enjoy Life,  -Jim

B003NHRIVQ|1.0|This movie was TERRIBLE. I can't believe it ranks in at a 4/5. If I could give it zero stars I would. Miley's acting is at an all time low. She is totally unrealistic as a brooding rebellious teenager. The acting by newcomer Liam Hemsworth is ever worse. But even the best of actors couldn't have saved this movie because the writing was God awful. It's hard to believe this is coming from the guy who wrote The Notebook and A Walk to Remember. He seems to have gotten lazy and been thinking more about popping out movies and racking in the dough. I rented this movie for a DOLLAR and still felt like I was ripped off. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Some folks have complained about Annie's voice in some of the songs and there has been some sparring back and forth. If vocal imperfections on an album grate you the wrong way (especially with Christmas songs) do listen to the samples first. They will give you a little taste to help you decide.     Here is my opinion to be added to the 50+ that precede mine. I love this album, for all the reasons that others have balked. There are vocal imperfections and her voice does strain in some selections, but let me tell you something, it didn't matter to me:     Annie Lennox is riveting.     Each and every word is clear. She socks them to you.    Even songs I've heard a thousand times before \\"pop\\". Silent Night is one of them. How many times in Mass have we sung the refrain, \\"Christ the Savior is born, Christ the Savior is born!\\" and actually thought about what we were singing?     When I heard Annie sing this refrain for the first time it stopped me in my tracks. For the first time in 30 years I THOUGHT about those words. I asked myself what they meant to me. It was powerful. It's almost as if Annie is challenging the hearer to actually think about what they are singing and to ask themselves what the words mean to them personally.     I don't think she's telling us what conclusion to draw, but pushing the fact that we need to dig a little deeper into our souls this Christmas. Especially if we do believe Christ the Savior was born those long years ago. How is it affecting our lives, our priorities, and our interactions with others?    If you want an album that gives you a warm fuzzy feeling, I guess this wouldn't be the one for you. But if you are okay with being pushed out of your Christmas comfort zone in such a way that you actually stop to ponder what we're singing about and how it relates to your life, this is awesome.    That said I won't be playing this during the Christmas meal, unless I want the conversation to focus on our opinions of the album. I will be playing it when I want to take a respite from the consumer driven freneticism of the season and actually think about the words.

B000050HTO|4.0|Bob Dylan might be said to be the musical equivalent of W.C. Fields. They are so fascinating, you can't stop watching them (or listening to him, in Dylan's case) -- yet you might not really know why.<br /><br />Was W.C. Fields easy on the eyes? No. Did he seem like somebody you might want as your next-door neighbor? Not especially. Was he outrageosly hilarious? I don't think so; but there was some quality about him that keeps your eyes glued to him when you watch one of his movies.<br /><br />Dylan is similar to me: Is he a great musician? No -- all his harmonica \\"solos\\" sound pretty much the same, for example. Does he seem like the kind of guy you'd want as your best buddy? Not necessarily -- he seems a little aloof and self-absorbed to me. Is he a great singer? Hardly. Sometimes you wonder if when he's singing he's making fun of somebody else (Woody Guthrie?) or he's putting everybody on with this vocal style. And yet ... there's something sort of addictive about it all.<br /><br />His vocal phrasing and timing are amazing - maybe that's one of the things that makes him so fascinating - he keeps you on your toes that way, constantly changing up the time value of the notes and his intonation.<br /><br />Anyway, Mr. Bob IS a great songwriter, and that's so obvious that it's barely an opinion, but practically an established fact; as proof just take a look at a small subset of the artists who have covered his songs:<br />Johnny Cash<br />Eric Clapton<br />Sam Cooke<br />Flatt & Scruggs<br />Green Day<br />Burl Ives<br />Wyclef Jean<br />B.B.

0061922315|4.0|Excellent plot about both sides of the story of the adoption of a baby girl from India by a couple in America. Character development was sketchy, though - I didn't get much sense of each character as an individual and they weren't well-rounded; each filled their role in the story but didn't come alive much beyond that. The story moves quickly through a lot of time in little vignettes, which may have made it harder for the author to develop her characters fully - still, a moving novel about international adoption, worth reading.
0375842209|5.0|Having death tell its story is a unique perspective that makes this book so addicting and amazing. I wouldn't say grade 9 for an average 9th grader it may be too much I would say 11th grade is when they would be old enough to really appreciate it. I am in my 20s and this book was recommended to me as a vacation read. I sat at the beach all day and read, I was addicted, I could not put it down. It is a smooth read but it touches you do deeply it feels like you are reading an adult novel. This book is worth the time and money. You will never want to put it down and the story will make you reflect on your own life in a way that the book becomes a part of you.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|\\"Modern Family\\" is all it's been cracked up to be ... and more.  Each week, the three families in this docu-comedy deliver some of the most inspired moments in comedy television since other classics like \\"Soap\\", \\"Bernie Mac\\" or \\"The Simpsons.\\"  Irreverent, intelligent and often side-splitting, the ensemble cast is brilliant, from the startling hysterical kids to the never-better Ed O'Neill.      The amazing Ty Burrell is unforgettable as Phil Dunphy (check him out hosting the annual Real Estate Awards Ceremony for sheer genius).  Jessie Tyler Ferguson as Mitchell - half the gay couple - continues to grow on me week after week (his frightful head trip with a pigeon had me in stitches), as he confronts the utterly inane and made-in-comedy-heaven antics of his partner Cam.  Sofia Vergara is drop-dead stunning as Gloria, a no-nonsense Latina traditionalist in a bombshell body, voluptuous yet vulnerable, sensitive and totally unaware of her beauty and sex appeal.  The broad caricature required of her character is offset with a delicious delivery that's less stereotype and more human.  And her mispronunciations are heaven-sent comedy one-liners that inevitably make me dissolve into a fit of hysterical giggles.  When someone \\"scares the bejessus out of her\\", it's the Baby Jesus they're messing with!  And as a witch on Halloween, Vergara shines in what may be an Emmy performance!    Eric Stonestreet's Cam was the breakout star of the 1st season winning an Emmy as Best Supporting Actor right out of the gate.  And while everyone in this delightful cast deserves to be lauded - and all of them will eventually I suspect - Stonestreet matches Vergara in nailing his lines with the lived-in comfort of an overweight insecure and nelly middle aged man.  He's a bundle of nervous energy - part Mork (the eternally great Robin Williams), part Jodie (Billy Crystal's ground-breaking character in \\"Soap\\"), yet ALL Cameron!  Stonestreet puts the force in \\"tour-de-force\\" with a grab-you-by-the-nuts conviction and utterly bizarre loopiness that's endearing and HYSTERICAL.      Burrell, Vergara, Ferguson, and O'Neill have moments of pure comedy perfection in the ensemble.  But the rest of the cast is uniformly top-notch.      Julie Bowen as Clare - Phil's wife - is sharp as a tack, all drive and energy and focus, despite the inevitable stupidity that she deals with in the warped and utterly relatable family she's surrounded by.  The voice of reason for the Dunpheys, she's daddy's little girl, Phil's muse and comic joy-buster, Mitchell's rival and Cam's conscience.  She's also a mom juggling a crass and uncensored son, Luke (a truly 3-D boy-joy of a kid - a first in television in my opinion) and two teenage daughters - polar opposites with age-appropriate self-esteem issues that go hand in hand with growing up.  All are fantastic.  And, finally, there's Rico Rodriguez as Manny, Gloria's older-and-wiser-than-he has a right to be son...is the perfect tonic to O'Neill's gin, infused with both his mom's gumption and guts and the wisdom he inherits from the adults that inhabit his cul-de-sac.  He's a rich character who may be worthy of a spin-off as a genius 15 year old in college.  Rodriguez - like the rest of this inspired cast nails his lines like nobody's business.  Kudos to the writers and casting team, those unsung geniuses to whom we owe this weekly vacation-of-the-giggles!    Together, these families reflect our schools, homes, little league games and neighborhoods.  \\"Modern Family\\" is a brave, passionate and heartfelt portrait of family life so rarely seen on screen today.  It's also familiar, and relatable in a way that actually makes you think (for a change, especially when it comes to family \\"sitcoms\\").  And if you don't think it can get any better, it happens to be a miraculous joyous and hopeful comedy filled with foibles and funny moments galore, vivid characters in familiar situations and belly-clenching guffaws that often require a second viewing!      This is comedy at its best - and the reason some of us still watch Network TV.  If you haven't given it a shot, set the DVR (please!), settle back in a comfy chair whenever you need a good laugh....and enjoy.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|Not as great as season 1. After season 1 I had great expectations for the second season. Glenn Close is amazing but I feel as though there was too much going on to focus on her acting. Nonetheless if you are looking for a great show to watch about women lawyers in the field it is great.
B003L20ICE|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" other than sublime performances from three of my favorite actors today - Annette Bening, Julianne Moore and Mark Rufalo.  Whatever I was expecting did not compare to what the film delivered - in spades.  In short, TKAAR is a testament to the true - and new - meaning of family and a postcard of hope to the millions of non-traditional families who comprise our new reality.  I liken the film to 1980's Best Picture, Ordinary People, which captured effortlessly the family dynamic of the time with brutal honesty and raw emotion.  Watching \\"Kids\\" was partly a lesson in how far we've come as a society as well as how far we still need to travel to accept the fact that families come in new flavors (a same-sex couple here - deliciously played by Bening and Moore) as well as thru the miracle of science (a sperm donor, absent for a lifetime but suddenly available and real to his offspring).    While the subject matter may be distasteful to some, what I found especially touching about the film's characters and themes was how incredibly NORMAL and REAL these people were.  The two moms (referenced repeatedly by the two teenagers in this quintet in the singular) are our neighbors, daughters, sisters, friends, and co-workers.  We ride the subway with them, share the car pools and accept - at least on a surface level - the reality of their choices, without judgment or fear.  Bening and Moore deliver stunning portrayals as the lesbian couple - they share a lived-in comfort and rapport that's familiar...like our own parents, and our own relationships - gay, straight or otherwise.  Their home is lived in and relaxed.  The battle the same demons most of us can relate to (that 3rd glass of wine some nights after crazy-busy days...or the longing a housewife feels for what she might have missed, the second-guessing of choices that are inevitable in any long term relationship.    But for me, what brings the film together, in the end -and after much frustration as the story ebbs and flows - is Mark Buffalo as the long-forgotten - and rarely discussed man - who donated the fruit of his testes for money in college.  His life is upended as his connection with these two women and the children he spawned flows effortlessly, and his immediate sensual connection to Moore's character brings his new-found sensibilities to a bitter, life-altering crash.  Buffalo works wonders with a role that relies on his stiff-upper-lip attitude and facial emotions.  We see his evolution throughout the film, from when his stranger-children resurface and he's thrown unmercilesly under a microscope, finding himself unsure of who he is or why.  He's both at peace with his playboy life but also yearns to know all that he's missed, accept what's left to learn, and embrace all that he's yearned for but never understood.  As his world crashes around him and the \\"moms'\\" deal with real-life issues every couple can relate to - questions of character, morality, resentments and \\"what might have been\\" - the film transcends the formula and becomes an intense study in family.  The ties that bind are often fraught with doubt...and some are simply ripped away by complacency, resentment and the realities of what we give up to be who we ultimately become.    The way Buffalo comes full circle here is a tour-de-force, his best effort yet.  Unassuming, yet so full of himself so as to risk everything to keep reality from intruding on his world.  Julianne Moore is radiant - as always.  I wish she were being submitted in the Supporting Actress category instead of Best Actress since she'd be a lock to finally win a well-deserved Oscar (she should have won for \\"Far from Heaven\\").      But ultimately - \\"Kids\\" is a classic character study of the definition of family, of dads, sisters, brothers and moms.  Like Mary Tyler Moore's hateful mother-dearest in \\"Ordinary People\\" - Bening's no-holds-barred laser-focused and proud mom is one for the ages.  Here, she's gifted and sarcastic, staunch and direct, loving, grateful, pragmatic but very much in love.  Her interactions with her lover are casual, expected and tender - never exploitive to the viewer, but understood.  These women have the lived-in quality of most long term couples I know - straight and gay.  They're worn, but loving, celebrating and embracing the life they've created in the face of society's ongoing ignorance and distaste for gay families.  Bening KNOWS it's not an easy life choice, but her spirit and deep sincere love shines thru even when the sharp, cruel edges of her character startle us. She's the tough mom, the bread-maker, the one who went for the dream (at another's expense), and made a home with the woman of her dreams.  Bening is stunning - real, authentic and sympathetic - both in her spoken dialogue and in quiet unexpected shots of her amazing etch-a-sketch face which deliberately shows exactly what she's feeling, hearing, questioning, accepting, discovering and learning.  It's a wonderful face, and a terrifyingly familiar character to anyone in a long-term relationship who has ever wondered \\"what if I wasn't with this person...who would I be?\\"  While Moore's character ultimately experiences this specific collision of fate and doubt on screen, it is Bening who ultimately conveys the layers and textures of a proud woman, torn by reconciling the illusion of love with the consequences of living the lives we choose.  Bening is over-due for Oscar love even though the competition this year will rival her two prior losses to Hilary Swank given the buzz for Natalie Portman in \\"Black Swan\\".  In my mind, Bening's singular performance in \\"American Beauty\\" already puts her among the top 1% of our best actors, while \\"Bugsy\\", \\"Grifters\\" and \\"Running with Scissors\\" remind us of her range - and the rage she taps into from the gut.  Only \\"American Beauty\\" comes close to her performance in \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" - and she deserves to be recognized and celebrated for her brilliant, no-holds-barred performance.     \\"The Kids are Alright\\" deserves to be widely seen by ANY couple in a long-term relationship, and especially career-couples with kids.  The themes here are universal, despite the somewhat rare and obscure circumstances of the plot.  It does help to remember that today, unconventional families -both traditional AND piecemeal - live on our block, or just down the street.  Our kids play with their kids; the adults engage - or not - just as we do...we share dentists, playgrounds and car pools.  And, in the end, even if we don't always see eye to eye (what neighbors do?) - we all want, crave and deserve the same thing ... to be happy, to have love, and to make a better future for our kids.  \\"The Kids are Alright\\" is accessible, yet distant and obscure, but ultimately illuminating, with career-defining roles from Annette Bening and Mark Ruffalo.  A rare, beautifully rendered film about family that shatters myths and inspires self-reflection.
B004AQR29C|1.0|Leftover crap from the 80's.  I loved the action movies of Arnold and Bruce Willis from the 80's.  In this flick, Stallone is so pumped full of botox that his face doesn't even move.  Please go elsewhere for mindless entertainment!
B004B4J7H8|5.0|Okay so I didn't buy this soundtrack from Amazon, but seeing this price i really wish i had. The price for this album on iTunes is just absolutely ridiculous even it was the Special Edition (plus 3 bonus tracks and a small documentary)... iTunes= 13.99 Amazon= 4.99 C'mon, there's no arguing.     Now for the actual review and stuff...    The music is absolutely amazing!! I have had it on repeat on my iPod for 4 days non-stop... It's very exciting and very chill all at the same time. The twist on the music style is very nice too.. I especially like the jazzy flute in \\"Lovegood\\". Alexandre Desplat's music brings the movie to a whole new level. He brought a richness and warmness that i hadn't experienced with the previous composers. The music has a wide range of \\"bright\\" and \\"dark\\" feelings that can only be experienced through the music.     However, I really would have liked to hear the main theme a lot more(Hedwig's Theme) than 2 little glimpses of it in The Will and Farewell to Dobby..      Now, if you're a person of tradition and don't really like change or variation of something, this might not be for you. This album is very different than the first 6.     All in all a 5/5. Great music, texture, very stylistic and a change from the norm. :)
0316069906|4.0|Eating Animals is an excellent book for those who are curious about our food system and it's sustainability. Foer presents a solid condemnation of factory farms from a moral and environmental perspective.    Foer appeals to a moral sensibility throughout the entire book, which I felt uncompelled by. However, he never points out that even vegetarianism can support animal cruelty and even factory farming, through the purchase of eggs and dairy products.    I find this particularly frustrating because throughout the book Foer weighs the attrocities of factory farming with the reader's desire to eat meat. Meat is easy to see, and easy to refuse. There are usually obvious vegetarian options available, but what about butter, milk or eggs. In most cases, animals had to suffer to produce those too, but Foer never once assesses the difficulties of being vegan. It's not easy to know whether something has been cooked with dairy. It's not obvious, and that makes dining with others hugely difficult.     The other reason this ommission infuriates me is that Foer acts as though, by being vegetarian, he has spared himself any moral responsibility for animal cruelty.    Other than that, this book is great. It's a fast read and very informative. I highly recommend it.

It has three levels of difficulty, Jillian talks you through the whole process and it is done within 30 minutes!!

0765326353|5.0|You can see his experience in writing grow in this book.  What I've liked about his books from an overall perspective is he never starts with ye ole, young boy on the farm and his slow ascension into his destiny, how the reader usually learns at the main characters pace.  Sanderson gives us allot of meat from the start, plenty of mature main characters in critical places, so we get a sense of the world early on and not in bits and pieces. He also has great characters you can connect with from the start, allot of flaws clearly visible and relatable, very likeable, sort of anchors for the learning phase of the book, aka Kelsier, Raoden, Dalanar.   Among these mature characters there are some that do grow from naivety to greatness, it's a great mix to make the start of a series feel established, yet with plenty of room to mature.  Reading that this world would be a bit different and feel more alien had me a bit worried at first that it would go to Sci-Fi, I don't like mixing those genres much, but it's far from Sci-Fi, truly refreshing, it feels interesting and \\"magical\\" without the feeling of an over used old world fantasy.       I'm only sad to realize it will take a decade or more to listen to it all, and for the moment that I am approaching the end of this one.
B003UBTX7C|1.0|As a Baldacci fan I think I can honestly declare that this book is awful. The only thing I regret more than the money and time I wasted on this book is the knowledge that an author whose past work I've enjoyed so much would allow such a bogged down, convoluted, impossibly far-fetched tale be published. What a complete lack of regard for those of us who have faithfully read and anticipated his work.  I will be very cautious about picking up any of his future novels and can only hope that the author either regains his talent or let's his conscience keep him from swindling his fans. Much more work like this will only diminish his reputation.
B0000929VJ|4.0|I love hard rock 'n roll, but something about their music preview really made me want to buy it.  And I'm glad I did.  Not a bad song on it.  The only problem I have is that I hadn't heard it before.  A CD for any collection.
B001UV4XX8|3.0|This is a good creepy b movie, it's not a great movie but a decent b movie with a list actors in it. The premise is interesting and I think alot of people hate this because they'd push the button to get the million bucks. lol.  If you push it someone dies. I wouldn't unless it was a gangsta rapper just so that I wouldn't have to hear their music again. Ok, I am kidding but this is only a movie after all, the premise is silly in a way but who cares? it's intriguing and creepy and that's good enough for me, The blu ray looks pretty good too.
B004132HZS|5.0|In the past decade, when the newest master actor to play Sherlock died, I felt like I had lost an entertainer, an escape, a deliciously eccentric adult playmate, and a comic genius all in one. I never wanted to hear the name Sherlock Holmes again. Jeremy was Holmes. Period. And no one in my lifetime would ever match him.     But I have to say that this new series is such a fantastic recreation of these characters, that it is fresh, delightful, playful, amusing, and fascinating.     They have resurrected a character and his Watson in a manner that is NO copy, but preserves the eccentric lovable features of my past prized actor, and they have made a fully new presentation, with the spice of a youthful smart cast that is a marvel.     These actors and stories are all top quality, and if this is the only season, someone is on drugs. These stories and characters are perfect with long staying power, and will be as prized in 15 years as today.     Wonderful. Joyous. Immense fun. Superior stories and characters.     BRAVO!
B0032KNA4I|5.0|On blu ray this looks as good as it did at the theater. It's not supposed to deep filmmaking , instead it's a thrill ride of complete disaster. It's over the top and exciting and that's good enough. If you analyze films like these too deeply then you miss the point, it just lays down a the basic disaster senario on a larger scale. A family tries to survive, ... well everything in this one.  However some past flicks like 'earthquake' which should be on blu ray didn't have all the main characters survive and used model work instead of cgi which in this case looks awesome. This is just a fast flick with lots of action so I can't complain, it's not about a real disaster. Hello, the Mayans thought they'd still be around in 2012, so take the calender end of the world thing with a grain of salt. Now if you want a real disaster just look at all of the plastic clogging up everything, lakes, streams, the oceans, but the giant plastic pollution disaster is not going to make a great fun flick.  This is worth watching and owning on blu ray , just don't overanalyze this disaster flick, or any of them for that movie. Disaster movies are escapist fun.
B003HTPHSQ|4.0|Guck mal an: Cindy Lauper die schrill gewandete Quietschemaus der 80er kann Blues singen. Wer hätte das gedacht? Und noch dazu mit dieser Stimme. Das war zunächst gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber bei jedem Mal hören, mag ich's lieber. Sie hat die Gefühlstiefe, um diese Musik zu verstehen und sie hat die gute Portion Schnoddrigkeit, die zur glaubwürdigen Interpretation notwendig ist. Nach ihren ersten zwei Erfolgsalben ist sie ja doch eher so ein bisschen herumgedümpelt, hat sich in schlechten Filmen blicken lassen und sich mit Benefizveranstaltungen im Gespräch gehalten, aber man hatte schon gedacht: Ihre Zeit ist vorbei. Schade eigentlich, denn schaute man hinter die grellbunte Fassade, so konnte man eine richtig gute Sängerin erleben. Ausdruck, Stimmbeherrschung - alles da. Die Stimmlage - Geschmackssache.  Nun hat sie eine Reihe von erstklassigen Bluesmusikern um sich versammelt und verkündet, sie habe immer schon mal Blues singen wollen. Ah-so! Das schöne daran ist, dass man den Blues der alten Kämpen ja x-mal gehört hat, so aber noch nie.[[ASIN:B003HTPHSQ Memphis Blues]]
0061703087|5.0|I love Michael Crichton's books, so I was excited to read this one. It did not disappoint. It's all about nano technology that is continuously evolving. It's a classic Crichton, big company makes things that take over. One thing I love about his books, including Prey, is that not only are they action packed, but he also takes the time for character development. I felt like I was side by side with his characters. This one is told by the main character Jack, from his point of view, and I felt like I was studying and fighting along side him. I'm surprised that this hasn't been made into a movie. Above all, get the popcorn cause this is a fun and exciting read.
B000P0J0EW|2.0|I have been hearing great things about this 'classic\\" movie since it came out in 1994, but only saw it for the first time recently. Even the librarian who checked it out for me vouched for it in the strongest terms (women especially seem to love this movie, for some reason). I found it to be mildly engaging, but formulaic, saccharine, surprisingly vulgar, and painfully cliched. I will never watch it again. For a truly great prison movie, watch \\"Cool Hand Luke\\".

I did hear they are awesome live.(I need to find some new music! I listen to Nat King Cole(This dude had a voice!), Tony Bennet and Big Band music from the 40's!)  Peace out
1440503257|5.0|Dinah Bucholz' Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook is a charming homage to all the food references in Harry Potter's book and film adventures. We love the design of the book which looks like a magikal and wondrous diary someone might discover hiding under stacks of dusty historical papers in a bucolic English cottage.<br /><br />Bucholz's introductions to each recipe which reference various book chapters are an excellent touch and there are plenty of authentic traditional British favorites to choose from ranging from entrees to sweets, including Harry's favorite dessert (Treacle Tart) and the dessert staple from the Hogwarts Express cart (pumpkin pasties).  Just when you thought you couldn't come up with anything clever to gift the Harry Potter fan in your life, this lovely cookbook saves the day! Anyone for a refreshing mug of Butterbeer?

At first I thought it was a great read about how the history of cancer, how it is perceived in society, and how it the treatment of it has evolved from, it is better to do nothing for the patient, though Halsted and his radical surgeries through today's approach.  While I still like the book, I find that Mukherjee's writing style to be a bit over the top and breathless in his description of some things.  The best example that I have found so far is his story of the use of mustard gas in WWI.  The author states that the mustard gas attack caused the death of 2000 British soldiers on the first night and hundreds of thousands of deaths in the first year of its use.  Everything that I have read has said that while mustard causes casualties in that order, the actual number of deaths was much lower, and did not even approach 100,000 for all combatants in the entire war.    I do plan on finishing the book as I have found that the majority of it is good.

The Technic system requires a totally different approach to building models than traditional LEGO bricks. One builds Technic more from the inside out than the bottom up, demanding new and different intuition about how to solve design problems. The wealth of ideas and inspiration here is fantastic.

B000AOEMXM|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that Star Trek: Enterprise got off to a bit of a slow start but each new season was better than the last. It really did get better and I was hooked on the Xindi war and all the time travel stuff.<br /><br />The 4th and final season was when Enterprise really hit its stride but it was just to late. Most shows come into their own around the middle of the 3rd season but not this one. A great cast and good production just wasn't enough to save it.<br /><br />Im a huge Star Trek fan and always will be but I do miss this one. Im very happy I have this in my collection.
0440178002|4.0|One day, I remembered old film whose title was SHOGUN. This film was broadcasted on TV as well before. I was attracted ancient Japanese culture thru this film.  So, that is the reason why I bought this book. The story of this book is actually same as filme's. So fabulous.
B00447G2PM|4.0|As I write this review the price on this sucker is $37.99! Maybe that wouldn't be so bad if it was a full length movie with a DVD and digital copy however you are just getting a 3d disc and a blu-ray disc with 40 minutes of film (You are basically paying $1 for each minute!)    Aside from the price the movie is GREAT! I was lucky enough to get this movie free with my sony 3d tv and it is definitely great to show off to friends! As I said... its about 40 minutes long and includes some of the most beautiful under sea shots you'll ever see.  As far as the 3D effects go, it won't disappoint you! The 3D gives you the depth effect as it should in an ocean setting.  It really looks as though you can walk straight through your tv and swim with the sharks (don't try that at home).  Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet do a great job narrating while Danny Elfman gives us some fun music to listen to!    Overall i give it 4 stars with the price not being an involvement.  It missed the 5 star mark because there were several scenes with heavy \\"ghosting\\" particularly when a squid locks on to the camera thinking its dinner! The squid gets very close up and becomes very blurry when you have your 3d glasses on! it was enough to make me go cross eyed and have to look away from the screen.    I would recommend this to all 3D owners as well as new 3D owners who are looking to either show off to friends or experience the depth of 3D themselves!
1423113497|5.0|I rented the Movie for my kids and they loved it. I bought these 3 books for my 9 year old who loves to read. He read all three books in 2 weeks. He couldn't put them down! Now he's asking if/or when I am going to get him the other two books in the series! They are coming for Christmas, hope he can hold off! He also wants EVERYTHING he can get his hands on that has to do with this series.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Julia Roberts and the other actors are so amazing. What a storyline! What a cast! What words are not said in this movie. Laughs! Great movie!!! A must see!!!Really powerful drama!!!<br />Loved Natalie Portman even more since I saw this movie!<br />Clive Owen wow! Don't want to get on his bad side.<br />Jude Law make up your mind! Smiles! Great actor!<br />Julia Roberts...LOVE YOU!!!<br /><br /> Relationships are made and new ones are made. Old loves and new ones! Don't know what good is until it's gone. Love is a strange thing. Sometimes taking risks is not always a good think. Love this movie!!!

B0043KK4N6|5.0|Christina Aguilera sounds fantastc on this soundtrack. And Cher, even though she only has 2 songs, shines and shows what a legend she truly is.<br />The classic songs that are covered by Christina are impressive. And the new tracks penned by Aguilera are show-stoppers.<br />It's cute, fun, and sexy.<br />I hope they release a songle for the radio soon!
B000002JKS|5.0|I revisit this album periodically and when I do I like it more than before.  It's one of those funny albums where when I first listened to it I didn't like it at all, but when I revisited it later, I ended up loving it - much like my take on Jethro Tull... Although this is way more creative (and interesting) than anything Tull could produce...     It's a shame this spirit is all gone now - progression of time...damaging changes...    Haven't heard this in a long time....maybe I'll give it whirl this weekend :)
B002CAWNEM|5.0|Decent enough movie which held my interest for the 1+ hours it lasted.  Fair acting skills from the main actors, storyline a little over the top but that's Hollywood right?
B003UYUQZW|3.0|This was a fun film to watch but little more.  Shallow plot, charming characters, a happy ending, and lots and lots, and lots of action.  I've wasted more time in a much less pleasant manner; worth seeing, once.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|Am I the only person that is pissed because I pre-ordered the DVD set, and won't be receiving it until Monday, the 6th?  I've always gotten pre-ordered movies on the same day they were released in stores, though I could've gotten them at a brick and mortar store at 10a and I didn't receive my shipment at exactly that moment.  I was OK w/that, because I got it the same day as release.      But why in the world did I bother to pre-order Eclipse, when I won't receive it until 2 days after it is released in stores?  There's not enough of a price break to justify the wait.  This has never happened to me on a pre-order w/Amazon, but it is going to cause me to think carefully about ever pre-ordering again.  Especially in the case of an eagerly-awaited release, because I will probably go to Wal-Mart and get the Blue-Ray edition at midnight tonight.  Obviously, I'll be returning my Amazon-provided copy.      If movies are going to continue to choose unorthodox release dates (not the obvious Tuesday release), Amazon is going to have to come w/a way to continue to deliver on the day of store release.

B000EGF0B4|4.0|I rarely watch movies which are love stories/romance films. In general they do not interest me. However Brokeback Mountain is an exception. It is truly poignant and touching. It is also refreshing to see bisexual/gay men portrayed as masculine. In the majority of movies and TV shows homosexual men are portrayed as effeminate queens. I know that many gay men in real life are effeminate. However for every queen there is also a masculine man who happens to be homosexual. The friendship and love between Ennis and Jack is palpable in this film. The trajedy of the societal constraints which keep them apart is achingly portrayed. My only criticism of the book and therefore the film is that they should have made it more clear that Ennis was bicurious long before he met Jack, and therefore was susceptible to Jack's advances. The sudden, unexplained way they first have sex and begin their love affair is unrealistic and not believable.
031603438X|5.0|This is the mother lode.<br /><br />In all of rock 'n' roll writing there are some towering peaks that stand out from a morass of mediocrity: the Gillmans' [[ASIN:0450413462 Alias David Bowie]]; Peter Guralnick's two volume life of [[ASIN:0316332259 Elvis Presley]], Greil Marcus' [[ASIN:0452289181 Mystery Train]]; pretty much anything by [[ASIN:0434044563 Lester Bangs]]: all, note, written by professional journalists and, more or less, all from the outside. I can't think of a notable rock autobiography: let's face it, most rock musicians don't have the wit, let alone the resolution, to do it, and those that do (the Waters, Bowies, and Waits of the world) have not had the inclination. I suppose they figure, not unreasonably, that what they have to say they've already said.<br /><br />As a result, even those of the greatest rock biographies have tended to be remote affairs, presenting an external face of their subject, already recognisable to the listening public, and rendering through the prism of a fellow listener. (Bangs perhaps is the exception). But a listener cares more about how the end product sounds than the mechanical process by which it is arrived at: For those of us who've toiled over the years as players and wanted the inside perspective, there's been little to go on: a guitarist's tuning and chord voicings; the licks; the visceral details of how songs were ever devised in the first place are hard to describe remotely.  The soul of pop perfection is elusive as a rainbow;  hard for an untouched mortal to describe let alone analyse: its genius is its simplicity: under heavyweight intellectual scrutiny the lightness of perfection burns off into space. Messrs Jagger and Richards have few living equals as composers and performers of the perfect rock song.<br /><br />And what was it like to *be* hooked on smack: to what lengths did you go? What was cold turkey like from the inside?<br /><br />Traditional reportage stays a respectful distance from these questions. But these things are fascinating: they're the DNA of this great cultural artefact, and many (perhaps even most) of the listeners will, at one time or other, have had a go, and got nowhere.<br /><br />For those people - people like me: enthusiastic bedroom rockers of decades' standing - this book is like the Dead Sea Scrolls. Keith - a prophet of the new religion - tells it all. And, by gum, it opens your eyes to the brilliance of the Rolling Stones.<br /><br />Sure: excruciating details about Chuck Berry's riffs (and the depravity of mainline heroin addiction) aren't everyone's cup of tea, but if you've shelled out for Keith Richards' biography in the first place, odds are they will be. But the Mick Jagger/Keith Richards songwriting technique: that they consciously sounded out the right vowels and consonants before fitting words to them - that's fascinating: it explains so well the quality of their material.<br /><br />Now if this were merely a dry and technical anorak's guide to playing rock 'n' roll, that would be enough for me. But it isn't: it's witty, enlightening, and most of all thoroughly Keef: credit to Richards' co-writer who has managed to resist any tinkering with Richards' unique and affable voice: you sense his role was more of a collater, a prompt and a content organiser: if the individual sentences didn't fall directly from Richards' lips then, in the vernacular, I'm a banana.<br /><br />The interesting content of a life such as Richards' is inevitably going to tail off as his modus operandi stabilised: the latter half or a rock star's life is simply never going to be as epochal as the first: and so it proves here; by the time the heroin is finally kicked and the only frisson is regular handbags with Mick (Richards is unfailingly amusing on his account of \\"Brenda\\"), Keith Richards more or less settles down. But it is still a warm story of a man in his dotage, with his family about, and his own recipe for Bangers and Mash thrown in for good measure(thanks Keith!)<br /><br />Authentic, funny, enlightening, entertaining, deadpan. Put this one in the same league as Lester Bangs. High praise.<br /><br />Olly Buxtong, deadpan. Put this one in the same league as Lester Bangs. High praise.    Olly Buxton
B001UW58YU|3.0|It was a good blu-ray purchase.  But unlike other awesome concerts in digital media form, this one does not engage you like those.  I normally can tell when something is \\"special\\" - this one is close.
630542828X|5.0|This movie is well done and documents the years long abuses by corrupt corporations who put profit ahead of people's lives. John Travolta does a great job as the lead attorney.<br /><br />What is sad is the huge number of conservatives/republicans/libertarians who are against all government regulations. They believe in a 'free market' which really means corporations should be allowed to destroy our environment and kill people without any worry from prosecution. Conservatives would love to see all regulations eliminated so that corrupt companies like WR Grace could destroy all the air, land and water in our country. When Bush became governor of Texas it became number one in the country in air, water and land pollution. Because of him tens of thousands of people who were vulnerable either became worse or died. To continue to get campaign cash from corrupt Texas corporations GW Bush gave out 830 exemptions to the worst polluters in the state. He traded the health of every Texan so he could get money from those 830 corrupt corporations to run for governor and later for president.<br /><br />Conservatives and libertarians want to see our country destroyed. They want to see a WR Grace in every town in American destroying environments and peoples' lives. Conservatives/republicans/libertarians cling to their ignorance like monkeys clinging to a coconut filled with seeds. Many tribes get a coconut, hollow it out, put seeds inside of it and then tie a long rope to it. When the monkey reaches his hand in to form a fist over the seeds he can't withdraw his paw because it's still in a fist and he won't let go, even though he can see people approaching with a net to catch him. Conservatives/republicans/libertarians are exactly like that monkey when it comes to ignorance. They run from truth or facts and remained mired in a cesspool of lies and misinformation they hear on right wing hate radio and faux news.<br /><br />But their profound ignorance will lead to the end of our country if they are allowed to continue their assaults against every institution in this country designed to protect the citizenry. They believe in a dog eat dog world where vulnerable people should be preyed upon, just like WR Grace preyed upon their unsuspecting victims in this movie.<br /><br />What is sad are the huge number of conservative republicans/libertarians who profess to be 'christians', but who hate other people and worship corporations, like WR Grace. How can anyone be a christian and a conservative is beyond comprehension. Conservatives hate everything Jesus taught or stood for. Conservative Christians is an oxymoron. No one can be a PRACTICING christian and a conservative at the same time. They are exact opposites.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for its entertainment value and for its social commentary on what we need to do to fight the disease of conservatism/libertarianism/republicanism who are all mutations of the the same selfish, hateful and spiteful people who constantly seek to destroy the lives of others.<br /><br />God (the real god, not the right wing god conservatives worship) help save our country from the absolute evils of FAKE christian conservatives.

B000002J1L|5.0|I have a soft spot for this album.  Although I doubt that it is the best Genesis record, it might be my personal favorite.  This album is a huge leap forward from their previous offering, Trespass.  The longer songs on this album (The Musical Box, The Return of the Giant Hogweed, and the Fountain of Salmacis) all exhibit arrangements that are fluid, unpredictable, yet entirely logical.  All of the shorter tunes are effective and memorable.  For Absent Friends and Harlequin are both poignant acoustic interludes with the latter showcasing the group's vocal harmonies and layered guitars.  Harold the Barrel is a jaunty dark comedy that seems to be a fan favorite.  Seven Stones is the forgotten gem - dark, brooding, full of atmosphere, with the mellotron bringing a dynamic to the music that was not present on the previous album.     The new band members - Phil Collins and Steve Hackett - both contribute an individual approach that blends beautifully with the group sound as a whole.  Collins, in particular, lends the group some virtuosic credibility, and I love his drumming on this record - he is the driving energetic force behind the music, due in large part to the improvisational, polyrhythmic, jazz/fusion style that he had at this point in time.  As with many of the early Genesis releases, the band exploits the multi-instrumental potential of the group - up to three guitars at a time; two guitars and keyboards; bass, guitar and keys; all of this plus the addition of Peter Gabriel's flute and percussion.    Maybe the reason why I like this album so much is the overall atmosphere of the record.  It seems to have a decidedly English/Victorian fairy tale sort of mood, and whether you like that or not, it certainly creates a cohesive offering.  Highly recommended.
B001UV4XX8|3.0|There have been many movies that I have came to the defense of before that have had deeper messages to the film that had to be deciphered to truly appreciate. Vanilla Sky (2001) in particular comes to mind. Some movies can seem confusing on the surface, but if you are willing to dig deeper, the payoff is there. This, however, is not one of those films.<br /><br />**contains spoilers**<br /><br />Clearly the correct response of the test subject is to not push the button. Does anyone not push the button? We don't know, but we can assume most probably do push the button, hence the dreariness of the film. So those that do push the button are left with consequences of their decision to be either A) keep the money and live with your deaf/blind son/daughter or B) have the spouse kill the other spouse that actually pushed the button, forgoing the money, but your son/daughter will regain his/her sight and hearing and be back to normal, albeit with only one parent and presumably knowing the spouse killed the other spouse. Not such a good option either way, though I think you would have to choose to leave your son/daughter blind and deaf wouldn't you? It would be an equally if not worse fate I think for the child to grow up knowing one parent was murdered by the other. However, I don't have any problem with this story arc.<br /><br />The problem comes in what the director says on the Blu Ray commentary about how the higher powers that are conducting these experiments are giving clues to the man/woman about how there is salvation after death. That somehow it will be OK if the wife is killed by the husband because she will be going to better place and will receive some sort of salvation. But, if that's true, what really is the point of their experiments anyway? Earlier on the commentary the director said that the higher powers were conducting these experiments to see if the human race was worthy of salvation or if they should simply be destroyed completely. So, what sense does it make to give salvation to someone who failed the experiment? If so, why do the experiments in the first place?<br /><br />This to me is the big dilemma in the film. The experiments though an interesting story angle just aren't well described enough to make any sense. I suppose the director is perhaps trying to leave it to your imagination, but there are just too many holes here to make this a meaningful film.<br /><br />Final Grade: C+n to someone who failed the experiment?

B000002J29|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this album.  Shall I share?      I am in a position to have heard many bootlegs from this tour (in support of Wind and Wuthering, for the most part) and this offering seems to have captured the dullest performance.  Chester Thompson sounds like he is on auto-pilot, bringing none of the dynamism to the group that Phil Collins was (at that time) known for.  A good example and comparison from this record: listen to the 9/8 section of Supper's Ready which sits there and goes nowhere and then listen to Cinema Show, recorded on the previous tour when Phil still had fusion chops and appeared to care about the art of drum playing - totally night and day, ice versus fire respectively.  I might also mention that the dual drum choreography on songs like Firth of Fifth and the coda of Los Endos are particularly heinous.  In my opinion, one the best things about early Genesis was the empathic, improvisational drumming from Phil Collins.  All of the planned out drum fills in my mind detract from the songs and certainly limit their dynamic potential.  All of this brings in to question why they released this particular set.  Obviously, they had recordings from the previous tour with Bill Bruford on drums, but I gather that they had a bad taste in their mouth after having to deal with Bruford's ego at the time.  Maybe this was the only set of dates that they recorded on this tour, but if that was the case then it is a shame.  Like I said, I've heard other recordings from the tour and what became Seconds Out was probably the worst they could have chosen.  Perhaps, Genesis was already moving towards a more mainstream, non-confrontational way of thinking...    From a philosophical point of view, I question the decision to bring in session musicians to play the tours.  One of Genesis' strengths in the early years was the collaboration of the disparate yet complimentary songwriting styles of the group.  As the group was whittled away (Hackett would leave afterthis tour, Gabriel left two albums before), the songs become less interesting particularly from an arrangement point of view, and I think that it is fair to ask how truly engaged a session musician like Chester Thompson or Darryl Steurmer could be essentially playing covers on a tour.  Don't get me wrong,  post-Gabriel Genesis was professional and polished but it seemed to lack the fire of its earlier incarnations (I acknowledge, however, that one could argue that this happens to most bands the older they get).  So with all of my complaining, why am I giving it four stars?    Because this was pre-cynical Genesis and the setlist in fantastic.  The songs are the best that early Genesis has to offer - dynamic, unpredictable, atmospheric, virtuosic in all the right places.  This was my first Genesis record, and I'm glad it was.  It provides an excellent overview of their early material, and even though it is not their best live representation it is thoroughly entertaining nonetheless.  My complaints about it are merely aimed at perpetuating a dialog with existing fans.  If you are new to Genesis, this might very well be the disc to get.  Incidentally, do get the new remaster from the live box set.  Even though I maintain that this is a relatively conservative offering from the tour, the new mix sounds great - Chester sounds MUCH better and you can hear Steve Hackett.    Oh, and I hate medleys.
0596522347|5.0|I'm giving this five stars since I really enjoyed the book, but it is important to understand just why --    It's a great book from an \\"art appreciation\\" perspective of understanding when you look at a really well done presentation just why, on a technical level, it's well done.    However, for most folks it is too advanced to be a \\"how-to\\" book they can apply in practice, while for graphic arts majors I suspect much of it is just review.    Resonate (and On Writing Well) are more practical in providing guidance for most people.    If you're looking to understand why great presentations are great and don't have a background that includes formal graphic arts it's a great book.  There must be more basic how-to books though for those who just need to put together a legible presentation.    I wonder sometimes what the \\"hidden cost\\" to our business world is of not having more secretaries who could act as editors putting managers words into more coherent form, or of not having more graphic artists to help prepare presentations is.  Or even compassionate HR people who can act as entry-level counselors, instead of outsourcing developing relationships with employees to some vague work-life employee assistance program.  It's easy to save lots of money short-term, but are we really developing the type of organizations that can thrive in the long term?
B003YWUTJI|4.0|Norah Jones' new cd has a wide array of songs from country to great duets.  It's a great album for any time time during the day.  I received this album as a sample and have actually bought the cd for my sister.  A great album with a song for everyone!
B002ZG99NG|4.0|There have been lots of good heist, bank robber movies and few have matched the intensity and brilliance of the movie Heat(Al Pacino, Robert De Niro). I was really surprised that The Town pretty much hits the nail on the head in all aspects of that film along with some others. Matter a fact, taking \\"heat\\" is mentioned several times during the film and there are many familiarities in other ways as well. Ben Affleck does a great job as director and actor here. His performance is good but not stellar, as he has a little trouble with the whole Boston accent, which his brother also had in Gone Baby Gone, but thats a small issue. The movie is fairly plausible and there are only a few action scenes in the whole film. I don't think its worth all the hype it got, but i think its more because of its originality than the actual performances here.    On another note, there really haven't been a lot of good bank heist movies for a long time. The reason i call the movie Heat 2 is because they were masks, use the same strong language, burn the vehicles they took off in, same weapons, and even during the end gun fight scenes they sound and have the same weapons. So yes if your a big fan of Heat as i was then you will love The Town. There is also a similar love interest and i'm not really who you think i am theme that goes along with it. So i won't give away every detail but just a little heads up on what your ready to see.    It's good, its very familiar but not so much so that you really know what to expect form moment to moment. The movie isn't perfect but it does the job and Ben Affeck is becoming a better director than most of the pros out there. So with another few films under his belt he should be on his way to a good career in film making. He's only 38 so he's got lots of time to make things a go, so maybe he'll be the next Clint Eastwood. Who knows.

I got up to speed pretty quickly by looking at the simple instructions and examples in this book. (I was able to engineer a pretty complicated pop-up in 3 weeks) The book does not go into rotating structures or tab pulling structures. I recommend it for anyone wanting to learn the techniques and mechanism in paper engineering, but not for those who want to copy the designs as-is. (beware: a lot of heart-shaped examples)

There band name is very appropriate for the band is very creative with songs that seem to change genres from violent old school punk \\"Mad Jack\\" to prog rockish songs like \\"Tears\\" beautifull track wonderfull bag pipes to Gothish stuff like \\"Isolation\\" and \\"Caution\\" this is a great diverse album as well as band. Chameleons change alot as do they. I also like how they took The Beatles classic \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\" in a unique and stripped down way. Echo and the Bunnymen and Tones on Tail fans would probably like this.

1600247253|4.0|I've been a fan of Michael Connelly and his recurring character Harry Bosch since the first book - The Black Echo- in 1992. When Connelly introduced a new series featuring lawyer Mickey Haller, I was a little miffed that it wasn't a new Bosch book. I was wrong - I loved the Haller character just as much. Bosch and Haller have been appearing in each other's world over the last few books in each series and The Reversal finds them working together.<br /><br />Haller has been asked to lead the prosecution in the retrial of convicted killer Jason Jessup. He has served 24 years for murder, but recent DNA evidence may clear him. Haller asks Bosch to be the investigator on the case. Out on bail, Jessup isn't acting like an innocent man....And the defense attorney is crossing all sorts of lines....<br /><br />As always, the case is intriguing and the suspense builds.  I really enjoyed the courtroom scenes with Haller and the defense attorney verbally sparring. Connelly has taken Bosch is a bit of a different direction with the last few books. He has his daughter living with him and must now stop to consider her safety and well being first. It's a side of Harry that we haven't seen before. I thought the story would end differently, but upon reflection realized that it was right for the story.... and the stories that will follow.<br /><br />I chose to listen to The Reversal in audio format. The reader Peter Giles was excellent. He has covered previous Connelly books and does an excellent job. His voice is calm and modulated for Haller, but changes to a rougher tone for Bosch, effectively conveying the difference between the two and capturing their personalities.<br /><br />Another page turner for me, one that had me driving just a little slower on the way home from work, so I could start another disc. Connelly remains firmly on my must read list with both series. I can't wait for The Fifth Witness due out in April 2011.
0345441184|5.0|Bottom-Line: \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is splendid reading, and I highly recommend it.  A more in-depth and authoritative recantation of the Arthurian legend is not available.<br /><br />Like many children, I was raised on the tale of Merlin, Camelot, King Arthur, Excalibur, and the famed Knights of the Round Table.  My first introduction to the post-Roman Empire era story was a cartoon in my early youth called The Sword in The Stone, which told the tale of how a teenaged King Arthur was able to pull the magically endowed sword Excalibur from the stone in which it was embedded, and thus win the throne of a newly liberated England.<br /><br />In later years there would be many a movie made about the boy king and his mystical kingdom that in the end fell into ruin because of human weakness, but none has been as detailed as Marion Zimmer Bradley's, 1982 novel \\"The Mists of Avalon.\\"  Bradley's tome is an ambitious and sweeping interweaving of the oft-told legend of King Arthur and his celebrated Knights of the Round Table; of Merlin and Excalibur; of Camelot; of Gwenhwyfar and Sir Lancelot, all regaled through the eyes and experiences of a heretofore unknown character, Morgaine, priestess of Avalon and half-sister to the king.  \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is a masterful exemplar of accomplished historical novel writing. One might well finish this lengthy tome incensed at the oft-time unabashed anti-male, and anti-Christian passages, but one cannot honestly deny the addictive allure of grand tale.<br /><br />The power of Bradley's prose is in its ability to draw the reader into the story with sharp, intelligent, and engaging narrative, such as this from the prologue:<br /><br />\\"Morgaine Speaks...In my time I have been called many things: sister, lover, priestess, wise-woman, queen.  Now in truth I have come to be wise-woman, and a time may come when these things may need to be known.  But in sober truth, I think it is the Christians who will tell the last tale.  For ever the world of Fairy drifts further from the world in which Christ holds sway.  I have no quarrel with Christ, only with his priests, who call the Great Goddess a demon and deny that she ever held power in this world.  At best, they say that her power was of Satan.  Or else they clothe her in the blue robe of the Lady of Nazareth--who indeed had power in her own way, too--and say that she was ever virgin.  But what can a virgin know of the sorrows and travail of mankind?\\"<br /><br />From that opening paragraph to the closing, I was hooked, drawn in by the conflict between the old world and the new, between Pagan practice and the over-indulgent, self-righteousness binding of Christianity, and the lose of true personal freedoms it represented.<br /><br />Written wholly from the perspective of the very strong female characters, throughout, within the pages--all 876 of them--of \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" we find a retelling of the epic Arthurian rein stripped of Christian moralizing, and replete with the heretofore untold mysteries of a Earth-bound goddess religion, a faith that is as ornate and beautiful--and indeed more fitting to the way in which the Britons lived their lives--as the Roman Catholic faith.<br /><br />It primarily through the eyes of Morgaine, Arthur's half-sister, trained in the magical rites of the Goddess that this story unfolds like an awakening.  Under the tutelage of her Aunt, and High Priestess of Avalon, Vivian, Morgaine is instructed in the arts of foretelling, herbalism self-discipline, and self-denial.  Vivian seeing the disquieting influence of Christianity spread among her people uses Morgaine as the vessel to secure an heir inherently worthy of preserving the old religion by claiming birthright to the throne of England.  This was the role Arthur, had been designated to fill but, by his conversion to Christianity, fails to adequately discharge. Vivian who at first one might anoint as a villain is instead a heroine; her actions are exonerated by the desire to serve the purposes of a Goddess, one who will not be denied, the mistress of Avalon, the font from which all magic and foretelling find their birthright.<br /><br />Be forewarned, \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is an adult tome, not meant to the eyes of pre-teens; there are frank sexual situations throughout the book, including rape, incest, as well as same-sex coupling. Violence too plays a vigorous part in the story-telling though we as a society seem to tolerate it much more than the frank discussion, or depictions of sex.<br /><br />In setting down \\"The Mists of Avalon\\", Bradley used her extensive knowledge of history and legends to weave a most detailed and believable setting; at times it hard to separate fact from fiction.  The characters she develops are at once likeable--or unlikable--and complex as any human relationship we might develop in their own lives.  Morgaine is a heroin, but a deeply flawed one; Lancelot is not as chivalrous and honorable; Gwenhwyfar is not as pure and innocent; nor Arthur as noble of purpose.  With the folds of \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" Arthur, though he is essential to the telling, is not the central focus of this body of work.  It is the woman in his life that take center stage; Merlin and Excalibur are but minor actors in this world of Camelot.<br /><br />Indeed the Avalon agenda is all-encompassing, with even the Druids of the Merlin's fraternity expected to acquiesce to the whims and wills of the priestesses of Avalon.  In this story of Arthur and Camelot, men are a means to an end; women are supreme as dictated by the Goddess; women do not need men except in furtherance of Her will.  In this telling of the Knights of the Round Table, men are insensitive and cruel; sex is wasted; men are basically animals to be controlled.  And though men rule, they do so with the blessing and consent of the Goddess, and her maiden priestesses on earth cloistered at Avalon.  As a man I see essential truths in the lesson, but I abhor the lesson none-the-less.<br /><br />But more then a struggle for power between men and women, \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is a struggle between the religion that was, and the religion that will be.  Paganism (at least as I understand it) was widely practiced throughout Europe during the time when Rome held sway over all the lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea and beyond.  But as Christianity swept out of the Middle East into Europe, Pagan practices were pushed aside, often times violently, replacing the freedom of Pagan worship with the restrictive laws of Christianity. Monotheism replaced polytheistic practices throughout the continent.  Bradley captures that struggle brilliantly; some may say she is very uncharitable to Christianity throughout \\"The Mists of Avalon\\", but I believe she is being as true to actual history as any telling thus far.  After all Christianity does enjoy a long history of self-righteous evangelism, a practice that often-times destroyed the society it missionaries claimed to want to save.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />\\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is splendid reading and I highly recommend it.  A more in-depth and authoritative recantation of the Arthurian legend is not available as far as I know (the movie version of this book was abysmal).  Bradley's narrative descriptions are verdant without being overly tiresome, whether she is describing wardrobe, setting, battle scenes, religious services, sexual dalliances, or even mundane household items, her prose flows like water over a newly born leaf. The dialogue is imperative and the scenes fluid and not the least bit ill-conceived.<br /><br />The ending left me chilled and disappointed, but I understood the necessity of the closing.  One might walk away after reading \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" feeling as though Bradley despised Christianity, but I believe she was just being true to the history of the movement and its long lasting effect on human societies.  And though men are oft-times depicted as weak throughout the book,truth be told guys, if we really love a woman to the depth of our souls, and with deepness of heart, we are but putty in their hands to be molded into that which she sees fit to accompany.he-less.<br /><br />But more then a struggle for power between men and women, \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is a struggle between the religion that was, and the religion that will be.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|...This is an outstanding series. It depicts how the war in the Pacific was fought, and the travails that men had to go through. It is both intense, and riveting. As a son, and nephew, of men that fought in that campaign, it brings me closer to them.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|Now, not necessarily everybody who states this album is great or amazing is lying, but those who judge it as so under it being a \\"hip hop\\" album are unequivocally wrong. This album is better suited among ex Nsync fans, Justin Bieber admirers, Lady Gaga fiends and such. If pop was the genre the five star reviewers critiqued it under, then you could be right in hailing it as great, I don't know the first thing about pop or what makes a good pop album. I just know pop when I hear it. But if you look closely you will see that this is listed under Rap and Hip Hop, which makes things VERY different indeed. In that respect, this album is a failure to the highest degree (artistically, not commercially). There is no vision, there are far too few moments of lyrical finesse (from the hip hop interpretation of lyrical finesse, not the pop), the production falls so far outside of hip hop that some may be ashamed to play this at high decibels. From start to finish, this does not sound like anything but corporate, sales, marketing, gimmicks, psychology and most heinously, disrespecting one of the few last true musical art forms by polluting it with the likes of this album. There are many people giving great reviews because, as another reviewer wrote, they attend the Church of Minaj. This is true. There is nothing she can do that they will disagree with. Fans are a thing of the past. Now we have worshippers and disciples which is frightening for quality control within the industry, but great for the idols and labels. Also there are many people who simply want to see her fail and dish out harsh reviews. While they may be right on this album (it is dreadful as a hip hop album) wishing failure is what gives the teenagers incentive to yell hater as if its a war cry. To conclude, if you know good hip hop and are looking for just that, KEEP AWAY. But if you are open to pop music, Nicki may have what you are looking for.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|As someone who pre-ordered this movie in 05, this is by far the best release.    The movie has been re-cut and omitted scenes have been re-introduced, which allows for a much easier grasp of the storyline.    The best reason to get it on Blu-Ray is that, like other effects driven films such as Avatar or Transformers, this movie was simply made to be watched in 1080p. The detail of the CG is simply lost in translation to DVD and kind of ruins the effort and time put in by the animators to make this worth such a long wait. If you're going to watch Advent Children, you HAVE to see this version or you simply will not have the full experience.
B001NXDSLQ|4.0|I was still in my early teens in 69, but the love generation was everywhere. Everyone seemed happy and most introductions were started<br />with ..Hey Man.... and ended up with ... PEACE !<br /><br />In the late 60's, thats the kind of music we had on the radio. Great music<br />poured out continously on the am and fm stations.<br />  Never watched Woodstock...so i figured it was time to watch it. Am i<br />ever glad i did...this movie will bring you back to the sounds and moods<br />of the 60's. You will be amazed at the quality and how young the musicians<br />were....Wow sha na na...and the who...almost kids. Just to see everybody<br />soo young and full of muscial energy is worth the trip...but hold on, as<br />this film also shows you the crowds ...the events ..how they build the<br />stage...what the town folks said of all these young people gathering<br />nearby.<br /><br />So, if you like the music..or you were born in the 50-60's you will<br />have a upper hand on enjoying this musical event.<br />A keeper for sure.
B001AQO3QA|1.0|I skimmed few reviews, saw the mentions of problems with playing it. I have a region free Panasonic DMP-BD50 player with the last firmware upgrade and live in Switzerland. My player has no trouble with any Region A or Region B BD. Yes compared to DVD it takes longer to load and get to show the movie but that is \\"normal\\" for BD.    However it took well over 5 minutes (!!!!) to load the first movie. On top all you get is a black screen and you have NO idea if is working got stuck or what. Then in the setup it says that there are no under-titles. But when you FINALLY get to the movie (in case the extended 2003 version) in the Display menu you discover that there are 18 different subtitles.    Now I have no idea if is this new MU-whatever feature that causes this SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOW load or is something else wrong. In any case seen the obscene price I hope that this will be fixed or a forget the new feature quick-load option should be added.

B003KGBISY|5.0|Akira Kurosawa is one of the best directors in the history of cinema, and \\"Seven Samurai\\" is Kurosawa's finest work.  As a director, Kurosawa perfectly captures the characters individual perspective, thoughts, and mannerisms.  Even though I don't know Japanese, I started to forget that this was a foreign film.  I was so captivated by the richness of the characters that I was more focused on the story.  The battle sequence, at the end, was intense and memorable.  The only sad thing about the film is that it is unlikely that another director will make a film is great as this one.<br /><br />The Blu-ray copy of the film is extraordinary, providing great contrasts even in the darkest scenes.  The sound can be a little bit harsh, but it's possible that this reflects the original source material.

From the collaboration list on featuring it seems like Norah has many fans in the music industry that love her soulful voice as much as I do. I was truly impressed with the list of collaborators and loved the mix created with Norah's voice along side hip hop. Who would have thought this would sound so good, but I enjoyed every song on the album and can listen to it again and again, unlike most albums out there. Thank you Norah for providing us with something different - it's like a genius playlist on one album.

B00428ZRFE|4.0|What can I say about this album... I have to give props to Jay-Z and the rest of Def Jam to returning Rihanna back to the sound she was best known for in the first couple of albums.  Though Good Girl Gone Bad still remains my favorite Rihanna cd, Loud is a big improvement from Rated R, in my opinion.<br /><br />Man Down and Cheers (Drink to That) are great songs mixed with her Caribbean sound infused with an uptempo Hip-Hop beat.  One of my favorite well sung songs in her career so far is California King Bed, it has a alternative-r&b that kind of reminds me of Fergie's Big Girl Don't Cry.  Fading, reminisce of a the song Take a Bow, would be something I recommend to those going through a recent break-up.  S&M and Skin are erotic songs exploring one's sexuality.<br /><br />Songs that didn't capture my attention were Raining Men and LTWYL-II.  LTWYL with Eminem is much better from his album plus she didn't bring the vocals and no offense to Nicki fans but I didn't care for the lackluster-robotic rapping on her part with the track.  Complicated had too much of a pop-dance feel that didn't suit Rihanna well, so I found it to be a misstep.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the cd was worth the listen so if you a Rihanna fan cop it!

1593272782|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I really like 'The LEGO Technic Idea Book: Wheeled Wonders' but after perusing through it a bunch of times, I just couldn't give this 5 stars.  The book is ENTIRELY an inspiration book with pictures of lots of cars that the author has made.  The color JUMPS out of the book, the cars are neat, but there is only a MINIMAL amount of instruction on how to make these.  So the reader looks at stuff the author makes and can try their best to replicate, but without some more guidance, it's more a coffee table book than anything else.  If there were less machines and just a tiny bit of instruction, this would easily be 5 stars.  However, 4 stars isn't bad, and it's still a nice pick up for the LEGO enthusiast.<br /><br />**** RECOMMENDED
B004B8RXQQ|5.0|I was prepared to not enjoy this present day version of Sherlock Holmes.  I adored Jeremy Brett, so was ready to unfavorably compare Benedict Cumberbatch.  I absolutely love the new Sherlock Holmes in every way.  Sherlock fits very comfortably into the 21st century.  He was ahead of his time anyway, and Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman (from The Office) are brilliant in their portrayals of Holmes and Watson.  I can't wait for the next series.  I have watched these more than once (purchased them as I don't own a television set)to catch every little detail that might be missed on a single viewing.  Also, Moriarty, Holmes' archenemy, is bizarre and mesmerizing as played by Andrew Scott.
B000002AGE|4.0|This 1977 release opens with Zawinul's exuberant masterpiece, \\"Birdland\\", a composition that carried fusion into the mainstream and brought it to the attention of a vast new audience.  Combining sax and guitar with electronic keyboards, Weather Report created closely written music of real grandeur, while still allowing some improvisational touches, and for six ecstatic minutes, made it accessible enough to be enjoyed by everyone.  I can't think of any other single track before or since, that better exemplifies what fusion was meant to be.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you don't catch lightning in a bottle very often.  The rest of this album is good, don't get me wrong, but there's nothing close to the level of that first track.  After the ecstasy of that opener, you might want to chill out with \\"A Remark You Made\\" - a melancholy number that I personally could have done without.  Up next, Jaco Pastorius' \\"Teen Town\\" is a fun little bouncy piece that features lots of his inimitable lead bass, but  \\"Harlequin\\" kind of stumbles along at a stilted pace, its wispy lines forming bizarre shapes.  \\"Rumba Mama\\" is a live performance piece for percussion and vocal in a World music vein, which shows the wide range of the band's influences, but it may not be the kind of thing you need to hear over and over again.  Shorter's \\"Palladium\\" is a solid, energetic entry, fusing sax, keys and percussion to create an unusual but pleasing band sound, while \\"The Juggler\\" is an almost ponderous, synth-heavy tune that ambles along without ever getting anywhere.  The album closes with \\"Havona\\" which features more of those truly amazing bass runs from Pastorius, but doesn't really have much of a melody.<br /><br />I imagine it was the band's intention to suggest the many possibilities of fusion without reverting to earlier forms, and in that I think they succeeded.  On the other hand, I don't suppose there are that many listeners who are just in love with every track here.  Fusion remains an acquired taste, and mainstream listeners who are drawn in by \\"Birdland\\" will not necessarily be impressed by the whole album.  Bass players and fans of fusion generally, should probably consider this a must-have, but traditional jazz fans, or devotees of popular instrumentals, may not be over-enthused.mainstream listeners who are drawn in by \\"Birdland\\" will not necessarily be impressed by the whole album.

B0043URV8M|5.0|Whenever a Harry Potter soundtrack comes out, I always look forward to it. Being somewhat of a movie score nerd, I always look for good soundtracks to movies. Anyone can put a collection of songs from an artist together to make a soundtrack, but movie scores require more work. If you don't do a good job matching musical styles to the feel of the film, you can tell immediately.     That in mind, I felt that Alexandre Desplat's score to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was a well-done score. While trying to infuse aspects of previous installments on top of creating something that is his own, Desplat did a fine job crafting a score that was worthy of a Harry Potter film. While many may complain about his lack of use of previous motifs seen in Harry Potter films, Desplat created new motifs, while keeping part of those previous themes present. One of the biggest complaints from fans has been the lessening use of Hedwig's Theme, which has been one of the most recognizable themes throughout any of the Harry Potter films. But what one must realize is that when a new composer is brought in, that composer must be able to create something that fits with their style of composing,. This doesn't always result in continuity in the music scores. The first three Harry Potter films, under the leadership of the great John Williams, was expected to be loved more than any other composer. Seeing all Williams has done for musical scores over the years, nobody can argue this.     However, Williams, being the high demand composer he is, wasn't able to continue beyond the third film. This is where many argued that the music dropped off. I would argue against this. Doyle did a great job composing a score that would be worthy of the Harry Potter world. Hooper did a good job with the fifth and sixth films as well. Many people will immediately look down upon their scores solely on trying to compare them to the amazing work Williams did. Yes, there isn't much comparison. But on their own, they were good scores nonetheless. Everyone expects a John Williams score every time, but it isn't going to happen. Williams constantly changed his style when doing movie sequels. This is present in the Indiana Jones scores, as well as Star wars.     Standout tracks on Desplat's score includes Snape To Malfoy Mansion, Sky Battle,  Death Eaters (they finally get their own theme), Ministry Of Magic, Hermione's Parents, Lovegoods, & The Deathly Hallows. While it isn't going to be able to stand against any of William's scores of the first three films, I would consider this the best score to come out since the second film. I loved the scores from Doyle and Hooper, but something about Desplat's score really resonated with me, and I love it for that reason. Give this album a try, and try not to immediately put it up against the scores of the first three films. Otherwise, you're not giving the album a chance it rightfully deserves.
0545310601|1.0|I share the same opinion as many of the reviews I've read so I'll try not to repeat all the same points.  I really loved HG, and liked CF, and truly believed that the author would complete the series in like fashion.<br />The reason I liked HG so much was that even though the main premise was so violent and depressing, we saw it through Katniss' eyes.  I thought the violence portrayed in that book was only what was necessary, and that we saw Katniss' compassion, strength, love for others (especially with Prim, Gale, Rue and Peeta), and her willingness to sacrifice for those she loved... and with Rue and Peeta we saw her ability for this even in the most horrifying situation.  And the only time Katniss killed in the first book was in self-defense, or defending someone else (Rue), or as an act of mercy (at the end when I think Cato was being tortured by the mutts).<br />None of that feeling was in this last book.  The violence was frequent, descriptive and without meaning much of the time.  And I agree with the others that state that the main point seems to be that war is horrible... and is it to say it's never ever justified?  I'm left wondering if the author's intention is for us to come away thinking that the people of the districts should have left awful enough alone and just stayed under the control of Snow and kept sending their kids to the HG every year?  What kind of message is that?  And this is a young adult book (my son read it and I did), so what message are the kids supposed to take from this?  Should they think people should never fight for their freedom or what's right?  That evil wins over goodness, hope, love, and sacrifice for others?  In the original books, I thought there was a greater message that the author intended about the capacity for goodness in people, and the need for compassion and love and hope... and none of that is in this so it just leaves you feeling depressed.  I can contrast this to what I know is true as an adult but wonder how confused that can leave some kids feeling.  I also thought that there would be an understanding of the reason the rebels needed to fight for their freedom and that the sacrifices would have meaning but there was none of that either.<br />At least one of the other reviews mentioned that they wish we could call a mulligan and have a new Mockingjay book written -- I ditto that!  There was so much potential for a deep, thought-provoking, enlightening ending to this series and it just didn't happen.

With 'The LEGO Technic Idea Book: Simple Machines', the pictures are enough to get the job done.  Like other books in the line, this SCREAMS inspiration and in beautiful full color!!<br /><br />Great for all LEGO Technics lovers, you will LOVE this book!!<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

B000000WG4|5.0|Arguably the seminal release of the progressive era, Oldfield weaves a hypnotic web of guitar and keyboard lines that gradually builds into a pinnacle of real grandeur.  Each track filled an entire album side (back in the days of vinyl) but contains enough melodic changes to keep the music fascinating throughout.  There are no real lead vocals (not in the traditional sense) and very little rock energy, but the beauty and drama of Oldfield's composition and playing is enough to keep the listener captivated.  The first side is definitely the stronger of the two, opening with the familiar, eerily quiet theme from \\"The Exorcist\\", moving through a series of variations on that theme until it's mutated into a driving, Bolero-like showpiece for keys, distorted guitars, and other less-common instruments, including the promised Tubular Bells (chimes, to U.S. listeners).  To my ears, the second side sounds like an entirely different composition.  It opens with lilting guitar lines that take us into a slow, beautifully melancholy organ solo in waltz time, then on to a Scottish-sounding theme where the guitars take the role of bagpipes, followed by a more upbeat section featuring the \\"Piltdown Man\\" - surely one of the most unconventional vocals ever recorded.  After another quieter interval the piece concludes with a couple of rousing choruses of the \\"Sailor's Hornpipe\\" played at accelerating tempo.  A playful conclusion to a bona fide masterpiece.

0596806027|4.0|I recommend this book for web developers! The title covers some of the new features available to developers in the recent release of HTML5, including but not limited to canvas, video, and microdata. I would not recommend this book for beginners in web development, the text reads as if one already has a decent comprehension of earlier versions of HTML and XHTML. For those already familiar with previous languages, this is a great primer into HTML5, briefly explaining use of many new features. The book is authored by a Google web engineer and it shows in some of the examples of how to get things working. Being such a new addition to the language, there isn't a whole lot available on the market for study, but the book references many additional resources for getting HTML5 up and running.

B002ZG97RE|2.0|Well at least you can give the liberal filmakers credit for a decent action flick here....subtract the outrageously outlandish , sharply romanticized liberal spin job here , and there are enjoyable action sequences and suspense here. You can literally jump into the writers heads, and just FEEL their   \\"assessment\\" of how things went down in the Iraq war. It really is a typical liberal tactic , it seems, to interject pure fantasy and downright fabrication and weave it into a make believe story , and use that as a vehicle to say 'see!, THIS is how things REALLY were, and how we really felt about it all!'. Charming. NOT. lol.....One of the biggest liberalized slants was so over the top, I was chuckling to myself.....that a soldier, any soldier, but specifically in this movie Matt Damon's character, would actually have the audacity, wherewithall and motiviation to 'go rogue' as it were, with the actions he took. Some of the things this 'soldier' was doing, was straight out of the Bourne movies! lol... His actions were so over the top, you almost felt like the guy was not in a military branch...he was taking actions like a CIA agent or again his Jason Bourne character. Nutty stuff...So in summary, subtract the incredibly clumsy, embarrassingly obvious and downright amateurish attempts by the filmakers to portray a politicized story wrapped around current events, and you have a reasonably entertaining flick. Liberal hollywood should take note, and just shuck the clumsy political bias point-of-view story-fabricating, and just give us an entertaining movie ala the Hurt Locker.

B000E1MTZE|4.0|The complete matrix triology was wonderful. It should be retitled, so people would know that it's a behind the scene documentary instead of the movie triology.

0765326353|5.0|Wonderful story, engaging character, overall it is very well written.  Even though it is clear this is the start of a very large series (estimated at 10 books), the pacing and storytelling feels great and it is much more than just an introduction book.  There is enough resolution to give a satisfied ending, but there is plenty left to make you want the next book(Sanderson has said he would like to do 2 books every 3 years until the series is finished).

Going through the biggest career advances of her live yet struggling with an eating disorder that owned her life.  The pictures of her in the book are startlingly scary. The book seems very much written from the heart and very truthful almost painful in spots.  It just left me wanting more.  Really 3.5 stars.  I enjoyed her writing but give me another book or two.  I want o hear about coming out besides, \\"I am gay.\\" More please. I want to hear about the ALLY MCBEAL show, and something about ARESSTED DEVELOPMENT that was just an after thought.  Also if you get the book to hear about Ellen you are going to be dissapppointed, not nearly enough.  Come on, Portia, more please.

031603438X|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable books I have read in a long time.  Partly that is because of the subject matter, since I have been a long time Stones fan and recognize that Keith is the backbone of the band.  But his autobiography approaches that subject matter in a particular way I found most compelling.    My wife is a writer by trade, and is now making her way through the book, too.  We have talked about what is it that makes the style in which this book was written so compelling?  I think it is a combination of a willingness to tell the story with brutal honesty, but in a style that is kind of like Keith is talking to you as a fan and friend.  For a man of such accomplishments, he seems much less egotistical than someone else in his position would likely be.  That I think reflects who Keith is as a person, but the net effect is that the book's writing style fits like a comfortable and well worn leather jacket.    A couple of points I want to make, some made and some not by others here include:    The best part of the book is where Keith talks about the experience of playing music to an audience, and how that has been a large part of his motivation to be who he was and is for all those years.  You have to read those parts for yourself, but I found them wonderful and quite revealing as to what makes Keith tick.    The photographs were quite well chosen to complement the narrative.  The effect of the choices made give the impression that much work and thought went into this part of the book's production.    Keith somehow succeeded in giving honest opinions about those he encountered along the way in a way that was not catty or overdone.  Again, honesty was the hallmark.  Particular subjects included:    Gram Parsons.  Keith has written before about his personal views on one of his best friends and also the ways  unknown to many in which Parsons so hugely influenced music.  He expounds on those thoughts here.  I had hoped for a better explanation of what happenedwhen Parsons left Nellcote, after which Keith and Gram did not encounter each other again leading up to Parsons's death.  But I think the real explanation can be found in the recent bio on him, which was basically that Parsons wore out his welcome way overdoing it on drugs.  In short Keith's partial exception to the honest approach I guess was done in honoring Parson's memory.    John Lennon; The Beatles.  Keith cites Lennon along with Parsons as the two people he encountered who he felt had the most similar approach to and feelings about music as him.  Another slight criticism of the book, though, is that although Keith includes some rather amusing and revealing recollections of Lennon, I didn't see much about why he felt so kindred to Lennon's music.  He does talk at various points about the dynamic relation between the two bands, to informative effect.  Circling back to more recent encounters with Paul McCartney was also amusing and somehow felt just right.    Chuck Berry.  The nature of his complex view of Berry, a complex man for sure, were not surprising to me since knowing of Keith's difficulties putting on the show honoring Berry back in the eighties.  But Life does put in Keith's own words his views of Berry who, after all, was a particularly huge influence on Keith and the rest of the Stones.      The Other Stones.  Not surprising to anyone who has followed this band over the years, but they certainly have included people with quite distinct personalities!  Accordingly Keith lays out his own different views of them and their interactions over the years.  Jones certainly was a tragic figure, but again with honesty as the hallmark Keith also points out that there was much that was dysfunctional about the man.  My theory as to why Keith does not talk all that much about Wyman is that to this day I don't think Keith really understands Bill.  In particular Keith does not understand Bill's decision to retire, and I think that made him hesitant to theorize more about Bill.  Charlie and Mick Taylor come in for relatively more praise, although on a personal level Keith seems to have concluded that Taylor was not exactly Mr. Personality.  Not much is offered here on Taylor's decision to leave the Stones, or what I view as the worst career move in the history of rock music.  Others have talked about his views of Jagger and Ron Wood, so I will leave off discussing them.    The Women in his life.  As noted by Maureen Dowd and others, Keith despite being the iconic rocker, arguably the coolest guy who ever lived, seems to have had a very decent and honest way of relating to the various important women his life.  He somehow has a bit of the knight errant in him, which I guess can fit with the pirate and druggie.  In him it seems to.    Other aspects of note include Keef's Guitar Workshop discussions, which as a guitarist myself I found amusing and informative, and I don't think a lay person would or should feel otherwise.  He doesn't talk too much about technical aspects, such as choosing amps and types of guitars - just enough I think to not bore the non musician, while revealing some of the essentials, like how he sought the sound of certain periods, particularly the  Jumping Jack Flash and the Beggar's Banquet sound, as well as recording Exile.    It was Hard Work!  Keith makes clear that much of understanding him and his life involves that he was intensely driven to make the music, and to an almost superhuman extent.  The countless hours in the studio, the difficulties in pulling things together, the way he and Jagger wrote the songs, are all laid out here.  And love of the music itself drips off the narrative all along.    Drugs.  Honesty again is the hallmark.  Somehow Keith lets you know how much he did without apology, bragging, glamorizing, or encouragement of others to do the same.  How did he pull that off?  He does.    As others have noted, autobiographies are different than biographies, and as a  biography this is lessthan complete.  But as an expression of how Keith felt about his life and times, and his involvement in those events and the long period leading up to the present is such that Life is a good argument (if unintentionally so) for saying that Keith was himself the main circuit cable running through those times, this book is an immense success.   I finished the book thinking, I hope Keith writes something else, again, soon.    Thanks, Keef.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Darren Aronofsky has been circling movie news sites pretty frequently as of late. He recently signed on to direct the stand-alone sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine (appropriately titled The Wolverine). He also developed a rather large and devoted fanbase over the course of directing fantastically surreal films such as Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and The Wrestler, but his psychological thriller Black Swan has also been gaining quite a bit of steam leading up to its December 3rd release. Despite Aronofsky's already well-established reputation and the rather high anticipation for the film, Black Swan still delivers a product that is even better than expected.<br /><br />Like most ballerinas, Nina (Portman) lives, breathes, and is completely devoted to dance. Artistic director Thomas Leroy (Cassel) is preparing a new spring production of his interpretation of Swan Lake. Nina is next in line to become prima ballerina after the former dancer to hold that spot, Beth Macintyre (Ryder), reluctantly retires. Everything seems to be shifting in that direction until a rather unorthodox, provocative, and unstable (in a dangerous kind of way) dancer named Lily (Kunis) arrives. Lily seems to have an eye for Nina's spot as soon as she walks through the door. Thomas begins to see Nina as the White Swan, which signifies innocence and perfection and Lily as the Black Swan, which is more sensual and deceptive. The problem is that one dancer is required to play both parts. Other than the stiff competition she has to deal with, The Swan Queen role begins to take its toll on Nina who begins to think Lily wants even more than her spot in the production. Nina's obsessive behavior leads to her releasing her dark side that she must now struggle to control.<br /><br />Aronofsky has always had an exceptional eye for cinematography in his films. His use of micro-photography in The Fountain made the entire film a visually stunning spectacle that will stand the test of time while something like a someone's pupil dilating or a drug deal gone bad in Requiem for a Dream is memorable because of the way and angle Aronofsky shot it rather than relying on its disturbing content to make the scene a classic. Black Swan is no different. Being placed behind Nina whenever she heads to the dance venue gives the viewer a rather unique third person perspective that also gives the impression that you're walking right behind the main character of the film. The intense dream sequences are also shot in a way that flawlessly blur the line between reality and hallucination. Is this really happening or is it all a figment of Nina's deteriorating imagination? Figuring that out is half the film's charm.<br /><br />The extraordinary main cast is the main ingredient to the film being as great as it is though. The key players all seem to have this twisted side to them that is nearly the exact opposite of the way they first appear to be, which coincides with the Swan Lake theme. Winona Ryder steals most of the screen time she's given whether she's trashing her dressing room, yelling obscenities in Portman's face, or sitting in a hospital room. Even though Mila Kunis seems to play nothing more than her role in Forgetting Sarah Marshall to the most extreme degree on the surface, it's the edge she's given that results in unpredictability for her character. While Vincent Cassel's performance is strong thanks to his sensual reputation with his dancers and Barbara Hersey is both charming and disturbing as Nina's mother who seems to secretly be trying to live in her daughter's dance shoes after a missed opportunity in her past, it's no surprise to hear that Natalie Portman is the heart of the film. Nina is so consumed with dance that she keeps pushing herself even when her mind and body begin to show her that she's had enough. Her breakdowns are heartbreaking and engaging to watch while her transformation by the end of the film can best be described as a monstrous beauty. It's all thanks to Portman's powerful, phenomenal, tour de force performance.<br /><br />While some might not be surprised that Aronofsky has created yet another masterpiece, this may be his most solid and well-rounded film to date. Black Swan is a beautiful, disturbing, and captivating work of art that features gorgeous camera work, an excellent and mindbending story, and what is perhaps the performance of Natalie Portman's career. It's hard to argue with Black Swan being the best film of the year.al, tour de force performance.

I watch it all the way through several times a year.    Some of the best dialog ever! It's better in context, but lines like, \\"Well, my days of taking you seriously are certainly coming to a middle\\" are unforgettable. If you like space sci-fi at all, get this series. If you like westerns, and are willing to go out on a limb a little, get this series.     Word of warning: once you see these you will be mad at Fox for cancelling the series!

B002ZG981E|4.0|I was expecting much more of a mind bender based on reviews...this movie disappointed in this regard. More of an intellectual action film than deep brain twister. Easy to follow, very straight forward, not too deep and no surprises. Nice ending that left me thinking for about an hour but then I moved on (whereas the movie Primer had me thinking for a week and compelled another viewing). Can't say I feel I need to see this film again. Very good for what it is and much better than the usual garbage pumped out by Hollywood. 4 out of 5.

B000002G0P|5.0|I have been an Extreme fan since 1985 when I heard them in clubs in the Boston area when visiting friends in college. I have all albums, cassettes, cd's and videos made by this group, but this by far is my all time favorite. Words cannot explain the meaning that this cd holds within it. Truly a masterpiece in itself, Nuno Bettencourt and Gary Cherone are musical geniuses and it is apparent on this cd. Unfortunately, this was never the huge hit it should have been because of its release date, the timing was just off. Had it been released a bit earlier, it would have been one of the greatest releases of all time. I had the opportunity to see Extreme on this tour at The Beacon Theater in NYC and they were simply amazing. The pure heart and soul that they put into their live shows is surpassed by no other.    Extreme is back and working on a new cd. I can't wait to add it to my collection.

0307473708|4.0|Like so many others, I was a fan of the TV series before checking out the books.  After more than 50 years of reading, I must confess to being something of a snob: very little popular fiction appeals to me.  I need really good writing to keep me interested.<br /><br />Jeff Lindsay has it.  On the surface, his style might seem breezy and light, a little reminiscent of Lawrence Sanders's McNally novels (albeit with much more grisly subject matter).  But this book reads very smoothly, with the just the right pacing.  Even though I knew generally how the story would end, I found the book difficult to put down.<br /><br />The TV series adds a lot to the story, mainly in the development of the supporting cast.  We get very little of that in the book, as it's narrated by Dexter, so we don't see other viewpoints.  Hector gets a name check and not much more; Doakes, LaGuerta and Deb differ in subtle ways from their TV incarnations.  Only Vince Masuoka is immediately recognizable.<br /><br />For me, the show and the books complement each other nicely; they're like two parallel worlds.  I'm glad the series brought me to read the books; it's rare that I find a popular novel that is truly an enjoyable read.
B002ZG999U|2.0|It may be a star-studded, testosterone laden action movie with lots of violence and explosions, but I think it really comes down to being just a boilerplate, cookie cutter film. I enjoyed the action but didn't really find myself with much investment in the characters or the plot.
B004AQR29C|5.0|About a third into The Expendables, I thought to myself, \\"This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time.\\" And the next 20 or so minutes were not fun as it just got worse.     But then...in one scene where kilo upon kilo of cocaine is stack like lumber in an outdoor storage area, I realize wait a second..maybe this is genius. Maybe it's bad - ON PURPOSE. Maybe Stallone is being IRONIC.    It makes sense. All the action movie superstars, the horrible one-liners, the Quake-like exploding in half bodies, the imaginary island generalissmo...they've all been there before. They've been pawns in Hollywood's Blockbuster game. And when this crop goes, there'll always be more to take their place.     What makes it so amazing is that they all keep a straight face throughout the movie as if..as if..they really were ok with making the worst action movie ever. But inside, ladies and gentlemen, they were laughing. Laughing a knowing, ironic smile.    Touché, Mr. Stallone. Touché. I tip my hat to you.
B003A4IFGY|1.0|I like a lot of Petty's music, however I found this CD to be a lot more like \\"folk\\" rock.  Not a whole lot of good guitar licks or solid lyrical charm like there was on previous CD's.

030726999X|4.0|I read this a while back so I cannot remember the details of this book real well.  I do remember wishing I had read it immediately after the second book since I had forgotten some details.  I also thought the beginning was very detailed and forcing myself through it.  As much as I love Blomkvist, I was getting tired of his hook-ups, and his sudden change in heart about relationships was strange.  In this trilogy, usually the pace picks up about 10-20% into the book.  In this book, I thought it was not really until 50% into it that the pace quickens.  After that, the book moved at lightning speed and I could not put it down.<br />Lastly, I remembered when I finished this book, although I was very satisfied with the way trilogy ended, I was sad not to read any more about Salander!
B003L77GRO|5.0|DEXTER  Season 5 is the best of the seasons so far.  While last season was dominated by the presence of John Lithgow, the shining star of and surprise of this season is the presence of Julia Stiles as Lumen, an abused victim who escapes her abusers and pledges to join Dexter in 'stabbing out' her revenge.  The writing is tighter and the subplots or sidebars are far more interesting: the many different love entanglements keep your head spinning.  The fellow workers with Dexter (Michael C.Hall) remain the same - Jennifer Carpenter (the real Mrs Hall), Desmond Harrington, David Zayas, Lauren Velez, CS Lee, and James Remar - all better than ever.  But the added attraction characters this year include Maria Doyle Kennedy (from The Tudors) as the nanny for Dexter's son, and Jonny Lee Miller as a twisted Inspirational Coach.<br /><br />The premise of following a serial killer who chooses as his victims criminals who would have otherwise not been punished is by now, after four seasons, a character we can all understand - emotionally, motivationally, and as a brilliant law enforcement team member. But the coups of the season was the addition of Julia Stiles who does some of the finest work of her career here. Enough said. The suspense is what drives this show!  Grady Harp, December 10
0307595579|5.0|I got into the \\"Millenium Trilogy\\" kind of late, so having this boxset was perfect for catching up on Stieg Larsson's literary phenomenon.  I enjoyed the characters(how can you NOT love Lisbeth Salander?!), and the plot was intriguing and challenging too.<br /><br />Now, on to the 'deluxe boxed set' itself.  The three books(plus one collection of essays,etc.) are housed in a sturdy cardboard case.  The case itself is very well made and over the glossy black color there are three golden symbols(a dragon, a hornet, and a fire).  You have to see the boxset in person to appreciate how cool it looks.<br /><br />The books themselves are different from the previous hardcover releases.  First of all, the dust jacket covers are gone now.  Instead you get them in clothbound form, with cool designs stamped in red(book 1), black(book 2), and dark blue(book 3).  It all looks very cool, and I honestly prefer it over the previous releases.  The books have the uneven 'deckle' edges, even the fourth volume.<br /><br />So, if you have all previous hardcovers, there might not be enough here to 'upgrade' your collection.  But if all you have are the softcover books(or even if you're an uninitiated newbie to Stieg Larsson's work and haven't read a single word of the \\"Millenium Trilogy\\"), then this box set is the thing to get.
6304711905|5.0|In my humble opinion, the best western movie ever filmed. My Clint Eastwood and John Wayne friends think that is BLASPHEMY! However, it is certainly one of the most entertaining westerns with a star studded cast of Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliot, Powers Boothe, Stephan Lang, Dana Delaney, with cameos by Charlton Heston, Jason Priestly, and Billy Bob Thornton, and others. There have been many other renditions of the shoot out at Ok Corral, and the historical versions are numerous, since there are many arguments about what really happened on that day. Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday is astounding, even though Hollywood looked the other way on Oscar night. His dialogue is often hysterically funny and entertaining, and sometimes very serious. Kilmer becomes the person, and his acting is superb, and probably the finest of his career.The movie is very entertaining, since it has action, humor, and a love story, along with great actors who fit the roles perfectly. Maybe the story has been Hollywooded up a little, but that's entertainment, and it certainly worked for me! I highly recommend this movie.
0375836675|4.0|I read \\"The Book Thief\\" months ago, but its imagery and characters are still so vivid and alive in my mind.  I needed to read another book by the author so I picked up \\"I Am the Messenger\\" in the library.  It certainly did not disappoint!  I love Zusak's writing and immediately felt a connection with Ed Kennedy, the main character.  At times throughout the book, I wished that I could meet some of the people personally (ie Milla, Father O'Reilly, Bernie, the Tatupu family).  Heck I even wanted The Doorman to be my dog!!  This is how much I loved Zusak's creations in this book.  Zusak made Ed's fear and anxiety so real as the last ace was revealed that I thought \\"I hope the messages are good\\" (page 289 paperback) even before I read the line!  Amazing!  Several great lines in this book, but the best quote was when Audrey told Ed that he was her best friend (page 120 paperback).  \\"You can kill a man with those words.  No guns.  No bullets.  Just words and a girl.\\"  I was a bit confused at the end.  I admit, I had to cheat and look online.  I can't make up my mind if it's brilliant or strange.  Either way, this is a book that I will want to read again in the future.  4 1/2 stars!!
0671027344|4.0|This book was good in the way that it made the reader consider themselves and their lives in the context the characters and the situations they find themselves in. The main character, Charlie, is definitely a wallflower as the title promises, taking no action and letting the world pass him by, taking observation and having feelings, though not acting on them. This can be infuriating at times, yet all this shows is the authors ability to create characters the reader can feel for. I am sorry to say that many of the situations the Protagonist and his mates find themselves in, including those involving sex and drugs, are realistic in this day in age, at least in my high school. I cannot speak for the actual time-period the book is set in, so I can only assume it is accurate for that day in age and leave the judging of its actual precision be left to those who were attending high school at the time. This is a good one-day read and should be considered the next time you want to evaluate yourself without being aware of it.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|My daughter and I went to see this when it came out in Theatres because I always loved Mythology. We fell in love with this movie and have rented it several times since then. Even better, it helped my daughter and I discover the books. I never even knew the series existed. My daughter is in the fourth grade and she was so taken with the movie, we orded all of the books and she read through them in two weeks! Any movie that can encourage my child to do that has my vote! Not to mention, she loved telling me how the movie and the books differed from each other. I know many reviews were dissappointed because they had read the books first. But honestly, what movie ever compares to the book before it? This movie is fun, exciting and a great introduction to Greek Mytholgy. I also loved that it played on having dyslexia and ADD, and said those things were actually gifts and talents rather than disablilities. I reccomend you buy it, not as a supplement to the book , but just as a movie on its own. They aren't anything alike, but the movie is a great addition to your movie library.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|Foreword<br /><br />It was 1988 when Kylie first made her presence felt in the pop world but it was not until 2000 - 12 years later that she finally came into her own. Following four successful albums under manufactured pop gurus- Stock, Aitken & Waterman, she severed ties with her mentors in 1992 in favour of creative independence and new horizons. The albums that followed- 1994's `Kylie Minogue' & 1997's `Impossible Princess' (both on Deconstruction Records) whilst containing a handful of great songs - most notably on her `94 effort, were ultimately misguided and patchy affairs which failed to live up to expectations. By the late 90's, and now having passed the age of 30, it seemed KM's career in pop was all but over. Yet it would be the Noughties in which the Aussie star truly shined. Returning to her Dance-Pop roots for new single `Spinning Around' in 2000, the song was paired with an eye popping video in which she wore a pair of gold hot pants - helping to send it to the top of the charts in the UK & Australia. The rest as they say is history. Here's a brief recap of The Princess of Pop's output over the last 10 years-<br /><br />Light Years (2000) `70's Disco meets early Noughties Dance-Pop on Kylie's big comeback album for the new century. Light Years ft. some great singles in `Spinning Around' `On a Night like This' & `Please Stay' but it all gets a bit too camp in the middle and the majority of the album is forgettable. Light Years marked the first album in a long and successful relationship with Parlophone Records. 5/10. Fever (2001) Not only her best album musically speaking, but also her most commercially successful release. Fever is the center piece of the KM discography. Unlike `Light Years' the 1970's disco is minimal and the camp silliness entirely absent. This album sounds like it belongs in the 21st century; - blending pop with dance & Electro instead of with disco and crappy 90's dance beats. By this point KM had perfected her vocal delivery for maximum effectiveness. As well as her default singing voice she now utilised a sexy almost whispered tone which would be used more heavily on follow-up Body Language. These elements combined with the fact that a number of songs are about lust/sex makes Fever feel like the first adult KM album. All the songs are good, and the production dazzling. Highlights include- `Love at First Sight', `Come Into My World' & the monstrous global smash- `Can't Get You Out of My Head'. 9/10<br /><br />Body Language (2003) More stripped down and laid back than the dance orientated Fever- Body Language is KM at the top of her game. The minimalistic sound of the album is an unexpected yet welcome dynamic and some tracks even ft. traces of hip hop. What makes it all gel is that most of the songs are built around a great hook or catchy melody and every component from the lyrics, vocal arrangements & production - right down to the chic Bardot-inspired snaps and cover font is effortlessly cool. Killer cuts- `Secret (Take You Home)', `Red Blooded Woman' & the sexy `After Dark'. 8/10. X (2007) Following a break from the pop world after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and going on to beat it, KM triumphantly returned to the charts in 2007 with `X'- her 10th studio album. Easily the most diverse album to date with multiple styles explored, that is, within the safe confines of what could still be considered pop music. `Heart Beat Rock's Electro riff gets stuck in your head, the unexpected pseudo Rock of `Stars' works well (though it would have worked better with a slightly heavier guitar tone- but that would never happen on a KM album), Kylie meets J-Pop on `Nu-di-ty' another cool track and there's even an R&B number in `All I See' which is a nice romantic one. X has also got a few duds- lead single `2 Hearts' goes nowhere but overall X is more good than bad. 7/10.<br /><br />Review<br /><br />Album No 11 `Aphrodite' named after the goddess of love debuted at No 1 in the UK albums chart (Kylie's 5th No 1 album in the UK) and it's full of great songs. `Get Outta My Way' is one such highlight- up tempo and very catchy. The chorus is a totally huge and really sucks you into the song. `Everything Is Beautiful' has a nice laid back groove which is like getting a relaxing massage after a hard day at work, 3rd single `Better than Today' is classic Kylie and another highlight- this one is light and fun with a message for everyone to forget their woes and let go and dance Good Times! And `Cupid Boy' another of Aphrodite's best songs whips along like an exhilarating fairground ride set against a fireworks lit sky. But it's not all great `All the Lovers' a slightly odd choice for a first single does not hold up to the previously mentioned tracks and `Looking for an Angel' is the lightest sounding song on the album and similar to `Too Much' if any could be described as filler this would be one of them. On a positive note the album ends on a high- `Can't Beat the Feeling' like many Kylie songs is about the euphoric feeling of time spent with a significant other and like her best is up-tempo and contains a positive charge that seduces the listener and makes you feel good.<br /><br />Kylie has never been a great singer or dancer; instead you could say she is capable & well trained in these areas. She has however always been easy on the eyes and if you combine all these elements you have one hell of a recipe for a pop star. The other area in which she is blessed is in having a team of great songwriters and producers behind her who understand her range and construct music that best highlights her talents. Her sweet spot is up-tempo or mid paced pop tunes. That's were her voice works best and her charisma really shines through. Aphrodite is a welcome return to a more traditional style of radio pop and of all her past works is most similar to Fever. The songs are very catchy and sound huge. The last two albums- Body Language & X, seemed to have quite specific styles they were shooting for but with Aphrodite it appears the primary goal was to just to write & record some great pop tunes. As a result it's hard not to view this as the strongest album since Fever I'd probably tie it with Body Language as her joint second best. Ultimately Aphrodite is another great effort from the one and only KM. Ooh-rah!rt (Kylie's 5th No 1 album in the UK) and it's full of great songs. `Get Outta My Way' is one such highlight- up tempo and very catchy.

B001PPLIFU|3.0|It's not Daniel Craig's fault. His acting is still great. It's the rather incomprehensible script that does this latest James Bond in. For sure, there are the usual cast of suspects, and as usual, Bond saves the day, gets several girls and lives to kill again another day. I couldn't really follow what was going on, though. Maybe it didn't matter. I got the gist. The formula has never varied.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Awesome book I'd recommend to this obese nation and the fit side alike. I give it four stars only because it spoke about pictures, but never had any to show. The story jumped around in an ADD fashion from time to time too, which could be annoying. Still a great and educational book. 4.5 stars!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It has already been said in many reviews... this is a great, truly 5-star book.  At times heartbreaking and sad, but still a book of strength and fortitude.  The writing is absolutely creative and bold.  It will grab your attention, your heart and your time.  Don't miss this book!
B000I2JKCO|1.0|I can't give an opinion.  We don't have a HD player.  SO can't watch it on our set!    We were given a regular DVD.  The movie is GREAT.
B002VLNB1Q|2.0|I LOVED Continuim - a great album with varied styles, mellow tunes and non-offensive language. But this album disappointed me - it revealed a person who's been in and out of bad relationships and it seems like it's left him sad, bitter and spiritually vacant. I liked the first song, but no need to say \\"sh_t\\" in the lyrics. And I didn't care for the song about getting stoned...c'mon man...now I can't listen to this album with my sons in the car...they all liked his music back then, but this one is inappropriate for them...I know, I sound like a prude, but in a world where everyone swears and sleeps around, I'm just trying to raise a family with better values...perhaps it's just me, but it seems like the world has gotten the better of John Mayer and he seems just lost.
B002PAQETY|4.0|I agree with the other mostly favorable reviews of \\"Keep Calm and Carry On\\".  Stereophonics have been very much overlooked here in the U.S. by radio but I know there are serious fans scattered around the country.  I was not familiar with the group until I saw them open for David Bowie at some venues during his Reality tour some years ago.  I found they were a top band in the UK, much of Europe, Asia and Australia.  They have played the Isle of Wight festival twice and other top festivals in Europe and fill sell out stadiums and arenas on their tours.    They have done some limited tours here in smaller venues but without some support by radio their music just doesn't get the airplay it deserves.  Kelly Jones, lead singer and writer of all their songs is a great talent and has also done some solo/acoustic tours.  They were the first group signed by Richard Branson on his V2 Records label.  If you want to hear some great music give Stereophonics a try and you just might become their next fan.  \\"A Decade In The Sun\\" is a compilation of their hits which is a good sampler of their music.
0156027321|4.0|I really had a hard time starting this book. I'm not sure if it made me sad or was just boring, but when I finally past that, I couldn't put it down. I was immersed in his world and I'll admit, it was a bit stressful haha. But overall, great read.
0385342047|2.0|I loved Confessions of a Shopaholic, but I think this series has gotten more tired and stale with every book since. Sophie Kinsella and her publishers certainly seem to want to milk this series dry, but I really feel that she should stop. I have bought every book, hoping that they'd either be kick-started, or that they'd reach a satisfying conclusion, and have been disappointed every time. I don't think I'll be buying any further Shopaholic books.    Mini Shopaholic is completely unrealistic, in my opinion. Minnie is a bratty, spoiled toddler whom I found annoying rather than cute or amusing. Becky's inability to control her is aggravating and makes her seem like a spineless, bad parent.     There is also WAY too much going on in this novel. There are plots and subplots all tangling with each other. I found it a bit exhausting and by the end of the book I was way past done. I only read till the end because once I start a book, I feel like I have to finish it, no matter how terrible. Sophie Kinsella said in an interview that there's more to come in Becky's world, and all I could think was dear God, no!!    I think Sophie Kinsella should write stand-alone novels from now on. I think she's a funny writer, but there's only so much you can do with a ditzy, flaky heroine.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|If you like quality headphones, get these. The only more i could ask for is a little more bass, but besides that they're really good.<br />The mids and highs are perfect, and it also comes packaged really nicely if that matters at all haha. If your thinking about getting<br />\\"Dre. Beats\\" your better off getting these. Dre. beats break really easily, and also dont even sound THAT good. Overall just get them!

031603438X|3.0|Keith Richards is one of the world's greatest guitar players. He's also one of the world's worst writers. There's very little  in this book that allows you to connect with Keith emotionally. Instead, his choppy narrative reads like a police blotter - woke up, did a line, passed out, woke up, outsmarted the cops, did some more. Keith does share some stories about his love/hate relationship with Mick Jagger and the music that made the Stones one of the greatest rock bands ever. But there's not much in the way of character development here,  so the band members come across as one dimensional figures consumed by sex, drugs and rock n roll.     Keith does provide plenty of pictures to help tell the story, but sadly the words lack coherency and fail to provide the glue to hold things together. While there are some interesting interviews with musicians and other artists, there's a scarcity of  insights or quotes from the band members, even after the death of the brilliant but troubled Brian Jones. It appears Keith didn't make much effort to conduct interviews with fellow band members to provide a cross current, but rather just turned on the tape recorder and let it rip from memory. The problem is his memory is spotty. Even in Keith's most personal moments, such as the death of his infant son, the author seems distant and disconnected from the incident, as if it were merely an inconvenience.     While the book will no doubt appeal to diehard Stones fans who lived through the 60's and 70's, younger fans may find  the message to be somewhat out of tune. In the end \\"You can't always get what you want,\\" but I'll give \\"Life\\" three stars out of \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\"    Jumpin'JackFlash

1603425381|5.0|This is a fantastic book to add to your collection of crochet books! First of all, it's beautiful. The colors are amazing with very close, detailed photos. Second, the format is pretty great. It's a wide rectangular book to be able to show the corner of each border. Third, great patterns!! Forth, educational as all get out!    So, it's a given that this book has wonderful borders to use on any project, but the author goes into incredible detail about corners...how to get your work to lie flat and not pull or ruffle. There's even a whole section at the beginning of the book explaining all of this and how to do it. She explains about preparing your crocheted, knitted or woven fabric for the border and the best ways to do this. Also, every pattern is written and includes a diagram so it's a great tool to learn how to read crochet diagrams (like if you want to do any Japanese crochet!).  And I already mentioned how pretty it is. It's a joy to flip through and look at all the amazing work.     I highly recommend this book. It is wonderful!
0756665949|4.0|Overall I am satisfied with the dictionary.  I was a little dissatisfied with the analogy given by the writers about the show being only 10% of the glacier and 90% is unseen.  This seems to imply that this read will reveal a lot more about the story and 99% of the book is things we have already know from the show.  Also, the book goes into great detail about certain subjects and other subjects that seem more relevant or important to the story they are very vague about.  Your frustration with my vagueness in explaining what I mean is the exact frustration I had when reading the book :).
1593272200|5.0|This book has been really helpful improving my software!  If you are a Linux or UNIX programmer, you should get this book. Do you know a Linux or UNIX programmer and want to give him (her? ;-)) a gift? Get this book. I thought it was a stack of manpages, which would already have been great, but this book is the true successor to the historic Stevens works on UNIX. If you think you don't need this book since you know everything already, that's what I thought too, and I was wrong. Even if you won't read it, the 1552 pages will look really good on your desk.

031603438X|4.0|[[ASIN:031603438X Life]].   Comfortable read although it jumps backwards and forwards (time-wise) a little.  It  certainly gives the reader a raw insight to the life of the Rolling Stones - both group members, associates and hangers-on.  A life-style, it seems, achieved almost by default - opportunistic, decadent, eccentric, over-indulgent.  Rodger Shagam
B00000K2W1|2.0|I tried really hard to like this album to no avail. Three good classic songs not much else. Just buy the singles
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a powerful and important movie. Temple Grandin is an incredible person.  She turned what many people consider a disability into a strength and uses it to help others, human and animal both.  Autistic people are not inferior, they are different.  They have strengths that others lack, and we need them to help us see this world as it is.  This movie really makes you wonder about the world we live in and shows how destructive we can be because we can't see some things clearly. I'm glad we have people like Temple Grandin to help lead the way.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|[[ASIN:B003Y74M2S Blood and Sunlight: A Maryland Vampire Story]]    I saw this movie on my first date and I remember thinking I can't believe I'm watching a cartoon but I loved it. And it continues to be great today while some other Disney blockbusters have sort of gone by the wayside. It's the music- you don't have to know the movie to be familiar with the wonderful songs that came out of this. Some of the early CGI seems a little hokey now but it's a terrific adapation of the fairy tale. A few pretty intense scenes early on with the beast and when he's attacked later that may be a bit much for the smaller guys.
B001S33D1G|4.0|Coraline envelops you in the mystery and magic of a resourceful and imaginative child's world.    It is an excellent modern-day fairy tale that incorporates countless elements of folklore and fantasy, from the idea of a disobedient child fighting for the affection of her parents to the existence of other worlds through ordinary-looking doors and mirrors.    But it also has specific elements that are clear nods to classic stories, such as the cannibalistic mother who has \\"a white hand with crimson fingernails\\"; cannibalism is a major theme in tales such as Hansel and Gretel, and white and red are very common colors in fairy tales such as Snow White. And you know how much I love fairy tales!    For a full review, visit my site, Melody & Words!
B003XZ0WPM|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time a couple days ago.  I liked.  I also loved the books and I wish they would continue to make movies for the other books in the series.  It's been a while since I read the book, so I don't know how exactly the movie follows the story-line.
0307454541|1.0|I don't understand the phenomenon that this series has become. I, like many others, picked this book up to read as a result of it being a bestseller that everyone is talking about. I wish I hadn't bothered.<br /><br />I gave up after 50 pages. Yes 50! Why? Because in the space of those few pages I had read detailed descriptions of flowers, home renovations, boats, etc, and still had no idea of the characters or plot. People kept telling me I had to stick with it. I countered with \\"was there more boring exposition?\\" Everyone always replies in the affirmative.<br /><br />Clearly a trilogy that should have been trimmed down to a single book.
142311339X|5.0|Existem trilhões de reviews em inglês.  Essa aqui é pro povo que mora no Brasil e vou escrever em português.      Gente, livro no Brasil é caro! Isso é indiscutível, até a Academia de Letras admite isso.  Hoje em dia, sites como o Submarino vendem livros um pouco mais barato, existem promoções e talz que compensam, e muito.

Recomendo sem qualquer restrição a compra desse produto a todos que gostem de livros de verdade, bem trabalhados e bem produzidos.    Fora isso, o meu livro chegou quase duas semanas ANTES da data prometida.  Não se enganem achando que vai levar mais de um mês para receberem, duvido que passe de duas ou três semanas.  E é uma espera que compensa muito!

1449389627|5.0|Disclosure: I was given an early free access to ebook for a review    Scott, starts the book with myths of innovation, which are pretty commonplace in business and popular culture. He explains in detail and with examples of Newton, Edison and likes and explains the time and hard work they had spent in innovating things they did. At times the book seems to take cynical view of things, but if you read along patiently, you will see realistic and objective view of things.    Author explains the mechanism and frameworks for innovation, at an abstract level, at the same time making it very clear to reader that innovation is not possible merely by use of frameworks/methodology.  The book gives good insight into innovations happened in past and clears misconception popular culture has about innovation. The author is very honest when he says things like \\"Reading a book on innovation is passive and safe. Putting the book down and starting a project is active and has risks. No matter how many books you read, this will never change.\\".    I would highly recommend reading this book, with sufficient time and patience in hand.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|All the other reviews cover the accolades for performers, writers, direction, etc., all of which are richly deserved. ABC has the most disgusting track record on TV for yanking intelligent, well-done shows (The Unusuals, Pushing Daisies, et al) without giving a chance for the audience to build. Truly sad. I have no doubt that Modern Family would have followed suit without the critical acclaim. One would hope there is a lesson to be learned here, but I'm not holding my breath...
B003XU02QG|5.0|After seeing nothing but junk for the last month, I found this film to be quite a surprise. It is a bit bloody but if you look past the blood and gore, I think anyone will find this to be a hidden gem.  Great job considering it's not a big Hollywood \\"blockbuster\\" kind of film. I highly recommend it!
B0028N72A8|4.0|The story of Google IS the story of the internet in the 21st century. In the last ten years, Google has dominated the web and become the authorative source for internet search as well as a global leader in internet innovation, technology and monetization. All while holding fast to their principles of putting people and customers before profits... which is stated in their enigmatic corporate mantra \\"Don't Be Evil.\\" (by the way.. this is a witty and somewhat snarky reference to Microsoft which they see as the Evil Empire)<br /><br />Though this book was written in 2005 and a lot of water has flowed under the Google bridge since then, it covers in great detail the 'early years' of how Sergey Brin and Larry Page first envisioned a better way to search scholarly data while pursuing their PhD's at Stanford. As they developed their capabilities and technology, their vision grew to include searching the entire internet. Which was a bold statement in 1998.<br /><br />At the time, internet search was simply a way in which titans such as AOL and Yahoo could attract people to their sites and keep them there so that they could promote and advertise to them. The fact that the Google guys wanted to provide a fast and easy search and then immediately take you to the information you were looking for was seen as being amateur and not a viable business model. In a post DotCom bubble world, many were asking 'Where's the money?' More concerned with solving the search 'problem' than with monetization at the time, Brin and Page secured $250,000 of start up money from an Angel investor, rented a garage in Palo Alto, California and went to work.<br /><br />Within a few years, their brand was growing on a global scale without spending a dime on advertising. Welcome to the era of viral marketing. While Google didn't invent 'word of mouth' advertising, they are a perfect example of how creating a better product and respecting your customers can lead to explosive internet growth. By 2004 when they went public, Google had become a verb in our modern lexicon and had millions of users across the globe. They had managed to create a fun and inviting, campus like, workplace at their new Googleplex, were luring top engineers and PhD's away from Microsoft and other industry titans and had launched some of the most innovative initiatives on the internet, including Pay Per Click advertising (okay Overture created it.. but let's face it Google perfected and then dominated PPC), Google Earth, Google Images, Google Scholar and many, many more. Their innovations have placed powerful resources for information at our fingertips and has made Google a global economic force with earnings greater than General Motors and Disney combined!<br /><br />Butcher, baker, candle stick maker; no matter what you do, if you use the internet to market and promote your goods, services and brand, read this book to learn the Google story and get a glimpse into how it all started. For many, this may be all you need to know about Google. For others, this is a great starting point for further study.<br />[[ASIN:B0028N72A8 The Google Story]]had become a verb in our modern lexicon and had millions of users across the globe.

B003S897U0|5.0|I listen to lots of different artists and I have a wide variety of musical tastes, so I almost feel like some sort of musical aficonado, though I don't know what qualifies as one. I do however know what qualifies as a \\"KeyStone album\\" and I think this one will qualify. A keystone album is a jewel that no record collection should be with out.   You can here the age creeping into Chris Robinsons voice, road weary and little less falsetto than he may have jammed in there 10 years ago. Sort of like how you'd expect him to sound after 10,000 shows. He is aging gracefully (his voice) sort of like Robert Plant, he knows he can't hit those high notes like he used to but he still sounds great.  With younger brother Rich and the rock solid Steve Gorman on drums as well as the rest of the band, re-work these older songs to a stripped down version or an entirely differnet feel by changing tempo's and timing to make the songs feel fresh. It's like a great cover band doing justice to an already great body or great bodies of work. Only this band is covering their own songs. Tha's how every artist should approach a greatest hits album, like they are a cover or tribute band . . . Like this album, Croweology.

1592332803|4.0|Great cookbook overall. Yes, many recipes use all-purpose flour and white sugar.....but I just switch it out for whole wheat pastry flour and reduce the sugar sometimes. The results are still good. I've tried the apple cobbler, cinnamon coffee cake, brown bread and zucchini bread. They were all good, but the apple cobbler was irresistible. I served it at two gatherings and everyone loved it; this recipe just rocks! I look forward to using this cookbook a lot. Its nice to have one vegan baking cookbook instead of one for cupcakes, cookies and so forth, in my opinion. In the same breath, I was a little disappointed by the cookies section. I was hoping for some more variety. But, I guess, the author had to limit herself, because she covers so many types of desserts. Also included is a lot of helpful info that other reviewer have mentioned, like explaining various vegan ingredients, etc. Overall, I like this book and would definitely recommend it to experienced and new vegans alike.

B00428ZRFE|5.0|I Love this album   (Did I say that already?)  I think that Rihanna produced this album beautifully  I like the way she went out on a limb and tried something new  And boy did it work out well!!!  I think that her music shows her personality and her thoughts very well  The album has a good mix of pop and vocal intensive songs  It was a good change from Rated R (given that there is no parental advisory)   Parental advisories dont bother me at all, im an adult  BUT it was good to see that she could produce the same great music and not be limited to explicit lyrics  I LOVE RIHANNA  Could you tell?  This album still has a few similarities to Rated R, with the whole sensitive side and all  But it is much more upbeat, pop, and dance  A real winner from start to finish!  No Need to skip any songs  My personal favorites \\"California King Bed\\" and \\"Skin\\" (Skin is very sexy)  Check out my blog for more things Rihanna and Fashion as well   [...]

0061997811|5.0|This is a great item to own if you are a fan of the films and its actors.  Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson each write a short foreword and the book is broken down by film and characters, filled with behind-the-scenes facts and anecdotes.  An added bonus (and perhaps the best part of having the book) are the replicas of certain infamous Harry Potter props, such as Harry's Hogwarts letter, the Marauder's Map, a Yule Ball programme, one of Dolores Umbridge's Educational Decrees, sample packaging and stickers from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, etc.
B00005R24K|5.0|I purchased copy of this particular moive because if you play it on your TV with all the lights out on Halloween it is great background noise.

B0017ZB8M6|4.0|Katy Perry's secular music debut isn't a work of staggering genius. It's not amazing artistry. But it's catchy, witty and fun. The title is fitting in some ways, but for the most part Perry comes across as very dangerously female. She's smart, sexy, and tough. And, to top it all off, she knows how to have fun with her music.     One of the Boys - 5/5. A good way to start off. It's fun and catchy.   I Kissed a Girl - 3/5. Not my favorite. Not because of the theme, but because I think it's a musical and lyrical low point.   Waking Up in Vegas - 4/5. More fun that anything else.   Thinking of You - 5/5. One of the most emotional tracks. When Perry gets serious, she does it well.   Mannequin - 4/5. Not much to say about this song. It's the kind you can't stop listening to and you don't have a good reason why.  Ur So Gay - 4/5. I feel like I shouldn't love this one, but I just can't help it.   Hot 'n' Cold - 3/5. My second least favorite track.   If You Can Afford Me - 3.5/5. It starts out with one very simple message, and switches gears halfway through.   Lost - 3/5. My least favorite. It's not very memorable or well written.   Self Inflicted - 5/5. A serious topic and a catchy tune that go very well together.   I'm Still Breathing - 5/5. In my opinion, the best track. Perry's voice and the bleak music underneath make for a heartbreaking song.   Fingerprints - 4/5. Pretty much sums up the point of the album. Not the best track, but will get stuck in your head.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|This is the best album of the year, do yourself a favor and buy it!  There will be no regrets.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I find it a bit sad that the animated Batman films seem to be much better than the live action films, but we seem to be saddled with that as a fact. Although I liked the two films done in the reboot, I'm not really tempted to re-watch them. \\"The Dark Knight\\", in particular, was so unremittingly tense, with no breaks whatsoever to give the viewer breathing room, that while I regard it as an excellent film, I have no desire to go through that again.<br /><br />This plot in the animated film shows how to achieve the balance that \\"The Dark Knight\\" failed at. While the story IS dark and tense, there are humorous moments, especially from the mouth of Nightwing, that prevent it from pushing the viewer farther and farther down with no relief.<br /><br />The story is about the rise of a new crimial, The Red Hood. This guy is fully as homicidal as the Joker, aothough his cold blooded killing seems to be reservered for Gotham's criminal elements. In fact, if it weren't for his cold blooded mass murders, one might well approve of his actions, as he seems to be pitting the worst and most powerful of Gotham's criminals against each other. When he proves seemingly superior in fighting ability and acrobatics to both Batman and Nightwing, questions arise as to just who this remarkable new man on the scene could be.<br /><br />It is a mystery that Batman quickly solves, and the answer is just as shocking to the viewer as it is to the Batman himself. The solutions to the story bring us a rich plot that belies and surpasses the animated nature of the movie.<br /><br />The animation is a visual treat, and contains enough frame by frame detail to make you forget it is animation. From backgrounds to facial expressions (even behind the masks), much attention was paid to making sure this came across as a rich environment.<br /><br />The voices performances were outstanding across the board. Bruce Greenwood's as Batman is entirely natural and believable. As much as I like Mark Hamill, this Joker to me was a big step up. He came across to me much more believably as the sociopathic killer and sadist the Joker is made out to be, but has so often seemed forced in other performances. I was entirely captivated by the performances, without a break in the illusion of either the story or the animated format. That's hard to do, and is a credit to both the animation and the acting. It is a very mature story and set of themes which at once legitimately bring into question the Batman's methods, yet validates them. Again, that's a feat which is hard to accomplish in any film, and it is brought off here solidly.<br /><br />I think anyone can enjoy this film. If you are particularly a Batman fan, then you'll enjoy it all the more.ross to me much more believably as the sociopathic killer and sadist the Joker is made out to be, but has so often seemed forced in other performances.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|I liked this movie as a quick glimpse into Temple's life. As a preschool speech-language therapist, I had some basic information about Temple, but this movie helped me view her as a person and experience (view) some of her trials/tribulations. Bought the film after renting it first and have already loaned it to classroom teachers I work with. Recommend this film to those who work with persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), parents of children with ASD and anyone wanting a short glimpse of the possibilities that one can achieve when even just one person gives them a chance.

Can any customer that has purchased this title recently from Amazon confirm that it is now being packaged in a keepcase as shown?

0345479092|2.0|Hogg makes some good points in this book, particularly regarding realizing a newborn is a fully sentient being, that it is intelligent, and to treat it with respect.  Beyond that, I didn't get much out of this book.  Her tone is condescending, and her assertion that you MUST do it her way or you're doing it wrong is ridiculous.  Her audience is likely people who really need to understand the balance between intuitively knowing what newborns need, and what regiment they must apply.  Sadly, that's the audience that will throw this book out the window because she's so heavy-handed about it.
B004B4RCDE|5.0|I respect the opinions of everyone but I can't imagine any Rihanna fan not loving this album!!    Right now, my favorite song is \\"Raining Men\\" - I listen to this at work and I can't help but get a tiny little groove on @ my desk (ok, maybe more than a little).    I'm pleasantly surprised at her vocal talent/range on the song \\"Complicated!\\" She really brings the vocals on the chorus of this song.    Of the songs on this album, there are about 6 that I'd listen to over and over and not get tired of them anytime soon.  That's a 5 star review in my book!

B000B8IA2G|2.0|Stargate Atlantis gets off to a great start in the Antarctic, but after moving an entire crew of explorers to another galaxy, they lose no time in stargating to another Northwestern American set (the location of most of the stargate adventures). There they encounter a new civilization that speaks flawless English and warns of the Wraith, a new enemy the explorers don't ask a lot of questions about. Instead, they stumble into a nest of the nasty creatures -- life sucking aliens who also speak English, albeit with a more menacing growl. Not only that, having been warned of how bad, how formidable and how utterly evil these Wraith were, they all split up and into small groups and wake the creatures up! Now they, too, must battle for their lives through five seasons of fun, games and shooting ten-shot Berettas at this new enemy. Unfortunately, the biggest enemy is glitches on the DVDs that cause the image to freeze, then turn off the player (at least it did on mine...repeatedly...and other DVDs work fine. I may have gotten a bad batch. Who knows?) But I got tired of having to restart the shows. As for the episodes themselves, some are as irritating as some of the 60-ish STAR TREKs (WARNING: If they have kids in them...especially with recurring actors...just go to the next episode.) Another minor irritation with Stargate episodes is recurring sets -- sets you saw repeatedly in SG-1 shows!) In some cases you can say, \\"Hey, that's the field where that alien ship was buried,\\" or \\"that's the set where the Jaffa camps were!\\" In a new galaxy that's really something you'd expect from amateur film makers with 8mm cameras (before video). But you just have to suspend disbelief. Or belief. Whatever. Anyway, the characters make up for the rest of the cheesy stuff. I also get sick of the extras sitting around in conversations, watching the main players, but never uttering a word. Guess that's because you'd have to pay them. Oh, well. Buy 'em anyway...if you can get them to work.

1427210497|3.0|There are those books that you read that you wish would never end....this book, for me, was not one of them.  I found myself elated when I heard the final few sentences from my audio version of the book.  I thought it would never end.  The story is not bad per se, and the reader is good, really good, but the story itself and the characters never quite hooked me.  I find it difficut to get engaged when I am not emotionally invested in any of the characters.  I frankly did not like or relate to any of the characters in the book.  You start off the book with Patty & Walter Berglund, a hip, couple with a couple of kids living out the dream in St. Paul.  Over time, you scratch the surface and the happy Berglund family is anything but.      As I listened to the book I thought about the title, \\"Freedom\\" and what it meant, and it reminded me of being a kid where your parents tell you, \\"sure, you can make any decision you want, we all have the freedom to make our own choices, but you will have a consequence for your decisions, both good and bad\\".  The Berglunds make a lot of strange decisions, which cause the family to drift apart and the marriage to become that of two relative strangers sharing a house but not \\"a life\\".      I did not read Mr. Franzen's earlier book, \\"The Corrections\\", so I cannot compare as to whether this is better or worse or the same, but for me it was just a middle of the road novel.  Nothing special, no great moments, no compelling characters.
B0042816YK|2.0|This is a silly trifle of a movie.  I love silly romantic dramedies, but this one tackles deep subjects with the cinematic equivalent of one of those little pink ice cream sample spoons.  It's watchable, but not really worth the time.
0443069522|3.0|this book is great for med school anatomy! great pictures and charts!! (for the most part...)    my ONLY problem with this book:    someone clearly forgot to edit the last chapter on the head and neck. which is a shame because this is one of the hardest topics in anatomy. It is so bad that i have found myself needing to use other texts (Moore's Clinically Oriented Anatomy-awesome book) to make up for it.     For example- some charts list wrong innervations and functions of muscles. In addition to clearly obvious typo's, it is a very poorly organized chapter which jumps all over the place. One second you are looking at the jaw, the next you are in the neck, and somehow you make your way to the nose. It doesn't flow well at all.     To make it even more difficult, in the later parts, when the authors go back to discussing structures in the head, such as the nose and mouth, they tell you to refer to previous pages from the beginning of the chapter. Those pages listed are incorrect, making it all the more frustrating....     and finally, although it will tell you all the functions of each muscle it does not tie it all in well. A simple straight forward explanation of mastication and other very important functions of the head would be very helpful. I know it's an anatomy book, but if it wants to be a clinical anatomy book, it NEEDS to discuss these things, even if it's just a general explanation in a small diagram on the corner of a page.    Also one thing it lacks is a final section on the function of each cranial nerve. All it has is a two page chart at the beginning of the chapter, but Moore's has almost an entire chapter devoted to this with diagrams illustrating everything. Gray's simply has the chart and discusses the nerve when it is relevant to the structure you are reading about. It is extremely annoying to jump around in a 250 page chapter when you are just trying to learn a branch of one nerve. (remember, the pages it tells you to go to are wrong...)    My suggestion- buy the book for everything else, and study the head and neck elsewhere... this book is a waste of time for it. (especially when you have so very little of it in med school)
B003NFM3JU|5.0|Nothing can beat its a Wonderful Life, but this comes really close.      I was amazed by the story line, graphics, and Carrey's performance.  Scrooge is rotten to the core and in the end becomes a great man through his conversion.  Loved every minute of it.

B0040QYROK|5.0|A few years back, Kino released a DVD of a restored version of \\"Metropolis\\", taken mostly from camera negatives. The image quality was outstanding -- sometimes even superlative, as if the film had been shot yesterday. Unfortunately, large chunks remained in limbo, and the plot -- such as it was -- still didn't make much sense. Nevertheless, that version was warmly welcomed, as most public domain editions looked as if they'd been buried in a manure pile before being run over by a dozen Panzer divisions.<br /><br />Since then, a 16mm reduction of the complete film was found in Argentina. Though horribly scratched (the transfer from 35mm was botched), we now have the complete film (except for two brief and unimportant scenes that had deteriorated beyond recovery). Even more important, a \\"censor's copy\\" of the complete intertitles was found. The latter (along with the manuscript of the film score) allowed the scenes to be correctly ordered, /and/ with the proper titles. The characters' motivations are now clear, and the story finally makes sense.<br /><br />Up to a point, of course. If one can accept sentient androids, one might accept Rotwang putting synthetic skin on the False Maria. And then there's the problem of the Heart Machine stopping and the subsequent inundation of the underground city. True, such a city would need continual pumping to keep out the water. But it doesn't just /leak/ back in -- it positively explodes.<br /><br />Regardless, \\"Metropolis\\" is now a genuinely entertaining film that holds one's attention from beginning to end. It has a number of iconic scenes -- most notably the \\"machine as Moloch\\" devouring its human \\"children\\", and Rotwang bringing the robot Maria \\"to life\\". Whether \\"Metropolis\\" is a \\"good\\" movie (in the absolute artistic sense) is beside the point. It's an influential classic, and anyone who loves movies should see \\"Metropolis\\" at least once.

0316098337|4.0|The early pages of the book were a struggle.  I had to force myself to invest the time early on.  The investment was well worth it.   This is a highly readable engaging book.  It is not perfect by any sense.  In particular I felt that Jack's language and thought process were occasionally, but only very occasionally, inconsistent.  There were other aspects of the plot I found less than realistic but do not want to provide any more specifics because it would ruin some of the surprise elements.    But in the end, what is a book supposed to do?  It entertained me.  It made me think.  It made me think about the subject and the primary premise but it also lead me to think about related topics.  For example, I frequently travel on a worldwide basis.  I am used to seeing new cultures and different ways of doing things.  But this made me think of the person who was born and raised in one town and never travelled or exposed to different types of people, sights, or sounds and then was quickly relocated to a new land.

B0043A0PXU|5.0|Annie Lennox has an iconic voice and she has put it to careful use in this album of Christmas music. Along with Mike Stevens, she arranged all the tunes, so this is a personal statement of songs she has sung since she was a child and, according to the liner notes, have accompanied her life. Particular favorites are Lullay, Lullay, Silent Night and Angels From the Realms of Glory.<br /><br />It is the arrangements and the layering of Lennox's vocals creating a seamless envelope of harmony that makes this album distinctive. The appearance of the African Children's Choir adds yet another dimension. So often the annual batch of Christmas CD releases by popular artists are products with profit, not quality or creativity, as the sole motivation. Not the case here. This is a wonderful CD and from the beautiful artwork that looks like it was made from engraved plates, to the very personal and thoughtfully written liner notes to the obvious care that went into each song. This is a CD I will play year after year. If searching for Christmas music that is both familiar and yet different this is the perfect choice.
B002EC3932|3.0|I bought the hype on this and am again disappointed-when will I learn and  stop listening to the critics!     The trio is good, sometimes very good although  when I heard them live-without studio tricks-it sounded bland and brainy.    I don't hear interaction, I don't hear a group, but 3 very good players.
0142414999|4.0|Christmas comes best in threes<br />A lot of people have already summarized the three short stories (which are tangentially interconnected, might I add), so I will attempt to be brief:<br />Jubilee's Express: After Jubilee's parents are arrested in a Flobie Christmas display fight, she is sent on a train to her grandparents, only her train ends up stranded outside a Waffle House.<br />A Cheertastic Christmas: Tobin leads his friends, Angie \\"the Duke\\" and JP across town in the middle of a bad snow storm to a Waffle House to meet up with some cheerleaders.<br />The Patron Saint of Pigs: Addie, who has recently broken up with her boyfriend, starts to realize she's a self-absorbed biatch.<br />Because this book is so different (three stories, yet really only one long one), I will review it slightly differently.<br />The absolute best, most amazing, most outrageously funny and sweet story of the bunch is, in my opinion, Maureen Johnson's Jubilee Express.  It's quirky, it's extraordinary, it's insane, but never once did I drop my suspension of disbelief.  Jubilee is smart and funny and reminds me a little of myself.  I thought her relationship with her boyfriend, Noah, was complicated and interesting as well.  Noah was a great boyfriend to Jubilee when she didn't need him to be emotionally engaged.  When she did, he didn't know how to react, being so self-centered and so focused on his aspirations.  It was clever, it was different, and yet it was realistic and believable.  Stuart was a sweetheart, and his family was so charming and quirky.  The story was quick, outrageous, and yet somehow believable--and most importantly funny!  I was reading this while flying to Denver, and at one point, I was shaking with barely contained laughter.<br />John Green's story, A Cheertastic Christmas was enjoyable as well.  The scenarios were crazy and funny, the character growth very organic, and the ending was perfect (yeah, a little rushed, but it was almost told in that teenager way of hurrying).  But I'll admit, I wasn't too keen on the whole \\"tough girl falls for best friend\\" act.  Also, and more importantly, the characters in this story were the EXACT SAME as in the other Green novel I read (the ONLY other Green novel I've read), Paper Towns.  Tobin was Quentin; JP was Ben to a \\"T\\"; the Duke was oddly reminiscent of Margot (although there were obvious BIG differences, to those who've read Paper Towns).  Even the story was eerily familiar of the big cross country drive that Quentin and friends took in Paper Towns.  It was like this was the further adventures of Quentin without the main character being Quentin.  Don't get me wrong, Green writes his characters well, but when I open a new story, I expect to see slightly different characters, not the same ones over and over and over again.  Same with story.<br />\\"The Patron Saint of Pigs\\" by Lauren Myracle was a complete downer for me.  Most of the action takes place after Christmas (bye, bye Christmas charm and spirit!), Addie is so mopey, whiney, and ungrateful in the beginning (not a good way to endear an audience to your protagonist), and the situations, while nowhere near as weird as what Johnson and Green wrote, seem contrived.  The pipes break at the exact time Addie is rinsing out the steamer?  Her boss gets mad at her...because Addie can't shut off the water because the pipes are broken and it's not really her fault anyway as she didn't break the pipes herself?  Everyone and his mother decide simultaneously to let Addie know how selfish she is?  Nathan is upset at her because she never \\"read the note\\" and calls her selfish...but he's been harping on this for four years?  How does that not make him whacked out?  Sure, Addie's a selfish @#$%^, but he certainly doesn't have to gripe about the \\"wrongs\\" she \\"done him\\" four years ago.  And when Addie calls Dorrie about her recent crisis, Dorrie gets upset because Addie still hasn't gotten the pig.  Only, Addie has been at WORK the entire time unable to go on break, and that's why she hasn't been able to get the pig.  Yeah, it's selfish to want to chat before getting the pig, but really, Addie TRIED to leave work to pick up the pig, and her boss wouldn't let her.  So that isn't Addie's fault, it's her bosses fault, and it's Dorrie who's being the @ss for blaming the wrong person.  And the whole shoehorning \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" needed to go.<br />Overall, though, I really liked \\"Let It Snow\\".  Johnson's and Green's stories and characters are wonderful, funny, and charming (not to mention, very Christmas-y!).  Individually, I would rate them 5 and 3.5 - 4 stars respectively and would definitely read them over and over again.  As for Myracle's story, unless you are already a fan of her work, I wouldn't bother with her story (even though it does tie up Jeb's loose end).  It's kinda depressing, not really Christmas-y, and bonkers.  Two stars, by itself.<br />So head off to the bookstore or library, snatch this guy up and snuggle with a cup of hot chocolate under a blanket in front of your fire or Christmas tree and start reading!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

0525951652|5.0|The best book I've read in a long time. I have read thousands, and this is one of the best. WARNING: If you are a reactionary right winger, religious fanatic, or do not like history and facts JUST SKIP THIS BOOK. This book is better than the pillars of the earth. It puts a human face on the historical events of the early 20th century.
B000001DTM|5.0|The Album Cover says it all.  Achtung Baby showed how U2 could dramatically and adeptly change the game and invest in a soundscape that was both bold and different - yet inviting.  Without this album, U2 might've been just another band living off past glories - a fate that would befall bands like INXS and countless others. With Achtung Baby, U2 deepened their appetite and daring to venture into the unknown.  Hinted in their previous album with Bullet the Blue Sky, Achtung Baby took distortion and mission into a new zone.<br /><br />Listening to Achtung Baby today - it's a brilliant piece of work that has stood the test of time.  Bono expands his vocal and stylistic range yet again.  The Edge's riffs cut dissonantly through the air like an edge.  Larry and Adam hold down the rhythm section.  The Achtung Baby repertoire would bear classics like \\"One\\" - so extremely passionate.  \\"Until the End of the World\\" - amazing.  \\"Even Better than the Real Thing\\" and \\"Mysterious Ways\\" put U2 into a new realm of techno rock meets world music.  Every track has its own nuances.<br /><br />The only downside actually were Bono's shades - which would define his look for the next 20 years.  :)<br />I have to agree that this was U2's peak.  I don't think they made a better album after this, sadly, but they still remain THE band to top live.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I honestly cannot express my utter love for this show. It's the best. It's an incredibly intelligent show, with very quick humor. The Holiday episodes in the 1st season are ones for the history book. They'll be shows I definitely watch every year. I could go on and on forever, but I won't. Buy it for yourself and see.     The 2nd season (airing now) is even better. Every episode shocks me with being better and better.    Amazon also never ceases to amaze me. Got this on Black Friday (not sure if it was only a one day thing or not) for $12. Amazing. Amazon is amazing.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|I got it pretty quick, it was brand new, and I enjoyed it very much. If you are a fan of \\"Samurai Seven\\" or just a fan of foreign films or even just movies in general; this was a fantastic film to watch. It's a pretty long movie so you have to be able to handle sitting down for a while or watching it in two parts, because there is an intermission. Though if you've ever seen \\"Gone With The Wind\\", this will be a cake walk compared to that.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|SPOILER!       Lost started great, and then got lost, but they made up for a lot of grief with episodes like \\"Something Nice\\" during this season. This episode  was a prelude in time sequence to the brilliant, shocking end of Season 3.  The writers decided to give the audience everything they had been waiting for between the two leads with both barrels, and then proceeded to wreck it all to hell.   They deserve enormous credit for this.  Also for giving the male viewers the little scene with Kate coming out of the shower.  Thank you.
0545123275|5.0|My Thoughts<br /><br />I loved this book. I enjoyed the beginning, then it got a bit Twilighty for me, but then I started to enjoy it again. Yes, it is YA romance, which can either be really great or extremely over the top. I thought the story was very sweet, but not disgustingly sweet. It's more of a love story with paranormal elements, than a paranormal book with a bit of romance tossed in.<br /><br />Grace has pretty much raised herself and her parents were off in la-la land most of the book. I usually have a problem with this in YA, but it felt natural in this story. I admire her mature attitude and ability to keep herself composed during chaos. I really enjoyed Grace's determination to care for others and not abandon them. To me, Sam was the star of the book. He is a beautifully written character. So honest, willing, fragile, loveable. The connection he and Grace have is intense, even before she knows his human form. Great connection, great characters.<br /><br />I haven't encountered many books that switch back and forth between the 2 main characters POVs. Some series do many POVs, but there is something touching and intimate when you are hearing only the thoughts of the 2 main characters. It really sucked me into their world, and I felt close to them both throughout the entire story. I seriously wanted to roll around in the leaves with Sam in wolf form and sit and have a picnic with them both.<br /><br />I enjoyed the spin on werewolf mythology in this little town of Mercy Falls. It's definitely different and added quite a bit of suspense and heart-wrenching moments. Putting the temperature at the beginning of every chapter was brilliant. For me, it set the tone of what was to come and set me on edge immediately if it was really low!<br /><br />I'm starting Linger pronto!<br /><br />My Favorite Quotes<br /><br />\\"Grace reached over and began stroking her fingers through my hair. I closed my eyes and let her drive me crazy.\\"<br /><br />\\"It is possible to be in love with you just because of who you are.\\"<br /><br />\\"What do you eat?\\"<br />\\"Baby bunnies.\\" She narrowed her eyes, so I grinned and said, \\"Adult bunnies, too. I'm an equal-opportunity bunny-eater.\\"<br /><br />\\"I said uselessly, \\"Sam, don't go.\\"<br />Sam cupped my face in his hands and looked me in the eyes. His eyes were yellow, sad, wolf, mine. \\"These stay the same. Remember that when you look at me. Remember it's me. Please.\\"<br />Please don't go.\\"<br /><br />\\"Grace,\\" I said, very softly. \\"Say something.\\"<br />Sam,\\" she said, and I crushed her to me.<br /><br />Check out this review at Smash Attack Reads!

B000000QFV|5.0|It's very difficult to track down this album nowadays, but I assure you if you are a Sabbath fan, especially of the DIO albums, you NEED to get Tyr! I actually happen to prefer Tony Martin to both Dio and Ozzy. He is and was my favorite Sabbath vocalist. He has a great ear for melody and a wonderful vibrato which is operatic yet isn't overpowering. His enthusiasm is contagious on Tyr and he elevates the album to new heights. The theme of Tyr is enchanting and the opener \\"Anno Mundi\\" is an absolutely beautiful opener. The use of keyboards is probably the highest on this album of any Sabbath album, but they are used with discretion and they suit the mood well.<br /><br />This whole review also goes without saying that Tony Iommi's riffs on Tyr are the essence of heavy and brilliant. His songwriting talents are on full display and he redefines \\"beauty through simplicity.\\" He is a force of nature.<br /><br />Tyr also features the powerhouse drumming of the late, great Cozy Powell. You can't help but love his driving rhythms and powerful fills.<br /><br />Why people have glossed over the Tony Martin-fronted Sabbath albums is a travesty. Do yourself a favor and give this and the other Martin albums (Headless Cross, The Eternal Idol and to a lesser extent Forbidden) a listen. Tyr and The Eternal Idol are my personal favorites and I couldn't recommend this album enough.
0240816250|4.0|The Second Edition of Way Beyond Monochrome goes way beyond just the basics... this dense, 500 plus page book covers every technical aspect of traditional black and white photography including such arcane information as to how to mix your own darkroom chemicals (this might turn out to be quite useful as traditional photography continues become a niche market and the supplies necessary to practice it becomes harder to casually come by).<br /><br />The first 100 pages of Way Beyond Monochrome focuses on the basics: Visualization, Print Control, and Presentation. The print control and presentations chapters are very strong useful, especially the nearly 50 pages dedicated to the presentation of the end print... an area just as important as getting the print right. As great as this book is, it lost half of the fifth star in this section... only a measly 20 pages or so dedicated to visualization, composition, etc. Yes, there are plenty of books dedicated to this topic, but this book is so committed to every other aspect of black and white photography that another 50 pages on just the process of visualizing the image long before the print.<br /><br />The next 300 pages are dedicated to the science of black and white photography... Tone Reproduction, Image Capture, Negative Control, and case studies. This is where this book really shines!

From the Zone System to critical focusing to fine exposure control to creating and maintaining a personal standard... these 300 or so pages will deliver.<br /><br />The last 100 or so pages cover what you will need in equipment and facilities, and it will provide some invaluable tips, tricks, and tools such as building your tools like a zone ruler, test strip printers.<br /><br />And, all of this material is supported by some very nice photography as well... a plus for a book like this.<br /><br />Where else did it loose the half a star? Well, this is 2010 after all and though this second edition does include new material on the digital aspect of black and white photography, it mostly focuses on it as either a bastard step child or as just a tool to be utilized sparingly. And, this is unfortunate. As awesome as traditional photography is, digital cannot be ignored. And, for this book to have been truly great, it would have been more forward looking... It should have taken digital as a standalone technology more seriously; but, it really missed an opportunity to teach the digital photography much more about the photographic science of old and how it correlates to the photographic science of new. Rightly, it points out how much manipulation Ansel Adams did with his photograph, but it missed an opportunity to correlate that to the digital darkroom that so many photographers are now utilizing exclusively.<br /><br />>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />A Guide to my Book Rating System:<br /><br />5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way.<br />4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.<br />3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.<br />2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.<br />1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.se the half a star?

0439023513|1.0|I was warned, but did not listen.  I wish I could give the book zero stars.  Many of my issues are discussed in earlier reviews such as Suzanne G. and Deniece R. Mason's.      One general complaint is the messages such as; no one can rise above their circumstances, a government can not avoid corruption, true recovery from psychological trauma is not possible, and war is necessary, but still hopeless.  OK, some of the messages I mention may be stretching it, but only because we do not see many outcomes except an insufficient epilogue.    I have read that the final book was \\"realistic\\".  I disagree, the atrocities of war could be considered realistic, but the reactions and behaviors of the main character felt off, especially the recover, or lack there of.    ***Spoilers***    For example, how could Peeta, who was tortured psychologically for weeks go on broadcast television and give vital information to save Katniss and the rebellion (the bombing of district 13), to days later trying to kill Katniss.  Was the weeks prior not enough?  The extra days did him in?  There are many more specific and general problems I find with this book.  Did the government change after Coin?  How was it changed?
B000F6YW0S|5.0|This recording had to do some work to win me over, but it did. I'm not fond of transcribed music; I like music with original instrumentation. To me, lute music is for lutes, not guitars; harpsichord is for harpsichords, not pianos. This is the first transcribed album I liked well enough to buy at the first go around. It is simply marvelous; and while there are passages where I would prefer the quickness and sharpness of a lute, I have grown to love this one. I'm not much of a classical guitar fan, either, but I finally realized why this music appeals to me: It is the work of a real composer, with length and depth and variety and purpose.    I have always thought that when J.S. Bach imagined music, he imagined it on a harpsichord. I think this weakens his string music; the endless sawing away of violins on eighth and sixteenth notes--far better suited to a harpsichord--irritates me. But with the guitar or lute, it works much better. And when Bach (through Williams) slows down and lets the melody speak... heavenly.    What Williams has done, that matches the harpsichord paradigm, is play the guitar (as others have noted) with two voices, as with the upper and lower keyboards of a harpsichord. In this I think he has gotten inside JSB's mind, and understands what Bach was doing. I have never heard anyone else pull off the two-voice effect like this. Almost three-dimensional. Marvelous.

B0018YIW4S|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this album--really, I didn't even know what to expect from UFO, since this was my first time really hearing anything they'd done. I'll admit it...That Metal Show got me to check out this album. And I'm glad I did. It really IS everything that was promised it would be: an awesome live rock album. The notes inside the CD's cover say \\"this live album captures a band firing on all cylinders,\\" and I'd say that is exactly what's here.<br /><br />Strangers in the Night feels like a culmination of something great. Each band member, it seems, has something to contribute to the overall soundscape. You can feel the energy and the attitude coming through the speakers. UFO didn't let me down. The songs were all great. If I had to pin them down: I'd say they're somewhere, to me, between, say, Humble Pie and Deep Purple. Like Deep Purple, keyboards and organ are used--but here they don't seem to be over used. Like Humble Pie the lyrics and vocals often seem to have a more soulful/bluesy approach.<br /><br />But, back to this being a live album...Strangers in the Night, what more can I say? I know this is the remastered version, so keeping that in mind...Everything sounds clean and clear--and, it seems to me, like is usual nowadays with remasters, they pumped up the low end, which I like anyway: the bass should be heard. Crowd noise is cut way down except between songs, like it should be. Yet, besides the sound, and awesome songs, there is somewhat of a candidness to Strangers in the Night. Between many of the songs (which I read wasn't included, or at least not as much of it, originally), the singer speaks to the crowd about things like the sound crew having to change out mics and such...makes it more fun and real. Anyway. Strangers in the Night, if you like live albums...buy it, even if you haven't heard of UFO before.

030726999X|4.0|\\"The Girl Who Kick's the Hornet's Nest\\" rounds out the Milleneum Trilogy.  It will go down as the greatest trey of books since The Lord of the Rings.  \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" makes it in my Top-10 of best books I have ever read.  \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" was outstanding as well.  \\"Hornet's Nest\\" was a good story that held your interest.  But it simply does not compare with suspense and plot of the preceding two novels, which were big-time page turners.  That said, it is a must read.  The court trial sequence is compelling and the ending are as good as any of Larsson's other material.  Liz Salander ranks right up there with James Bond and Mr. Clark as my most favorite literary characters.<br /><br />While there is reasonable satisfaction that the trilogy stands on its own and the Milleneum story is complete, I still hold out hope for a follow-on.  After-all, James Bond novels continued after Ian Fleming's passing (though they lacked the storytelling quality without Fleming).  Supposedly, Stieg Larsson has complete and partial manuscripts for seven additional Milleneum novels that are being withheld from print due to legal wrangling between the late author's family.  I think the world needs more Stieg Larsson.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Solid built, easy sharpening, heavy use knife that should be in anyone's day to day use or BOB. My first use of the knife was to baton wood for my Stovetec stove. I compared a camp axe, Gerber serrated camp rock and the Becker. I was more than satisfied using the Becker for my wood work. The Becker is a great knife to prep for fire, sleep or traps easy to hold and manipulate cutting notches etc...as of yet I have not been able to test its prowess on deer or fish processing. I am not a believer in carrying one knife to do it all, lose that \\"one\\" knife and you got nothing. The Becker is my heavy use knife, I have a Mora carbon, Gerber saw and a cheap camp axe. With the Becker I can do pretty much what I need to make my day easier, if you have to drop weight, what would you drop? This is not a fighting knife, but any knife in a fight is better then no knife. And for the price, my God, you can't beat it. Buy this knife and you won't regret it.
B0041QSZJM|4.0|This group and album were featured on NPR with Scott Simon last weekend.  I had sampled this album prior to hearing them on the radio and was not tempted to buy it.  After learning more about the group I did buy the album, and I'm really glad I did.    Scott Simon was moved to tears by China Jacobs singing the minimalist arrangement of White Christmas.  I would not go quite that far.  China's voice is fine but I would hardly call it The Best Voice Ever, as SS did. I myself was tremendously moved by Elohai, N'Tzor, a song I did not know.  It is absolutely gorgeous.  The voices and harmonies are beautiful.  I also woke up this morning humming Ocho Kandelikas, a song sung in the virtually extinct language of Ladino. I love the internationality of this CD, with songs in Ukrainian, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, etc.    Based on their radio interview, this group does not take themselves too seriously, but obviously they did their research and came up with some great additions to the holiday canon, as well as fresh takes on a few songs we hear all too often during the holidays (We Three Kings, Little Drummer Boy).  I like this album quite a bit, and Elohai, N' Tzor has instantly rocketed up to my all-time Top 10.
0143114085|3.0|I raced through this book in two days. Sophie Hannah, for whatever her flaws, does have a way of drawing you in to the story. Alas, like many other reviewers, when I got to the end I was left with a feeling of diappointment. Not only that, but the ending makes no sense, if we are to believe the narrator in the first part of the book. Some of the characters are two-dimensional. I didn't really buy the husband's complete reversal of character. I thought if this were more subtle it would've been more effective, more devastating. I liked the Simon character, not so much the Charlie character. However, this is Sophie Hannah's first book--both characters are in all her other books (that I've read, haven't read the newest one yet) and their relationship, and most particularly Charlie's likability improve quite a bit. If this had been the first book I read by the author, I'm not sure I would go out of my way to read her again. However, the good news is she does get better.
B0043URV8M|3.0|This score was a good accompaniment to the movie, and did an excellent job of setting the tone and enhancing the visual effects.  However, outside of the film, it is uninspiring and only suitable for the most hardcore Harry Potter fan.  You will not find any of the tracks especially memorable or something that you will hum the next day.  Yes, it is well orchestrated, but I did not find anything that I would rate more than 3 stars. There were one or two tracks that I rated 2 stars.  If you are a serious HP fan, and wish to have it for your collection, as I did, they it is a good buy (you may wish to consider the Collector's Edition in this case instead which includes a digital download as well).  Otherwise, I would pass on this soundtrack.

A perfect Chrismas gift for any German speaking Harry Potter fan...or anyone who wants to improve their German very enjoyably.
B0042816YK|1.0|I remember turning on \\"Oprah\\" when Liz Gilbert was on a few years back discussing the book version of Eat Pray Love. I could stomach about 10 minutes of her whining about how her privileged, upper-middle-class lifestyle just wasn't fulfilling her and how she had to give it up for a year to find herself. She had a good husband, she had a good job, she had a new home that she decorated just the way she wanted it, and yet, dang it all, it just wasn't quite enough. Why is that? Why is that? Ah, yes. Because she's selfish. And how cool is it that her lifestyle afforded her the luxury of finding herself during a year of travel to exotic places. Why, we all should do it. What the heck are we waiting for?<br /><br />I can recall that at the end of this \\"Oprah,\\" Liz was telling us that we can all have our own \\"Eat Pray Love\\" moment, even if it's just a ten-minute break in a quiet corner of our bedroom, away from the chaos of the kids, work, husband, and the bills. I don't know about you, but taking a break while sitting for ten minutes in a friggin' chair with the door locked while my sticky-fingered kids are pounding on said door, wondering why Mommy locked herself in her room, isn't quite the same thing as taking a year off of my life to travel to three exotic places most of us can only read about. Maybe it is the same, because enlightened Liz says so and she seems to have all the answers.<br /><br />Julia Roberts, I believe, tried to make Liz appealing/relatable, but who can relate to a woman like this? I mean, who can walk away from her marriage because her husband's, what, simply a nice guy with not enough ambition to satisfy her needs? Who can relate to a person who has the luxury of dropping out of life for a year to travel to Italy, India, and Bali? Who can relate to a woman who turns down a guy like James Franco (I know he was supposed to be a younger man, but I found Franco and Roberts to be a way awkward couple) or Javier Bardem (come on now).<br /><br />And what is it that makes Eastern religions so much more mystical and alluring to people looking to \\"find themselves\\" than, say, Christianity or Judaism? (I guess calling it \\"meditating\\" instead of \\"praying\\" is the key.)<br /><br />Well, there are some pluses to this film. The cinematography of Italy is a big plus. (India apparently is too harsh a reality to photograph much of, so all we see are interior shots and an occasional cow near a squatting boy--I guess this is supposed to symbolize the country's poverty, which is ignored throughout the film.) And the film is good for a two-hour escape from reality, because, after all, escapism is what it's all about.n religions so much more mystical and alluring to people looking to \\"find themselves\\" than, say, Christianity or Judaism?

0525951652|2.0|Like many readers who loved his previous historical novels, I eagerly awaited \\"Fall Of Giants\\". What a disappointment! The character development was minimal, and the storyline constantly segued into pages and pages about the history of World War I. I found myself lost and bored, and frequently skipped entire pages of the tedious descriptions of battles and politics. It felt as if I were reading a history book, with a few fictional stories thrown in for good measure. If you are a huge history buff, you may enjoy this novel. But if you like a good fiction read, this is not the book for you.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|This is an awesome movie. i love this movie the actors are awesome, the story is awesome and the action is awesome. kate beckinsale is beautiful and awesome. this is a great movie. and i like how they cobine cgi and practical effects looks great. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I am only rating this 1 star as I cannot give it zero stars. Let me start by saying I am a fan of the Sex and the City television series and the first film. However, I found this film to be completely lacking of any entertainment value or merit.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|This can't be the last saw not the way they left it off. if it is i'm sad saw is awesome. Saw 3d was good but the 3d was not that good i was expecting more killing in 3d, oh well the movie was awesome though. love it
B0043A0PXU|5.0|like most folks here, i've always loved annie lennox, and looked forward to the release of this disc. i do tend to like the older spirtual songs (i get very tired of santy claus stuff..although i do count him as a personal friend) having said that i have never been a big fan of silent night...until i put this c.d. in my car player headed to the gym one bright morning this week...i sat in my car and hit replay three times and was in tears before i got out..(late for aerobics..oh well...whats a  girl to do) some of the songs will be unfamiliar to a few people, but i enjoyed them.  to sum it up: even if you don't like anything else on this c.d., buy it for annie singing silent night...
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I'm always afraid that the Blu-ray version of older movies won't be any better than my cd versions so,I was pleasantly surprised when watching this version.Don't get me wrong,older movies that aren't filmed in a better format can not seem any better,this being said I would highly recommend this movie.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made.  Gosford Park is full of interesting and entertainingly naughty characters, and portrays the relationships and tensions between the various social classes, groups and personalities within the manor house.  On the surface it's constructed as a murder mystery, but the real focus is on the characters and their interactions.  The wonderful setting and the details of the functioning of the household are also very interesting to watch, and the movie is very effective at immersing you in the period.  The commentary tracks on the DVD give a wealth of background information and explanation that are essential to understanding details of the movie, and greatly enhance multiple viewings.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|This guy and this album are on a whole other level artistically.  I thought his first album was amazing...second and third showed the hints of genius, but this one is just breathtaking: dark, cocky, bleak.  Compelling and complex.  Its rap as art.  So far above others because of the complex, dark, passionate dude who created it.  He's not a role model, but then neither was Dali.  You wouldn't want him to baby sit your kids- but an outstanding artist and an amazing album.
B00005OCMR|4.0|Now this movie seems hokie, but when it was released it was years ahead of its time.  Now of course, people have a better understanding of this sort of tech, but all of it was in its infancy when this movie was created...  This is of course not to mention that this was the effective birthplace of cinematic CGI, and if nothing else is an important piece of history.
B000Y7U98W|1.0|Haven't gotten to see the movie... it could be awesome... however, I'm one of many people with a Sony Blu-ray player who can't watch the movie because I can't turn off a Picture in Picture feature. Its been a while and folks have complained to Sony. Sony says it's not their problem. I say it is Sony's problem, because I'll refuse to buy another darned thing made by Sony because of this.
159562015X|5.0|I bought this book and web assessment for my entire staff and family.  The online assessments were thought provoking and helped each person see their strengths in a new light.  I recommend it highly for those who are introspective and want to learn and grow.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|After being hooked by \\"Into Thin Air\\" by Jon Krakauer, I was anxious for other books by him. Then I found \\"Into The Wild.\\"<br /><br />This book is about an intelligent young man who wants to escape his 'pretentious' family and the shackles of society and embarks upon a two year adventure and wilderness journey. During his second year of travels, he heads toward his ultimate destination: the Stampede Trail in Alaska. There is much controversy about how equipped he was. At first, he is in his glory, living off the land, basking in the isolation. Then he becomes ill and discovers he is trapped, although had he carried maps, he could have easily hiked to safety. It is debatable as to what caused his illness.<br /><br />I have read the reviews: 'Alex' was a spoiled rich kid who made poor choices and egregious mistakes. Yes .. so he is a 'normal' young man. Did he cause his fate? Yes, he did. But that's not what this review is about. It is about the book, and the writing. That I give applause to. Riveting, thought-provoking, disturbing, fast-paced, haunting. An excellent book and one that is impossible to put down.<br /><br />I have seen seen the movie, and enjoyed it as well.<br /><br />For other gripping books, see my other reviews and my listmania list. I am an avid reader of adventure/survival books.
044654759X|5.0|Amazing book! I couldn't put it down. I didn't realize till I started reading it how it fit so much into my own person experiences. I enjoyed it very much!!
B003YFIUW8|1.0|I found reading from the child's point of view to be extremely tedious, and really not at all interesting.  Based on my love for this author's previous work, I expected so much more from her. I hope she returns to form in her next novel.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|This is the best album I have ever heard. It is seriously incredible. Do yourself the favor and buy it.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Neither I, nor my wife, had ever heard of this movie until we watched it tonight. I have an account with Netflix and did read other customer's reviews, so I ordered and received this movie on DVD today and we watched it tonight.<br /><br />The special effects were great, but the actors, known and unknown, made this movie move right along with nary a dull moment in it. I don't know how this movie was overlooked by myself or my wife for the last three years, but we are now making up for it. I'm sending the NetFlix DVD back tomorrow, but did order my own DVD of the movie from Amazon even before I took the watched DVD out of my player.<br /><br />My wife prodded me to buy our own DVD copy, and I agreed at once. This is a movie to be watched again and again. The screen play has very witty, and funny lines in it, and the visual and special effects are really something to see. Very good plot, acting, and lines.
B0000041TD|5.0|la boheme has given us many hours of pleasure.......it was very reasonably price and we will buy more cd,s from you great service and a great web site
B003YUC2FE|4.0|I really liked this product because I was able to get all three of the Toy Story movies for a good price. Being able to have a blu-ray quality, dvd, and digital copy makes it easy to watch it in anywhere I go. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to collect all 3 of the movies. The only thing I did not like is how the discs are placed in the foam. It is kind of weird to grab the disc out.
1416972250|3.0|I was hooked on this series. I thought it was very creative and well written, but am not so happy that there are going to be additional novels written after this. This was originally supposed to be a trilogy, and I think this series should have stayed that way. It should have ended with this book because everything was resolved! Valentine died, Clare and Jace ended up being together after finding out that they aren't siblings, Jocelyn's mother wakes up and finally gets together with Luke, Simon has a girlfriend and, gets over Clary, and Alec gets with Magnus. What else is there to the story?<br /><br />I was very disappointed by the foreshadowing. It was kinda obvious that Johnathan, the real Johnathan is still alive because his body was not found. So I am guessing he will replace his father Valentine as the new villain in the next books. Another thing I really disliked was when the Fairie Queen showed up and talked to Clary. She hinted that there were more secrets about Clary, and Clary herself felt like she hasn't recovered all her memories. That was annoying. What else could there be? I don't like the story being dragged on with fillers. I feel like that is what the next book will bring. Also, one thing that really ruined the ending of this novel for me was the doubts about Clary and Jace being together. Clary remember the witch Dorothea predicting that Jace would fall in love with the wrong person. That was just stupid. So after everything that happened and all that weird incest stuff, Clary and Jace are still not really a sure thing. I hated that. I am wondering what route this series will be going, and unfortunately I feel like it's going downhill if Clary is the wrong person that Jace fell in love with. I would hate it if there were new romantic interests for them in the continuation of the story. That sucks and that is mostly why I gave this 3 stars. The ending ruined it for me. I feel like the story should have ended with this very book and not with gloomy foreshadowing.owing.
073937771X|4.0|I expected this book to be horrible from most of the reveiws I've read but it was still suspenseful and kept my interest.  The legal parts explaining how the Swedish legal system worked were too detailed, repetitive, and uninteresting.  You just wanted to skip this part and get back to the story.  I think there were too many story lines going but this was a minor detraction.  Overall not bad for the ending of a trilogy.
B001SGEUNI|2.0|Why this band gets rated so high.<br /><br />What you have is a talented band, a talent lead singer, but they are handcuffed by the fact that they sound better live than in the studio, and this is nothing more than over produced pop rock.<br /><br />It's a shame that \\"It's Not You\\", sounds better on the One And Done EP, than the studio version on this release. They offer nothing new with this debut, you have only two decent songs out of 11, and lyrically it's a poor album.<br /><br />Now this isn't even close to being heavy metal music, unless some reviewers are comparing it to the crap Bad English or Nelson released as heavy metal music.<br /><br />I don't hear the comparison to Pat Benatar, Heart, or Lita Ford, but rather Avril Lavigne due to Lzzy Hale doing that tough-bad girl thing, Sandi Saraya, or the'80's metal singer Fiona are closer to what Halestorm sounds like.<br /><br />Due to the sexual oriented songs, you could compare them to Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, but even that's pushing it, due to the poor lyrics, the fact Joan's just to good of a singer, and the simple fact that they are a true Rock'n Roll band.<br /><br />Save your hard earned money, I paid $22.24 for there debut, along with the One And Done EP, and I wouldn't recommend this band. They'll end up in the used bin at my local Fye store.<br /><br />It's just a shame that Halstorm in the studio, sounds nothing like they do live, and if they ever can achieve that on a studio release, they'll be huge.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|Honestly, I have nothing to compare this album to since this review is coming from someone who is experiencing Mr. Grobin for the first time. I find it very solemn and serene overall. I think he is a wonderfully gifted man with fantastic vocal range. No, I am not annoyed by any of his falsettos that are on this cd, as some people have remarked on here.    Now that he has shared his wonderful gift with us, I hope he finds a love of his own. He is currently single and mentioned it in his USA today video interview. Thank you Mr. Grobin.    PS I don't watch Oprah even though I am a woman, nor do I watch any of those shows where women sit around and talk...it's annoying to me. BUT, I can see why they would recommend this.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|I have listened to this new album a dozen or more times now. I have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current. I even pulled out the DVD \\"albums\\" and gave them a listen as well. \\"Closer\\" without question is his very best album - the most solid performance from track to track. \\"Illuminations\\" is without question the worst. There is no other artist who I listen to more over time than Mr. Groban. His songs have soothed away many stressful moments and days. His voice is unlike any other. He is talented and a gifted singer and song writer. Yet this does not change the fact that this new album is hands down the worst. In some ways, I wish it was never been released. For it tarnishes his previous accomplishments. I do not blame Mr. Groban for this, even though he chose his producer, but I do blame his advisors and most of all, the producer. Rick Rubin is no David Foster. Even though I am not a personal fan of David Foster - his arrogance is not very becoming. His ability to but together solid albums and attach songs to the right performer for the right \\"hit\\" is without question impeccable. And with this said, maybe he deserves to be arrogant. Mr. Groban does have the ability to write some very moving songs. The best ones have been in collaboration with other more experienced writers. Redirection is needed for the next album. Heck, if it was me, I would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing less than his very best. Many of the standards which Mr. Groban has sung off albums in various performance venues could lay the ground work for such an album. Yet there has to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage. This is where the experienced writers in the rock, pop and classical venue could bring works together to pull off an album unlike any other. In the end, this is just my opinion, among many starry eyes Grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour. Let's hope he performs only two or three songs from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishments and those outstanding performances you have added along the way at many of your venues. I wanted this album to be better than any of the previous albums. My hopes were high thus why I am so disappointment by this collection of songs. Without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album. This does shine through despite the haphazard collection of songs that make up \\"Illuminations\\". I now look forward to his next album knowing full well Mr. Groban  has decades of music yet to bring to all of us to enjoy.
B003FSTN6Q|1.0|Bonjour,  J'aimerai tellement visionner la suite de la 4ème saison en français. D'ailleurs pourquoi les 4 premières saisons passent bien dans mon lecteur DVD et pas la suivante.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|you know why your buying this and if not, just get it. you wont be disappointed. not for kids though
0374158460|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. The characters were, to me, believable. Sometimes a little over the top, but overall very fun to read.  It made me thing of them, or parts of them, as so true in human nature. As someone else wrote I love them becuase of their problems, not in spite of them.   It is worth reading.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|for the price these should sound a bit better. they are good for just regular gaming and chat. for games like online FPS where you need to hear foot steps forget it. the foot steps sound like they are coming in every direction and the proximity sounds like they are always right next to you.

B004529NKC|4.0|This film is about university freshmen participating in various breakdance showdowns and competitions. The plot is simply about young people getting together to dance, and caring for one another. Of course there is some heavy rivalry and some betrayal. But in the end everyone matures and develops quite nicely.<br /><br />But the real attraction of this film is the dancing which is really an advanced freeform mixture of acrobatics, gymnastics and breakdancing - DO NOT TRY SOME OF THESE MOVES AT HOME.<br /><br />There is an abundance and a wide variation of:<br /><br />- head spins<br />- windmills<br />- flips<br />- hand stands<br />- helicopter spins<br />- robotic movements<br />- leg contortions<br /><br />The charged, synchronized and meticulously choreographed routines serve to excite the imagination. It is a healthy way for youths to spend their time and extra energies. I am just simply amazed at some of the routines and dance movements that are presented in this film. They make it look easy, but I am sure that it takes a tremendous amount of effort to really get it looking so good.
B00428ZRFE|2.0|Its a ok cd...this one is more on the pop culture side!! She didnt give herself a break from the previous album. I only paid 6.99 for it so I guess it was worth it then on my behalf.
B004E9CFZG|5.0|This series so far has been great.  A lot of people don't realize that this story revolutionized zombies movies as a graphic novel, so to see it as a series was incredible for me.  Decent acting, great story, awesome plot twists, and believe it or not a little insight into the human condition.
0553805371|3.0|In their quest for the \\"Theory of everything\\", the authors ignored the \\"Theory of nothing\\", i.e. Nothing can create itself.  At one time in history, philosophers pondered reality, scientists measured it, and priests invented strange gods to account for the unknown.  Today, serious scientists ponder reality and invent strange forces to account for the unknown.  I've always admired Stephen Hawking's intelligence and insight, and respected Mlodinow's previous work, Drunkard's Walk, but this collaboration seems to have an agenda to replace possibility of \\"Intelligent Design\\" with the impossibility of \\"Spontaneous Creation\\".  Multiple gods have been replaced with multiple universes without any physically measured evidence or justification.
B00009YOQW|5.0|This is a well made, safe, non-toxic, sustainable solid wood drum. It has a nice tone -- not too loud-- that is pleasant to the ear and loud enough for the kids. We have several drums and this is our favorite. Although the kids, especially the baby love the cymbal on the Plan Toys Band, those drums are nearly as satisfying to play or listen too.
B0041HU440|5.0|Just wanted to add my 5 stars to a great cd with amazing vocals. No fillers as every song seems to have a purpose...To rope you in after a few listens. Hopefully this sells enough to interest UC to do another!
1933308087|5.0|This should be in your home for the inspiration and joy it brings. I use this big, beautiful book every day. Thanks to Amazon I purchased it at almost half the original price! I borrowed this book from a public library so many times that I realized I needed it available 24/7. This is a beautiful book for coffee table, bedside and is an unforgettable gift.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is a great movie. I found it hilarous and will watch it over and over again at different times. It has a great cast of characters that bring back some memories.
1579125549|4.0|Pretty good book of tactical puzzles, covering a pretty wide range of skill levels (from mate-in-ones on up) presented in such a way that it helps drill mating patterns into your head.  If you're playing below master level, its my firm believe that focusing on tactics provides the quickest path to improvement, so tactical puzzle books are quite valuable, and this is a pretty decent one.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I really liked the compilation CD, some very interesting duets (especially the one with her and Willie Nelson).  I have always loved that song, perfect for Christmas! I love that she mixed it up with some of the coolest hip hop artists out there.  Though I don't think that is Norah Jones' best, I liked the idea of singing with some of the greatest artists.  My favorite songs are #2 \\"Turn Them\\", #11 \\"Little Lou, Prophet Jack, and Ugly John, and #17 \\"More than This\\". *I am a member of One2OneNetwork and I'm part of the Norah Jones review project.
B00445JSX2|5.0|My favorite band since 1984!!  This dvd is not as spectacular as 101, Devotional or Touring the Angel, but it is awesome.  I saw Depeche Mode on this tour so it brought back great memories.  The songs are timeless and sound better on every live dvd they release.  I purchased the deluxe version  because you get an extra dvd that has extra performances, a documentary, 2 cds and the videos from the Tour of the universe cd that were not shown on MTV. I have seen Depeche Mode many times, and this was one of the best tours they have ever embarked on.  Next to meeting them, which I did, the shows were an amazing experience.  I recommend this dvd to anyone who is a true DM fan!!
229033295X|4.0|I was happy to be able to purchase this book in french as every body is raving about it in France. It was expensive but it helped me at the time.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|This novel grabbed my attention immediately and held it almost completely throughout the book for various reasons.  As the story progressed I went from being transfixed with horror and fear and helplessness to being intrigued and even fascinated by the turn of events.  I have a stomach dropping feeling about it that doesn't detract from my being held captive by it's pages.
B002IVLH60|5.0|This is an AMAZING album, its cool that Pearl Jam self produced this album, (which is why its expensive, and made in the UK), i'm very glad that Brenden O'Brien mixed and produced this album, as his work is always top notch. NOW, on to the music itself. Each song on this album is individual and has a personality, and it just has a fresher Pearl Jam feel to it, I think its just as amazing as any of their other albums.
0061537969|5.0|A quick read that will pull at your heart-strings and think of your dog in a different way.... Fabulous book.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|I was prepared not to like this  CD, as I love Nora Jones, but... by herself.  Instead, I got a surprise! I loved the mix of her wonderful voice with all the different styles and kinds of music! A great CD to listen to and relax :)
158270208X|5.0|I wrote in my book [[ASIN:1452846715 Mental Tricks for Endurance Runners and Walkers]] about the value of keeping a gratitude diary. The Secret Gratitude Book is my favorite tool for this. Yes, you could type your gratitude statements on a computer every day. But there is something extra-meaningful about the kinesthetic process of writing your statements with a pen. And, yes, you could buy any blank-pages book to use in place of The Secret Gratitude Book. But there is something extra-rewarding about writing your gratitude statements in a book as attractive as this, with a different comment about gratitude on every pair of pages. I love, too, the \\"Gratitude Now\\" and \\"Gratitude Intentions\\" page pairs. These paired pages make me focus on what I have now *and* on what I am in the process of attracting. I keep buying this book because it works. So here is my suggestion: Buy one copy of this book. Complete a pair of pages every day until the end of the book. See whether your life has changed.
0439023521|5.0|I used to love Stephen King.  I miss the way he wrote.  These books reminded me of his earlier style and have gone through them in no time.  They flowed well and never got boring.  Quick, read these before Hollywood destroys them with their anorexic, uninteresting actors! :)
B00275EHJQ|5.0|Toys story 3 is a move that not only continues the great story of the first two movies that we fell in love with ,but adds a lot to the Toy story movies.  It has a great story and great characters.  This movie has something for everyone and once again the Pixar team hit a home run.
0316098337|5.0|This amazing book, written by a Canadian woman, covers all the bases.  It's insightful, exciting, moving and A GREAT READ!  I couldn't put it down.

B00061HJ4S|5.0|I only rated the durability at one star because it is a glue model kit and not made to be played with. It is for display purposes. It provides enough of a challenge to assemble without being frustrating. Parts fit together nicely. Very pleased with this model kit.
B003KUSUSQ|2.0|My daughter ordered this CD - it came promptly - but she was very disappointed when she found out it was the \\"clean\\" version.  Many of the words are bleeped out, and it's almost useless.  No where on the description did it indicate this.  Thanks.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I would like to preface this with a plea to Michael Patrick King: PLEASE stop making sequals to one of the greatest shows ever on HBO before you make me and many others start hating our \\"girls.\\"  I have been a fan of the original series since it started, enough to buy the entire series and watch it from beginning to end at least twice a year. When the first movie came out, i was cautiously looking forward to seeing it, and after having done so, i can't say that I felt it was something I needed to see, but wasn't necessarily bored or offended either. I recently bought \\"Sex 2\\" months and months after its theater run, which gives an indication of my eagerness to see it. I regretted having done so. It was lousy. LOUSY script, totally unworthy of a series that had such a history of often brilliant  and always entertaining writing. I am not remotely into the \\"chick flick\\" genre, but \\"Sex\\" the series witty writing turned it into so much more than that. In \\"2\\",  there IS no witty writing, nor any story. It has all the look, albeit glitzy and over the top with production costs i'm sure, of a film made to make quick bucks on its weekend run, and subsequent quick bucks in rentals. Also missing was the  charm that made us fall in love with our \\"girls\\" to begin with. They are now spoiled materialistic unsatisfied brats that are never without designer frocks and stilettos, even when walking around their ridiculously opulent NYC pads. They may be wearing Manolo's, but having gained the world, their souls are missing. Their elitist and totally unrealistic (to but a few) lifestyles are nothing but obnoxious in this film. Perhaps Mr. King equates all this spoiled so-called glamour as equivilant to Fred and Ginger dancing off to Rio to cheer up the soup line folks in the depression, but fantasy is one thing,  in- your- face extravagance with characters we feel nothing for is another. It doesn't work. When our girls were looking for love and that perfect guy, they were characters that people could still identify with, and still deeply human. Now, as seen in this film,  it's like watching aliens. Speaking of aliens, the long time costume designer who looks like Betsy Johnson's mother on crack should be forced to wear the Jaclyn Smith collection for the rest of her life for creating the monstrosities the ladies wear in this film. She has succeeded in making our lovely girls look as unattractive as possible, sometimes bizarrely so. I have always defended Sarah J.P's distinctive and charming physical appearance, and took offense when she was criticised for not having the generically acceptable cookie cutter bland looks that American's seem to favor. Well, in this film, she has been made to look so atrocious that it's hard to defend. In the one particular get up she wears to Stanford's and Anthony's obnoxiously opulent, charmless, loveless wedding, she is wearing some sort of headdress that makes her look like  one of the gargoyles climbed down from The Dakota and crashed the reception,  she looks unbelievably unattractive. WHAT were these people thinking? And..the gay wedding. What one expected, after the initial shock of seeing the unlikely pairing of Stanford and Anthony, was a touching ceremony perhaps,  always with some humor, of course. That was a missed opportunity, and all we got were two obnoxious, materialistic queens who seemed to be making a business arrangement, making sure to leave an amendment for \\"cheating.\\"  Throwing in the ultimate celebrity gay collectable, Liza Minelli, doing a cover of \\"Single Ladies\\"  only makes it more improbable, and her performance is just plain creepy.  But, back to the \\"fashion.\\" ...\\"Carrie\\" said in the original series at one point..\\"It's time for ladies our age to cover it up..\\" and the producers should have taken heed to that advice. Seeing Kim Catrell, an attractive lady who is obviously not 25 anymore, dressed in tacky body baring clothing that only accentuates her maturing body, is not enticing and onlydistasteful. Completely unflattering, and to be blunt, she  looks simply like an aging , desperate hooker, whom we should pity, when you don't want to slap her. All the girls (other than the Miranda character) are also the victims of some overzealous make-up fairy, they all look like drag queens, with make-up by \\"Home Depot\\"...and look much older than their actual years...they border on hideous. All I will say about their obnoxious behaviour in the Arab Republic is that it is offensive in more ways than one can keep track of. They do try and wrap it all up in the end with Carrie supposedly realizing what's really important, but by then, it's too late to salvage this mess, and the viewer only wants to  \\"Escape From New York.\\" This is a completely atrocious movie and a sad legacy for a series that had such charm, heart, and evoked such affection from so many people. All the best shows, Mary Tyler Moore, Six Feet Under, and many others, usually were lucky, and knew when to quit. Unfortunately, the \\"Sex & The City\\" powers that be did otherwise. So...As I did with any of the sequals after \\"Aliens\\"...this one too will go in the trash where it belongs, and will be conveniently forgotten, leaving me to remember those adorable ladies as I would like to, not as they were portrayed in this piece of gilded garbage.

B002ZG980U|5.0|This is a great movie. You know why? It is a dream within a dream! Okay, this movie is very confusing at first for me. I did not get it until I watched it for the second time. I really like the storyline of this movie though. Not only does it provide great knowledge of what goes next, but it also has great actors. This movie is one of the best movies in 2010 if not the best. Since this movie is going to be out on blueray, if you have a blue ray player buy it because seeing it in higher definition is definitely worth it. Trust me, you will get addicted to this movie once you watch it!
1439177783|5.0|Portia has written a wonderful book which I am sure will help people for all different reasons and not just people with eating disorders or people finding it difficult to come out. Its more then this its a book of self discovery an awakening. I found this book difficult to put down once I started it and it was easy reading. Well done Portia your a brilliant author and I hope you find the courage to write more.
B0042AGNC8|5.0|This Blu-ray title has been around for a little while, but finally got released as a solo disc (rather than a box set) in mid-November.  You only get the movie (no extra disc with special features).  I already own the DVD version, so I could probably go back and watch the extras.  From what I understand, the box set version also didn't have any extras.  If it did, they probably weren't recorded in HD.  Basically, it's not worth deducting a star if you know you're getting just the feature film.    If you haven't seen a Blu-ray movie before, there's really no way to describe it with only words.  Assuming you have an HDTV (720p or above), and connect your player with an HDMI cable, the picture will definitely be an upgrade from what you're used to on any DVD (even using upconversion).  The 24 frames per second (make sure your TV can accept those signals) makes a difference.  Colors will be improved.  Faces and clothing look very crisp and detailed.    This movie was supposedly filmed in a 1.85:1 ratio, yet filled the whole screen on my TV (which has a 1.78:1 ratio).  That's rare for a Blu-ray movie (a 2.35:1 ratio will show the familiar \\"black bars\\").  I can't comment on the HD sound, since my receiver only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1 (DVD quality).  You can still get good sound with Dolby Digital on most Blu-ray discs.    The movie itself is one of my favorites, since I can relate to Peter feeling nerdy, shy and awkward.  They did a great job of developing the characters before jumping into any heavy action (which comes mostly toward the end).    Overall, a great buy, and at a lower price than most newer releases (which usually sell for $25+ in retail stores).
B000XUBFE2|5.0|if you are looking for well crafted story with an interesting perspective. you must read the book thief.  death, the narrator, tells the story of a young girl in nazi germany that is saved (literally) by books.  zusak shows, both with the book's plot and his command of language, how important words can be.  a must read.
B000PKX2KA|1.0|I just received the BU-353 today (December 4, 2010) and loaded the Mac OS 10 drivers and software on the included CDROM. It had everything you needed for both the Macintosh and Windows machines. The drivers were identical to those available from your prolific drivers referenced elsewhere in the reviews. Set 4800 baud rate and NMEA for your data type on your Mac mapping and navigation software and be sure to select the correct comm port for the GPS receiver. I use the BU-353 on both the Intel Mac Pro desktop and on my Macbook Pro with National Geographic State Topo maps and it works perfect. Extremely fast to acquire satellites and produces very accurate position even sitting at my desk inside my house or inside my truck or motorhome.    The included instruction setup card is very detailed and complete for getting the BU-353 up and running on the Macintosh, as well as, with Windows machines.  I was running a Bluetooth GPS before buying the BU-353.  I prefer the USB connection because it is powered from the laptop and I don't have to worry about keeping it charged like I do the Bluetooth.  Acquires within seconds from inside my vehicles and my house.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|After watch the best regeneration sequence since the 4th Doctor (Tom Baker) regenerated into Peter Davidson. I didn't think anyone could replace David Tenant, but Matt Smith has proved me wrong. This season was very good and Amy Pond is another in a long line of Companions that you can't help but enjoy. Buy this product and enjoy...along with the video extras, well worth it.
B000007T1M|4.0|This is a crazy album. I couldn't believe that it's one of the 1001 Records that You Should Hear Before You Die after my first listen of it. The lyrics of System of A Down's first album are intriguing because they're unique and don't make since at first; they're poetic. The booklet has weird art and includes lyrics to all the songs along with footnotes to a few of them. Here's the songs:<br /><br />1)\\"Suite-Pee\\" is the track I skip over because it offends christianity.<br />2)\\"Know\\" is a catchy strong song.<br />3)\\"Sugar\\" was a hit. \\"The Kombucha mushroom people...\\" When it goes to the chorus, the rhythm is strong, but when the verses are heard, there's a fun guitar rhythm, and then the song ends fast with crazy drum work.<br />4)I didn't like \\"Suggestions.\\"<br />5)\\"Spiders\\" is a weird sounding slower track. Last of the two hits from this CD.<br />6)\\"DDevil\\" is a short interesting song.<br />7)\\"Soil\\" has the most complicated beat on this album. The repeated lines at the end are catchy.<br />8)\\"War?\\" is a fast-paced fighting song.<br />9) \\"Mind\\" wasn't that good. Starts off mellow, then gains strength. A lot of yelling included.<br />10)\\"Peephole\\" is catchy and fast. You can actually hear the lyrics mentioned on this one. \\"Don't you ever get stuck in the sky.\\"<br />11) \\"CUBErt\\" has an interesting beat. Fast drums.<br />12)\\"Darts\\" sounds okay.<br />13)\\"P.L.U.C.K.\\" features yelling and is fast-paced.<br /><br />Overall, this is an intriguing album and thus is worth checking out. Some of the relative lyrics are out of this world. For the most part, the rhythms off System of a Down's debut are fast mingled with yells and weird but creative manipulations of vocals at times. Also, on the back of the album, there's a paragraph of a warning that encourages its readers to take action. Released in 1998, this album was produced by Rick Rubin. AMERICAN.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is a wonderful update of a timeless fictional character. Holmes as a young man in our current time! I really enjoyed all three of these mini movies and am looking forward to more. The inclusion of the original pilot was a plus that came with this set. This would be a great stocking stuffer for any holmes fan.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Crazy, fun movie starring Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, a slacker/heartbreaker, who meets the girl of his dreams Ramona Flowers played excellently by Mary Elizabeth Winstead.  In order to date Ramona, Scott must defeat her seven evil ex's who come from differing backgrounds and gender(her sexy phase as Scott puts it).  The movie is like a living comic with funny villains, special effects and comedy.  Kieran Culkin stars as Wallace, Scott's gay roomate, and scene stealer.  The movie may seem silly and dumb to some but it's a romantic comedy and come on, it's just a movie!  Based on the comic, it's a fun movie that will make you laugh.
B00275EHJG|3.0|As much as I enjoyed the first two Toy Story movies. I just couldn't get into this one. I have heard of people crying during this movie. But for me it did present closure to this story. Good Bye Woody, Good Bye Buzz, thanks for the good memories
B000JML7EC|5.0|Hellow fellow readers. I am Caleb. I`m 11 years old and I love this book! B ut do you know what`s better? THE ORIGINAL!!!!!!!!!!!! My Nana has the original book and it`s sighed! The original has a few alterations but it`s just as good. I Hope Amazon have or are reading this because the original is so much better, so changing it will most likely sell better than this one.
0307269760|2.0|These short stories are the type that reach no conclusion or make any point at all.  I prefer stories that seem to have a reason for being and these don't.  It made for dull reading.
0465092764|4.0|This book is at times not an easy read for the uninitiated but it is ultimately very rewarding. Everytime Peter Woit touches on something, he does it in an upatronising fashion that gives you a very clear sense of the subject. He also provides a disenchanted view of modern academia.     However what I liked most about this book is probably that although it is an unrelenting (and very convincing) attack on string theory, the attack is never ad personam. Woit has obviously the utmost respect for the best researchers in the field (and gives a very interesting account of the achievements of Ed Witten, probably the brightest physicist of our time, and one of the main supporters of string theory), which is not a common gift in the world of academia, with its addiction to name-calling. Highly recommended, especially to physics undergrads and graduate students.
B003WSFXKY|1.0|Talk about disappointing. Real poor production without any of his normal riffs that would make you smile.    Most of the cuts sound like the \\"guests\\" singing along with a wedding band.    Sorry, I can't tell you much else because I listened to it once and will never play it again.  I didn't even bother ripping it to my music library.
B0031RS7X6|4.0|not going to bore u with facts from the book but my review on it.... laugh out loud funny... the most creative book i read in a while and i loved every part of it... characters were good and u could picture them. story line was funny as. its your typical happy ending girly book. perfect to read for thoes rainy saturday afternoons. highly recommend this book
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Bought this for my sister for an early Christmas present. Came quickly and in new condition! Thanks again for the movie!
B003DO13O2|5.0|Having read the liner notes where Mike Olfield talk s about how arduous the recording process was for this follow up to Tubular Bells, I am struck at the point where he says his heart wasn't in to making this album. I am of the opinion that if his heart was into making this album, my head may have exploded when I first listened to Hergest Ridge as it is magnificent! This piece is not a retread of Tubular Bells, but rather the testament of Mike's retreat from the limelight TBells thrust his way. Whereas TBells was a lot of rock and roll and a small amount of Celtic influences, this piece is a lot of Celtic influences and a small amount of rock and roll. Both are amazingly represented however.
0061808121|5.0|I ordered this for a middle school language arts class.  It beats reading it to the students or the students reading it aloud.  This story has many words the students do not know and having the tape is great.  THis came to me in excellent condition.  No problems.  I did sign up for expediated delivery  but it somehow did not happen.  Took a little longer to get to me than I wanted.  Think it was a computer glitch since I ordered 2 item and the other expediated.
B00433QE3M|4.0|Carlos decided to have some fun on this album.      \\"Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time\\"    The name is misleading, I think.  These, of course, are not typically regarded as the pinnacle of guitar wailing.  These are fun, recognizable tunes.  I think this is an album that you should appreciate because they are good, lasting songs, and Carlos has some great vocalists to really deliver.      Purchase this album if you enjoy the songs within and want to hear Carlos' interpretation.  If you're expecting the most impressive guitar playing, don't.    I think the disgruntled reviewers purchased believing it was something that it isn't meant to be.
1439133948|3.0|I am a big fan of LMB. I have read everything she has written, and I love the Vorkosigan universe. That being said, I would give this book 3 1/2 stars. There were some interesting themes explored, but this was a very dark book. To me, the most interesting \\"character\\" was Nefertiti! I think the story was hurt by the fact that Miles was off on his own, and none of the wonderful supporting characters were in the book until the ending. I suppose that's why I felt so cheated. This book is the first since a long break in the series, and I just wanted...more. To reopen this world, and then abruptly end the book the way she did with no other character contact seemed cruel. Of course, that was somewhat in keeping with the books themes, but still...it was depressing. Sorry to sound obscure, but I can't really elaborate and stay spoiler free.
B0002EXH40|5.0|I'm just starting to get into Megadeth's music, so you can say that I'm a beginner. Before Youthanasia, the only songs I heard from the band were \\"Prince of Darkness,\\" \\"Foreclosure of a Dream,\\" and \\"Promises.\\" This week, I decided to listen to one of their albums from beginning to end. Let's just say that I'm officially a fan. Youthanasia is an awesome album from Megadeth. I've heard that this is lighter and more melodic than their previous albums, so I won't comment on that. I will say, though, that these songs are beautiful, haunting, and full of meaning. \\"Addicted to Chaos\\" and \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" are my two top favorites: they're catchy and very emotional. \\"Train of Consequences\\" and \\"The Killing Road\\" are also superb. Actually, every song on Youthanasia is brilliant beyond belief. Youthanasia is an excellent album, and hopefully I'll be able to explore Megadeth's other albums soon.<br /><br />Grade: 9.9/10
B003NFM3JK|1.0|I was excited to watch this on DVD and was thinking about buying it.  Glad I waited to watch it first.  Honestly, they made Scrooge so grotesque, I had trouble even wanting to look at his face.  Not a good way to start off a movie.  And it was very morbid, very vivid and went over the top on anything that could be the least bit scary.  This is a horror movie.  It's great if you like that kind of thing, but I much prefer to have a little bit of Christmas cheer mixed into A Christmas Carol.  Yes, the storyline does have ghosts and scary parts in all versions, but this would definitely terrify children.  After about 25 minutes in, my husband begged me to please turn it off and we put on one of my favorites, The Muppet's Christmas Carol which is just brilliant, heart warming, funny, pleasant to watch and has great music as well.  I recommend that one over this any day.  I can't imagine even wanting to see the entire thing.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|You don't have to be a sci-fi nut or a Firefly fan to enjoy this movie. It's great as a stand-alone film. Rarely are action movies this good. This movie is exciting, but it also has substance- a good story line.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I lovee this moviee ! 5 mins after it started i was already sayingg i was gonna buy it when it came out and surely enuff i was rite! christina and cher killd it they r soooo amazingg ! i will def be getting myy copyy as soon as its on dvd ! :D
B00418NVMQ|4.0|Got home with my Halestorm Live in Philly DVD/CD combo.  Was all excited, couldn't wait to show my wife what these guys, especially Lzzy, are like live (she unfortunately hasnt seen them yet).  Popped the DVD in, started the concert..........WTF?????????? They edited Lzzy's trademark intro to Its Not You!!  WHY???      For those of you that havent seen them live, the intro is usually twice the length with tremendous vocal acrobatics by Lzzy before they go into It Not You.  For some reason, they edited this intro, essentially cutting it in half. Very, very disappointing.    The rest of the DVD is amazing. Great production, you can hear all instruments clearly. I am not a huge fan of the quick editing that all concert DVDs have these days, but they all do it.    This would have been a perfect 5 stars if they didnt cut the intro.  Otherwise, its amazing! A great representation of their live show for current fans and a great introduction for future fans.  Lets face it, if you are a fan of rock music and pop this in and dont like it, something is wrong with you....    Being from Philly, I have seen this band about 10 times now, going back to when they were touring and recording their EP.  They have come a long way and never disappoint.    But why cut one of the highlights of their show......why
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Pixar has done it again. The new movie is as good as the first and entertains our grandchildren for hours. I especially liked the digital version included with the set so I can play the movie on my Ipad for the kids.
0307594777|5.0|It's unfortunate that Stieg Larsson didn't live to know what a genius he was in the mystery writing category. The Millennium series is the best I've ever read.  Each ending made by scream for the next book.
B000002H7I|2.0|Looks like I'm in the minority on this one, but I'll say my piece anyway.   Crossroads, the title track, is why I bought this CD. I heard it on the radio and decided right away I'd have to own it.   I should have bought the MP3 track and saved myself the trouble of downloading the entire CD onto my computer. I deleted every one of the other tracks after listening to them. My reasons:    A) Tracks 2-9 all sound the same, and none of them sounds anything like the title track. Not even a little.     B) They're badly mixed, with the volume difference between voice and music hugely out of balance. If you turn it up loudly enough to hear the music, the voice is overpowering. If you turn it down low enough to be able to enjoy Tracy's incredible voice, you can barely hear the music.   C) Along the same line as 'B', the music in 2-9 is minimal, barely audible acoustic guitar with little to no accompaniment.     Very disappointed. Still glad I have track one though.
0783225857|4.0|This is my wife's favorite movie and novel.  We had the VHS tape but wanted to upgrade to the DVD.  Great movie.  Gregory Peck captures the main character, Atticus Finch, to perfection.  The Academy Award was richly deserved.  Harper Lee was able to capture the mood of the time in this novel.  Great family entertainment.  A must see!!
B0047SF41G|4.0|I've been enjoying the Alien & Predator series of movies since I was about 7 years old. I love them both, despite some questionable choices in some of their creations. The most despised of (which I still occasionally watch) being AVP Requiem. I waited a third of my life to see Aliens square off against Predators, and while the 1st AVP was acceptable (and only acceptable), the teen drama in AVP Requiem made me wish no one would survive the movie, including the writers. This solo Predator outing could have just as easily gone the same way. Thank God it did not. Yes, it copies some of the original, but the knowledge of the original was openly, in dialogue, mentioned in the movie and utilized as learned behavior by the characters, not just a carry-over by the writers. I would rate this one higher than Predator 2, but I still love the vibe and mystery of the original more. PS: the thing I disliked the most is the \\"spikey dogs\\" and the almost afterthought character of Lawrence Fishburn. 10 seasons on the run and his character only gives drawn-out explanations of what we already know then gets killed trying to screw everyone else over... unexpected yes, good use of the character no... Now if these guys could try their hand at a GOOD AVP sequel, I might actually be happy...
B003EYVXSW|1.0|Thankfully, I only borrowed this.  The plot starts out looking like a neat science fiction story, but two thirds in it turns into a sick horror movie.  It's at if the writer couldn't think of a real science-based outcome and resorted to some twisted sex, unrealistic mutation, and lots of blood.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|Surprise, surprise: This set -- already an inferior product because of truncated episodes and lopped off widescreen -- is loaded with faulty discs. I will be returning it ASAP. I only gave it one star because you can't post a review without a star rating.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Only thing I have a issue with is the count down timer.  Its capable of up to 99hr59min 59sec but it set to 5 min  So far haven't found a way to change it, seeing how I would rarely use it  Its no big deal.   It has 29 buttons that can be programed in 3 different modes.  This give you 78 assigned functions per program.  So playing WOW I can have a Melee character, switch to Ranged and finally select   a healer and not have to change a program.  So this is more thought out definitely more rugged than Microsoft's Strategic Commander.   Another plus it can be programed to use any application that can use one key commands as shortcuts.   So in fact its use is only limited by your imagination.  Have fun
B003TML0VO|2.0|These are guitar classics, but Santana was not in the music.  Some of the vocals just stank, not my style and not Santana's style either.
B002WY65W4|4.0|Seeing as the zombie genre is alive and well ( ha ha get it!), this particular film does a great job incorporating all the ingredients for a flesh eating, double tap dat, zombie comedy.<br /><br />If you like zombie movies such as 28 Days Later and others, this film takes the gore and horror plus a healthy dose of comedy.
B003L1ZWG2|4.0|Story:  A somewhat unique take on the horror/suspense/thriller genre. There were genuine moments where I felt for the main characters and their plight. The first time watching this movie really grabs you, subsequent viewings a bit less (as you already know the outcome) but it still remains a striking story even after multiple viewings    Video:  very good. Lots of fine detail to be seen, especially in the snowy landscape. There are some scenes at night but delineation remains strong with very good black levels. No detail gets lost because of overshadowing blacks.    Audio:  I thought I was there! The lossless audio track really uses the seperate channels effectively to simulate the sound of wind blowing through the room or the sound of animals coming from a certain direction. People with a home theater will enjoy this one!    Overall: if you're looking for a horror/suspsene/thriller movie that isn't of the 13 in a dozen variety, this might be something for you. Strong video and audio complete the package
1597801585|5.0|This is a brilliant read. If you like near future, alternate reality/history, dark SciFi, then this is one of the best. Highly recommended.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This is a great read if you can get through the first half of the book.  Larsson laid his groundwork methodically and carefully, almost to a fault.  I put the book down and read others several times during the first half.  It is a testament to the writing, though, that I kept coming back.  However, once I hit the halfway mark, I couldn't put it down, finishing it in one sitting.  Larsson created vivid characters, and once the story really began moving, I was so glad to know what I needed to in order to follow the action.<br /><br />Definitely a reader's book.
B002ZG981E|4.0|I don't usually like to write reviews, but very few flicks caught my eye this year, Inception being one of them. This won't be a full-fledged review but rather, a few words shared to those who weren't fond of the movie, with some discussion on those that loved it. Whilst not perfect, the film is solid in the fact that all the elements have come together into what makes films well...films. Think about it. The groundwork is there, it clearly has careful planning. The plot revolves around the interaction between the dream world and reality, the actors are engaged in various sequences and instances to help support said plot, and the special effects assist in viewing pleasure, supporting the actors. It's as if we were writing an essay, with a main idea/theory, supporting and minor details to back it up: Well-rounded.     Even if you disliked the film, it shouldn't be difficult to realize that all the elements were in place, and throughout the movie, scenes were implemented with care. When Joseph Gordon-Levitt was trapped in that second instance of the ending dream sequence, trying to get that kick in order for them to wake up in that moment...they kept the physics intact. You see, Nolan managed to bend the rules of physics without breaking them. No gravity, bombs used on an elevator to get the kick, it was truly brilliant. Think outside the box here. It's not a matter of attempting to be intelligent or being too serious/dramatic, whatever you believe the film to be. It's more-so regarding the science fiction bits and pieces placed in the film, and extending beliefs with ideas and experiments (again, without breaking reality's laws). Nothing seemed too out of place in this film, as long as we paid attention, we knew what was the dream and what was the reality. We also knew the extent of these dreams were, how far people realized they were in a dream, that current setting placed, etc..     The only bit that wasn't thoroughly explained was the device used to place everyonewithin someone's dream. I imagine a Matrix effect here. It's just plugging into the same database/server, through use of a wired device, heh. But that's where the Sci-Fi part comes into play again. I'll agree that the lines were quite intelligently spoken and some parts were rather dramatic, but they believe in this world, in this dream-controlling instance. They are highly indulged in it, which I find to be the best part of the film. You have your try-hard teams such as in The Matrix, all the riddles spoken, etc., when people only gave a damn about the action. You have your try-not teams like with Twilight, piss-poor dialogue, lots of frequent pausing, and a laughable showcase to actors who actually had some talent. Then you have something like Inception come along, make-believe team. Sounds cheesy from the get-go, true, but that's what they did. They tried their best to make us believe their world, and whilst some things could have been explained further, such as the device, there was still that sense of realism involved in the film, as mentioned with the zero gravity sequence, keeping science intact.     That's just how I look at the film. Most of you have your personal preferences and biased opinions, which is ultimately fine, but if you're trying to force your thoughts onto others, that's where these reviews start to get out-of-hand. I wish most would include both pros and cons with this film (and all films for that matter), but I look at the five-star ratings and the one-star ratings noticing the mass amount of bias. It's either \\"best film ever\\" or \\"overrated film,\\" respectively. But what people don't realize is that...best film ever only applies to you, overrated film only applies to you in a sense. People who claim things to be overrated...it's as if you lack the ability to accept others opinions. Something becomes popular, you want to see what all the fuss is about (without a clear head, mind you, you're likely not interested going in because of the set bandwagon), and begin to nit-pick beyond belief. It's amazing yet depressing how this race reacts sometimes. Yes the film is \\"seemingly intelligent-sounding\\" to the point where the actors talk in a persuasive manner, but that's the vibe of the film. I honestly didn't see it as half-assed, I saw it as supporting the main idea more than anything. I admit some bits seemed to try too hard in explanation, but overall no one ended up being really confused.    That's another piece to divulge into. The fact that this was more of an 'everyman' film. What do I mean by that? Simple, it wasn't difficult to follow, tried to go into as much detail as possible in order to help anyone understand, from casual movie-goers to the huge fans of the sci-fi/thriller genres. But the latter tends to this film as too easy, the \\"trying to be intelligent\\" argument is immediately thrown in for attempting to appeal to everyone. It's understandable. But I mean, Shutter Island, a great psychological thriller, wasn't entirely well-received because it was more for fans of that genre, the everyman wasn't into it overall, they couldn't decipher it. I've had many debates involving that film this year, good ones discussing the plot and it's ending, but only to those that really understood Shutter Island. With Inception, I wasn't limited to my discussion on the film, for those that saw it can reflect back and better understand the movie.     If I seem too harsh on you, well then I apologize for hurting your opinion in any way, but that shouldn't happen because...at the end of the day, this is for entertainment purposes. Films, music, games, it's all entertainment, and we each have different tastes and preferences. I'm not starting a war on you, believe me that's the last thing I want to do, I really just wanted to explain the film's style and goals. Yes, I have my opinion as well and did favor the film, but I know it's far from perfect. Want an example? Fine by me. I wasn't sure what the architect's role really was at first. I thought they could have explained how that person manipulated another's dream world, but I eventually assumed that they were there to keep the person within their dream...to keep their conscious on low-priority. They tried to make the dream seem like a reality as best as possible, and I believe that the device used to put them in the same dream world also had to do with the architect. Still, would have loved a more clearer analysis shown in the film, but I suppose that, like the unclear ending, is up to us.     In regards to my title of the review. All of you screaming Prestige, Memento, etc., must know that Christopher's brother, Johnathan Nolan, was not involved in this film. Most also believe that it's because of that, that the film fell flat on it's face, but I think otherwise. I think this film showed what Chris could do without John, and the end-product turned out to be something special. Sure Memento was more engaging, The Dark Knight was highly entertaining, etc., but this film had elements that mixed well together, too, and we need to realize this before ripping it apart. One scene in particular comes to mind that blends in nicely: When DiCaprio was talking to Murphy about the dreams, I thought that was brilliant...why? Because you could see DiCaprio struggling to maintain his feelings and emotions, and the dream sequence coming to realization of his actions the moment he was slipping. It's what I like to call the human side effect, a human flaw in films to show that...even though it's a film that has many possibilities, it's goes on without showing a Superman move. You have films such as Accepted where Long is everything, and I really disliked the film for that. He's a rock star, a motivational speaker, deceiver, etc.. He barely had any bad moment, which we all know is impossible in the real world, heh.     All in all, I just wanted to get a few responses out because...I'm seeing the same exact arguments being re-worded with each extreme-rated review. I'd rather look at films and judge their core. Some films focus more on the action whilst the acting and story are sub-par (which I felt Matrix was). Some films spend more time on the special effects, with everything else seeming tacked on (Avatar, to me, fits this bill). Then there are those that keep the story as it's central focus, though the acting simply doesn't live up to it's standards. To me, this is a more well-rounded film, again the plot is the main idea, with the actors being the supporting detail, the score and special effects being the minor details. The little touches were carefully put in, which I commend Nolan for.

1593272774|4.0|Most LEGO sets are purchased to build the item pictured on the front of the box, whether it's a house, a firetruck, a helicopter, or the Millenium Falcon. If one needs further inspiration for expanding one's repertoire, these books are a must. They include \\"Simple Machines,\\" \\"Wheeled Wonders\\" and \\"Fantastic Contracptions,\\" and can be purchased as a set as well as individually. The complexity of the models tend to increase as one works through the 3 books.    They really are idea books, rather than a list of instructions on how to build. They have no prose, but list color pictures taken from many angles to show the construction of the toy. Most of the projects are fairly simple in concept and construction, but often elucidate concepts that can be adapted to other models, and thus they encourage creativity. And for the young builder whose grasp of language and/or attention span may not be up to following a list of the 10 or 20 instructions required to build a model, the graphical approach will encourage focus and ultimately success.    If your house is like mine, you have a large box of LEGO parts from many different LEGO projects. You may not have all of the parts necessary to make these models. The publisher lists a website (referenced in the reviews for this product) that details the parts required for each model, including a reference to the merchant who can sell you the part. This is good, but it would be more helpful to have the merchant make up a set of parts that fulfill the requirements for building each model, or a set of parts for each book. Many people interested in this set of books will have interest in, or have already purchased a LEGO Mindstorms NXT set. Since the Mindstorms set already has a wide variety of parts, cross-referencing the requirements of the models in these books versus the parts content of the Mindstorms or other LEGO sets would also be of benefit. I deduct one star because of this deficiency, but the concept of an illustrated guide tothe creative use of LEGO parts is a strength of the set. Highly recommended.

B003VIW8DK|3.0|When a sample from Roxy Music's last (and my least favorite) album \\"Avalon\\" begins this album, I took it as a bad omen. I'm not the kind of fan that wants an artist to repeat himself- I seek the thrill of growth. \\"You Can Dance\\" does grow nicely out of that sample and while it's catchy, it's a bit too comfortable. That song and the following \\"Alphaville\\" (a favorite) make for great dance/club music, no denying. But by \\"Heartache By Numbers\\", a pretty choral affair, it dawns on me that I don't notice any of Ferry's Roxy cohorts playing- they're just buried in the mix along with Bryan's voice most of the time. I do love \\"Me Oh My\\" which wouldn't have sounded out of place on his last (and one of his best) original efforts \\"Frantic\\". \\"Shameless\\" is a shapeless echo of any of the Suave One's dance-oriented CDs. While \\"Song to the Siren\\" is a beautiful and heartfelt Tim Buckley cover, I'm bothered that with a song that features Phil Manzanera, Andy McKay and Brian Eno, the sound is so generic and none of their contributions are recognizable. The other cover of \\"No Face, No Name, No Number\\" makes me drowsy as does the pointless \\"BF Bass (Ode to Olympia)\\" which could have been an outtake from \\"Mamouna\\", another lackluster project that nevertheless had its moments. This frustrating album ends on an interesting high note- the personal lyrics and relatively sparse instrumentation of the lovely and thoughtful ballad \\"Tender Is the Night\\". It sounds retro and fresh simultaneously, sort of like Roxy Music once did. I'd love to see BF experiment more; loosen up a bit next time. \\"Frantic\\" proved that he can still make exciting records.
0385340575|2.0|I love thrillers but have never read a Lee Child book before.  The reviews of  this book were good so I thought it would be a good book to start with.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  The characters weren't rich, fully developed characters that I loved or hated or really cared about.  Reacher, the protagonist, wasn't a particularly exciting character.  Since I haven't read any other Jack Reacher novels, there may be a back story that explains why he doesn't have a home or any possessions and, when he needs to change his clothes, he buys new ones and throws out the old, but I don't know what that story is.  It certainly wasn't explained here and it seemed pretty absurd to me.  Overall, it was good enough to finish but not good enough to recommend.

B004F5GKUA|5.0|OMG, I didn't think it could get any better, but it did.  I was riveted from the moment it started.  Doppleganger Clarks....much better than Red Krypto Clarks.  Much more contrast between good and evil.   I'm not going to say much more cuz I'm at a loss for words.  This is a must see....  edited 7 Jan 2011:  I just saw this again and I'm still blown away by how freakin good it is.  Tom Welling shines in this episode.  I'm so glad he was chosen to play Clark Kent in this series.  I can't see anyone else playing this role...ever.  It'll be weird seeing someone else in the role on the big screen...same goes for Erica Durance as Lois Lane.  This episode ROCKS....you gotta see it!!!

0316098337|1.0|It is rare when I dislike a book that seems to be so universally popular, but I thought 'Room' was horrible.  I confess to not being able to finish it.  After 60 pages or so, I grew tired of reading tedious details in a 5-year old voice and began to skim through the remainder of the book.  The near constant references to breast feeding were just too icky for me, and more than halfway through I decided I had wasted enough time.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|At the time of its release, this album absolutely blew its listeners away.  From the inventive cover to the incredible production values never before heard on a rock album, this album represented a complete left turn from all that came before.  It was called a 'concept' album, but it really isn't.  The songs seem to run together as a meaningful whole, but they have nothing to do w/ each other and lyrically there really isn't any message (apart from L  ucy in the S ky with D iamonds).  Pet Sounds, which preceded Pepper and motivated its creation, was truly a concept item and stands alone as the first and still the greatest of all concept albums.      Any review of art is mostly opinion.  There are some songs that I like a lot:  Sgt. Pepper, Sgt. Pepper (reprise), Lucy, She's Leaving Home.  Some songs that are ok:  Mr. Kite, Lovely Rita, With a Little Help from My Friends.  Some songs that are 'eh, whatever':  Getting Better, Fixing a Hole, Within You/Without You, Good Morning, When I'm 64.    There's one song that is truly extraordinary and IMO, the greatest song the Beatles ever recorded:  A Day in the Life.  If the album had 26 minutes of silence and just this one song at the very end, it would still be a good album.  Sgt. Pepper, a very good album?  No doubt about it.  The Beatles best?  Nah:  See Revolver, Rubber Soul or Abbey Road....
B001TH8UUA|3.0|Ordered this for our Panasonic Blu-Ray DMPBD60.  We kept getting U73 error with the player.  Contacted Panasonic support and they said it was a problem with the HDMI cable.  Bought the Panasonic HDMI cable [ASIN:B002AL3MSE Panasonic RP-CDHF15-K HDMI Free Angle 1.5m/4.9ft Cable]] & haven't had the U73 error yet.  Considering this Amazon cable average as it may work well with other devices but doesn't seem to be compatible with the Panasonic BluRay player we have.<br /><br />I also just tried using this with the Xbox 360.  Call of Duty Black Ops hangs when using this cable.  We switched back to the composite cables that came with the xbox 360 and the game plays fine.  Not sure if I got a bad cable but this doesn't seem to work for what we need it for.
B000008LOV|5.0|THE TRAVELING WILBURYS-VOL. 1: The quiet Beatle, folk's greatest poet, ballad pop's best singer, a roots rocker, and the head of ELO...supergroups seldom if ever worked out as well as the TRAVELING WILBURYS, who pooled their inestimable resources for a romp through the back streets of folk rock, RNB, and middle of the road pop. Working under nicknames like Lefty, Otis and Charlie T. Jr., harmonic hits HANDLE WITH CARE, spotlighting GEORGE HARRISON and ROY ORBISON's angelic peals, and the shuffling singalong END OF THE LINE were two of the late 80's heartiest adult contemporary singles. JEFF LYNNE's rockabilly rave-up RATTLED, the hypnotic drone of BOB DYLAN on MARGARITA, and TOM PETTY's calypso-colored LAST NIGHT rank right up there with the five lads' solo offerings; in fact ORBISON's swan song MYSTERY GIRL, HARRISON's comeback CLOUD NINE, and PETTY's first solo effort were albums made around the same time with various WILBURYS chipping in. VOL. 1, an apparently ego-free collaboration amongst friends, is a marvel of effervescence, blessed organic fun and playful comraderie.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE WILBURYS

B002ZG981E|5.0|I can honestly say that I don't understand all these people saying the they don't understand this movie. Of course there are certain aspects of it, that people will be debating for years to come, which is what makes it interesting and set apart from the average, but the main story is very easy to grasp. It is extremely intricate and deep, but presented slowly and explained to as it moves forward, so that you never find yourself completely lost. Don't be scared by people telling you, that you won't understand it. Watch it for yourself, it's a masterpeice.
B001VNB54A|5.0|i purchased this as a gift for my brother who is an Army Reservist. we saw the show together on HBO & loved it. the extras on the dvd's add so much more to the stories told
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|What can you say about cinema perfection?  EVERYONE should have this collection.  The movies are heavy, harsh, and blunt, but Clint Eastwood personifies the character he plays as the \\"hero\\" some of us would like to be.  There is evil in the world and maybe we shouldn't take care of it like Dirty Harry does, but we can walk in his shoes and feel the satisfaction empathetically.  Eastwood is a deadly force and a dynamic personality and I'd sure like his slippers under my bed!  Yowza!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle is without a doubt the best show Nathan has done since he charmed audiences in Firefly! You just can't beat the cast chemistry, especially between Castle and Beckett.  Of course they still haven't hooked up (seriously guys, just do it already) so I'm hoping for some more juicy situations in Season 3.    I personally LOVE behind-the-scenes stuff - something about seeing the actors out of character and describing the show fascinates me because it reveals the other side of making the show. It was disappointing to see this box set is severely lacking in extras and audio commentary, but I was looking around on Amazon and I found [[ASIN:B004CYF7D0 Castle:  Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center]]-  it has some awesome stories from on-set, how they shot the pilot, and using the real-life Richard Castle novel as marketing tactic. If you like DVD extras this is a great accompaniment to the Season 2 DVD set. Watching this I could really tell that Nathan and Kate LOVE working together and that was so much fun to see!
B002ZG981E|5.0|A mind-blowing triumph... A truly awesome film... Quite possibly Christopher Nolan's best film to date! The Best film I have seen in a long time. My mind is too blown to say anything more... (My initial review of the film, saw it on opening day)
B002JVWR4A|4.0|I must admit, at first I didn't think this show had the capacity to last more than 1 or 2 seasons. It started off so cookie cutter-ish that I couldn't see myself continuing to watch it. But the relationship between Booth and Bones has been so well crafted that I'm now totally hooked! The show still manages to walk that fine line between dark comedy and intense (often graphic) subject matter. Wish they had brought back Zack, though...what a great character and so well acted.     I've always wondered what Emily Deschanel was like in real life (does she actually posses real social skills?) so I picked up [[ASIN:B004CYF76M Bones: Cast & Creators Live at Paley]]...Loved hearing her take on Dr. Temperance Brennan.  It was also neat to hear from the creators of Bones and learn about their inspiration for the show. With all the crime series out there, it's interesting to learn about what makes this one so unique.  I hope they can keep it up for all of Season 6.

0545302862|5.0|I picked up this set because I am pre-reading for my kids.<br />The stories move right along, and rely on actual plot to carry the story, not excessive language.

B00006I53S|5.0|I don't know how it happened, but this lens is now almost always attached the the camera - over a year after I bought it and thought I didn't like it. I own the 55-250, but the quality of the photos I was getting when I tried to photograph my nephew's football games (from the sidelines) wasn't great. I switched to my next-longest lens, the 28-135, which I hadn't been using a lot because it's kind of heavy, and the lens doesn't lock so it creeps down when you're holding it (known issue).  But the photos I started getting of his games with this lens impressed me, and suddenly I realized how very useful the 28-135 focal lengths are. I do swap it out for my 35mm prime (LOVE that lens) but those two are the only ones that have a permanent home in my bag.<br /><br />I do wish it was a little lighter, and that it wouldn't auto-expand when facing down. Otherwise, I've come to love this lens.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|Nicki Minaj is not hip hop. This is the worst way to represent females in hip-hop, she sold out just like the Black Eyed Peas for monetary relevance. This is by far not what true hip-hop represents, of course these little kids gave this debut a 5 because they are impressionable and she's all colorful and cartoonish. The reality is if the brain cells of adults actually process this as hip hop something is wrong. It saddens me that urban music especially hip hop is being wiped out because it is not doing what pop is doing. The artists are being created by a gimmick, a beat, and collaborating w/ artists that sing pop or R&B...this is turning into Hip-Pop! Not anything that is worthy of true hip hop fans. The bottom line is she got blown up too early, she should have been able to develop a sound, this album should have been better prepared. She didn't have to cater to pop music if she wanted to represent the females in hip-hop, which she doesn't at all. I hope for her own sake she finds her voice, she said she wouldn't make a mockery out of the craft of acting but that is exactly what she is doing....ACTING. Acting like a rapper. She is making a mockery of the trailblazers that came before her in hip-hop. She compared Gaga and Madonna showing love to each other but says their is beef when black artists pay homage to those who came before them, yet she disses all of the female rappers that came before her. I can't wait until real hip hop stands up!!! She needs to go back to hip-hop college and study: Jean Grae, Lauryn Hill, MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, Missy and even her nemesis Lil' Kim. The mogul she wants to be that doesn't exist: Please tell her the moves that these women make behind the scene.  Queen Latifah is doing it all. She started her management company at 19, she is a Covergirl, she produces her own movies, her money belongs to her, not her crew! Still in the end, this album is not supposed to be in the category of hip-hop...
030745455X|1.0|Who wrote this book? It is stylistically nowhere even close to the first novel. There are endless lists, irrelevant details, and no real plot development over hundreds of pages from an author who can't find any better way to express this character's emotions than with expletives.  Salander was an intriguing character in the first novel; here she is flat and lifeless, deeply pondering mathematical equations and the square footage requirements of her next apartment. Seriously? Wish there was a way to send the Kindle version BACK to Amazon. And Super Salander can do anything! Hack into anyone's computer? No problem! And let's not even talk about the feats of strengths this 90-pounder is capable of performing! Please. What a waste.
B00427X9WI|5.0|Let me reveal right away...I'm a guy and have had my own experiences in the world I could actually call worldly. In work and play, I know how the world works, but I am always willing and eager to learn more. That said, EAT PRAY LOVE is a movie and adaptation you will either get or you don't. Either you enjoy it and appreciate it or you don't. And I am ok with that. Every movie is subjective to the viewer. With this film, it will either touch you deeply or disgust you. Let's start with touching.    Not everyone is lucky enough to have experienced the pain Liz does (Julia Roberts). I say lucky because in order to grow, you must feel pain I believe. And while some people found Roberts' portrayal of Liz Gilbert trite and shallow, I found it deeply moving and an effort I could relate to. For two and a half hours, I was removed from my living room and moved along the journey of Liz through Julia Roberts. She WAS Liz and even as an actor, I think Julia Roberts was showing she is still learning about the world around her. I found her pain and sorrow and eventual growth very real. Call me what you wish, but no film needs to follow a standard formula to appeal to the masses. EAT PRAY LOVE is an interpretation of the artist and this film clicks on all cylinders.    As for the disgusting part that some people label the entire film, I think perhaps they expect too much from movies and actors. To jettison the world around you as you sit in a movie theater or living room takes a talent many don't have. The message of this film and its characters is to let yourself go and create an open minded approach and view to the world around you and the world within you. Not everyone can do that and I am ok with that too. But call it what you will, EAT PRAY LOVE is an adoring look at one person's life among many. You will feel the energy and beauty of it or you won't. I applaud the filmmakers and actors for an escape that even men can, not should, appreciate. It's not just a chick flick, it'sa snapshot of one person's life that is far from shallow. It is a moving journey indeed.

0385504225|1.0|I was a big fan of Dan Brown's after reading Angels and Demons. It was, to me, very original and a page turner. I felt a little less so after reading The DaVinci Code, but still fascinated. But with his most recent book I have to say, \\"Come on, Mr. Brown, it's time for something new!\\" There are the same old characters, but with different names, and a new location (but really the same as in his two other blockbusters)and the same evil and large sinister bad guy. I found myself getting tired and irritated with each new explanation of secret codes, ancient symbology, and new technology which plays heavily into the plot. This book is obviously written to be a movie. Mr. Brown spends a lot of time trying to convince us of the complicated Freemason symbology, but I had to laugh when he attempted to add the Shriners to the list of sinister organizations. I could only think of an old picture of my Uncle Joe in his Shriner days, riding in a parade on a miniature motorized car with his fez hat on his head! Don't bother to read this book!
B001AQT0ZO|3.0|A modern rendition of a classic tale.  A bit edgy and over the top in some respects, but interestingly cresative.  I would not recommend for children or the uptight.    Also, the Blu-ray DVD did not work with my year-old system until I downloaded an update on my PC, saved it to a thumb drive, and loaded it on my player.
B004BSEKH6|4.0|To be quite honest I wasn't a die hard Nicki Minaj fan. I really didn't enjoy any of her mixtapes except for tracks she got hood on and songs she featured on. Then when that \\"Bottom's Up\\" track came out I was like yea she's officially crazy. So I previewed the album before it came out and I was shocked. This is actually a decent album to me for her. Although I still can't stand the \\"your love\\" song and \\"can't believe it\\" has finally grown on me a little. She has a very ecentric style and this seems to show it well. I know this album is more pop than anything but isn't majority of the music like that nowadays. I mean you even have artists that are known for their gritty and edgy gangsta rap styles making songs with a pop sound. I guess if you can't beat em join em right? Lyrically Nicki Minaj is tough. She's got skills there's no denying that. Plus when you look at what she's been thru I tip my hat to the girl. Gives me hope things won't always stay the same. She's like all of my favorite female rap artists rolled into one. You may not like her music but at least she made something different. I guranteee if she woulda came out with a more tougher sounding album like Lil' Kim's debut everybody would complain \\"oh she just tryna act hard or she still jockin Kim style again\\". I won't say this album is for everyone because I even see die hard fans that were listening to her from day one saying this is weak. So I'd suggest listen to it for yourself and then make your decision. For me, I like it.
B004B3BEHU|4.0|I think this album is so much better than \\"Rated R\\" Vocally she shows us she can get better and such a different style of songs. Love it!!
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|I honestly thought Mr. West would not be able to top 808's and Heartbreaks because it was so out the box. I have to say he's paving a road for future artists to put out creative material without fear. Also his G.O.O.D Friday's series helped in keeping interest in this album. I love when artists allow listeners to preview tracks before they finalize them. Although I wish more songs from the G.O.O.D Friday's would have made the cut for this album I am in no way dissappointed. My favorites would have to be \\"All of the Lights\\" and \\"Blame Game\\". Also \\"Blame Game\\" has a hilarious skit towards the end of the track. I'm glad to see Mr. West didn't let all the hate he was getting stop him from creating art. They say you can only go as high as you fall and with this album I think Kanye just shot up past the Sun. If your a Kanye West fan you'll like this album.
0525951652|3.0|I really wanted to love this book, but there were a couple drawbacks...    1)The characters- Some I really, really enjoyed and it was their interactions that helped tell the history for me. However, much of the character interactions seemed a bit implausible. (ie: extremely random meetings in war torn Europe that did not flow) And lastly, a couple characters just flat out annoyed me!!     2)The length-  I loved Pillars, so I'm not burdened by the 1000 page-ers. However, Fall of Giants had areas that just carried on too long, but then in some areas it did not go into the amount of detail that my curiosity would like.  This might be a preference issue, but I found myself skimming whole sections that seemed halting to the story development.     *****With that said*****    I was very pleased with the amount of detail Follett used with the weeks leading up to the war.  Great depictions and use of historical fact showing that it was not just 'war mongering' Germany that started the war (how it is sometimes assumed) And I also appreciated the honesty about the Treaty of Versailles.  It was one of the largest mistakes in modern history, and unfortunately that is also sometimes overlooked.    I am looking forward to the next books in the series, mainly with hopes of redemption. All in all it was a decent read, and I really did learn quite a few interesting things.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, however I have to admit I liked the book better. In all honestly this is the first time I can say that. I was hoping because the book was being divided into two it would closer resemble the book and that did ot hapen. It was still a very good movie that really moved, it was interesting from the beginning

030726999X|4.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the third and final book in Stieg Larsson's thriller trilogy.  In it, our hero Lisbeth Salander lies in a hospital bed down the hall from her murderous father while a secret group within the security police tries to silence her by having her committed yet again.  As usual, the other hero of the books, Mikael Blomkquist, helps Salander's cause through his expert investigative skills.<br /><br />TGWKTHN is a somewhat flat finale to an otherwise great trilogy.  After a beginning compelling for its unraveling of the plot from its predecessor, TGWKTHN devolves into a dull narrative.  There is very little suspense in this book.  The secret group out for Salander at first appear ominous, but Larsson allows very little time for any drama to build around their machinations before he has Blomkquist squelch them.  For a good third of the book, Larsson even keeps the bad guys out of the picture completely while he shifts to an interesting yet ultimately pointless sub-plot involving Berger.  (I do concede however that the author died after finishing this book, and who knows if the proper editing went into it, or if perhaps he had plans for some of the sub-plots in later books.)<br /><br />Essentially TGWKTHN is a very long denouement, where the remaining secrets are revealed and the reader is treated to an orgy of revenge, especially in Salander's trial, where again the bad guys give very little resistance, instead take their beatings well, seemingly resolved to the idea of their henceforth minor status in the story.<br /><br />This is Lisbeth Salander's revenge, and some readers will be happy with this.  For others, the idea that the end of TGWPWF would be the climax of the whole series might come as a disappointment.  Regardless, if you read the first two, you'll have to read this one too.  And despite the disappointing end, I found the trilogy to be a worthwhile endeavor.  Larsson did tie up most of the loose ends and the trilogy was wonderfully smart and touching overall.  That's why I'll give TGWKTHN four-stars rather than the three I would give it if viewed on its own.touching overall.

0440245931|5.0|I have read almost every book by John Grisham and I have not once been disappointed. Pelican Brief is another winner. Interesting plot, believable characters and non-stop action. One of his better ones.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Best \\"Kung Fu\\" flick I've ever seen.  No fights on a 12 story rooftop, but some of the most realistic ones I've seen.  The story really is the main point; it's not just a method of getting you from one action scene to the next.  I can't wait for the next installment.<br /><br />Five stars!
1596680199|5.0|Wonderful book! If only there had been a \\"Look Inside\\" for it, I would have realized what a treasure it is and snapped it up long ago. As it is, I wasn't particularly attracted by the cover, and since I already had another great book on bead-making, I didn't think of buying this one until someone in the CITY-o-Clay group at Yahoo spoke well of it.<br /><br />It contains an extensive section on faux techniques, including wood, veined marble, leather, jade, silver, turquoise, lapis lazuli, ivory/bone, mother-of-pearl, abalone, bronze, amber, coral (had lots of fun making coral!), and easier ways than I had known up to now for making onyx, agate, and malachite. I especially enjoyed making the coral. There is also a section called \\"Bringing It All Together\\" that covers findings and threads, attaching findings, and designing with beads.<br /><br />This book is good even for complete beginners, but also holds inspiration for clayers beyond that stage. Just a few of the headings in the Materials and Techniques section: drilling, sanding, polishing, and varnishing/extrusions/coiled beads/mokume gane/mica shift/molding/color mixing/applique/inlay/transfers/caning/and Natasha beads (called \\"Rorshach beads\\" in this book--which is another great name for them)<br /><br />There are pictures of and directions for many unusual beads and although I had already learned most of the techniques described, I found a lot of useful tips and good ideas throughout the book and keep going back to it to remind myself of them and find more.<br /><br />If I were pressed to point out a fault, that is the lack of help in finding sources for tools, findings, and materials.  A few \\"source\\" companies are mentioned in the credits at the back, but with no information beyond their URLs. Most books in this field have at least a page or two with the names and addresses/URLs of companies that sell the materials mentioned in the book, telling which company sells what. There is, however, a 2-page index to the book's contents; and on the last page you will find URLs for some helpful sites such as Glass Attic, Polymer Clay Central, and Polymer Clay Daily. Some of these contain forums, but Glass Attic is a sort of compendium of forum conversations on all aspects of polymer clay use, almost like an encyclopedia.<br /><br />So--no help finding tools and materials--but, ah well, nothing in life is perfect. This book is definitely worth having.
B002ZG981E|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and I think it's the best movie released in 2010.The dream within a dream plot was good but not as great as some people are trying to make it,it's an interesting idea but not genius. I also am tired of hearing people over intellectualize the plot and acting like people are not intelligent if they didn't like the movie.With that said this movie was interesting and mostly non stop action and they cast the movie perfectly the acting  was wonderful
B000X107GI|3.0|You can't beat the price on these.  At $2.50 for 5 with free shipping they're a great deal.  The battery life is decent, but not as good as either Duracell or Energizer.  So, my rating is Quality = medium (but perfectly acceptable).  Price = very good.
B0045XICB2|1.0|This movie was C R A P!!  All filler and 10 minutes of \\"something\\". I give it NO stars if I could!
B0008ENICU|4.0|FUN 1930'S MOVIE.  EXCELLENT CAST.  GREAT LINES.  ALL WOMEN.  FUN GIRLS NIGHT MOVIE AND THEN WATCH THE NEWER VERISON WITH MEG RYAN! SKIP THE FASHION SHOW SCENE!
B001B1R1HC|5.0|This is one of the treats the EMI shows to its audience. One of the very few sets performed by one of the greatest pianists ever at an affordable price and of an amazing audio quality.
B00447G2T8|3.0|Powerful, melodic, Kai Hansen roll over, Andi Deris delivers. Helloween never disappoints, this is a great traditional metal album, with a few surprise audio elements which stand out with a creative effectiveness.
B003YUC2FE|4.0|This was a great deal for all three blu-ray movies. The Package was cute, BUT I did not like the fact that the disc were stuck in foam. Personally I do not plan on taking them out constantly, so I'm not worried about scratching or damaging the disc, but for those who have lil' children and/or plan on watching them regularly, i suggest keeping them somewhere else.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|ok i was reading reviews and came across one who was complaining about getting the movie 2 days after the release date... ARE YOU SERIOUS? comeon be lucky your actually getting the movie to begin with mine wont even get here until like the 9th but im ok with it cause atleast i know im getting it and i dont have to fight people at a store for it or get there and they are all gone.... besides all that so far i think this is the best one they have made. im excited to see the 4th one
0439023521|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE!  I am 15 and I recommend that EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD (AND ALIENS)TO READ THIS BOOK SERIES!!!  I made BOTH of my parents read them and they are enthralled!  I read it and became obsessed!  I have all of the books, 5 T-shirts, the Mockingjay pin, and the Mockingjay necklace.  I loved it so much that I had my father drive my friends and myself to a book signing from Suzanne Collins-  I have been so greatful!  I couldn't stop smiling for weeks after!  Oh- I just cannot imagine ANYONE living who has NOT read this series!  I JUST LOVE IT!!!  A must have for anyone who is not interested in reading or is obsessed!  Let the Hunger Games begin!!!
B004498KPU|3.0|I will keep this short. I did not buy this set for one huge reason....and that is because the music video for \\"Human Nature\\" (the best song off THRILLER) is nowhere to be found on here. Even more strange, no other fans on here are making a big deal out of it's absence either. Even though it is not anything spectacular or perhaps not an \\"official\\" video, I do remember seeing it on MTV many years ago (and it can be seen on Youtube) and had become accepted as the only music video made for the song. There is no reason why it could not have been included on disc 3 with the other bonus videos. Also, I was disappointed to learn that the full version of \\"Ghosts\\" is missing, as well as the normal version of \\"Blood On The Dance Floor\\", the montage of \\"Dangerous\\" and \\"We Are The World\\". Plus it would have been neat to see \\"This Is It\\" (the song). Otherwise, I was pleased to see my favorite, sinfully underrated song (\\"Give In To Me\\") was actually on this set, along with all the others. Overall it was a good idea to release all of these videos together, but it was executed pretty poorly by Sony. Laziness is the only reason for this set not being everything it could have been.
0385737955|5.0|This book series is amazing!  I am 15 and I ADORE both \\"The Maze Runner\\" and its sequel \\"The Scorch Trials\\"!!!  Recommended for every person!  I made my parents read it and they both LOVED IT!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This show is Arrested Development meets The Office meets Scrubs.  Combining the good parts of the three while eliminating the bad.  It's easier to pick up right away than Arrested Development and it utilizes the Office's style of mockumentary presentation that lets you get relate to the characters during their \\"interviews\\".  At the same time, its not overly cheesy/over-the-top like The Office and Scrubs can be while at the same time having that feel-good story that Scrubs delivers.  Won the Emmy for a reason!
B00005JKJA|1.0|I watch about 20 minutes of this dog of movie.  It is just flat out bad and if a person can get this movie for under cost of a rental or PPV great. If you spend more than that then as the saying goes buyer be ware.      Form the title  the viewer would think they be tuning in to a good one but  not so with this one. It has a very poor script and to many chactors to keep the viewer attention.  In one scene you have this goofy looking movie director driving out some place to talk with another goofy looking cowboy dude.  And for over 20 mins the viewer is left wondering where in the blue blazes is this movie going?   It only rate a 1 star and that being kind.
B003EYVXSW|3.0|I was in awe at the beginning of the movie until they move to the barn.  Then it just got ridiculous.  Loved the special effects, but they killed the story from about the middle to the end.
0385732554|5.0|Jonas lives in the `Community', a supposedly utopian world where everything is flawless. There are no good or bad, there is no hunger, no war, and no pain - a perfect world to live in. Jonas lived 12 years of his life without questioning the system and accepting things as they were. But when he is selected as the `Receiver of Memories' he starts to discover secrets which lie beneath the perfect exterior of his world which he rather would not have known. As he receives more and more memories his wish to explore the world beyond his Community increases. A compelling tale showing the courage needed to go against a set system to bring a change.<br /><br />The characters are perfectly described and none of the characters are bland. Most of the characters are accepting of the system of the `Community' and do not want to change it or are rather scared to go against the system. The main character of the book Jonas on the other hand is unsatisfied with the way things are and wants to see it change. Sometime before he becomes twelve he notices certain changes in his surroundings which he can't explain. When he becomes the Receiver of Memories he starts to understand the change he had experienced, change he which had made him feel free and not bound by rules. His longing to explore the world beyond grows stronger with each new memory he gets even though he knows it's illegal. My favourite character from the book would be the Giver who gives the memories to Jonas. Sad and melancholy in nature, he is the only one who understands Jonas' longing for freedom and even decides to help him escape.<br /><br />The book is a complete page turner and raises issues which force the readers to ponder upon. What if the world was perfect, a world where everything was same and without any conflict? Would we still long for the imperfect world? For the people living in Jonas' world the world they live would be a utopia but for the reader it is a dystopia where all things are controlled by one person, a world where there is no freedom of thought and talk of change is not endured. The people controlling Jonas' world to be perfect even the families are made so that they are perfect. People are made to think what the rules say are right. Even their profession is chosen by other people. This book shows us the imperfect world hidden behind the fake exterior of a perfect world.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all young adults. A book which would compel you to ponder upon the concept of the perfect world which we all wish for. If you liked this book you would also like The Seventh Tide by Joan Lennon and The Time Machine by H.G.Wells both of which deal with the same concept of utopia and dystopia.<br />A memorable and thought provoking book which cannot be easily forgotten. A compelling read.here there is no freedom of thought and talk of change is not endured. The people controlling Jonas' world to be perfect even the families are made so that they are perfect.

B000XRG9IW|5.0|What \\"rock\\" is supposed to be, yet so rarely is.  Sorry not to be more specific than that -- look thru the other reviews for individual song descriptions if you need to.  Better yet, just throw caution to the wind and buy this album.  Not a weak spot on it.
0439023483|4.0|I don't think I need to review this book even . So much has already been said ...In fact you must be wondering which planet I am living in , that I read this book now. I think so too! For a long time , I avoided reading this book due to all the hype surrounding it. Finally  I bought this book on impulse...because I was seeing this book everywhere..on every blog!<br />Was it worth it? YES!!! I read this book in half a day. I did not eat, sleep or do anything else! I forgot about an important college assignment too!<br /><br />The Hunger Games was shocking , scary and action packed. It made me afraid of what might be lying in wait for the future generation. I am sad that I decided to read the novel so late , when everyone is awaiting the third part. But -\\"Better late than never!\\"<br /><br />This was a fast paced, exciting and edge of seat novel. Katniss has to be one of the most kick-ass YA fiction heroine ever! Not once did I feel like strangling her , as I feel with most other YA heroines. She had so much \\"spunk\\" - a powerful female protagonist is so uncommon in fantasy books .<br /><br />Hunger Games is just not limited to senseless action , it deals with myriad of human emotions especially that of desperation. This original and unique dystopian novel has been very well written . The details of the setting are so vivid  that we can almost visualize all the action unfolding in front of us.<br />It really made me wonder , how desperation and hunger brings out the worst in human beings. This is when the Darwinian concept of \\"survival of the fittest\\" plays such a major role.<br /><br />Yes, this novel has lots of violence and aggression , but it has its moments of kindness and love too.Because of the graphic description of violence , Hunger Games might not be suitable for younger teens, but it is definitely more than worth it.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Compelling, intriguing , scary , innovative and entertaining dystopic fiction!<br /><br />Team Peeta/Team Gale?<br />Guys, you need to help me out here! I am so confused whom to support. Peeta seems spineless and needy. Gale is hardly there in the novel. I don't know whom to support.

B002NXSRVG|2.0|This movie had gunfights, explosions, cool vehicles and pretty much everything an action junkie likes. Problem is, they took a mediocre \\"B\\" action movie and slapped the G.I. JOE name on it. This was NOT the G.I. JOE I grew up with. And what's with the leather jumpsuits? Does EVERY action movie hero have to sport a leather jumpsuit now? First X-MEN now G.I. JOE. Only The Baroness should have been in a leather jumpsuit, and she was, so the movie wasn't all bad. Bottom line, it's a good way to kill two hours on a saturday afternoon, when it comes on cable.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I found this to be a very entertaining view of Queen Victoria.  Most of us are familiar with her later years.
B0045XKJBI|2.0|This is not a good movie, nor is it anywhere close to a faithful adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's book.  These movies, all three, make the characters out to be so shallow and immature.  The point is that Bella, who has always been very mature for her age, fits with Edward who is actually over a 100 years old, very mature and controlled.  They had them doing things in the movie that the Edward and Bella in the book would never have done.  I can't understand why Stephenie Meyer would go along with it.  It has that slick quality when watching it, and you can't get pulled into the movie or care about the characters that way.  If these movies weren't based on the best-selling books, no one would ever watch them. I am not into sci-fi or vampire movies or anything like that.  What I enjoy in the books is the romance, the give and take, and the self-sacrifice in Edward and Bella's relationship.  I enjoy reading these because of the lack of sex, etc. which just cheapens and degrades the story.  So many parts were left out, and I know it is hard to keep everything in when making a movie.  I liked Rachelle as Victoria and saw no reason for the change to Bryce Dallas Howard, except they must have thought she was a bigger name. And they made Jessica valedictorian?  Boy, was that way off!!! The scene between Bella and her father concerning sex was just ludicrous.  Oh, yuck, this was the very worst one.  I guess, out of the three, the second one has to be the best of the bunch.  These vampires are also looking a little aged!!  No romance at all!  Zero!  What a disappointment.  I love the books, really don't like the movies.
B00204AA0O|3.0|Too many of the songs on this album are too sparse (no drums, just piano and vocals) and not melodically or lyrically interesting enough to hold their own. I found \\"Two birds\\" \\"Blue Lips\\" \\"Tidal Wave\\" and \\"Folding Chair\\" to stand above the others because they were a little more driving (uptempo w/drums) and catchy, rate them at 6/10.<br /><br />\\"Dance Anthem Of The 80's\\" is perhaps the worst song, while tracks such as \\"Human of the year\\" exemplify the general lackluster character of the album overall. I wanted more engaging melodies and choruses in place of the repetitive droney style that seemed to dominate. \\"Laughing with God\\" was humorous and nice, but not worth a revisit.<br /><br />That is all.
0375703764|1.0|A huge waste of paper. Could have been done one tenth of space. Pages and pages of garbage so irrelevent it really angered me when I realized I had been reading what felt like a phone book or dictionary.There actually was a cool story inside but it got totaly stretched out to thin to care how it went. Waywaywayway over-rated. Rod Serling would cringe.
0596805888|5.0|A perfect gift and read just in time for the holidays. Although I'm not much of a cook or fan of cooking, I do enjoy baking and this book was a delightful and fascinating read. Some of the sections I enjoyed reading the most included information about calibrating your oven temperature by a scientific experiment with sugar. It also recommends keeping a pizza stone in the oven when baking cookies. Another tip I enjoyed and have already put into use is to spray my non-stick spray on pans over the dishwasher's open door. It also told me to crack an egg by taping it on the counter not the edge of a bowl to prevent the egg shells from landing in your bowl (which I've had on occasion).    Things I never knew before behind the science of food are that freezing fish kills parasites and \\"If you've eaten fish, you've eaten worms.\\" Yuck. A scary thing I learned, Teflon non-stick pans can be toxic if you heat them up too high. I was also grossed out by the section on food borne illness. There was a fascinating part about humans and taste buds, normal tasters and super tasters. You can order test strips or count your taste buds to see if you are a super taster.    My favorite chapter was #5 Air: Baking's Key Variable, which was just my cup of tea for my enjoyable holiday activity of baking. The author discusses gluten, types of flour, yeast, baking soda, baking powder, eggs, sugar and fat. Although for my pie shells, I use all shortening and no butter.     If you have a geek or cooking enthusiast in your family, this book will make a perfect gift. I can just see the guys on Big Bang Theory enjoying this read.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|J.C. does it again as the main character, but this time not as the characters in \\"Count of Monte Christo\\" and \\"Passion of the Christ\\" which were also two other masterfully done movies by this dynamic actor like Johnny Depp who always brings his \\"A-game\\" by showing depth to his characters.    All I have to say is if you are a fan of historical backdrop movies mixed in with epic drama, love and action that contrast past and future by making them \\"clash as titans\\" (no not like that other dumb movie but rather metaphorically speaking in contrasting human values, mind and soul), then you will definitely enjoy this movie!!    THIS IS A MUST-SEE MOVIE.  I still can't believe I and friends never heard of it in theatres due to low marketing and distribution efforts by its producers but then it truly makes this a treasure and great find if you pick it!    Enjoy it with the family for the holidays.
B0042MDAL8|2.0|I'll keep a long story short.  This version does not have anything besides the movie.  If you are thinking of buying this version as a gift, don't.  If I hadn't been so excited to watch the movie that I tore off the shrink wrap without reading, it would already be on the way back for a refund.  As a fan, it is NOT the version I would have wanted.  Stupid me, pre-ordering!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Artistically well done and a very moving visceral presentation of the war in the Pacific as well as its affect on those in battle and those at home.  Not for the squeamish.  I highly recommend this mini-series.
B0045XICB2|3.0|Your a fan of the books, this is a definite worth watching experience. I devoured the books. But I have the same complaint with the movie as I do with the book. I think the character Victoria could of been more developed to be an extremely interesting \\"bad guy\\", with a little more back story. I wish that the final confrontation scenes could of been more interesting, which would of been if Bella was put in more danger. I mean did you ever get a real sense like she was in danger? No. I just feel like they could of given the audience more for the money. (Everything seemed mechanical, not really offering anymore than the book) I wish the movie would of been more deep than the book Can't a fan dream? I can't wait to see the next movie still though.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is brilliant to all the fans of avatar and sci-fic movies.. This is a superb set for the entertainment lovers apart from movie itself as they take us to the journey of avatar.. really recommending to everyone even if they like the sci-fic or not.. one movie in life time comes like this..hats off James Cameron
1416550534|4.0|The House at Riverton proved to be much more interesting than I  thought when I first looked into it.  Morton manages to switch   chronological frames skillfully and to successfully characterize  her main character, Gracie, at various times and ages in Gracie's  life.  The other characterizations also ring true, and ersatz  \\"happy endings\\" out of line with these characterizations do not  occur.  At the same time, she gives us interesting pictures of the  culture(s) of the times, including a focused look at the disparity  between \\"upstairs\\" and \\"downstairs\\" life in a large country home and  the ravages of World War I.    I was amazed, too, at how she avoided ending the novel in a  predictable way.  Various mysteries are revealed early, but are   trumped later by others.      This is not the simple novel I expected, especially from an  author who is still young.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I decided to read this book just because and found myself quickly reading the whole trilogy.   I must say not all of the story is completely original (very like Battle Royale and even somewhat like Twilight) but what things are completely original.  I will hand it to Ms Collins in terms of character development though.  I got very attached to the characters and found myself thinking about them even after I was done with all the books.  All three books are easy and enjoyable reads and I don't feel I wasted my time reading them.  So as long as the lack of complete originality doesn't bother you I would say these are great books worth reading!
B000MRA5NS|5.0|This movie was unbelievable.  The scenery and story were amazing and although it was a long movie you were left wishing for more.  I watched this movie on Blu-Ray with my Samsung 8000 series and couldn't believe how clear and stunning the picture was.  Great sound. If you wanted to test your T.V. out this is the movie to do it with.  No slow moments at all and not one ugly woman.  The best Bond movie yet, Quantum Solace was good but not Casino Royale.
B0042KZJR8|4.0|Love it! The 2 disc CD is filled with gorgeous songs and the second one contains Live performances, which came as a pleasant surprise.
B001HN6940|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have seen, everything seemed to move along really slow and not a lot going on.  Picture quality was great, however the audio quality left a lot to be desired.  I could not wait for the movie to end and I am a Johnny fan too.  I won't be watching this movie ever again.

B000002NJM|5.0|'Jackie Brown' may not be Quentin Tarantino's best film of all time, but if you're in for that lick-that-pussy funk & soul, then this is the real thing !<br />Like most other Tarantino soundtrack compilations this one contains the characteristic western \ eastern guitars (\\"Monte Carlo Nights\\"), yet another appreciative nod to C & W legend Johnny Cash (\\"Tennessee Stud\\") and inevitable snippets of (more or less) hilarious dialogue from the motion picture itself.<br />What is truly breathtaking here, however, is Mr Tarantino's excellent selection of soul gems and funk classics recorded between 1965 and 1995. Apart from tracks by Bill Withers, the Brothers Johnson, Bloodstone and Foxy Brown, the album features some genuine Philly sound (The Delfonics' \\"Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time\\"), Bobby Womack's brilliant \\"Across 110th Street\\", which sets the tone in the movie's 'Graduate'-style opening credit sequence, and Minnie Ripperton's utterly superb \\"Inside My Love\\". To top it all, you can even hear Pam Grier, the undisputable Blaxploitation queen and this film's leading lady, sing (\\"Long Time Woman\\").<br />The only aspect truly worth criticizing about this soundtrack is that many of the songs featured in the film (e.g. The Supremes' \\"Baby Love\\" or The Meters' \\"Cissy Strut\\") are not included. Why not remains an enigma - yet to be disclosed by Quentin Tarantino.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|First, I wanted to address a 1 star review that complained because they couldn't get the BD version to play in their BD player and got an error message about needing an upgrade.    Many of the BD movies require that your Blu Ray player have the latest firmware available from it's manufacturer.  They also frequently require that the BD player have at least 1GB of additional memory in order to play the BD disk.  This is especially common with BD disks that include the BD Live option.    Most players can be connected to the Internet via a standard Ethernet cable if you have a connection to the Internet via DSL or cable services.  Check your manual for instructions on how to hook your BD player to the Internet and upgrade it's firmware. It's usually done through the menu options in the BD player itself.    Also check your BD player manual on what type of flash memory card or stick it uses and how to install it.  There is usually a slot for it in the rear of the player. The slot is frequently labled EXT, at least on Sony BD players. You can get these memory cards at most stores that sell electronics and cameras or order them online at Amazon.  A 1GB card or stick is usually sufficient.    As for the movie, this is a fantastic transfer with stunning detail and clarity on the video and exquisite sound. Don't wait!  Order this movie today!

B0041KKYDI|5.0|Given the way \\"reality\\" shows like \\"Survivor\\" glorify it, the so-called \\"survival\\" sub-genre of true-life stories might seem to be old hat at this point.  But every so often, a film will come along to bust that notion.  And that is what takes place in 127 HOURS, a compelling story from Danny Boyle, the British-born director of such films as TRAINSPOTTING, 28 DAYS LATER, and the Oscar-winning SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.    The film is based on the experiences of Colorado-born adventurer Aron Ralston, portrayed by James Franco, who had gone out on a cross-country hike in the badlands of southern Utah in late April 2003.  Having befriended a couple of female hikers (Kate Mara; Amber Tamblyn), whom he promised he would show at their party when he got back to their camp, he continued his hike through isolated Bluejohn Canyon some thirty miles outside the Utah town of Moab and, while repelling down a cliff into the bottom of the canyon, dislodged a sizeable rock and then slipped.  The rock wedged his right arm between it and the wall of the canyon, and he remained stuck there for 127 hours, or just over five days in all.  Braving temperatures that ranged from the lower 90s during the day to below 50 degrees at night, he had to be careful how he used his water, and he documented his story and his personal musings on his camcorder, trying very hard to dislodge the rock that was keeping him in place by chipping away at it with a rather cheap made-in-China pocket knife.  It only seemed to prolong the agony, because the rock was never dislodged.  With very little time left, and his water supply running dangerously low, he was forced to do the unthinkable to extricate himself.    Boyle's only error in directing the film, and a minor one at that, is that he sometimes has the penchant of directing in a head-twisting MTV-influenced rapid-fire editing style that mars some of the films of his fellow Brit Tony Scott; and the score by A.R. Rahman sometimes verges on irritatingly loud.  Otherwise, however, 127 HOURS is a compelling saga from beginning to end, with Franco accurately depicting Ralston's real-life transformation from cocky adventurer to world-weary survivalist, and the fact that it was filmed either at or near the very Utah locale where Ralston's saga actually unfolded.  The extrication scene, though it only lasts maybe four minutes and happens naturally at the climax, understandably has made a lot of viewers extremely queasy, much like the Omaha Beach sequence of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did in 1998.  But it's at least true to the story itself instead of being hyper-sensationalistic with the blood.    In the end, 127 HOURS is compelling evidence of how we sometimes don't realize how precious life is until we find ourselves on the edge of losing it prematurely.  And while Ralston had to learn this the hard way, his saga will hopefully reinforce that truth among the rest of us.
B004A8EI9M|5.0|This series has a perfect blend of drama and horror that allows the viewer to connect with characters and their daily struggle to survive amidst all of the chaos. Can't wait for the next episode.
0316098337|5.0|This was the best book I've read in a long time, and the story stayed in my thoughts for days afterwards.  It grabbed me from the first page and I didn't want to put it down.  Well-written, intriguing, disturbing, suspenseful, and heartbreaking.  I loved this book and plan to give it as a Christmas gift this year.
B000RO9PXC|3.0|OK - I just ordered it and will review it after I listen.  But I couldn't wait to post that I was there and remember it pretty well.  Despite the fact that I grew up during the 60s, I was pretty ignorant about music.  Sure, I enjoyed The Beatles, Stones, Hendrix, etc. - but I didn't really appreciate what I was hearing, etc.<br /><br />So, my buddy brought me to Boston Arena as a birthday present.  Honest - I really didn't know who The Doors were. Jim was drunk on his butt and the music was NOT good.  I turned to my friend and said, \\"These guys suck!\\"  He grabbed me by the arm and asked me if I wanted to get out of there alive - because most of the people around us thought that Morrison was GOD!  I ended up just standing there, suffering through a pretty bad concert, but without commenting further until we were safely outside.<br /><br />I'll be very interested in hearing this concert through my more \\"mature\\" ears!  Will 40 years make a difference?  Oh, I had to rate it to post my comment, so I gave it 3 stars.  Maybe I'll change that after listening?
B002JVWR4A|5.0|The Fifth season included the awesome 100th episode with Boreanaz directing.It was fantastic to see all the people who had ever been on Bones.  The DVD arrived on schedule in great shape and at a great price.  Thanks.
B002ZG98LO|3.0|If you are a fan of the \\"PREDATOR\\" franchise you will find this somewhat enjoyable. More of an action film really. Good acting on most parts and good effects. Only a few downfalls. The biggest being not enough screen time for the tittle characters! To much time and effort spent on trying to build up the hunted human characters. Over all, lots of action and a little gore make it worth watching.
B0000DG00B|5.0|When I was younger, I had a great best friend named Norm. He loved Duane Allman and The Allman Brothers' Band. With Norm's encouragement, I too came to highly appreciate Duane Allman and The Alllman Brothers' Band. We used to drive all over the Midwest with Duane Allman and The Allman Brothers' Band tapes playing incredible music on Norm's car stereo. So I dedicate this review to you, Norm, wherever you may be. Norm, I treasure our friendship and pray that you are still doing well. I want to tell Norm and also tell everyone else that I have finally found and often listen to Live At The Atlanta International Pop Festival, the VERY BEST SOUNDING 2 cd set of The Allman Brothers Band live when Duane Allman was still a band member. I strongly recommend this 2 cd set to you. The Allman Brothers' Band sounds best in a live concert. Live At The Atlanta International Pop Festival has much superior sound quality in comparison to the Allman Brothers' Fillmore Concert releases. My enjoyment of Duane Allman, The Allman Brothers Band, and Live At The Atlanta International Pop Festival has first led me to a much stronger appreciation for blues and rock blues music, which has then strengthened my conviction that Freddie King is \\"The King of the Blues.\\"    John

Cons: at least 1/3 of the blocks - maybe more - are appliques, and too many of those are downright kitschy.  Some pictures of crafts. NO pictures of quilts.

B0033AX20E|5.0|I started listening to Dragonforce this year and I have to say their music is awesome. All of the Albums are good, Valley OTD is really full of gems. The more you listen to it the more you like it thats the way all of their music works. F$%& the haters really. Black Winter Night is probably my fav song on this Album but I'm sure you will find your own. I think its about time for you to enjoy dragonforce if you have not been, what are you waiting for?
B001QITO52|4.0|In 1987, both Pink Floyd and Roger Waters released new albums.  Roger released \\"Radio KAOS\\", which I felt was the worst of his solo efforts.  It had a bad 80's production value to it, and musically it was weak.<br /><br />Pink Floyd (or, more accurately, David Gilmour) released this album, which musically is quite excellent, but lyrically weak.  Gilmour has admitted that he's not a strong lyric writer, and while the lyrics here are certainly better than anything released by today's pop stars, it's not strong compared to anything Pink Floyd had released previously.<br /><br />One reviewer had previously stated that Roger \\"wasn't missed.\\"  I feel quite the opposite.  He certainly was missed, in the same way that Gilmour is missed on Roger's albums.  These are two guys who NEED each other.  They're the Lennon/McCartney of the band.  To achieve the Pink Floyd that we all know and love, you need Roger's biting lyrics with David's awesome melodies and guitar solos.  When they're together, it's magic.<br /><br />There's quite a few highlights here: \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"One Slip\\" are great, catchy pop songs.  \\"On the Turning Away\\" is a nice ballad that builds to a fiery Gilmour solo at the climax.  \\"Sorrow\\" is a heavy guitar driven classic.  However, as good as it is, it doesn't really hold up that well next to anything Pink Floyd put out in the 70's.<br /><br />\\"The Division Bell\\", which came out 7 years later, is much closer to a true \\"Pink Floyd\\" album than this, and much better.
B002RI9YHS|3.0|I bought this book right away after reading Surely you are joking... and find it not as good mainly because the second half is somewat boring description of investigation of NASA shuttle crash. On the other hand if that is what you are interested in, go for it, because he describes it in great detail. Other than that book contain sad story about the death of his wife, speach about science and couple of stories which would fit nicely in Surely you are joking.

B0036QVOPU|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite of the Sherlock Holmes mystery. With Holmes sidekick, Dr. Watson, taking center stage, it's dark gothic setting is wonderfully eerie and entertaining with an English moor, escaped killer on the loose, and, of course, the deadly hound of the Baskervilles. Definitely a good place to start in reading the Sherlock Holmes novels by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle or watching one of the movie or TV adaptations. -- R. Barri Flowers, Author of DEAD IN THE ROSE CITY
B00275EHJG|5.0|This, by far, has to be one of the best movies ever.  I rate it for everyone, kids and adults alike.  I have had more adult friends borrow it and thought it was just fantastic.  A few of us even shed some tears at different points thoughout the movie.  It is very touching and in a way, educational for the children.... It teaches them to 'never forget' the important things in life!
B000ASATWQ|5.0|So glad I sat down and read the words to this track and followed along.....This CD opened my eyes to a wonderful artist!
0920668372|5.0|I adore this little book Love You Forever. I expected my granddaughter to receive this title. She did not. However, the book she did receive was and is most loved. She received I Love You As Much with the barcode for Love You Forever on it by accident. It was fine. We love it. She loves it. Books about how much we love our little ones are always tops on my list! Either book is wonderful for children, parents, grandparents alike.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|Norah Jones has done it again. Her new album \\"Featuring\\" is amazing; her voice and talent evident as it weaves through a vast assortment of incredible artists. And with that, this album lives up to its namesake. In just one CD you'll find every genre, and every legend or legend in the making. The artists listed reads like an award show: The Little Willies; The Foo Fighters; Sean Bones; Willie Nelson; Sasha Dobson; Dirty Dozen Brass Band; El Madmo; Outkast; Q-Tip; Talib Kewli; Belle & Sebastian; Ray Charles; Gillian Welch & David Rawlings; Ryan Adams; Dolly Parton; Herbie Hancock; Charlie Hunter; and M. Ward.     An eclectic mix of the world today, Norah Jones hits it out of the park on this new album. My personal favorites are her collective accompaniments with Ryan Adams on \\"Dear John\\" and Dolly Parton with \\"Creepin In\\". You can listen to these as well as the entire CD on the Norah Jones official website: […]. So if the sheer wealth of artistry didn't convince you to an immediate purchase, sit back and relax to preview the entire CD on her homepage. Also, take the time to view the video link located on the official website as well. It gives a great backstage pass on how each song came together.     Any artist can be lucky enough to produce hit songs. But few can create an album that can be listened to, where every song can become a favorite. \\"Featuring\\" does this, and that iswhere I find myself highly recommending it.    [[ASIN:B003YWUTJI ...Featuring Norah Jones]]
B004BSEKH6|5.0|If you like an eclectic array of music you will like this.  Since we bought it, wife and I, we have been playing it almost every day.  No skips.  It offers a little bit of everything.  I think an album like this will have Nicki playing a big part of the music industry in the future.  I look around and I see people giving this album 1 or 2 stars.  Thats insane!  She has enough good tracks to atleast get her to 3 or 4 stars. I dont think people who rated this album even bought the album or gave it a listen.  Nicki has a hate-following.  Maybe is because of her image or some people dont like her style.  If you want a real rating look at the reviews who rate her 3 stars or above. This is a great album and teens or preteens would even love it (Clean Version) anyway.<br />Here's my track for track breakdown 5 being the best. Im a fan of B.O.B, Outkast, Nas, Mosdef, Cee-lo, Kanye, Kid Cudi, Talib Kweli, Wiz Khalifa, Curren$y, Black Eyed Peas, The Dream, N*E*R*D and Wale just to name a few.<br /><br />1) Im the best  5<br />2) Romans Revenge  5<br />3) Did it on em  5<br />4) Right thru me  5<br />5) Fly  4<br />6) Save Me  5<br />7) Moment 4 Life  5<br />8) Check it out  4<br />9) Blazin  5<br />10)Here I am  4<br />11)Dear Old Nicki  3<br />12)Your Love  5<br />13)Last Chance  4
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Toy story 3 is a beautiful wrap up to the story of woody, buzz, and friends. My three year old son loves it! The only scary part for him is the monkey security scene at the day care!   For adults, andy's transition to college is emotional and sweet.    No complaints about amazon; as always, a smooth order and delivery!
B0041QSZJM|5.0|What a joy of a CD. It is a traditional set with some beautiful multicultural twists. I am purchasing 4 more for gifts.
B0002NRQTI|4.0|Poor Rush.  It is a running joke amongst fans that every new Rush album is heralded as the best one since Moving Pictures.  In retrospect, this is never really true.  On the positive side, however, Rush's post-MP albums are always at least strong enough that Moving Pictures never seems to become an albatross around their collective necks.  Counterparts is probably the album in the 1990's that came closest to earning the best-album-since-Moving Pictures crown.  This is a really good rock album.    Why is it so good?  Well, it isn't because of song structure.  Most of the 90's albums are very uninspired in their formal construction - lots of pop music type song structure that is very predictable.  Gone are the days when you had no idea where a Rush song would end up when you heard it the first time.  The band arrangements are a bit of a return to form however.  Keyboards are kept to a minimum and the guitar is relatively uneffected and in-your-face-rockin'.  I think this can be put in the plus column.  There are even some memorable guitar solos, and let's face it, Alex Lifeson's guitar solos have been largely forgettable since after Power Windows.  The lyrics are good, too.  Conceptually, the album seems to address relationships and the duality of the masculine/feminine impulses.  Sometimes, Peart's observations seem aloof, but they generally aren't preachy and they also aren't about necromancers and Greek gods so this one goes in the plus column as well.  Above all, this album is catchy and actually grooves (as much as a Rush album can groove)!  Speed of Love is the only tune that I tend to skip when I listen to this; the rest of the songs are truly infectious.  Some of the highlights: the powerful, melodically dark Animate; the soaring Nobody's Hero; the grooving Cut to the Chase; the instrumental layering of Alien Shore.  Perhaps the dark heaviness of the album is a response to some of the music happening at the time (Tool, perhaps?), but by this time Rush managedto surreptitiously assimilate any influences that they might have felt.  Most of Rush's music since Moving Pictures have exhibited a strange dichotomy where on one hand their music sounds totally their own, and on the other, it rarely dares to venture outside of standard pop melodic/harmonic/formal structures.  Sometimes Rush's music suffers because of this dichotomy.  This album rises above it.
B00009ZYBY|4.0|The holiday price was finally right to gift myself this disc. I had concerns the movie would be more drama and less action. There is a good balance between the two. When I watched the video, several of the battle scenes blurred and you really didn't get a good view at times because the scene was shot so far back or microscopically close at turbo speed and detracted from my enjoyment of the movie. There were several twists in the plot to keep my interest on how the Gladiator was going to win back his status in the empire. The level of incestuous interest by the part of the brother for his sister was not a highlight of the movie for me. A few of the details like how some of the pivotal information was gleaned by Caeser to intervene on his sister's actions made the movie complicated to follow toward the end. Perhaps additional viewings of the movie will make some things more apparent, but I usually \\"get\\" movies the first time. I found the movie to be in a similar style to the HBO \\"Rome\\" series. There are several graphically violent parts and the movie is not meant for children.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|These cables are great. They are reasonable (much more reasonable than buying at a retailer), the build quality seems very good.  I bought two to use with a LCD TV that I mounted on the wall - I am glad I went with the extra length (3.0 vs. 2.0 meters).      It was nice to have them arrive in \\"certified frustration free\\" packaging - a small cardboard box instead of the rediculous plastic packaging that most items come in.   Would buy this again next time I need HDMI cables.
B000068TP0|5.0|Shakira is the best! It was really fun to look at some old school shakira. In her early performance [1999] you can see her smooth moves and hear her wonderful vioce. You can select english subtitles and you can understand her songs while listening to her beautiful singing. You will watch this dvd over and over again.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Loved this movie! Not only does is have heart-pounding action, but it also stretches the imagination with physics-related speculation.  Denzel Washington's magnetic personality and extraordinary good looks certainly add interest to the plot, a hero to cheer for.  I also enjoyed the setting, New Orleans, with its colorful characters and beautiful scenery.
B004F5GKUA|5.0|Tom, Allison, Justin, Erica, John S, Annette, John G. and Michael R. - thank you for a wonderful ride.  Ten years is a commitment of note and it has been fun to have followed the center four as you've grown in your trade.  I hope each of you carries on with notable projects and that you'll be with me in many interesting ways for years to come.  I am trying to to be sad - that will come in the months ahead.  What a body of work and so honestly played that I feel I know you just as I did the Cartwrights of years past.  Well done!  Thank you again for an awesome decade!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|This is the last season of LOST.  The dvd came new in box, but some of the discs wouldn't play on my dvd player - my dvd player is old, so i guess that's why, so i had to watch the discs at my friends house.  Other than that,, i love LOST and what can I say about the this item???
B002NVTBOU|5.0|The minute I heard her featured on NPR as one of the 50 greatest voices, I knew I had to get her album. I am thrilled with the three I bought on Amazon. Her voice is unique, beautiful and raw with soul. You just have to listen to her! My only regret is that I don't understand her words but I have a friend translating for me now.
B00371QQ0M|4.0|Love the movie but the this blu-ray does not resume play where I stopped watching it on my PS3.  A bit annoying...
1586210912|5.0|I thought this was a really great audiobook.  We ask children what they want to be when they grow up, and we define ourselves by a kind of work we will do in exchange for money.  The entrepreneur is different.  A lawyer may or may not aspire to own his own firm with a large staff.  A physician may or may not aspire to write books or to grow and labor beyond the basic scope of his practice.  And all the rest of us, we may or may not seek out income producing assets to spend our money on instead of all the nice possessions we like to surround ourselves with.  No matter how Kiyosaki profits from teaching people to grow wealth, it did have the feel of a very rich man condescending (that's not negative, not in this case) to show us more average people how we think differently, and how we might like to change.
B001G8XON0|5.0|Moulin Rouge is one of my favorite film of all time. I've been waiting bluray edition of this movie. When it's coming, i buy it immediately.   And it's worth it! I love it.. The picture and sounds quality is top notch!
B003NWRLN6|2.0|Similar to how \\"Girl Who Played With Fire\\" was, this book has a lot of \\"fluff\\", mundane details and side stories that distract from the story itself.  I like the primary story here, but there was WAY too much other stuff that had NOTHING to do with the story that was clearly there just to stretch things out to two books.  My recommendation is just watch the movie - especially \\"Girl Who Played With Fire\\" - its better than the book because it gets right to the story (even though the acting and directing is \\"so-so\\").  \\"Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" blu-ray will come next month - just wait for it.
0143036556|5.0|An excellent book by UCLA Geographer Jared Diamond. He analyzes the collapse of societies, and looks for commonalities. At a talk at the Claremont Colleges, he noted that the single most important factor that ALWAYS went before a societies collapse was the disparity between the elites and the workers and poor. The elites develop secured and gated communities where only they can live, and the poor live in areas of crime and filth. The elite gain special education, social standings, and special priveleges while the poor live in disease.<br /><br />One wonders at the contrast between our current wealthy and political elite who fly in their own private or government jets to private airports, live in security gated communities, travel with armed bodyguards, and command multimillion dollar (or more) annual incomes with the rest of society today. Some talk of \\"social justice\\" while consuming vast amounts of jet fuels and electricity to power estates. While previous civilizations did not have the ability to broker carbon credits to justify their overlarge consumption, no doubt they created other and analogous justifications appropriate to their culture and time. A current example between the political elite and nonelite is the presidential visit to India, using a kingly 37 warships, 3 helicopters, 5 armored cars, 3 command stations, a retinue of 3000, and a cost of over $200 million dollars a day of money from other countries. We can only hope that our culture does not appear in the next version of this book, written by some future anthropologist.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|In The Pursuit of Happyness, Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith) goes from being an out-of-luck medical appliance salesman to an intern at a major brokerage firm.  This happens while he is a single father, loses his home, and literally lives out of his suitcase.<br /><br />It is a movie that focuses on determination and perseverance, and love.<br /><br />I understand this is a fictionalized account of the real Chris Gardner, currently a multimillionaire philanthropist and motivational speaker.  His path to fame and fortune was rough, and that is what was portrayed by Smith in this movie.  As Gardner (Smith) faces challenge after challenge, his son, Christopher (played by Will Smith's own son), is right there with him, going from apartment to hotel to homeless shelter.  The personal agonies hit you in the gut, so that the viewer is left with an unsatisfying... guilt?  Fear?  Many viewers cannot understand the impact of seeing a five dollar bill leave your pocket, knowing that the bill represents food for the day, now gone.<br /><br />And when Gardner receives the competitive six month internship (yay), hears that only one of the twenty interns will be hired (brrrr), and finds out that interns are not paid a penny during that period (ouch), you will feel his angst.<br /><br />Watching Gardner's frustrations and trials was almost voyeuristic.  I wish there was more of a catharsis (\\"a release of emotional tension, as after an overwhelming experience, that restores or refreshes the spirit\\") at the end to give my stomach a chance to recover.
B000065V41|4.0|Every Christmas there are three movies that I have to watch.  Elf, Christmas Vacation, and The Muppet Christmas Carol.  When I moved out, I realized that I needed my own copies of these movies, so I ran out to get them.  However, I ended up with the DVD release where they cut out that beautiful song.<br /><br />So, even though this is a short review, I gave it four stars because I really do love the movie.  I know every song and I can quote every line.  But, I just wish that I had known before I had gone out and bought it that it was going to be missing Belle's song.<br /><br />Other than that, I haven't seen the Kermit's 50th anniversary version of this movie, so I can't say whether or not the song was put back in, but I still think that (if you haven't seen this movie before) then it's definitely worth checking out.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Seven things I loved about JUNO:<br /><br />1.  The dialogue.  Uproariously funny.<br /><br />2.  Rainn Wilson's small part as Rollo, the store clerk.<br /><br />3.  For a 16-year-old, Juno makes some bravely mature choices after her initial irresponsibility.<br /><br />4.  Juno's faded \\"Slinky\\" t-shirt.<br /><br />5.  The soundtrack.  Not bad at all.<br /><br />6.  The one overtly \\"pro-life\\" character does not seem to be Hollywood's usual dreadful caricature of a minatory fire-breathing Bible-thumper; rather, she is an endearing Asian girl with a quiet manner and a slight problem forming past participles.  It made us smile.<br /><br />7.  (and this point is perhaps the most important)  There is a breadth of compassion in this film for quirky societal misfits that I find quite refreshing.<br /><br />Any points against the film?  Juno MacGuff is, shall we say, resolutely snarky, and some might find this a bit off-putting.  (I didn't find her off-putting in the least!)  The dialogue -- which I thought was hilarious -- can be lost on viewers of a different generation (I can picture some of my older relatives saying, \\"Thundercats are go?  What does that mean?  Something's going over my head.\\").  I had been warned by one viewer that this film did not live up to his expectations, or to the \\"hype.\\"  But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked Juno, the MacGuff family, and the offbeat universe of this film.  Recommended.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Amazing director, amazing cast, mind-blowing film. Everything from the visuals to the action to the heart and emotion are all fantastically done.
B000TGQDZQ|3.0|This album has some amazing tracks on it. The two that caught my attention the most are Never Enough, a great rock song with power and emotion and Chasing the Dragon, a bit of an epic with acoustic beginnings and a great powerful mid section and a quiet closing section. These two songs make this album place highly in my music collection. However on the whole the album isn't my style. I wish I could say I love this album but I'm not into the one aspect of this genre where the male vocalist growls or grunts. There is a fair amount of that on this album, along with what I call machine gun drums. If you like this, you'll love it, if you prefer the \\"all female\\" vocal style in this genre then this album may not be for you.<br /><br />I still play the songs I like often and this is a tremendous accomplishment for the band. Definitely worth a listen to see it you will like it.
0307454541|4.0|I'll jump on the bandwagon here - this is a very good read.  The writing is a bit<br />uneven, but it has a pretty tight and intricate plot.  It's one of those books that<br />will keep you up at night.  It could have been somewhat shorter however.  I'd<br />be giving things away if I was specific, but the book would have been the better<br />for being 2/3 its size.

B001VNB54A|4.0|While trying to decide whether to put this series on my wish list, I read loads of reviews here.<br /><br />Having read many of them I've come to this conclusion:<br /><br />1.) Many conservatives hate it because they think it's an evil Hollywood elitist plot to undermine the good name of our servicemen, rewrite history and prove how much Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and the rest of Hollywood actually hate America.<br /><br />2.) It has lots of sex scenes.<br /><br />3.) It isn't as good as Band of Brothers.<br /><br />I've never seen Band of Brothers (it's on my list). However, based solely on observations 1 and 2, I'm inclined to just buy it straightaway, as I'm pretty sure that means I'm going to like it.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|In January of 1967, California based rockers The Doors released its self-titled debut and was one of three spectacular debut albums released in '67, which also included debuts by Jimi Hendrix with Are You Experienced and of course Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.<br />The album was produced by Paul Rothchild and engineered by Bruce Botnick. The album saw the union of singer/poet Jim Morrison, guitarist Robbie Krieger, keyboard player Ray Manzarek and drummer John Densmore as those four men would change the landscape of rock and roll, as I found out in early 1987 when I inherited a cassette issue of this classic.<br />The opening track \\"Break On Through\\" is one of their most immediate tracks, featuring some of lead singer Jim Morrison's most memorable lyrics and on the 2000 (and this 2007 re-mixed) reissue, the song was finally released unedited with its \\"she get high\\" refrain which the word high was edited off of the original recording in 1967 for fear of drug references. Next is the catchy \\"Soul Kitchen\\" which is a great song. We follow with the melodic and tranquil \\"The Crystal Ship. Then we rock again with \\"Twntieth Century Fox\\". Next is the rollicking cover of an old German opera track \\"Alabama Song\\" which The Doors made their own. The 7 minute \\"Light My Fire\\" closes side one and was their first of two #1 hits and remains their signature track and a staple of rock radio. The long solos in the track, first by Manzarek and then by Krieger, are superb.On this new re-master the song is pitch corrected.<br />The blues of \\"Back Door Man\\" kicks off the second half of the album triumphantly. Next is the excellent \\"I Look at You\\" and the exquisite \\"End Of the Night\\". Then it is another classic \\"Take It As it Comes\\". The closing track is \\"The End\\" is one of the darkest epics recorded in rock history. This track is powerful and on this reissue, Jim unleashed a series of \\"f\\" bombs which were removed from the original vinyl release as swearing was a no-no in the 60s. Today, this album has held up well and doesn't sound like a nearly 45 year old record. I first got this album on cassette in late 1986 when I was 10 and loved it immediately. When it was re-released in 2007 on the Perception box and as a standalone, it was re-mixed and remastered by Botnick and has bonus tracks and the album at times sounds better than the original album.<br />Highly recommended!this album has held up well and doesn't sound like a nearly 45 year old record.

B003IY47JK|5.0|A friend recommended I get Lucidity. At the time I had no idea that it had guest vocals by Liv Kristine and Sharon Den Adel, among others. The blending of all the vocalists is amazing and the album is a wonderful collection of songs much like that of Within Temptation, but the album has it's on uinque sound. I wasn't nearly as impressed with the bands follow up album, April Rain, though it is still a good album...I just didn't like it as much as Lucidity.<br /><br />This is a great album of what I have humorously called female fronted symphonic gothic progressive rock.

B000MG1ZGA|5.0|The Doors' sixth album L.A. Woman was released in April of 1971.<br />The album was the band's last with original frontman Jim Morrison. The album was recorded after the band was banned from touring across much of the country after Jim got arrested for a disputed indecent exposure incident in Miami in 1969 (which may be thrown out of court now in 2010). As a result of controversy, the band (singer Jim Morrison, keyboard player Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robbie Krieger and drummer John Densmore) went in the studio with producer Paul Rothchild to record L.A. Woman. However, the band played through the run throughs of each track badly that Paul was bored to tears and walked out. As a result, engineer Bruce Botnick agreed to co-produce with the band and record at The Doors' Workshop. The result, a kick *ss album.<br />We open with the rocking \\"The Changeling\\" which was based on the life of a traveler and/or shape-shifter. Next is the album's Top 20 hit \\"Love Her Madly\\". Next is the kick*ss bluesy rock of \\"Been Down So Long\\". Next is \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" which is a nice tune. The first half ends with the epic title cut which is a great song, especially if you drive on an interstate.<br />\\"L'America\\" begins side two and is another winner. \\"Hyacinth House\\" follows and is another great song. Then we go bluesy again with \\"Crawling King Snake\\" which kicks *ss. Then we have one of the great Doors pieces out of \\"The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)\\". We close with the epic \\"Riders on the Storm\\" which is also the last song Jim recorded with the band and is rightfully a Doors classic.<br />The L.A. Woman album was a huge Top 10 hit and monster seller but unfortunately, lead singer/lyricist Jim Morrison passed away in July of 1971 in Paris but there are some reports that he may have faked his death as no one save his wife saw him when he passed, she would pass away in 1974 from a heroin overdose. This album is still a classic, even today. I first got this album on cassette when I was 10 and it still rocks today, especially the 2000 reissue from Elektra with the remastered/repackaged sticker on the sleeve.<br />In 2007, the album was re-released as part of the Perception box set with an excellent new stereo mix from Bruce Botnick and sounds excellent and includes two mammoth bonus track.<br />Highly recommended!it still rocks today, especially the 2000 reissue from Elektra with the remastered/repackaged sticker on the sleeve.

0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors. Few have the ability to translate complex ideas into something readable. Even fewer have the ability to do it well. Gladwell is one of those rarities.<br /><br />Outliers: The Story of Success is Gladwell's latest and arguably his best. In Outliers, Gladwell takes a look at select anecdotes of what makes for success. An interesting conundrum is that Outliers is potentially a misnomer. It should really be called Success: The Story of Outliers.<br /><br />Why? Statistically speaking, outliers are data that skew curves - they reside outside the normal bell curve which makes them special, and at times, a thorn in the side of researchers. Throw out an outlier and you might be labeled unethical. Keep it in, and your data may not accurately portray normal distributions.<br /><br />Yet outliers are perfectly normal and to be expected. In essence, they are the aberrant data points, like rolling double sixes six times in a row with a pair of dice, which, while rare, will happen eventually - a bit like why so-called \\"cancer clusters\\" are more likely explained as statistically abnormalities than for alleged environmental causes. A more thorough look at outliers as phenomena is Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, which looks at the effects in life of outliers.<br /><br />What Gladwell does is look at select outliers as personalities, such as Bill Gates, the Beatles, Jewish lawyers in New York and so on. His questions are: What makes them special, different and successful? In this way, his book is more about what makes for success rather than what makes for an outlier.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Gladwell's points remain. If you've read the rather cheesy book, The Luck Factor: The Four Essential Principles by Richard Wiseman, it's as if Gladwell found a parallel track with Wiseman. Success, they both say, relates to circumstance, perseverance and, perhaps most importantly, seizing opportunities which may not appear as opportunities at the time they are presented. (Wiseman tells you why you should always take opportunities presented if you want to be more successful in life.)<br /><br />Is it really that simple? Not really. It's actually far more enigmatic, and Gladwell as expected treats the subject with a great deal of thought. He concludes with this:<br /><br />\\"Superstar lawyers and math whizzes and software entrepreneurs appear at first blush to lie outside ordinary experience. But they don't. They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky - but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.\\"<br /><br />Gladwell is always a recommended read. His evaluations and conclusions of collections of attractive anecdotes in Outliers may be shocking to some - why a generation of Jewish lawyers in New York are so successful, why the month you were born may determine your success as a hockey player -- yet his treatment is always given considerable thought, which helps to put himself at the top of best-seller charts. Concluding with a chapter on his family history is particularly fitting considering Gladwell himself is an outlier.the time they are presented.

B000002O51|5.0|Boston's third album Third Stage was released in September of 1986.<br />By 1986, Boston was now down to two original members guitarist Tom Scholz whom also did bass guitar, keyboards and some of the drums and lead singer Brad Delp with original drummer Jim Masdea returning to play drums on the album. The album took eight years to create because of a court case that Tom had with CBS (now Sony) Records whom stopped paying him royalties because he took longer than usual to create Third Stage. In the end, Tom won the court case and went over to MCA which was being run at the time by Eagles manager Irving Azoff at the time.<br />The album kicks off with the #1 ballad \\"Amanda\\" which was the only song to go to #1 in 1986 without a video, something which should be learned in the music business. The rock radio staples on the album were \\"We're Ready\\" and the kick-*ss \\"Cool the Engines\\". The instrumental \\"The Launch\\" is awesome and I used to watch the speaker rumble during the beginning of this track. \\"My Destination\\" is seen as an Amanda Reprise but good nonetheless.<br />The second half kicks off with the killer medley of \\"A New World\\"/\\"To Be a Man\\". Then we have another killer rocker out of \\"I Think I Like It\\". Then we have the wonderful \\"Cant'cha Say/Still in Love\\" medley which is a great love song which was the third single from the album but released in edited form without the Still in Love bit. The closing ballad Hollyann's chorus has the same music pattern as Cant'cha Say but a semi-tone lower and a slower tempo but a great song. I had this on cassette as a child but now sounds great on CD.<br />Third Stage was an instant smash going all the way to #1 on the album charts where it reigned for four weeks. When fans opened this album up and gave it a spin, as I did on my 11th birthday in 1987, millions were in for a treat. Hey Universal, how about a remaster! Highly recommended!

B003DT19F0|3.0|While overall the movie is suitable for all ages it lacked the magic of Disney.  The voice acting was very good and of course Disney has superb animation, but the story line was a little weak.  It just wasn't as good as the the first two Tinker Bell movies.  Good enough to buy?  Yes, I suppose so, but I can't give a high recommendation.

B000VWOV3O|4.0|The Mahavishnu Orchestra was a fusion project led by jazz guitarist John McLaughlin.  Even on full-blown jazz records, McLaughlin's blistering solos contained clear rock influences; he owed as much to Jimi Hendrix as he owed to Grant Green or Kenny Burrell.  But Mahavishnu allowed him to show that he could be a rock guitar god and so much more.  Here's what you'll get from the boxed set:    1) Inner Mounting Flame (1972 studio release)  2) Birds of Fire (1973 studio release)  3) Between Nothingness and Eternity (1973 live release)    While the titles and album-sleeve poetry pointed east, the sound of his crunching rock quintet mostly pointed west: Billy Cobham on drums, Jerry Goodman on violin, a tasteful version of Jan Hammer on keyboard, and Rick Laird on bass.  The early music lacked vocals, but rock fans might notice similarities to the jam portions of songs by early Black Sabbath or by Wetton-era King Crimson, especially on the first of the three quartet recordings.    4) Apocalypse (1974 studio release)    The quintet fell apart quickly.  McLaughlin took a break to record a different sort of jazz-fusion album with Carlos Santana -- see [[ASIN:B0018BF1D6 Original Album Classics]] -- and then formed a new version of his group with much more emphasis on the \\"orchestra\\" part of the name.  Not only did the group expand to an octet, if you go by the people listed in the liner notes, they teamed with Michael Tilson Thomas and the London Symphony Orchestra (under the guidance of middle-brow impresario George Martin of Beatles fame) so that their jazzy excursions would have a classical-music backdrop.      5) Visions of the Emerald Beyond (1975 studio release)    The orchestral Mahavishnu is not bad if you go for that sort of thing -- with the haunting female vocals and electric violin of Jean-Luc Ponty, it makes for popular morning music in my household -- but McLaughlin apparently grew frustrated with the pomp of his new collaboration.  He scaled back for the last album in this collection, with the classical duties devolving to a mere string trio (with an occasional trumpet or flute or flugelhorn thrown in).  Critical reaction to the album was not as kind as it deserved ... it's again a great album, if you're OK with music that is so self-consciously artisic and you are not comparing it unfairly to the early version of the band.  But McLaughlin took a 180-degree turn afterward, picking up his acoustic and three Indian pals to form the legendary Shakti, and I've never heard anyone suggest he took a wrong turn there.  To hear the magic they created, you'll need to pick up the McLaughlin box in this series: [[ASIN:B000UH8BT0 Original Album Classics]].

B003YWUTJI|4.0|Norah Jones came out with her first album while I was in college. I loved her voice and style, so I was super excited for the opportunity to review her latest album Featuring. If the name isn't a dead giveaway, this album features a wide assortment of musical collaborations.<br /><br />\\"A lot of the people on this record are people I've worshiped since I was a kid, and some of them are younger and more my contemporaries,\\" says Norah. \\"Even though the musicians are so varied, the vibe of the songs makes sense when we put them all together.\\"<br /><br />It's not every day that Dolly Parton, Outkast, and the Foo Fighters appear on the same album. Norah Jones ties it all together. Although the songs are as different as the artists themselves, they do fit together nicely. I think one of my favorites is \\"More Than This\\" by Charlie Hunter. I also liked \\"Court & Spark\\" by Herbie Hancock.<br /><br />I thought this was a thoroughly enjoyable album - perfect for a rainy afternoon with a cup of hot tea. For some reason, Norah Jones always makes me feel like I'm in a coffee house, she just has a nice laid back mellow vibe in her music.<br /><br />I received a complimentary album to facilitate my review as part of the One2One campaign. The opinions expressed are my honest thoughts of the product.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet.  I am 46 years old and I own 1,100 CD's.  My favorite bands are Pink Floyd, Tool, and Rush.  Porcupine Tree takes the best elements of each of these 3 bands and incorporates it in each of their songs.  I recently discovered PT about 3 weeks ago and I can't get enough of this band!!! I initially bought The Incident, Deadwing, Recordings, Fear of a Blank Planet, and the live DVD Anesthesize.  My favorite song is anesthesize and my favorite CD is fear of a blank planet.  The drumming and guitar playing are mind blowing...I just can't get enough of this band which I call a hidden gem!!!! I've been sleeping 2 hours a night because I've been listening to PT for 22 hours per day.  I just ordered everything else in their catalog.  they are quickly becoming one of my favorite bands of all time.
B003Y7L5W8|4.0|It was 1985, and this song called \\"So In Love\\" was playing in frequent rotation on the radio. At age 12, I liked it, but it didn't register yet. Flash forward to 1986, \\"Pretty In Pink\\" is released and \\"If You Leave\\" shoots up the charts. Great song, now I know who OMD are (or so I think). Flash forward to Christmas 1986, my cousins get me a cassette tape (yes, remember those?) of \\"The Pacific Age\\" (I know what you're thinking already). I listen to it over and over and decide, yes, I like OMD. Flash forward to 1988, \\"Dreaming\\" is released, and it is just okay, I think. Then the break-up. I find \\"Sugar Tax\\" as an import and wonder is this THE OMD? Sure enough, Andy McCluskey pulls a Tears For Fears, and continues on with the band's moniker even though he is the only remaining member of the original band.<br /><br />And so on and so forth. In the early 2000's I get \\"Navigation: The B-Sides\\" and go back and get everything pre-\\"The Pacific Age\\", and I am struck by how talented this New Wave band was, and that in America, they were given short shrift, only being known, truly, for \\"If You Leave\\", when they are so much more than that.<br /><br />2005, OMD re-forms, and promise of a new album starts to percolate. 2010, finally, \\"The History Of Modern\\"--except it isn't so modern. No, reports state many of these tracks were written before the re-formation, some of them were rejected from Andy McCluskey's pet projects, others were started back in the early 1980's, and still more were started in the 1990's. Hmmm.<br /><br />Well, let's put it this way: I am very happy to have OMD back. It was time for all these current bands who are directly borrowing from greats like OMD, to see how it's done. Bands like White Lies, The Postal Service, Empire Of The Sun, The Killers, Keane, to name but a few.<br /><br />\\"History Of Modern\\" is the first time in 24 years the original four members have worked on an album together, and the first OMD album in 14 years. With 14 tracks, there are bound to be some great tracks and some weak ones.<br /><br />So let me get the weak ones out of the way first. \\"Sometimes\\" has to be the weakest track here. The refrain \\"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child\\" over and over gets real tiresome as moaned by either Jennifer John or Lucy Styles. Very annoying, along with the hip-hop record scratching, this song is the worst track here. The other track, as much as I like Aretha Franklin, is \\"Save Me\\". I didn't feel like it belonged here, and it didn't. It's a bonus track on the U.S. edition.<br /><br />Now the great songs: \\"New Babies: New Toys\\" is a great album opener that doesn't just have trademark OMD synths, but some guitar heft as well. \\"If You Want It\\" is a solid ballad that follows. My favorite track on the entire album is \\"History Of Modern, Pt.1\\". This is what OMD does best, and I think to myself, Coldplay gets all over the radio with \\"Viva La Vida\\", a song that's not that far removed from \\"History Of Modern, Pt.1\\", but OMD get no airplay. Hmmm. \\"History Of Modern, Pt.2\\" rounds out the first four tracks very nicely. Then we're hit with \\"Sometimes\\", followed by the okay tracks \\"RFWK\\" and \\"New Holy Ground\\".<br /><br />The second half of the album starts with an almost disco sounding \\"The Future, The Past, And Forever After\\" which is okay. \\"Sister Marie Says\\" has been compared to \\"Enola Gay\\", and I get the comparison, but \\"Sister Marie Says\\" still has enough about it to set it apart from \\"Enola Gay\\". Still, it's an okay song. Now, I know I'm going to hear complaints about this, but I actually liked \\"Pulse\\". I thought it was a different style that OMD actually did quite well. In fact, as I listened to it, I thought of Duran Duran, and that \\"Pulse\\" could have been taken from their 2007 album \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" (take note Duran Duran, you're being reviewed in February 2011 with your new album). \\"Green\\" is good, and so is \\"Bondage Of Fate\\". My second favorite track is \\"The Right Side?\\" Sprawling out to eight minutes,this song gets the Kraftwerk treatment, and perhaps the closest track to a Human League track musically (take note Human League, you will be reviewed when your new album is released in March 2011).<br /><br />On first listen, the album sounded better than it actually was. With repeated listening, I felt I came up with a more accurate rating for this album. It has some very good tracks, quite a few okay tracks, and a couple of undesirable tracks. There is a good deal of variety here, so nothing to get bored with. Overall, a very strong return to form for a band that has not worked on an album in 24 years! Also, like always, prior to listening to \\"History Of Modern\\", and went back to the beginning and listened to each OMD album in sequential order so as to hear how the band changed over the years. \\"History Of Modern\\" is definitely a mash of up of all different phases of their career with a heavier leaning towards their middle and late career rather than their first four albums (I know this may disappoint some fans, but I like all phases of OMD).<br /><br />So here is how \\"History Of Modern\\" rates next to their previous works:<br /><br />1980 Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark: Four Stars<br />1980 Organisation: Four and a Half Stars<br />1981 Architecture & Morality: Five Stars<br />1983 Dazzle Ships: Five Stars<br />1984 Junk Culture: Four Stars<br />1985 Crush: Three and a Half Stars<br />1986 The Pacific Age: Three and a Half Stars<br />1991 Sugar Tax: Three and a Half Stars<br />1993 Liberator: Two and a Half Stars<br />1996 Universal: Four Stars<br />2010 History Of Modern: Four Starsthis song gets the Kraftwerk treatment, and perhaps the closest track to a Human League track musically (take note Human League, you will be reviewed when your new album is released in March 2011).<br /><br />On first listen, the album sounded better than it actually was.

B000002J0N|5.0|I have to admit to being biased about Crosby Stills and Nash, I have practically everything they've recorded, together and individually.  However, I can be terribly dissapointed when they fail to live up to what they're all about and they certainly have hit some \\"sour notes\\" on some latter recordings.  For me, this album pretty much sums up everything I like about them: soulfulness, beauty and simplicity. CSN is a subtle treasure, never over-produced, a study in restraint.  There is a musical sophistication here that's truly amazing. The subject matter of the songs is very deep, very moving. One writer described Still's contributions as \\"personal exorcisims\\".  Crosby's songs are brutally honest and Nash reached his creative peak on this record. Vocally, they never sounded better, the harmonies soar. A big factor in this album's sucess is the keyboard work of Craig Doerge.  His playing brings a meeting point between jazz and folk styles that blend beautifully.  I really think CSN took this album to a whole other level.  Their maturity as musicians has never been more evident.
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|This is Daniel Craig's second picture as James Bond and there are some carry-over characters from \\"Casino Royale\\" -- Mr. White (a bad guy) and Mathias (an old MI-6 agent) and Felix Leiter (CIA).    It appears there's a new threat to world peace in the form of \\"Quantum\\" -- a secret organization that has infilrtated the highest levels of the world's governments, including British Intelligence.  This is an all action film.  Apparently, Bond has slowed down in his feminine conquests after Vesper's death in \\"Casino Royale\\" -- he beds the British Embassy woman who's to escort him out of Bolivia and she's later killed by Quantum -- but the heroine, Camille (Olga Kurylenko) relains chaste. Mathieu Amalric is Dominic Greene, an ecological master villian out to corner whole countries' water supplies.     Eon Productions really went all out on the action and special effects.  This is a non-stop action film and Craig must've gotten more than his share of real cuts, scrapes, and bruises.  I give this 4 stars.  This film is best seen with its predecessor \\"Casino Royale\\" to help tie ends together.

0142405809|5.0|This book was given to us, and I will admit the looks did not appeal to me.  It was a flimsy paperback and the cover illustration made me think it was more an informational coloring book.  Boy was I wrong!  The story is long and windy, but very melodic and rythmic and I love reading it over and over.  I had to explain some things to the children as they were unfamiliar with certain aspects of the story, but they enjoyed it and have asked for it again and again.  It is not going to be hold the interests of a child who likes one line per page, but it does have full illustrations on every page, and when a child is ready for a little more of a story, they will love this one.  I am so happy I was wrong about it.

B002ZG9968|5.0|Even though critics weren't kind in their reviews of this film, I loved it - particularly the acting, which was authentic and superb.  Alex O'Loughlin is a terrific leading man, and after seeing this film I was motivated to watch his \\"Moonlight\\" Series on DVD and start watching him on Hawaii 5-0.  The only downside for me were the scenes in the support group, particularly the birthing scene.  When I watch the film on DVD I skip through all scenes containing the support group. It's over-the-top stupid and offensive in my opinion and makes the difficulty of child birth seem like a joke.  But the dog playing \\"Nuts\\" and the sweet romantic scenes make this film worth watching.
B003EV6DBM|2.0|Much as I loved David Tennant's Doctor Who, I was open to the new team of Matt Smith (as DW) and Stephen Moffat (as director). I liked the first episode, but grew to increasingly dislike the new team as I watched more episodes. I have now reached the point where I loathe Smith.<br /><br />In a way, I can't exactly blame him because Smith is too young to be Doctor Who. Maybe it's his limitation as an actor, but 27-year-old Matt Smith portrays Doctor Who as a 27-year-old or even younger. His Doctor Who lacks wisdom (that can only come from age and experience), passion and brilliance of intellect (which Tennant had in loads), and the sadness of being the last of his species and of having seen so much suffering and misery.<br /><br />Instead, Smith's Doctor Who is physically gawky (like some bumbling teenager), not particularly brilliant (how many times did Amy, a 20-year-old earthling with neither education nor special training, come up with the solution to their predicament? Puleese), and most offensive of all, is rude (telling others to \\"Shut Up!) and RESORTS TO VIOLENCE (which violates Doctor Who's very nature).<br /><br />I'm also weary of how Moffat and the writers make every episode incomplete -- they continue on and bleed into each other. No episode is truly a stand-alone episode.<br /><br />If Smith and Moffat continue what they've done in this season, I will no longer watch Doctor Who. It has become a \\"Saturday morning\\" cartoon for little kiddies.
0374158460|3.0|What is freedom? Franzen seems not to know. The novel seems to be saying there's no such thing as freedom in today's world -- increased GDP, advancements in technology as well as our very natures keep us from realizing true freedom. I understand his point, but it's sort of like a half-empty glass viewpoint. Sometimes I think the only way we know the true meaning of freedom is when it is taken away. Interestingly, I read Out of Captivity: Surviving 1,967 Days in the Columbian Jungle right after finishing Freedom. It's pretty mind-blowing to compare the two books. One of course is fictional and the other a true account of Americans (and others) losing their freedom. But I feel as though Franzen's theories and ruminations on freedom make him seem like Socrates' prisoners from Plato's cave who sit and watch shadows on the wall.  Sure puts things in perspective - I recommend reading it to anyone who feels a bit depressed after reading Freedom.
0375701427|5.0|Philip Roth's Pulitzer-Prize winning novel \\"American Pastoral\\" (1997) tells the story of Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov and his life of tragedy beneath every outward sign of success.  I thought it might be painful to read this book, with its twin focus on the decade of the 1960s and the War in Vietnam and on the much visited preoccupation, novelistic and otherwise, with the nature of Jewish identity.  Both subjects can still be raw for me. Roth handles them in this novel with thought, reflectiveness, and a substantial degree of compassion. Although I have had mixed feelings regarding other books of Roth, \\"American Pastoral\\" held my interest and emotion. It is a masterful, nuanced work.<br /><br />The book is set in Newark, the New Jersey suburbs, and in the relatively isolated, rural, western part of the state in a town called Old Rimrock. The story is written by Roth's frequently-used \\"Zukerman\\" personna. Zukerman has a large role in the first third of the book as the readers sees his relationship to Swede and to Swede's irascible younger brother who has become a much-divorced successful cardiac surgeon in Florida. Zuckerman recounts in the body of the book Swede's life, or what the reader is given to understand Zuckerman has learned of it.  Zuckerman does not appear in his own person after the first section of the novel.<br /><br />Swede Levov is the third generation of the family that has gradually built a flourishing business in the manufacture of gloves in Newark. As a high school student, Swede is an extraordinary athlete who letters in three sports, an anomaly in the New Jersey Jewish community of the 1930's \\"whose elders, largely undereducated and overburdened, venerated academic achievement above all else.\\" (p. 3) An unabashed lover of the United States, Swede enlists in the marines only to see WW II come to an end before he sees any action, graduates from college, turns down a baseball contract, and succeeds his domineering father as the owner of the glove factory.  An obedient son to his father, Swede acts with true independence on only one occasion of his life: his marriage to Dawn Dyer, a Catholic and a former Miss New Jersey and participant in the Miss America pageant. (While in the marines, Swede had, at his father's urging, terminated an earlier engagement to a non-Jewish woman.)Swede and Dawn move to Old Rimrock, a change from their earlier urban life, to life in a large old stone house while Dawn pursues her dream of independence in becoming a successful cattle farmer. The couple have a difficult daughter, Merry, who stutters and tends to go her own way.<br /><br />With the trauma of the Vietnam years and the violence of American cities, including Newark the adolescent Merry becomes violent and a radical. She bombs a store in Old Rimrock, killing an esteemed local physician. Then, she runs off and winds up in Oregon where she engages in more bombing and kills three people.  When Swede finds his daughter after five years, she is thin, emaciated, living in filth and announces that she has become a Jain.  The denoument of the book takes place during a long, tense, dinner party, described in detail, that Swede and Dawn host for Swede's parents and various family friends with whom they share relationships, sexual and otherwise.<br /><br />For all the violence and the disruption of the 1960s, Roth offers a fondly nostalgic portrayal of American life. The Jewish community of New Jersey is shown is hardworking, family-oriented and patriotic, in contrast to some less complimentary portrayals in Roth's earlier books which emphasize difficulties with sex. They want what is best for their families and try to behave with dignity and probity. The glove and tanning industries are described in detail, emphasizing the hard-working character of the Levovs as well as their limitations.  Of the people shown in the book, none have any attachment to the religious aspects of Judaism. Yet the community is close-knit with strong ethnic Jewishidentification.<br /><br />Swede Levov's own personal tragedies, focusing on the murders committed by his daughter, followed by the depression and unfaithfulness of Dawn, mirror the disintegration of American life during the 1960s.  The book deplores the Vietnam War and the violence of the cities but there it offers the sense that America has lost its moorings by forgetting some of the earlier values that the Levovs, as well as Dawn Dyer's family had held dear. Roth shows great sympathy with the work ethic even while he continues to develop themes of his earlier books on matters pertaining to sexuality and its repression.  The book offers no answers for the way Merry behaves. Neither Dawn nor Swede are criticized for abandoning their religions or for their marriage, although this subject gets examined and discussed in detail.  The book evidences a pessimism for the America of the 1960s with perhaps a hope of a recapture of some of the strengths of an earlier generation.<br /><br />The book moves back and forth between Swede's life in the 1960s and his earlier life as athletic hero, clean-cut young man, and obedient son. Many of the other characters in the book, as it unfolds, are developed with a great deal of insight.  Although it includes much of Roth's sardonic humor and satire, \\"American Pastoral\\"  is a disturbing, serious novel which struggles valiantly and sympathetically with questions about the nature and modern continuation of the American dream.<br /><br />Robin Friedman's own personal tragedies, focusing on the murders committed by his daughter, followed by the depression and unfaithfulness of Dawn, mirror the disintegration of American life during the 1960s.

0525423273|5.0|This one kept me up till the wee hours because I couldn't put it down till I finished.  From reading reviews, I knew it was going to be a romance between the main character Anna who is sent to boarding school in Paris and her new friend, a guy named St Clair who has a longtime girlfriend.  What I didn't expect was for the girlfriend to be still in the picture for the majority of the book - prepare for some frustration!!  Considering this, I was a little surprised that in the pre-reviews I read that everyone thought St Clair was such a great guy as his behavior continually disappointed me.  Many times I just wanted Anna (who I loved) to tell him to PISS.OFF. and move on!  His unwillingness to end his failing relationship was understandable at first but at a certain point in his relationship with Anna it was just getting cruel and unexplainable.  He redeemed himself in the end however I could have used a better explanation than \\"I was confused\\".  The relationships in this book are all flawed and complex and overall it was an excellent read!

B002N5N5R0|4.0|Some excellent TV - outstanding cast and very good storyline.  I originally thought this was an HBO or Showtime series and expected more nudity/sexuality.  It is an FX series in the PG-13 realm similar to 'Rescue Me'.  The writers have gone to great lengths to make the outlaw bikers into the good guys (and they come accross that way) and the ememies of the club are convincing bad guys.  The Feds come up with a 'love-to-hate' villan in an attractive female ATF agent who is ruthless and unprincipled.  Easy to root for the outlaws when the cops and feds and \\"upstanding citizens\\" are portrayed as such moronic creeps.  Overall excellent - would be outstanding in an \\"R\\" rated version.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|As an avid television fan, I have watched many a critically acclaimed TV show... and enjoyed most of them.     Honestly, I began watching Mad Men because I was sick of it winning all the awards that I wanted \\"LOST\\" to win.  I just had to see what the buzz was about.    I started Season One less than a month ago, and have all ready watched through the end of Season Four.     In my experience, in order for a TV show to work, it has to make you care about it's characters. The creators of Mad Men have done this with impeccable finesse. The characters in the show are almost excruciatingly human. They are jaded and flawed in such away that anyone can relate to them.  The writers took time to show some of the key characters' back stories, which helps explain what makes them tick.    You will find yourself entranced by the seduction of these characters, even if you don't agree with many of the things that they do.  They make mistakes... they fail... sometimes they succeed. And you will be pulling for them all the way.    The quality of Mad Men does not belong on Television.  Every episode is like watching a very well put together movie that took years to perfect. From the script, to the music, to the cinematography.     This show makes all other \\"great\\" television seem mediocre. Yes. Even LOST.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I bought this thinking it was going to be like the Band of Brothers mini series, also put out by HBO.  I was wrong in my predetermined thinking.  It is a wonderfully put together story.  However, it is not like the Band of Brothers, in the sense that that particular story is unique and bonding.  This story is bonding, but it takes a while for character development, since it only focused on about 6 individuals, you would think it would be more in depth.  Still, overall, a must have for anyone's collection.

As a voice teacher myself, I love when my students want to singer her music, because most of them can.

0140277447|5.0|Even those of us in the \\"older generation\\" heard little of the Sino-Japanese War. The brutality the Japanese exhibited in their 6 year occupancy of China ranked with that of Hitler and Stalin and ranks with the more recent genocides in Tibet, Rwanda and Darfur. It may have been worse.<br />In this highly readable, extraordinarily well researched work, the actions and treachery of the Japanese occupiers of China and Nanking are revealed in vivid detail. In one of those strange ironies, it was a German Nazi, John Rabe, who was totally unaware of Hitler's actions in Germany who created a \\"safe zone\\" that prevented the carnage from being worse.This hero died in obscurity in Germany.His carefully chronicled diaries provide vivid documentation of the events.<br /><br />The reason this is historically important is it forms the basis of the current hostility between China and Japan...unlike Germany, the Japanese never had to make reparations to China, nor apologize. There were no Nuremberg Trials to bring justice.  The Japanese have white washed their history books and have tried to pretend these actions never occurred. The West was complicit in this due to their fear of the Communist regimes in Russia and later China after Mao defeated Chiang Kai-shek who withdrew to Taiwan. Whether the witnessed brutality of the Japanese on defenseless Chinese was the \\"program\\" which triggered Mao's later brutality in China during the \\"Cultural Revolution\\" and the subsequent genocide in Tibet is a matter of conjecture. Despite the fact that most of the players are now dead, animosity remains between these countries for justifiable reasons.<br />While this in no way condones the actions of the Chinese on their own citizens of on the Tibetans, it may explain the unexplainable.

0670021652|5.0|COMMITTED by Elizabeth Gilbert is a follow-up to her runaway bestseller, EAT PRAY LOVE (see also Section 4A).<br /><br />It takes her from the end of the first book--when she falls in love with Felipe--to their life afterward . . . all was going smoothly until he was detained by the U.S. government, which then gave the couple a choice . . . either they needed to get married or Felipe would never again be allowed to enter into the country.<br /><br />That became problematic, in that both individuals had said they'd never get married again because of their previous marriages . . . however, as much thought and realizing they didn't have many other options, they did choose the marriage route.<br /><br />It took them some ten months to cut through all the details that were required and during that time, Gilbert devoted herself to the study of matrimony . . . she read everything she could about the subject and, also, spoke to countless individuals throughout the world.<br /><br />That was the part about COMMITTEED that I liked least . . . what I liked most were the parts that the author devoted to her life with Felipe . . . I became interested in their lives and enjoyed reading about how Gilbert sought help from one border guard:<br /><br />* \\"What would you do now, if you were in our situation,\\" I asked. This is a technique I've learned to use over the years whenever I find myself at an impasse with a dispassionate customer service operator or an apathetic bureaucrat. Phrasing the sentence in such a manner invites the person who has all the power to pause for a moment and put himself in the shoes of the person who is powerless. It's a subtle appeal to empathy. Sometimes it helps. Most of the time, to be honest, it doesn't help at all. But I was willing to try anything here.<br /><br />I also enjoyed reading about their love story, including this following passage:<br /><br />* Then Felipe's eyes filled with tears and he said, \\"Thank you for coming into my life. No matter what happens now, no matter what you decide to do next, just know that you've given me the two most joyful years I've ever known, and I will never forget you.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, as was the case the first book, there were parts that had me smiling--such as when Gilbert described the issue of wedding gifts:<br /><br />* As Miss Manners once coolly explained to a reader, the proper technique for congratulating a serial bride-to-be is to eschew all gifts and galas and simply write the lady a note expressing how very delighted you are for her happiness, wishing her all the luck in the world, and being very careful to avoid using the words \\"this time.\\"<br /><br />I hope that there's at least a third book about this couple, covering how their life in New Jersey has turned out for them.o next, just know that you've given me the two most joyful years I've ever known, and I will never forget you.\\"     Lastly, as was the case the first book, there were parts that had me smiling--such as when Gilbert described the issue of wedding gifts:     * As Miss Manners once coolly explained to a reader, the proper technique for congratulating a serial bride-to-be is to eschew all gifts and galas and simply write the lady a note expressing how very delighted you are for her happiness, wishing her all the luck in the world, and being very careful to avoid using the words \\"this time.\\"     I hope that there's at least a third book about this couple, covering how their life in New Jersey has turned out for them.
B0044KU7KU|2.0|Despite a 4-year hiatus, My Chemical Romance didn't have their feet set when they wrote this album. Conflicting statements by singer Way (\\"The band misses being a rock band\\"-2008 \\"We realized it was okay to make a dance album.\\" -2010) indicate this struggle. Not surprisingly, the results are a peg below mixed, with four (4!), ineffective ballads, a dizzingly inept crack at Franz Ferdinand-inspired swing, and toothless rockers dotting the homely landscape. Only \\"Na Na Na,\\" \\"Bulletproof Heart,\\" and \\"Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back,\\" pump life into this dud. If this is what 2019 sounds like, I'm in no rush to get there.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound Of Music never looked so good.  The picture quality is excellent and the sound much improved.    The extras are a geat addtion to the package.  I wish they had the overture to the film included.   At any rate, this is one not to be missed.  Your family will love it over and over.
B001VNB54A|3.0|Just finished watching this series. Its good but for sure not as good as Band of Brothers. A few very poor episodes combined with a few good ones are not making this mini series a must have/see. I expected better from Hanks and Spielberg.
B000002JSN|5.0|The double album Physical Graffiti (1975) is my favorite Zeppelin album.  The songs vary so much in style and type.  This album came out when Led Zeppelin was at their peak.  Every song is great, but my personal favorites are In My Time Of Dying, Ten Years Gone, The Wanton Song, The Rover, Night Flight, Down By The Seaside, and Sick Again.  I think John Paul Jones was at his best on this album - on bass and keyboards and all the other instruments he used.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin is a band that never took the easy way out.  What I mean is that they didn't record songs that all sounded the same like so many bands do.  So many bands go into a studio and keep everything very basic and hardly ever experiment with different instruments.  You know what I mean - you can play a ten-song album and the guitar on all the tracks sounds the same as the first track.  The song structures/arrangements are the same.  Even a lot of the melodies will sound the same, just with different lyrics.  Then there's always that screeching metal guitar solo in the middle of the song that we've all heard 34 million times before.  Led Zeppelin never did this.  All their songs sound different from one another.  They put the time and effort into experimenting and making every song sound different.  That's why they're generally regarded as the greatest of all the hard rock bands.<br /><br />I highly recommend Physical Graffiti as a good starter album if you're just getting into Led Zeppelin.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|I had heard good things about the show, so I bought season 1 to try it out. It was even better than I expected! Very funny, smart, and sweet. Loved every episode!
B002VKE1K2|1.0|This movie is utter trash.<br /><br />Only insidious is of this class and watchable.<br /><br />This movie is so bad I wanted to demand my money back and some compensation for the insult of watching it.<br /><br />Now it is spawning copycats like seance the summoning and TV or theaters are not classifying the budget low quality jobs like this to the consumer can't tell easily.
B00000IMTH|4.0|Long Live Rock 'n' Roll (1978) is a pretty darn good Rainbow album.  One good reason is that Ronnie James Dio was on vocals.  He was (and is) one of the great hard rock/heavy metal singers of all time.  This album's top tracks in my opinion are the title track, Kill The King, and my personal favorite, Gates Of Babylon.  While this album is quite different from and doesn't measure up to Rainbow Rising (in my opinion, their best album), it's still a very good album.  There are a lot of good melodies.  The CD sleeve comes with complete lyrics to all the songs.<br /><br />If you want one of the better Rainbow albums and an album that has Ronnie James Dio on vocals, then this is a good selection along with Rainbow Rising (1976) and Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow (1975).

B0044XV3R8|2.0|I have been a fan of this movie until I saw a Japanese animation film Princess Mononoke, which was completed in 1997.  The story line is incredibly identical...  Sent chill to my spine.  I am quite disappointed with this infringement of copy right.  Cameron may be excellent to creat great movies with advanced technology.  But his originality and digity as a one-of-a-kind director and writer truly took a nose dive...
B003NFM3JU|1.0|I have purchased two copies of this dvd and one was from wal-mart.com and today I received a copy from Disney dvd club. Neither one of the 3d discs will work. I have the samsung 3d tv,3d blueray player, so I have the right equipment but cannot get it to play. And off course Disney customer service is only open when everyone else is working. The regular discs work fine. Can any give me some suggestions?
B002JVWQT6|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show. It's hilarious & I got it in Blu-Ray which makes it even better.  Love this product and I can't wait to buy the 2nd Season. :)
B003ELNV9Y|5.0|I must  admit that I was blown away by \\"Emotion and Commotion\\". Jeff Beck has always been a virtuosso with his instrument,but on this album I truly believe he has bared his soul.It is the first album in a long time that I could play from beginning to end,and love every cut. For him to cover \\"I Put a Spell On You\\" and follow that with Nessun Dorma is quite a feat. In addition,I was also impressed with his young bassist Tal Wilkenfeld. Beck has always surrounded himself with great bassists,from Mo Foster on,and she doesn't disappoint. Thanks Jeff,for a truly great effort.
0810993139|5.0|I purchased the series for my preteen and decided to see what all the hype was about.  I read the book in one sitting and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It's been a while since a book made me laugh that much.  While reading the Diary, I recalled my own middle school days - and I smiled because some of the characters from Mr. Kinney's book reminded me of people from my own school days.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|I would like to thankyou for the great service and movie. I would buy again from you. And if you are selling more movies I would like to see them . Keep up the good work
B002EWD0I6|5.0|Once again BBC proves to be ahead of everyone when it comes to costume dramas and adaptations. This successful series has opened a new window for those lovers of period stories and I cannot stop praising it and watching it. A perfect cast lead by Julia Sawalha, Olivia Hallinan, Brendan Coyle, Claudie Blackley, Linda Basset and Dawn French bring to life Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novels as it tells the story of the people and families living between the rural humble town of Lark Rise and the growing market town of Candleford.   Julia Sawalha plays Miss Dorcas Lane, an exceptional woman that not only runs Candleford's Post Office successfully, but also seems to be the very person everyone turns to whenever there is a problem in town. There's plenty of drama, humor and romance and all the characters have their own stories and issues spinning around the Post Office. The series takes place in the late 1800´s which presents a very beautiful production of lovely houses, open fields, corsets and outstanding costumes!   If you´re in the mood for an easy to watch, sweet and spicy brand new old fashioned period show, \\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\" fits perfectly. I highly recommend it, for I loved it!
0393072231|3.0|If you want to understand what happened during the financial crisis, this is a must read, but don't come away thinking that this will make you an expert on what happened.  It's a great story, unfolding through the eyes of various investors and analysts who began to piece together what was really going on.  Some of these folks were truly contrarians, outliers from the mainstream because of their jaundice and cynicism or in one case, because of a disability.  But this makes you wonder -- who is piecing together the real story right now about what is happening with gold or Apple or chinese state companies?  We suspect that bubbles might be forming all of the time, but almost by definition, the heroes in any short-selling story are going to be misanthropes betting against their fellow human beings.  So that's the first point I'd make -- don't think there are any real heroes in this story.  There were some people who figured out the risks that other people were taking faster than most others did, and they made money off this knowledge or they caused other people to lose money, housing, etc. and all that goes with it.    The second point is that the Big Short is an extended magazine article; a first draft of history.  It's not meant to be exhaustive.  So Lewis might not talk about John Paulsen all that much, or he might not get into all of the mechanics of what Goldman did to flip so neatly onto the right side of the bet.  He also doesn't really get into the importance of re-capitalizing the banks, the interconnectedness of the financial system, the moral hazard problems, and the mechanics of helping out bad financial institutions because you want to make sure the relatively good ones don't get swept away with the tide.  If you read the Big Short, you kind of need the back story on AIG's relationship with Goldman, the way Moodys, S&P, et.al. do their thing, and the real limitations on the SEC and Treasury -- sure there was some incompetence, but there were also rules andlaws and regulations to follow that might not have made a lot of sense in a rapidly evolving industry, but they still had to be followed.  So my second point is, there's a lot of back story that gets glossed over, but which is helpful to know to put what Lewis says in context.    Still, this was the most accessible book I read on the crisis, and I absolutely recommend it.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is a must.  So in depth.  Great back stories.  Great interviews that have never been seen.  You think you know everhything,but you dont!

B003XJDT1W|5.0|I bought [[ASIN:B001I10AAA The Foundation]] and [[ASIN:B0039OC0O8 Pass The Jar]] back in May, and have thoroughly enjoyed them (including the Pass the Jar DVD).  When this CD was released I decided it was time to order another Zac Brown Band CD.  And, I have thoroughly enjoyed this one as well.    I will admit, when I first played it, it wasn't love at first hear.  But it was a strong like.  But, as I've played it more and more, I'm liking it more and more.  I'm almost thinking I like it more than The Foundation.  Like The Foundation, this CD has a variety of different songs, some fun, some serious.    Locally, \\"As She's Walking Away\\" is getting all the airplay, and that is understandable, as it's a good song.  But in my opinion, \\"Cold Hearted\\", \\"Colder Weather\\", \\"Martin\\", \\"Oh My Sweet Carolina\\",  and \\"Nothing\\" are all equally good, and some better.  And, this CD has my favorite from Pass the Jar, \\"Who Knows\\", a great rockin song.    And I would recommend buying the Deluxe addition.  The extra songs on it are worth the extra dollars, in my opinion.    Buy this CD, you'll enjoy it.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|You're 80 years old. You've won every honor available in your chosen profession. On the side you are a talented and knowledgeable composer and musician.  You always have something interesting to say through your work.  So I'm going to cut Clint Eastwood some slack, a whole lot of slack.  If he wants to ponder what comes next for him and for all of us, that's just fine with me and I'm going to watch while he does it.  It turns out I did it for Hereafter on the day of my mother's expected death at a few years older than Clint.  So I was an easy mark for the emotions of Hereafter, which are -- to be honest -- kind of predictable and manipulative, but also very entertaining.  The opening scene, by now famous, is awesome (and not in the overused slangy sense) and I'm glad to see Matt Damon and Eastwood working together again.  Neither Hereafter nor Invictus is superb, but if they continue collaborating something one day will be.  A bit of droll humor runs in the necessary subplot of Marie LeLay's (Cecile de France) proposed book about the foibles of Francois Mitterrand, which turns into something else entirely, much to the chagrin of her planned publisher.      Hereafter is not A Perfect World, The Unforgiven, Mystic River or even Gran Torino.  In other words, it is not Eastwood at his finest.  Nonetheless, it is, as most everything he does, well worth whatever you spend to watch it.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|Believe it or not I just discovered John Mayer.  I bought Continuum last week and I actually love this CD.  Every song speaks to me.  The CD is a mixture of optimism and heartbreak.  'Slow Dancing in a Crowded Room' is the song that makes my eyes water. And 'Gravity' is so me.  On a blog a commenter wrote that she swears John peeps into her journal for new material.  I feel the same way.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|I loved it! In fact, I saw it twice. I think the 3D version was awesome but I did view both. Favorite part was the dog dish and newspaper..don't want to give too much away!
B002ZG99TK|3.0|Washington is as always engaging to watch. He has the wonderful self-effacing manner (which is definitely part of his huge appeal) that allows him to become the role he's portraying. But the movie was all too predictable:    a) Why do these movies always have to have some annoying 'troubled family life' subplot playing in the background? And it's always the working stiff, lower/middle class young couple in the midst of a seperation. The woman, with a child of course, always has that semi-stressed out look about her.  Of course at the end of the movie they all reunite happily ever after.  b) The obligatory heliocopter chase scenes. What were all those TV news choppers flying around the runaway train?  You mean the police could not keep them away? There they were complicating all the rescue efforts and no one tried stopping them?   c) Washington, playing a guy in his advanced middle age, is able to hop effortlessly across the tops of speeding railroad cars like a cat?    d) And of course lets never leave out the villains as paunchy, golf-playing, heartless white guys. Heaven forbid that they should be portrayed as capable and caring. That would be politically incorrect. And the guy who loses the train in the first place? An overweight white guy of course. And the guy (Ned) who helps rescue the train at the end? He's a loud-mouthed, grandstander.   Because we have to reserve the heros for the minority roles...  e) Washington and Rosario Dawson.      See what I mean?  Predictable.
0307266303|5.0|I am 49 years old and until about 2 years ago I was entering the occassional triathelon, but a series of running injuries has plagued me ever since. This sequence of injuries parallelled the writer of B2R. The good news is the book provides a very goog and entertaining narrative that shows the reason so many people have injuries from running is their running style, and the book provides an interesting insight into a tribe in Mexico who are probably the best nature born runners on earth. We can all learn from this...
B003VB5E2E|3.0|Bought this blu-ray a few weeks ago expecting something great. Nope. Doesn't work for me. Very boring selection of songs by many great musicians. A major disappointment. Song after song. Just not there. Best I can recommend is the country set with Vince Gill.  Now, I don't like country, but this had my foot tapping. The rest, well, what can I say?  Already said it. Other comments - the sound was not great either. DTS, really? Could not get that great surround sound dynamic, at least out of my system. Same goes for the video blu-ray. Nothing spectular, which is what I expect. Now, this is not bad.  But not worth recommending. Frankly, I think other reviews here are way over the top.  More influenced by the musicians than the songs. I've seen lots of great blues and rock guitar concerts. This ain't it. Not even close.
B00275EHJG|4.0|Enjoyed watching our old \\"toy story\\" friends come back to life with my kids. We laughed out loud. It had a heartfelt story to it. I highly recommend it.
B001AQO3XS|5.0|This Blu Ray is a reissue of the remastered Highlander released a few years ago on standard DVD. The value here is getting the movie in full 1080 Hi Def and the sound reproduced in DTS Master Sound.  The movie looks and sounds just right for a lower budget production of the 1980s.  If only the evil Kurgan had survived to be in the sequels, I would have been interested in them as well.
B001GCUO52|4.0|we like this movie because it shows more gore, even though how fake it is, it's still a good movie, it comes with a pair of the red and blue 3D glasses but they suck, it's better to watch this in REAL 3D, but it's really clear in Blu Ray.

I'm an old rocker, but how is it that Buddy Guy can keep coming out with new material and the old rockers have to make \\"comeback\\" tours and endlessly recycle their old \\"hits\\"?    Well worth the money.  Listening to this one makes me want to jump on the web and track down concert venues.

B000TFINY6|5.0|The Blu Ray version of Lost is amazingly sharp and really allows the viewer to see the fine details of the filming of the show. The shots of the island scenes are beautiful and lush and you kinda feel like you are looking through a window. It's really cool to see things in such detail that you would have really never had seen when the show originally broadcast on network TV.     The bonus features sometimes really go into depth and give you a perspective of how the show was made and it is quite interesting to see the bloopers, the deleted scenes, and interviews from Cast and Crew. There are hours of bonus features that really add to the set.    This show was probably the most detailed show in TV history as far as I am concerned. The amount of back story to make this show come together is mind boggling, and how the writers tied everything up together is truly a feat. You can tell how anyone who worked on this show from producers, cast, and crew took so much pride in making this a great show from beginning to end.    This set is worth every penny if you love Lost as much as I do, and it will offer hours of entertainment for years to come. A great present for the lost fan in your family. And being in Blu-Ray just takes it to another level.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|Legend of the seeker series is based on the books called \\"The sword of truth\\" by Terry Goodkind and while it may look that you need to be a fan to enjoy it, it is not so because the first season was fullfiling in every way with magic,suprises and supense.    Can you handle the Sword of Truth? if you can go ahead and enjoy \\"Legend of the Seeker\\".
B001FB5634|4.0|This movie is very impressive from a cinematic standpoint but you really have to be committed in body and soul in order to watch it.  Its probably the Post Apocalyptic film that paints the most realistic picture of what it would be like to live in those times very intense.  Don't look for car chases like in Mad Max.  Don't look for Kurt Russel to surf his way to freedom like in Escape from LA  or even an ultimate moral message like the Book of Eli.      This is a film that sets out to tell the story of a father and his son trying to survive in a changed world.  Where happiness is measured by the fact that one was able to find a root cellar stocked with canned food or find a Coca-Cola in the bowels of a looted vending machine.   If \\"The Road\\" were instead not an end of the world film but instead a WW2 film everything else that has come before it would be Kelly's Heroes fun but designed to entertain.  The Road would be Schindler's List.      Overall-About as realistic as one can get but for this kind of film that means terror for lunch and despair for dinner for as much as you can like it the first time you watch if you resolve to watch it there is no one to cheer for with the grim knowledge that man and boy may have escaped the cannibals this time but there are plenty more twenty miles down The Road.  This is the type of movie that may win awards but I find them to intense to sit through a second or third time.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|The cable works perfectly and costs half as much as similar cables I found in stores. Couldn't be happier. The stress free packaging was great!
B003Y58CKS|5.0|If you're considering buying a dvd of Rigoletto, this is the one to buy!<br />Why?: The music, the singing, the acting, and the staging and costumes.<br /><br />First of all, there are the beautiful melodies of Verdi, performed in full rich sound by the Dresden Stattskapelle (officially called the Sachsische Staatskapelle Dresden), very ably conducted by Fabio Luisi.<br /><br />The performers are brilliant, not only in their singing, but their acting as well. Many will delight in the demonic, crazed look of Zeljko Lucic as Rigoletto, as he confronts the Duke's courtiers who abducted his daughter, Gilda. Lucic has a huge voice matching his acting and dominance of the other characters on stage.<br /><br />Yes, Diana Damrau, as Gilda, sings all the high notes (and of course, all the other notes) perfectly and with acting and reactions to other actors that make this a dramatic and moving performance. Juan Diego Florez is an excellent match for Gilda both in flawless singing and acting that inspires infatuation for and disgust at the Duke of Mantua.<br /><br />It should be mentioned that the staging and costumes also contribute much to the beauty of this production. In the opening scene with the Duke and his court, his courtiers and ladies are dressed with masks and costumes resembling birds, lizards, and insects. There is some frontal nudity, but don't let this and the costumes put you off. It helps get across the depravity and the debauchery of the sex-crazed Duke of Mantua and his court, which inspires Rigoletto in his quest for vengeance.<br /><br />This is the best Rigoletto in decades, if not the best one ever!
B003DZX44I|2.0|I just watched the new blu ray of B&B and something was just WRONG.I was a child when I saw this for the first time in theatres.I watched this on vhs almost every weekend growing up.Im now a preschool teacher.My 2 yr olds always ask to watch \\"Beast\\" on movie day so we roll out the vcr cart.So of course I was extremely excited abouut a re release but the animation is just OFF.The colors are definitely not right.I dont know the technical name for the change but it seemed like some scenes were from the original while others were animated cheaply and cartoonish.I think Ill just buy a dvd alone version.Anyway who is familiar with this movie would notice the artwork is different in a bad way.
0553384775|2.0|A year ago I was visiting NYC with some friends and I picked this book up in a Barnes&Noble store from a large pile of books. I found this book quite disappointing. Belfort calls himself the Wolf of Wall Street, even though he nor his firm have anything to do with Wall Street. Too summarize it very shortly: there a bunch of crooks. This book doesn't go into too much detail on their specific crimes (except on how they transfer the money to Geneva), but most people reading this book will see how these guys are operating on their customers.<br /><br />This all isn't really that boring, but this author also tries to impress you with his decadent lifestyle. You'll find all the details on how he cheats his wive with numerous hookers, the amounts of drugs (\\"qualuudes\\") and alcohol he consumes and the  millions of dollars he wastes. This is not impressing at all! If anything, it's quite pathetic. As a 25-year-old trader I'm not impressed at all with that.<br /><br />I also don't understand why this author needed so much pages to write this book. It should have been 1/3 of the current number of pages.
B002NFCHBA|4.0|Good value for money.<br />Excellent variety of musicians.<br />Chamber music by M.Rostropovich and M.Argerich is magic.<br />Songs by Elzbieta Szmytka is very beautiful.<br />But! Waltz Op70-2 F minor by V.Ashkenazy finishes a half way through.<br />I haven't listened to the whole set yet ( as there are 17 CDs)and<br />I hope there's no more incomplete recordings.

B003EYVY04|5.0|Before the release of the first two movies in the Ultimate Edition, I saw an extended version of both on ABC's Family Channel. There were multiple scenes not seen in the original theatrical version, but the versions I saw were identical to what was on the Ultimate Editions of both movies..    As of the writing of this review, I am watching an extended version of Prisoner of Azkaban on ABC's Family Channel. It will be followed by Goblet of Fire in less than two hours and I assume that will be extended as well. I've counted three new scenes already in Prisoner of Azkaban.    I expect the new Ultimate Editions will be extended even though that has not been advertised as of yet.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|Though I wanted to see this film when it came out theatrically in the spring of 2009, I expected very little from it.  It was just the concept that seemed cool - vikings and monsters and aliens, awesome!  But the movie came and went - I saw posters and a trailer for it, but I'm not sure if it played where I live at all, if it did it was only here for a week.  And it got generally poor reviews; I know a lot of people here aren't fans of professional reviewers, but I've followed film criticism for a long time - since well before the rise of amateur critics here on Amazon and other places - and I'm fairly critical myself, especially when it comes to contemporary action movies.  I love action as much as the next guy, but to me it's been going downhill pretty steadily as the budgets have gone sky-high and CGI has taken over for pure brawny manly fighting and gunplay.  So I really didn't figure this would be much of anything by the time I got around to it last night.<br /><br />Well, what a pleasant surprise!  No, it's no CITIZEN KANE or anything, heck it isn't even DIE HARD and I'm not sure it's a patch on the old Kirk Douglas THE VIKINGS or some of the better 50s monster movies - but it's a heckuva lot of fun, it's got no obvious huge flaws, and most importantly it doesn't insult the audience's intelligence.  It's a good sign to me when, right away, the film bothers to explain (but not in overbearing detail) how it's hero Kainan (James Cavaziel) is human despite crashing in a spaceship in 700s Scandinavia, and how he can learn the native language (Old Norse).  I like how he's held when captured as a likely enemy, as he should be - but the king, Rothgar (John Hurt) is wise enough to listen to him and quick to free him when he's shown his usefulness in killing a huge bear that threatened the king and several men.  At this point Kainan essentially becomes a Viking - but it's clear that he's got his own purpose, because there's a monster much tougher than any bear on the loose, a \\"dragon\\" called a Morwen, that followed him from another world.<br /><br />The story is basic, and reasonably predictable - we've got a rival, would-be king Wulfric (the too-handsome Jack Huston), a potential love interest and Wulfric's intended, Freya (Sophia Myles), and rival chief Gunnar (Ron Perlman) who blames Rothgar for his village's destruction.  How all the alliances and relationships shake out isn't going to surprise anyone, but it all feels pretty natural - the developing feelings between Freya and Kainan don't ever come off as either forced or cute, and Wulfric's rivalry isn't there just to have a big climactic duel that's going to jeopardize the ultimate mission - destroying the Morwen.  And Kainan's eventual choice is left up right until the end, and seems like it could go either way.  I did think that the flashback sequences detailing the origin of the Morwen and Kainan's people were unnecessary, and getting into the morality of the destruction of the dragonlike creatures probably was unneeded also; we never get to know them as anything but highly destructive and bloodthirsty animals, so I'm not sure what purpose is served in showing Kainan feel guilty about his hand in their annihilation.  These bits and a few others do help push the film to near two hours, not really that long by today's action movie standards, but a bit more than it needs to be, as otherwise it's a pretty lean and fast-moving piece of work.<br /><br />The cast is all fine; Perlman of course dominates in his unfortunately-few scenes, and Cavaziel acquits himself well - a bit stoic and dull, but that's not a bad thing in this kind of film.  The CGI monster looks OK, and I like that we only see it bit by bit until the second half of the film - I think director/cowriter Howard McCain learned some things about monster movies from older masters like Roger Corman.  A nice-looking Viking village, and great scenery throughout (Nova Scotia stands in for Norway here).  Some of the action sequences are a bit too dark and frenetic for my taste - a bit too much of the modern fast-cutting style where it's hard to know what's going on - but this isn't as overdone as it is in a lot of films, and there's a good understanding of building suspense and putting a longer action sequence together, particularly at the climax.  Overall this is one of the better action/monster films to come along since the first two ALIEN films, and it's sad that it got so little exposure initially.  Well, let's hope it builds an audience.oo dark and frenetic for my taste - a bit too much of the modern fast-cutting style where it's hard to know what's going on - but this isn't as overdone as it is in a lot of films, and there's a good understanding of building suspense and putting a longer action sequence together, particularly at the climax.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|Not having HBO, I finally got the chance to see season one--and what a treat!  These have been re-watched several times already, and I am waiting not-so-patiently for season 3 to arrive once it's released.  Love me a good Vampire story!  :)
0375842209|5.0|I absolutely loved this novel!  With its unique narrator, the story was able to cover so much more than a normal novel. Its characters are so realistic, their emotions surreal. It keeps you hooked the whole way through, despite its incredible sense of foreboding. It is haunting, and a true masterpiece, to really see in depth the pain and moments of happiness occuring in Nazi Germany during world war one. This story will stay with me forever! :)

0385737955|5.0|The Maze Runner was a very interesting book. The way the setting was introduced and explained was very detailed. The way the characters were introduced allowed to feel the way they felt and see what they saw. The book focuses on Thomas' view, the fear and the bravery. The plot was also very neat, with no sudden events that did not fit in. The book is very fast paced, and adventure is filled to the brim in every chapter. The end left me wanting for more. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes suspense and action, in a dystopia setting. I will also be buying and reading the the second book, The Scorch Trials.
0761158464|2.0|[[ASIN:0761158464 Star Wars: A Scanimation Book: Iconic Scenes from a Galaxy Far, Far Away...]]    This was bought for my 7 year old grandson.  I purchased it because I had also bought this author's other 3 scanimation books, Waddle, Gallop and Swing for his 3 year old brother.  The first 3 books were excellent and very unique. My grandson's older brother even got a kick out of looking at them. These books are made so that when you turn the page and move it back and forth the pictures actually move. These books should be considered board books since the pages are thick and cannot be bent or creased. Based on the above I decided to purchase the Star Wars Scanimation book by the same author.  I was somewhat disappointed when it arrived.  First of all the pictures are not that clear and most of them look like moving blobs.  There is no story but instead the book contains quotes from the different Star Wars movies.  If a child has not seen the movies the quotes mean nothing and the moving blobs mean even less.  I would highly recommend buying this authors first 3 scanimation books that I listed above.  This one cannot be compared to the others when it comes to quality.  Very big disappointment.
B003TWONOK|2.0|This wasn't a book is was an imitation of one and a bad imitation at that.    Like many reviewers I've read a whole lot of NR books, own many of them and re-read them often.  This one won't be making it to my collection.  There was far far far too much detail on how to train a dog and next to nothing on the creating of the dynamic between the leads and the building of suspense for our murderer.    The storyline was also a repeat of Angels Fall.  We have our damaged survivor heroine, our brash, moody, loner creative type hero and a heroine with a fixation in one area - cooking in AF, dog training in TS.  Only problem is that Angels Fall is the far better book.  The ending in AF is also more realistic and in tune with the characters than the unimpressive attempt in The Search.      Given the usual high standard of NR's writing I wonder if she didn't outsource this to a secretary with some basic \\"change this\\" type instructions.    If you want some dog training advice and don't mind a story that could be better along for the ride - read the book (but do what I did and borrow from the library).  If you want an enjoyable NR read that you're going to want to re-read as soon as you finish - try another title.

There are no great life moment revelations, nothing particulary especial aboout Julia Robert's character.  No further exploration to all the other characters.

B002COTI64|5.0|It is rare these days to find an artist who can make a great album.  Most manage to produce one or two good songs then fill the rest of the album with crap.  Regina Spektor is one of those rare artists who can produce a real album where every song is a wonderful song.  There are absolutely no filler songs.  \\"Far\\" is one of the few albums that I listen to in its entirety.  Regina's voice is truly an instrument that she has fine-tuned and plays well.  She is also a very accomplished pianist, not just someone who can pound out some catchy notes and a few chords.  Her music is refreshing and unique, not top 40s candy-wrapper junk food.  Her lyrics are deep, spiritual and poetic.  She's the Bob Dylan of our generation - except she has a good voice.
B001UV4XFQ|2.0|Update #2: Went to Target and purchased their version. That too is FLIPPER DISC!*argh*<br />All the Blu rays are flipper disc EXCEPT the movie only blu ray disc that has none of the special features. *sigh*<br />On the plus side there are no black pixel dots ruining the picture. The disc quality is better than the summit version I first purchased.<br /><br />This review is about the DVD options to purchase. It is NOT about the movie which I thought was SPECTACULAR. Every year we do this song and dance with Summit all because of these \\"exclusive\\" contracts they have with different retailers. I wanted the blu- ray dvd plus a seperate dvd for roadtrips INCLUDING the special features.<br />Summit released NO SUCH VERSION!<br />Option A: Blu ray only (NO special features)<br />Option B: Blu ray + DVD combo single FLIPPER DISK! Can Summit get any cheaper?!<br /><br /> Only individual retailers could meet my needs.... @ a sky high premium price! The Twilight series is the ONLY series customers have to jump through so many hoops for. Other studios will offer the blu ray + reg. dvd AND a DIGITAL COPY for the SAME PRICE that Summit has set for their merchandise! Summit can suck it!<br /><br />WHY FLIPPERS SUCK:<br />Most of the problem with flippers comes from inconsistent manufacturing quality (and format quality). The discs that are used for blu rays have higher formating standard than that of a regular dvd. A dual disc ( blu ray one side/ dvd on the other) currently, does NOT confirm to the standards set for the blu ray format. Blu rays have higher storage capacity and better scratch resistance. If this disc format is NOT used to make the blu ray then you LOSE quality AND durability.<br /><br />The stand alone blu ray dvd is the only true Blu ray in correct format... too bad u have to sacrifice the bonus footage (as currently package by Summit) in order to get it!<br /><br />Update: I just watched the movie and unfortunately the Blu ray quality sucks.<br />Wish I had purchased the stand alone Blu ray disc and sacrificed the extras. *sad face*<br /><br />Update #2: Went to Target and purchased their version.

My psp slim now has 32GB of memory and it couldn't be better.  I can't find a reason to let go of my psp and get an Ipod or Iphone or anything like that because my psp does everything I could want it to do.  I'll admit, it could use a better faster web browser, and who knows maybe 3G phone calls in the future, but I have a cell phone for all that, and when deployed, psp's skype makes calling home a snap and cheaper than any phone plan, so for ultimate portable entertainment that fits in your pocket grab this and an extended battery for your psp slim and you are good to go.<br />-Sgt of Marines

1575666286|5.0|So i learned about this book after watching the Gerson Miracle\\"  I don't have a disease but when I got married I gained well over 40lbs and my back started hurting, my work-outs became fewer and less intense, and my new office job turned me into a slug.  I was sick of torn and tight muscles.  I didn't have money for a good juicer when I first was exposed to the information I just decided to eat healthier, and very heavy on green vegetables (organic mostly when I had the extra cash) and then bought certain foods to help me get on my way, ready to prepare for the juicing.  I stopped eating fast food altogether and NO SODA, NO ICE CREAM.  I still drink full beers and the occasional bottle of wine.  I have lost weight VERY slowly because I am not exercising, but my energy level must have tripled, without one exaggeration. Finally, i decided to buy a juicer and this book.  We will see what comes from this balancing my body.  I hope this book works for everyone!!
B00005OCMR|1.0|I never saw the original Tron, so you'd think Disney would capitalize on this opportunity to reissue the DVD so people like me, and fans in anticipation of the new release would be able to see it (and any special behind the scenes extras) and actually remember what it was about (and get any references to it in the new film when they see it.).  BUT NO...  I guess I (and my dd) won't be seeing the film until (maybe) when IT is released on DVD (that is if the original is ever released on DVD, and I then bother to watch it without the incentive of then seeing the sequel on the big screen).  Just like Icabod Crane (Mr.Toad) was never released on VHS/DVD until AFTER the Mr. Toad's wild ride was replace with Winnie the Pooh at Walt Disney World.  And I was really looking forward to seeing this film...after watching the original.  I HAD to rate it a one, since Disney has chosen to not let let me watch it.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I almost passed on watching this movie as I've never been all that interested in the Robin Hood story, which has become more or less of a parody.  I've never thought of this story as historical or epic, this is probably due to how it's been portrayed by Hollywood.<br /><br />I decided to give this a chance because of Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott.  The two of them have been involved in more movies that I've found to me outstanding than I can think of right now.<br /><br />From the start I was drawn into the story, and struck by the historical and political aspects of this film.  All the care and little details that went into making this film really made the viewer connect with it, in its historical context.<br /><br />I had no idea what the Robin Hood story was really all about, but have a greater sense of that now, and have been reading up on 12th century English history as a result.<br /><br />It's about time a film like this was made about Robin Hood, and the real story presented.<br /><br />Well done!
1439107955|3.0|I purchased this book hoping that it would include a comprehensive overview of the modern physiological understanding of cancer, but I was fairly disappointed.  I did enjoy reading the book, and it was well written and engaging.  I learned quite a bit about many of the key discoveries involved as well as a history of the treatment of cancer.  However, the book left out so much about modern cancer physiology.  An example of these omissions is the tumor suppressing gene p53: a gene that is the subject of tens of thousands of academic papers and represents billions of dollars of cancer research.  The only mention of this gene is in a list of tumor suppressor genes.  It is sometimes speculated that the amount of accumulated knowledge about cancer doubles every few years.  This book almost completely neglected research from the past 10 years with the exception of the tail ends of a few clinical trials.  This book could have been published 10 years ago and had almost identical content.      The book only covers topics that with a direct implication to accepted treatments.  This is clearly a result of Mukherjee being a clinical researcher.  The book would have been much different if written by a basic science researcher.  The book gives minimal and anecdotal insight into future treatments resulting from current research.  As to be expected with a general audience book, there is a lack of technical language and explanations.  The cellular processes are described at a level comparable to a high school biology class.  If you are interested in a meaningful understanding of cancer this is not the book for you.  Another annoyance about this book is the clear attempt by the author to not use evolution terminology. Just as the author describes cancer as a genetic disease, cancer is equally an evolutionary disease.  Ranging from the progression of the disease to all implication of underlying genetics, cancer is full of evolutionary processes.  For a scientist to intentionally ignore this in order to reach an audience that is uncomfortable with anything related to evolution is dishonest.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Ill make this short and sweet.<br /><br />Nolan originally started on this movie in 2001 and decided to wait on making it.<br />He went on to make Batman Begins, The Prestige, and The Dark Knight (all good movies).<br />After working on Inception some more he began working with Warner Bros. I think that it<br />was well worth the 9-10 year wait to see this movie when technology was better suited for it.<br />Nolan used the least amount of visual effects as he could trying to do as much in camera as<br />possible and did very well with it.<br /><br />Inception is about dreams and dream-stealers. It has dreams within dreams and that effects time<br />within time. The concept is deep and brilliant yet not too hard to grasp. Nolan's imagination is<br />well laid out and easy to enjoy. The pinnacle of this movie, in my opinion, is that it took a<br />concept of dreams and made me loose track of time. Let yourself fall into the movie and you will<br />come out feeling like time has stopped and you will enjoy the experience like no other.<br />There has never been a movie that has sucked me in as much as this one and pulled me into its story.<br />There are a lot of fantastic movies out there but I have to say this one is deserving of many awards<br />for actors/actresses and definitely best-picture.<br /><br />If the mind of Christopher Nolan's dream-stealing falls short of stealing more than one award i will be shocked.
B002Q0F6V0|5.0|I have been an AIC fan for over 15 years and I can honestly say this is not only the best original album they have ever cut but maybe the best original album in a generation or so that ANYBODY has cut. It is obvious Jerry Cantrell spent years putting together the music for this piece and it shows. As a former musician I am amazed at the quality of the harmony that he and the new singer Duvall are able to accomplish; I never believed Layne Staley could be matched, but I believe this guy did it. I had about given up on rock as a genre until this album; thank you Jerry and the rest of Alice in Chains. RIP Layne Staley.

B0049D1TCM|3.0|I was very optimistic for the release of Nicki Minaj's Album Pink Friday, based on previous tracks with other artists.  In my opinion, the album sounded very pop vice what she's been known to do.  The people who produced this album stayed very safe in the way the approached its production, and you will hear it in the music.  It was like she was being held back from being herself, or she just entered the \\"Jadakiss\\" category of being only good on other peoples songs.  The songs with Eminem, Will.I.am, and Rihanna's are pretty good, but the rest I cannot remember or found interesting.<br /><br />Three good things about the album: Nice pictures in the album case, creative lyrics, and good collaborations.<br /><br />Three bad things about the album: Over produced, not enough hard hitting songs, and kind of boring.<br /><br />I just was not feeling the album like I thought I would.  I think she needs new producers or I need younger ears.  I was more excited about the anticipation of getting the album than I am to listen to it again in the future.

B003U0AHBO|5.0|I like the first and most popular review by the scholar.  Here I will provide a snap-shot of my own and a couple of quotations from a rather good wikipedia review of Thoreau.<br /><br />The film was longer, better, and had more stars than I expected, including William Hurt.  Triteness was avoided.  Above all, this movie is righteous and timely as we contemplate the present situation.<br /><br />From Wikipedia on Thoreau:<br /><br />The government, according to Thoreau, is not just a little corrupt or unjust in the course of doing its otherwise-important work, but in fact the government is primarily an agent of corruption and injustice. Because of this, it is \\"not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize.\\"<br /><br />Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.... where the State places those who are not with her, but against her,- the only house in a slave State in which a free man can abide with honor.... Cast your whole vote, not a strip of paper merely, but your whole influence.<br /><br />The movie ends where I expected to begin.  And now America begins anew, with a convergence of forces in 2012, where I had hoped it might end with peace and prosperity for all.  The fight has only now begun as the public has awakened to the injustices done at our expense and in our name.<br /><br />RIGHTEOUS.<br /><br />Here are two lists of lists of summary reviews of non-fiction work that bears on the current and future nature of the world.

B000NU2CY4|5.0|I am pleased to report that the version I received, ordered on the 1st of December, was the remastered version. While the original release has seen a lot of highly vocal backlash, the remastered version couldn't look any better. Simply put, it is reference quality, pushing the detail envelope enabled by the blu-ray resolution to its limits, and showing the film as it was truly intended by the filmmakers. Pristine, with bold colors and exemplary contrast, this is how a blu-ray master should be. Paramount sacrificed some marginally bad PR (the importance of a small percentage of home theater enthusiasts is disputable in the grand scheme of things) in exchange for not having to recall their previous version, and seemingly going out of their way to mask the differences on the outside packaging to make distinguishing the two more difficult. It's getting almost to the point now that you might be better off simply putting the disc in your player and looking at the image yourself to see which version it is. You can be sure that if you receive the newer version, which will only become more probable as time goes on, that it will not be representative of all the bad ratings it has garnered here on Amazon. Contrarily, it will be an indispensable addition to any discerning blu-ray collector, and one worthy of showcasing your home theater system with. Highly recommended to those willing to take the (quickly dwindling) risk.

It is WELL thought out and creatively presented.    I can't express how glad I am that I stumbled upon it (searching for books on 'composition').  I would go so far as to refer to it as a prerequisite for successful practicing and master-level musicianship.      In fact, it goes beyond success in musicianship.  It is a life lesson in dispensing with one's ego and expectations ... and enjoying the fruits that result from that freedom.

0525423273|5.0|`Anna and the French Kiss' is the debut YA novel from Stephanie Perkins.<br /><br />Anna's senior year is not going as planned. Instead of living it up in her home town of Atlanta, Georgia and crushing on her cinemaplex fantasy boyfriend, Anna is being shipped to a French boarding school. Really, it's like something out of a Charlotte Bronte novel. Anna's father has hit the big-time with his schmaltzy romance-depression novels, and he insists on giving Anna some cultural learning. So Anna is going to the School of America in Paris. Paris - where the French are renowned for hating Americans, white sneakers and fast food. What is a little Georgia-peach like Anna supposed to do?<br /><br />Anna's homesickness is eased when she is befriended by the football-loving Meredith - who then introduces her to Josh and Rashmi. . . and &Eacute;tienne St. Clair. &Eacute;tienne is the boarding school's resident heartthrob - every girl wants to date him, and every boy wants to hate him. And it doesn't take long until Anna joins the St. Clair fanclub. But he has a girlfriend. Plus he's British - well, British/American/French. . . still, far too refined for little ol' Anna. But what does it mean when St. Clair starts spending all his free time with Anna. What does it mean when she starts calling him &Eacute;tienne and a drunken revelation could change everything. . .?<br /><br />I started reading this book at 8PM one night, and found myself inhaling the last page at midnight. I literally could not pry the book from my hands, it was so darn good! And it's definitely going on my 2010 favourite's list!<br /><br />Perkin's debut is very much a contemporary teen romance, with all the trimmings. It's boy meets girl, except with a Paris setting and heightened teen melodrama when homesickness and distance factor into the emotional equation.<br /><br />Anna is a fantastic protagonist. I loved the fact that she was a shy, clean-freak (mostly because I could relate!). Anna gets to Paris and can only think about how homesick she is, and self-conscious at being a `crass' American. I think she had a very relatable and understandable reaction to her boarding school experience. Of course Perkins could have gone to the other end of the spectrum and written about Anna cutting loose and going crazy on her freedom (and the French drinking age of 16!). But I really related to Anna's shyness, and it was interesting to read her intimidation of Paris. Anna has a really big hang-up at not being able to speak the language, and this made for interesting reading and insight into the life of an international student. Little things become big anxieties - like going to the cinema and asking for movie ticket! I loved the `Lost in Translation' examination. It also made for some pretty hilarious moments in the novel.<br /><br />And then there's &Eacute;tienne St. Clair. . . *dreamy sigh*. Ahhh. . . never has there been a more swoon-worthy fictional teen pin-up. &Eacute;tienne is the whole package - he has the accent (British!) he's got a crooked smile, effortlessly mussed hair, a killer sense of humour and a romantic-steak a mile wide. I loved him! I especially loved that his complications weren't always easy to decipher. . . it's up to Anna (and readers) to interpret his actions, from drunken ramblings to `is he touching Anna's leg on purpose in the darkened movie theatre'? I loved the melodrama and emotional roller-coaster that &Eacute;tienne and Anna go on - because I was invested in these two from the get-go.<br /><br />One thing I really loved about this book was the examination of family. It's not an all-consuming focus of the novel, but Perkins at least touches on familial issues. So often in contemporary YA books parents are convenient no-shows, swept under the rug for storyline's sake without a believable reason for their absence. That's not the case in `Anna and the French Kiss', though it easily could have been. Shipping her protagonist off to a boarding school couldhave given Perkins a legitimate excuse to skip over discussions of family. . . but instead she writes about these teenagers feelings of abandonment and displacement that comes with their family sending them away. It's a big deal for &Eacute;tienne especially, who has never been close to his father. And for Anna, whose father changed when he gained success. . . and I've got to say, Anna's father (hilariously!) reminded me of a certain American pulp-writer of schmaltzy love stories. . . *cough* Nicholas Sparks! *cough*.<br /><br />There are two more books planned as companions to Anna's novel. `Lola and the Boy Next Door' is set for a Fall 2011 release, while `Isla and the Happily Ever After' is slated for Fall 2012. Isla has a cameo appearance in `Anna and the French Kiss', but I'm not so sure I know who Lola is. . . regardless, I did think at the end of `Anna and the French Kiss' that the story could go on (and I would like little glimpses into Anna and &Eacute;tienne's ongoing romance! *squee!*). So I was thrilled to learn of these `companion' sequels!<br /><br />`Anna and the French Kiss' is the literary equivalent of a chocolate &eacute;clair.

B0043VCPW8|5.0|Saw him on this tour... I wasn't expecting much but I thought it was one of the best concerts I've been to.  He sounds as good as ever.  Rarely do I like the live versions better than the studio versions, but I thought a lot of these songs sounded better stripped down, especially the newer songs.  I think he should record more songs just like he played them on this tour.      When he played \\"Please Forgive Me\\" at the show I was at, and also the Ft Pierce, FL show he goes \\"This would make a good country song\\"  in the middle and starts singing it in this country sounding voice.   On this release they cut out the part where he says \\"This would make a good country song\\" and it just goes into him singing in that country style and it comes across kinda awkward.   Not sure why they cut that out..... or at least I assume they cut it out.    They need to release this show on DVD/Blu Ray!!!!!!!!!!!!    Buy the CD in the mean time... well worth it.  Spend your money on the regular release rather than the \\"deluxe version\\" though, since it includes the same amout of songs.
B00000I2PG|5.0|Hands down, the best pop album ever!<br />  Bass lines? Catchiest you will ever hear.  Listen to this when driving, and you may dance your way to an accident. So beware.<br />  Lyrics?  Ridiculously clever, smart, at times hilariously cheesy, but always perfect.  Too many great ones to quote but some of my favorites: \\"I stuck your marriage proposal, in the waste disposal\\", \\"If I got dancing lessons for all the lips I should have kissed, I'd be a millionaire, I'd be Fred Astaire\\", \\"Like the world spinning round on its axis, I know democracy but I know what's fascist\\".  Stories of heartache and unrequited love told with wit and savvy.<br />  Martin Frye's singing? Great- especially when he hits those ridiculously high notes that in a way, sound like he's just showing off, but are done with so much flair and style that at times, yes, they do send chills and/or giggles down your spine.<br />  9 of the most perfect pop songs you will ever hear.  Danceable, singable, even the ballads are constructed with an eye towards drama, peaking with enough flash to make them upbeat.<br />  Simply put, this album is THE TEMPLATE for smart, catchy, infectious, fun pop!

B003VS0CXS|5.0|This is a Super Panavision movie of the late 1960's. Its former VHS incarnation produced a completely washed out full frame picture, concurrently with a highly distorted soundtrack. It got significantly better in the DVD edition (sound issues were all gone), but in the new Blu-Ray version the image is beyond reprehension, and the sound benefited from a new lossless audio track.    Although it was not evident, it seems that CCBB was subjected to the full Lowry Digital treatment, which normally produces a state-of-the-art 4K resolution, with a consistent colour throughout the movie. It is the dream of the movie collector and it will surely be of interest to the occasional or to the film fan. Highly recommended!
B00335EQ3Q|4.0|Before he started making movies with Hollywood names and geting known for the breakneck editing techniques of Moulin Rouge, Australian director/co-screenwriter Baz Luhrmann gained international acclaim and a shelf of awards for Strictly Ballroom, a quirky, highly stylized light drama about a young dancer who apparently isn't allowed to improvise and the young plain Jane who becomes his partner.<br /><br />Filmed with a marvelous Aussie cast, Luhrmann made up for a clearly limited budget with flashy lighting, dynamic color and a an eclectic mix of musical styles. Though referred to as musical, there is no on-camera singing and the songs are used as dance background for the most part. Doris Day's hit, \\"Perhaps\\" is referred to by Luhrmann as a \\"pricey\\" acquistion for the film but very much worth it.<br /><br />Disney fans will want to listen for \\"Os quindines de ya ya\\" which serves as the key music for the father's dancing past. \\"Ya ya\\" was the big number in Walt Disney's The Three Caballeros in which the produce lady danced with Donald Duck, the townspeople and an animated dancing city. Another song, \\"No Other Love,\\" was a '50s pop tune adapted from Chopin which was a hit for Jo Stafford and was one of the handful of Disney songs that were not created for movies but just as pop hits, like \\"Shrimp Boats\\" and \\"Mule Train.\\"<br /><br />I never could quite cotton to the whiplash pace of Moulin Rouge, so even though Strictly Ballroom sometimes has a Howard Hawks rate of speed, it's not all in the editing but rather in the performances, which are uniformly excellent. The opening scenes were so raucously done that they reminded me, of all things, of an episode of The Monkees.<br /><br />Parents should take note that, although this film has a PG rating and is not as gritty as it might have been, there is some strong language and one scene in which a dance judge and and a young woman are seen in bed, vigorously engaged what my dad used to call \\"spoo-ja-doo.\\"<br /><br />This special edition DVD includes an audio commentary from 2002 with Luhrmann, Choreographer John \\"Cha Cha\\" O'Connell and Production Designer Catherine Martin and a new half-hour chronicle of the story behind the film, which was a Cinderella story in itself, from a student musical to a plucky little film with a first-time director and star to a dubious opening with a negative review, all the way to a Cannes Film Festival award win. This film was quite a change of pace in its day, many years before the dawn of popular TV dance competition shows like Dancing with the Stars and So You Think You Can Dance.<br /><br />Have to add, though, that the first time Antonio Vargas and Paul Mercurio begin the pivotal paso doble dance, it can't help now but conjure up an image of Buzz Lightyear's Spanish mode in Toy Story 3.ntary from 2002 with Luhrmann, Choreographer John \\"Cha Cha\\" O'Connell and Production Designer Catherine Martin and a new half-hour chronicle of the story behind the film, which was a Cinderella story in itself, from a student musical to a plucky little film with a first-time director and star to a dubious opening with a negative review, all the way to a Cannes Film Festival award win.

1439156816|5.0|I bought this for my voracious-reader daughter (37 years old) who's expressed an interest in writing...We all have a novel milling around in our heads, right.... Well, I just glanced at the first few pages and suddenly I was halfway through the book. King offers his unique perspective on creating and developing a story line and puts his own spin on what works and what doesn't work in the process of developing and writing characters and keeping readers attention. Definitely a good read!
B003INJETO|5.0|First of all let me make it clear that I don't listen to metal at all and that is why I don't share the frustration of many disappointed fans of that genre. However, I listen to many different calmer styles of music and I have gone through a lot of new albums lately. It seems like many people highly recommending new progressive rock acts (I am not calling this album that and in general it makes no difference to me how things are called) should listen to hundreds of classics from the 70s because that is where most of the progressive rock greatness lives. Obviously we do get Porcupine Trees these days but they are so rare. I think that Pain Of Salvation knows how strong and rare this album is and that is why even on cd artwork they have divided songs to side A and B, as it used to be done on records. The entire graphic interphase of front and back of the cd cover takes us back to early 1970s. That was the intention of the band and it must be so heartbreaking and disappointing to them to have received such a low overall score from his listeners who obviously must be looking at this work as different from what they were expecting and hoping for.<br /><br />It is so refreshing to listen to this album where it is easy to right away recognize a super solid and specific style of a band, great sound and amazing talent. This music truly breaks boundaries. The overall mood of this album to me falls between Led Zeppelin III, King Crimson's In The Wake Of Poseidon, The Cult's Love, and Black Sabbath's and Counting Crows' debut albums. All great albums and imagine listening to them all together at the same time. I see Pain Of Salvation often listed under progressive metal so I was never personally interested in them but I am so glad that I gave Road Salt One a try. To me this is just a great rock album with songs going through different moods and textures, some of them being quite amazing. The sound of this album is excellent. It has a lot of depth and it feels so full, unstructured and unobstructed. You don't need the best stereo system to feel like you are right in front of these guys playing live. At times the sound comes across dense and traditional as from an old Black Sabbath or The Cult album but then when the acoustic ambient moment comes upon us it almost feels like this music grows in dimension and every detail of sound becomes crystal clear. Many songs contain loose structure and an acoustic envelope of sound. Daniel Gildenlow's voice is amazing. It sounds a lot like the space between the voices of David Coverdale and Carlo van Putten. I really love calm emotional passages he is so capable of. Obviously, coming back from the metal background he is quite capable of the opposite end as well, but these moments rarely come to expression here.<br /><br />Sisters is my favorite song of this album. Wow. I mean, what a concept. Such powerful and honest and intriguing lyric addressed to a girlfriend or wife revealing one's, once upon a party time, feelings towards her own sister would probably come out of Sweden much easier than from many places. It actually comes from somewhere deep inside... It is a gorgeous piano based song with an amazing acoustic sound including the string section. It is a simple beautiful ballad truly one of a kind.  Innocence on the other hand is a very structured song. It contains the most interesting vocal harmonies and it is probably musically most complex. It has this Alice In Chains at its best quality to it with a phenomenal drum beat and dark ambient ending.  Where It Hurts is probably many people's favorite song here. It contains heavier and calm passages of varying time signatures with a brilliant middle moment of truth.  Something about the structure of this song and one of its vocal parts remind me of Since I've Been Loving You, one of my favorite Led Zeppelin's songs.  Road Salt is another calm ballad during which Daniel Gildenlow's voice resembles David Coverdale's a lot.  Sleeping Under The Stars addsso much texture to this album. It is a song performed in its entirety by Daniel alone including all backing vocals and vocal harmonies he was able to create. This is the song that completely reminds me of my favorite King Crimson's early albums. It is the inclusion of unusual instruments like balalaika, mandolin and lute which make this song so interesting to me. There is no guitar on it at all. Linoleum is a two part song and the later part is truly magnificent and contains one of the most interesting vocal harmonies on the album. This is the loudest and heaviest song of the album.  Of Dust is another great mellow acoustic song and it is exactly the mixture of both environments and how well they agree together that makes me love this album...more and more.to this album.

B002ZG999U|4.0|Ever since the emergence of the first modern, high-profile action heroes, fans like me have been clamoring for collaborations between the top names, and now - after almost three decades of fantasizing about heroic team-ups and who-would-win scenarios - director Sylvester Stallone makes this a reality. Sure, he had to forego on a few names that should've been in the movie, and yes, expectations for this picture likely ran so high that it was impossible to satisfy everybody, but the fact is that Stallone has managed to make those performers he did get to swallow their pride and be sized up alongside each other. It's a feat in movie-making that other features only inched towards but which Stallone accomplished and made look good. This is, without a doubt, required viewing for all action fans.<br /><br />The story: An expert team of mercenaries - Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone, [[ASIN:B000ICM5VM Rocky]]) series, Lee Christmas (Jason Statham, [[ASIN:B00008AOVL The Transporter]] series), Ying Yang (Jet Li, [[ASIN:B00030590I Hero]]), Toll Road (MMA star Randy Couture), and Hale Caesar (football hero Terry Crews) - is called upon to overthrow the dictator of a small South American island (David Zayas, [[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter]]), unaware that their target is backed not only by a corrupt US official (Eric Roberts) but also an unbalanced former teammate (Dolph Lundgren, [[ASIN:B0002S94CK Universal Soldier]]).<br /><br />The movie is notable for many promotional reasons, not the least of which for featuring a true supergroup of legitimate action stars from an array of cinematic disciplines. What appealed to me the most, however, is that it's a return to the spotlight for several cast members who have been estranged from big budget films. You could argue this for the likes of Stallone, Mickey Rourke, and cameo man Arnold Schwarzenegger, but they've either already made their comeback or continue to enjoy publicity. Eric Roberts has had to slog his way through too many dastardly DTV titles, but since he was in [[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight]], I never considered him out of the game. The real surprise entries to the cast are the Swedish Superman Dolph Lundgren and B-movie dragon Gary Daniels as one of Roberts' main enforcers, alongside Steve Austin. Since his last theatrical feature of 15 years ago, Lundgren has become a cornerstone of the low-budget action market, supplying hit-or-miss titles alongside Seagal and Van Damme but never really losing his credibility and always looking ready for a comeback. This is only the second film of Daniels' to see a theatrical release in the west, and while [[ASIN:B000034DDT Bloodmoon]] and the like were awesome, it's about time he saw some high-profile action again...and what could be more high-profile than fighting Jet Li and Jason Statham at the same time? Kudos to director Stallone for these picks.<br /><br />Upon hearing of its existence, my hopes for the film's action content were so high that they were impossible to meet, but I'd still say that the movie's gunfights, brawls, and chases are easily among the most pleasing I've seen this year. There's a lot to be said for the adrenaline pieces in general, but I found the most appeal in the decisive match-ups between the credited cast members. In the past, we've only occasionally been able to enjoy showdowns between two high-profile stars (e.g. Stallone vs. Wesley Snipes in [[ASIN:B0045HCJGC Demolition Man]]), but more often than not, big names are wary of taking on other big names for fear of someone appearing inferior. While we do miss out on seeing Stallone taking on either Bruce Willis or Schwarzenegger in anything but a verbal joust, the film does supply us with promising hand-to-hand encounters of Stallone vs. Austin, Austin vs. Couture, Daniels vs. Li & Statham, and Li vs. Lundgren. Not content to give viewers the usual cop-out, director Stallone presents us with real winners and losers - even making himself one of the latter. The Li/Lundgren fight is both my personal favorite of the bunch: though it could've been longer, it's an unbarred martial arts encounter with both performers getting to show off their respective fighting styles - Li as the leaping wushu wizard, Lundgren as the stand-up karate powerhouse - before showing, without a doubt, who the superior warrior is. Fans will be shocked but likely satisfied.<br /><br />The one aspect where the movie really falters, though, is in fleshing out some characters as much as others. This was probably unavoidable, considering how saturated with big names this one is, but it's still disappointing to see some folks billed decisively above others. Stallone and Statham are the upfront stars of the feature, getting more screentime than anybody else and possessing the most personality. Roberts is almost always presented more impressively than David Zayas, and Steve Austin almost makes Gary Daniels forgettable by comparison. Lundgren is excellent as a crazy villain and therein much more interesting than rival Jet Li, who is still afforded more characterization than Couture and Crews, both of whom can't have more than three scenes apiece in which they're not fighting. It's amazing that, in the midst of all this, the movie still had time to establish Mexican TV star Giselle Itie as an entrant to American cinema, but then again, it managed probably only managed so by skimping on the role of Statham's onscreen' ex (Charisma Carpenter, [[ASIN:B000TLTCU4 Angel]]).<br /><br />Production values are strong, especially considering the wide scope of the film and the variety of its locales, although some of the computer graphics looked a bit unconvincing to me. If you're hip to action movies, I needn't comment too much on the acting, which is okay in terms of guys like Zayas, Li, and Statham, pretty good by the standards of Stallone, Roberts, and Lundgren, and very satisfying during a couple of Rourke's scenes. While I was disappointed that the film seems to have been made more in the mindset of modern Hollywood-style productions than 80s/early-90s B-movie ham, it speaks a universal language in terms of big guns, big guys, and big fights, so even a fan of low-budget fare like me can't complain too much. &#34;The Expendables&#34; really is the action opus extravaganza we've been wishing for for all these years, and I recommend it.vorite of the bunch: though it could've been longer, it's an unbarred martial arts encounter with both performers getting to show off their respective fighting styles - Li as the leaping wushu wizard, Lundgren as the stand-up karate powerhouse - before showing, without a doubt, who the superior warrior is.

0553805371|3.0|Stephen Hawking books are generally enjoyable, as was this one, but I was a bit disappointed.  The author rehashed a bit of physics and a bit of philosophy, but neglected to capture me in the crossover.  I was hoping for some new insights, but this book held little that was new to me in either area, physics or philosophy.  It was as if, almost, that Hawking was looking to be controversial, to get on the \\"there is no god\\" bandwagon.  Richard Dawkins does such much more interestingly.  I would prefer Hawking stick to physics, and let philosophers philosophize.
B0000012YO|5.0|Everyone reviewing this set has praised it. Deservedly so; yet I have always missed mention of one element that struck me the first time I heard a movement from it. Let me put it this way: When you hear Kempff, Barenboim, Arrau (or any number of other pianists) playing these sonatas, you are always aware of hearing Kempff etc, playing Beethoven, sometimes wrestling with Beethoven or searching. The first man to do this, Arthur Schnabel, put his personal imprint on this music to an extent we would hardly condone today. The one exception prior to Gilels was Wilhelm Backhaus, who plays in such a self-effacing manner that you can't discern a \\"Backhaus imprint\\". Probably one reason why most pianists look up to him and find it inimitable. Some, like Kovacevich, are so self-conscious about not making a personal mark on the music, that occasionally he slips into the most grotesque egoism.<br />To come to the point: What struck me about Gilels is that for the first time ever I seemed to hear the voice of Beethoven, unadultered. I don't mean Beethoven's piano ( which I think is a trivial concern). I mean that, through Gilels' pianism, I seem to be put in receptive communication with that spirit, as no other pianist has ever done for me.<br />I happen to believe that this is the greatest accomplished one might ever ask of a musician.<br />Whether this makes Gilels \\"the greatest\\" I leave for you to decide. for me, his playing revealed aspects of Beethoven's music that I had not experienced before. I think every lover of Beethoven should expose him- or herself to this kind of experience. Not to do so would be missing on something essential that sound recordings may do for us: so to speak the only good excuse for having sound recordings at all.

B001DHE9KG|5.0|I've seen a lot of video productions of La Boheme, including those with Jose Carreras, Luciano Pavarotti, etc., etc. and so I had somewhat modest expectations for this one, even though I had seen this production in person at the Met a year or two ago (though with a mostly different cast).  Watching it tonight, I have to say that it is--instantly--my favorite one to watch on television.  Splendid and nuanced singing and acting, very insightful conducting, the wonderful, wonderful Zeffirelli production....I could go on and on.  I have long thought that the TELEVISION directing of opera videos from the Metropolitan Opera was superior to those of other major opera companies around the house, and this video re-confirms my impression.

Their love of horror movies and comic books shined through their music and lyrics and became one of the many things that made me love them even more.<br /><br />Their second album ([[ASIN:B00025ETIW Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge]]) brought them to light in the mainstream and gave them a broader fanbase. It added a new sound but kept their horror comic attitude that they've become known and loved for. By this time I had seen them live twice and had almost religious experiences at their shows. I had learned that they not only rocked beautifully live but were super sweet guys from New Jersey.<br /><br />Their third release ([[ASIN:B000I5Y8ZU The Black Parade]]) took them into mega stardom and became the anthem for many My Chem fans new and old. It had music that delved deeper into their dark humor and had a theme that only matched the ferocity of their live show of the same name (which kicked all kinds of @$$! and is the best live show I've seen to date, they even had Muse as their opening act, how much better could it get?).<br /><br />Now, I am 23 and they release their forth album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys! I couldn't be happier. I couldn't be more proud to wear one of my many My Chem shirts or hoodies and say, that's my band! They have a way of evolving with each album's concept, changing into a new band but never leaving the true grit of who they are behind. This album makes me want to rock out, dance, and gets me to really feel the intention of the music and lyrics of the amazing guys I've come to call my music muses. Thank you boys, for never letting me down. Thank you for helping through 7 years of my life when I needed it the most. Thank you Party Poison, Jet Star, Fun Ghoul (as a fellow Italian I appreciate the double humor of that name) and the awesome Kobra Kid. Long live the MCRMY! Gerard Way, Frank Iero, Ray Toro and Mikey Way truly are visionaries and voices for the generation of rockers who love horror movies, comic books and art in all of its crazy beautiful forms!<br /><br />There is no harm in checking this album out. If you're still not sure download \\"Planetary (GO!)\\", \\"Na Na Na\\", \\"Bulletproof Heart\\" and \\"Vampire Money\\" and if you still don't love this band, GET YOUR EARS CHECKED OUT, NOW!Thank you Party Poison, Jet Star, Fun Ghoul (as a fellow Italian I appreciate the double humor of that name) and the awesome Kobra Kid.

B002AOWXO0|4.0|What a pleasant surprise. This is one of the few albums I like almost on its entirety. Tracks such as Shampoo, Blackie's Dead, Search your heart and Wear and Tear that really make it memorable.    I don't think highly of Scarlett as an actress and did not know too much about Pete, but musically they make a great collaboration.    There's a flow on these tracks that almost makes you forget that you have been listening to the whole album and suddenly realize that it is over.
B0040YFR1Y|3.0|great beginning, but doesn't really go anywhere fun.  Better than the last Aliens vs. Predators movie...but on par with the first.    This should have been much better.
1439107955|5.0|It's difficult if not impossible to do justice to this book in any review: its  depth and scope, its humanity and connectedness to the people who inhabit its narratives, its virtuosic inter-weaving of complex, disparate domains (old science, cutting-edge science, history, politics, statistics, public policy, sociology), the lyrical matte finish of its prose -- one can seek to describe these qualities and still not come close to capturing the experience one has reading it.  Like other masterpieces written by very distinctive minds with very distinctive voices (in literature, think Dostoevsky or Proust; in non-fiction, Richard Rhodes or Douglas Hofstadter), to read this book is to enter and become immersed in an astonishing slice of the world that only this particular author could have opened.  Anyone who cares about ideas, or cares about great writing, should pick up a copy of Siddhartha Mukherjee's book immediately.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|I like movies.  I watch a lot of 'em, and even most of the ones I don't like I watch all the way through.  I can suspend disbelief at the drop of a hat, so I guess I enjoy more movies than many.    Well, I watched all of this one, kinda hoping for some glimmer of redeeming value . . . y'know, something to make the story vaguely believable, or any of the characters a tiny bit likeable.  Never happened.  The story was awful, most of the acting was awful . . . or, maybe it's just that Stallone's speech has become nearly as slurred and incomprehensible as it was in the first Rocky movie.  No amount of MTV editing could rescue the action sequences.  The less said about Micky Rourke, the better.    Simply put, it wasn't over the top enough to be funny, but too serious about its gritty realism to suspend disbelief and have a good time.    It's painful to admit, but Giselle Itié and Charisma Carpenter were the most believable characters in the movie.    Don't waste your time.
B003L77TZI|5.0|This album is phenomenal! It's the perfect mix! This album is both fun and emotional! Her songs touched me! Motivated me! Helped me to not feel so alone! Her voice is amazing! The candy scented paper is sweet! HAHA!
B002KSPKRS|2.0|Seemed like a good deal so I got a pair delivered quickly by Amazon.  The usb power plug was cool, but verly little other differences.  I ended up sending them back for a refund because I heard more noises than with my old X4's.  The bass boost slide button was replaced by a push button and I really didn't notice any performance/audio difference between the two.  Amazon's refund was quick and painless.  If you have a pair of X4's, hang onto them.
030726999X|1.0|I guess I am in the minority but what is to see in these books? I really, really disliked them. I read b/c everybody raved. I just don't get it. And they so, so graphically violent. yuck.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|i love this series and can't wait to get the DVD on pre-order of the second series.  It is one of the few shows that my teenagers will watch as a family with us.  How precious is that!!?!
0061537969|4.0|Actually, this book \\"had\\" me from the product description at Amazon. After reading Watership Down, long long ago, I've always enjoyed stories involving animals (and some cockroaches) that have human characteristics. The plot of this book is imaginative and engaging. Readers will experience joy, anger, and heartbreak from this artfully crafted story. The ending is somewhat predictable, but you'll cheer nonetheless. I'm not a race car fan at all, and that's why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.  Those who enjoy this book will also want to read [[ASIN:0312263996 Timbuktu: A Novel]].
B001DHXT1G|3.0|The Bluray version is great. It's an excellent way to watch the movie. My problem is with the digital copy. It has expired and you cannot use it. So if you just want to watch the Bluray this is great but if you are buying this in hopes of using the digital copy like I was, you can't, it expired on 10/31/2010 so it's useless.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have to thank my sister for her influence in my purchase of this DVD.  She was doing it first, swore by it... and I'm not one to let her pass me up!  Here's my two-cents:    LEVEL 1:   - Thought in my head the first time I tried it, \\"WTH?!?  This woman is out of her friggin' mind!  I don't know about all this.\\"   - Thought in my head the next day, \\"OMG!  EVERYTHING hurts!  BRUTAL!  Hmm... that means it's working all of those body parts huh?  Well, although it was terrible, perhaps I will give it some time and see what comes of it.\\"   - Current thought in my head when I do it, \\"Man, this really doesn't ever get fun does it?  Oh well, I look good, I feel good and I really like her style of teaching.  Onward and upward!\\"    LEVEL 2:   - Thought in my head the first time I tried it, \\"Man, she really IS a nut job isn't she?  But, I do like this level better than level 1 for some reason.  It is more challenging, but I really like the exercises more.  I'm cool with this.\\"   - Thought in my head the next day, \\"OMG!  EVERYTHING hurts!  BRUTAL!  I thought by doing level 1 for a few weeks I wouldn't have this happen again.  Dang you Jillian!  Now I am addicted to the pain and the sense of accomplishment.  See you again tomorrow when I can move a little better!\\"   - Current thought in my head when I do it, \\"This level is so much better than level 1, I don't think I will ever do that level again.  I can't believe this is the level and workout that started it all for me and really got the desire and motivation burning.  But I am so glad that it did because everything is different for me now.\\"    LEVEL 3:   - Thought in my head the first time I tried it, \\"Better than level 1, worse than level 2.  But is that my lazy voice?  WHAT?!?  Jumping jacks with weights?  She's a crazy person!  [cursing, cursing, cursing].\\"   - Thought in my head the next day, \\"OMG!  EVERYTHING hurts!  BRUTAL!  I can't wait to do it again!!!  She's still a crazy lady, but I dig it!\\"   - Current thought inmy head when I do it, \\"I still dislike this whole jumping jacks with weights thing, but you can't argue with results!  I love this crazy woman and what she has helped me to accomplish!  I have muscles in places I didn't know I had!  I look pretty sexy in those jeans too BTW.\\"    So, I think you can figure out that I am officially a Jillian shred head and I have since purchased most all of her DVDs (30DS, NMTZ, Shred w/ Weights, Yoga Meltdown and 6 week six-pack), except BFBM because I am a cyclist and get plenty of great cardio from that.  Highly recommended, butt kicking DVD.  GET IT, DO IT, LOVE IT!
1588167461|2.0|If you like men's fashion and want a book that provides examples of fashion icons and a smattering of information on the various pieces of a man's wardrobe, then this is your book.  If you want help deciding what to buy and wear, look elsewhere.  The book uses a lot of words to express very little helpful content.
B003WTE886|4.0|As far as Taylor's ability to write her own songs and sing I'm sold. As for as the recording engineer she needs to hire a new one. One that can keep the sound volume at a level so as not to distort and cut off all the peaks. This recording gives me listener fatigue. Highly recommended.
193413712X|5.0|It's so refreshing to read a book written with real craft. It is not a long book and it is not a page-turner, but rather a book that you can read slowly, in order to savour every morsel. This book is certainly not a \\"bestseller,\\" thank god, and therefore will not suit the masses. But if you are tired of the everyday and want something with depth and soul, this story - of life, the moments of understanding and the reality of relationships - is a worthy read.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|The movie itself is region free. So you can watch the movie' s all versions in your European Or other region PS3 and BD players.   But the bonus material discs are region A and you can not watch them.   Which is a shame because these discs were the ones you pay extra for.   Not the sixteen minutes.   The new scenes are good and they complete the movie but not being able to watch the bonus discs made me deduct a star.   Otherwise both the sound and transfer is amazing. Perhaps the best I ve ever seen in a BD.
B00433QE3M|5.0|This album doesn't cover any new ground, but for someone who enjoys rock and roll, and especially the guitar wizardry of Carlos Santana, it is pretty darn fabulous. The fresh new covers of rock classics performed by Carlos with a great mix of rock vocal stars are a joy to listen to from start to finish.  No rap, just rock. Thank you Carlos.
B003XTUZIM|5.0|Released after \\"Lizard\\", founder Robert Fripp was said to have been exhausted and unsure whether he could carry on with another album.  Indeed, \\"Islands\\" is one of the more fragmented, yet diverse albums to that date.  The original six songs seem to be contradictory in their inclusion.  From the start of \\"Formentera Lady\\", a laid back bluesy number to the final, beyond mellow extended title track.  \\"Formentera Lady\\" seamlessly melds into \\"Sailor's Tale\\" through a simple edit of cymbals.  On the album, you can hear the cymbal edit from one channel to both, but editor master Steven Wilson has crafted yet another masterpiece with this album.  \\"Sailor's Tale\\" begins with an amazing guitar piece by Fripp which sounds as if the guitar is completely out of tune, sequencing into one of the fastest and manic instrumentals yet.  The beat with the mellotron is urgently blasted forth with a wind down of Fripp's unique frazzled guitar sound.<br /><br />\\"The Letters\\" is an odd song for King Crimson (is that possible?), with evil lyrics by Pete Sinfield and Fripp, which has a wild bridge blast of guitar and jazzy brass ending with a bold vocal.  But it is \\"Ladies Of The Road\\" that sparks intense lyrics of misogyny.  Often hilarious in its blatant rhyme, the song still bounces along with tongue in cheek sarcasm.  \\"All of you that the girls of the road, are like apples we stole in our youth\\" and \\"Stone-headed Frisco spacer, ate all the meat I gave her, said would I like to taste hers, and even craved the flavour\\".  The lyrics are just a side track for the bands free-style. The band has fun alternating between the vocals and the sultry, salacious jazz sections.  It's actually a series of bridges with various moods and inventive solos.<br /><br />What follows is one of King Crimson's most perplexing songs I can imagine.  \\"Prelude: Song Of The Gulls\\" would seem out of place, if it were not King Crimson.  This beautifully created instrumental chamber piece is actually a highlight and emphasizes the near schizophrenic collection of songs on the album.  But it's the ten-minute title track that brings the album to a beautiful close.  Slowly building from a calm, patient beginning, the song glides along with an amazing cornet solo.  Pete Sinfield's lyrics are some of his best on this song.  It's a fitting ending to an inventive, if uneven album.  In fact, as a 17-years old, my best friend put this song on right away when he realized I was having a bad acid trip.  It calmed me down.  Not kidding.<br /><br />Sid Smith's sleeve notes reveal a great deal about the mood of the group at this time.  There are also extra tracks and alternate versions. The CD presents a complete stereo remix by Steven Wilson & Robert Fripp alongside a group of additional tracks representing an almost complete alternate album of studio takes, run-throughs and mixes. The DVD-A presents a complete 5.1 surround sound mix by Steven Wilson, in which he sometimes isolates instruments to one channel bringing out the clarity and resonance.  Also here is a hi-res stereo version of the 2010 mix, a hi-res stereo version of the original album mix taken from the 30th anniversary master source and almost 90 minutes of additional material.  Most of this material has never been previously released, including many studio takes mixed from the original recording sessions specifically for this release.  Once again, Steven Wilson and Robert Fripp have reproduced a remarkable series of sessions and brought \\"Islands\\" back to life.phasizes the near schizophrenic collection of songs on the album.

0061914177|5.0|Not sure why all the bad reviews. I think people are looking for a magic bullet or are unaware of what it takes to succeed online. Gary's ideas are simple in nature but exactly what is needed to succeed. You first have to create something your passionate about. That is the only way you will be able to ride out the bad times and stay consistent. Doing that gives you the best chance of success. Then you have to care about your audience. Go out of your way to help them and they will trust you. It's really simple advise but it works. Oh, you also has to work your butt off to succeed. If you want to spend 3 hours total making a site and expect it to bring in $100 per day you might want to get a reality check.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|I received the product promptly.  I found it easy to install.  The light produced is very good and having an on-off switch is a nice improvement.  I like the product.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|This movie is just bunches of fun.  It's bloody and ridiculous.  It's funny.  It's super, super violent.  It's got Danny Trejo playing the best character he's ever played and it's just really fun to watch.  The only reason I put four stars instead of five is because it's about half an hour too long as there are about a hundred extraneous subplots, but four stars is still great, right?  I even loved Jessica Alba in this and I usually find her really annoying, but the movie belongs to the great Trejo.    PLEASE TO SEQUELIZE!!!!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|The DVD is in excellent condition and my entire family LOVES this series, we had to get ALL of the seasons.
B002ZRPQ5K|5.0|I've read the other comments ... I think this is great music ... I like Keane ... and this album is in keeping with their others ... I bought it used for $1.06 ... with no regrets.  I really don't get the one and two star ratings ... buy it ... you won't regret it!
B000O5B4C4|5.0|Blu-ray review.  Although I do not have the DVD version to compare to the Blu-ray version, I was satisfied with the Blu-ray transfer.  It is not as data dense (12-22mbps) as say Avatar (20-50mbps), but it is enjoyable to watch both on the 2.35:1 letterbox setting and my HDTV's 1.85:1 zoom setting.  DVD's generally do not zoom well, losing sharpness.     Movie review: I previously avoided adding Basic Instinct to my film library because the theatrical version, though good, felt crimped by the obvious censorship.  The timing and flow of the movie-house version reminded me of listening to a favorite vinyl record that skips during the best songs; you thoroughly enjoy the song right up to the distracting skip, then you get annoyed or upset.  Hoping for the best I purchased the Unrated Director's Cut, praying it removed the skips and annoyances.  It did.  The uncensored scenes, though not necessarily any more graphic, play the movie's rhythm perfectly, leaving the viewer scene satisfied while building the segue to the next chapter.  The Unrated Director's Cut is absolutely the erotic thriller we all wanted to see after watching the theatrical release.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|My wife and I are long time Battlestar G fans and had much of the series on DVD. But when Blu-ray came out, we yearned for the better sound and picture offered by that format. Recently we found the entire set on serious sale and pulled the trigger. The upgrade is substantial! The series still rocks with great writing, plot and acting, but you probably already knew that. What is amazing and fascinating is the insight that the higher fidelity video gives to the photography and directing choices.    Many scenes in the series are either shot in a lower resolution or are manipulated to look as if they were. You could kind of see that with the dvd, but the blu-ray lays these directing decisions bare and makes them more dramatic. They influence the feel of the series, and the mood is enhanced by the greater contrast between the straight and manipulated scenes. The blu-ray makes it more so, because the changes are more evident.    OK, a few of the special effects are easier to spot on Blu-ray, but that is always the case and it does not reduce the joy and intensity of this work. If you love the series, you need to get the Blu-ray set. If you love sci-fi and are not familiar with the series, this is the way to go.
B003MWHVLY|4.0|Great to listen to when you're in a fun and bouncy pop mood.  Even the slower songs are good, when you want to chill.  Even though Sia's from Australia, I like the very American sound it brings.  I guess it made sense to do that since it was recorded in Los Angeles.
B001AEF6D6|4.0|A laid back slacker (Jeff Bridges) and his high strung buddy (John Goodman) get caught up in a complex kidnap scheme.    \\"The Big Lebowski\\" has amassed a huge cult following, so I came to this film with high expectations.  I enjoyed it, but I must admit that I don't see why it has inspired such devotion that annual conventions are held and books have been written in its honor.  However, it has an offbeat rhythm and there may be more than meets the eye at a first viewing.  The Coen brothers devote as much screen time (or maybe more) to bowling and the men who enjoy such simple pleasures as they do to the busy machinations of the crime and the schemers behind it, which suggests that they have something to say about what really matters in life.  I own a copy of the film, I will certainly watch it again, and I suspect that it will grow on me.
B003QCCS36|5.0|I found this cd because of the \\"trouble \\"commerical on tv for the insurance company, and have bought more of Ray Lamontagne since I got the first one, I really enjoy his laid back type of music, and I love his voice.
B004A8EI9M|5.0|[[ASIN:B004A8EI9M Days Gone Bye]]   I have been a \\"Zombie\\" fan since watching G. Romero's first through my fingers when I was 10yrs old. I was not too sure about anyone being able to make something of this horror genre into a TV series, however so far AMC is pulling it off very well. Hope they can keep up the good work if/for the second season. I am very appreciative that the \\"dead\\" are not Olympic qualified runners!!  I don't buy many TV shows, but this one is worth it. Also as for Amazon's making this available, it is excellent since I work nights, and their download and play on PC system works rather well, no complaints so far. I use W7.
1932100660|5.0|If you want to really take charge of your own destiny with regards to your health, Dr. Campbell's book is a MUST READ. I have been a vegeterian for about 10 years before reading this book and didn't feel I could learn a lot of new things in this regard, but I was wrong.     Campbell describes the three stages of cancer:   Initiation, promotion and progression. He clearly shows how ANIMAL PROTEIN is responsible for all three stages. One of the Key Findings in his 35 years of research is the fact that CANCER GROWTH CAN BE TURNED ON OR OFF, simply through the ingestion or non-ingestion of animal protein.  Dr. Campbell, his research and his book deserve a lot more attention and public recognition than is presently the case.    People should take heed of the vital message conveyed to us by this ground breaking book.   Society and humanity at large owe a great debt to the work of this man.  Stop being a victim of disease and misery, reclaim your God-given right to health and happiness. Take the first step and read this book!  Unlike other authors who have a product to push, Dr. Campbell is a scientist in the truest sense of the word.     What I like best is that the information in this book originates from research of the highest quality, meeting the most rigorous scientific standards. I also like the fact that he is not an M.D., who btw are not scientists at all, but has a doctorate in Biochemical Nutrition.  Society looks to medical doctors for advice on health. What could be more absurd than that?! M.D.'s spend all their time studying and exploring disease. How is it possible to know about health through the study of disease? Modern medical science is a farce and is preoccupied in treating disease, all the while completely ignoring the cause of disease. And the cause of 95% of all disease is lifestyle with nutrition dominating the top of the list.    Thank you Dr. Campbell!
