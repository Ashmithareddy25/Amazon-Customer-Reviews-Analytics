030758836X|1.0|I was having a really good run with bestsellers, so when I saw this one, I grabbed it without hesitation.  I remember reading the first chapter and was SO ready for a smart thriller/mystery...and then nothing happened.  The characters were completely one-dimensional, I couldn't even hate them like the author begged us to do...I just found them unrealistic and total bores.  I forced myself to finish the book mainly because I just couldn't bear with the thought that a best-selling author could write a book this monotonous.  And then, it just got worse.  I think I predicted the \\"insanity\\" part right off the bat.  Moral of the story: boring.  I see there are total opposite reviews here- you either love it or totally loathe it.  Obviously, I am of the latter persuasion.  No wonder it was only available in hardback...very smart on the author's part- get the money before word gets out and the public loses interest.

B0091REZMW|4.0|this hidden objects game seems to have something going for it that many others lack. It gives you the ability to have multiple quests open at one time thus keeping  the perspective fresh and interesting. also for as many levels available as there are the price was well worth it.
B008RYN44U|5.0|Not sure what others expect, I love this record. Songs are mellow and enjoyable on repeat listens. That's the way all the great rock albums are, they take time to make a solid impression.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This critically acclaimed show does not disappoint.  Fantastic acting and story line.  There is nothing predictable about this show.  Great mix of characters and action.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was fantastic!, A page turner that keeps you guessing till the very end! I have to add that I just now read it for the second time, years apart, and I still love this book.  This book has everything that I love, court room testimony, suspense, etc.. It is a book that I do not want to end, while others I cannot wait to finish.  This story is told through Jacob's dad, it is very interesting.  A 14 year old boy is killed and his son becomes the number one suspect.  What would you do if your child may have murdered another?
B005AVIZ6U|3.0|Lee Child's \\"The Affair\\" is another great addition to the series, going back to Reacher's time in the service, it explains his departure from the military and the beginning of his new life as a drifter/vigilante defending the rights of the downtrodden, and just generally getting himself into trouble.<br />The book starts with a confrontation that will keep you guessing as to its significance through half of the book. Lee Child goes to great depths to show Reacher's unswerving devotion to justice, not the military, and this creates what becomes a great story about Reacher's demand for justice, and his falling out with the military.

B007XH6BPG|2.0|I was expecting some virtuosity given the history of these 2 musicians. I think when they sat, if they ever did, to plan this album, they did not know if they wanted to be progressive or pop-the album doesn't seem to be either. They try to engage playing in a couple of songs, notably \\"A life within a day\\" and \\"Storm Chaser\\", but, the songs never seem to climax-the arrangements are quite flat. Perhaps a presence like a Rick Wakeman, or a Tony Banks on keyboards could have help this album more towards a progressive outcome. The presence of Chris Squire is fully diluted into generic bass lines here. Why have him involved if all that was needed was regular linear playing? Steve Hackett's playing is also quite generic and flat. Perhaps, a few arrangements using acoustic guitars in the mix would have work probably a lot better, as it did for Jethro Tull and ELP. Overall, a disappointing album from 2 very good players.
B008E374PO|3.0|Not sure what happened but he seems to have lost the clever \\"edge\\" he had. Feels like this was pumped out in a few days. I miss the way his music was different and did not follow the conventional pop mold.

B005LAIHPY|4.0|Well, I like it. Me and my grandson watch it all the time. It is a little dumb but I still like it.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I loved the show.  I had DVR'd it as it was on, but when I purchased the boxed set, I was delighted by the continuity that watching without commercials provided. There were many pieces I was able to \\"see\\" for the first time.  Although \\"Revenge\\" is almost like watching a period piece (no diversity of character's ethnic, social or educational), its character development more than makes up for the missing diversity.<br />The bonus features were a bonus, providing filler information with the deleted scenes, fashion decisions, etc.  I will enjoy this second season even more, knowing the gift of the boxed set for this season will be coming.<br />One negative, there were a couple of the DVDs where there were 'black' spaces.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|If one was to take on the world of BEING in the spec ops community, then simply TELLING the truth doesn't quite ignite the story. DOING the truth and TELLING the story makes it go BOOM..... it takes great big cajones to put it down in print.  Take it from an old Spectre Gunship troop, this should be required reading for all the suits who think they \\"shoulda, coulda, woulda\\"....... My heart and  soul is with these shooters .....and this man especially.  Just imagine the courage it took to step up and  publish the REAL of it all, despite what the politico may want one to envision!  A must read for all who want answers from those who want votes!
B008O2T3O0|3.0|This review is of the specially priced issue of a previously issued full-priced disc. It comes with a great number of bonus samplers of other Arthaus releases so, in effect, this disc also acts as an Arthaus advertisement. It is important to be sure to buy the much cheaper version rather than the full-priced issue, which is still available, as the Rigoletto part on both discs is identical.<br /><br />The performance is very secure with good solo singing by the experienced Leo Nucci as Rigoletto, Piotr Beczala as the duke plus two attractive female leads in Elena Mosuc as Gilda and Katharina Peetz as Maddalena. Laszio Polgar is a suitably dark Sparafucile. The other solo parts are also reliable as is the chorus.<br /><br />The staging and production could be described as traditional and verging on the effective minimalist. The camera work is very clear and of good colour definition. The sound is presented in DTS 7.1 and stereo and is also very clear. The orchestra plays well under the firm guidance of Nello Santi.<br /><br />For many this has proved to be close to the ideal performance, production and recording. There are others who disagree and have suggested that this is rather a routine performance with poor acting, only passable singing and generally dull. The full range of reactions is fully documented by many reviewers on both sides of the Atlantic.<br /><br />I personally feel that this is better than just routine but, for me, it is all just a bit too clean - some might describe it as lacking in the necessary nastiness. This is not a nice story. The duke is amoral and presides over a dissolute court. Abduction and rape is commonplace (see Gilda's treatment) as is 'legalised' murder (see Monterone's fate) and contract killing (see Rigoletto/Sparafucile). Rigoletto himself takes previously full advantage of his 'privileged' position to taunt any who is not secure, even to the extent where the duke tells him he has over-stepped even his boundaries. Gilda herself chooses to sacrifice herself for a very doubtful cause which fails as we hear the duke blissfully singing unaware at the end.<br /><br />Can such a scenario be found on the stage and on disc? The answer is 'Yes' and the recording is the McVicar concept at the Royal Opera. That too, is well recorded and is well sung and acted. I would hesitate to call it a traditional setting though as it is so corrupt but it is certainly of the correct period and oozes wickedness and venom. However, for me, the problem is the fast vibrato of Paulo Gavanelli who sings the title role of Rigoletto. His acting is fine but I do find the voice vibrato rather nasal or 'bleaty' at times and this is a problem for me. However, I should stress that this is my own personal response although it has been worthy of some comment from some reviewers. Some also have found the production rather too vivid for easy viewing. The opening court scene may be a bit strong for some tastes for example.<br /><br />So there you have it. Buy this if you want a clean version of the opera in traditional staging but, for some tastes, just a little tame. Choose McVicar if you want an altogether earthier version which does not pull any punches but don't expect an easy night's entertainment.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest, in view of the obviously divergent views about this disc, that purchasers need to try and sample it first.<br />There are examples to hear on the web which may be helpful.<br /><br />............................................<br /><br />A note to the anonymous negative voters:<br /><br />The voting system is specifically only about reviews being 'helpful' or 'unhelpful'<br />Goodness only knows what you find to be `unhelpful' about this review.<br /><br />A negative vote without reason is not helpful to anyone. It does not contribute in any useful way to discussion so no-one can learn from you.<br />If you have a different view or find the review 'unhelpful' then explain, giving your reasons,and share your views in the comment option as intended.<br /><br />Your opinion might then add to the total useful advice.useful advice.

0439023513|3.0|I labored over these three books. I loved  every moment until the last few chapters. Come on! Is this suppose to be a book for young people? What was the point? The ending left me disappointed and sad. I spent all this time reading these books only to be left disappointed and feeling broken. If this was a triolgy for any age, the ending was a disappointment.<br /><br />My Victor was left a broken mess, not the person I expected to come out of all this reading, a sad broken person as all the characters turned out to be. Couldn't this author give us one winner out of all this. She doesn't even leave us anything much to know about Gail.<br /><br />I have enough disappointment to hear or know about in one day, I read for comfort, freedom and a happy spirit and soul, not what the ending gave me.<br /><br />Suzanne's ending of this last book seemed to me that she was tired of the story, her characters and gave no thought to the ending except to stamp it as ordinary!

B006H3MIV8|5.0|We didn't know what to expect but decided that there is so much out there that is written by Bob and sung by other great artists that this could be ok. It wasn't until a friend said how much they were enjoying the music that we purchased 'Chimes'. Fantastic! While some of the artists (well, quite a few really) were unknown to us, there are some old favourites singing as well. It is really interesting to hear the different interpretations of some of the material that we know so well from Bob's bootleg series. Well worth the money - 4 albums of great listening! Outstanding.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|...and, of course, a lot of their \\"fans\\" want another shiny dancy pop album. Sorry kids, you're going to get older, too. Here, on this record, the Killers are the band they needed to become. The writing, playing, and singing on this record is that of a band firing on all cylinders, and every song has a hook. Most importantly to me, they finally sound like a ROCK band. The guitars are louder, they do not rely on \\"whoa whoa whoa\\" choruses that date and, quite frankly, ruin some of their earlier material, and Brandon's voice is strong and assured. The negative reviews of this sadden me. It's a fine record by a [finally] great rock band, a real hope for the future of the genre.
B006MPKDUE|5.0|Harry is a damaged hero, yet we all identify with him and want to see him come out on top.

The book is well written and has some surprising twists and turns and will keep the reader interested till the very last word.
B009GENZ12|5.0|This is an excellent work that straddles the line between tense drama and psychological suspense. It starts off slow and almost seems cliche at first, but that's just to lull you into a false sense of having seen this whole act before. Hang in there because it becomes a taught thriller with clever twists and turns all the way to the end. About 30 minutes in I found myself thinking, \\"Wow, what the heck is going on here?!\\" and, soon thereafter, \\"Holy cow, I can't figure this thing out!\\" I was wracking my brain trying to figure out which of the many red herrings might lead to the correct conclusion.<br /><br />As mentioned, during the first 30 minutes the acting seems almost wooden and TV-movie-of-the-week-esque, but there's a reason for that. In truth and in retrospect, the acting is superb, the dialog exceptional, and the script pretty well thought-through. Looking back, I realize there are many neat details that add to the believability of the primary story. Admittedly, there are a few moments that aren't presented or fleshed out particularly well--e.g. the flashback scenes in the diner. Although these gave me pause for thought and caused me to drop suspension of disbelief momentarily, they didn't ruin the overall experience of the film.<br /><br />What's key is that this film isn't just about entertaining or getting your blood pressure up--both of which it does well--it's also deeply thought-provoking social commentary.<br /><br />There really isn't much gore to speak of (it really is psych suspense and not horror). The cursing is minimal and there is no nudity. I'd advise against reading too many reviews prior to watching this movie, by the way. Part of the fun of this flick is trying to figure out what the dickens is going on. For me, this one is worth a second watch.<br /><br />If you like your movies brain-busting, head-scratching, high-blood-pressure-inducing, and thought-provoking, this is one not to be missed.<br /><br />---<br /><br />A related aside: I think the movie's marketing team really made a mistake by making this appear to be a horror film. People looking for a true horror romp will be disappointed by this movie. I suspect that may be why there are so many poor reviews here. Those interested in a horror movie are expecting gore and death and not necessarily brain-jarring twists and turns and subtleties that have to later be analyzed and thought through--something that is required in order to really appreciate this film. Those who liked \\"Red Lights\\" or \\"The Life of David Gale\\"--both movies with twists--will dig this movie. Those looking for traditional horror will be sorely disappointed by The Tall Man.nk the movie's marketing team really made a mistake by making this appear to be a horror film.

B0096DFBZQ|1.0|This game has failed on so many levels. Very awkward control placement was my first issue. The jump button is located in the middle of the screen and hard to reach on the Kindle Fire. Drifting is pretty much impossible when using the accelerometer. The pace is slow, the environment lacking and the graphics subpar. Maybe the other levels are better but I wouldn't know since the game only lets you play the first one before asking you to buy the full version. This is laughable since the experience is obviously so universally abysmal no one in their right mind would pay money for this cheap ripoff. Who ever managed this catastrophe and allowed it to be released has a lot to learn about how this business works.
1609611543|5.0|For years and years and years I've suffered with type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis and they all got worse and worse every year.  I went from taking 500 mg of metformin to 1500mg and my glucose levels only rose higher.  My morning blood sugar levels even with all that Metformin were 150+. I took several medications for blood pressure with horrible side effects.  I took 125mcg of thyroxin with increases every year.<br /><br />FINALLY I went gluten free and within a week, literally one week, I no longer needed Metformin or blood pressure meds and, amazingly, I was able to decrease the thyroid meds by half.  ALL OF THIS IN ONE WEEK!  Now my morning blood sugar levels with NO medication are 70 - 80! The arthritis was so bad in my knee and foot that I used a cane most of the time.  Now I don't use a cane at all and can walk without limping!<br /><br />Within 6 weeks I had lost 25 pounds without trying and felt healthier at age 60 than I have in 30 years.  I felt like I was being eaten alive by autoimmune diseases and now I feel healthy.  I can't even find words to express what that feels like, I feel HEALTHY again!<br /><br />If you have any autoimmune condition I would ask you to just try it.  You have nothing to lose and maybe a new life to gain. And it's not difficult at all.  There are MANY really good gluten free products so you'll never feel deprived.  But even if there weren't substitutes I would NEVER eat gluten again.  For me it's poison.

B0083SBMBM|3.0|While this movie is of course fine entertainment, I was disappointed to discover that the item Amazon is selling is a version intended for sale in Canada. I have noticed this before with some other DVDs purchased from Amazon. The first tip off is that the normal warning screens (anti-piracy, etc) are phrased differently from what is normally sold in the States, referring to 'territories', etc. This is not a problem, but on this DVD of The Avengers, I noticed a couple annoying things:<br />- the DVD is apparently programmed to turn subtitles on automatically, and those subtitles are in French. I had to turn them off to watch normally.<br />- even with the subtitles turned off, every time a character spoke in another language (during the scenes in India and with the Russian criminals), French subtitles appeared on the screen. I don't recall of, in the theatrical presentation, of there were any subtitles in these scenes, but I was unable to get English subtitles to appear in these instances, and could not get rid of the French ones (which do me no good). I tried this DVD in a couple different players and got the same results.<br /><br />I don't know if the DVDs being sold in stores in the States are a different version from the ones being sold by Amazon, but I intend to find out. If the one I buy in a store is free of these inappropriate subtitles (assuming my perspective as somebody from the States), I will be returning this DVD to Amazon and complaining strongly that they lost no other version unless one buys Blu-Ray.
B007P6VLRS|1.0|I loved growing up with this band in the 90's but they've changed for the worse and that's not just because of the obvious split in 2000. It's really sad to see how far the Pumpkins have fallen since their album Zeitgeist, which was half way decent. These lack luster songs which just sound awful and have totally lost the essence of what the Pumpkins were. Understandably the separation of the original band members has no doubt had a huge effect on the bands musical direction. All band politics aside, the music has just taken a terrible dive. Overall this was just a terrible buy and I'm reluctant to ever buy another album again.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Although there were certain lines here and there that were missing, the core of good stuff that make up the original story is definitely there.<br />I didn't read this until college when discussing comics with someone who had read more comics than I had.  Since then it is the model of batman I have compared all the movie renditions to.<br />The inner dialog, the obsessiveness, all things very detailed out and excellent.<br /><br />Peter Weller was a fantastic pick for old batman, his voice has a great gravelly roughness.<br />The pick for Carrie was fabulous, her delivery was spot on in my mind, it a had youthful unapologetic ring to it.<br /><br />They used alot of the cinematic feel of the original book, with the cuts to news coverage and everything.<br />Since this was part 1 they close with joker whispering 'Batman....darling'.<br /><br />The extras include a sweet little min-doc on Bob Kane himself and what a larger than life character he was.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the graphic novel I would higly suggest it.<br /><br />The only disappointing note to me would be it reduces the possibility of a live action adaption.

If you are unchanged after reading Infidel, shame on you!<br /><br />Infidel is the memoir of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali woman raised in northern Africa in the 1960s and `70s. Ayaan spent her earliest years in Somalia during the period of her father's imprisonment by the Somali dictatorship for political resistance, and then fled with her family to Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and Kenya, at every step enduring isolation, suffocating dependency, the abuse of her increasingly embittered mother and grandmother, and the growing strength of the Muslim Brotherhood surrounding every aspect of her life. Ayaan suffered firsthand not only the strictures of her Muslim religion within the family--including genital excision at age 5, constant beatings and mockery, virtual indentured servitude, and arranged marriage--but the increasing fanaticism of the Muslim world around her. As her family more and more closely embraced Islam as the rock in their ever-shifting lives, Ayaan struggled to break free and discover herself as a thinking questioning individual. Eventually, she fled marriage with a husband she had not chosen, hid from a family duty-bound to hunt her down and drag her back to the fold, and sought asylum in Holland, a world as foreign to her as Saudi Arabia would be to most of us.<br /><br />In her new life, Ayaan had to literally re-invent herself. Completely alone, she worked in multiple jobs of every sort to pay for rent, food, and tuition in school, while teaching herself new languages, history, economics, politics, and adopting new cultural paradigms for herself. She eventually became a Dutch citizen and parliamentarian in order to champion the rights of Muslim women, in particular, who constitute a large segment of the immigrants in Western Europe. Her public rejection of Islam led to death threats, tragedy, political crisis, and her eventual flight to the U.S. where she continues to write, teach, and agitate for change. Described as a \\"female Salman Rushdie\\", Ayaan Hirsi Ali has lived a life few of us in the West could imagine and opens our eyes to a reality many in the West choose to ignore in the name of cultural relativism or, worse, political expediency.<br /><br />Infidel is not only the memoir of a strikingly courageous woman, but a frightening reminder that humanity still has a long way to go.

B0098VXE50|2.0|Blockbuster was out of [[ASIN:B0098VXE50 Snow White & the Huntsman (Extended Edition)]] so I rented it from Amazon VOD, I wish I would have waited for Red Box- that's how awful it was. I'll try not to spoil any \\"surprises\\" in the movie.<br /><br />The special effects were alright in my opinion. I'm not a huge action/adventure guru so I'm probably not the best at judging what makes amazing or terrible effects but some parts, like on the trailer when she turns into crows, were pretty neat.<br /><br />My biggest bugaboo was Kristen Stewart. Luckily I never entered the Twilight craze, haven't read the books or seen the movie. What I do know is each movie I've watched with her in it is basically ruined by her nonperformance. They could replace her with a 2x4 wearing a wig and it would be the same effect. She has zero acting ability, it is like a younger, female William H. Macy.<br /><br />The plot is nothing like the Disney movie, obvious before renting, which is why I wanted to rent it. The plot was pretty good, a little predictable, but most are. I do enjoy Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth, both major draws to renting this movie. I found their acting a little short of what I have seen them in previously.<br /><br />Overall, this movie seemed to be reaching and came up shy.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  The storyline was very exciting. However, the first half was more riveting than the last.  The ending was a little less than satisfying to me.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|I have to admit, I had my doubts about this one. It seemed like they were cramming too many heroes in one flick and we might just end up with a \\"Batman & Robin,\\" Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Batgirl, Batman, Robin, Bane combination-disaster.<br /><br />I'm glad to write that I was pleasantly surprised in the case of \\"The Avengers.\\" The way in which the heroes were brought together was done in an entirely believable way, as Loki, Thor's brother, and the villain of the flick, seeks to open a wormhole by which a lot of bad guys can flow through. It seems the earth is the sacrificial lamb for his power-grab.<br /><br />The concept of having a flying aircraft carrier seems like it would be a disaster, and indeed, I mumbled that to myself when it first took off. But that's actually the fun of it. They bring the bad guy on board and you're just waiting for all hell to break loose. (And it does.)<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. was again great as Iron Man and his well-placed dry humor led to laugh-out-loud moments.<br /><br />FINALLY, FINALLY, they didn't mess up Hulk. Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of The Hulk blew his predecessors away. (This was not Ang Lee's Shrek-lookalike Hulk.)<br /><br />Admittedly, similar to \\"Thor,\\" this movie lacks the punch it had in 3D format in the movie theater. But that wasn't enough for me to not give it 5-stars. This movie is a lot of fun and worth owning.

1451662432|5.0|I have a confession to make: I have always been a diehard Ah-nold fan since seeing his highly skilled acting chops in Kindergarten Cop and Jingle All the Way so this review will be very positive and somewhat like hero worship. When Ah-nold left the California governor's office at the beginning of 2011, I was afraid that he would not be able to make enough money to support his high life and his outrageously many children because he abstained from making movies for 8 years to nobly serve the people of California, by running up the state debt and driving businesses out of the state like there's no tomorrow. Now, however, with his new memoir, I see that all is well in Ah-nold Land and that he is able to earn money again in the private sector! Whew! That is one, giant weight off of my shoulders, for sure.<br /><br />I really enjoyed his autobiography because of all the unbelievably little-known revelations I discovered while reading--and I thought I was a huge Ah-nold fan already! Sure, many people know that Mr. Last Action Hero was born in Austria, but did you know that he was already a millionaire before becoming the world's greatest movie thespian (not to mention on the receiving end of countless accusations by various women of groping them in all the right places)? Simply astounding! Simply...unbelievable! Sure, lots of guys and gals also know that Ah-nold served the people of California selflessly for 8 glorious years that made Gray Davis' administration look semi-competent by comparison, but did you also know that, upon leaving office in 2011, Ah-nold admitted to diddling his Hispanic maid/housekeeper/hired help, which produced a love child (read: b/a/s/t/a/r/d) right under Maria Shriver's nose?! Simply amazing! Simply...wait for it...unbelievable!<br /><br />In conclusion, all I can say is that I enjoyed spending almost $20 for this poetic and consummate autobiography, even in this horrible, incorrigible Obama economy--yes, the book is that good! One thing, though, that humanizes Ah-nold, the moderate Republican, very nicely in my humble opinion is a short passage in this autobiography that details how he and Maria Shriver would spend the holidays together. First, Ah-nold's Austrian oma would visit the Schwarzenegger-Shriver household and prepare a bunch of traditional Austrian holiday foods for Maria and the little Schwarzenegger kiddies, such as kartoffelsuppe, schlag and, of course, everyone's favorite, sauerkraut. Both Ah-nold and Maria would even, apparently, roll up their sleeves and help his oma, finding themselves up to their elbows in potatoes, whipped cream and sauerkraut each and every time! To top it off, the late great Ted Kennedy would sometimes waddle in on Ah-nold and Maria and join them in meal prepping. Although no one would ever take up his offer to drive them home afterward.

It is engrossing, and it has changed the way I see many things.  The author packs a punch, and the story has stuck with me, as vivid as the first time I read it.

And I don't know what is wrong with anyone who didn't like this film. The plot is awesome. The story within the plot is awesome. The imagery is off the charts awesome. The little girl is amazingly awesome (and not hard to understand, it called an accent, folks. Plus she's about six shooting this). I don't even like kids and I want to adopt this girl she's so stinking cute. And though I've seen it a million times, I still cry at the end. As soon as she starts to cry, I can't help it. And when she says \\"but she loves him\\" I totally lose it! I also liked The Cell. If you like the imagery in The Fall and like scary stuff, check it out. The Immortals I could have lived without. Have only seen scenes from Mirror Mirror, lots of the same imagery.
0385737955|3.0|The Maze Runner was a book that came recommended to those who like dystopian novels and in general the sort of fiction that's being put out for teens right now.  As most of those can be hit or miss I approached it with trepidation.  The results; I thought it was ok, but not nearly as good as it was hyped up to be.<br /><br />Thomas wakes up in a dark box which rises to the surface of a hostile world.  Here there are just boys who are doing their best to survive, and he's the newbie who's entered their world.  Aside from once a month supply deliveries, they are on their own.  The have their own little place to sleep and grow food, but outside those walls is a maze none of them have been able to solve.  And if they are unable to solve it, they don't get to go home.  The special task of handling this running of a maze is given to the select few, known as Runners.  And you would think solving a maze would be easy when there's so much time to do it; but dark things come out at night, and the maze is always changing.<br /><br />I couldn't really connect with any of the characters in this book.  There were some stand out ones, sure, but the large majority of them just didn't spark that connection.  Especially Thomas, he's our main character and while I can appreciate his intelligence and fortitude, I don't particularly like him and am really sort of ambivalent to him.  The same goes for the only girl in the story, Teresa, who was just a little too perfect.  The only character I really did like was a boy named Minho, who had a bit of spunk to him and was a runner.  There were a couple of \\"bad guys\\" I suppose and the author made it easy to dislike them, so that was saying something at least.<br /><br />The plot was ok.  I liked the maze concept and why they were in there and I thought the ending had a nice twist.  But the pacing was a little rushed and everything seemed to happy a little too easy for the main protagonist.  I realize that it was somewhat supposed to be, but it lessened the sense of excitement and struggle that you wanted to perceive in this book.  Being dystopian, it just should have been harder to do what they were doing.  I did like the beginning though, as Thomas is dropped into this world it has a whole different lexicon that he has trouble understanding at first.  And it's the same for the reader, but as he starts to understand, we begin to understand the different slang terms being used, and that made the book kind of realistic.<br /><br />It's not a bad book, just not up to par with some of the other dystopian series out there.  I will of course read the rest of the trilogy though and hope that it improves with each book.<br /><br />The Maze Runner<br />Copyright 2009<br />374 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B0089IGUP4|5.0|Amazing band, amazing songs as always. I can listen to this whole album over and over without getting tired of it. I highly recommend it if you're into Rock/Punk with catchy songs that aren't too pop or bubblegum. The lead singer has an amazing voice and writes great lyrics.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was really quite good, and I spent all of my free time reading it until I finished. That said, without spoilers, this book crushed my soul. All throughout it I was constantly depressed and upset over what happened to the characters. This is a sign of good writing in my opinion, because I cared about all the characters enough that it physically upset me over what was going on.<br /><br />The ending which I will also not spoil is what really got me though. I literally felt sick and was despondent for the rest of the day and part of the day after. I could not stop thinking about everything. I still find myself thinking about it weeks later. Again, this is a decent sign that somehow the author made me this upset, and mad. I found myself saying \\"WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT\\". Overall, though it was a painful experience in a way, it was one of those that you appreciate for the powerful messages and connections to the characters that the author managed to make you feel.<br /><br /> It is definitely worth it to start and finish the series, but just be prepared for some emotional moments.

Of course, this does not hurt it too greatly. The emotional bonds to the characters, especially Peeta, are formed and grow even stronger, and the hate of the capitol and true understanding of their cruelty becomes understood.

I have had less-than-good experiences buying new material from artists from my youth, but I can easily write it off by saying I've gotten so much enjoyment out of their previous work.<br /><br />Well, this album was better than I could have hoped for.  Mr. Hammill has not changed at all - in the best possible way, his songs continue to surprise and be full of emotion and musicality.  Easily one of my best purchases in a very long time - I hope he keeps this up for decades to come.

B001KVZ6HK|1.0|I was so excited to see this movie, especially since the reviews were so good. But what movie were they watching? A flying aircraft carrier? There is nothing cool or clever about that! Combine that with terrible acting and twenty minutes of lame 3D effects and all I could do from preventing myself from crying over the money I spent on this movie was to laugh. Honestly I wanted to turn this movie off several times, but i had to wait for the action or something interesting to happen - well that never happen! Now all I can do is hope I can get some of my wasted money back and try to sell this \\"bomb\\" to a used discount store. So to sum it up - save your money and be glad you did.

I've seen it at least 10 times.

So I went and bought another of the plan DVD copies.<br /><br />I've also read that some goof whats to make another one.  How can anyone even think of making a new one.  This is the one and it CANNOT be duplicated.<br /><br />If a new one IS made, may it be doomed to fail.

0201633612|1.0|This book is way out of date by now. Singleton for an example has been a clear antipattern for years now. The rest of them are poorly explained or more complexity than they're worth. Overall the concepts of this book are workarounds for the short comings of strict OOP. Avoid over-complicated inheritance hierarchies and this book is pretty much unnecessary.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I pre-ordered The Casual Vacancy, looking forward and curious to read a different genre written by Ms. Rowling. I could only get through about 12% of it before I quit reading it. It was depressing and it was hard to keep up with too many varied characters. I am a mature adult and loved the Harry Potter series. I supposed I anticipated a faster paced story. I would rate this book similar to many of the Oprah Book Club selections which I quit reading a long time ago. They also got to be too depressing. I don't mind a book with lots of interesting characters, but since I don't like reality shows, these characters were too much like unpleasant, conniving reality players to be part of an enjoyable read. And I do read for enjoyment because my life is real enough.

The whole story was like a build up to something that never happened. Very anti-climatic. I kept looking and making sure I didn't skip any pages after I reached the end. The book did a very good job portraying the masks that we all wear but I just didn't enjoy it.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|This is my second Otterbox Case. My first was for a Galaxy S. Compared to that, I find this case a bit inferior. The Galaxy S case had a plug that went into the audio port to keep dirt out. This as only provides flaps. The Galaxy S case had a rougher texture on the back, which meant that scratches did not show up even after constant use. Otterbox has chosen to use a smooth finish on the back of this case, which annoyingly gets scratched easily. However, the case itself does its job well. Its robust and absorbs impact well and is built to a top quality, like any other Otterbox. On the whole, I would still recommend this to anyone looking for a good case.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|There is no doubt that Michelle Williams is a very talented actress.  In this movie, she shines; she is the perfect pick to play Marilyn Monroe.  From start to finish, her performance is strong and convincing.  Story is told from point of view of a young man Colin, from privileged upper class (he is British) who wants to make his own way in the movie business.  He is only 23 and is well connected; his godfather is royal librarian and his family personally knows sir Laurence Olivier, one of the greatest clasically trained actors of his time.<br /><br />As Olivier decides to make a movie in which he will start with Marylin Monroe, young Colin gets determiend to become part of the director's team.  He uses his connections to find out names of the people who can arrange Marilyn's stay in England by finding her a quiet and secluded house rental dutring the week of her filming with Olivier.  When Marilyn finally arrives, with her husband of three weeks, writer Arthur Miller, everyone is smitten.  Her presence is magnetic, but her insecurities, her tardiness and blind devotion to her acting coach is driving everyone mad. When Miller leaves her during filming to visit his family, Marilyn strikes friendship with young Colin.  He seems to be the only one to give her a peak to what it is to live ordinary life, without any pressures of Hollywood, fame and relentless admirers, journalists and photographers.  During the week that they are together, Colin gives Marilyn kind of friendship she deparately craves. Colin falls in love with Marilyn and pays the price in the process; his brief relationship with costume girl from the crew falters, Marilyn returns to her husband and Hollywood and Colin's unique experience helps him establish himself as a professional, capable of joining \\"the circus\\" as Laurence Olivier tells him at the end.<br /><br />This is extraordinary film because it gives a glimpse of Marylin from a perspective of a young man, still uncorrupted and innocent.  Like most life changing events, for Colin this moment in his life is a kind of experience he will never be able to shake off.  But it is also his way of making his own way in the real world of which he knows so little about...This movie is based on a memoir, Colin Clark wrote in 1990s about the experience from 1956.st life changing events, for Colin this moment in his life is a kind of experience he will never be able to shake off.

1611747511|5.0|This book is a perfect example of how economics should be done. Rather than beginning from a very general ideological standpoint (government is the solution, or government is the problem) and then attempting to marshall arguments for that general standpoint, the authors of this book stay close to the ground, synthesizing an amazing amount of empirical evidence, in an attempt to analyze the causes of poverty, and possible solutions. Only by understanding the causes of poverty in detail is it possible to devise solutions that are actually likely to work.<br /><br />I listened to this book in the car over a long period so I am not going to be able to summarize all the details from memory but I will give an example of what I mean. The reader should be aware that this is only a single example. There are many more examples in the book.<br /><br />There are, as the authors outline, two general ideological camps in the poverty debate. There are what the authors call the \\"supply wallahs\\" and there are the \\"demand wallahs\\". The supply wallahs, like Jeffrey Sachs, tend to believe that poverty is largely the result of \\"poverty traps\\", situations where a person's current poverty makes it impossible for them to take the steps necessary to lift themselves out of poverty. Supply wallahs tend to support forms of aid because aid is supposed to allow those in poverty to escape from such poverty traps, at which point they are then able to support themselves. The problem is that aid often fails to have the desired effect, and those in poverty often fail to act the way supply wallahs predict that they should in response to aid. This has led the demand wallahs, like William Easterly, to argue against the general efficacy of aid. Demand wallahs argue that the escape from poverty has to be demand driven. As soon as those in poverty begin demanding services that have the potential to lift them out of poverty, like education or medical services, the market will react and supply them. The demand wallahs argue, therefore, against the efficacy of aid, since it does no good to give people things they do not want and will not use.<br /><br />How does this abstract debate play out on the ground? One example I remember from the book is the issue of contraceptives. Those in poverty tend to have a lot of children. This can give rise to a poverty trap since poor families rarely have the money to educate large families and this tends to perpetuate poverty. The supply wallahs might argue that the solution to this problem would be to provide poor families with free contraceptives so that they can limit their number of children. The problem is these policies have not succeeded in having the desired effect. The demand wallahs, therefore, argue that as soon as the poor start demanding contraceptives they will be supplied.<br /><br />Rather than choosing a side, and presenting some very general arguments in support, the authors of this book decided to do something radical. They decided to ask poor families why they had large families. It turns out that a lot of poor families consciously choose to have large families as a kind of social insurance. Parents need someone to take care of them in their old age, and the more children they have the more likely it is that at least one of them will be willing to do so. One can see immediately why neither the supply wallahs, nor the demand wallahs, have an adequate solution to this problem. Supplying the poor with free contraceptives does no good if they do not use them, and they will not use them as long as they consider having large families an advantage. Similarly, waiting around until the poor start demanding such services on their own is not going to solve the problem, because as long as the poor need large families to insure their future they are never going to demand such services. As long as the arguments remain at a very general level (whether the escape from poverty is supply or demand driven, etc.) the real solution tothis problem remains invisible. Once we understand the problem, however, it becomes possible to devise actual solutions.

B003274QH6|3.0|Everything has been thoroughly covered in all of the above reviews about this great drama series. I saw Breaking Bad on standard DVD and AMC, so I bought the BluRay. I was totally disapointed in the picture resolution. The grain is a constant distraction, especially of blue skies and dark scenes. To call this \\"high def\\" is just totally wrong and a unnecessary ripoff, since I'm sure they have the technical ability to produce a perfect picture such as Boardwalk Empire. Shame on you for taking my money under false pretenses.[[ASIN:B001DJLCRC Breaking Bad: The Complete First Season]]
B008ASLK8A|4.0|In this Sherlock Holmes sequel, the legendary detective and his sidekick Watson must work together to bring down Professor Moriarty, an evil genius who always seems to be one step ahead of Holmes. The two travel around Europe and engage the help of a gypsy troupe in their quest for answers.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Robert Downy Jr. reprising his role as Sherlock Holmes. I was laughing out loud during many of the scenes, and I love the Holmes/Watson bro-mance. I also think many of the action scenes were really well-done. I took away one star from my review just because I felt like the mystery in this movie didn't play out in true Sherlock Holmes-fashion. The focus was clearly on the action, and not so much on putting together clues and solving the puzzle.<br /><br />If you were a fan of the first movie, I would recommend watching this one- it won't disappoint!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is a fantastic site/app. The look and organization of it is very straightforward and uncomplicated. One thing I would change is the member's ability to look at a certain number of pins at a time. On my kindle I am able to look at only one pin at a time (via browser) and I love that because it gives me a chance to take in the picture and doesn't give me sensory overload by showing me 15 pictures at once.<br />IF perchance I am completely wrong and there is a way to change the view, someone please let me know. I'd love to have that option on all my devices and computers. Also would like a \\"pin it\\" button for the kindle, but I'm not sure if that's a pinterest issue or a Kindle issue :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have a lot of fun with this game. i am so addicted. A co worker told me about this game and I haven't put it down since.
B004EIZCPM|2.0|As a teacher of teens (currently on a sabbatical) I am always on the look out for films that will appeal to this age group and provide good material for discussion, and possibly a valuable message about life.<br /><br />Did Easy A deliver? I guess some students would really take to this film and there is plenty of scope for discussion, but ultimately it was a big let-down for me.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there are some really funny moments in the movie, and for these moments alone the film is worth watching, but I happen to like my dialogue peppered with a strong dose of realism, and this was sadly lacking. This movie is just so smug and self-aware that it is quite nauseating at times (like Juno, another movie I couldn't stomach). Now I could deal with the bad dialogue and constant stream of one-liners that turn the characters in caricatures, but the thing irked me the most was that Easy A makes such a big deal about how liberal and \\"contemporary\\" it is. In reality the message of this movie is highly conservative and reinforces all the tired clichés about finding prince charming and living happily ever after. Oh yeah, and good girls always get their man in the end. Pass me the bucket.<br /><br />Why did the main character have to be a virgin? As this film is all about sexual politics wouldn't it have been a whole lot more interesting if she was an actual \\"slut\\" (ie. anyone who is not a virgin in the context of this film) who, based on her experiences, decided to make a stand about the rigid double-standard that is still alive and kicking in high schools around the world? When she started dressing like a scarlet woman and sewed the A on her clothes, I found it very unconvincing and condescending not to mention confusing. What exactly was she trying to say? Fair enough she had a case when everyone started gossiping about her after they thought she'd slept with one guy, but when she agreed to let people believe that she'd slept with pretty much anyone who asked(and for money) the film loses all right to a serious message.<br /><br />Did she think that young women she be free to go around exchanging sexual favors for money at school without condemnation? How was she standing up against the sexual objectification of women by dressing like a prostitute for most of the movie? Why were there no actual \\"sluts\\" in the film that she could have developed some solidarity with? What the hell was the musical number about at the end when she jumps out of a woodpile like a stripper at a bucks night and proceeds to prance around the auditorium in lingerie? (while the principal does nothing to stop her!). I think this was meant to be empowering but I'm not sure how, especially as the whole thing was orchestrated with the help of her new boyfriend.<br /><br />The movie was clearly trying to draw parallels between the way women were treated in the times of the Scarlet Letter and today, but at least the Scarlet Letter was about a real \\"slut\\" ie. someone who had broken the unspoken rules of a patriarchal society and paid the price. By making the main character a virgin (and her best friend too), this film is tacitly reinforcing the idea that girls who have sex are sluts. It's no coincidence that the only female character in the film who does have sex is the school counselor (and Olive's English teacher's wife), who is committing adultery by having a highly unethical relationship with a student. It's also no coincidence that Olive is persuaded into lying about having sex out of a desire to help the socially challenged boys who seek her out - in others words she is a very good girl indeed.<br /><br />How is this in any way helpful to the millions of teenage girls around the world who do choose to have sex and then have to grapple with the double-standard when they are labeled as sluts? Young girls are bombarded with so many images and messages today that tell them that to attract boys that need to look and act like porn stars, but when do thisthey are often judged and ostracized. So-called \\"raunch culture\\" is something that I feel strongly about because I think it's just so damaging to young women, especially the ones with low self-esteem who are more likely to try to gain acceptance through sex, and in my opinion this film did nothing to challenge any of this. In the end it reinforced the negative and confusing stereotypes that it was claiming to challenge by sending the message to women that they need to be highly sexualised but also pure and virginal at the same time - the virgin / whore thing all over again.<br /><br />A truly courageous film would have made the main character a much more complex and interesting person. Someone that has had sex (for real) and earned herself a reputation, and then decided to do something about it (the best movie I've ever seen along these lines is Chasing Amy) That would have been a message worth listening to, and the gorgeous Emma Stone could easily have pulled it off. She also would have been a much more relatable character for the \\"scarlet women\\" of today who can't go on facebook and announce that, hey it was all just a big joke and they didn't actually have sex with those boys. In a perfect world young women would wait for the right guy to come along and sweep them off their feet, but we don't live in a perfect world, and this film's ultimate message is that abstinence will be rewarded. Not a bad message in itself and I agree that girls shouldn't rush into sex, but let's not pretend that this is groundbreaking stuff that does anything to challenge the double standard.<br /><br />I know the film thought it was being ironic through references to 80s movies, but at the end of the day it really is just another ideological fantasy dressed up as a hip, wise-cracking, self-referential comedy. As far as teen movies go I much preferred 10 Things I Hate About You. At least the two main characters had a little bit of grit - Kat had slept with the wrong guy (for real, not pretend), while Heath Ledger's character was a juvenile delinquent. The musical number he performed actually fitted into the film and was so much more romantic and enjoyable than the terrible song and semi-stripper performance at the end of Easy A!<br /><br />Sorry, but this film gets a D from me.
B003WJ9DYA|4.0|Old'y but goody yes it has tom cruse but this was before he got to his jumping on couch stage, Plus all can be forgot by other cast members like Tim Curry His makeup alone makes the film worth watching at least once.
B003204MQS|4.0|Based on some of the reviews I've read people either loved or hated this movie. I fall into the former group because I found it genuinely scary and unsettling - despite the fact that my sister had already recounted the entire plot to me in detail. The true test of a horror movie is if it leaves you jumping as you try to get to sleep that night, convinced that you heard SOMETHING outside. Well this film definitely passed that test for me.<br /><br />The hand-held camera work took a while to get used to, but once I adjusted to it the film really dragged me in (no pun intended - if you've seen the film you'll get this rather lame attempt at humour). I really love subtle films that take the time to build suspense and don't bombard you with special effects. What made this film so successful though was the realistic dialogue and excellent acting. I found it very easy to believe that this was a real-life couple and that I was watching a homemade recording of their lives. When the paranormal events start to happen with increasing frequency they are genuinely creepy. One reviewer made the point that: \\"When you're watching time-lapse film of two people asleep in a dark room, it's surprising how little it takes to scare you\\". I think this is because the film reminds people of just how vulnerable they are when they are sleeping and taps into the primordial fear we all have of what lurks in the darkness. The image that stands out the most in my mind is of Katie standing next to the bed in a zombie-like state staring at Micah as the camera ticks over for hours, and he sleeps on obliviously.<br /><br />Just as all horror films have deeper meanings, I believe this one is about the dynamics of the couple's intimate relationship, and this is supported by the fact that much of the film footage is of them in bed together. Katie's \\"demon\\" symbolizes her inner frustration and anger with Mica, who is an arrogant fool in so many ways. Despite the fact that she has been experiencing paranormal events all her life, he refuses to listen to anything she says and carries on antagonizing the demon even when things begin to get very freaky. He refuses to let Katie consult an expert, brings an ouiji board into the house despite being told it will invite the demon in and goads the demon to give them more evidence of its existence. Katie tells him repeatedly that they need to ignore it and get on with their lives, but he continues to follow her everywhere with the camera, causing her even more anguish and distress. Is it just a coincidence that at the end of the film she hurtles his body directly at the camera?<br /><br />Despite the fact that they are clearly dealing with something paranormal Micah continues to search through the house, thinking that he is going to find it, showing that he is incapable of helping Katie because he can't open his mind and accept that there are some things he can't understand or control. The fact that this is tied up with his masculine pride is made obvious when he says that he won't admit defeat or seek help because no demon is going to come into his home and mess with his woman. It is revealing that when in a zombie-like state one night Katie leaves the house and Micah finds her hours later sitting out on the verandah in the freezing cold. The house symbolizes their relationship and by leaving it Katie is acting out her desire for escape. When Micca tries to get her to come back inside she initially refuses.<br /><br />According to my interpretation this film can be read as a comment on the limitations of the modern male (LOL), and Katie's demon represents the murderous urges that lurk inside all women who have to put up with him. To be fair it's not just men who can be incredibly annoying to live with, so I guess you could say it's about the repressed anger and frustration that everyone experiences to some degree in intimate relationships. Films like this terrify us by giving us a glimpse of the demons that lurk in our own subconscious and only come out at night in our dreams, while also providing some catharsis. (I found it quite amusing that the film was shot in the director's own house and that his \\"girlfriend at the time\\" found it hard to deal with the 24 hour film set - their relationship obviously didn't survive
0143119680|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy books I have read in ages.  I normally tend to stay away from books that have too many different types of characters.  In other words, I don't usually enjoy it when all the monsters come to the party, I'd prefer it if some of those invited stayed away, in hopes it may be less confusing.  Even though from almost the outset, A Discovery of Witches has quite a variety of creatures, it never gets overwhelming and the author manages to keep things well-organized.  The author has a background in history and is very detail-oriented, without becoming boring.  The chaotic world of the story is very challenging and exciting, with numerous twists and turns, and the book is very enjoyable to read, leaving me eager for the next book in the trilogy to be completed.  I look forward to reading more by this author.

B008SOS63S|5.0|Don't let anyone tell you John Hiatt derailed the momentum on this incredible Live CD.

I bought the CD's because of the Live viewing of the concert.  I was not, in the least, disappointed. Neither will you be. And remember:  It was P.T.

B0095R64AO|4.0|Jason Siegel and Emily Blunt have amazing chemistry in this movie. A bit of a long movie, but moved well and so worth it for the ending. A good story that even a guy wouldn't mind watching.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Asia, and Japanese anime in particular, is prolific at creating hybrids of unlikely genres and themes, but the excellent Summer Wars is one of the most unique yet - crossing a highly quirky and touching [[ASIN:B000CDGVOO Whisper of the Heart]]-type tale with a visually mindblowing technothriller with apocalyptic touches.<br /><br />Math genius Kenji is a student who works part-time as one of thousands of freelance programmers for 'Oz', a near-future unbiquitous cyber-entity that basically is connected to everything (imagine if YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Tweet, Google, the world's banks, and all the governments's computer data networks merged into a single huge conglomerate).  During holidays, his dream girl Netsuki - with whom he has only a casual acquantaince - convinces him to do a small favor for her - return home with her during the holidays and pose as her boyfriend.  (Why she's so frantic to find someone to fulfill this unusual task is part of a wonderful little subplot that unfolds as the movie goes along)  This favor is not exactly a hard sell for Kenji, it's more like winning a precious fantasy come to life.  Shortly before departing, in an unconnected event that will later have deep reprecussions during the vacation at Netsuki's family country home, Kenji is one of numerous people around the world who receives a mysterious email challenging the recipient to solve a numbers/logic puzzle.  Turns out, Kenji is the only one on the planet who manages to complete the task.<br /><br />Meanwhile, as all this is going on in the real world, you see a lot taking place within the Oz network, where users enter a virtual reality type domain using imaginative avatars for everything from socialization to communication to banking to virtual gaming and beyond.  The visuals and imagination and use of color inside the Oz-world are just amazing.<br /><br />As events unfold at Netsuki's family home (a really cool, unusual tale full of memorable characters, effective drama andthe kind of genuine comedy that so many movies in the comedy genre fail to attain) the seemingly impossible happens: the Oz network is hacked, putting everything from personal information to traffic control to the electricity grid and even the codes for nuclear weapons in unknown, ominous hands.<br /><br />I'm not going to reveal any more of what happens here, I may have said too much already (even though you kind of get most of this from the back of the DVD box); the surprises are better left experienced rather than given away in spoilers.  I'll just make a few random observations: Kenji and Netsuki are one of the best couples to appear in a romantic movie, with a rare chemistry that really makes you root for them to get together.  The entire cast is quirky and excellently done - one thing I noticed is how the children of the family, often seen doing their own thing in the background, seem so lifelike in their little ways and mannerisms.  The visuals are great throughout, and inside Oz they just get progressively more awesome as the movie unfolds.  The climaxes to the movie's various plots are tremendous.<br /><br />Summer Wars is up there with anything Studio Ghibli has done (I consider that the utmost praise) and is one of those movies that makes you wonder why on Earth anime has, outside of Asia and a couple other countries, yet to break out beyond its dedicated cult following (of which I consider myself part) and start being embraced by legions more fans.

B0079K4WEE|5.0|This film is a feast for ALL of the senses!!I love this movie!! It is one of the best independent films of the year in my opinion.It is hard to categorize it because it fits in so many genres.The narration of Eva Green,The storyline,acting and writing are topnotch, and the classical violin background music and cinematography are exquisite!!There are so many apocalyptic films,especially coming out today hence the dire times we are in,but this one is so original and special.I processed it for weeks after because it is so provocative and poignant.I don't want to give any of the story away because I don't want to spoil the surprise of the film.I saw it blindly,not really having a clue what it entailed,and I think most viewers would enjoy it more this way so they don't know what to expect.Also there are already descriptions of the storyline on here.I simply grabbed it out of a kiosk because I saw it starred Ewan and Eva Green and I love them both.If you would like to see a romantic,visceral,sci-fi thriller that REALLY makes you feel and really makes you think,than this film is for you!!!I absolutely had to have a copy and was compelled to share it with people close to me.It is too bad is didn't get much publicity because most people are not even aware of this beauty, however it did win an award in the UK.It is a very dark film, and it might make you weep as I did, but I still had to see it again and again.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Great movie and a great story. Before I bought DVD I had to buy on demand like 5 times for my daughters. They love this movie and wanted to watch it all the the time.

The only way I got it to work was on my first generation iPod Touch. This is quite upsetting because I was looking forward to getting rid of the iTouch because I have the classic now that can actually fit all of my music. It works great with the iTouch, but that is not what I bought it for, and I got no help.

B003O86FMW|5.0|book was hard to put down once you start. I thought it was better than the first. Would highly recommend
B0067AC5KA|4.0|The trilogy is good, well written, a good triller. Characters are interesting although too unrealistic: it would be better if at least some of them were closer to real life. It seems that the author took some very particular types of persons that are not easily found anywhere and decided to build the history around a group of them each of whom are a different and very surreal type.<br /><br />At times it seemed too much imagination for it to be believable. It is entertaining but somewhat exagerated. The first book and the last are the best although one need  to read all three in order to understand the history.
B009329ZF2|4.0|This wasn't a highly rated movie by critics nor did it do well at the box office.  I don't know what people really expect out of movies any more, it was just a fun movie, wasn't a real \\"thinking\\" kind of movie. I wasn't a real fan of the aline premise but that's just me, but everything else was really good.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is my favorite band & couldn't wait for this CD to be released. Not only is their music wonderful, but their lyrics are so intelligent & moving. I just love this CD!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I rarely bother seeing movies in the theaters, but this is one I choose to go do it. It was great. I could not wait until I got it home to watch, and now that I did, I am still thrilled with it.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of action, an interesting story line, and the characters all have a backstory which even if you did not see the individual titles leading up to this release, I think you could follow. Yes, there were references back to things that happened in the other films, but I think any one would enjoy it as a stand alone.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, intend to take a weekend soon and watch both Ironman movies, both Hulk movies, Captain America and Thor again before once again watching this movie.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing all the extras included in the next couple weekends.
B000FZETIO|3.0|This is that one film that has been redone a thousand times, especially by Freddie Prince Jr. in the mid-90's, and so even though I saw it for the first time this past weekend, it was like I had seen it a thousand times before.  That said, the film is so generically 80's that it was almost like a breath of fresh air.  I relished in the dated quality of the film because it made it feel new and different.  Sadly, Ringwald is dull as a doornail and she really drags this film down a couple pegs.  I just couldn't invest in her because she bored me to tears.  Thankfully the rich supporting cast brought the film up, with Jon Cryer, James Spader and Annie Potts nailing their roles and grabbing our attention.  Cryer's take on `Try a Little Tenderness' was the film's biggest highlight, and Spader's perfected soullessness is fun to watch.  I felt like the script was really skeletal in parts, almost laughably so.  When Andie has this heart to heart with her dad about her mother leaving them, it felt so underwritten it was pathetic.  Still, the predictability factor doesn't hinder the smile on my face, it was the boring leads that did that.  It's funny to see what Cryer has become.  Ah, 80's nostalgia.  Gotta have it or make it stop?  Despite the fact that this film gets a middling grade from me, it's an enthusiastic one so I'll vote `gotta have it' and settle in for yet another 80's classic!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|not quite the original but still great. I mean I'm not 10 either though so that probably factored in. Oregon. Oregon. Oregon
B0002WZTOI|3.0|How I missed `Top Gun' my whole life is beyond me, but am I the only guy out there who just assumed that if Tom Cruise and Meg Ryan were in the same movie they would be the lovers?  I was kind of shocked to see Kelly McGillis in the lead and then I remembered that this was 1986 and McGillis was coming off of `Witness' and Meg Ryan still had three more years before she'd fake moan her way into superstardom.  Alas, with the devastating loss of Tony Scott, I decided to watch this finally (been sitting on my DVR for over a month) and I must say...it's kind of `ok'.  I mean, it flows and it has movement, but the film is so cookie cutter and generic.  There really isn't anything special about the film at all.  The use of music was disastrous as well.  The way they played `Danger Zone' over every scene in the first half only to switch to playing `Take My Breath Away' every time McGillis and Cruise were in the same room was somewhat nauseating, and that final scene (party on the base) was just so corny.  But I loved Anthony Edwards in this!
B005LAIHPY|3.0|I was in no rush to see BATTLESHIP knowing it was based on the Hasbro game and it had not been well-received by the critics or public. I did not know the story and imagined battleships fighting each other on the high sea. BATTLESHIP became a must see when I saw that lovely, sexy singer Rihanna was one of the stars. Rihanna? In an action film? Really? It was worth a look.<br /><br />BATTLESHIP is off to a slow start. A troubled loser with no future joins the Navy as a last resort. Despite his bad attitude, he shows potential and moves up in rank. Is any of this a surprise? How about the fact that he is in love with the admiral's daughter. Any surprise there? Our hero butts heads with all of his superiors and is about to be thrown out of the navy when it happens...<br /><br />Scientists have discovered a planet that seems to be in the right position from its own sun to be a twin of earth. Maybe life exists so signals are sent from earth to this distant planet to make contact. Here was the huge twist from what I expected. What happens if the aliens receive the signal and decide to come visit their \\"brothers\\" on earth?<br /><br />Suddenly, BATTLESHIP has some potential as the alien spaceships are seen. Here come in the amazing visual effects and possibly an interesting story. Are the aliens here as friends or conquerors? What are their intentions. At first it seems they are interested in destroying machinery and not out to destroy humans. There is a bit of confusion here. The US Navy fires first and maybe our alien friends are just in self-defense mode. The visual effects are amazing and we get to see human-like aliens. How would life develop on a \\"sister\\" planet light years away. It is an interesting premise.<br /><br />Unfortunately, amazing visual effects can't always save a film riddled with clich&eacute;s. BATTLESHIP is a combination of so many films we have seen before. It's part JURASSIC PARK and INDEPENDENCE DAY. Add in Pearl Harbor since the on land part of the story takes place on Oahu with a connection to Pearl Harbor and the Japanese are involved again (as the good guys) attacking Oahu.<br /><br />Apparently, the director thought Rihanna would be good in the role of a sailor and she was eager to do a movie role. It's hard to imagine Rihanna as a sailor helping to save the world but the woman is talented. I guess she could help save the world.<br /><br />BATTLESHIP misses so much of its potential. Why not have the aliens come with a clear message. What do they want? We learn they have one problem with life on earth. There always has to be one simple problem that aliens can't cope with on earth.<br /><br />The movie drags on. The beautiful daughter of the admiral obviously will have some role in helping to save the world while her navy man is at sea. Lian Neeson is the admiral and suprisingly this is a relatively small role for Neeson. Maybe he needed the work.<br /><br />BATTLESHIP is worth seeing because of the phenomenal special effects but if a good story is important you, this is a film that can be missed.takes place on Oahu with a connection to Pearl Harbor and the Japanese are involved again (as the good guys) attacking Oahu.<br /><br />Apparently, the director thought Rihanna would be good in the role of a sailor and she was eager to do a movie role.

B008B11R1Q|5.0|I can not stop listening! I enjoy every sound. It's magic! I buy a second \\"Coexist\\" CD, and I think it will not be the last.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked the book,can't wait to read the next one! My son really likes the books as well and has been reading them for class.
B005V1WYZC|5.0|I heard plenty of hype when this movie was in trailers. When it released I expected a watery rom-com with one or two good-looking folks in it. The first time I watched this movie, I was alone at a matinee. And I was so disppointed that I had no one with me to laugh and share the moments! There are things in this movie that hit home with me. I think many men sometimes get to that point in their lives where they stop seeing the use in trying. And sometimes the results aren't pretty. But in this movie, the comedy and the timing are well done. The best parts of the movie are those moments when you aren't really sure what else could go wrong for the main character and then he does something else to show you there's plenty more. And yet, somehow the hope is never completely lost. Emma Stone does an amazing job, as always. I was crying at some points and cheering in others. Without giving away spoilers, I have to say Jonah Bobo steals this film with his chubby pre-adolescent adorkableness! He does a fantastic job with his role. As do the others with more experience under their belts, but this young actor's perfect portrayal of almost inappropriate weirdness really sells his part!<br />I now own this DVD, and believe me it gets a workout in my lineup of favorite movies to watch on a random, rainy day! I absolutely loved it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really feel like I got know Auggie because of how well written this book is. At first, it's Auggie telling the story of what it is like to have facial deformity, and then it goes on to other people's opinions on what it is like to live with, be friends with, or know someone who lives with a person who has a facial deformity. I really love how Igot the author's point on how he may look different, he is still a kind and loving person on the inside.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of those books you just can't put down! I've stayed up till 4 am at times and you can't just stop here you've got to read the rest. Money well spent ;)
B002VWNICW|3.0|P&P has been my favorite book for many years. This version of the film feels like it comes from a well-intentioned reader who was touched by the novel, but only put what he or she remembered into a movie about it. It's sweet, but the dialogue is difficult to understand at times. Austen fans are better off sticking with the BBC version starring Colin Firth.
0316228532|5.0|So I just finished reading The Casual Vacancy and I really enjoy it. I know people are having mixed feelings about the novel but for me it was great read. Rowling knows how to write great story about people who are connected one way or another. Its dark tale about struggle of drug abuse, bullying, and the feeling of being trap in a small town. Its not for everyone. For me this a is great stand alone novel and I can't wait for her next novel.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Very powerful stuff. If you're tired of autotune and want to listen to someone with actual talent, you might want to try this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very fun and addictive.  would work great on larger screen.  not much else to say  that is the game and we are leaving

1475143389|5.0|The Book is just amazing.It doesn't kill you with too many confusing jargons. Everything you need to know and you need to follow,to reach your goals is clearly laid out in the book.I have seen a clear improvement in my lean body mass and strength in the gym by following the training technique that Mike have advised.I used JefitPro(mobile app) as Mike mentioned in the book and clearly track all my workout logs.The insight that Mike gave into nutrition was just amazing.<br />According to me<br />1)Great Info about Nutrition<br />2)Clear Cut dieting and training strategies<br />3)Great Customer Service [Mike actually replies to your e-mails in case you have any troubles]<br />4)A Handbook for Body-building and  Nutrition Info.<br /><br />I came down to 13% Bodyfat from a 22% Bodyfat.Personally I highly recommend the book.If you have any doubts you can mail me at deepuasok1988@gmail.com or asokdeep@ksu.edu.<br /><br />-Deepu Asok
1450419895|5.0|Have two of his books and both are the best I have ever read on Strength training.  Very good display of different muscle groups and how they work and relate to each other.  Excellent book.
B004LVTT8S|4.0|I rented this movie because I was interested in buying a copy, as I have PA 1 and PA 3. I was thrilled to find that it was worthy of purchase, besides, I had to round out my collection.
B008RYN44U|5.0|It was 11 years ago with \\"Rock Steady\\" that I first began to follow and purchase their cds. That was their most commercial or radio friendly album with hit singles including, \\"Hey Baby\\", \\"Underneath it all\\" and \\"Running.\\"<br /><br />For a band that has not recorded for over a decade, I wondered if they could record new material that is relevant and that could compete against the so many new artists who have emerged since...<br /><br />\\"Push and Shove\\" in a nutshell is brilliant! The group's song writing has matured, the lyrics are more poignant and Gwen's voice is as good as its ever been. This release will one day be like \\"Thriller\\" was to Michael Jackson or \\"21\\" to Adele; a defining album that marks the highest success or point in an artist's career. Asides from \\"Settle Down\\", other tracks that instantly feel like major or future hit singles include \\" Looking Hot\\", \\"One More Summer\\", \\"Push and Shove\\" and \\"Heaven\\"<br /><br />Its as if they have never taken any time off. The album feels like what No Doubt should be by now, a great group deserving recognition and a wider world-wide audience.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend the double cd deluxe version for the stripped-down acoustic as well as the club-friendly remixes. This is one of the first cds I've purchased this year that I can play from beginning to end without skipping a track.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|A fine book by any standards but not as good as the first of the trilogy which was really wonderful and was definitely a five star book. Looking forward to the third in the series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't wait to get to the end of this book and move on to more interesting reads.  I have no idea why this book got so much hype.
0307744434|1.0|If you think abstract art is wonderful or are a big fan of Jackson Pollack, you'll love this book.  If, on the other hand, you think all of that is no-talent pretentious crap, you will think the same of this book.  Tantalizing beginning with horrible non-ending. Tries to be deep or arty and really just wastes the reader's time.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have a blast with this game it kills time but isn't so hard to just close it and come back later :)
B004I744AS|5.0|this is so perfect to learn words and its free ive downloaded a dictionary that cost you and it was terrible!!!! this one is awesome i reccomend it to people who love dictionaries but hate searching around in the book!
B004TMPJP6|4.0|In theory, its a 3-star app; in practice, at least for me, its been a 4-star app. I did/do compare it to many other to-do lists and either chose it because it was a better, more simple design, or the other app charged an annual fee, or in very rare cases, the other app wasnt compatible across all my devices (laptop, ipad, and android). Its a little one dimensional for me, but its doing its job. I could really use an app that fuses evernote and a to-do list together (i know i could create my own to do list in evernote, but id rather it actually be a stand-alone function). All in all, its a solid app.

B009IQG5LK|5.0|Seems like it's been forever waiting for the movie on Blu...can't wait as the color usage in this film is gonna just pop on in Hi def.  Would love a modern retrospective of the film but doubt it happening.  Overall great looking, well acted, wonderfully cast movie.  Plus on Al Pacino who was awesome as well as Dustin Hoffman.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm about half way finished with this good story by Stephen King. I had not read anything written by Mr. King in a long time. I'm enjoying this story that takes you back to the late 60's and a walk down memory lane.  Don't want to give away the plot but the book has certainly captured my interest.  I would recommend it!
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Van Helsing(released May/04)stars Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious.This production was sure a roller coaster ride,but not in the good sense.I found it quite uneven,with the two stars playing it right on,with other characters sabotaging their work,thus weakening the whole;down to poor writing.The CGI,as far as creatures go,was also terribly weak.<br />The story opens in Transylvania and Dr Frankenstein is bringing his Monster to life.The castle he works in is owned by Count Dracula and Dracula wants the doctors creation for his own uses.An argument ensues and the good doctor dies.The Monster takes the doctor to the top of a windmill,which is set on fire by the towns people.They end up crashing down through the structure when the floor beneath them gives way.<br />A year later we find Van Helsing in Paris tracking down Mr Hyde.He finds him in a bell tower,struggles with him and ends up killing him.He is summoned to the Vatican,who bankrolls Van Helsings exploits.They reprimand him for failing to bring Mr Hyde back alive.His next job will be bringing the Count down.Van Helsing,along with sidekick Friar Carl,travel to Romania to find the Count.They meet up with Anna,the last member of the Valerious family,who have fought the Count for generations.Just before his arrival Anna's brother had been bitten by a werewolf and was now being used by the Count to bring his vampiric children to life.However it doesn't succeed,so the count looks for the Monster to use.<br />Anna and Van Helsing find the Monster first and spirit him off to the Vatican.Along the way Annas brother attacks the carriage and Van Helsing gets bitten,but not before Van Helsing kills him.Anna is taken captive and Van Helsing must travel to his castle to rescue her.In the attempt,the Monster is captured and taken by the Count to a secret lair.Anna,Van Helsing and the Friar discover a secret portal that takes them directly to the lair.The Monster is rescued but the Counts children are brought successfully to life.Dracula,and a now turned Van Helsing,fight to the finish,with the Count biting the dust.Van Helsing turns on Anna and kills her,but not before she injects him with a serum the Count had to undo the werewolf curse.The Valerious family has now been cleansed and purified.<br />The problem with a movie,especially Sci Fi/fantasy films like this where the suspension of disbelief is paramount,if you don't grab your viewers attention and pull them into your world right off,or cannot get them back somewhere along the line,then you are in trouble.And if your plot is such that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to do exactly,then you are in even bigger trouble.Does this film want to be serious,or is it sending up the monster genre,or is it a light drama with serious overtones,or....?<br />The Count played by Richard Roxburgh,to me was almost played in a send-up kind of style.He seemed to be doing a poor impression of Bela Lugosi,not only speech wise,but his entire body language and look was slightly over the top and unconvincing;about as scary as a box of cereal.Then came the monster of Mr.Hyde.Van Helsing's first encounter is in a bell tower,and the huge Mr Hyde is hanging upside down looking at him.Again,giving off no menacing vibes whatsoever,and the CGI being too obvious and cheap.Then we have the character of Friar Carl.If I hadn't known what movie I was looking at,I would have sworn I was looking at a James Bond film,and this was \\"Q\\".Carl is the equivalent of that Ian Fleming character,showing Van Helsing around the workshop,chock full of hi-tech gadgetry.Carl also becomes a source of the film's lighter moments,with his naive and meek and mild manner.Trouble is,he didn't add to the story,just detracted from it.Then we come to Dracula's children.These things were like small gargoyles and again the CGI again detracted from their menace.Finally we have the Monster.At Dracula's castle,as he is being taken on the table up to the tower,he starts spouting bible passages.I have never seen a more erudite monster,than the one that appears in this film.It's weird and I found it so out of type as to be totally unbelievable.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include bloopers,commentary,two featurettes and a you are in the movie short.<br />All in all a totally disappointing outing for me.The writers had a virtual cornucopia of ideas here to work with,but in the end blew it.Some of the characters were played weakly and went against the film dynamic,the film itself not knowing exactly which way it wanted to go.And it had unconvincing creature CGI effects.Therefore,this picture had no where to go but down for this reviewer.The stars,Beckinsale and Jackman,both played it the way I thought the whole film would be played,but other characters sabotaged it.2 1/2 stars.Not recommended.e starts spouting bible

B005V2S7FW|5.0|I've been using LastPass and LastPass premium for over a year now.  Security is a priority for me and I have so many unique and hard-to-remember passwords in order to follow good security protocol.  However, good security protocol is quite a challenge and it's nearly impossible to remember all the passwords needed without having them written down somewhere or coming up with a password scheme.  Both of those have risks.  If someone finds the written passwords or figures out the scheme, they've got the keys.<br /><br />Passwords generally are a problem.  If it's not hard enough then it's easy to crack, if it's too hard then you can't remember it or it's hard to type in... you end up writing them down.  Now where do you leave the paper?  I had my passwords in an encrypted file, but sometimes I couldn't get to the file or if I had the file I didn't have the tool to decrypt.  :(<br /><br />LastPass offers password generation so making new passwords is a breeze and then stores my passwords in a locked container online.  I'm able to access my passwords from any computer or device.  I have one very strong password and I don't need to worry about the rest.  LastPass offers multifactor options as well.  The price is a no-brainer for the premium service.  Quite frankly I have no idea how LastPass is able to offer it all at such a low price.  Don't tell them I said so, but they should charge much more for a service like this.<br /><br />If you've never tried it, give it a shot.  Once you see how easy it is, you won't want to bother managing your passwords any other way.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I got this album over the weekend, and it has accompanied me on a few hundred miles of driving so far.  At 5am on the road it had me in a great mood.  If you liked the last album you'll enjoy this one just as much.  I've read quite a few reviews saying \\"it sounds the same\\" ... yeah, no kidding ... it sounds great.  Mumford & Sons has a wonderful up-lifting sound that they've held onto THANKFULLY!

B0034DGPEU|5.0|A profound & entrancing read. Heart stopping & gut-wrenching at times...but a story that needed sharing with the world. Highly recommended.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I hardly ever keep mynotes, so this is a good option for my tablet. I really opened up when I found the Chrome app. After that I just copy and paste the webpage and sync it all up. For me, it saves time and formatting.

B0080CL0HM|4.0|I read Bel Ami long before the movie came out and they could not have better casting.  The actors / actresses were fantastic.  I thought the movie was great.
0756407125|5.0|I really can't say what exactly it is I like about this book. Maybe it's the same thing I liked about the TV series: Lost -- all the interesting characters. Something about the personal story. It's like a fictional autobiography. This trilogy captures you with it's characters.
B007EJ6S92|5.0|This album is excellent. The speed with which I received this order was superb. Thank you very much. I run a metal-based radio show and this album has served me well.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Good read and typical Reacher form, but the ending was strange.  Almost like Mr. Child concluded that - gee, I have enough pages written so let's just end this thing.  And so he did.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Great Movie...loved it! It was a little shiney for me but other than that it was a good avengers tale.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very enjoyable reading and has well developed, lovable characters.  These books kept my interest and while some might find it graphic in parts, I thought it was tastefully done.  I highly recommend it!!
0307877965|5.0|I just discovered Mankell and have started to go through all his books. His writing style is relaxing. There is limited action but excellent character development. In the style of James Lee Burke, he paints a great picture. Be careful in buying your first Mankell book because you'll become hooked.
B001H1SW4M|5.0|This movie is a classic horror movie because it has a lot of blood, suspense, sick and nasty stuff.<br />But it is so creative too because dang, all the clues that have been showed throughout the movie have something to do with the KILLER, yet, it is hard to find out who is him. At the end of the movie, every single clue comes alive and We understand everything, which is why this has creativity, it is simple, the acting is great IMO, DR. Gordon is one of the best actors.<br />This is one of my top favorites for sure along with the A nightmare on Elm Street Series, and The Omen Series.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|always loved this game at the Tilt.  glad to see this brought back.  gives hours of fun and definitely love that it is free.
B007RD4KQ8|4.0|This album is rare opportunity to experience collaborations from several artists that came together around the black sabbath - deep purple (Iommi-Gillan) body of work. Even the late Dio is depicted in  a Deep Purple song. This a must for the Sabbath / Purple fans !

It takes about an hour to charge out of the box. Feel free to ask questions, and I hope this review helps you in your buying decision.
B007THA4FI|1.0|WOULD LOVE TO READ HER ADULT WORKS, BUT NOT FOR 17.99  REALLY??<br />IT'S AN  E BOOK  NOT SOMETHING FOR THE BOOK CASE, SHE REALLY LIKES HER STUFF, RIGHT UP THERE WITH CHARLAINE HARRIS'S PRICES
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this daily. What I really like is that I can set it up to remind me of regular things on a WEEKLY basis, not just for individual hours. Another thing I like is that it will wake the Kindle so I can use it as an alarm clock. Snooze times can be varied, sounds can be varied, alarm volumes can even be set to crescendo over time.<br /><br />As for those who talk about the app using up all their power, I think they have other problems. I can use my Kindle Fire for 9 hours without a recharge, doing other things, with WiFi on, with the clock app in the background. No problem!
B008KNUKVI|5.0|There voices are just incredible. SUBLIME HARMONIES!!!!!!!! They were meant to sing together, and the original songs are SO GREAT!
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app used to be amazing I could download any song to my kindle fire, now I cant download any which is upsetting from such a great app.
B000SFD21Q|5.0|This book is an engaging and entertaining example of infotainment. You read interesting stories and examples that are weaved together to tell a greater story: the relationship between physical activity, health and mental function. You will learn the why's that exemplify all of the positive things physical activity does to your body and mind.<br /><br />Revelation after revelation, this book is a wealth spring of liberating knowledge that will inspire you to become or stay active. The author's voice is sincere and dynamic. His examples are numerous and well based in both the sciences and the real world. I have recommended this book to dozens of people!<br /><br />This book is a liberating and inspiring source of life transforming knowledge! I thoroughly enjoyed reading every word of it!
1476712042|3.0|Beautiful Disaster<br /><br />By: Jamie McGuire<br /><br />Genre: Seriously messed-up dysfunctional YA romance<br /><br />Rating: R (for bedroom scenes and language)<br /><br />Coffee Beans: 3.5/5<br /><br />Spoilers: Nothing major<br /><br />Favorite Line: \\"It looks like Vegas threw up on a flock of vultures,\\" America sneered.<br /><br />Warning: This is going to be long, but I promise you, it will be interesting and entertaining to make the ride smooth. Also, I will not be commenting on the technical side of the book (writing, etc), I will only be commenting on the story itself. Point 3, this is, 100% a guilty pleasure review, because that's the only way I could review this book.<br /><br />Publisher's Review<br /><br />The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn't drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University's Walking One-Night Stand.<br /><br />Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby wants--and needs--to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby's resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis's apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.<br /><br />From me<br /><br />I'm learning my lesson this time around and writing my review as I go. Mainly because with this book, there's a lot I want to say and I don't want to forget any of it.<br /><br />I started this book at 7pm last night, read to 11 (past my bedtime) and then sat in my car before work and read as much as I could there, too. Repeat the process for lunch, add in reading under my desk and then in the car on the ride home. This book is addicting, and pulls you through with such force, you're bound to get whiplash.<br /><br />But that in no way means that this is a \\"good\\" book.<br /><br />It just means I couldn't put it down. And based on a lot of the reviews out there, that's how the majority of the readers felt, too; no matter how slight.<br /><br />Guilty Pleasure Review<br /><br />I'm probably going to offend a lot of people out there with this next statement, but here we go!<br /><br />Any woman who says, that deep down, she doesn't have some sort of fantasy of or desire for (on any level), a man to be an Alpha Male around her is lying to herself. Girl Power is all over the place (yay, I support that! I'm all for strong women and doing things for ourselves, etc), but deep down, I think it's a primal instinct of our gender that we want to have the big, strong, burly, somewhat aggressive/protective/dominant male to single us out, find us attractive, and then defend us against any other encroaching male. It's also a strange (and somewhat stupid, IMO) desire to find the broken man and be able to \\"fix\\" or \\"change\\" him because we're that special or he loves us that much.<br /><br />That being said, I want to make it clear that I don't think that that's what this book does. AT ALL. I think this book supports more of an abusive, co-dependent, dysfunctional relationship. But that's obvious, so I'm not going to talk about it anymore than that.<br /><br />Continuing.<br /><br />As I was saying, it's not that this book is particularly well written or has a very strong plot. The female is a worse flip-flopper than Kerry during the 2008 presidential election and weak, but for some blasted reason, I couldn't put the book down, and when I wasn't reading it, all I thought about was picking it up to read it some more. I think the reason is this: That's a pretty dangerous/exciting/thrilling life to be living vicariously through Abby. Admit it. Goingback to your early college years. The partying, the hooking up, the careless fun with no consequences or responsibility....Psychopathic boyfriend with anger and obsession issues.....Oh, wait...<br /><br />Moving on.<br /><br />On a safe, light level, this is probably a life that some women secretly long for or wish they could go back to. And this entire book was one fustercluck of a dysfunctional, twisted train wreck that you couldn't pass by without slowing down to gape at.<br /><br />You all know how I feel about books being written glorifying this type of relationship, so I'm not going to get up on my soapbox...much. Instead, let's break down what's going on here, in a somewhat light-hearted manner.<br /><br />The Setting<br /><br />Okay, really, what college has a cafeteria and an hour lunch period devoted strictly to eating? Any hands? Bueller? That's right...none. That I know of. I got the distinct impression that this was supposed to be/originally written in a high school setting. Here's how I pictured the author's original scenario playing out:<br /><br />  Two girls in high school, maybe a private away-from-home school. America falls for an older guy from the nearby college. Abby follows suit with the guy's cousin. (It would explain why the girls are living in the dorms and the guys are living in an apartment instead of in dorms or in the frat house, like they should be. Which is also why they have lunch hours - to develop the Travis-Abby relationship dynamic and the Travis-gets-to-pummel-the-football-team opportunities.)<br /><br />  But wait! If I have it set in high school, then I can't really have the content in the book that I want to (because, let's face it, even though \\"anything goes\\" in YA, there are some decency limits). And, it'd be weird to be publicly talking about and okaying the fact that they're sneaking off to their college boyfriend's apartments and doing the unmentionable (Mare, at least).<br /><br />  So I'll make it college. Voila! Everything is fixed and now it's okay that they're dating older guys and there are underground fight circles and I can push the limits EVEN MORE!<br /><br />  The end.<br /><br />I'm sure it didn't go exactly like that, but probably pretty close.<br /><br />The Best Friend Factor<br /><br />America sucks as a best friend. I'm putting that out there now. She encourages Abby to like Travis. Then tries to protect her from Travis because he's \\"scary\\" and \\"dangerous\\".  Then she doesn't really give any merit to what's happening in her best friend's relationship. BUT, when her boyfriend, Shepley, makes some stupid wrong decision, the world is ending and she breaks up with him. Multiple times.<br /><br />And what's up with Shep? Always warning Abby to be patient with Travis and to overlook the \\"mistakes\\" he's going to make. Uh, okay...is that what they're calling psychotic-jealousy-induced-violent tantrums now a days? Mistakes?<br /><br />Then there's the scene where Abby ends up leaving in the middle of the night. Travis wakes up and freaks out. Tearing down drapes, throwing stereos, punching mirrors, ripping doors from hinges, etc. America actually has the nerve to call Abby and tell her what's going on, confess that she's really scared of Travis right now, and then tell Abby that she has to come back.<br /><br />What the heck?????<br /><br />(Let's face it, reality is seriously skewed in this book, which is why I can't really give it a serious review)<br /><br />Abusive relationships<br /><br />Yes, there is more than one. For instance, with me. I felt like I was in an abusive relationship with this book. At first, it's fine. I like the storyline, I like the characters. The book is nice to me. The extreme fantasy of this situation playing out the way it was was okay.<br /><br />Then, little things started happening. The wrong reaction from Travis, the wrong decision from Abby. The flippant attitude of everyone involved when disturbing things start happening. But then, everything goes back to how it was in the beginning, normal. Gifts were exchanged, smiles flashed, compliments given. It's all good, right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />I didn't want to read. What I was reading was wrong. But I was promised everything would get better. And I had to know what was going on. So I read on. Which is the whole point, and the cycle starts again.<br /><br />Even though there wasn't any physical abuse going on between Abby and Travis, there was certainly some mental and psychological abuse present. From the outside, this was definitely a relationship that shouldn't have been explored. But I can also understand how it may not have been so obvious for Abby. But, there's no excuse for Mare and Shep not to have stepped in with the red flags.<br /><br />Abby<br /><br />Oh, crazy, emotional, dysfunctional, blind, inconsistent, Abby. Okay, so I understand why she took the bet and held to it. I mean, she just out of high school and not all that mature. I'm sure that if a lot of girls were in her position, and Travis was a guy they were interested in (because, let's face it, she was lying when she said she wasn't interested), they'd totally lose that bet on purpose and claim integrity and honor by fulfilling it. So, for a few people out there, it's a realistic set up. Sometimes I think Abby's smart, seeing that Travis is not a wise choice for a boyfriend, and then she surprises me and turns dumb again, ignoring her previous decision.<br /><br />Lame \\"Secret\\"<br /><br />That's right, I've called you out, \\"mysterious reason as to why Abby doesn't want to get close to Travis\\". L-A-M-E. I mean, it could've been good, if it were executed better, given more weight, and showed up more throughout the story except for where it was convenient to move the plot forward or explain some back-assward reasoning for Abby's actions.<br /><br />Nicknames<br /><br />Everyone and their dog has a nickname! For the love of Pete, can't we just call `em by their names?? Pigeon/Pidge/Abs = Abby; Mare = America; Shep = Shepley; Trav = Travis. Pigeon kind of annoyed me at first, but then it grew on me.<br /><br />Addictiveness<br /><br />I'll admit, I thought this was a completely different book when I started reading it and was a bit confused when I saw it on an end cap in B&N next to 50 Shades and Ann Rice's old books. (I thought I was starting the YA book Love & Other Perishable Items, the covers are so freaking similar. It's not my fault).<br /><br />But the more I read, the more addictive it became. And I couldn't put it down. I stayed up past my bedtime the first night. Sat in the parking lot before work to read. Read on my lunch. Read under my desk. And went to read after work at Sbux, BUT MY NOOK BATTERY DIED!! So yes, this plot is strong enough and fast enough to pull you through the unbelievable crap that's between the covers (and not the bed sheets kind).<br /><br />I loved this guy's review and in particular, this snippet:<br /><br />\\"Anyhoo, with all this rambling it may seem like I hated this book. Not at all! Much like a junkie getting kicked out of rehab for shooting up the smack he smuggled in his anus, I continually keep coming back to these type of stories! It's a love/hate relationship! I just want to see how the story is going to end...even though I sort of already do.\\"<br /><br />For me, that's the perfect description.<br /><br />The Ending<br /><br />It sucked. I'm not saying anything else, except: It was a little too cookie cutter of an HEA. I think there should have been a bit more dysfunction in the end. Like maybe a murder (Travis has it in him) or a mob contract, or something equally as interesting (Joking, but only slightly).<br /><br />There's Another One<br /><br />And you can bet your bottom dollar that I'm gonna read it. It's gonna be told from Trav's POV so we'll understand why he acted like he did and all fall in love with him. Awwww! (Every time Travis is in a scene, the song Smooth Operater comes to mind...)<br /><br />My friend, Tiff, described it as a \\"train wreck of a romance\\" and I couldn't agree more. There are two times when the characters describe the truth of the relationship. Abby says, \\"We are dysfunctional, Travis.\\"(amen) and then Shep tells Abby that when her and Travis are happy everything's rainbows and butterflies but when they're not, it's like a tornado is destroying the world.<br /><br />I think Beautiful Disaster is the perfect mash-up of Fight Club and some outrageous Lifetime Original Movie. In fact, I totally envisioned this as a movie and the success it would have if ever put into one, from the first scene at the Circle. Come to find out, it's going to be made into one sometime in the future.<br />In the end, I think this book--as much as some people don't want to admit it--is believable and a reality to a lot of girls out there. So deal, even if you don't like it or agree. Overall, I liked it for the mindless, emotional abuse of a ride that it was.<br /><br />Happy reading!hing goes back to how it was in the beginning, normal.

B0052RE4MQ|3.0|i honestly loved matched but i got my hopes way up i read about 100  pages bur i skipt Ton  i reached a part where the two found each other.i got really mad that it wasnt going on how i had hoped for.. so i stop reading it. now i wish  i had finished it.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|The Wrath of the Titans was a movie I didn't like that much. There where some special effects that were enteresting enough. The movie didn't have the the interesting factor. That's were the movie is not good enough to keep my attention most of the time. I found my self wandering off. All in all it was passable movie.[[ASIN:B008EQIEWS Wrath of the Titans]]
B0043URV5U|5.0|I really enjoyed the album. It gives a good review of the works of Bob Seger. I have an LP that I bought years ago, but this is a positive item to my collection.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I was on the verge of returning this headset when anywhere from 10-15 minutes into a game the audio would cut out completely, even when hooked up directly via USB, and require a restart of the game to regain sound.<br /><br />In the end, the issue was traced down to the fact that my G13, G15 and G930 were on the same USB Bus. Moving the G930's to a different USB Bus, as in the front facing USB ports as opposed to the rear USB ports on the motherboard, resolved the issue.<br /><br />So the headset works great as long as the G13&G15 aren't on the same bus. I can move the keyboard to the front and the headphones to the rear, but not the same bus.<br /><br />It's an odd issue that Logitech needs to work out, I'm not the only one having this exact problem - the solution was posted on their forums where other members described my exact issue. So far Logitech has been claiming that it's an issue with Borderlands 2 or Guild Wars 2 or whatever. Logitech has always had a tough time putting out quality drivers and this is time is no different.<br /><br />So the software is iffy at best and thus the -2 stars.<br /><br />Hardware though is outstanding. I have no complaints about the sound quality, the comfort or the range of this headset. No it won't beat out a $300 pair of wired headphones when it comes to sound reporduction - but it shines as a gaming headset.<br /><br />Finally, before the comments saying my issues were caused by my hardware/software and not Logitech's poor drivers:<br />The PC was built Friday, clean install of Win7, brand new Asus Sabertooth Z77, clean install of chipset drivers, Logitech drivers etc. The PC was as pristine as it gets with no odd non standard hardware or configuration. The issue only appears when G13, G15 and G930 are plugged into the same USB bus. If I use a different brand USB keyboard or leave the G13 unplugged, there are no issues. It seems that Logitech needs to test that all their fancy hardware plays well together.

B0087HT36U|5.0|I had this game installed on an ASUS Transformer Prime TF201 and it was one of my favorite apps.  It's similar in nature to \\"Angry Birds\\", but I think it's much better than \\"Angry Birds\\".  Many of the levels were quite challenging and I had to play some of them many times before finding the optimal approach to their solutions.<br /><br />A week or two ago, ASUS pushed an upgrade from Ice Cream Sandwich to Jelly Bean (Android 4.1) and, unfortunately, this game stopped working.  I uninstalled/reinstalled it, but that didn't help.  I give this game five stars despite the fact it no longer works because I found it so much fun.  I hope the authors update it so that it works again.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Good action packed movie ,well worth watching great special effects has a different twist to the ending that was different from the fairy tale.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I wish I could say it was my busy schedule that kept me from reading this series after countless recommendations but I honestly think it was my assumption that the current popular fiction adored by the masses is a waste of my time and money.  I've never been more happy to tell my friends, and anyone else who wants to listen, that I'm glad I caved in and that I was completely and utterly wrong.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I lost myself in a series like I did the Hunger Games; it was like once I started I couldn't stop until I knew the fate of Katniss and the rest of Panem.  I don't believe I'm a very emotional person but it seemed with each new revelation or novel end I found myself having visceral reactions. Fear, loss, oppression, rebellion, selfishness, selflessness, brokenness, hatred, destruction, redemption, grace, love, humor, injustice, family--it will rock you reach you at your deepest level if you allow it.  And I definitely recommend it just for the cathartic release it brings.
0345803485|1.0|Wow...disgusting dialogue. Demeans women. Story about two low lives (morally).  Waste of time. This should be listed under \\"Fantasy or Sience Fiction\\" category.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|The Broadway show was an amazing classic! But Fosse's choreography just wouldn't make it in a movie. This version preserves the score perfectly and visually creates the same atmosphere and emotion as the stage version using techniques unique to film.  One of the few movies I have bothered watching more than once!  This was my third viewing and I can definitely see myself watching it again in a few years. Hummed the songs for days afterwards!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|This is a great book, once I started reading couldn't stop till I finished with it.<br /><br />Can't wait till day 3 appears!
B008H6GHL0|5.0|Resident Evil Damnation is a definite upgrade from its previous CGI movie, [[ASIN:B001I9XOQO Resident Evil: Degeneration]] in terms of CGI, action and story. While the story is slightly convoluted, but in total RE style--I mean, just think of the thin plot/story from RE4 accompanied with the wild action and you have this movie.  The gist is that Leon S. Kennedy is in the \\"East Slavic Republic\\" to investigate Bio-Organic Weapons (BOW's) but was told to abort that mission and return to America, trusty Hunnigan reporting that news of course. Leon, ever disobeying orders, continues, and discovers how dirty (and hand to hand combat skilled) the current President is. There are other points in the plot, but don't want to spoil it. I will be rewatching it again for sure.<br /><br />I loved this! I really did. First, I think Leon fans will be beaming. I know I was. I can NEVER get enough Leon. He's cool, sexy, witty, sarcastic, mad skilled and passionate about the truth, and his country (not so much the government) Anyway, Leon is just so great, always with a one-liner even when giant lab created monsters are chasing him--and he's not afraid to die. I love him.<br /><br />In some parts the story may get a tad boring, BUT not for long and there are interesting and very likable characters. Not to mention plenty of action. And Ada! I would have liked more moments between these two. I would love to see a couple scenes where their obvious attraction for each other got a bit out of hand, or just an intimate moment between them. It was great in RE4, would love have seen it carried over. Ada does not save Leon for nothing, especially if she's working for Wesker.<br /><br />The CGI is amazing and smooth, sound is awesome. The only thing that could have made it better was actual motion capture so we could see better lip-syncing but that is minor. People are raving about monster. Well, there are a lot of them--but mostly the same ones over and over. Nevertheless, as a long time RE fanit's always wonderful to see things from the past or even recent past. Lickers are front and center and the fact that they can now be controlled is very interesting and a bit odd in a way, as you can't believe you find yourself rooting for them and even feeling sorry they died. Lickers are on our side now!<br /><br />The last battled with Leon and his somewhat all, Buddy is frakkin' epic and worth watching again. There aren't a lot of regular zombies, but we make up for it with lickers.<br /><br />I would love to see yet another CGI movie with events from RE6. Umbrella and the government will never stop, and there are always stories to tell. Leon is a clear fan fav and I hope Capcom remembers that. NEVER KILL LEON!! I hope they are listening.<br /><br />This movie came right on time to get you even more amped for RE6. I want both. This is one of my fav game series, and I'm so happy I've followed it throughout the years. S.T.A.R.S members feel like old friends. Now, to get Leon and Ada together.....
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|IMO, Marvel's The Avengers is the best comic book movie to date. The reason I say this is that Joss Whedon knows how to direct an ensemble and he respects the source material. All the characters are true to their comic book counter parts. The only blemish would be Hawkeye who was obviously placed on the backburner because of the large cast. Joss speaks to a bit of that on the commentary for the dvd. The movie looks great and sounds great. My only wish would have been for a team commentary on the disc. It's nice to get an idea of what the actors thought about a particular scene. The drawback for the bluray would be the stacking of disc. I solved it by putting the 3d and regular bluray disc in the case. The dvd and digital disc (once used) don't have to be in case. Also, the digital disc is such a chore to download. I hate having to jump through so many hoops to get material I paid for. But once it's all downloaded, you are good to go. Just a great buy. Loved it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'd be willing to bet money that the author first watched 9 1/2 Weeks, then Pretty Woman then Twilight and then decided to sit down to write a novel.<br /><br />There was so much hype about this book that I wanted to read it.  The only reason I couldn't put down because I just wanted to find out how it ended.  Overall, it was disappointing, not particularly shocking or erotic, had shallow character development and the feel of a Young Adult book.  I think other reviewers who posted statistics about the repetition were just being kind, because it felt like the numbers were much higher.<br /><br />Maybe the only good from this book is that the Erotica genre will be more accepted by the mainstream.  I guess the bad is that it might give others the idea that anyone can write it, particularly E.L. James.

I thought I'd never wear these things but once I tried them on, I was hooked!  The classic ones are comfortable, but  duet sport one are wonderful!  My feet are happy at last.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I had to read the final book of this series and I wasn't dissapointed it was great.  I enjoyed the whole series and the end was good.  I know you will also want to finish and not wait till it is a movie.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|This film is ok. I am not big on the whole Hunger Games. I am on Catching Fire. This film excedes my blu ray expectations. The blu ray itself is great with fenominal bonus material. The film is ok but not great. A great cast with awesome performances. Watch this film but don't expect it to be better than the book.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|If you enjoy hidden object games you'll really like this one. It was fun and you want to keep playing to get to the solution.  Hopefully the second part comes out soon!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The best superhero movie of the year is now on blu ray. Everyone's seen this film. I would suspect that the reactions were generally very positive as to coincide with record breaking performances at the box office. I picked up this blu ray. I didn't like the packaging, but the content was awesome. Seeing this film again on blu ray makes me feel like sitting in the theater for the first viewing of this film. There were funny parts which would result in applause from the audience and laughter when the hulk vs. loki scene was played. The bonus content is wonderful considering how fast the film was brought to home entertainment viewing. This is one of the best films of the year aside from HG and TDNR. A well worth purchase to anyone who wants to have fun and enjoy themselves in a fictional good vs. bad world. If you haven't seen it, well, then you've missed out my friend. Do yourself a favor. WATCH THIS FILM, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!

B007GCY8FS|3.0|The last few books about jack reacher makes me think that te entire central art of the US is filled with people who make the Manson family run with terror. It seems like he moves from one trouble spot to the next and never finds anything normal.  The books are skidding into almost a seral like one would have watched in the movies in the 30's, hero comes into town, beats up bad guys and rides off into the sunset.  A little more depth other stories and perhaps the introduction or bringing back of secondary characters  to help, rathe than Reacher save the world once again. That being said I do enjoy te books, I will buy te next one and hopefully like it more. Each one is a good read and is well written. I am somewhat disappointed to hear that Tom Cruise is going to play him in the upcoming movie, what were they thinking? Reacher is big man, 6 ' 5\\" and Tom Cruise may be great actor, but that's a stretch on the character described in the books. Look at Lian Neson in the movie \\"Taken\\" he's big and probably the baddest man on the planet if you watch the movie, now that's a character I can believe in

I've had these notebooks for the past 3 years and they have always been great. The layout fits well with my needs and I like that one side is a full lined notes page so that I can jot down daily notes. Will definitely purchase more in the future!

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I downloaded this to see what all the craze was about not having played any version of Angry birds.<br />It works I did a number of levels and now am stuck and not trying hard.<br />It gave me what I wanted, a chance to see the game.

0307888908|2.0|The Start-Up of You, written by self proclaimed networking experts Ried Hoffman and Ben Casnocha, is one of many books geared toward new college graduates and career beginners.  Despite its appealing cover and famous authors, it completely fails to stand out, and at over 2oo pages the book is about 4 times as long as it needs to be for its information content.  Filled with dozens of exciting and inspiring career stories that don't relate to you in any way, the book itself quickly becomes tedious and uninspired.<br /><br />  The authors are happy to mention the 100 million professionals are on their social networking website.  What they fail to mention is how many millions made a Lined-In page in a bored moment while between jobs and never looked at it again.  Similarly, I suspect many who purchased this book read the first chapter, and then promptly forgot it existed.<br /><br />  If you are looking for inspiration or guidance in your career planning, you can certainly do better.
B005MJFA2W|4.0|This is a very mentally stimulating book but it is also a very challenging book to read. Given the content and the though provoking concepts that it raises I really think that it is not designed for the casual read. You really need to set aside the time, concentrate and ingest what it has to offer.<br /><br />It is a book that illustrates how we think. It is a book that demonstrates that the way we think can be manipulated and that is what makes it so fascinating.  To really get the most from the book you probably need to view it more as a textbook than a piece of non-fiction. Likewise, in many ways it a book that is probably going to give you the same stimulation no matter how many times you read it.<br /><br />I will admit that I did find it somewhat distracting that the author keeps mentioning themselves and their work in the book and that does make it a little harder to read. However, at its core this a great book for anyone who is interested in understanding the way that we think and how our thought processes can be manipulated by such simple things.<br /><br />We consider ourselves so sophisticated in these days of the information age, yet as this book illustrates our brains response in a very consistent way. Reading this book will help you understand these ways and hopefully be more aware of when such automatic responses kick in. However, be sure to set aside the time to study rather than read this book to get the most from it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A captivating story over a few pages with characters you can really get invested in. The author writes in prose that is both interesting and easy to follow. I will continue to read more of his works. I am glad I bought all five in this download instead of one at a Time. I will be downloading the next one - the prequel soon enough!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This film combines great action, great bits of comedy to break the tension but yet still not so much that it detracts from the main theme. I suggest watching Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger if you want to full enjoy the movie. All three movies are connected together.<br />A++
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series and have read the books again and again, wondering at JK Rowling's ability to create a world so real and appealing that readers want to live there, and to create stories that are so compelling they become a part of a reader. Sadly, this book did not come close to either of those experiences. As any Harry Potter reader knows, character development is not one of Rowling's strengths, and this is the fatal flaw of the book. The teenage characters are more finely wrought than the adults (as was true for the Harry Potter series) and there are a few of these teenagers who are engaging. I wish Rowling had either focused on the teenagers' stories more or developed the adult characters. The plot is mildly interesting and kept me reading through 2/3 of the book, but at that point, the fact that I did not care enough about the characters to continue reading overcame any vested interest I had in the story line. Finishing the book was a chore, and I found the ending to be wholly unsatisfactory. I hate when authors kill off characters because they cannot figure out what should happen next, it is an insult to the readers. If Rowling had spent some time developing some of the adult characters - there are two women in particular who could have carried the book - this might have been more successful. Alternately, instead of starting the book with the death of a man who appeared throughout the tale to be one of the few with any morals, Rowling could have started with his story and had him die later, which would have created an interesting pivotal point in the plot and tension in the story.<br /><br />Certainly, the writing is very good; there are no issues with poor grammar and spelling as seen in far too many contemporary books. And Rowling's ability to create a fully formed world (the small village in which most of the story is set) is clearly apparent. Those really are the only positives about this novel.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never read anything like it.  The world unfolds so gradually through the books there are many \\"aha\\" moments.  There are a number of mysteries, a lot of tension, some melancholy and hope for the characters.  This book held me on every level.  (Omnibus edition)  I am thrilled to see Number 6 available.  I love to read, fairly discriminating, and I would recommend WOOL for everyone.

B008JDAC7G|5.0|When first seeing this game I wasn't expecting much. How could a match-3 game with a single column offer any depth? I shouldn't have doubted the team at Adult Swim Games. The game rewards planning ahead your use of monster abilities, throws special blocks into the mix yo challenge and reward and coats it in an over-the-top presentation you could only get from Adult Swim. A great fit for the Kindle Fire. I only wish they had a separate page for tracking multiple high scores and the achievement system.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|I have had this mouse for a year now and its really been worn in during. I have come along only one problem with the mouse after all that time.<br /><br />Lets start with the Pro's of this mouse.<br />Pro's:<br />-The programmable keys<br />-Up to 4000 DPI<br />-Twin Laser (more accuracy)<br />-Hybrid palm shape<br /><br />Cons:<br />-One of my buttons has sort of partially dislodged itself from the base of the mouse<br />-Inferno Software (kind of a con)<br /><br />You are getting a lot of mouse in this for the price here. 9 programmable keys with the ability to create 3 profiles is definitely a plus  for someone looking for a solid gaming mouse. In Battlefield 3 this mouse has become invaluable because I have mapped most of the keys (knife, grenade, reload, etc) to the mouse. I haven't really had the change to use the storm tactics key, mostly because I don't see when I could possibly use the key. This is where the Inferno software comes in. For people who are just getting into PC gaming this mouse is a great deal, but the software is gonna take some getting used to. A previous reviewer mentioned lack of support by the community and he is correct. There are not a whole lot of forums talking about this mouse or sharing profiles. If there were that would be fantastic because the software has the ability to import and export profiles. The software does take a little getting used to but once everything is setup the way you want you shouldn't have to mess with it too much because the settings will be stored directly in the mouses memory. Moving on to the hybrid palm shape. I put this in pro mostly because I like the way its shaped. I tend to palm the whole mouse during games and it fits perfectly. I also claw the mouse sometimes and it feels it equally comfortable. The reason Cooler Master calls it a hybrid on its website is because you can do both of these things.<br /><br />The one con that I listed might just be a problem for me. The mouse did not come this way, but it occurred later on. I tend to take the mouse with me and it might have become damaged due to me moving it around with me. Other reviewers have not had this problem so I figured it was just me. Overall, its a great product.it occurred later on.

B0031RDV0A|5.0|The author clarified many misunderstandings about evolution theory. Interesting evidence from the fossil records and how the scientists obtained them and their ages and several living evidence of evolution.<br /><br />The author also pointed out the problem of creationism idea that still propagated among almost half of the population and its attempts to bar evolution study in school curriculum.<br /><br />IMO, there are many other ways to get a hand on knowledge not just in the school system. If we can make the knowledge free, accessible and, of course, interesting; we can attract ones who want to know more. By creating the competitive system, the evolutionists said, the fittest for the environment and competition will survive.<br /><br />Let's popularize the science by evolution of human learning!

0316228532|1.0|I was interested in reading what JKR had to say as an adult novelist - my kids grew up along with Harry Potter, and although I loved those books, I thought that a writer of her prodigious talent would probably be able to pull off a non-Potter adult novel with ease.<br /><br />I was so wrong. Dear God, was I wrong.<br /><br />The novel began with a sharp step off the curb and never regained its footing, staggering on through hundreds of pages of misery, not just for the characters in the book, but also for the eager reader, whose enthusiasm hit rock bottom at about page 100. I only persevered because my mama taught me not to be a quitter.<br /><br />It's hard to know where to begin, but it's probably best to start with the many, many characters (the plot doesn't matter - it was as dull as a bowl of oatmeal), not a single one of whom is admirable or even slightly likeable. It's not just that they're flawed, because who wants to read a book about perfect, adorable people who always do and say perfect, adorable things? (If that's the sort of novel you like to read, I'd like to point you toward Jan Karon's gooey Mitford series.) No, this novel doesn't have one single sympathetic character: You pretty much hate them all from first to last. The only way to distinguish among them is that some are worse than others. It's as if Rowling said, \\"I want to write an adult novel with adult themes, so how's about I throw in some pedophilia? AND some mental illness? AND a rapist? AND a sadistic, revolting teenager or two? AND some adultery? AND a crack whore? AND a self-mutilator? AND an abusive husband/father? AND wives who are hatefully contemptuous of their husbands? AND some husbands who act more like children than men? AND about a thousand f-bombs? AND some ugly sex? AND...AND...AND...\\"<br /><br />Do you get my point? This dystopian novel contains barely a shred of kindness, mercy, selflessness, family solidarity or, I don't know, LOVE. Everyone is locked into miserable relationships, everyone is suffering, everyone is mean, everyone is selfish. This was probably the most depressing book I've ever read and if Rowling thought the sad, anti-climactic ending there at the church with the pink coffin and the little, tiny white coffin in any way shone the light of redemption on the previous four hundred and some pages, she was sadly mistaken. This book was horrible. After a while, it went from being disturbing to just being ludicrous; does any novel have a larger cast of characters, none of whom have any depth other than loathsomeness of one kind or another? It's one of those novels that I wouldn't even want to donate to Goodwill - why would I want to inflict this awful story on anyone else?<br /><br />Oh, for one multi-faceted Severus Snape, with his venomous tongue and his doe Patronus! Oh, for a many-layered Dumbledore with his upright heart and his murky past! Why do the kids get all the fabulously-drawn characters with their wrongs and their rights, their petty hatreds and their monumental graces, and we adults get landed with a novel full of nothing but Dursleys?<br /><br />This novel was a major disappointment. My recommendation, if you feel you absolutely must read it, is to borrow it from your public library. Do not spend the money on this one.<br /><br />Edited to add: My continuing thought on this book is that Joanne Rowling definitely has a voice as a writer, it's just that, with this novel as an example, I don't think her voice is one for adults. Maybe her true niche is writing outstanding young adult fiction - heaven knows the world could use more solid writing in that genre, and there's certainly no shame in writing books that entertain, instruct and enlighten the YA crowd, which is exactly what she did with the Potter series. I am hoping that The Casual Vacancy is just an aberration, a hiccup in her career, because this book doesn't even seem like *her.* JK Rowling is an author who knows how to flawlessly develop a character. She's brilliant at it. She's better than this book, SO much better. The second piece of advice I have to add to this review is that if you haven't read the Harry Potter series, go do it right now and see what this talented woman is truly capable of. Read Harry Potter with your adult sensibilities, not just allowing the plot line engross you, but also to observe the manner in which the imperfect characters grow into grace with their strengths, weaknesses, failures and triumphs. It should be an able antidote if you read The Casual Vacancy.'s brilliant at it. She's better than this book, SO much better.

B0036S4C6G|5.0|I read the description of this, and thought it'd make for an interesting concept. I began reading it at 10pm, and stayed up well into the night as I had to finish it. I absolutely LOVE the various points of view, yet how they are all interrelated. This takes place in an era before my time as I was an 80's baby, but somehow still felt myself able to relate to the nostalgia. That's how well Egan pulls readers in. Nothing is as it seems, and nothing turns out how you might imagine. Read it. It's profound. Will the book change your life? Probably not. But, the power of relationships and the choices we make undoubtedly will.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Pines was my Kindle Online Lending Library choice for September.<br /><br />I liked it. The completely unexpected swerve into the future is incredible. That future is fantastically contradictory, simultaneously peaceful and horrific.<br /><br />Pines is extremely well written. The characters complete, flawed, believable, (loved the evil nurse Pam - reminded me of nurse Ratched in \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\").<br /><br />The narrative descriptions are adequate, not overdone. Visualization is easy. The Pines' action scenes got my heart thumping. I was involved in the story, rooting for Ethan and Theresa all the way.<br /><br />Needless to say, I have a new author to follow. I've already purchased two of his other works.<br /><br />There was a little bit of coarse language. I don't recall any sexual content. Obviously, there is graphic violence.<br /><br />I recommend Pines and rate it easily 4 stars.
0062060554|2.0|I couldn't wait to read this novel. Sadly, it was unbelievably boring. Interesting concept, however the characters were flat, scenes were flat, and overall the story was flat.

You want a recommendation? [[ASIN:1400081882 Improv Wisdom: Don't Prepare, Just Show Up]]
B006LSZECO|5.0|At first, I did not have any interest in reading this. I thought it was going to be cheesy. I just got married in March, and after a year of wedding planning- I didn't care to read any cheesy love story. Obviously, I had never read this author before! Love store it is not. It is a dark, twisted, keep you on the edge of your seat thriller. It's been a long time since I've encountered a novel where there are so many depths to a character you don't know who or what to believe. That's the experience each of the characters gave. You're seeing the story through their eyes, and the author does a great job of showing how point of view can really change perspectives. There were SO many twists in this novel. I actually LOVED the ending. It was an UNEXPECTED twist. For the reviews that stated she didn't know how to end the novel, so she made it a twist, which disappointed them- I wonder if she hadn't thrown that twist in there would you instead be complaining it was \\"predictable?\\" Predictable it was not. I LOVED this novel, finished it in two sittings, and will certainly venture out to read more of her work.
1439127700|5.0|When one reads a book about recent presidents or politics, one can expect there to be a certain bias.  This is natural from any author.  After reading over 500 pages on the presidential lives of every president from Truman to Obama, I could not think of a phrase or sentence that reflected any partisanship of the authors.  This is high praise.<br /><br />This is a fine detailed history of the ex-Presidents' influence on their successors.  Even if you think you've kept up with the news over the last 60 or so years, you are sure to learn a lot - for good or for ill - in this wonderfully readable tome.<br /><br />The authors give plenty of background.  The research was incredible.  Every fact is backed with a quote or reference.  All of it fits and enhances their history and major themes.  The themes?  Ex-presidents want two things: to preserve the office and its dignity and to contribute once out of office.  These themes recurred and the authors included instances on both counts of when these were assets to America and when they probably were not (see primarily Nixon).<br /><br />Although the book looks daunting, it is so well written that the reader's interest is held throughout.  Parts read like a novel.  Highly recommended especially for political and presidential wonks.

B005LAII8A|5.0|This is NOT one of those sleek sci-fi movies like \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" or \\"Surrogates.\\"<br /><br />'Looper' is sci-fi noir, and is more akin to 'Blade Runner' in depicting a future where things are like our world, but not quite as nice.  Drug use is rampant among those who can afford it. Poverty is in abundant supply.  Power belongs to the criminals.  One group of criminals are called \\"Loopers\\" and their job is to kill people who are sent back from the future.  Occasionally the looper has to kill himself; at which point they are given a golden handshake and are sent off to retire with a huge supply of money.<br /><br />This story kicks into high gear when one person sent back from the future (Willis) knocks out his younger self (Leavit) and seeks to rewrite history by killing the criminal mastermind from the future before he gets into power. At this point the story starts asking time travel philosophy questions, morality questions, and there are absolutely no holds barred as violence and mayhem ensue amidst the theoretical analysis being done.<br /><br />All the actors are terrific, and the movie's pacing is taut from the moment Willis appears on-screen.

B009GENZ12|2.0|Its sort of a interesting story but it is definitely proof that Hollywood elitists live on a different planet. In the Great Depression days this sort of thing really went on and it was not justified by any means. Although it wasn't exactly what this movie depicts... its was done for profit in the great depression days. I would like to elaborate but I'm afraid I'll give up the big surprise ending. This movie seems to be trying to give some sort of justification or virtue to the act. But as I said I think it gives more insight into the perverse minds of Hollywood elitists.

1401322786|5.0|The Time Keeper by Mitch Albom is a novel about mankind's greatest obsession: time. Some people want more, some people want less. Sometimes it moves too fast, sometimes it moves too slow.<br /><br />The Time Keeper is a story that really gets you to think about time in a different and more precious way. It makes you really think about things in a more insightful way, which is a true talent of the author.<br /><br />This novel follows the lives of three people and their obsession with time. It all started with Dor, the original man who discovered time and how to keep track of it. This \\"Father Time\\" did it just \\"to know.\\" However, as mankind tends to do, it was taken and used as something else, and man eventually tried to control time.<br /><br />Dor is punished and sentenced to thousands of years in a cave. He doesn't age, but everyone else on Earth does. He is able to listen to everyone's prayers about time, but eventually it becomes too much and he rarely hears any single person's prayers or thoughts about it at all.<br /><br />Two of the people he did hear are Victor and Sarah. Victor is dying, and wants more time. Sarah wants less time. She wants to speed things up, and eventually make it stop for her altogether. Dor is finally freed from the cave, if he can help two people the true meaning and value of time. Can he get to them both before it is too late? I'll let you read this amazing book to find out.<br /><br />Mitch Albom has a way of writing that draws you in, teaches your soul a life lesson, and leaves you wanting to read more of his works. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of The Time Keeper, Hyperion, for providing me with a copy of this book for review. All opinions expressed are my own.

Follett's smooth style blends sub-plots thousands of miles apart into a seamless tale about the events before, during and after World War II. Despite a heavy dose of social politics, the plot flows quickly and creates continual interest, through vibrant characterizations and lively, believable story elements.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Ethan Burke  is a secret service agent who is sent to Wayward Pines to look for two lost agents. Coming into town he is in a terrible car accident that leaves him disoriented and wounded. When he leaves the hospital he can't seem to get his belongings , his wallet or other identification and he is getting terrible headaches. Even though people are friendly he can't seem to leave town.Its like he is being held there.  I truly enjoyed this book  it is right up there with his other books. Run, Snowbound, Draculas which was cowritten  with J.a Konrath. I f you love a non stop thriller than this is a book you should diffently read.
B008FOB124|4.0|I've been a huge fan of DCD for years. Loved 'em when they were Medieval, loved them when things went a little more tribal. I was sad to see them go their separate ways, & excited to see a new CD.<br />Unfortunately, the new work seems to lean toward what I'd always thought were the weaknesses in their CDs, too much of the Brendan Perry dirge. Don't get me wrong- I love the guy's voice, but a few mid-tempo dirges go a long way. There are no real low-lights or high-lights on the CD. \\"Into the Labyrinth\\" & \\"Toward the Within\\" were much better efforts. It's as if Dead Can Dance decided a new album would be a good idea, but when the time came to make it, nobody really had their heart in it. So, if you were expecting that after their hiatus Dead Can Dance would return to the studio, re-invented, energized & the material would be an exploration of sonic places previously unexplored, or even a continuation of their best stuff, you're going to be disappointed- it's all familiar territory.

B003L20IJM|2.0|Two stars for decent production values and a few good lines. The story was a rehash of the first Nanny McPhee plot, told against the backdrop of WWII. What was charming in the first movie, upon replay, became flat and disappointing. Not even Maggie Smith could overcome a poorly-written, poorly-directed script. She became just another cartoon character. Over-reliance on stock characters (e.g. the deceitful brother-in-law) made it a cartoon instead of a movie. Magic, plus slow pacing, made this movie a tired attempt to earn money off the McPhee franchise. The ending relied too much on special effects to draw it out like some sort of fireworks-like grand finale, but it became boring halfway through.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I put buying this holster, opting for velcro-flapped ones instead.  I gotta say, I'm glad I finally picked one of these up, because I'm very happy with it.  I'm in the tunnel construction industry, so having a good flashlight on my hip at all times is very important to me.  A good holster is an unsung hero in making this happen.  The clip on Nite-Ize holster is extremely secure.  I've been using it for a month now and it's performed perfectly.  Great holster Nite-Ize!

B008NW67E0|5.0|I've listened to this album about 4 times all the way through and it does not disappoint. I'm extremely impressed with Mumford and Sons being able to keep their \\"sound\\". They have a unique thing going and it's nice to see a band continue into their next album without completely changing.<br /><br />If you purchase, you've got to go for the deluxe edition. Those added songs are fantastic!

B00009P1MP|5.0|America Pie has been repackaged in several cd collections, but this cd is the best. It contains the song \\"Crossroads\\".  It's not well known, but it's a classic.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|I first heard the opening track\\"1/1\\" on a celestial-themed compilation album knowing it was an excerpt version. It grabbed my ears especially when biking late at night in a small city when most of everyone else had gone to bed and it was quite an experience. It would be years though but I finally decided to give it's parent album \\"Music For Airports\\" a listen and I have to say that this is a must-have in your music collection, even if you hate New Age music in almost all of it's forms.<br /><br /> The title may be aimed at creating a mood about waiting at an airport, especially at night but this could easily be among the greatest 'night-time' themed albums of all time. The opening track 1/1 is a minimalist song with a strange blend of electronica, and jazz style, but played in a New Age, pre-1980s space-music style with subtle atmospherics. The second part entitled \\"1/2\\" is 10+ minutes of acapella voices sung in a haunting and ambient feel. Considering \\"1/2\\" is almost pure acapella, meaning no instruments at all are performed, except voices, it is just a treat for the ears. \\"2/1\\" is a minimalist piece with just a piano but done really well. The song has a somewhat mournful feel to it, like a lonely astronaut wanting to see someone he/she hasn't seen while on a long journey in space. The final track \\"2/2\\" is a beautiful, and electronic song with a haunting mix of late 1970s ambience that by it's standards is among the most innovative-sounding pieces of all time in my book. It is almost, the opposite of 1/1 in the sense of atmospherics taking the forefront.<br /><br /> It is quite amazing to hear how Eno completely changed his style of music from almost pure early-1970s rock/pop with \\"Here Come The Warm Jets\\", to the oddity of \\"Another Green World\\", and finally evolving into \\"Music For Airports\\". No offense to HCTWJ but both AGW and MFA are my favorite Eno works of mine, as of this writing. I'm well aware of subsequent releases but I've never had a chance to listen to them. When I do, I'll review them. But either way, 1978's \\"Music For Airports\\" is simply put a historic, important, and essential work of art by Eno. He has done marvelous work, both solo and producing, and performing with and for other musicians over the years. Considering that this album was released in 1978, I am amazed at how modern it sounds even by 2012-13 standards. I wasn't even born when it came out, and I think it sounds just as fresh and modern as almost anything that came out 30-plus years since it's release. Highly recommended.them.

B004ZG5F0K|4.0|What I really enjoyed about this film was that it was from the vantage point of two young boys who really don't grasp the situation they are in. All of the actors do a great job and the story is engrossing. There are films that you guess the ending before it happens and you are either still intrigued or you are somewhat disengaged, here I was fully engaged and pleased with the result. Give it a watch and you might find yourself still thinking about it days later.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|I loved this book as a child. It was one of my favourites and now all three of my daughters love it as much as I did.  Everyone should get to enjoy this classic children's story
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|When I heard Bob Ezrin was going to remix \\"Destroyer\\" I thought \\"WHY?\\".. The last remaster sounded fine to my ears, so I approached buying this CD with some apprehension. Would he mess it up with digital reverb and gated drums like the \\"Smashes, Thrashes and Hits\\" comp did in the 80's, or really tick off old KISS fans by giving it a retarded dance-oriented remix? Thank God (I mean Gene) that didn't happen!<br /><br />One thing most diehard KISS fans didn't like about \\"Destroyer\\" in the day was it's slickness to appeal to AM Top 40 and FM Album Rock radio at the time. Guitars were pushed back and vocals were brought up in the mix. After the rawness of ALIVE I my jr. high freinds thought they were trying to sound exactly like Alice Cooper. The LP was a huge success, but 35 years after, \\"Destroyer\\" is still an album that divides many KISS fans.<br /><br />The new remix is still slick and gimmicky as hell with Ezrin's trademark heavy use of sound effects, choirs, reverb and tape echo. But the guitars, drums and especially Gene's basswork have a nice bite and fullness to them that the original mix didn't have. The vocals have a brighter clarity to them too. If you thought Ezrin's original mix lacked \\"balls\\" his new remix has plenty of it in spades.<br /><br />Otherwise if you practically have memorized this album, you really won't hear anything new except for little subtleties that were buried in the original mix.<br /><br />And \\"Destroyer Resurrected\\" won't appeal to those KISS fans who wanted a gimmick free remix like the Beatles \\"Let It Be - Naked\\" was. If you never liked this album, you sill won't like it now.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like is just ONE bonus track? C'mon! They could have easily added instrumental mixes, demos or alternate mixes. And having the original 45 single versions could have been a nice touch too. The booklet about the making of this album and pictures are amusing but that doesn't make up for the skimpiness of the CD.<br /><br />And the huge cinematic feel of \\"Destroyer\\" just begs for a 5:1 surround sound DVD remix!<br /><br />So is \\"Resurrected\\" worth buying? Only if you loved the original album and want a re-freshened take on it. To newer fans who have never heard this album before - I suggest save some yourself some cash and buy the last CD reissue to hear what we older KISS fans heard in 1976.
1451627289|4.0|Stephen King's novel 11/22/63 is an engaging narrative of a high school teacher who has stumbled upon a rare opportunity to change history. A time portal, which, by the way, is one of the best descriptions of a time portal that I've ever read, transports our time traveler to a specific day in history - September 9, 1958. Of all historical events that could be changed, the JFK assassination is just within reach for our protagonist and just far enough for Stephen King to offer us a full length novel before reaching that fateful day.<br /><br />Over the years, I have read a couple of Stephen King novels - It and The Shining. And although they were good books, I never became a particularly big fan of King ... maybe because I don't particularly like living in a constant state of shock, fear, and dread. And so, this non-horror novel is perfect for those of us who aren't the typical Stephen King reader. He has an easy going and engaging style of writing that is a pleasure to read. And yet, he brilliantly employs his horror writing techniques in this novel. This is not a horror story; there isn't anything to be afraid of. But King is a master at creating a feeling that there is an outside force that is out to get you. That ominous feeling of impending doom. The past is obdurate. It does not want to be changed.<br /><br />I cannot judge the historical accuracy of this novel as I'm not a historian and I wasn't alive then, but it's reported that King did massive amounts of research for the writing of this book. He pulls it all together seamlessly. He transports you back in time. He made me nostalgic for a time period that I never lived in before. How amazing is that?<br /><br />The premise of the book and the title is about a time traveler trying to prevent the JFK assassination, but it takes a long time to get there. (My main complaint is that this book is too long. Much too long.) Meanwhile, we are treated to a compelling love story. When I finished reading the last page, I wondered to myself, \\"Who would've guessed that King was a great romance novelist?\\"wondered to myself, \\"Who would've guessed that King was a great romance novelist?\\"
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Any Batman fan knows what the state the of the franchise was (movie wise) after Batman and Robin. Nolan's trilogy of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and Dark Knight rises not only brought it back from the dead, it outdid Tim Burton's movies (both of which were very good). What Nolan did best was never treated the story as strictly a superhero or action movie, and as such did not take many of the easy shortcuts (see the Transformers movies) that many of those movies can take.<br /><br />While I do not think that any character in this movie came close to being as good as what Heath Ledger did with the Joker in Dark Knight, I do think all the actors played their characters well, and they were all well written. I did not have as big an issue with Bane's voice as some. Granted I found I could understand him better seeing it the second time than the first. I also think they did a great job of tying in the other movies (especially Batman Begins) to this one whether through flashbacks or bringing back some of the other characters. I also thought Anne Hathaway did a very good job as Catwoman. She definitely played the \\"out for herself\\" role well, and balanced the kind of good, kind of bad that the character called for.<br /><br />My only issue with the movie is that there were a couple editing spots where Batman would have literally had to have been two places at once. When he saves Gordon after the \\"trial\\" and then saves Blake moments later is the big one. Nor is it ever explained how Bruce gets back to Gotham City after he escapes from the prison, which given what happens earlier in the film should have been no easy feat.<br /><br />That said, I think they did a good job tying up Christian Bale's part of the story. The ending certainly left the possibility of future movies open, and I am sure the studio wants to do more of them. Hopefully if and when that decision is made whomever is put in charge will follow Nolan's approach and focus on quality acting and writing, and blend elements of realism into it when possible. That is what makes the movie (and the entire trilogy) work.

Very rare for an artist(including Dylan) to create a record where every song stands on its own.  If you like Dylan, you will LOVE this.  If you don't like Dylan, beware, you will after listening to Tempest.
B007FQDPL8|5.0|True Blood season 1 is very entertaining. The Blu-ray's look great. 60hz no problem, no low fps. I highly recommend this for True Blood fans.
0143119680|1.0|First of all, I have to admit I didn't finish this book. This is really rare for me, but this book was just so mindlessly boring. I am surprised/appalled that this book has such a high rating at Amazon.<br /><br />****SPOILERS****<br /><br />I'll summarize it into positive and negative points:<br /><br />Positive points:<br />+Interesting blurb and a good start on the book.<br />+The book was long.<br /><br />Negative points:<br />-The book was long.<br />-The plot was... not at all structured. It was also shoddily made. Like a an ugly, but necessary backdrop for the the main characters to wine and dine in.<br />-The heroine went from independent witch/scientist woman to weak and kept woman the instant the hero was introduced. Seriously!?<br />-They spent most of their time drinking fancy wine and doing magical yoga. Seriously.<br />-The women all went from strong independent women to silent/we-belong-in-the-kitchen-mode if there were men present. And no, there was no magical viruses that made them that way either, it seems the author just has some very outdated views here.<br />-I spent most of my time waiting... and waiting for the plot/action. Most of the book(I read about half-way, about 300-400 pages) read as a really long dull date.<br />-Don't you just hate it when out of the blue the couple decide they have to wait for marriage to have sex? They were getting into it.. and bam-- \\"Naw, I think we should wait until marriage\\". *eyeroll* I don't mind if it's obvious for cultural, religious or other obvious pre-established reasons, but this just came out of nowhere.<br /><br />So after I was done with this book I left it in a \\"give-away\\"-pile my dorm has. To be honest I felt guilty about leaving such a disgrace of a book there. THAT's how awful I thought this book was.

B007FG9LIE|2.0|This is actually a sci-fi book, but it doesn't say it is.  I was lead to believe it would be a quirky murder mystery, but it's complete rubbish.  The writing drags on and on, only to reveal a stupid ending.  Can't believe I finished it.  Don't waste your time.
B0098VXMNE|1.0|The first two seasons were awesome. This one was a waste of time and money. The show seemed forced, too much focus on CGI and not enough on plot, and the adult scenes were pointless. My husband didn't even want to finish watching it. I only saw the whole thing because I couldn't sleep one night. It was that bad. In my opinion skip it, leave the memory of the good Spartacus intact.
034580404X|5.0|I hesitated to purchase these books at first but purchased them after a friend said she loved them.  I am so glad that I listened as I wasn't able to put the books down.  I read through all three in just over a week.  I will definitely keep these books and read them again.  It was easy to get pulled into the story line and there were some parts that even echoed my life.  Thanks to EL James for creating such a captivating trilogy.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I have read other reviews and I agree that Katniss becomes unlikeable in this book.  The thing that I kept thinking over and over was she needed to stop feeling sorry for herself.  \\"It's ALL MY  FAULT\\" was the recurring whining that came from her. Like the entire world revolved around her.  But, then I remembered she was 17 and it explained a lot :) At first I was disappointed with the guy she ended up with, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized it was the right one.  I agree also, that this was an interesting way to portray a futuristic society.  I found the resemblence between this society and ancient Rome interesting as well.  I read all three books one right after another, so there was a continuation of the story.  All in alll I like it and would recommend it to others.
B002ZG9800|3.0|\\"I Love You Phillip Morris,\\" based on the exploits of Con Man Steven Russell, is at times hilarious, touching, ironic, and sad. Closeted Russell (Jim Carrey) has a life-changing moment after a near fatal accident and begins living openly as a gay man. He discovers, as he states, that \\"being gay is really expensive,\\" and begins a series of con games to keep a cute boyfriend Rolexed and in living in luxury. It catches up with him and he goes off to prison in Texas where he meets Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor) a soft-spoken inmate who becomes the love of Russell's life. Replete with crazy schemes and fraud-galore, \\"I Love You Phillip Morris\\" manages to be sad more than anything else. The fact that Mr. Russell had to find love in prison and then steal to keep it, is ironic. Mr. McGregor is excellent as cute but dumb Phillip but Carrey's performance is more problematic. He's fine when swindling people (though it is a retread of his \\"Liar Liar\\" personna) but woefully unconvincing as a gay man in search of love. That goofy grin and rubber face don't work for him here and his swishy demeanor seems forced and synthetic. Would love to have seen what Matt Damon (the original choice to play Steven Russell) could have done with this.
B00846REIS|4.0|Very much liked this novel.  First I have read by Sylvia Day.  Almost felt like a knock-off of \\"50 Shades\\", yet not quite.  Easy read.  Very much looking forward to the sequel.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The movie is about a variety of older people who've found they're either not well off enough to retire where they'd like, or are simply looking for an adventure to revitalize their lives.<br /><br />All of the characters were well played, and distinct in their personalities.<br /><br />This was a powerful movie, from great joys, humorous moments, and deep sadness.<br />We see people go from despair to hopeful, or simply coming to peace with making the best of their situation.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie, and would watch it again.

0316228532|1.0|J.K. Rowling has proven in the past to be a great storyteller.  The Casual Vacancy, however, is not her best work.  I am disappointed with the profanity and vulgar language in her book.  A good author does not need to resort to foul language and explicit sex scenes to entertain adults.  I am very disappointed with this book--I am sending it back!
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Wow. I'm a mom...and have been for 20+ years. Married to a wonderful<br />man. The reason I think this could've been called, \\"Men of Faith\\" was<br />because I've gone to several different \\"Women of Faith\\" conferences,<br />and they gave me the same \\"aha\\" kinda moment as a Mom that this movie<br />should give all dads. It will truly make you think about what it means<br />to be a man, what it means to be a good father not just in society's<br />eyes but in God's eyes. I really respected the \\"resolution\\" the men<br />made to be better fathers, and all it entailed (won't spoil it for<br />you!). As someone else said, if you don't cry at this movie, then<br />nothing will make you cry. The reason I gave it a 4/5 stars was that it<br />definitely put you through the emotional ringer intentionally, and was<br />a bit heavy handed with the God-speak. They could've taken this movie<br />and used it as a general moral compass, and perhaps that would appeal<br />to more people. People come to God when he calls them, not when they're<br />bashed over the head with it. Still, an excellent movie - have a box of<br />tissues nearby!
B004LROMWU|5.0|Falling Skies is by far my favorite TV show. While there were moments in its Season 2 that made me question if i would continue to like it. However this review is on Season 1.<br /><br />Falling Skies season one follows the 2nd Mass (namesake from the revolutionary war 2nd Massachusetts Regiment) which is a resistance force fighting the aliens. Specifically it follows primarily Tom Mason (Noah) and his family and close group of friends and his fire team. In Falling Skies aliens arrive at earth and hover high in the air for roughly 29 days refusing to respond to any attempts of communication. Then without any warning they attack. In the first few days they manage to wipe out the majority of earths population. The majority of the earths military forces are wiped out leaving civilians to fight for humanities freedom. The intent and reasons for the attack are unknown, however the aliens do kidnap children (appears children between 9-18 years of age) they proceed to harness them with what the aliens call a ChemLock it is a grub like organism with 12 metallic spikes that bores into the child's spine and grows roots and allows the aliens to control them. This season follows Tom and the battles of the 2nd Mass along with Tom's struggle to find his harnessed middle son, Ben, and dealing with the challenges of the new world.<br /><br />There is plenty of drama in the show that has the potential to reach out and grab you. There are moments where you can really feel for Tom as he struggles to hold everything together. If your someone who has ever felt like the weight of the world is on your shoulders and that you have to hold it all together. Then you can relate to Tom's character. I certainly enjoy the action when it finally arises and the action can be intense for a TV show however relatively short action scenes. But the build up to the firefights can lead for them to be short but intense and emotionally intense. You find yourself rooting for Tom, his fire team, and the 2nd Mass. For a TV show it has a tendency to keep me on the edge of my seat, for example there comes a time when a man who has made a deal with the aliens where he trades kids for amnesty. He tricks the 2nd Mass in turning over their children which he intended to turn over to the aliens. I found myself having butterflies in my stomach as i watched the event occur. Intently watching to see how it would turn out. The show also has this uncanny ability to make you like even the worst or meanest character in the show by giving them a human side that reveals itself every now and then.<br /><br />Another interesting thing to note about Falling Skies is the vast array of firearms they use there is certainly more than just AK47s and M4/M16s. As a 'gun nut' i found it interesting to see how they certainly broke the mold of standard firearms. There was everything from a SIG 552, Mauser Kar98, L1A1's, FN FAL, and a M240B machine gun to name a few (however the M240B is seen in only 3 episodes). Also there were attempts to teach viewers about firearms, specifically the common misconception that a clip is a magazine. Someone who likes guns will certainly be impressed with how they broke the mold that many TV shows go by (only using M4/M16s and AK47s as rifles).<br /><br />If your someone who likes disaster shows/post apocalyptic/science fiction/ war drama then Falling Skies will likely appeal to you. Falling Skies does however sometimes take a while to build up to a action scene which will appeal to those who like drama.<br /><br />Overall Falling Skies gets 5/5 stars. There is plenty of drama that keeps you connected to the characters. They do a good job showing the love characters have for each other and depicting relationships. The show often throws curve balls to the viewers that completely changes things. This will keep you guessing if what you know is actually the truth. The drama will build up to intense action scenes where the fate of a character or the 2ndMass itself relies on winning the battle. For those of you who like firearms like me you enjoy the variety in the show and how they actually try to throw in some real information and educate the viewers. With all this and more going for it makes it hard to say no to such a good show with so much to offer to so many types viewers (for the sake of those who are reading this trying to figure out if they want to buy it i will leave the rest out so i don't spoil the show for them).<br /><br />Without a doubt worth watching and enjoying.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was such a great story! I loved all the original ideas he had. I finished book 5 and I was sooo sad that it was the end :( Definitely one of the best set of books I have read in a very long time. I do hope he continues this story path in the future. Love them!
B008C1O8CA|4.0|The first installment of this bombastic trilogy doesn't disappoint. I've enjoyed all the sounds Green Day have experimented with<br />and this album is no different. I will say the lyrics this time are a little bland. The album doesn't aspire to be the<br />artsy social statements that preceeded it, just some great rock tunes.<br /><br />The best tracks are \\"Nuclear Family\\", \\"Carpe Diem\\" (which begins with a not so subtle ode to Cheap Trick's \\"Surrender\\"), \\"Kill the<br />DJ\\" (which mocks a lot of what passes for rock these days), \\"Rusty James\\" and \\"Oh Love\\".<br /><br />I can't wait for \\"Dos\\"!
159562015X|4.0|I liked the book, but thought the real value was in the online test, which reveals your best strengths, how they should be utilized, etc. However, I just found out you can buy it online at strengthstest.com! I'll be sending my employees that way in the future.<br /><br />Overall, however, I have found the book to be helpful.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game.  wish there were more coins without paying or waiting but its still a fun game.  __________<br />_________
1593082800|5.0|At first glance The Woman in White is long and unfamiliar - stick with it and you will find a very well-written novel that may have been the first \\"whodunnit\\".  Excellent read.

0316228532|5.0|From the first couple of pages of this book, it was like curling up with an old friend. Sure, there is no magic, or huge victories over evil by the side of good, but the writing is familiar and still just as powerful. The Casual Vacancy is not a happy book, it can be downright depressing, but it's an important book to read. If this book was not written by JK Rowling, it probably would not have been published, which is a real shame. Its an important story about something that is effecting most communities due to the bad economy and harsh austerity measure. The town of Pagford is a wealthy one and when Barry Fairbrother, a do-gooder on the local council dies, a fraction of people want to get rid of the poor district of Fields and the methadone clinic. Like what is happening in the UK and the US and all over, some people would rather let the little guy fend for himself rather than work together as a community to help out everyone. The characters in the book are very flawed. The reader might agree with the views expressed by one character but hate their actions in their private lives. The adults can be huge hypocrites and just down right nasty.<br />JK Rowling is excellent writing about the lives of teenagers and the struggles they have with their parents. Even in the midst of domestic abuse, drug abuse, and rape, by the end there is a feeling of hope. There is a sense that things can change for the better because the next generation doesn't have the same hang-ups or prejudices as their parents.<br />Like I and many have said, it's not an easy book, its gritty and messy, and its real life.
1250000971|3.0|The first book of the clifton chronicles, kept me glued to each page, The sins ofthe Father seemed to have lost steam, first too short, two did not tell the story as well as in the first book, three not enough development on the main charaters.<br />I am a big fan of Jeffery Archer and I don't feel this is his best work, seemed like maybe he was in too big a hurry to get book ready for printing. Hope he gets it back together with book number three.
B000002HMH|3.0|I first listened to the song Ain't Yy Bitch when I walked pass a record store in 1996. The moment I heard it, I knew Metallica's new album had reached my local music store.<br /><br />As I was still a student at that time, I can't afford to buy a music CD but instead, a cassette tape. Nonetheless, I kept on playing this album until the tape broke.<br /><br />Let's be fair, this album is not as bad as people claimed. Music nowadays are far more worse. Cheers.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've read in several sources that Spider is the form of solitaire that affords the best chance of winning via skillful play--without resorting to some type of cheating.  My experience with several solitaire games is that this is true.  This game also allows the flexibility of &#34;back-tracking&#34; through previous moves to try different plays that were forgone on ealier attempts.  This is an excellent game.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett: A Dickens for the 21st century.<br /><br />When I first ran across the name of Ken Follett, it was in the context of the Oprah Book Club. As a properly educated snob, I laughed condescendingly and proceeded to ignore his name.<br /><br />Then I got a Kindle, and the chance to actually read the man's work. What the hell, I thought. Oprah can't always be wrong.<br /><br />She was not. Ken Follett is perhaps the best historical novelist I have read in years. His three-decker novel of the 20th century, beginning with \\"The Fall of Giants\\" and continuing to \\"The Winter of the World\\" - the third segment is due soon, and I can't wait - bears comparison - with some pointed contrast - to Charles' Dickens' portrait of the French Revolution, \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"<br /><br />That is no exaggeration. Please.<br /><br />First, the historical events are foregrounded by the vividly-portrayed lives of fictive characters, in the manner standard in the genre since before Dickens (One thinks of Lord Macaulay's rendition of imagined speeches in his telling of Roman times).<br /><br />Second, the range of fictional characters crosses class and social boundaries - in Follett's case, his sympathies are clearly with the Welsh miners-cum-soldiers, crossing both as-yet-published volumes; there is a horrific description of the slaughter of volunteers for the Spanish Civil War in the second book, for example - but he also describes, in risqué detail, the sexual lives of the idle rich, down to foreplay that is a graphic as any you've ever read (these are not RL Stevenson-style boys' books, by any means.<br /><br />Third, the well-researched, plausible detail is buttressed by casually discussed conversations between characters linked to historical figures, with German, American, Russian and British story-lines crossing one another, as they in fact did, both before and after World War I (the subjects of the first and then the second volume of this trilogy).<br /><br />What will comenext, in the volume yet to be released, taking us - it is promised - thro the Sixties that many of us survived, in one shape or another? I can hardly wait; but I have a Kindle, and I'm not afraid to use it.<br /><br />Thank you, Oprah, and my apologies for taking so long to pick up on your Book Club suggestion. Maybe I'm learning something as I get older. I certainly hope so.<br /><br />John McLaughlin, PhD

B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Not all movies available today are as sweetly retold as this re-do of the Cinderella classic tale.<br />It's actors carry their parts as an ensemble and no deeply evil theme is portayed as the more recent fairy tale plot movies.  It is nice to have a sweet choice like this one.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This movie was very entertaining throughout the movie. Especially if your into science fiction. The acting was great. The directing and filming was great as well. Highly recommended!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story was not actually predictable so that made it interesting. It was also well written and the voices were different. I cannot decide if the ending was the right one or the author did not know quite where to go with the end of the story. A good read.

B007M45PMU|4.0|The first five songs are really good. That's about the length of my commute so that's what I've heard mostly. Haven't found one yet that I skip over. 'Hey Ho' is the song everyone has heard, and it is good, although the lyrics are nothing to write home about. 'Classy Girls' is my favorite. 'Dead Sea' is really good, too. Amazon said I might like this since I like the Avett Brothers, and they were right. Very simple, raw, folk music. Just what I love.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is so much fun. I could not put it down. Good story and good graphics. Can't wait for the sequel!!!!! Definitely get this game.

B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is so amazing that I soil Myself when I really think about it I would play day and night if I could. definetelynworth the money. don't even buy the lite version.
B004132HZS|5.0|A twenty-first century version of Holmes - English style as it should be.<br />The actors are not popularly known here in the U.S. but they are good actors non the less.<br />Granted the series is sort of like a mini-series with each show about 1 hr and 30 min. But this is good because it can create more on the story's plot and character development - unlike the 45 minute U.S. show.<br /><br />This was before cbs ripped it off and called it Elementary (staring British actor Johnny Lee Miller). Can't they come up with something original? First 'Prime Suspect' now this. Plus that Sy-fi channel ripped off 'Being Human.' I guess the Brits can do better acting and writing.<br /><br />I love the actors in the BBC's version and the suspense is awesome.

0385335482|4.0|I am a fan of the 3 first shopaholic books (after that they get redundant w/ Becky never really learning to stop spending so dang much). Sophia Kinsella's Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Bloomwood is a comedic take on a woman with an obsessive need to buy designer clothes. This of course puts her into a crazy amount of debt to creditors.<br /><br />Becky has an obsession for designer clothes. Because of her addiction to spend she has credit card debts that are astronomical. Sophia made Becky's character is both unrealistic and comedic. She is at times a little annoying because you want her to stop her insane need for designer-ware stuff.<br /><br />Liked the first three books of this series. The following books (sister, baby and toddler) just made the heroine out to be a selfish woman who never got over her obsession to spend too much money.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really did enjoy reading this book. It's very fast and you keep reading and reading. My only con is the ending. I would have liked something with more closure.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I looked forward to revisiting a few much-loved places with Harold:  Berwick-upon-Tweed, Coldstream, Kelso, Bath . . . and following his progress via a map of England and Scotland . . . it was a beautiful mind-pilgrimage.  But why must life-affirming stories be so sad?
0385342063|5.0|Woman loses engagement ring then gets her cellphone stolen. Finds a phone in a trash bin that belongs to a company. The owner needs it back but she won't give it to him.<br /><br />This had a good plot and character developments.  This might be my favorite Kinsella book.  Heroine and hero communicate a lot through texts and emails. There wasn't much interaction between the two. I think that the distance was perfect. It allowed the heroine to decide on her own if she wants to marry the man she's been engaged to throughout the story.  I really liked this plot and writing style.

1401937519|5.0|What an inspiring and positive book. Ms. Moorjani has totally captured the aspects of the beautiful power within all of us because of our connectedness to the I AM, and to each other. It is a book that will surprise and excite you because of its truth and its powerful message. No one can remain in mediocrity or despair after reading her true spiritual and healing story. I purchased a book for every one of my children and their families to read. It is still available on Amazon.com though for awhile the publisher itself was on back order with this book.
B002RI9YE6|5.0|Beautifully written , melancholy at times, humorous at other times, I found myself deeply sympathetic to but at other times deeply frustrated by Stevens' unbending sense of duty.<br />Stevens is the butler at a grand house, now with diminished  staff and in the employ of \\"an American gentleman\\".  Things are quiet and his employer encourages him to take a little holiday, giving him use of the Ford and offering to pay for petrol. Stevens sets off, with the aim to see a bit of the countryside but also to meet up with the former housekeeper, who has just left her husband to propose she rejoin the staff. As he travels he recollect past events at Darlington Hall where he was an observer and sometimes a participant. Some of the events are very amusing such as when he is recruited to explain the facts of life to the Lord's godson. Other events like the sacking of the two Jewish maids , and the death of Stevens' father are disturbing and  very, very sad. Through it all the relationship of the butler and housekeeper with all its misunderstandings, talking at crosspurposes  and emotional blindness of Stevens towards Miss Kenton, creates a fascinating but somewhat frustrating read. At times I just wanted to reach into the words and shake Stevens!<br />I have not seen the film and I am not sure I want to as I would hate it if they changed that ending.

B000MD9UJC|4.0|Been using this upgrade for nearly two weeks nightly and love it.  The pushbutton feels a little cheap as it rattles around but works great so far.  The LED light is a fantastic upgrade from the original bulb in my MAGMINI.  I have a jet black dog and it really helps light him up as we walk each evening.  Also used it as a flood light while building my wood shed this past weekend and it lit the walls very well, allowing me to finish putting up the siding.  Would recommend this package to anyone looking to get better use out of an old MAGMINI.  Well worth the purchase.
B0050R0XEG|4.0|This set was very enjoyable to put together, and because of the vast assortment of brick types, it felt more like assembling a puzzle than other sets. (\\"Where is that piece?\\") By contrast, the Robie House - another great set - has very little variety in brick types, so putting that set together is more of an OCD exercise.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some parts of the van are assembled with just a few contact points holding them together, so they fall appart very easily. Like other reviewers, I had the front of the roof crumble many times in my hand while I tried to construct it, and even remainder of the roof is attached only by a few points, so it will come off if you raise the pop-up tent too carelessly. Likewise, I've had the engine fall out a several times, and the back doors are exceptionally fragile.<br /><br />I resorted to gluing these weak points together - something I generally consider taboo - as I got sick of reassembling them.<br /><br />Still, don't let that stop you from getting the set - It's one of the best available.
1439102430|3.0|Kathy Reichs has an impressive track record and she brings her expertise to her books. She also has an engaging cast of characters and a plot convoluted enough to keep the reader guessing...sort of. Usually it works fine. Here however I felt short-changed. There is so much technical stuff and so much information about the topography of Canada and the problems of some native Canadians that the story itself has to shrink to accomodate all these details. At a guess, 40% Temperance and her fellow characters and 60% data. It tends to get tedious at times. Also I have a problem with one detail (spoiler ahead!). How come neighbors etc never felt anything wrong when decomposition started? Not once, but twice?<br />Still I guess I shall buy the next book....
B0063IH60K|1.0|This game plays as well as any solitaire apps on my other devices. The trouble with this \\"free\\" app is that each time I start a game a commercial pops up with lots of music and noise. It's difficult to close them. They all close differently and some are very stubborn about closing. I doubt I will use this app again as the commercials are so irritating and some are offensive - which is probably why such an innocuous game has a \\"with guidance\\" rating.

0307949486|4.0|I'm absolutely thrilled about this novel for several reasons, the first of which is I actually got to read it before watching Hollywood got its hands on it.<br />The main reason I enjoyed this novel is its locale -- Sweden. As an American who loves to read mysteries, I've about had my fill of stories set in the United States. The characters are nearly indistinguishable. The protagonist, usually a private eye, is nearly always a tough-guy with smart mouth. The cops are always portrayed as complete jerks. The genre almost always abides by a cookie-cutter formula to writing.<br />This book was cut from a different cloth. The novelist, Stieg Larsson, was a former journalist, and as a former journalist myself, I dug his style, which was methodical and patient -- quite different than wordy and overly bloated.<br />And that Larssen uses two flawed characters -- reporter Mikael Blomkvist and the mysterious, troubled prodigy Lisbeth Salander -- as his protagonists, rather than some stereotypes, makes the story all the more original.<br />What Larssen did for me was to take me somewhere I've never been -- Sweden. And through the dialogue and actions of his secondary and tertiary characters, Larssen conveys a sense of the Nordic country.<br />Is the story perfect? No. There are some scenarios that end up being a little too convenient -- one is nearly a deus ex machina. But overall, it works.<br />There are many ways and many characters a writer can use to solve a mystery. I think Larssen did it well and in a refreshingly original way. It's a good read, and in spite of the novel's length, I blew right through it, which shows how readable it is.<br />Larssen wrote a trilogy before he died (along with drafts of seven more novels in the series), so here is an acid test a prospective buyer should look at: After having read this, will I read the next in the series, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire?\\" Absolutely. Will I read any of the seven novels that someone else writes based on Larssen's drafts? No. His style was too original to copy. Besides, a good writer always leaves you wanting more. And Larssen did just that.sen's drafts? No. His style was too original to copy. Besides, a good writer always leaves you wanting more. And Larssen did just that.

B002RI9MWA|4.0|I found this story a welcome insight into the world of Pakistanis abroad and also thought-provoking regarding the attitude of Westerners towards Pakistanis. The first person voice was engaging, as were the frequent references to real time as the story was being told. I enjoyed this story very much.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is great, there is so many great ideas. You can find many different interesting ideas.  There isn't much you can 't find.  I am hooked.
B004LQEYAG|4.0|I have been a big fan of Robert Redford's for probably 30 years or more, and I thought that Paul Newman gave the performance of a lifetime in the film \\"The Color of Money.\\"  Therefore, it's quite odd that I've never seen this film before until yesterday (2012Sep30).<br /><br />Maybe it's just that I'm really hit-and-miss on Westerns.  I loved \\"The Proposition\\" as I thought that was near perfect; American westerns tend to look at criminals too much in a romantic light, and that Australian film surely did not make that common mistake.<br /><br />But I also really like comedy.  While I believe that this film is listed in the former genre and not necessarily the latter, I really liked the western parts but some of the comedy parts?  Not so much.  In particular, there is a scene where Mr. Newman is riding a bike with Katherine Ross on the handlebars.  Now that was an odd scene, the music was slapstick, and I don't think that it really worked within the framework of the rest of the film.  It was as if they called up Woody Allen and said, \\"Hey, Woody, could you write part of a screenplay for us?  It's got a guy and a gal on a bike, and we need it to be funny.\\"  (For disclosure, I am a big fan of Mr. Allen's as well but I'm not convinced that even he could write a western screenplay.)<br /><br />Besides this misfire, I believe the rest of the film works.  Mr. Redford was excellent, as usual, and Mr. Newman was only a notch below.  Now, where I believe the comedy works:  the banter between these two leads was quite funny, and I still bought it.  Many movies have funny banter and you think, \\"Nah.  Someone in this situation would not say that in this situation,\\" but I believe not here.<br /><br />What's the theme of the film?  Well, how 'bout, \\"Crime doesn't pay,\\" perhaps.  You can only run so long and so far if you're a criminal.  And then you just run out of time and space.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE Pinterest and I am so happy I finally decided to go ahead and try the app. It is not without slight inconvenient issues&hellip; such as Force close on my kindle- but the benefits far outweigh any problems.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app works great on my Kindle Fire. I love pinning whenever and wherever I want. It is so easy and convenient to use, I was surprised.
B005EGXTL2|2.0|Good fast read for adults, mostly a teenage book.I have definatly had better reading experiences but am glad I did read it.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|The movie was direct and provoked thoughts of family, healing, perserverance, understanding and self awareness. A movie to be seen by all.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I adore pinterest and love the idea of accessing it anywhere via my kindle fire. Sadly I have noticed this particular application quits often if I am lucky enough to get it started at all.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My entire family loved this movie. It was wonderful. My toddler watches it continuousl The songs are catchy, it is well written. Even my 9 year old son loved and and he says he's grown out of cartoons.

B008F5YDRI|5.0|I saw this film in the theater and fell in love with the locations, filming, ideas...etc<br />Lasse Halstrom did an amazing job directing and filming the actors and locations.  I am ready to visit Scotland, Morocco(taking the place of Yemen)and the busy streets of London!  Relax and enjoy!<br />If you love traveling then this would be a wonderful purchase to enjoy watching over and over again! Fly fishing too! :-)
B008AWBQGW|5.0|great cd- like this music just as well as there older music. Shows how the great bands keep on putting great music out.
B0081KTI0E|2.0|Unless you have a teen age girl crazy about Daniel, you will be able to skip this.  If you have to watch, have a good book, puzzles, knitting, or something else interesting to do while it plays.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is awesome. I have only recently stared to like reading and I've never had that special book that I just couldn't put down. But when I started reading the first book of this trilogy I just couldn't stop. I love every thing about it and (I'm not going to spoil anything) I LOVE the way it ended and who Katniss ended up with.<br /><br />I would recommend this trilogy to teens and not adults. I would also say that you should read the books first and then watch the movie because the books are way better.<br /><br />So finally to all you people who say these books suck,I'm sorry,you obviously didn't get the point because its an awesome trilogy. And I'm SO sad I've finished the trilogy but I will happily read the it again and again and again......
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a great book. it is full of twists. I would suggest this to anyone. i loved it very much
B005I6EU7U|5.0|The cover is perfect. I tried to pick one that I would like and also one that my grandson would feel comfortable being seen with if he would ever want to borow the Kindle. This covers has a classic look that suits both old and young tastes.
B009329ZF2|3.0|I don't want my money back, but I don't need to see it ever again.  By the way, why was Rhianna in the movie?
B005P68PSI|5.0|Still trying too figure out why I haven't started watching this show from the beginning! It's really great!! I love all the characters, and I love how the concept of the show can keep the series going for a very long time. If and when it does come to an end, I'd be quite sad cause its been one helluva ride!!! I am also very geared up for season 8!! Whoo hoo!!
B007SGLZH6|5.0|Made a first loaf--I didn't expect much and hoy cow. I made Leahy's version of no-knead earlier in the day and this is much much better. Beautiful, tall loaves, deep rich color to the crust, fluffy texture. My final proof was not pretty on entry to the pan, but it turned out great. Buy the book--even the kindle edition.  I think it's really worth it. (Kindle has all charts, hyper links, and photos.)
0425263908|5.0|Very good book. Easy reading. Along the same lines and very similar story line as 50 Shades of Grey.  Would recommend to all 50 Shades fans.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Contunues to \\"crash\\". Will not load on the Kindle even after re-set. All other apps are loading correctly. Very frustrating!
0385360169|3.0|Sometimes I look up, ahem, stories on the Internet that I find better.  Mildly interesting book.  I probably will read the series just out of curiosity.  Very unrealistic story.
B0098VXE50|2.0|The movie was great but when downloaded to watch it, it was not in full HD, it's more like regular dvd. The tech person I've hired says I have the latest and explained it just the way it was recieved. I rather buy the disc and/or watch it in non HD and save cost in the future.
B004WYXHAU|5.0|I pretty much love all Masterpiece shows and Upstairs Downstairs is no exception. If you enjoyed Downton Abbey, you will enjoy this too!!
B009329ZF2|5.0|Starts out silly but once that younger brother is in the Navy, a multitude of events happen to strenthen his courage and develop cunning and shrewdness as a leader. Great editing and terrific plot. I loved this movie!!
B005LAJ1O0|1.0|I'm going to finish this show because I spent like $40 on the darn thing, BUT ... <spoiler alerts ahead> ... halfway through, I'm desperately scrambling to find some reason to like it.<br /><br />I mean ... quick ... name your top 5 favorite horror films of all time. Name what you see as the critically recognizable best top 10 horror films of all time. Know what all 10 of these films have in common? YOU LIKE AT LEAST ONE FRIGGIN CHARACTER! I mean, sheesh! Every last person in this thing - over hours and hours - fails to present one scene that makes you care if they live or have their heads chopped off!<br /><br />Obviously, every last dead character is detestable. And the neighbor, Jessica Lange, is supposed to be detestable (telling her daughter to spit into a cupcake for the neighbors; locking her mentally challenged daughter in a closet with mirrors, etc....).<br /><br />But our three living house owners are also all horrible human beings. The daughter is BEYOND rotten to the core. She's falling for a dead, Columbine killer clone ... so much so that she lies about her mom's trauma AND orchestrates it so that her mom is stuck in a house that is destroying her. I could go on and on and on. She is, in my oppinion, the most detestable of all the characters though.<br /><br />And then there's the mom. Look, the husband cheated. That sucks and it's a jerky thing to do. But, she doesn't spend even one scene trying to be nice to him. She screams at him every friggin episode. She drives him from the house, she whines incessantly. She tries to move to Boston with the daughter. She. Is. Awful. HORRIFIC.<br /><br />The dad's probably the best character. But he sure doesn't make you smile and he did cheat on her wife.<br /><br />Horrific.<br /><br />Please. Someone please tell me - give me a reason - to like any character in this thing, some reason to root for these guys. Anything?

B002GHHHL0|4.0|In enjoyed this movie but I bought it as a gift for my daughter and grand-daughter. They liked it so much that they wanted it in their collection of movies.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book, this whole trilogy was just a joy to read, I didn't want it to end. Larsson's writing style really impressed me from the start. His own intelligence oozes off the pages. His characters, especially Lisbeth are so complex, and yet slightly flawed like real people. It's a tragedy that we will never get any new books by this talented author.
B003MC5N28|4.0|SPOILER ALERT<br />High interest book for middle grade readers. Some sensitive issues are covered, opening up opportunities for dialog and discussion about euthanasia, socialism, etc. If you have a reluctant reader in your family, this book may be worth looking at. My son is a reluctant reader, even with a higher than average reading level for his age. This was one of the few books he has read without a lot of nagging. However, the topics contained in this book would not make it suitable for a kid under the age of about 10 or 12.
B008JDAC7G|3.0|My son fell in love with this game on his aunt's Ipad.  When I saw it was available for the Kindle, I had to get it for him.  He's not as impressed with it on the smaller screen, but he still plays it.  Now there's a sequel for the Ipad, and that's all he wants.  Hopefully it will be available for Kindle soon!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a heavy duty (and heavy) knife with a quarter inch blade measured at the spine. If I had to choose one knife for use in a natural disaster, this would be the one. There are tons of reviews here and on YouTube, so I won't bother adding yet another. But I did want to address two issues.<br /><br />The blade edge came from the factory with an uneven grind. At the tip, the profile was more like a chisel edge, although it got centered as the edge approached the heel of the blade. The solution was simple. I reprofiled the edge using diamond stones followed by an Arkansas stone, and it's super sharp and centered now.<br /><br />The other issue you read about is the sheath. Some people report that the sheath dulls the blade as the knife is inserted and withdrawn. I haven't found this to be the case. It's possible that Becker has addressed this in newer production runs. I do agree that the flexible loop on the sheath is a bit too long, but there are lots of things that can be done to address this. Just check out YouTube for some ideas.<br /><br />I'm happy with the factory installed Grivory handle and probably won't replace it with Micarta. I will take the advice of others and use Loctite to secure the three bolts that fasten the handle to the tang.<br /><br />All in all, for the price you can't go wrong with this sturdy knife. Highly recommended.
B008I43DYU|5.0|has all i need for my calculations fun designs too wish they had more but not bad for.99 cents the paper one can be confusing they need like a spooky looking calc skin
B00846REIS|1.0|Giving this book a one star in a joke!!! I don't know how people can say this book is good!<br /><br />The writing was technically good but horribly vulgar! The story was just bad, it didn't flow or made any sense. Two people meet each other, screw their brains out and move in all in about a week. It is nothing but a really bad bad bad attempt to replicate Fifty Shades of Grey. It is just so bad that I cannot even describe it. The story is not realistic, not that Fifty Shades was very realistic but Fifty<br />Shades was classier and just flowed better, it made a little bit more sense than this one, and it left a lot more to the imagination than this book. Fifty Shades is an erotica novel in its best form, it allowed you to dream and to feel what the characters felt, but this book is just plain porn. I mean, it is so graphic and vulgar, and nasty, it just doesn't leave anything to the imagination and it leaves you with a dirty feeling (in a bad way).<br /><br />I will not recommend it to anyone and I will most likely not be buying the second book at all!
0061122416|4.0|Great I loved this book. It was more than I expected I could've read it in a day or 2 but I wanted the experience 2 last as long as possible
1439102813|5.0|A compelling story that is written intelligently and is well-researched.  Alice's downward spiral into dementia is portrayed with a great deal of compassion, but never dips into the maudlin.  This novels packs a whallop.
B00992CF6W|5.0|No crafting, no mobs, no picking anything up, no day and night. If I would have known I was buying creative mode I wouldn't have. just wasted 7 bucks<br />Update. This game is awesome and none of the ahove is true. Just noticed that you can just select it and you got it.
0525953728|5.0|Well written book that opens a window to the courageous men that form Seal Team Six. This is isn't just the story of one man but a group of people that go above and beyond to be the best.
B00371V6SE|5.0|I have read a few of Nicholas Sparks books but for me this was up there with the best. He has a way of drawing the reader in, and keeping their attention, This book held my attention from the first chapter, clearly written and intriguing, even though I had a pretty good idea of where the plot was going, I still really enjoyed the story and how it was told.<br />Logan Thiebault is a great romantic character and I really wanted him to find his way. His experiences as a marine and how that affected his life were well-told and this made him an easier character to understand. His dog Zeus was a nice addition to his story, the fact that the dog was truly his best friend was really endearing. I am delighted that I took the time to purchase and sit in comfort and read this one. This book kept me captivated for hours. I did see the movie when it was released as I had enjoyed the book so much. I would recommend you read the book its by far more enjoyable than the movie.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love big fish games and this was great.  well worth the price.  I can't wait for the next one.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Im not certain what mr. martin was thinking, book 3 was a real page turner but \\"A feast of crows\\" tends to go off the story as a whole and disappointed me.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The movie was \\"OK\\", but not worth the price for anything other than a Red Box rental.  As with anything she's in, Kristen Stewart was flat, and kept the same \\"I'm as empty-headed as a stump\\" look throughout the entire movie.  Seriously, she's not anywhere near pretty enough to make up for her utter lack of acting ability, so why do they keep casting her in roles?  Charlize Theron (as usual) nails her role, and you wind up seriously disliking her (as you're supposed to do).  Chris Hemsworth delivered a decent performance, but IMO no where near the quality of the work he did in Thor or The avengers.  Surprising cast of cameo actors thought, that part was nice.  Very nice special effects, but evan with as big of an \\"eye-candy\\" junkie as I am it still wasn't enough to push his movie past \\"OK\\".
B003YL4LYI|2.0|once again mr martin has strayed off the story and \\"A dance of dragons\\" was a disappointment.  I had been waiting for some closure. Where is the war that was due? what happened to those characters we fell in love with in westeros?? book 4 went over the cliff and book 5 hit rock bottom.<br /><br />Please Mr. Martin get back in the groove, take us back to westerow and finish what was a stunning, colorful, whole heeated story so many of us fell in love with
B001EBWING|5.0|The nuances of the dialogue are what I love most about this film. It's hard to get people who haven't seen it to sit down and actively listen. Some of the references are lost on people who don't know basic history of the 20th century.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|book 3 is a killer!!! everything in the first 2 books seemed to be leading up to this explosive episode, \\"A storm of swords\\" is the best of the series without question
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The Avengers is just great, the fact that Marvel decided to do something no other production could or would do. They made movies with their characters individually and linked them all together in one continuity, before all superhero characters in movies were in their own self contained universe. Warner who owns DC comics did this as well, even though they own the rights. You would think having all these characters together in one movie and give them all enough screen time would be hard, but Whedon who is a comic book fan pulls it off..<br /><br />The movie has great action, humor and looks great, I would recommend seeing all the other movies first if you haven't yet. Iron Man,The Incredible Hulk,Thor and Captain America in order. Even if your not a comic book fan I think your going to enjoy this film.<br /><br />I only had two complaints with Avengers.<br />1.Them replacing Ed Norton with Mark Ruffalo, granted Ruffalo did a great job in the role, I just always had a pet peeve when Hollywood replaces main actors with someone different in sequels etc. For me it just messes with the flow,especially if they look nothing alike, again it is a minor complaint when you see how great the movie is it works.<br /><br />2. There is a deleted scene with Captain America/Steve Rogers, I wish they would have left in the movie, it worked well with the character trying to adjust to modern times, and it explained a question I had about a minor talking part character toward the end of the movie. In the theatre I thought she appeared quite a bit in some scenes at the end and didn't know why. The deleted scene answered the question for me.<br /><br />The movie on Blu ray looks great, and was an excellent transfer. I loved the extras and was worth the purchase.<br /><br />In closing if you haven't seen this movie yet, I would highly recommend seeing it, even if your not in to superheroes, and again as I said before seeing the previous movies would help a lot, granted you don't have to watch them to enjoy The Avengers, but it would help greatly in understanding the characters and how the team was brought together.ch them to enjoy The Avengers, but it would help greatly in understanding the characters and how the team was brought together.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A quick 1 day read, that really starts a bit on the corny side. It did however keep just enough of my interest so that when I got to the intent/purpose/message Albom had to share, I was glad that I had not put it down. In today's fast paced world, I think everyone needs to consider the value of time and appreciate all they have.  I have recommended it to 3 others who enjoyed it too.  It's a buy 1, pass it around book....share a tear with a freind.
B0071T4BVC|5.0|I can't get enough of this music. Paul McCartney just gets better and better. I highly recommend this to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series brings all the key elements of a good series into one story. Great battles, enthralling mystery about who can be trusted and who cant, but most of all a love that seemed doomed yet prevailed . The struggle to come back from the brink of complete and utter emotional insanity. This is by far the best book ive read thus far. the only part i dont like is that it had to come to an end.
B0000A2I1B|5.0|I am a big Santana fan, yet needed to update my catalog and replace some old cassettes with CDs. As I was going through the Santana catalog I came across this Title that I was unfamiliar with and figured, what the heck it's Santana so it has to be good. I was very pleasantly surprised. This CD is more jazz than many of his that you will find. Primarily instrumental with the jazz,afro-cuban fusion brought about by the outstanding percussion work. This has become one of my favorites and the more I listen to it the more I hear and the more I like.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It awesome.I do not know some thing better than this can this be any better this is awesome keep reading
0525953728|5.0|A great read for anyone that lived a simular military career.  This also gives a generalized idea to non-SOC personnel and civilians alike of how this life takes a toll on the families and the operator.  Great job and great read!
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I like this app. only wish that I could use it in conjunction with the other app I have from this company. when I bought it I thought it was an upgrade not a separate app. the only other thing I don't like is that the volume controls don't work the way I would really like them to.
0345803485|1.0|The writing is so bad, I can't believe one book was published, let alone 3 of them.  The author doesn't seem to know more than 10 different verbs and adjectives to describe the characters actions.  The repetition is unbelievable. One of the reviewers actually counted the number of times certain words were used!  The plot is basically a teen fantasy...  Virgin girl marries filthy rich Mr. Perfect, has 2 children and lives happily ever after.  Really, did the editor/publisher actually read this before printing it!?!
B005LAIHPY|4.0|we found this movie to be interesting, the video effects were quite good.  A friend of ours had the game pack and told us we would not be disappointed in the movie.  Quite right -  the actors were great, had fun trying to remember what other parts we had seen them in.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Had great time playing this game. Didn't have any glitches.  Great way to pass some time. Can't. wait for the next one.

B007Z9QWVK|5.0|W.E. was a wonderful movie. Madonna you rock! The casting was perfect. Oscar Isaac & Abbie Cornish were so much fun to watch. I loved the music so much, I bought the sound track too.

B008ALA6DW|4.0|Good product -- I like having a wired connection since WiFi can be spotty at school. WiFi is good and abundant, but sometimes you do need the Gigabit speeds for LAN data transfers and the like.<br /><br />The adapter is easy to carry - just throw it into one of your laptop bag's pockets. My only problem with it is that since it uses the design of the Thunderbolt plug, it is incredibly easy to pull it out by simply lifting your laptop, rendering the snapping lock on the Ethernet plug useless.  Not so great in the middle of a large file transfer. >_<<br /><br />Overall very useful for those times when you just don't have a good WiFi signal, when you need to make a large file transfer between two computers, or for just faster, more reliable Internet speeds.<br /><br />Also worth noting for some, it seems the MAC address is associated with this adapter.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Like the title says, its definitely a twist into a darker path. But somehow I ended up really liking it. There is no way in hell i would have believed the survivors and districts would have lived completely happily ever after, and this book made sure it took a realistic approach. I will admit the ending was not satisfying, but I never really read the books to see who see who or why she hooked up with so all is good and i give this a solid five stars.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|OK, but not one of Child's best.  Have read them all, but this one was a bit \\"ho hum\\"  Read it, but don't expect too much.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|My wife, though not a big chick-flick junky, LOVES this movie. I must admit that I also really enjoyed watching it too. Very creative and yet not overly done.
B002DQHQQU|5.0|First off I'm a huge Wilco fan so I might be a bit biased but this album is really good. 4.5 Star album for sure. Only missing a 1/2 star because it might or might not make the 10 albums on deserted island story, which of course should all be 5 Star albums.<br /><br />For those that aren't sure about buying this album, this album will not disappoint.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book describes a strange relationship between a young innocent girl and a troubled businessman.  The characters seem unrealistic and unbelievable.  The book focuses too much on the sex (almost pornographic) rather than the relationship.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|The Hunger Games movie is great. I can't wait to read the books. I feel like I'll be watching this movie a lot.
0062011847|3.0|For me the last good Discworld novel was Thud! (not counting the childrens books). From there on something changed. I really suspect the books are ghost written to a large degree. Just too much has changed. The characters have evolved into something unrecognizable and are becoming cliche's. Vimes was a great character but he's become, well, annoying and self-righteous to a degree i cannot handle. Vetinari (one of my favorites) has become one of those cold on the outside but with a heart of gold type people and its driving me insane. But still i could live through it, if it wasn't for one thing... The world, as in Discworld, doesn't matter anymore. It's hard for me to articulate what i mean, but here goes. From the first novel on Discworld was a crazy place where you had trolls, dwarves, wizards, witches, talking swords, parallel dimensions with Elves, Hero's etc. Just insane stuff. And more recent the books get, the more this is pushed into the background. If you look at Unseen Academicals (the worst book of the DW series IMO), its basically a book about the invention of football and it doesn't matter where it takes place. It could have happened in Narnia or Middle-Earth or wherever. There are some old names thrown in with completely changed personalities, but in the end its not Discworld anymore. The best example of this would be the lack of Death. In older books the baddy died and even if it was all serious there was Death with a comment or something similar.<br /><br />Now this one isn't so bad as UA, its a decent read, but i struggled with it. It's a mystery story with acceptance crap thrown in where Discworld as a fantasy realm is pushed into the background. It could have all happened in rural England with a few tiny changes. Also the plot has kinda been done before. Not to go into details but its about accepting other beings etc. which has all been done a couple of times in the Watch series (not to mention the goddamn UA). Its what the Watch series is basically about, the whole accepting Trolls, Dwarves etc into the Watch. So yeah, nothing new there. It has just become...bland. If you compare this with Twoflower in the first book (which isn't my favorite), him being the first Turist it's just miles away. There are less and less laugh out loud moments and its all a bit dark (Night Watch was also but there it worked). Also if i read another Vimes \\"what it means to be a copper\\" monologue im going to scream....

B0056BMK6K|3.0|The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly!<br /><br />This book is worth reading, but should be read with hip waders on. Locke is a pioneer in eBook publishing and has sold 1.1 million books. But he puts in so much filler into his 170 book, that I could delete 100 pages and not miss a thing. Kind of like the Amazing 10 in 1 Can Opener, you get all this plus a load of fodder.<br /><br />Maybe other people have more patience than I do. There is just enough good advice that I suffered through the whole thing. [[ASIN:B0056BMK6K How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months!]]
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Nothing beats the Sons of Anarchy.......wonderful movie I can't wait for the 5th season!!!  Once you watch you can't stop.............
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great book. It was entertaining and a good account of the plan to get UBL. The photos of his gear was a huge surprise and I loved researching them afterwards.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|it's a fun app, but for some reason it began to glitch to where I couldn't see what anyone was drawing...
0345803493|5.0|I sent this series as a gift and got lots of good feedback. I lost interest in them myself and gifted the set to someone else. They just weren't my cup of tea....however very popular with others in my circle so I would recommend the series.
B0067EKY9K|4.0|I was drawn to this as a fly fisherman.  There are not many movies out there that represent the sport, with the exception of A River Runs Through It.  The acting is very well done in the movie.  The love story is predictable; girl gets man, girl loses man, girl gets men.  If you are looking for a nice movie with good acting and no political agenda, then I would recommend this one.  If you want action and blood/guts, give this one a pass.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Great film about Formula 1 legend Aryton Senna. I saw this at the movie theatre and enjoyed it so much I wanted to own it to watch again and to share with friends and family.
0316228532|2.0|I am very disappointed with this book.  I was not expecting anything like Harry Potter but I at least expected the story line to be readable and to keep my interest.  I am trying to find some redeeming qualities and cannot.  I will hope, if she writes another ADULT book it has a lot more to offer her readers.
B007PVHANM|5.0|This film about Reggae legend Bob Marley is great ! I saw it when it played at the movie theatre and enjoyed it so much I had to purchase it to view again and share with friends and family.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is addictive and fast paced.  Play through the levels or when you have a few minutes you need to kill.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I didn't find it necessary to remake the Millennium series so quickly after it came out in Sweden, but I think David Fincher did a great job, as usual. I can't complain about the acting or the cinematography (as usual it looks great like all of Fincher's movies) or anything really except for the opening credits with the terrible Trent Reznor song that plays out like a bad opening for a James Bond movie that doesn't fit the look and feel of the movie at all. If you can manage to get through the terrible opening (which I almost didn't) then you will probably enjoy the movie just fine. Trent butchers Led Zeppelins \\"Immigrant Song\\" for the opening title sequence and then Bryan Ferry's \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\" at the ending credits (this song you may recognize from Tangerine Dream's score for the end credits of Ridley Scott's 1985 fantasy film, Legend). The music in the movie is fine, but the terrible opening and ending song started with me feeling annoyed and upon ending left me feeling annoyed. Trent Reznor made better music when he was on heroin and shouldn't be molesting other peoples songs and if he does, they certainly shouldn't be used in such a way. I know it seems like a stupid thing to complain about, but when the first thing you see and hear are flat out awful, it really takes you out of the film and does another wise  really great adaptation, a huge disservice. If you liked the original then you'll like this, if you like David Fincher movies like Seven or Fight Club, then you'll like this. This movie looks immaculate on Blu-Ray, has tons of special features and is well worth the money. Also, lots of good female nudity which is always a plus in my book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games aren't the best quality. but its a free app so its pretty good. good app if u want something to do and not pay anything
B007C4ZJ3K|5.0|This movie should have a way better rating than it does on here. People giving this film negative reviews are simply people who don't get the movie and subscribe to mindless fodder like the Fast and the Furious franchise and Top Gun to get their action movie fix. This film is paced like an actual film and not some s&%@ action movie with a bunch of close shots of people fighting hand to hand with quick cuts and edits. What Ronin did with car chases, this movie does with hand to hand fight scenes. The plot lays on a bit thick and does not cater to people who aren't paying attention, no one over acts and Gina Carano isn't the terrible actress people make her out to be. If you can sit through Jessica Alba or Angelina Jolie, then you shouldn't complain about Gina. The music is in the vein of Lalo Schifrin (Bullit, Enter the Dragon) with a very 1970's style score which really adds to the movie. It's shot with digital cameras which allowed for the film to be shot without artificial light which adds to the very cool aesthetic and look of the lighting for the film. While there isn't a fight scene every ten minutes, when they do happen they hit hard and are brutal. This isn't a movie, this is a film, it feels foreign and since it's shot mostly overseas it looks foreign. If you like most of the generic Jason Statham action movies that come out yearly (not counting the 1st Transporter because that movie was awesome and I like Jason Statham) or any of the Fast and Furious movies, you won't like this movie most likely. If you like Ronin, Munich, or any other smart action films that are shot well and in other countries, then you'll probably like this movie just fine.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So much cool stuff on this site!!!!  Everything from recipes to style,  DIY info &amp; hair&amp; nail styles too. Very addictive!!!
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Joe Johnston (director) has worked on some of my favorite movies and directed one of my favorite movies and this just didn't live up to my expectations. Granted it's better than a lot of the other \\"comic book movies\\" I've watched over the years, but still not a great movie. Joe Johnston started his career in film working on effects for Empire and Raiders and ended up directing the Rocketeer (a far better comic book movie than this) and didn't do too much else through the rest of the `90's and `00's. I thought he was a great choice to helm this franchise seeing as how he has already tackled a comic book movie from the same genre. But this movie is flat in dialogue and story, the effects are well done but the art design seems boring and border line generic. I wanted to like this movie more than I did, but I can't like it for what I wanted it to be, I can only kind of like it for what it is. I can't complain about the acting or music or pacing, just that it seems to be lacking depth and heart. The extra features are on the weak side. This movie looks great on Blu-Ray, it's sharp and has great detail. If you love The Rocketeer, or Indian Jones or good comic book movies like Batman (1989), The Avengers and Ironman, this movie may seem a bit disappointing. If you liked Thor or any of the Fantastic 4 movies, then you'll probably like this movie a lot.
0984183523|5.0|This is a great book for those that want to ace case interviews for one reason. In addition to explaining the basics of case interviews, Victor helps you UNDERSTAND the actual purpose of the interviews. This is extremely important because if you are smart enough to eventually work for a top consulting firm, you are probably also smart enough to know that truly understanding the case interviews, and what they are looking for, is the best way to perform well during the interview.<br /><br />After going through the long process of research case interviews, practicing them with classmates, doing them in live interviews, and receiving a couple of offers from inhouse consulting firms, I can say that everything that Victor mentions is completely spot on. I've also used other books and websites and they were helpful to see a different perspective but Victor's info was the most accurate.

1616614609|5.0|Fantasy Flight Games have gradually been releasing card games that follow a concept they call Living Card Game (LCG). This is opposed to the more common Collectible Card Game (CCG), of which Magic: The Gathering is the best known example. Android: Netrunner is an example of a LCG. The advantage of LCG's over CCG's is that there's no need to invest a lot of money to get a good deck. The basic set is highly competitive, and there's no randomization in expansion packs. This review is for the basic Android: Netrunner set.<br /><br />This game is set in a Cyberpunk future. In fact, it's based on a 1980's roleplaying game [[ASIN:0937279137 Cyberpunk 2020: The Roleplaying Game of the Dark Future]].<br /><br />One player plays a Corporation, and one player plays a Runner. This is called \\"asymmetrical\\" play. The objective of the Corp is to complete Agendas. The Runner's job is to steal them before completion. The Corp wins if all the Agendas are completed or if the Runner loses all his cards -- \\"flatlines,\\" in game parlance. The Runner wins when he steals all the Agendas, or if the Corp loses all its cards.<br /><br />The Agendas are held on Servers protected by \\"Ice\\" -- security countermeasures. These can be harmful or lethal to the Runner. Usually, a Runner can only disable one or a few instances of Ice, so he'll usually take some damage (lose cards) during a \\"Run.\\" If he makes it past the ice alive, he may discover Assets, and he may discover Upgrades which add to his abilities. However, some Assets are actually traps which will cause trouble if accessed.<br /><br />Adding to the game's variety are Factions -- every player, Runner or Corp, belongs to one. Each faction has certain useful and proprietary cards. These are bought at the beginning with \\"Influence\\" points. Each costs from 1-6 points. Players start out with 15 Influence points.<br /><br />The game takes time to learn, but it's a lot less complex than Magic: The Gathering. Because it's a LCG, the initial expenditure to have a competitive deck is much less. So that makes it more newbie-friendly than Magic. It's an excellent game, with extensive replayability. The addition of expansion packs will further increase its longevity -- again at a far more reasonable price than for Magic. The game's graphics are excellent -- neon and noir -- done in exciting comic-book style.<br /><br />Also check out the related game [[ASIN:1616613963 Infiltration]].

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The Misremembered Man was a very good read. The story shows how everyone has so much to deal with that may not always be evident to others.  The main characters are drawn to each other, but for reasons are are unknown even to them.  I would recommend this book to everyone who likes to read about real characters and how they cope with what life has for them.
B003E8P9G0|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book after reading the heros of olympus and the percy jackson series but rick really let me down on this one. Every chapter was the same they fight a monster get tired  use the last of thier strength to summon a portal and repet the process really boring.
141690977X|5.0|This book is a must read for any woman who is dating or thinking about dating.  It will shatter all the mind games that you play with yourself holding out hope for \\"Mr. Perfect\\".  It will give you hope that he is out there but that you don't need to make excuses and drive yourself crazy over a guy who is \\"no that into you\\".  Move on and find the guy who thinks you are awesome! It is a funny, quick and informative read.
B00913DPW2|4.0|Great game.  Enjoyed playing this game with my 12 yr old.  I liked have the hints readily available when needed.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great story of the training and toughness of the Seals.  Nice to know more about the guys protecting us and their readiness.  He did a good job of describing the teams and their lives.  There were no real secrets revealed: nothing that I hadn't read elsewhere.  I guess the use of Infrared light sticks to mark clear areas was new to me, but hardly worth the fuss some government agencies have made.  Worth the time to read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is the best I have ever read. I am not a huge reader but I finished this book, then the second and working on the third. I could read it over and over again . Christian Grey is every woman's sexual,emotional,and semi-finding  fantasy whether they know it or not.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Best movie e<br />ver! It had so much action and a little romance. I absolutely love this movie. I love CHRIS HEMSWORTH!!! :)
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|We saw this movie in 3D at the theaters.  It was awesome.  So we quickly purchased the 3D Blu Ray.  It was even better in our living room.  I highly suggest anyone with 3D check out this movie.  Worth much more than we paid!
B0098VXE50|4.0|This is a really good movie, but too long. A half hour could have been cut out. That's just my preference though, I don't care for movies to be more than 90 minutes. Overall good entertainment though!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed reading all three books. I felt each book had its own differences. The third one (freed) I felt had a good plot but was a little repetitive and predictable. However I did enjoy all three books.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Too many swear words. I read for 15 minutes and encountered 3 swear words. I stopped reading it and digitally returned it to Amazon Kindle for a refund due to \\"offensive content.\\" If it woudn't have included the swear words, I'd have continued, even though I was very bored, just because I love the Harry Potter books and have faith in the author. I don't read books with swear words.

B005FITIGO|1.0|What we should be pondering aren't the merits or flaws of such time-wasting fare as Margin Call, but if all the positive reviews here on amazon aren't perhaps a signal of the coming apocalypse.  Surely, Margin Call receiving even one 5 star rating is cause for alarm.<br /><br />Wow, was this awful.  My wife and I watched this on-demand a few nights ago.  It was a slow, vague, thrill-less, stupid docu-drama about an anonymous uber-company passing the financial buck around 2008.  I realized that it was probably going to suck about 20 minutes in.  The film just had no center.  No real reason to exist outside the fact that this crappy stuff happened and a few people would definitely watch it if such a film was made.  An hour in, I knew I had to review it on amazon, warning others of the danger.  At that point, I felt sorry for the actors.  What could they have done with such a terrible script and, probably, director?  Not much, apparently.<br /><br />Margin Call is just-how-bad-can-this-thing-get worthy.  On the bright side, maybe the next generation can make a drinking game out of it.  When an actor says something dumb, pointless, or hopelessly contrived - drink!<br /><br />My wife said it wasn't all that bad.  But then, of course, she said the exact same thing about the turd Wallstreet 2: Money Never Sleeps.<br /><br />Awake!<br /><br />Venger As'Nas Satanis<br />Ipsissimus<br />Cult of Cthulhu
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Read this book in 3 hours. Yes, there was a moral to this story, but if it had not been a short read, I don't know if I would have bothered. It was fair and passed the time when TV was lousy, so yes, I was entertained for 3 hours. Just isn't a prize winner!
B008J34466|5.0|I instantly loved this CD.  With each new song, I thought \\"No, THIS is my favorite!\\"  P!nk never disappoints & I can't wait to see her perform these songs live - I already have my tickets.<br /><br />BTW, there's cursing.  A lot of it.  So what.  She's a rock star.

1603429999|5.0|This book is a wonderful resource for knitters of all levels.  The author provides detailed information and the illustrations are very helpful.  This is NOT a book of patterns and the samples that she provides are small.  Her goal is to teach techniques that you can transfer to projects, not to provide them.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator!  Very easy to use and big enough for older eyes.  Love it.  Just another reason to love my Kindle Fire.
0316228532|2.0|While one should admire J. K. Rowling for trying to reach an adult audience, one must also retain relevant critical faculties; in this case A Casual Vacancy is embarrassingly awful. The characters are nearly interchangeable, the language is movie language (f*** with far too much regularity), and the characters are unsympathetic to distressingly negative. This appears to be naturalism to its NTH degree. Such wallowing in lower class society is not what this reader desires. He still believes literature ought to be enriching, elevating, and enlightening.<br /><br />Certainly NOT recommended.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Worth reading with a surprising ending  you will not see coming.  not for those who crave a happy ending though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this game, it's awesome! But the problem is that this isn't the survival mode. And they should also put some animals in it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I liket the book but he should have wated till he got the ok from the Gov. He may have put other Seals in danger by telling how they do there jobs.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|With some assistance, I downloaded this as my first app on my Kindle Fire.  Both my husband and I have played it many times since, having to repeat certain levels many times before passing it.  It has been challenging and fun and we are still not through all the games yet.  It is great for all ages and is just good clean fun.
0525952926|3.0|Let me start this by saying I having been reading Follett for years.  The first book of this series, \\"Fall of Giants\\", was everything I have come to expect from this author.  The character development was stellar, the research was obviously extensive, the writing was tight, all and all a very good book.<br /><br />This book, although still a very good story, was not up to the standard I have come to expect from Follett.  The characters, now the next generation, were not well developed.  You were never really made to care for them as people, not at all like the first book.  The previous generation was shuttled aside with just a brief synopsis of what had come to pass during the bridge between the two books.  Sections felt hurried and decidedly skimmed over.  The new characters were, for the most part, barely two dimensional.  You were being told a story about them, but not really a story told through their eyes.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert*** For the most part, I also didn't feel that the characters actions were realistic and were never fleshed out as they could have been. Daisy's dealings with Boy's infidelity is an example.  The section dealing with Carla's rape and subsequent pregnancy, at the very least, I found it offensive and insensitive. JoAnne's death or the relationship between Chuck and Eddy are more of the same, I could go on an on.<br /><br />I would have rather waited a few more months (or longer) to have gotten a book that was the caliber Follett is capable of writing.
0307950689|5.0|Dan Brown has written another solid book, obviously similar to many of his other books, but it didn't disappoint.  If you enjoyed Angels & Demons or Da Vinci Code, this is another solid thriller starring Robert Langdon.
B00846REIS|1.0|Did she try to copy fifty shades of grey or what? It lacks originality.  Her characters and plot are cliché.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is excellent. Worth so much more than I paid for it! I cant wait for enigmatis 2! I'm just sad its over!
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|The music was not up to the perfection standards that I expect from Andrew Lloyd Webber.<br /><br />The story was weak and did not flow. I had to struggle with what the real story was as I watched it the first time.<br />Slowly the first scenes begin to make sense as the musical progresses.<br />The end...watch it and find out.<br /><br />This musical had one beautiful scene and music with the Phantom interacting with Christine's son. This was the highlight of the musical.<br /><br />Most of the characters from the Original Phantom are in this musical. They have the same names but do not carry the emotions nor any relationships with each other as seen in the original Phantom.<br />I had a hard time trying to resolve the complete changes in their character. Their changes can somewhat be understood if you try. Christine is the key to these changes.<br /><br />Watch it once to start down the road to enjoying it. By the forth viewing you just might really enjoy it.<br /><br />If you are expecting it to be what the original Phantom was...forget it...
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the craft ideas and the funny photos!! such a great app so easy to use and so much fun!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Finally the Phantom with correct makeup.<br /><br />More than a few bows at the finale. The finale was worth more than the price of this DVD. Buy it and enjoy.<br /><br />In fact enjoy this stage production...perfection.<br /><br />If you are a Phantom fan this DVD is a MUST for your collection.

0061124958|5.0|Great book.  I see us reading this book over and over. I remember reading this as a child and I hope that my daughter will enjoy it just like I did.
B004G606K8|5.0|Love it. Can't put it down. A must read. Great character development an quick paced. Tanis is a great leader.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It kept turning pages.  I still think about the story even after I have read it.  Great story. It me be surprised how much I would enjoy it.  More than just a sex novel but it had mystery and completely engaged the reader.
0553807919|3.0|As someone who works in child development, I think the underlying ideas of teaching children mindfulness skills and helping them learn about how their brain works are both incredibly important. Research has shown us again and again that this can help children improve how they handle their emotions, control impulses, understand consequences, and get along with others -- and in turn, these skills have a much bigger impact on school and life success than how early a child learns their ABCs.<br /><br />That said, I'm really not confident that this book will help most families get there, for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) Because of the organization of the book, parents need to wade through a lot of content that just isn't relevant to their lives to get to the scattered bits that will be useful right now.<br /><br />2) The authors have a metaphor that they use for each key point, and often seem to overemphasize the metaphor to the point where it overshadows the actual skill. If the metaphor happens to \\"click\\" for you and your family, that probably won't be a problem -- but the thing with metaphors like these is that they are almost never one size fits all. Because more time is often spent on the metaphor than the meat, the book assumes that you will make connections that may or may not happen for you.<br /><br />3) While the concepts of mindfulness as they relate to child cognitive and emotional development are definitely valid, the authors have not done a great job of explaining the science behind this. There is a lot of oversimplification and over-reliance on metaphors, no references cited, and illustrations that are unprofessional and sometimes just confusing. If you're just looking for the skills, that may not matter. But if you want to be convinced that this is the real deal -- or you have a partner that needs to be convinced -- I'm not confident that this book will do that for you.
B0087HT36U|4.0|it was a very fun ga.me. my grandson is three and really has a joy playing it I want more

B0087HT36U|5.0|This is a great little game of strategy and physics! It's a fun time waster and stress reliever. It's along the lines of Angry Birds, but with a different twist.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|This fits the iPhone 4S perfectly and looks decent. It's not hard plastic, so I'm not entirely sure how well it will protect the phone if I drop it...hopefully I'll never test it out. The screen protector went on easy and seemed to just melt into the phone. Without looking at the edges you can't even tell there's a film on there. Overall very happy with this purchase, the price can't be beat.
B007KDFWRG|3.0|First of all, I love everything that the Derek Trucks Band has recorded thus far, and I'm a fan of Susan Tedeschi too. Enjoyed their last album together very much. Thus, I had very high hopes for this album. But I have to be honest and say I'm  a bit disappointed with this newest Live album. I suppose I shouldn't quibble about quality, but these folks have set the standard so high by recording such outstanding previous albums that I felt this live set could have been much stronger. No doubt you get a lot of music on here, and for a 2-CD set the price is very fair. One reviewer raved about this album and it's improvised jamming. Well, that's probably what tended to annoy me the most. I realize that we're talking about an outstanding group of musicians who like to stretch out in concert and not repeat the same licks that they played on the studio album. That said, it feels like there are TOO MANY loose and improvised jam bits, so many that I started thinking of the Grateful Dead and their old trick of napping in the middle of a long jam. Hey, wake up dude, the drum solo is almost finished! Perhaps I'm being too critical, because many of the tracks on here are actually quite good and Susan's vocals are strong and powerful. I'm no diehard audiophile, but I'd also agree with the reviewer that was less than impressed with the sound quality on this recording. To my ears, a few too many muddy passages, plus some songs didn't end as much as they withered away. Plus, the  pacing of other songs was odd. It's pretty hard to record a dull and uninspired version of \\"Wade in the Water,\\" but the version on this album qualifies as such. Obviously, many of the other fans love this live set, and I'm not going to say they are wrong or missing something. We all hear something a little different at times. But there is no doubt that this is a great band. But for me this live recording was just not as exciting or dynamic as I had hoped for.
0312427646|5.0|With no preconceived idea of what to expect or even an inkling of what the book was about, I was hooked right away and stayed that way until the Queen's announcement on the last page. Truthfully, I wasn't really that keen on reading this slim little volume at first. I figured with a title like The Uncommon Reader, it was literally a \\"reader\\" filled with insightful essays. I was so wrong! It's one of those rare books that is both instuctional AND entertaining.<br /><br />The Uncommon Reader is about the Queen, the most uncommon person in England, and how she discovers the power of the written word. Her Majesty's foray into reading begins when she comes upon a van parked behind the palace. This is no ordinary van but  a traveling library stocked with books. She enters, meets Mr. Hutchings and a \\"thin ginger-haired young man in white overalls crouched in the aisle reading.\\" That day, she leaves with a couple of books, and later the thin young man, Norman, is promoted from working in the kitchen at the palace to becoming her amanuensis.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the plot so I'll just say that this wonderfully written book had me grinning and nodding in agreement from beginning to end. The Queen not only discovers that she loves reading (she takes books everywhere!), but she also begins to learn things about herself and other people. Although she becomes compassionate and sensitive, those around the Queen become increasingly disturbed about her behavior.<br /><br />The more she reads, the more the Queen takes notes and begins to think of writing her memoirs...something along the lines of Proust. Is it permissible for a monarch to publish a book? Read this book and find out for yourself.

B0015DROBO|5.0|Absolutely love this series! Admittedly it took me quite a while (maybe 80 pages) to get into the book and care about the characters, but once I did I was hooked! This author was brilliantly intelligent l. It's very disappointing that there will be no more from him. I very highly recommend! And don't give up on it too soon or because of too many details. If I can do it anyone can!!

B0055MI8K2|5.0|With flat and aging feet, shoes aren't always an easy find.  I hedged a bit on these but decided for them on a self-dare to buy a new concept.  I wasn't overly impressed at first as they didn't fit like I hoped and my first wear of them was out on the beach.  Don't wear them on the beach!!!  Getting sand between the straps and your skin sucks.  And when they get wet, they chafe even more.  But they do dry out very quickly when you finally get out of the water, and thinking about it only makes sense that everything has its place and the beach isn't for this product.<br /><br />After wearing them awhile, they have managed to conform to my feet in ways I could not have anticipated and are now the most comfortable thing I put on my feet.  For the first time in a long time, my feet don't hurt after an all day hike.  Having done some extensive walking tours including everything from mountain paths to city streets, I've come back to get a second pair before something happens and I can't get them anymore... that would be my luck.  Any sandal that can give top performance on old cobblestone streets, sidewalks, and dirt paths while rinsing clean by shaking them in a mountain stream is a product I can't pass up.<br /><br />About the only down side to these (other than not also being a beach shoe) is that the strapping can rub a bit in a day long hike.  What footwear can't you say that about.  The difference is that I never wear socks with these things, and I read in one of the views tonight that some people do.  So it's probably a pretty bold fashion statement and my daughter might not like it, but I may be giving that a try next time I'm in a situation that warrants it.<br /><br />Maybe they had problems with these at first or in the past, but I can't see it.  Thanks for a good product.
B004F27I3Q|5.0|The minute you listen to the opening track on Orchid's debut full-length album, you are instantly immersed in it. Capricorn, which clocks in at just about an hour of Sabbath-Style, psychedelic doom, is bound to take its listeners on quite the journey. There is no lack of head-bangin, thick guitar riffs, catchy vocal lines, rolling bass lines and solid drum grooves. Production of this album should be duly noted as it captures all the sounds, tones and nuances of a 70's-style album.<br /><br /> One might find it is best to experience this album on vinyl while chilling in front of two big ol' speakers from their stereo or grab it in a more compact form and crank this while driving at night down a dark, tree filled road trip out into the unknown.<br /><br />With a debut album that contains such hard-hitting, catchy, yet sophisticated tunes, it will be memorable and exciting for their audience to experience this band's as their sound evolves through the years.<br /><br />Here's a summary of the tracks with brief descriptions:<br /><br />Eyes Behind the Wall- The album opens with a song containing a classic, thick-sounding guitar riff, tight rhythm section and soaring vocals. Once the vocals come in, sit back and get ready for the ride.<br /><br />Capricorn-The title track kicks in with some great head banging hits before it slumps the listener into a slinky verse that is bound to make the user snap their neck back from the rhythm section's  hypnotic groove.<br /><br />Black Funeral- Opening with a nice warm bassline, \\"Black Funeral\\" is dark, psychedelic and mellow until about four minutes in where it slams into an ass kickin', rockin' outro.<br /><br />Master of it All- When exposed to this tune, one can hear that Orchid's songwriting is set out to keep the album fresh with various feels and lyrical content. The song is up-tempo, filled with a catchy chorus, and unleashes some killer guitar solos.<br /><br />Down into Earth- This sci-fi themed track opens up with a killer, wah-style bassline before it slams into an addictive groove that continues on through each chorus. Don't let the dark, dive-bomb backing guitar track during the guitar-solo make you beg for more because the solo then leads the listener into a vocal-filled, psychedelic spiral \\"Down into the Earth\\".<br /><br />He Who Walks Alone- Another great groove to reel in the listener and expose them to lyrics that one can only wonder when \\"He who walks alone\\" will come knocking at their door.<br /><br />Cosmonaut of Three- One of the tunes on this album that defines this band as a pillar in the stoner, doom metal community.<br /><br />Electric Father- Mellow, dark, with some great sounding synth and psychedelia. The vocals will keep the listener in anticipation for the next line as they learn of the \\"ever-watching eye\\".<br /><br />Albatross-Mellow, spacey, dark and mind-altering while waiting for the \\"Albatross\\" is always a great way to finish the book of Capricorn.

Well written, contained factual data and protected the identity of those involved. More than the White House can do.<br /><br />Get the book. You will enjoy it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Yes.  The ending was abrupt but, really, isn't that how it should be.  Completely engrossing.  Fascinating.  Written like a runaway train and just as thrilling.  Made you believe the unbelievable and sad when it came to the end.  Worth re-reading.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was well-written, and enjoyable to read.  It gives an eye-opening view of the life and training of the United State's elite forces, while remaining mostly non-political.  I read No Easy Day in only two days.  It was hard to put down.
B0088X7YMS|5.0|Over all a pretty good movie. Not an instant classic but what do you expect from a cartoon? This one is not for the kids. The anamiated nude scenes were creepy and made me uncomfortable. But I don't regret purchasing it.

0316228532|1.0|I read Harry Potter, but bought this with an open mind and not looking for an Adult Magical world, but what I go was garbage.  I rarely share my opinion of books, but wanted to warn readers to not waste their money on this book.  I was bored and the characters were flat and not written well.  Just save your money and buy something else.  I not only wish I could get my money back, but the time I wasted reading this.  Rowlings is good at writing Young Adult wizard novels and needs to find a new wizard to write about.
B009329ZF2|1.0|To put it simply, the movie plot sucks, it was very predictable and I'm glad i didn't spend $13 to go watch this. I would've been very upset with myself for doing so.
0525953728|5.0|This book rang with authenticity from the beginning to the end. The authors candid, short and sweet tale of his life leading up to the event was just what the story needed. It answered \\"Who is this guy?\\" It is a quick read & has been passed around to my family. None have been disappointed.

0439023513|2.0|I loved the first two books of the Hunger Games trilogy and had very high expectations for this one. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />The setting was very dull--of course I understand why, as District 12 is no more but even the whole setting and plot lines were very dull. There was not any action except at the end when I just really wanted to cry. Again, I understand the concept but I do feel that it could have been a little more exciting. The other nitpick I had was that no matter what Katniss did, she ended up getting wounded. Of course being in a battle and fighting the Capitol I do expect this but it was like every other page, she got hurt and was back in a hospital bed.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />The major disappointment? The fact that Katniss and Peeta get together at the end. I love how out of nowhere she falls for him; I ship Katniss/Gale. Katniss hasn't known Peeta as long as Gale and yet goes along with him... I do understand why since they were in the Hunger Games twice and survived. That would be a common thing of course and they can bond over that, but in my opinion her and Gale would have been perfect.<br /><br />Do you want to save yourself disappointment? Stop at the second book and make up your own ending; it's got to be better than this.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|So I think this game would be perfect. I paid 0.99 for 100 coins, but it's not on an nonlinear account so if something happens and I delete it from my kindle I lose what I paid real money for. On the other hand... you can play offline.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Interesting, heart-warming, realistic story of a man in his early 40's in rural Ireland in the 1930's.  Alternating chapters flash back to his horrid upbringing in a Catholic orphanage run by nuns, no less.  I recommend 'The Misremembered Man'; definitely a memorable read.
B003XYE7R2|4.0|I had never read any Arthur Conan Doyle before this, and the only problem I had with it was the Kindle version makes it hard to flip back and forth to see what you missed in previous pages.  The classic mystery and the good ol' Sherlock and Watson characters, combined with a dreary moor setting and wild ponies being sucked into a marsh, make this the best and most popular of all the Sherlock tales.
0525953728|5.0|This book is more than you hoped for. Very interesting reading and a real insight into the lives of Navy Seals everywhere.  You get a real feeling about how our government operates in the real world.  I very much recommend this book.
B001R10BMS|2.0|A mediocre movie.  The production values are poor, the lighting looks like a TV soap opera, Sean Connery phones in a flat performance, Barbara Carrera is laughable, the story jumps around, barely hanging together.  I give Kim Basinger credit for delivering a fairly dignified performance in the midst of disaster; Edward Fox, who is capable of a good dramatic performance, and whom I typically like, plays M as a clown.<br /><br />I'm content to own a copy, because it was the only Bond I didn't already have, but I don't know whether I'll ever bother to watch it again.
B0053O89KG|3.0|While I still enjoy some of the Castle shows, clearly something has been lost. The chemistry between Castle and Becket is still there, but his relationships between him and his daughter turned really strange. It was almost as if they couldn't decide if she was going to be a troublesome teen, or the same smart, loving daughter we've all come to know. I do think that Nathan Fillion should lose a few pounds for the show. They constantly hide him in black clothes, and it is a shame that he hasn't done a better job of keeping in shape. The supporting cast do a good job of keeping the show moving, although the new Captain is a bit too stereotypical.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Just good character development and an engrossing story with real good acting. Follows the books well. Good escapism time well spent
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Hotel Transylvania was a really good cartoon movie.  The movie is about a young vampire girl Mavis (Selena Gomez) who wants to go out and explore the world.  Her over protective father Dracula (Adam Sandler) does not want his young daughter to go out and mingle with humans.  He beleives that humans do not like vampires and will try to hurt her but he did tell her that when she turned 118, she could go.  The movie centers around Mavis's 118th birthday and her party.  All of her monster friends and relatives come to celebrate and they have an unexpected guest.....a human.  Mavis falls for the human and the rest as they say, is history.  The movie was cute and age appropriate.  I took my 5 year old to see this and did not cringe once.  She laughed her little head off.  I would see it again anytime.  I hope you find your Zing!
B008O69SZ0|5.0|As a fan of Ian's work since the first Mott The Hoople LP 43 years ago, I'm somewhat biased. However, this ranks as one of Mr. Hunter's best works. In fact, Ian has now released four incredible albums since 2001 (all SINCE turning 62 years old!!) and his songwriting is sharper than ever. If you thought insightful lyrics, hook-filled songs, and real musicians were a thing of the past, BUY this now! Simply outstanding!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This novel was even more enjoyable than \\"The 5 People You Meet in Heaven\\" (which I also recommend). This story transcends time, and really makes one consider the value we place on things and people. It is a story of deep and timeless love, a tale of personal discovery and triumph, a reconfirmation of the goodness in humanity. A Must-Read!

B008N5UX9M|4.0|Like everyone else, I was highly anticipating this album, and at first I was a little underwhelmed. Then as I listen to it a few times the songs really started to sink in like so many other albums that need a few listens to really get under your skin.<br /><br />The song writing is pretty awesome, the songs are catchy, the singing is a bit grating at first but then starts to rock, and there is plenty of diversity in the album. I can't wait to see these guys when they tour!
B004LROUNG|4.0|Very well written. Grisham now has a new fan. I felt like I was watching a Movie while reading! I appreciated the multiple storylines and great attention to detail. Overall, good read!

B006VGGAC4|5.0|I was a big Schwarzenegger fan through my college years, up until the time of the most recent revelations about his relationship with his housekeeper.  When I started reading this book last night, I was wondering if Arnold's ego would allow him to own up to his mistakes and, to a large extent, he does and I admire him for it.  In many ways, this is the typical immigrant narrative about having a dream and working hard to achieve it.  The stories of his early years growing up in post-war Europe stand out on account of what we would consider the abject poverty that he experienced, in a house with no running water or indoor plumbing.  I especially enjoyed his descriptions of his early business efforts, selling ice cream by the lake in the summer and ditching school to panhandle (resulting in a substantial beating when his father found out).<br />  Arnold admits the mistakes he made, but he doesn't come across as being terribly repentant.  He says he used steroids in his bodybuilding career because people didn't really know their dangers at the time.  Later in the book, he details some of his womanizing, but I have the sense that he rationalizes his behavior to a certain extent.  He seems sorry to have caused pain to his family but, as with all of his errors, seems almost comfortable in moving on with his life.  In some ways, I think this ability to compartmentalize negative experiences and move forward is one of the attributes that makes him so successful.<br />  For me, the overriding lesson in this book was that someone with a plan, the ability to analyze experiences and the motivation to work hard can become successful in just about anything he or she seeks to do, in spite of a lack of money or connections. With everyone telling him he'd never make it on account of his accent or his physique, he just powered on.  He got his business education and invested his money in distressed real estate, all while working on his training and pursuing a movie career.<br />  This book is often funny (see Arnold's brief tank driving career), but always interesting.  I'm glad I stayed up all night to read it. I'm not saying Arnie's a great guy, but I understand him better and that's the point of an autobiography from my standpoint.ook is often funny (see Arnold's brief tank driving career), but always interesting.

0547569653|3.0|I was interested in reading this book since I knew about Jurek from reading Born to Run and a feature article on him in Runners World. It is always interesting to see what fuels accomplished athletes to endure and succeed, and in this book Jurek writes about both his literal fuel (nutrition) and his mental motivation to win ultra marathons. It is part memoir, part training advice, and part cookbook. He recounts his childhood and high school years focusing on the effect of his mother's MS on the family. His telling of his life story is not comprehensive in a typical memoir way and deals mostly with the details of his athletic development and diet.<br /><br />If you are skeptical of meat free diets already, you will probably snicker at some of the recipes and and descriptions of food in the book. I am pretty open minded to vegetarianism, but still thought some of the ingredients in the recipes were pretty out there for regular folks. I laughed out loud when he wrote about switching to a raw diet and how the food was setting off explosions in his mouth. Yeah, I bet it was awesome.<br /><br />Also, if you think there has to be something just a little bit wrong with people who do extreme endurance sports, this book somewhat supports that belief. Jurek seems to be trying to run after something that he hasn't been able to catch just yet- some kind of spiritual balance. He briefly mentions marrying and divorcing his first wife in between drawn out descriptions of runs he took in the mountains and some pancakes he made one day, which I think probably clues you in to one of the reasons the relationship didn't work out.<br /><br />The book is definitely focused on running, the merits of a vegan diets, and how awesome Scott Jurek is for winning these races. After the initial chapters about his formative years, each chapter is basically about a different race he ran in. It is cool to hear about what the ultra running crowd is like and the kinds of conditions they run in. But I got bored after a while. It all started to seem a little self congratulatory. But I guess that's the whole point of the book. Overall, it was a quick somewhat interesting read, but I don't feel too much better for having read it. What I do carry away from it though is that it is possible to be a pretty impressive athlete on a vegan diet.ot bored after a while. It all started to seem a little self congratulatory.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had a Kindle 2 that I hadn't used in a few years and recently noticed that the external PVC coating on the cable had mostly fallen off.  I called Amazon and they immediately issued a credit for a new cable.  Once again I give them high marks for customer service.  The original cable was about 3 1/2 years old and obviously out of warranty.<br /><br />The problem with the old cable is that the PVC coating was defective.  The coating becomes brittle due to plasticizer migration from the material. This is pure and simple due to a quality control issue at the time of manufacture.

B0090EHVMC|5.0|I ordered the Lorax, DVD for my eight year old son.  We had intended to see it in the theatre, but somehow we missed it, so I was happy to purchase it once it came out on DVD.  We usually have \\"Movie Night\\" on Saturday and the first Saturday after the purchase we watched the Lorax.  I must say it is a wonderful, entertaining and very engaging.  My son loved it!!! As did I.  He has since watched the Lorax at least 10 more times.  The moral of the story was so relevant and substantial, but they got the message across in a \\"not in your face\\" manner.  I would recommend this movie to Dr Suess fans, children of all ages and anyone who is interesting in learning a little something, while enjoying spending quality time with their children.
0525953728|5.0|A great account of the killing of Obama Bin Laden but don't be fooled by the lame stream media, there were no national security secrets revealed; most of the information is available on the internet from White House sources.  The only thing I did not know was the layout of Obama Bin Laden's house.  Great read and proceeds go to a great cause so don't be cheap and get it from your library-buy the book.
B000W93CHC|5.0|The story, which picks up 200 years after Pillars of the Earth, shares none of the characters, a few of the relationships, and a setting which is only somewhat changed. Like Pillars, it's a fun read which leaves you with some good information in the field of medieval English history and architecture. By far the best that Follett has done, this series give you memorable characters, painted in delicious detail, living in an interesting time. Occasionally, Follet annoys me by flipping points of view too often. That aside, the characters, the story, the skill of the narrative and the lovely details thrown in make Pillars and World hard to put down.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Honestly, I had no idea what this game was or how to play it ... but the price was right. * free *  I think it took me all of 30 seconds to figure out how to play it. Now it's in my Favorites with a handful of other games I love.  Good going GameCircus!!!
1419702238|5.0|This series is hilarious.  This is my favorite of all of them.  I recommend this book to both children and adults.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Don't know what's wrong with all these 1 star reviews! I would give it 100 stars if I could. I was addicted, it was finished in 24 hours leaving me wanting more of their relationship! I must admit the ending wasn't amazing but still good! The whole book I loved, every page!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I Luv it. its just like Mario. very popular. adventorous. breath taking and worth the download. you'll never get bored. literally.
B007YOC4RW|5.0|Always enjoy his music. Personally I can't put him next to B.B. King or Clapton, but he is still amazing. Can't get enough.
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|This isn't the best show on tv but its decent entertainment. Its hardcore and I like that. The actors play there parts well. Katy Segal is a far cry from Peg Bundy in this. She's a tough old broad and trashy sexxy at the same time. If your into the biker world at all I think you will enjoy this. Real no, Entertaining yes :-)
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I love this app. I believe that I could give it a five star IF I could put my kindle on sleep mode and it still play, but it doesn't. which makes me very sad because I wanted to listen to the melodies while I do some yoga from an app on mu kindle. which you cant.
1446301583|5.0|Beautiful book with the cutest patterns.  I enjoyed making the circus animals and the bird cages.  It's also one of those books that inspire because the presentation of fabric, color and creative combinations.  Loved it, for sure collector quality also.
B0015AARJI|3.0|Thid controller was great for a day but soon after the L& R2 triggers stsrted sticking inside the controller. Not good in online gaming or in any regular game. So im not real happy with my transaction.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Book one was ok.  She had me with book two.  Book three was directionless and drifted.  Ended strangely.  It's like the author didn't know what to do with it.  If you've read the first two you probably need to finish the story.  But you will look forward to it being over.
030758836X|3.0|Psycho Amy is able to fool the FBI and every other law enforcement agency into believing she was held captive for almost a year at a lake house by a man captivated with her since their teen years. Common sense would dictate that evidence was present to prove she was there for only a short period of time no matter how cleverly she planted false clues.  Credit card application, orders, deliveries, and payments can be traced in the real world back to the originator. Duh.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|The Tedeschi Trucks Band rendition of Every Body's Talkin' will get you up off your seat and onto the dance floor. Its that good. Some of the performances were recorded at The Klein Auditorium on October 29, 2011 in Bridgeport,CT to which I had tickets but could not go due to a severe storm. Boy I really wish I had been there. Susan's singing is top notch.
B00846REIS|5.0|I must first start out by saying that I have an insane schedule with lots of driving.  With a husband, 2 kids, a full time job and other obligations, I don't really have time to sit down and read a book.  If I did, maybe my review would be different.  But I can tell you that I really loved listening to this audiobook while traveling (w/o the kiddies) & felt that the narrator was really Eva.  It was totally believable.  I was drawn to the main characaters, Eva & Gideon, from the start & based on the number of times I smiled during a traffic jam, or on the treadmill, or just listening alone while doing chores around the house, I can tell you it was money well spent.  It sure beat listening to bad news on the radio!  I also realize at my mature age that this book is based on a totally dysfunctional relationship between two people who require lots of therapy to get past their demons. I get that.  Young women reading this book need to get that to.  Fictional characters with these blatant flaws/quirks/dysfunctions are very romantic material, but, in reality, not always the best candidates for long term relationships. With that said, the author really made me care about the main & secondary characters, and I look forward to her second book in the crossfire series. I sure hope that the author sticks with the same narrator - Jill Redfield is awesome!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game is amazing and cute.<br />I love Hello Kitty so much!!<br />I think this game should have some way of us earning free points or money,  but other than that its awesome. :)
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Taken off guard by the story.  Written well for the adult reader to get attached then lost in its pages. 30-70 group. I will look for other stories by the author.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Superb.  This transfer is by far the best I have ever seen the movie look and sound.  In 5.2 it just blows me away.  I love the movie (yes, it IS a movie, folks, not factual, so get over the factual issues and just enjoy it for the entertainment that it is) and so does my wife.  One of, if not the, best films by Russell Crowe.  Enjoy.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This WONDERful book is among my favorites! Packed with humor, this WONDER shows that it is always NECESSARY to be KIND. Auggie's life has been unkind to him.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|One of the greatest albums of the later sixties and early seventies. Perhaps Janis at her best not withstanding live performance. Amazing that forty years after its production, it still moves the sole.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|It's Hemingway, so, of course, the prose is sparse and the sense of place is compelling. If only the characters had any redeeming social value!  Perhaps it's the times we live in, but I couldn't help wishing that these people would just shut up, sober up, stop whining and get a job!
B0087HT36U|4.0|I liked the game. it gets a lil repetative but its a lot of fun. good for kids too. wish there were more levels.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was hooked on this book from the beginning and surprisingly really enjoyed it as it wasn't my usual type of read.<br /><br />I decided to read the book before seeing the film and I'm glad I did because I don't think the movie does it justice.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the writing style and really enjoyed the concept of the brutal future society, however, I'm not sure I would be happy with my 10 year cousin reading it as I think some chapters are a little rough.<br /><br />Highly recommended but maybe for over 12 yrs!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I have rayman origins and it is so fun! I am riley looking forward to geting this game, and it has a very good price to!
0345803485|1.0|First of all...I \\"did not\\" buy these books...I repeat...\\"I Did Not Buy These Books\\"! Second...I rarely give such a detailed review on books because I don't usually like to spoil the story line...so I will do the best I can here!<br />I borrowed this series from a friend who just had to go out and buy all 3 books at one time thinking they would be all be fantastic...she was wrong...she got through about half of the first book before she became so completely bored she could not go any further...now she has a waiting list of borrowers, which I was among!  I can not be more sorry!!<br />I have never ever read such drivel in my life.  The 2 main characters are supposed to be college educated people but yet they seem to only be able to carry on the most asinine conversations I have ever read.  The female is supposed to be a Literary student about to graduate college yet she can not speak above a 6th grade level, speaks in idiotic sentences then ends about 95% of them with, what I call a $1,000.00 word that has no business being there...granted the meaning comes across but for the wording used, it is totally out of line and ridiculous to say the least!!  It seems all the two can discuss is this stupid contract for sex and it just goes round and round and comes out no where.  This girl...and I call her a girl because she acts like a 16 year old...a woman should know better!  This girl has no clue to anything about this man but the fact that she loves him deeply!  This super rich, super intelligent man knows exactly what he wants...a novice, an immature little moron,  whom he can control and manipulate  into doing exactly what \\"he wants\\" and she falls for it! This idiot girl goes from \\"crap\\" to \\"holy crap\\" to \\"holy shit\\" and does nothing but bite her lip!!  Then is surprised when she finds out, \\"he's not in love with her\\"!!  He doesn't want her for love...he wants to use a dummy and he sure got himself one. Not one time did this guy ever profess to even be fond of her!!  He's just there!!  This girl has no clue about anything, which is completely unbelievable...22 years old and never had a boyfriend, never been kissed, never had sex, never used a computer...what school did she go to and didn't she have any friends that she could at least get some \\"Tips\\" from through out her life?  What a pitiful person she is!!<br />The writing is so childish and pitiful to say the least!  The sex in this book is even boring!  All this guy wants this girl for is \\"to pleasure HIM\\" and nothing else, which he states profoundly,  until he gets tired of her!  Pages and pages are devoted to their conversations and it totally drove me crazy...why oh why can't these people say something to each other...anything constructive...anything at all!  The author can not even get her facts straight!!  Obviously she did no research into any thing for this book!  I have heard her say in an interview that this book was her secret fantasy....she must be an idiot too!!  I truly believe that these books were only published because her husband is a published writer and he \\"had them\\" published for her and that is the only reason I can think of that a reputable publishing company would even think of publishing such garbage!  This isn't even good eroticism period!!  I started the second of these books and was astounded by the fact that in the ending of the first book this girl had the good sense to finally  break up with this jerk of a guy...then suddenly she's accepting rides from him to a photography exhibit...by sending e-mails...this was never explained but in the end of the first book she \\"gave the computer back to him\\" then suddenly she is e-mailing him...from what?  This girl is stupid and immature to say the least and this guy has taken full advantage of it! This is a horrible example to set for today's youth!  I know that there are people who enjoy this sort of life style and that's fine with me...to each his or her own...but at least they should be adult about it..notsome simp acting teenage/woman who can't make up her mind for her life!  I can not understand why any one would find these books well written or even good or a good love story!  Maybe they have poor love lives or marriages or something but this is just a bad bad bad book and believe me I am not about to waist my time on any more of them!  I have read some Harlequin Romance Novels that have been really bad but were so much better than this piece of lousy work!!  I have also heard that this series of books is causing, of all things, a new baby boom!! Good grief some people must have really miserable lives to allow this junk to effect them!!  I feel sorry for those people!  I truly do!  This could have been a good story had it had much better research and writing!  I hope this woman author never writes another book!  This first one was bad enough to last a life time!  This one was so bad I read it in less than a day!  So if you are really looking for a quick read and a good laugh this series of books is for you.  If you are or consider yourself a half way intelligent person...stay away from them..big time!  They are an insult to any one's intelligence!! Or...don't tell any one you have read this junk!!  \\"Holy crap, this is bad\\"!!  I was so waiting to see the words...\\"Batman\\" after the \\"holy crap\\" statements!!  That was so disappointing too!! Jez, I'm disappointed!!some simp acting teenage/woman who can't make up her mind for her life!  I can not understand why any one would find these books well written or even good or a good love story!

B008BM9L72|5.0|These books are fantastic! I simply can't put it down. I read them every night before bed and whenever I get a chance throughout the day.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I don't quite understand all the noise this one made when it was published. I think the author has taken an interesting viewpoint in describing how the events in the book affects innocent Ana. I expected to be somewhat shocked by the book and its scenes. I was not shocked, but it did capture me, and I like it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is really nice. I got it for $95 and it is worth every dollar. The headset is really cool because you can change the options of the headset quite easily. Comes with DVD to install software. Overall this is a beast headset and I recommend buying it.
0525953728|5.0|Awesome story about brave, dedicated men and how the politics in our government sells them out.  God Bless Seal Team 6.  Thanks guys.
B0068FYZCA|5.0|Love this movie and ensemble cast. I think it speaks to the era of cruising, sock hops and hot rods.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Waste of money. We buy the original app and this should be included for free. They are greedy. If they must charge for this, and they shouldn't, 99 cents would be the best cost.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This really is a great game, I thoroughly injoy it, yes I would recommend it to the serious chess player
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I wish there were more games like this. I have really enjoyed the puzzles. I'm eagerlly awaiting more like this.
B005PK553C|5.0|This is quite literally the most intense, frightening, shocking, and provocative show I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. I bought the entire season and I've watched it twice already. Can't wait to recruit more people to watch season 2 with me!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Direct and fascinting view of the inner workings of the seals. Extremely impressive with their strength, focus and commitment.Just amazed they made it through training much less the raids they undertake
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love how it makes my kids think and work on their problem solving skills.  Great for my littlest one who is a non-reader still.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i recommend this app it is the most simplest calculator i have ever seenn it is easy to use especially for little kids and its friendly too! sooo fun i defintely recommend it
B006CUDDUG|5.0|Full disclosure: I'm a fan of John LeCarre's books. They are very well written and laden with characters that seem to be chiseled from reality. With that said, the reading experience is a little like watching Bittish teledramas on PBS - usually it takes me a little while to absorb the accent and get confortable with the flow of the piece, but once I'm there, I'm generally hooked on a good story.<br /><br />This is one that, for me, defines the genre and elevates the 'spy novel' to a treatise on the practice of intelligence gathering in practice during the cold war years. Coming in from the cold is a great read of a good, but now somewhat familiar story that connects the reader with not just the character, but with how the character thinks, then turns it all on its head.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good introduction to LeCarre's excellent collection of work, it is a good one. And if you're just looking for a well crafted story that reminds me of some of Conrads work, it will fill a long afternoon and evening with the kind of 'can't put it down' reading that's all to rare lately.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fascinating portrayal of a dystopian future where government rules over peoples‘ lives and children are forced to fight to the death.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like this app because it makes it easier for me to use pinterest on my kindle fire. That is all.
B000BYCAJE|1.0|The sound is NOT an improvement. Stick with your older copy and save your money.  Can not listen to this CD, it is just that bad. Tried to import into iTunes but the sound was just that bad.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its a good game just takes too long for energy to get back up unless you pay money good game
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Love the way the story is told via interviews. I thought that this type of story telling isn't captivating enough to hold the interest for long but I was wrong.<br /><br />Couldn't put this book down.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 days. I think I may be in love with Fifty!! LOL. I loved it!
0316228532|1.0|I dont understand the point of this book. It was filled with characters who were miserable. I had a hard time keeping up with all the characters thrown at you in the beginning. Very depressing. I love to read and escape, but this was just so dark and dirty. No one seems to learn their lessons. Maybe I am not looking \\"deep\\" enough. Also would not let a child or teenager read this. Very strong language, sex, drugs, rape and abuse.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Didn't enjoy it as much as the first, but a good read and temptation abounds to coax you into reading the third book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|if u don't like food porn, beautiful creations, silly humor, and inspirational quotes then you're lame and should not be o. pintrest.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter was a great action movie with fun storyline, solid acting, and great visual effects. Disney could have knocked it out of the park with this one if they had marketed correctly and picked a better release date. Buy it. You won't be disappointed.
B007TML4EI|5.0|Whether you are kid or an adult you will enjoy this game! It's difficulty varies and never seems to be too easy for even the novice.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I couldn't put it down.The only thing is the author put to much in the last few chapters. I think she could have made book 4 of it, but I loved it! I can't wait for book 4!!!!
034580404X|5.0|These books will bring light to a world that is so often left quiet. Thank you so much for giving us a series of books that may touch more people then ever known.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Ok so I own this game for both my Iphone 4S and Kindle Fire HD. This game is a whole lot of fun. It is highly addicting, has excellent game play, great sounds, very good controls, and a simple format and power up system that will keep you coming back for more. There is lots of missions to complete that are challenging and fun. The power ups you can buy in the game are also great and really add a different style to the game play depending upon what you have equipped. There are also in app purchases for real money... HOWEVER!! unlike other free games that pretty much require you to make expensive in app purchased to fully play the game as it is meant to be , this game does not require that. The in app purchases too are also very reasonable in terms of money vs content. I highly recommend you buy the in app purchases which will double your coins, and the 20,000 coin pack.. This will cost a total of 3 dollars and will help support the developer to make updates, I have bought both of these items on my phone and kindle because this game is that fun. I also forgot to mention the game has a nice touch of humor and there are many cool little details such as, when you buy the headphones for your character the games music becomes Dubstep, and if you purchase the characters dog and then decide not to play using him you will see lost dog posters through out the stage! again, its a really fun game that you will play through over and over. Its free so why not check it out! and if you like it try to make at least one in app purchase! it will only help us get more content! I hope this review helps
B009329ZF2|4.0|This movie is great if you are simply looking for mindless action packed full of special effects adventure movie. This is exactly what I expected and this is what I got. The movie loses its shine once a viewer starts taking it apart. The authors of the movie did not seem to concern themselves too much about laws of physics or other similar boring things (which is fine with me). I went for the movie looking for something that could help relax my overstressed mental functions and the movie did this job well. The special effects were great. I am not going to go into too much detail. But if you watch the trailer you will get an idea what I am talking about.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|This movie version of Cinderella is one of the better that is told in this medium.  It is basically fit for all ages.  I have watched it many times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I found Catching Fire to be an appropriate bridge between the first and third book in the Hunger Games trilogy. It continues the development of the characters and the world, and does so with the same engrossing writing that made Hunger Games such a wonderful story. I was somewhat disappointed by the very loose ending that left me ending, and the book, as a result, does not stand alone. Having read the Hunger Games trilogy, I also struggle with these books being considered books for teens. The darkness in the first book continues through both the second and third book, and actually becomes even darker. While a story that is worthwhile reading, I would reserve the books for older teens as a minimum starting age.
B007712XAU|1.0|Sold by Amazon. Just got to the 3rd. disc of Season 1 and it won't play.  Discs 1 and 2 were ok.  Have not checked Season 2 yet. Very disappointing.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Decided to read Cloud Atlas based on previous reviews and upcoming movie.  Could not put it down.  Written in a way that requires some effort on the reader--love that! Recommended to anyone who likes to read books that make you think.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book pretty much sums up what actually took place during the raid. Contrary to what government officials believe, the book told the story without giving away anything that we didn't already know. The SEALS are the real deal.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I was initially excited about the app for my Kindle Fire but I've noticed it freezes a lot.  it's. irritating to constantly reboot.
B008OW1S3O|4.0|I've been reading pitchfork for a few years now, and have recently realized something: albums that score between 4 and a 7 are fun.  That's not to say that the new Grizzly Bear isn't fantastic and enjoyable, because it is, and it received a 9.1.  That's also not to say that some of the low scores are undeserved, because many of them probably are. But what I've learned is that some of these low scores seem simply a result of too little experimentation on the part of the artist, and that some of these albums are quite enjoyable actually.  Most music on Pitchfork is worth checking out in all honesty, but these reviews that score somewhere between a 4 and 7 always seem to be a bit more accessible, catchy or \\"fun.\\"  With that said we may now release the pink elephant: An Awesome Wave received a pretty low score.  I used to just discount these low scored albums almost immediately, which is sad.  But I became curious, so I considered the possibility that this might be a really fun listen.  Of course I was right, and not only is it fun but also intensely beautiful.  Maybe this just isn't experimental enough for them, but it is gorgeous and interesting enough for me.  The instrumentation includes lots of keys, acoustic guitar, some electronics, etc.  The british accent rings through the vocals and is charming as hell.  The music has a dark edge to it, and the hooks are shamelessly catchy.  Guilty pleasure?  Absolutely not.  If you're interested in more accessible indie-rock, check this album out immediately.
1451648537|1.0|I was very much looking forward to reading Steve Jobs, by Walter Isaacson. I'd never read any of Mr. Isaacson's other books, but it seemed as though he was an accomplished writer, having tackled Einstein, Kissinger, Franklin, and so on. Very quickly, however, I realized that practically every page of Steve Jobs has at least one \\"huh?\\" moment, e.g., a sentence that looks like it belongs somewhere else, a reference to something that hasn't been said yet, and just plain awkward constructions all over the place. I'm thinking that this book must have been rushed to press after Jobs died to hit the market while it was hot; otherwise, there's no excuse for a book of this prominence not to have had a rigorous and thorough edit by a professional editor. On the plus side, Steve Jobs, the book, is impressively researched, but the organization and continuity problems, and the sloppy grammar and sentence construction render it a very tedious read. In fact, I'm putting it down after a hundred pages or so. Bad writing does not deserve to be read!
0525953728|5.0|This is a well written, engrossing book that opens a window to the courageous men that form Seal Team Six.
B008PZ69T8|1.0|I couldn't agree more with my colleague Spartro1.  In releasing a classical music album geared specifically towards a work of cheap fiction, EMI continues on an odious tradition that has always played some role in the big classical music recording industry- who hasn't seen similar compilations by EMI to commemorate a needless human sacrifice in Judea, or to promote some favored singer at the expense of presenting works of art as they were meant to be presented?  But, EMI has just shown that it is perfectly eager to descend even further down a commercial abyss, at the expense of classical music, ostensibly something that recording companies care about.<br />  Indeed, it is remarkable with what alacrity EMI has prostituted itself out to a shallow, vapid popular culture that thinks of classical music as some sort of mere palliative, a relief of the ennui induced by waits in elevators.  In catering to this nonsense, EMI has managed to maintain the serene dignity of a 40 year old former hipster going out to a night club, desperately trying to look cool.  The inevitable result typically ends with someone vomiting into a toilet bowl, and, in this case, the proceedings recorded on this CD fairly approximate that result.  Ironically enough, I sincerely doubt that those who read shallow bourgeoisie literature like this (sexually repressed middle-aged women whose sex lives are as exciting as those of monks) would even find most of this appealing.  After all, this music can at least pretend to possess a more intellectual veneer than garbage like this book, which would be a degree of erudition I doubt most of Ms. James readership would claim to posses.  All I can say of this abortion of a performance is that I hope that the meagre earnings EMI shall make from giving fellatio to capitalist banalities shall compensate for its complete loss of artistic merit.<br />  And, really, isn't this the point of it all?  What do the big recording companies even offer nowadays?  Haennsler, Naxos, Chandos, cpo, Pentatone, Profil (affiliated with Haennsler), and the in-house labels are all churning out incredible recordings of basic repertoire and modern performances that are ignored by the more commercial recording labels.  I hope that this can start a movement of sorts in our small community of classical music lovers.  Music is art, and great art at that.  Let us not cheapen it like this.  As a strategy to preserve great classical music, it is suicidal.  As a marketing strategy, it is doomed to failure.  If EMI would get off their craven posteriors, they would realize that intelligent marketing and fresh new recordings of both modern and traditional classical music would do more to save the sinking ship of the big recording labels.  As it is, my money is going to the recording companies outlined above where I can, as you should to.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|To sum up everything I'm about to go over, this is a 5-star movie crippled by 0-star presentation.  This DVD presentation of the Avengers is a textbook example of what's wrong with the DVD industry.<br /><br />The very first menu you have is a language selection menu.  Why?  And what's with the annoying \\"ding\\" sound?  What's that, Iron Man's fist?  Thor's hammer?  It's completely without context, especially with the background image.  I click on English so I can either get to the real menu, or at least the movie.<br /><br />Marvel logo plays, followed by one for Paramount.  Standard stuff before the film starts.  Then you're treated to a commercial for the individual Avenger characters' movies.  Iron Man, Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America and... The Avengers?  The movie that I'm currently waiting to watch?  Huh... And a short mention of Avengers Assemble.<br /><br />The Marvel logo plays again, and now there's an ad for Avengers Alliance - a Facebook game.  Really?  Now there's an advertisement for Marvel Universe, which includes cartoons of Spider-Man and the Avengers playing on a Disney channel.<br /><br />And now a Coming Soon to theaters?  It's a trailer for Frankenweenie.  Seeing as this DVD came out on September 25th and Frankenweenie opens October 5th, this bit is relevant for all of 10 days.<br /><br />Warning that promotions may not available all territories, then some wireframe helicarrier animation.  Oh, hey, finally!  The actual menu.  7 minutes and 11 seconds later.  Fine!  Play!<br /><br />Outro animation, legal warnings, the Marvel logo for a third time, and Paramount's logo.  50+ seconds later, the exposition begins.  Over 8 minutes just to get to the movie.<br /><br />They took a great movie and treated the paying customer like cattle.  I do not advocate piracy in the least, and stupid stuff like this is certainly not the majority reason for film piracy... but you what?  Pulling pathetic acts like those described above sure aren't helping matters.<br /><br />But again, this movie is awesome.  I'm really conflicted on what rating to give it.  Hopefully a version with more bonus content (Director's Cut!) and less mindless advertising will be released.
B006XOBFJC|5.0|I ordered this recording after reading favorable reviews and noticing the startlingly low price.  I make no claims as to being an opera expert, but have listened and tried to learn what I can for the last ten years.  While I respect historical recordings I am not willing to listen to poor sound quality.  This recording has the sound quality of a modern recording, and excellent singers as well.  For quality and price this may be the bargain of a lifetime.  pseverson

B006LSZECO|2.0|I really wanted to love this book, but I didn't.  It was a ho-hum book with a great writing style.  Don't get me wrong at times it was a page turner, but it was maybe for a chapter and then it became almost boring.

0316228532|3.0|I have to start out by saying what a huge fan I am of J.K. Rowling, because I feel that may help some people understand my review better.  I'm a HUGE Potter fan, I re-read the series regularly and have been anticipating the release of any new book by Rowling for the past 5 years.  That being said, I didn't expect this book to be anything like Harry Potter plot-wise, or even in theme.  I was super-excited about something completely new from J.K. Rowling.  Regardless of what anyone says of her prose in her previous series I always found something sparkling and intoxicating in her writing style and characterizations.  So I eagerly purchased the Casual Vacancy on the first day of its release, and launched into it like a child greedily rips open presents on Christmas morning.  If anything asserts the distinction that this is not Harry Potter or any other book for young readers its the immediate and excessive usage of loose profanity, rampant drug and alcohol abuse and sexual depravity.  We are launched into the mind of every single character we encounter at some point, viewpoints shifting back and forth dizzyingly.  This allows us a unique access to their thoughts and backstories, and this third-person omniscent is very contrary to the third-person limited we experienced in her series.  Being a lover of minute details and normative everyday activities and thoughts, I was prepared to love this in every way.  You have to understand how much it pains me to say that I don't think I do, I feel the need to love it, to defend Jo Rowling and all her brilliance, but I think it would be \\"inauthentic\\" of me to claim it.  To me it feels like there's something missing.  This book is so dark and gloomy and heavy, and perhaps its meant to be after years of writing good-natured comedy and happy endings.  However the heaviness is wearing, and I found myself returning relentlessly back to the book, not as I have to all her others in avid anticipation of what would happen next, but with asense of duty.  Though the characters are not wholly uninteresting, there're all seriously flawed in one way or another (which may be more true to life) but which makes it difficult to really find any of them likable and sympathetic, though it gets easier towards the end.  Something I missed here too was Jo Rowling's talent to easily weave seemingly small, but vastly important details into the story and keep them hidden there for later discovery and impact.  She does much less vivid a job creating a physical world for us under the assumption we can just see the small town without fresh and fruitful descriptors, and as a result the town seems flat, the homes nearly indistinguishable.  For me, the spark was missing, and throughout at least 90% of the novel I could scarcely believe it was authored by J.K. Rowling.  And though I'm sure she's intentionally moving away from and editting her writing so it doesn't match Potter, the attempt to redefine seems to rob some of the best qualities of Jo Rowling's writing.  Overall, it's okay, not completely unenjoyable, has some really poignant and heartfelt moments, but definitely isn't for everyone and won't inspire the cult following of her previous series; which may have been Jo's intentions all along.

B005N0C0JQ|5.0|During the past few months, I have been listening nearly constantly to both Beady Eye and Noel's High Flying Birds. Believe it or not, I don't know what I was doing in the 90's but Oasis didn't hit my radar until years later. I have spent a lot of time catching up.<br /><br />I think that it fair to agree with George Martin that Noel Gallagher is the greatest song writer of his generation. Another person said that he was the McCartney of his generation. Of course the beauty of art is in the eye of the beholder, but I couldn't agree more with Sir George Martin.<br /><br />I think that Noel's 1st solo record truly is his greatest effort yet. The depth and complexity of his song writing, vocal and instrument arranging is unbelieveable. Check out the record with headphones on some time. He has a fantastic voice which has matured over time. You can see the growth in his voice from the \\"Don't look back Anger \\" days to now. The former is stil fantastic but his voice has really developed. Remember Noel used to just sing a few songs in Oasis.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the Beady Eye album a great deal. I think that Gem and Andy have written some great songs. \\"Beatles and Stones\\" is a piece of garbage and should not have been on the Beady Eye debut. I think that was a nod to Liam. I do really love the Beady Eye album. I think that Laim, Gem, Andy and Chris are super cool.<br /><br />Noel's album has a maturity and profoundness that Beady Eye doesn't. And that is ok. I too am very sad that Oasis broke up, as Liam truly does have an iconic voice even 20 years later.<br /><br />Quite a few people have made mention that there isn't too much \\"big guitar\\" on NGHFB. I think that is because Noel sees himself more as a songwriter and singer than a guitarist. Of course he is a great guitarist.<br /><br />It seems like Noel has grown up and changed a great deal. If you look at the Oasis hyjinks on You Tube from the 90's and see a NG interview today, you see a man who has matured and grown up.<br /><br />I cannot say enough for this album. Buy it and enjoy.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I had the original Marware cover in black which I liked very much but the dog ate it!  I replaced it with the purple, primarily because it was less expensive at the time but am liking it better than the original.  You do not need to remove your Kindle from the clips to use the stand which is just a little bit more convenient.  I also like the purple color so I always know which Kindle is mine (multiple Kindle household!)

1451696191|4.0|Charlie... prefers to observe.  Well, observe and carry on discussions on paper written to \\"Dear Friend\\" about the people he sees, how funny some people act now that he is in 10th grade, why things are the way they are, the girl he likes, the discrimination he sees, why does he always respond by crying, and his quirky family dynamics.<br /><br />Charlie, alone is just fine as he is quite self motivated and can find plenty to do.  His English teacher seems to pick up on Charlies gift of reading and writing and assigns his additional reports to write on books that he chooses for Charlie which is well... fine, and maybe a little weird as Charlie really doesn't want his only friend to be his English teacher.<br /><br />That's just awkward.<br /><br />And then Charlie meets Sam and Patrick and things get a little easier.  Sam is Patrick's (beautiful!) sister and they too seem to stand a bit to the sidelines, but somehow - they make it look cool to be on the outside of the clicks and the trends.  As their friendship grows Charlie becomes more sure of himself and more comfortable in his own skin.<br /><br />Why oh why does it take me so long to read some books that I know I want to and them when I do.... wow, I have to say what took me so long?  Perks Of Being A Wallflower on audio made me laugh, sigh, and yeah, like Charlie, it made me cry... but in a good way.  Narrated by Noah Galvin I had goosebumpy (my word) feelings of a John Green novel - and that is a BIG compliment.<br /><br />The book is smart and witty.  Charlie's character is the perfect mix of teenage awkwardness, low self-esteem, and the push to be something more because you know inside... you are something more.  I love books that talk about books and when (yes when!) I listen to this one again I will need to write down all the book references because there is something about books that talk about books that makes me want to read the books that were discussed.  To Kill A Mockingbird, Catcher In The Rye, Walden, The Fountainhead, Naked Lunch, Peter Pan...  (and I love that some of them are banned books as this one is too!).<br /><br />The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is about growing up and growing strong.  It is about friendships that don't relay on status or stereotypes.  It is a book I think we all need to read in our lifetime and sit back and bask in what true friendship is.  It is heartbreaking at times and it is heartwarming.  Looking for a great audio?  Pick this one up and thank me later.en, The Fountainhead, Naked Lunch, Peter Pan...

B005USZYDU|2.0|Being a huge fan of John Grisham ,I was disappointed that the book did not deliver enough nerve-fraying and jaw dropping suspense.<br /><br />A murder is committed in the small city of Strattenburg.  Our protagonist, Theodore Boone , a young school kid who aspires to become a lawyer just like his parents one day, stumbles over a piece of information so vital that it could change the whole course of the ongoing trial.<br /><br />There isn't any wicked twist or Machiavellian politics in the story, and it just falls plain in the end. The book is more like a textbook guide to courtroom scenes and trials. But for young adults, this book could offer itself as a starter to the world of legal thrillers.

B000W8HC8I|1.0|This just might be the lamest, most awful book I have read in a few years.  And that includes a Tucker Max book, folks.  In fact, this book is worse, much worse.  The author so shamefully ripping off entire phrases from movies I have enjoyed watching in the past, like A Bronx Tale.  Word for word.  Does he give the movies credit for plagiarising their dialog?<br /><br />Entire paragraphs drone on and on about how many Quaaludes the idiot protagonist has taken.  Or can't remember taking.  Or how many hookers he has paid.<br /><br />Who edited this story and allowed it to get published?<br /><br />I was hoping that the childish antics were going to eventually lead up to a story about a Wall Street broker.  Instead, we are left with a pathetic attempt at, what exactly?  At nothing.  This should not even be considered a novel.  The writing is dreadful.  After about 60 pages, I could read no more.  Avoid this book.  You'd be better off using your time reading - well, just about anything else would be better.<br /><br />If I could have given this book review less than 1 star, I would have.  Good thing it's digital or I would have been forced to burn it.  This piece of crap will forever remain ARCHIVED.  I only wish I could get a credit for my Amazon account.

Very interesting bits of information that I never realized. I highly recommend this book to anyone. It isn't particularly graphic either, maybe Pg-13.<br /><br />This book is very inspiring and if I were a kid, it would make me want to do it all again and go after a goal like he did.

B008I3QZKU|5.0|This album is lighter on the rock and heavier on the synth/pop than Hot Fuss and Sam's Town, but it is still great. The songwriting is more compelling than Day and Age, which had some good singles but lacked a cohesive album feel. Moreover, both Hot Fuss and Sam's Town had one song that I really hated. Battle Born has its weaker songs, but it is still a first-rate album. For those who will only be happy with repeats of the previous albums... what can I say, you are stuck in the past and you're missing out on enjoying some good music. Go into this album with an open mind and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

B007TK77QE|1.0|The Casual Vacancy is a dull and dismal book, about dull and dismal people living in a dull and dismal village. I did read it right though to the bitter end, hoping and hoping for one tiny gleam of brilliance among the dross. I didn't find it and I didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />There is no magic in this book and, no, I'm not talking about Harry Potter style magic. I'm talking about the simple magic that every good book has, that takes you out of your world into the world that the book is set in. This book just doesn't do that. The scene is never really set, the characters are wooden and unreal. There is very little real emotion in the story. I felt like I was reading a third hand account, perhaps written by a social worker, of many of the events. The characters just did not connect with me, they seemed like caricatures rather than real people.<br /><br />I am at a complete loss trying to understand what the author was hoping to achieve with this story. I'm not even sure I could call it a story, it's more a rambling, incoherent account of a few sad and miserable characters that ends with a pathetic whimper.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that J.K. Rowling is no longer one of my \\"must buy\\" authors.
1451662432|5.0|This is a fabulous story about a fabulous personality. Is it self-serving? Of course it is. Is it an honest portrayal about an American icon? How could it be, and do we as readers have a right to expect complete honesty in a book like this? The answer is probably not, the author is after all in the image making business. Since most of us have never met and will probably never meet the terminator, we only know of him through the media, and that in all instances is managed. Now we are given a 690 page narrative with pictures spread over 30 delicious chapters, and this reader feels it has been beautifully written, even if it isn't the whole deal.<br /><br />First what are we dealing with here? This is an autobiography, so don't look for the reality of what this man's life and actions have truly been. You won't find it, nor do we probably have a right to find it, although there is still the expectation of candor. After all, an autobiography is an edited selection of the events of an individual's entire life. The author gets to portray himself however he wants to, putting in what he wants, how he wants, and leaving out what he doesn't want.<br /><br />In this highly readable and fast going narrative, Arnold tells his story from his humble origins in Austria, to the dreams he gave himself growing up, and then the journey to America where he creates and fulfills a fantasy life that the rest of us can only maintain as a dream state. He talks about using steroids as a bodybuilder. He claims a lack of knowledge about them. Others in bodybuilding at the time knew the real deal, and knowledge was there if he had wanted it.<br /><br />He is one of only three major bodybuilders to strike it rich through this profession. The other two are Steve Reeves, an extremely handsome man who went onto fame as Hercules in Hollywood. There was also Reg Park, another fabulous athlete who adorned Arnold's bedroom walls while he was growing up. Schwarzenegger mentions both of them on page 30 of the book but certainly does not give enough credit to them as the role models and the revolutionaries they were, that allowed him to stand on their shoulders and take bodybuilding so much higher than it had ever been before.<br /><br />After winning Mr. Universe which is thoroughly covered in Chapter 4, the author talks about calling up Reg Park in South Africa and reminding him that Park had invited him to South Africa if and when Schwarzenegger won the Mr. Universe contest. Park was as good as his word, sending the young bodybuilder a ticket. Arnold spent several weeks with Park and his family and it was probably here that he realized his dreams as a child could be turned into realities. He saw a family life he never had, and success that he thought could be but had never seen a model for it before. He now had the model which was crucial to his attempt to make a reality out of the dream.<br /><br />He put a plan into his own mind at that point. It included America, bigger things in bodybuilding, Hollywood, a family, wealth, and eventually politics. The rest of the book, some 550 pages more is the story of each aspect of his plan meticulously played out before our eyes. It all began with the model. It is always the revolutionary that matters, the first to do something is always excruciatingly difficult and for most seems impossible which is why it remains unfulfilled for so many years.<br /><br />It took 2000 years for the first runner to run the four minute mile, than within 15 month, 12 others did it. Arnold had the model in Reg Park and Steve Reeves, but it was to his credit that he took the reality to such a much higher plane than anybody had ever thought possible.<br /><br />Throughout the book you will laugh, you will reflect, and you will marvel that the American dream is still alive and worthwhile. Some people will be of the opinion that all it takes is a dream and access to America and yes it can all come through, if you simply work hard. In the book thatappears to be the conclusion that Arnold draws for his own life (more about this later). The following chapters are glittering, enticing and very entertaining aspects of this philosophy.<br /><br />* Chapter 10 - Stay Hungry<br /><br />* Chapter 14 - What Doesn't Kill Us Makes Us Stronger<br /><br />* Chapter 18 - Comic Timing<br /><br />* Chapter 26 - The Comeback<br /><br />* Chapter 30 - Arnold's Rules<br /><br />You the reader must come to your own conclusions as to how much of the book is disingenuous and self-serving and perhaps an attempt to rehabilitate an image that was very much tarnished by the affair(s) that he had, and the birth of a child outside his marriage. The author goes through a lot of effort to make the story come out his way. As readers we shouldn't fault him for this effort, but simply keep it in mind as we search for entertainment and understanding as to what it took for him to succeed. We also get the sheer fantasy fulfillment of our own notions about what it would be like to lead the fantastic, unbelievable existence that is portrayed throughout this book.<br /><br />It is probably true that the author has not led one life but many lives, and he has basically fulfilled most of his wishes in a life that is not yet complete. At one time or another he has journeyed to the top of the following worlds:<br /><br />1) Bodybuilding<br /><br />2) Hollywood<br /><br />3) Politics<br /><br />4) Business<br /><br />5) Wealth<br /><br />6) Celebrity<br /><br />Only the author knows whether in the end it was all worth, was it a life worth living, and what does he do now with the time that is left? He must also balance it off with the affair that is explored in chapter 29 entitled \\"The Secret\\". You can't have all the above without also having to deal with this self-made star voluntarily destroying his family and his wife who is prominent in her own right, Maria Shriver.<br /><br />We the readers are not aware of what occupies the author's mind during the moments when he is truly alone. Is it sadness, compassion, is there reflection, or does he simply remain on the ladder of success struggling for the next step on that ladder which is signified by \\"Arnold's Rules\\" explored in Chapter 30. This last chapter is worth the price of the book alone for in it, he tells you what he believes are the driving daily habits behind his success.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />This is one reader who loved this book. It was a fabulous read, comical and entertaining too. One felt that you really got to know the author well, that you may have been in touch with his core at different points. It is also ture that the book was very clearly written on his terms. You can take him for what he says, you can disagree, but you cannot deny that this immigrant from Austria has lived and continues to live a bigger than life story, and is the personification, warts and all of the American dream of success.  To this reader it is clearly NOT true that all you need is a vision of success, a willingness to work hard, and the ability to executive the vision and then you too can become a success like the author.<br /><br />Many people, no matter how hard they work, for many reasons never make it, and it is not their fault that they fail. What is important at the end of one's life is that when you look back at YOUR life, you are able to say that I did the things I wanted to do, and I have NO REGRETS. Hopefully the author can say this about his life, although for the rest of us, it and he remain what appears to be an incredible life played out on many of the public stages of the world.

The phrasing and language is very different from what you'll read in modern thrillers, but underneath the dark prose is a down to earth horrifying story that you won't forget.

1451696205|5.0|I enjoyed The Perks of Being a Wallflower so much, that in addition to buying a hardcover version of the book, I also purchased the eBook version and saw the movie. It's a sad, sweet and heartfelt tale of a teen boy's life and the effects of events from his past. The format of the story presented in letters is very interesting and is a timeline guide. I won't reveal more details because I'm not a story spoiler. There are many inspiring quotes like ... 'In that moment, I swear we were infinite.\\", \\"We accept the love we think we deserve.\\", and \\"...But even if we don't have the power to chose where we come from, we can still chose where we go from there.\\"

There...there it is, now descend down the staircase and walk out into 1958. No need to worry about time travel, keeping us free to focus on what Stevie does best. Telling the story.<br /><br />An excellent read that should once and for all shatter the myths that A) King is a horror writer and B) he's not a great writer. He shows that he is with the breadth of story ideas that he brings to life.<br />[[ASIN:B009EAV6VY Poisoned Soil]]
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This action packed thriller is a must-read but be prepared to suspend reality and just go with the flow of the storyline.   It is bizarre and imaginative, and in the end you have to wonder what YOU would do under the same circumstances.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down!    a definite page turner that keeps you guessing what's going to happen next.  a good love story as well.
0345803485|1.0|The beginning was romantic. I liked the character development. Suspense built as the plot thickened.  If the man was not rich and powerful would he have just been a creep? I don't think this is romance. It is just porn.
0451169514|5.0|Gotta love \\"The King\\"...he has numerous styles. I realize many view him as solely a writer of horror, but that's not true. All of King's books involve a great sense of story and feature well-developed characters, but if it's old fashioned horror you want, this book (and Pet Sematary) is as good as it gets. Suspend your disbelief for just a moment and picture the clown lurking below street level, romping through the sewers and luring you in to show you the terror behind his face paint. Pure story, pure horror...like I said, as good as it gets.<br /><br />Read with the lights on!<br />[[ASIN:B009EAV6VY Poisoned Soil]]

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was well written and a fun read. I loved that it was written in two voices. Kept my interest. The ending was scary
B006LSZECO|4.0|With over 2,000 reviews it's hard to add much new. Some love it, some hate it, but for me, Gillian's writing is worth reading for the prose alone. It sucks you in and keeps you there until the end, at which time you can decide if you liked the story or not. Regardless, she's a fantastic author and Gone Girl is worth a read. [[ASIN:B009EAV6VY Poisoned Soil]]
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It kept me in complete suspense of how she was going to react, thinking if you leave this guy, you're crazy....he's flawed but changing...for the good....so good!
B0017VG69U|5.0|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017VG69U/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title<br /><br />I used these DVDs in my classroom to show the number of science fiction items that we have in common use today. Bluetooth, communicators are cell phones, automatic doors, epipens, computers that talk, etc. Students enjoyed finding these and thinking about what is science fiction now will be reality in the future. Also, the science fiction then that scientists are still working to achieve.
160774273X|5.0|I am a huge fan of Ken's artisan pizza and since his take-out is so limited, as well as the seating, I needed this book for my weekly cravings.  I was a little intimidated at first, since I have never baked bread before in my life (any kind), but Ken made it so easy with his step-by-step instructions and the pictures that really helped illustrate his words.  My first loaf came out gorgeous!  I couldn't believe how easy and fun it was as well.  I really enjoyed the conversational and unintimidating way that Ken described the steps.  What was the most engaging in the book though was Ken's passion for baking, it showed through in his little blurbs such as \\"It is really cool.\\"  I had to smile everytime I read one of these little nuggets of enthusiasm, and I am so glad the book was not over-edited such that they were taken out.  Next time I go to the restaurant I will have to take my book in and see if I can get him to sign it.
B007L6VR6M|4.0|Wes Anderson does his thing again with a quirky, rich, melancholy character piece. The particulars may be different, but really he's been making the same movie (in many cases, even using the same actors) for years and this one's no different: it's artfully arranged, leisurely paced and quietly withdrawn. It rewards those with the notion to read in between the lines, embraces the beauty of a natural setting, and cracks awkwardly funny stone-faced jokes at the most unexpected moments. The mood is decidedly childish, both in subject and in perspective, but for the most part that works to put the audience in the right mindset, rather than dumbing things down. It does occasionally overstretch itself, though, particularly as events begin to climax and believability abruptly becomes less of a priority. If you've enjoyed Anderson's earlier pictures there's plenty to like here, although it doesn't even begin to rival Rushmore or The Royal Tenenbaums and I was surprised by the lack of a matching soundtrack. Non-fans should continue to keep their distance.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THIS THIRD BOOK, DO NOT WANT IT TO END.  I AM HOPING FOR WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A HAPPY ENDING!

REALLY REALLY like white stripes and well this is quite a bit different. for now its so-so but im sure the more i listen the better it will get. side a is great. b is mostly just instrumental.

B005R32L66|1.0|I have a 7\\" EMATIC e-Glide Steal that comes with a forward facing camera.  This is what I tried to download and use SKYPE on. For some reason SKYPE works great on my laptop and it worked great on my old desktop, but the tablet is another story. It seems to see the tablet as a telephone and refuses to access the camera. I tried to use my current account, which it could not recognize on the tablet; I tried to set up a new account, which it refused to see as anything except a telephone, so I gave up and deleted it. Maybe it is the hardware that poses a problem, I don't know, but in my opinion SKYPE is not the same on a tablet as it is on your PC. Be warned to avoid the frustration I went through.

B007U1FEJE|1.0|I have loved the Beach Boys since as far back as I can remember ('62? '63?) and really wanted this to be incredible, but I just have no idea how people can write these glowing reviews; this is just terrible. It is almost as if Brian provided throwaway songs for this and saves the good stuff for his solo efforts. For something truly great, pick up Brian's 'Lucky Old Sun' instead; no fluff, no drivel and most importantly, no Mike Love.

B008FIHUDO|4.0|Bettye is back with another album of classy soulful covers, this time produced by Craig Street, probably best known for his work on Norah Jones gazillion-selling \\"Come Away with Me\\" but he's also worked with Cassandra Wilson, k.d. lang, John Legend and Chris Whitley. This album carries on in the same style as her previous albums \\"I've Got My Own Hell to Raise\\" and \\"Interpretations: The British Rock Songbook\\" - stripped-down, sparse arrangements of various interesting songs that highlight Bettye's excellent world-weary, tortured voice.<br /><br />As with the previous albums I think that this formula can wear a bit thin and that some covers work (Sly Stone's title track) while others don't (Beth Nielsen Chapman's \\"Fair Enough\\") and I still can't decide if Betty's re-write of Ewan MacColl's \\"Dirty old town\\" (transferred from Salford UK to Detroit USA) works or not. I thought that Dylan's \\"Everything Is Broken\\" was a bit predictable and that the Black Keys' \\"I'm Not the One\\" was a bit pedestrian but Gnarls Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" is transformed into a downhome blues (?!?) and the Savoy Brown Blues Band's \\"I'm Tired\\" is rescued from obsurity for a funky workout. There are also nice covers of songs by Neil Young and Tom Waits but ultimately this album is about that wonderful voice.
B007TK77QE|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book, but once I did, it grew on me, and I read with increasing interest to the end. The characters are interesting, and the author successfully developed the story of their interaction in a small English town, where lives and plots are woven together.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|I trully love my new processor.  However, it was not indicated that the connector plug was only 3 prongs, my computer needed a 4 prong connector.  Still, it was installed, and it worked. I hadn't saved any of my games, so I lost years of play and installed items.  Not being very tech savy, I would have appreciated, a reminder that I should save any material of value.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|Hemmingway's writings are vivid and picturesque.  He makes Jake Barnes, the lead character, seem like he's right next to you.  Indeed, more like your partacking in the adventure.  I'm not much for bull fights but that did not deter from the enjoyment of reading about the running of the bulls in Pamplona or the bull fights themselves.  He makes the restaurants and bars seem like a life in themselves.  Hemmingway is a great writer.  I'm on my way to reading his next book.  Tommy
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the action and adventure of the story. I was able to read it immediately on my Kindle and was pulled right into the story. It stands alone great! Or you can read on to find out how the adventure continues. I didn't understand why everyone was talking about this story but when the movie came out I decided to read it. I see the draw and \\"pull\\" of the story. There is a little something for everyone. Thanks!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Nothing better than cause and effect anticipation for the kids on a simple app. Its funtime for everyone. I like the ease and fun.

B00846REIS|5.0|Great book can't wait for the next one! I hop e the third book is ready by the time I read the next one..
B003O86FMW|4.0|The author almost exclusively uses first-person, stream of consciousness, present tense mode. She does a good job of creating a sense of urgency, however it becomes tiresome and somewhat anti-climatic as the same urgency is carried throughout the entire series. The story is compelling though and somehow manages to get you emotionally involved even though the supporting cast of  characters seem somewhat underdeveloped and the main character, explained partially due to her purported age, shallow.<br /><br />Obviously aimed at younger readers, the vocabulary is simple and easy to read even at a quick pace. The subject matter however may be more difficult for the target audience to grasp, and even harder for them to develop the intended emotional response given the violence saturated state of contemporary entertainment.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Interesting plot but  could have been more original. The acting was OK but nothing special. It almost seemed like the characters were cardboard cutouts played by actors who weren't really \\"into\\" them. All in all I liked it for its entertainment value and special effects and while I'm glad I didn't spend $25 for movie tickets, I didn't mind spending $4 for an Amazon rental.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of the things that in cinematography is more difficult to achieve is to keep the audience connected with the movie for two hours and something which is the typical duration of a film. This is actually even more difficult in action movies where fast paced scene usually don't last too long or have the risk of getting the audience tired , exhausted of never ending violence or getting used to endless shooting scenes for example and then people lost interest.<br />This movie I guarantee you will keep you glue on your seat.  This is the perfect movie to watch at home in blue ray or 3D and use that extra volume in your surround sound system.<br />No wonder why this movie was such a success blockbuster and was #1 in sales for such a long time. There is also a couple of good lines and dry humor for adults. The bonus scenes are fantastic. Everybody in the cast do his job almost to perfection. There is a line with Hulk and the bad guy that my 5 year old finds so amusing he keeps playing it over and over again and cracking up. That scene and the line \\"Puny God\\" will pass like one of those never forgotten parallel with that Indiana Jones scene  and the guy with super high skills with the sword that Indiana Jones just shot and goes away.<br />Very entertaining, super high quality special effects, funny lines, an incredible collection of talent. This is a Block buster film that you should not miss.  It has all the ingredients of a good film a band or misfits that needs something to glue them together, a boss of the gang that does not cope well with the guys in the \\"desks\\", all those coming together to produce of course a happy ending. It does not hurt at all that Scarlett Johansson is incredibly beautiful.<br />A must have movie.

044024367X|5.0|There is nothing between Hope and Dispair except for Jack Reacher and if you poke the animal in him he will bite. Actually he will break your arm off and club you to your demise with it so leave him alone. Fortunately for the readers of the Jack Reacher series the bad guys do not follow that advice and immediately stick their arm all the way into the Reacher hornet's nest and get the full fury of our favorite drifter do-gooder.....Number 12 in the series that proves Lee Child has plenty of ideas for more Jack Reacher installments....
B008CP92ZO|1.0|Glad I didn't pay a whole lot to watch this movie, it was funny in parts but didn't really enjoy it overall
B000002KNY|5.0|The album was well received by reviewers. Jon Pareles, writing in Rolling Stone, was impressed with its &#34;unswerving rhythms&#34; and Byrne's lyrical evocations; he concluded, &#34;Fear of Music is often deliberately, brilliantly disorienting. Like its black, corrugated packaging (which resembles a manhole cover), the album is foreboding, inescapably urban and obsessed with texture.&#34;[20] John Rockwell of The New York Times suggested that the record was not a conventional rock release,[19] while Stephanie Pleet of The Daily Collegian commented that it showed a positive progression in Talking Heads' musical style.[16] Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, praised the album's &#34;gritty weirdness&#34;, but noted that &#34;a little sweetening might help&#34;.[24] Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times was impressed with Byrne's &#34;awesome vocal performance&#34; and its nuances and called Fear of Music &#34;a quantum leap&#34; for the band.[17] Tom Bentkowski of New York concluded, &#34;But what makes the record so successful, perhaps, is a genuinely felt anti-elitism. Talking Heads was clever enough to make the intellectual infectious and even danceable.&#34;[18]<br /><br />Allmusic's William Ruhlmann claimed that Fear of Music is &#34;an uneven, transitional album&#34;, but gave it a rating of four-and-a-half stars out of five by pointing out that it includes songs that match the quality of the band's best works.[15] In the 1995 Spin Alternative Record Guide, Eric Weisbard gave the record a rating of nine out of ten and called it Talking Heads' most musically varied offering.[22] In a 2003 review, Chris Smith of Stylus praised Byrne's personas and Eno's stylised production techniques.[23] In The Rough Guide to Rock published the same year, Andy Smith concluded that the album is a strong candidate for the best LP of the 1970s because it is &#34;bristling with hooks, riffs and killer lines&#34;.[21]<br /><br />(wikipedia)
B005LAIGKU|3.0|Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an underachiever bike messenger in NYC. He has issues with his girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) who in turn is being evicted by her roommate Nima(Jamie Chung) and she is being hit on by Wilee's work mate Manny (Wol&eacute; Parks).<br /><br />Wilee likes to ride and is reckless. Once we get some quick character introductions, Wilee has to pick up a message from Nima...a premium rush, and deliver it in China Town. There is a policeman (Michael Shannon) with a gambling debt that is attempting to intercept the message.<br /><br />The plot is straight forward with no twists. Most of the film is bike riding. The film starts out as a flashback and then gives us flashbacks within the flashback to explain plot points. I was rather bored  with the whole film, but this might have a younger audience appeal.<br /><br />Parental guide: 1 F-bomb (why do they do that?), no sex or nudity.
0515142247|5.0|After reading the first Jack Reacher book by author Lee Childs I was hungry for the next installment. He did not disappoint in \\"Die Trying\\" nor did he stay with the same storyline....oh no, not in this book. New scenes, new situations and much more action and excitement are in store for the readers in this book. Sometimes you feel the author being a little careless with the character making him vulnerable....maybe a bit too vulnerable and we might lose the guy....But Reacher is a survivor and he can if necessary outwit the author if he must to survive....
B0098VYCCE|4.0|End was dry but movie had some great features. Acting was well done to create characters, visuals were great I recommend HD or Blu-Ray. Totally left room for sequel....wonder what will come next???
B006LSZECO|3.0|Really enjoyed book all the way through until the very end!  Without ruining it for anyone it was very anticlimactic.  I read this with my book club and we are 90% in agreement with our disappointment in the ending...
B008N5UX9M|5.0|No, it doesn't sound like Iron Maiden.<br />It's not Iron Maiden.<br />British Lion is however a great rock record. Proggy, classic with a modern sound.<br />Don't believe whats being said about vocalist Richard Taylor either,  he does a great job and his voice fits these songs nicely. From the fantastic opener \\"This is my God\\" to the anthemic \\"The Chosen Ones\\" to the mellow closing \\"The Lesson\\".<br />If you're a fan of 70's hard rock, give this a chance. Don't compare it to \\"Number Of The Beast, Bruce Dickinson, or anything Maiden and I think you'll enjoy.

B0084I9QFU|1.0|This record is crap. It was a major let down sales wise after Thriller and only sold as many copies as it did because it was a follow up to one of the biggest albums in Pop music history. Jackson peaked with Thriller and everything after it was a pale comparison. Plus you could not give Micheal Jackson CD's away before he died. There was a reason he was so broke! I am not going to go into his personal life. You don't need to. Based on music alone this record is what it advertised! That this record is Bad. Not bad cool. Just plain old bad!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Album's writing often calls me to look at life from a new perspective.  The Timekeeper is not an exception.  The way he intertwines the 3 stories that are told has you expecting that there will ultimately be a connection, but the way in which it happens, for me at least, was not expected.  Of course, the subject of time holds its own mysteries.  Thoroughly enjoyed the book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I ended up buying all 3 books because I couldn't wait to see how it ended.  Wasn't disappointed.<br />Loved all 3.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|While the story telling is what I expected from Lee Child, this particular novel left me feeling like it was unfinished. The writing was still good, but I felt like it could have been more detailed and the ending could have been a bit crisper.

Bought it for a friend, going to purchase my own copy. Vinyl is still the BEST! Glad it's making a serious return. Of course you need the proper quality equipment to enjoy it to it's fullest. Bought an analog c.d. changer, what a difference! Most people these days probably couldn't tell the difference, but I could, LOVE MUSIC! Dave Schmidt, G'ville FL.

0143034901|5.0|Have you ever read what you consider to be the best book ever that you find yourself telling everyone you know (and some you don't know) about how good it is and how they MUST read it?<br /><br />That is exactly how I felt when I was about halfway through Shadow of the Wind, savouring every word from that moment on. I could not for the life of me, put it down. I loved it so much, I practically cried when it was done. Not because the book was sad, but because I was sad the book was over. I wish I had never read it. If I had never read it, I would be able to read it now, and that would make me so infinitesimally happy.<br /><br />I was living in Barcelona at the time and I was just finishing up my last semester of my Master's program. I remember it was in february that I had just about had enough with school work and wanted to take a break from all the canonical mumbo jumbo I had to read. I went on my afternoon stroll and ended up at the FNAC (a department store in the city center). Although I was in the midst of a reading marathon, I obviously found myself in the book department.<br /><br />There was what seemed to be a shrine dedicated to Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n in the middle of the floor obstructing my path to the G authors. Normally I don't care much for the ultra popular books, but for some reason, that day, I stopped to see what all the fuss was about. I was reading through the first few pages when a elderly man passed me by and said, \\"Este libro te va a cambiar la vida.\\" (\\"This book will change your life.\\") It was magical and spooky all at the same time. I felt like I had to read this novel. Mystery, thriller, history... these are not genres that I typically read, and these were the categories that described Shadow of the Wind.<br /><br />I got home and prepared dinner. I ate and finished up some research. I made my way into bed and grabbed the book that was about to change my life. Well, Shadow of the Wind did not, in any way, change my life, but it did leave me in a holding my breath, hugging the pages, begging for more. Really, it did.<br /><br />Who knew that a novel set in Barcelona about the mystery behind a book would catch my attention? Wait, that's exactly what would grip me.<br /><br />I don't really want to say anything about this book other than: it is one of the most amazing books I have ever read in my whole life! I am not worried that I am overselling it or that since I made such big claims, you'll be greatly disappointed. I am not worried at all. The story is outstanding and it is definitely worth reading... and worthy of my recommendation.<br /><br />It's tops.<br /><br />check out more reviews at: [...]e pages, begging for more.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|The best yet when it comes to an imaginative, illustrative view of a world overrun with the undead.  Plenty of insight into both sides of human nature, although the stories in it are sometimes abrupt, for myself it added to the feel of a post war compilation, like each story could have been its own book.  I got into it, liked the book quite a bit, just in time for the new season of \\"the walking dead\\" :D

B007ZH9P0C|5.0|Well, it's hard to call the last Madonna's music efforts - hits...Although many don't like \\"Girl gone wild\\" and call it \\"repetitive\\" I think it's one of few songs on the album that could have become hits...If only they were served with a reasonable promo campaign.<br />This maxi single is another example of how poor Madonna music is released nowadays:( I tried to buy this cd in: Germany, Belgium, Holland, Poland, France...Any of the big retailers had it in its offer. No wonder the song didn't even got to top 50 in many countries...<br />There are 8 tracks (no album or radio version). As far as I am concerned 6 of them are really great:<br />- dave aude<br />- justin cognito (this remix is also avail. on basic 2-track single)<br />- lucky date<br />- offer nissim<br />- dada life<br />and rebirth remix.<br />Despite the price, it's worth to obtain this cd.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This story gives a lot of food for thought.  It is so well written and gives valuable insights into the problems faced by many people today as they deal with terminal illness  It also gives their caregivers and family great information on what their loved one would like from them.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had never read a book by Stephen King before and could tell the difference between a author who's been writing for years versus the new to the scene authors! this book has me hooked from the beginning  I couldn't wait to read every night! it really makes you think what would you do if you were like the main character. the only negative part about the book with the ending  seems like someone else wrote it and it was very rushed.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game has mystery, great graphics,  and is difficult to put down. it is perfect for my rainy weekend because its easy to not want to give up. many different kinds of puzzles,  hidden objects,  and things to solve.
B003O86FMW|1.0|In the second book, the author can't prevent repeating himself. The feelings of the hero, the scenario is totally same and dull. You know what will happen, i have just skipped some of the parts of the book just to finish it early. I even don't want to buy the third book although i have read the first two book.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|There are so many things about Prometheus that I think are amazing, but there are just as many things that completely destroys it as well.<br /><br />First off finding a planet by using cave paintings as your map makes no sense what so ever. Everything in space moves and changes so how could cave maps that are thousands of years old still work?<br /><br />Secondly the crew of the ship is utterly wrong. Instead of having intelligent people working together, we have what feels like monkeys playing around and banging on things. It just makes no sense and this quite frankly destroyed a big chunk of the movie. I keep thinking about the moon landing back in 60's and I wonder if the crew acted anything like the crew in the movie. I'm guessing more than likely they were proper scientist embarking on a mission, not a bunch of bumbling idiots that do not belong anywhere near a ship, space or an alien planet. We have the 2 laid back scientists, a Scottish soccer beer drinking buffoon, the evil cold bitch running the ship, a robot who looks like the lead character in Lawrence of Arabia, a couple of guys driving the ship that look like the type of guys that would hi five and say bro all the time, some other guys that are just here to die like in Startrek and plenty more colourful characters. These people are just not realistic especially 80 something years in the future and you can easily tell that these personalities are here to play all too familiar roles. Is it impossible to make a movie based around actual proper scientists and how they would act and react in these sort of situations?<br /><br />My 3rd problem with this movie is how the crew go about their business. Let's swap out the scientists for some soldiers, would you A. plan out your mission, find out any and all information you can about the structure you're about to explore and take the necessary precautions to ensure your crew were safe or B. land on a planet, run straight over to the structure and start firing atthe first thing you see? Sadly B is the answer this crew picked. Who in hell would land on a planet, go straight to the structure without running a FULL diagnostic, run willy nilly into it without waiting and then just fool around touching things, taking off helmets and playing with doors without knowing what might happen. For god sakes they didn't even run a full life scan first! Who knows what these creatures are capable of, but who cares let's just go explore and see what happens. Here's a little run down of how things go. The crew finds a dead alien, while they look at the alien, David decides to open the door and Shaw's says \\"we don't know what is behind that door\\". They didn't know anything about anything anyways so why is she worried about what's behind the door? Okay yes they did scan the corridors that they were in but there could have been booby traps, diseases and an untold amount of dangerous things that they didn't know about so why is she so worried what's behind the door, it's not like they cared about anything else. My favorite funny moment is when the 2 guys run off because they are scared, but when they encounter life they decide to investigate. Didn't they try to leave because they were scared?, now they're going to play with some snake thingy's. This is just the tip of the iceberg and I could go on forever about what was done wrong.<br /><br />My last problem with this movie is the fact that this was supposed to be a stand alone movie from the Alien franchise, when in fact it is completely a prequel hiding behind mythology. Just because they focused so much of the movie on how humans evolved and their creators doesn't mean it doesn't have everything to do with the other Alien movies.<br /><br />Overall there is some amazing ideas, acting and visual effects in this movie and for some people that may be enough. I myself enjoyed the mythology and the idea that we came from gods, but the story is hindered by all the problems.
030758836X|3.0|I liked this book...the characters are very messed up  in the head which keeps the reader interested. I had no idea where the book was going to go. however the ending was not  my favorite.
B0099G3I96|5.0|This album is great and I really enjoy listening to it. I love the way Gwen words how she feels in her lyrics and adore the beats of almost all of the songs. I don't really love gravity all that much but the rest of the cd is amazing, so it's worth a 5 star rating.
B005BO2L9I|4.0|2 anni fa sono andato a sentire il \\"Fesival au desert\\" a Timbouctou, ed ho visitato il Mali. In quell'occasione ho capito che quello che avevo letto, cioè che i musicisti del Mali sono fra i migliori dell'Afrca, era vero, ed ho comprato anche parecchi CD. Adesso purtroppo quel paese è stato vittima di colpo di stato e nel nord del paese è sicuramente impossibile andarci senza rischiare molto.<br />Comunque quando ho letto di questa nuova cantante, ho deciso di sentirla. ed ho comprato il Cd, che non mi ha deluso. Ogni musicista Maliano ha sue caratteristiche peculiari che lo distinguono dagli altri, e lei non fa eccezione.
0345803493|5.0|Was glad that I ordered the books together not only so I didn't have to wait to continue reading but the books were in great shape for being used ... almost like new if you hadn't told me they were used I would not have known.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Nicely written. I found myself bookmarking  many areas as they were thought provoking. The end is a bit warm and fuzzy for my liking, but again the thought provoking ideas about our concept of time made it worthwhile reading.  I also liked the short chapters format.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I love how heavy this album is and as always love the amazing lyrics. My favorite songs are Burn It Down, Castle Of Glass and Until It Breaks. Amazing band, album and price.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Many of the reviews on Amazon do an excellent job of summarizing the plot, so I will not repeat that here.  Instead, let me summarize my reaction to this book and perhaps it will help others make up their own mind whether to read it or not.<br /><br />I bought this book because I am a fan of Harry Potter and think J.K. Rowling is an excellent writer.  I wanted to see what an adult book of her's would be like and I was not disappointed.  However, you need to put all thoughts of HP out of your head and it helps to forget Rowling is the author to avoid unfavorable comparisons.<br /><br />It would have been easy to stop reading after about 50 pages, as it is not the type of book I normally enjoy.  The little town of Pagford is filled with petty, gossipy, selfish characters who, initially, really got on my nerves, but after a while I got sucked into their stories.  No one is completely evil and no one will be nominated for sainthood either, but the dynamics between the affluent village of Pagford and their neighbors, the struggling town of Yarvil, made me care, and by the end of the novel I cared a lot.  I haven't read other reviews mentioning it, so perhaps it's only me, but that last paragraph really squeezed my heart.<br /><br />\\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is well written and the social commentary will make you think.  It is not always an easy read.  Lighthearted, wry observation is equally offset by tragedy and loss.  Her teenage characters are particularly well written, while a few of the adults, such as Howard and Shirley, seem a bit over the top.  However, all the characters are written in a certain way to emphasize one point or another, so this is not a criticism.  The balance of the book, for me, was just right, and it's one of those stories I won't soon forget.<br /><br />Harry Potter?  No, far from it.  An excellent novel?  Yes.  For a book that I probably would not have read based on plot description alone, I was surprised by how deeply it affected my emotions.  It's not a book for everybody, and it's a different side of Rowling altogether, but I am extremely glad I gave it a chance.  In my opinion, definitely a worthwhile read.  Hope this helps.
0345803485|5.0|This was perfect.. it came before it was suppose to be at my home and it was in great shape
B007KZY1YY|5.0|wow! wow! wow! i have never read novels like these - these were truly attention keeping novels - filled with love scenes - i particularly appreciated the way the writer displayed that the main characters had flaws and did not paint a picture perfect personality for them - when i finished reading the first book i was eager to read the second then the third - i felt as if the story line was reality that i was a part of - once u start reading them you don't want to stop!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fabulous game, great graphics and well worth the money! I purchased it for my daughter for a rainy weekend and it really creeped her out. This should definately have a rating of pg. It was to scary for her. I took over the game and loved it. I wish that it had a rating system or some warning of violent nature.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I so enjoyed this book.  It contained a number of elements that I just love.  It was science fiction but with a touch of drama and a dash of horror!  The story is a mystery at the beginning and then, slowly, it turns to a science fiction story and then, not so slowly, it turns to a horror story.  Then, in the end, the science fiction wins out!  It's not great literature but it was a breathless page-turner I couldn't put down!  I recommend it for readers who don't want to be able to anticipate what's on the next page!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was spellbound from the beginning.  Mr. Owen was careful not to reveal classified information but gave us the sense of being there at the end of Bin Laden as well as insight into the Seal community.  I can't tell you how proud I am of them and all our military.  You guys ROCK!!
0525953728|4.0|The book was interesting, both from a technological and human viewpoint. The tools of warfare have certainly become quite sophisticated, and I am sure they serve to help preserve the lives of the brave men and women who take on the job of protecting America. The dedication and devotion to duty of the men in this area of the military is admirable, but that it is, by necessity, so all-absorbing seems unfair to the young men involved, and to those who love them. And, make no mistake, this is a young man's game. These guys are in the prime of their youth as they train and train, hardening their bodies and their hearts to the job at hand. This is how it has always been with war. It is a destroyer in so many ways that one wishes the human race would move beyond it.<br /><br />However, that is wishful thinking. War is a fact of life, and we who live in peace only do so because others make the choice to take on the burden of protecting us from those who would do us harm. This book is the story of one such group of men and the mission that put an end to one serious threat to our nation. The debate is, of course, over whether this story should be told or not. Does it compromise the safety of the men and women on the front lines around the world?  I do not know. They are certainly in no worse danger because of me, but are they in increased jeopardy because this book was published.?  Only time will tell the truth of that, but I do think it is worthwhile for Americans to realize the extent of the sacrifice these young men make for our well-being and the preservation of our way of life.<br /><br />It isn't the best piece of writing I even encountered. It was clearly created in a rush in order to get it out there as quickly as possible, and I honestly hope the proceeds will benefit the wounded warriors of our nation. The most impressive, and certainly chilling, aspect of this book is the honor roll in the back of the book of those brave soldiers who have been killed in the war onterror since Osama Bin Laden started that war against Americans. I am humbled by their sacrifice.
B00932A2MC|1.0|A poor man's version of a Michael Bay movie (except it's even worse than that).  Ineptly directed and yet inexplicably arrogant about its own virtues.  A real head scratcher.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This is a book that I really tried to start without any preconceived notions. I banned myself from reading any reviews of this book or any comments about it from other readers (the only thing I allowed myself to read was the book's summary). Basically what I tried to do was forget that J.K. Rowling was the author and to completely separate this book from the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />This book follows the lives of the citizens of a little town called Pagford. It shows how the people of Pagford move on after the death of Barry Fairbrother, a councillor of the parish council. The parish council had been teeming with drama over a lower-income area of Pagford called The Fields and the local drug rehab center, Bellchapel, and it only gets worse after Barry's death.<br /><br />When I first started reading this book I got a bit confused with who all the characters were. There are quite a few characters and the book changes point of view a lot so it does take some time to familiarize yourself with all the characters and how they relate with one another. J.K. Rowling was great with developing and fleshing out the characters throughout the book.<br /><br />The main theme that I really got out of this book was the struggle between the rich and the poor. The selfish and ignorant \\"rich\\" people of Pagford no longer want The Fields to be included in their town. Meanwhile the \\"poor\\" and hopeless people of The Fields are just looking to survive. What J.K. Rowling achieves brilliantly is her unveiling of the two groups to show just how similar they are. Both the rich of Pagford and the poor of The Fields have their own problems and their own battle scars. Neither is better or more perfect than the other.<br /><br />Unlike J.K. Rowling's previous books (which I swore to myself I wasn't going to mention) this book doesn't really have a happy ending, at least not for everyone. More tragedy is brought upon the town of Pagford and readers really get to see what certain characters are made of. While I enjoyed the ending it did feel a bit rushed and unresolved to me. It was a beautiful ending but I was still left with some questions.<br /><br />This would have been a book that I would have read whether or not J.K. Rowling was the author. I can see why people would be upset or disappointed in this book, especially if they didn't start reading it with an open mind. I enjoyed this book and would be willing to recommend it to others. I would recommend this book to someone who can look past the Harry Potter series and just judge the book on its own merits. Be warned though that this book has some highly adult subjects and children should probably not be reading this.
B008XG1X18|3.0|it sometimes takes 3 or 4 times to open the app.. it says that it needs to force close. once it opens,  I have no complaints but I hope this gets updated and fixed!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I love how she starts out with a romantic notion of a lifetime adventure that within a day turns into the stark reality of what she has committed to do.  Six toenails later, she is a woman with strength and accomplishment behind her and ready to move on. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0007PALZ2|2.0|Ok so Bruce looks fab naked and not afraid to slobber in every scene and act barbaric, guess those goons from the future will do that to ya...  the whole timeline is absurd, conflicting, and arbitrary so I assume the confusion masks the weak script... the long protracted chase scenes were unbearable and just wanted to see more action and lead flying.... a Brad Snatch teaser imho, coulda done w/o his input but a headliner nonetheless...  Madeline looks gorgeous as a blond and Bruce with a wig is hot! incessant discomfort, discord and disorientation makes for commercial yearning.... GEICO! ;}}
B0014DQSGW|5.0|Who knew Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant could be such a duo?? She had me giggling and hooked on her wit and independent nature. Way to be Sandra!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really liked the beginning of this book but once I got half way through it turned into the most ridiculous, unbelievable story line EVER.  Even though I was still engrossed to find out what happened at the end the author completly failed.  Really seems like she just got tired of writing the book and said screw it, the end.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I love this album and all the people that I've played it to from 15 to 50 love it too.<br />It flows really nicely and Mr Cornell's voice is spot on as always. I really rate this work and I've been a Soundgarden and Audioslave (& solo Cornell)<br />fan for 23 years!

B008JH5CVS|4.0|If you are expecting an oscar caliber movie then you deserve to be dissapointed.  However if you are looking for an over the top, fun, action flick, then you will be pleased.  I like to compare this movie with the 80's action flicks, such as the original Total Recall, or Escape from New York.  If you enjoy movies for such as Escape from New York for the sheer fun factor, then you will most likely enjoy this movie.  If you are into movies like Sex & the City or the Devil Wears Prada, this will probably not be your cup of tea.
0525953728|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was humbling to hear what it is like to be a SEAL from the view of a guy who actually is one without the hype of the media or Hollywood.  When this book was first announce, there was a big to do about the SEAL community being upset and the Pentagon not fully vetting the book...  Even Richard Marcinko, the founder of SEAL team 6, wrote a book.<br /><br />Don't expect to read anything in this book classified at any level at all.  \\"Owen\\" loves his country and the men he served too much to even consider doing that.  Most of the tactics described you can see from watching a decent movie that wants to portray accuracy instead of pursue an agenda.  But, it did me good to read how a kid from a small town, who never received anything from this country except freedom, decided in junior high school that he was going to be a SEAL and give his country everything he had and he did it.  It is stunning to read how he and his fellow warriors do just that.
0874160790|1.0|I ordered this book for my child for a class. It looks just like other books, but when you open it, it is pornographic! It contains drawings of people having sex! I was absolutely horrified.I do not recommend this to anyone and thought the seller withheld pertinent information I needed when selecting a book. Shame on you!
0525953728|5.0|The book is an exciting and riveting account of how we finally tracked down the world's most hated man and eliminated him from society.  The world was made a little safer that day.
B00846TTDG|5.0|From a former Military guy, I am always picking apart the finer details concerning military tactics and actions in movies.  I did not have these issues with this movie.  I read other reviews that noted the poor acting.  I would like to point out that the acting is poor in the softer moments of the movie.  However the acting in the action sequences is just fine.  That is where these guys are good and it shows.  They may not be good at pretending, but they are great at the real thing.  I would like to see more movies made with real soldiers.  I can do without the real actors, and would prefer the real thing.  Not a movie that an overpaid Hollywood actor could have pulled off as good as these guys did.  And besides, when the Hollywood actors are getting rewarded at the Oscars, Emmy's, whatever, for their pretending. Stop and think for a moment where these guys are for real at that same moment.  If they even receive an award for the real thing, their awards ceremony will not be televised.  So heres to the SEAL teams, the Navy in general, the Air Force, Coast Guard, Army, and of course Marines everywhere, keep up the good work, you are the real heroes.  You deserve more than the actors do.
B007N0REX6|4.0|Wow. I have to honestly say this album ROCKS and that is a really nice thing in a world inundated with Rap and R&B. Not that I have anything against those 2 musical styles...it's just that the world (America especially) is filled with trendy people who are like rats following the Pied Piper. Whatever is 'in' at the time is what they like. If a certain artist or sound is 'hot'-they like it. I have never subscribed to this mentality. And thank God Slash hasn't either. The same cannot be said for his former GNR partner Axl Rose. We gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited for his new 'GNR' lineup to prove their worth. And we waited. And waited...finally after OVER a decade, we got 'Chinese Democracy'-WTF??? Samples, loops, and SUPER over production with ballad after ballad and nary a rocker in sight. Yes-the opening track rocked a bit, but has more in common with punk than the sleazy R&R we were used to with GNR. The only track that stood out for me was 'Better'. Axl--you have failed us. If it took you THAT long to write and release the album it should have been TRACK AFTER TRACK of masterpieces! Now here comes Slash. While he has been with us all along and released some pretty damn decent stuff-THIS is the definitive album by the man. It is by far the most cohesive album in his solo arsenal. It rocks, it rolls, it has all of the elements that made GNR what it WAS. What Slash needed was a steady singer-not a bunch of 'guests'...and he chose well. I'm sure it had much to do with Myles Kennedy showing his stuff on Slash's last release. In short,'Apocalyptic Love' can be considered the GNR album we have waited almost 15 years for. I won't go into a track by track description because we'd be here all day. All I will say is this is hard rocking music at it's finest with a fantastic vocal performance from Mr. Kennedy. Axl has nothing on this guy! So if your like me and you long for the GNR of yore and you also were majorly let down by that lame 'Guns & Posers' album-don't walk-RUN to the nearest music store and grab this cd! Or just click that mouse right here and now on Amazon-you won't be dissapointed! Thank you Slash!!!
B005LAII8K|5.0|Looper is one of the best films I've seen this year. Maybe just right behind The Dark Knight Rises.<br /><br />Loopers are basically for hire thugs who kill people sent back 30 years by mobsters, since in the future bodies are tagged and can't be desposed of without detection. Then Loopers start getting sent back future version of themselves when they are no longer needed. Let's just say one future Looper remembered what he did 30 years ago to himself and escapes his execution.<br /><br />Joseph Gorden-Levitt turns in a truly memorable lead performance as a young version of the character played by Bruce Willis, who is back in fine form here. Emily Blunt is great too and the child actor who plays her son knocks it out of the park. He goes from funny to scary and back again.<br /><br />It has some minor flaws and time travel is always confusing to totally figure out, but the acting, writing and story are fantastic.<br /><br />Also check out Timecrimes. It came out in 2007 and you have to read subtitles (the dubbing is terrible) but it is a very smart movie that takes many views to put it all together. Or you can be lazy like me and just read all the online theories afterwards.

1451662432|1.0|Self-important, sophomoric drivel. Don't watse your money. This man is a narcissist who only wants fame and recognition. He has no empathy for what he did to his wife and kids., in fact, he boasts about his indiscretions. Save your money for a book about a real man, not this toddler without a moral compass.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I could not have been more dissappointed.  I had very high expectations for this book, after reading great reviews that Ms. Rowling had done it again.  Only this time in an adult market.  Please wait for this to go on sale someplace if you really must buy it.  It is not worth the price or the time out of your daily life that you will lose reading it.<br /><br />Maybe she could go back to the children and YA market.  She seems to understand it better.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Laughable story-line. Be prepared to suspend all disbelief, especially if you have spent more than a day in the military. Where exactly producers find script writers to pen military based stories is a real mystery. The responsible party was utterly incompetent, did no research, or simply didn't have a clue about life in the Armed Forces. If you can manage to get past that large failing, the action is enjoyable. It takes a long time to get to the good though, the viewer must endure horrible attempts at story-telling and background on the characters. It's difficult to care about the the hero; lovable losers don't come off well when they are portraying commissioned officers, it just doesn't work. Taylor Kitsch, who plays Lieutenant Alex Hopper should seriously consider another line a work. Male modeling, maybe?
1594744769|5.0|I began reading what I believed to be the forward to the book but what actually turned out to be the beginning of an extremely spellbinding story. I found the story fascinating and I had a hard time putting it down. With each chapter I couldn't wait to see what mystery was waiting to be discovered in the next successive chapter. I won't reveal the story but I will conclude by saying that at the final sentence of the last chapter I found myself wishing there was more of the story to read. I only hope that author Ransom Riggs comes out with a sequel on the continuing adventures of the peculiar children. An extremely fantastic first book by this writer!

0345525558|4.0|After bouncing around among assorted unpleasant foster homes since infancy, Victoria Jones is now being thrust out into the world (\\"emancipated\\") on her 18th birthday.  Victoria is an angry young woman who flinches at being touched and who believes that she is unable to sustain any sort of bond with another person.  We learn about Victoria's past through alternating chapters that reflect mainly on the year she spent with Elizabeth, a vintner who taught Victoria the language of flowers.  Elizabeth was saintly in her forgiveness of 10-year-old Victoria's many transgressions, which were not slip-ups but intentional acts of meanness.  Victoria outdid herself in the malice that caused her to leave Elizabeth's care, and now, 8 years later, she strikes up a friendship of sorts with Elizabeth's nephew, Grant, who grows flowers to sell to florists like Renata.  Elizabeth's knowledge of flowers and the emotions they are supposed to evoke (jealousy, love, regret, etc.) have landed her some occasional work for Renata.  As she struggles to limit her emotional attachments, Victoria encounters a slew of encouraging and caring people, including Renata, who help guide her through a transition to a woman who can thrive in the real world.  This smattering of friends and mentors seemed a little unlikely, and the storyline is a little too typical for my tastes.  I found Elizabeth's unconditional love of Victoria a bit unbelievable, too, but the author has more experience with foster children than I do, and I'm sure she has the ability to tolerate misbehavior more patiently than I ever could.  Despite these minor drawbacks, the novel is charming.  The most obvious consequence of having read it is that now I'll want to consult a flower dictionary before sending anyone a floral arrangement.

It also tends to stop working and makes you force close mp3.

I would recommend this book to anyone that likes to read on the edge of there seat.

It's the type of book you'd recommend to your friends and others, and certainly one you'd come back to yourself for another read or three.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book; I read it in two sittings, and the only reason I didn't make it in one was because I had to force myself to put it down and at least get some sleep that night. The premise of the book--a girl who has committed suicide leaving tape recordings for those she blames--was really interesting. The format was also intriguing; the narration switches between Hannah (the girl on the tapes) and Clay (the boy listening to them) in real time, so you get to read Clay's reactions to Hannah's stories immediately. It took some getting used to, but once you were accustomed to switching narrators like that, I found the format to be very engaging.<br /><br />I've read reviews from people who dislike the book because Hannah's reasons for committing suicide seem to be so trivial, but I respectfully disagree. I remember what it felt like to be in high school, and I think this book is very true to that experience. The danger with teenagers is that they have no perspective: because they have limited life experience, when something bad happens to them it truly is the worst thing that's ever happened to them in their lives. It can be hard to have perspective when you're in the thick of it, going through something that thus far is the worst thing that's ever happened to you, and you have an entire school of peers watching you go through it and often offering their own commentary. You're also less sure of who you are as a teenager, so it's difficult to deal with a bunch of people in your school trying to tell you who you are and spreading rumors about you: if you hear something about yourself enough times, sometimes you can start to believe it. It's hard, and I can understand the snowball effect of repeated bad experiences that Hannah talks about.<br /><br />The takeaway message of this book: never underestimate the effect, positive or negative, that you can have on someone's life...and if you suspect someone is in trouble, reach out! I think teenagers and young adults will definitely be able to relate to this book, and parents should read it too: it carries an important message!
B008MEM24S|5.0|love it so bge that means best game ever I'm not joking it is the best. o btw there is so many games that rock bfn. see you when I do my next review on games. l8r, brb,
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I highly recommend this product. Season 1 was so awesome and after hearing that Frank Darabont was leaving as Director I was fearful for season 2. Oh me with little faith, season 2 was just as good if not better. I've been a long time fan of the comic book series and to see the details they put into the show from the comics is so mind blowing!!! Also if you're just a big fan of some good ol'fashioned Zombie killing this show is totally for you!!!
B005723JSQ|5.0|Sophie Kinsella/Madeline Wickham is hilarious!! Her books always have me in stitches. I cant wait for the next one to come out!!
B00005214X|5.0|This is a fantastic album I waited far to long to hear.  But maybe it was good to wait for this remastered version given what others said about the first release's sound quality issues. The music is superb, as good as much Beatles music.  In Harrison's catalog, some of his songs are strange, but this entire album is strong. The instrumentals on disc 2 are just fantastic music in terms of guitar work. I'd love to see Brad Paisley record the \\"Jeep\\" number just to see how another eminent guitarist in another genre would put his spin on it.
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|Another formidable piece of work from the master.<br />Although his voice sometimes makes Tom Waites sound like Maria Callas, the album bears many listenings so brace yourself<br />The lyrics will come back to haunt you.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Fun, challenging yet very relaxing, and I love the music that keeps me calm while trying to solve the puzzle.  I would recommend for a real brain exercise.
0525953728|5.0|It's always better to know the truth rather than a lie.  This was a hard book to put down.  Even my wife read it and loved it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know the truth of what actually took place on the raid of Bin Laden's compound.  You won't be disappointed.
B008PE9GSA|2.0|i think they should have stopped recording after afterburner! every thing they do now is repiticious. i've been a fan since fandango came out, they were always my go to music! a minute of silence.....
B004EYSXT8|3.0|Informative book on slow practice and its physiological key process: the formation of myelin around nerve fibers. Convincing because of the good connection to high school knowledge on neurology; on the new insights one has be confident about the sources -- as always in popular science texts. Written in American hallelujah style, but bearable for this European reader.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I was not sure if my baby needed more stimulation especially while sleeping when I purchased this mobile. Thank goodness I did! The soothing nature or classical music is not cheap sounding. The animals are soft and engaging for baby to watch. Nightlight is available if you choose. I found that the combination of the quiet music and gentle animal movement is a great que for bedtime. Sometimes she just watches the animals quietly until she falls asleep. The mobile function did stop working, frustration gallor. However, with one quick request from amazon we had our replacement the NEXT DAY! She is 9 months and still enjoying this mobile as are her parents! =)
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The first thing about this book: It's supposed to be the second half of A Feast of Crows. I guess he was writing that book, but it got too big so he split it into two books. So basically what you get in A Feast of Crows is what you get from A Dance with Dragons. If you thought the story would pick up when A Feast of Crows left off, you know when something interesting finally happened after slogging your way through 1000+ pages of Cersei's inner monologue, you would be mistaken. This is 1000+ pages of other people's inner monologues.<br /><br />Second point, if the above is true, and Mr. Martin realized during the writing of this 2-part book that it would need to be split in two, why is there a 5+ year gap between their publication? My guess is that it was as much a chore to write as it is to read. And it is a big chore.<br /><br />However, it's a great story with compelling characters and everything is now in place for a really spectacular finish. I give it three stars with a one star bonus being awarded as a show of goodwill for how spectacular the first three books were and the potential that remains for the finals books.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is a great source for news, one of the most unbiased regarding opinion,in line with the BBC outstanding quality of programming. The app works well, plenty of images and well fitting pages.<br />The only issue i could remark is that they tend to give more attention to the english speaking world, and specially to the commonwealth and former british colonies. But that is something one can understand, specially considering is paid with the UK tax payers money.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Go see them if you have a chance:<br /><br />I would five this 5 stars also because of what David Lee Roth did even in his early days and this is by far in my opinion the best Van Halen album out of them all, I just saw a tribute band called the Atomic Punks at the OC Fairgrounds that are a pretty good rendition of the first 6 albums by Van Halen and they tore it up on a few of the older songs and the lead singer even said that Fair Warning was his favorite album.<br /><br /> I want to see Van Halen release a LIVE DVD double set of the early stuff because after they cancelled most of thier last tour I think that they're now sort of washed up since Michael Anthony won't rejoin the band and says he's through with it. Also and even when the host of That Metal Show told him that he ought to get his old Jack Daniels bass guitar back from the Music Hall of Fame. I miss those days but they're gone now.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|The XX albums are not available in Turkey. It is impossible to find and buy one. I was able to purchase all of their albums and they were delivered to me earlier than I expected. I really satisfied with the service Amazon.com provided.
8866131369|4.0|Like the hard cover - well made and slim enough to fit into a small tote's side pocket. Wish it had a full page monthly calendar for all 18 months.
0321714113|5.0|If you have some programming background and are trying to learn C++, are an intermediate developer, or even if you're an advanced developer - this book is highly recommended reading.<br /><br />In my opinion, this book teaches C++ properly, it teaches you the building blocks and facilities of the language from the ground up so you get accustomed to strings, vectors and other important features of the C++ standard library. This is exactly what Bjorne Stroustroup, the creator of the language, suggests and I find it so much more useful than starting off by learning the C programming language first.<br /><br />This book covers C++11 features in an in depth fashion. Prior to having this book, I had a hard time finding enough information about all the aspects of the new standard. I especially like the explanation on rvalue references and the new move semantics.<br /><br />Parts 3 and 4 of the book were particularly useful. Part 3 delves into copy semantics, the new move semantics, and includes a great chapter on object oriented programming.<br /><br />Part 4 is also a treat as it's focused on regular expressions, random numbers, formatted IO, tools for large programs such as exception handling, namespaces and more.<br /><br />This is my personal C++ book recommendation, along with \\"The C++ Standard Library\\" which is also updated to include C++11 and \\"API Design for C++\\" .
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I was concerned about purchasing a used set of videos. The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was that it looked brand new. The second thing surprised me . . . a note to please contact them if there was any problem. No problems.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book - can't wait until Reflected in You comes out! I find this series to be a little more practical than 50 Shades - although 50 Shades was awesome as well! :)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|i absolutely love this game! i hope there is more like this! it is so interesting and terrifying at the same time!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Yet another great reacher read. Good plot twists keep pages turning fast. Picks up right where the last one left off.
0316228532|1.0|I had promised myself I would read at least 50 pages before I decided anything about this book because it took me that long to get into Harry Potter.  I didn't last that long.  I don't care for bad language and I didn't actually like most of the characters introduced at the first of the book.  Then I read the last chapter in case there was any redeeming qualities that would make me go back to read the rest.  There weren't.  I almost bought the book and am so glad I didn't. (sorry Amazon)
B008PE9GSA|3.0|The hype surrounding this album has been a little bit overboard, in my opinion. ZZ Top's first album in 9 years. Rick Rubin produced it. There were several tries and failed attempts in creating this. Finally, it hits stores on September 11th (kinda weird to release an album that day, but oh well.). So, is it the righteous return to blues that we've heard on classics like Rio Grande Mud, Tres Hombres, and Fandango?<br /><br />No. Not really.<br /><br />If you've heard Mescalero, you've pretty much heard this album. This album sounds like Mescalero, which sounded like XXX, which sounded like Rythmeen, which sounded like Antenna, and so on. At this point in their career, don't expect a huge experiment in ZZ Top's formula. It's not like we're going to see them embracing dubstep any time soon.<br /><br />That being said, the album is....alright. We've already heard the first four songs months before, so putting them back to back was kinda redundant and a little bit of a dissapointment. I Gotsa Get Paid is probably the best out of the EP, a rewriting of 25 Lighters with that ZZ Top fuzz we've all come to expect. Chartreuse boogies like 1975, and reminds me of Tush in a lot of ways. Consumption sounds like any song on the last 4 or 5 albums. We've heard this before, we know what to expect. The hooks are good, the playing is good, so on and so forth.<br /><br />However, there's a few missteps. Over You is just a bland hookless ballad that goes on and on. Not a big fan of ZZ Top slowing things down to a crawl. It worked well in the early days with Sure Got Cold After The Rain Fell and Old Man, but after that, whenever ZZ does a ballad, it's sure to stink. Also, I don't quite get It's Too Easy Manana. The lyrics are weird, and it just bogs the album down. Might've worked well on a Gillian Welch album with acoustic instrumentation (She wrote the song), but not on here.<br /><br />That being said, the rest of the album is standard ZZ fare. Heartache In Blue has some awesome harmonica interplay with the band, and Flying High, while not as good as the demo version that came before, still packs a punch. Nothing too amazing on this album, just the goods, fair and plain.<br /><br />Is it something that I'll come back to time and time again? Probably not. But a good ZZ Top album in 2012 sure beats a lot of other bands' works these days, especially this far in their career. Check it out if you're a fan.monica interplay with the band, and Flying High, while not as good as the demo version that came before, still packs a punch.

0765348276|4.0|\\"Old Man's War\\" will bring to mind for many people, \\"Starship Troopers.\\"  But in \\"Old Man's War\\" one must be 75 years old to enlist.  The recruits do not really understand what is coming their way, and that suspense adds a lot to the enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />I will try not to offer spoilers.<br /><br />The characters are well developed, and the action is explained in good detail, without being too overly graphic.  But it is war, remember.<br /><br />The dialogue is well written and seems realistic.  The advances in technology are not overwhelmingly explained, but described with enough detail to feel real, without feeling like a science lecture.<br /><br />Solid and engaging plot.  Climax is adequate, but a bit abrupt.<br /><br />Overall, a solid B+ novel.  I am planning on reading the next ones in the series.  \\"The Ghost Brigades\\" and what follows.
0439023521|5.0|I had never even heard of this book that had taken the Young Adult world by storm until I saw the movie trailer. I love that type of social science fiction so I looked into it and discovered the book, yeah.. i was a little behind. With all the hype behind it I was didn't get my hopes up but I was happily surprised. From the very first sentence I was captivated. The writing style is simple(remember its for YA) yet poignant. I was also pleased as a women to read about such a strong female protagonist. Often when you have a female hero lead she is still very girly and perfect so it was refreshing to have such a solid, yet humanly flawed, real female hero. The story is riveting, and once you actually get to the \\"games\\" you will not be able to put the book down, you will worry for your beloved main characters and wish you could help them. Thats how powerful the writing and the story are.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|The product itself was the correct CD and all but one of the tracks was in excellent condition, however, one track was defective, would not play correctly and so I had to return it.  That said, the tracks that worked were great music, just as I remember from the video of the concert for which this is the sound track.  It has all of his wonderful hits, a must for RO fans and also for those that want to be.
B005URRCUY|4.0|I've never seen an album so divided in opinion than The Black Keys' 7th release, El Camino. All the major review sites and magazines seem to give it glowing rave reviews, calling it one of the most exciting rock records of 2011. However, all the Keys fans that followed them up to this point have been trashing this album, with cries of \\"sell out,\\" and even \\"Danger Mouse produced crap.\\" Seems like there isn't a consistent opinion about this record.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I was a bit turned off at first by this record too. I have been following The Black Keys for about 10 years now, pretty much from when they started as a little known Akron blues band with a really good debut on their sleeves. The first 4 albums pretty much follow that dirty hill country blues formula, with a penchant for heavy guitar, fantastic performances, and some pretty catchy hooks to boot. Then there was the dividing point with 2008's Attack & Release, a record I still don't really care for outside of a few good songs. Brothers changed that for me though, a dense record with some of the best songs you'll ever hear from the Akron duo.<br /><br />Now, there's El Camino, and things have changed yet again. The hill country influence has faded a little bit. The production is booming. There's added instrumentation. There's even female backing singers. So much has changed since that little known debut in 2002. But, as I said before, all things must change. Bands evolve. Look at Radiohead, do you really want them to play the post-grunge they were embracing on Pablo Honey? Give this album some time, it will grow on you.<br /><br />And grow on me it did. All the songs are short, sweet, and to the point. And man, do they rock. The 3-song punch of Lonely Boy, Dead & Gone, and Gold On The Ceiling just never fails to excite me. All these songs just bounce, rip and roar, the latter being my favorite: A T-rex style boogie with some great fuzzy guitar.<br /><br />Little Black Submarines is just epic. A nice acoustic sad song turned into a Tom Petty-esque rocker. You just have to hear it to believe it.<br /><br />And the rest of the album is just so damn dancy and funky. They know how to slide in a great hook while still retaining their energy and the fuzz of earlier releases. I don't really see this as a huge departure if you've been following them up to this point. I just see them blossoming as songwriters and as a kicking rock band.<br /><br />So, I don't really understand the hate, but if you're looking for a good new rock and roll album, this is the one to get. Keep on rolling, guys.acoustic sad song turned into a Tom Petty-esque rocker. You just have to hear it to believe it.<br /><br />And the rest of the album is just so damn dancy and funky.

However, it's free.  I'm going to purchase the for sale version.  It is sure to be worth the small cost.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|I was in the 10th grade when this album came out. Well one day in debate class, our teacher decided to discuss whether or not Madonna was dangerous or was she pushing art forward. The class was completely polarized.<br /><br />Some of my classmates called her a slut and I just about outed myself in her defense.<br /><br />Off of the strength of the Erotica single I bought this record the day it came out and I can say that it is her magnum opus. Don't misunderstand me, I am very much a fan of older Madonna catalogues but I feel like every album up till that point was working towards the result of this album--a daring, adventurous album that she wouldn't have been pulled off if she hadn't pulled out all stops and given herself fully to its significance. Which she certainly did.<br /><br />Along with her Sex Book, this album did not ask for anyone's permission to grant her the right to be explicitly sexual or to allow her to realize a full-throttle expression of what it means to whip away at America's prudish ideas of what is deemed taboo. In Erotica, she solidified her convictions as a gay ally and an artist less concerned with record sales than releasing a record that would help to widen the crack in our society of fake moralism and unwarranted bigotries.<br /><br />More than that it is a complex album with introspective and imaginative ruminations. Has there ever been a sadder song than Bad Girl, my favorite track on the album? Deeper and Deeper is actually a story about a boy who is coming to accept his own homosexuality and though this may seem like a very specific demographic, it can also be related to anyone searching for a truer distillation of self.<br /><br />I can go on and on.<br /><br />Erotica has aged very well. It still sounds, in 2012, just as dark, edgy and subversive as when I first bought it all those years ago. This is the Madonna I fought for as a 15 year old in debate class who saw something in her gesture that I could relate to even though I wasn't yet aware of the provocative, experimental, introspective life I had yet to claim.n't yet aware of the provocative, experimental, introspective life I had yet to claim.

B0058YPGVQ|5.0|We love this DVD. We had been following this series the first couple of seasons and then schedules were so we missed a couple of seasons. My husband enjoys watching the seasons continuously instead of waiting weekly for one show. We watched season 3 & 4 consecutively and are psyched for season 5 (on DVD) of course.
0142403873|5.0|We bought this one based on the success of \\"Room on the Broom\\" by the same author and illustrator, and were not disappointed. Our 2-year-old boy loves the singsong quality of the writing, points out all the little details in the images (spider! mushroom!), and typically asks us to read it at least 3x a day. Definitely a hit in our household!

B004WR125O|3.0|This adapter allows your Onkyo receiver to connect to Wi-Fi.  Why?  I don't know.  Most TVs and Satellite providers provide you with a means to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi, so why the receiver, too?  Updates?  Onkyo receivers seem to have a problem downloading updates via their Wi-Fi adapter (actually recommends you plug in an Ethernet cable).  So, if you don't have any other devices in your setup that do Wi-Fi, and you needed that connectivity, this would be the cheapest option.<br /><br />If you wished your Onkyo did Airplay with your Mac, buy an Airport Express, and plug in an audio Y-cable.  For $99, you now have audio Airplay.  While you're at it, plug an Ethernet cable from your Onkyo to the Express, and you have an Internet-connected receiver.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|Most of the Reacher books are based on coincidences that are hard to take.  Somehow, Reacher is out in the world, drifting from place to place and he just happens, through no effort of his own, to get caught up in the middle of a vast conspiracy that he alone destroys and -- obviously -- survives so that there will be a next Reacher novel.  We expect this and even welcome it, because we like to watch him wreak utter havoc on the arrogant but inept tough guys and gangsters he meets up with.  Wanted Man pushes it just a tad too far.  On the one hand it's formulaic, but on the other hand challenges our suspension of disbelief.  The twists and turns of the plot seem forced.  Why, for instance, are the bad guys also such bad shots, at least while shooting at Reacher as opposed to a secondary character?  And the evil conspiracy seems a little much obvious for it not to have been rolled up by the Feds long before Reaher reaches it.  Not the worst book in the world, a quick read, but it left me with a fast-food empty calorie feeling.  I think the best ones jump off from his army background and reconnect him with army buddies and antagonists.  This one really didn't and didn't advance the story of his connecting to the Virginia woman he has been trying to connect with -- a meeting that Child has been avoiding for a couple of books now.

B003XKAZKO|5.0|This CD sent me on a lifelong journey.  I think it's his desert-island disk.  Might be my favorite CD of all time.<br /><br />If this came with no bonus tracks, I'd still rate it a 10.  The bonus tracks are ridiculously amazing.  It's remastered, so that alone is worth the extra $.<br /><br />Judge this CD on the original content.<br /><br />It's his best CD by far.<br /><br />Many/most of these songs were played on his 1991 tour (what's a better word than stunningly amazing?).  It's how many people discovered his genious.<br /><br />Don't know what else I can say, but this CD blows me away.

B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Any one who has ever taught will be fascinated by this book. It is solidly based on science and current brain research. This book would be a marvelous summer read for all teachers in a school as in-service work for the next year could all be based on a common understanding of this book. Goal setting could come out of discussions.

0738212415|3.0|When I bought this book I was thinking it would show more things along the lines of how to draw facial features.<br />But when I received the book this morning I was sad to see that about only six pages covered the topic of facial features, only a basic eye, eyebrow, and two faces.<br />Most of this I have already known but it's still a very good book for people that can't draw to save their lives.
0756666937|5.0|As soon as I took out this book, one of my kids jumped on it.  All of them loves Lego and can build for hours when motivated especially when there is a contest (see below for more details!).  When I got this book, I seriously thought that it would contain step-by-step ideas for the kids to explore and develop their Lego skills.  Ah!  I was so wrong.  This book is not an idea book but more like a book that unfolds the story of Lego as a company and the brick itself!<br /><br />Literally  it is a  trip down memory lane...  As soon as I skipped through the pages, I could identify some of the Lego package I have received when I was younger in the 70s (and I still have the blocks and instructions believe it or not!) Now my own kids plays with them!  *grin*<br /><br />The book starts with how it is a family business and how Lego became a trademark toy over the years.  Back in 1974, I believe that it wasn't easy to find Lego toys in Canada but in the years that followed the famous boxes found their way on the Canadian market.  You will also get a timeline to discover what major products were developed in what year.  You will also have the opportunity to read more about the patent and the brick itself, learn when the first of some of the elements came out on the market and discover how the Lego bricks are made.<br /><br />Once you have gone through history and discover how they are made, you will explore the pages where the various play themes are presented.  Then you will discover the amazing creativity of the people who helped to put Legoland together.  These pages have brought major reactions from my kids.  Now my dream is to bring my kids to LegoLand in Florida and even to the one in Denmark where everything started.<br /><br />In the book, you will also get to learn about the Lego Master Builders which has definitively picked the interest of Dominic.<br /><br />Lego fans will love to learn more about the history of the famous brick as well as discover the play sets that were created through the years.  I am pleased to have this book in the house because it motivates my child to read more.t were created through the years.

0525952926|5.0|Winter of the World is what a book ought to be--well written, full of memorable characters, well researched, cleverly plotted, unforgetable, and one you are sorry to come to the end of, all 960 pages of it. For the past several days, I have looked forward to my time with this novel and enjoyed every minute of it. It not only entertains, it educates, and it etches itself in our memory. It becomes like a good friend we look forward to spending time with and regret when we have to part. This second of the trilogy, the first being Fall of Giants, begins in the thirties and tracks the rise of Hitler in Germany. The way Follett intertwines the the five families--German, Russian, Welsh, English and American--and weaves them into the events of detailed and moving history is pure genius. With the keenest of research and detail, it moves through the European front in World War II and expands to the far reaches of the Pacific conflict. It becomes not just a history, but a living history. If you like to read a good book written by a master writer, this is a choice for you. I enjoyed every word of Winter of the World and look forward to the third of the series. The first two volumes are both highly recommend. These days it's hard to find good books like Follett writes.
B004H1U2HE|5.0|I love Amos Oz's writing anyway, but because this book it his memoir, his language is all the more immediate and touching, so I love it all the more.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I watched this on DVD, feeling a bit put out that I hadn't seen it on the big screen.<br /><br />By the end of it, I felt even WORSE because it's so great! Maybe if it had featured 'Mars' in the title, to attract those who knew nothing of him, or who'd missed the previews, it could've drawn more people. And maybe it could've lost about ten minutes, to bring it well under two hours.<br /><br />But those minor quibbles do not detract in any way from the greatness of this film.<br /><br />Clearly, I had fallen prey to bad press leading up to the cinematic release. I see a lot of films and the high prices mean I have to let one or two slip by.<br /><br />This is what happens. A few bad reviews are written, often by people who don't ever like these kinds of films. Then they're replicated around the world, ad nauseum, via the internet. Some news websites often employ people who sit at desks and do no more than rewrite what's already 'out there'. They call themselves 'journalists'-- they're really little more than copy boys.<br /><br />So what a handful of reviewers said-- stacked on top of the high cost of the movie-- created a negative 'buzz'. Reviewers who follow are affected by this. They don't want to go against the grain because they don't want to be seen as out of the loop, or out of their minds.<br /><br />Then people who have never seen the film, and have no intention of doing so, join in via blogs and online forums and social media. Before long, you end up with a mass of negative opinion that it's almost impossible to combat. The net is infamous for allowing complete strangers to kick someone or something while it's down.<br /><br />This is what occured with the Green Lantern movie. It had awesome special effects, and was resonably true to the comic. It was not as good as Thor but it was pretty damn great; certainly better than the re-booted Spiderman. But it too was affected by overwhelmingly negative coverage-- again, by people who hadn't stepped foot in the cinema.<br /><br />I can only wonder what it's like to be part of making a stunning film, months and years of work, only to have it shot down by people who largely don't know what they're on about.<br /><br />People need to be smarter when they're considering what a good film is, and whether they want to see it. I've learned my lesson.<br /><br />I think that in the future, John Carter will be seen as one of the classic science fiction films of the 2010s.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I would have gave it 5 stars if I wasn't always running out of coins! It is a fun game just like the real machines. But I get bored waiting for more coins!!!!!

B0083SBJXS|5.0|I was worried that this movie was biting off more than it could chew with so many actors in one story line.<br />But it was one of the best movies that I have seen since the first Iron Man. PS Don't stop watching until the last credits are done, ;).

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I wasn't particularly excited about watching John Carter after watching the previews, it seemed just another special-effects laden Disney romp without much substance.  What made me watch it was the fact that it received higher ratings than any other recent release, and after watching it I can understand why.  John Carter is a film an audience can connect with from children to adults.  It is witty, charming, and heartwarming with an unexpected twist.  I was surprised to find myself sympathizing with John Carter and even touched at a few of the scenes.  The plot developed nicely with a good bit of character development along the way.  John Carter proved to be satisfying in every way, a must watch!

B000I8G5B2|5.0|One of my favorite movies. With so many medical advancements the world of Gattaca no longer seems that far away. As someone predisposed to so many ailments with a bleak family history I love this movie's message that your genes are not your fate and believing in yourself still reigns over all odds even in the future.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|I don't know why people have been saying that the controls are bad, I'm playing it on a Kindle Fire HD and they work just fine. The graphics are amazing, and I am really enjoying the new zones.  The game is not so hard that it's frustrating, but not so easy that it lacks challenge. First boss is pretty simple, though, not sure why a previous reviewer said it was super hard.
B00003CX5P|2.0|With 16 years between \\"Return of the Jedi\\" and this prequel, it was natural the hype would be huge among all avenues of media and especially with the many millions of Star Wars fans around the world. I remember being very excited from the moment I saw the first teaser trailer and the excitement continued to build until I was sitting in the theater among many other fans. The opening music and text started, the people cheered then unfortunately the movie officially started.<br /><br />Having felt incredible disappointment after the movie ended I and a lot of the fans left just in a fog of how bummed we all were. Since that viewing I've watched the film 3 more times to see if my opinion changed at all and no it has not, and there are a few reasons why.<br /><br />First the good of the movie, the music by John Williams is top notch, the closing music and the \\"Duel of the Fates\\" song during the final lightsaber fight are truly great pieces. The special effects for that time were nice and cool.<br /><br />Unfortunately thats about where the good points stop, the bad is plentiful. Firstly is Jar Jar Binks, many others have said how annoying he was and I can't stress this enough. I can only imagine he was created as a way to entertain kids but most of his antics and lines just made me want to scream out loud at him. The dialogue was quite bad and really just bland on many levels, in fact one of the first lines by Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) sums up the movie \\"I have a bad feeling about this\\".<br /><br />The acting is especially disappointing, Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) really just says his lines and doesn't have much in the way of character development or connection to anyone he interacts with especially Obi-Wan and a young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). McGregor is I guess ok as Obi-Wan but really doesn't do much, Lloyd is one actor who even as a kid was just bad, mind numbingly, brain hurting bad, his lines aren't good and he can't seem to read them even half right to save his life. Natalie Portman who is a fantastic actress I might add, was so bland and boring as the Naboo Queen Amidala, which was pretty sad to see as she actually can act but the dialogue didn't help showcase that.<br /><br />Jar Jar's race, the Gungans make the Ewoks from \\"Return of the Jedi\\" seem fun and fesh and not terribly annoying and hair ripping irritating like the animated Gungan race is. None of the humor really works, the only really decent actor in the movie is R2-D2 who conveys more emotion through his series of blips and beeps than most of the cast does combined. The battle droids are especially irritating both voice wise and by their lack of fighting skills and aim, which makes the Storm Troopers seem like a hardened battalion of fighters in comparison.<br /><br />The action sequences are even dull, the pod race portion takes forever and isn't in the least bit exciting, the only thrill comes when the race is finally over. The lightsaber fights are even mundane even the final one with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan facing a red/black face painted Sith named Darth Maul (Ray Park), who is so evil almost no lengthy screen time is devoted to him. Who needs backstory when you have facepaint and a two edged lightsaber?<br /><br />I just remember being so bored and angry watching what should've been a very good and thrilling entry into the Star Wars series, turned into this tripe by creator George Lucas who really, really phoned it in on this one. When the bad outweighs the good by that much its better to watch this movie only to mock it since beyond all the technical staff that put who knows how much time into the effects, along with the John Williams score, there seemed to be zero emphasis on dialogue, story or any good acting. *1/2 out of 4 stars.e.

B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I was so hoping to be able to give this outing of the Marvel universe five stars, but I'm afraid I just can't. Not that there is anything wrong with the actual film. Far from it. But by its very nature, it has insurmountable obstacles which would automatically deminish its potential, despite anything anyone might do with it.<br /><br />For one thing, if you ever were a fan of the Marvel comic books, you know that this time out you are seeing is a once-a-year annual edition, rather than a regular story. In any regular issue the story would focus on one particular plot or threat or through-line and the struggle to overcome that single problem allowed the characters to explore various aspects of their lives and personalities. In the Annual issue, the entire idea was to cram it as full of \\"neat stuff\\" as possible, rather than tell a linear story. It was in the annual's that such fan questions as \\"if Hulk met Thor, who would win?\\" got addressed, not as some necessary part of the main plotline, but just for fun. And that's what goes on here... the fun.<br /><br />Basically it's an almost three hour long fireworks show. It's amazing, thrilling, even mind-blowing. But after a while, fireworks, no matter how individually impressive, are still just fireworks. A couple hours into the show, you're going to experience shell shock and your ability to react emotionally is going to shut down. That's what happens in Avengers. You just never get all that emotionally involved, simply because there's so much going on, so much action, so many complex relationships, that it's overkill. All you really do is buckle in for the numerous action sequences, and those are absolute gold.<br /><br />I found two other flaws with the film, however.<br /><br />From time to time, it didn't seem to be able to decide if it wanted to be taken seriously, to make the crises genuinely moving, or it just wanted to be a wacky cartoon. Joss (as writer/director) makes a couple of poor choices with moments thatcould have helped pull the audience in emotionally, totally sabotaguing them. One example is late in the film where Hulk and Thor are banging away at each other, then join together to take on a massive alien flying worm creature, succeeding in killing it. But at the moment where it crashes to the ground and dies, leaving the two heroes atop its body in triumph, Joss chose to throw in a sight gag (Hulk punching Thor sideways) that is clearly out of a Warner Brothers cartoon. So a moment where we might have seen a bit of some kind of bonding between these battling characters is totally shattered in favor of a cheap, quick laugh. There are a number of those moments throughout the film that slap against any possibility of trying to take things emotionally seriously.<br /><br />The other weakness is the early sniping the heroes do at each other. Although it is intended to show that they are loners, egocentric and unable to bond into a cohesive unit, the dialogue is actually so witty, clever and engaging, that it all comes off like a group of friends playing \\"the Dozens\\" (that game where you hurl insults at one another.) There is no sense that these guys can't get along, or that there is any dangerous tension between them. It reads a lot more like Bing Crosby/Bob Hope banter in one of their Road pictures. Not that it's bad in any way. It's brilliant dialogue, heaps of fun to watch. But supposedly one of the main dramatic themes is the very \\"loner\\" nature of these characters and their inability to work together. At no time do you get a sense that, if one of them pushes a single inch further all hell is going to break loose, and that is what is needed to drive home the point... the Avengers were rejected by the Powers That Be because they can't work together effectively. Even a very few moments where those confrontations really looked like things were going to break into violence due to egos or annoyance would have adequetly reinforced that necessary sense that the Avengersare not going to work as a team, but no such moments exist because Joss's writing is just too darn good and engaging.<br /><br />Other than those few weaknesses, more a product of the very basic nature and sheer size of the piece, the Avengers is a high concept romp through a theme park of thrills. Since I first saw it three days ago, I've watched it four times, always finding tiny little additional nuggets to enjoy each time. This is one to buy and keep in the DVD jukebox rotation.<br /><br />One final comment. If Joss set out to make every guy in the audience fall hopelessly in love with Gweneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts, he succeeded. The by-play between her and Stark when Agent Coulson comes by is absolute bliss. I want one for Christmas.
1439163154|1.0|James Franco does not want to be considered an actor. He wants to be considered a polymath and an \\"artist.\\" He is enrolled in something like six highly prestigious graduate programs, including one for filmmaking, one for fiction, one for poetry, one for design, one for creative writing, and a couple for English literature. You would think this would qualify him to write a book.<br /><br />But there's a problem. The planet's brightest students have to crawl over broken glass to complete one of these graduate programs. How is it possible that Franco can do six at the same time? There are several possibilities. Maybe Franco really is the second coming of Leonardo da Vinci. But here's a line from one of his short stories: \\"The building is beige, but the shadows make it shadow-color.\\" So maybe not.<br /><br />It's more likely that Franco is riding some sort of grotesque wave of snowballing prestige, one that attempts to shield him from his quite evident averageness. It's been said that his classmates feel protective of him. In other words, they like him, they're charmed by him, they're pleased to have him in their midst, and they want to shield him from the fact that he's in a million miles over his head.<br /><br />Franco is unique, but in a totally typical way. He is the cartoonish example of the high-achieving young person who takes 15 AP classes and does 20 extracurriculars in order to look impressive and gain status and admission and acceptance. But it isn't possible to do that many things with any sort of skill or competence. The result is a book that is so vapid and soulless and contrived as to be hard to look at.

0062124293|4.0|This book should really be looked at as a modern feminist bible.  Though I don't completely agree with every single thing Caitlin Moran tells the reader, it's much more straight-forward, free-thinking, and honest than anything else out there.  Girls in college should read this, not cosmo!  As a young woman, dealing with many, most..pretty much all of the things that she discusses in this book, it's really relatable to me.<br /><br />The writer is hilarious, the book can drag on, but what person who truly believes in something can't talk about it for hours on end?  Really passionate writing, with some humor thrown in there.  It made me laugh out loud a few times actually, and that says a lot.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is a fun page turner. It is for pure enjoyment and the pleasure of reading. It is not as nasty bad as some make it out to be.

0525953728|5.0|All of the publicity about the government threatening to prosecute the author over \\"secrets\\" revealed in this book made it a TOP priority for my reading list - anything Big Brother is thinking of BANNING, I want to have in my library! I empathized with the authors because I am the author of a similarly controversial book titled [[ASIN:1411624521 Land of Childhood's Fears - Faith, Friendship, and The Vietnam War]]  about the Vietnam War that you can buy right here on Amazon. Unlike Owen, I did not permit any \\"editing\\" of my book's content... it went right to the publisher.    I had a Top Secret / Crypto / SSIR clearance in the USAF, and I know the rules about classified information. The details of a mission are classified, but are no longer of any use to the enemy AFTER the mission is completed.... and so the government's claim that what was in Mark Owen's book could damage National Security sent my \\"BS meter\\" off the scale. The government has banned books - and even destroyed first printings -  ( see: [...] ) in order to supress things they don't want the public to know. There was even a FAILED attempt to censor MY Web site at [...] because I exposed corruption in a New York State prison system (they tried to cover it up even AFTER it was exposed in the courts) - and I even acted as a \\"Confidential Informant\\" for the NY State Medicaid Fraud Unit. So I knew from whence the persecution of Mark Owen came. I just HAD TO HAVE the book before Mark Owen was sent to Leavenworth on bogus charges to see what all the hoopla was about.    I found that the book - although no \\"secrets\\" that could damage National Security were revealed (that I could find) - exceeded my expectations. The author gives a detailed catharsis on what led up to his becoming a Navy Seal, and in a way someone who has served his country in the military can immeditely relate to.    Books of this kind are exceedingly rare, and authors of this caliber are even more scarce. The account of the mission to take out Osama bin Laden - who I personally believe had NOTHING to do with the attacks on September 11; which in light of Operation Northwoods (revealed on my Web site along with copies of the SECRET government documents to prove it), and the recent \\"Fast & Furious\\" scandal.... the account of the mission will have you sweating with your heart pounding. I read the book in one sitting.  Then I read it again.... over the course of a few days.... so I could mentally \\"process\\" what I just read.    If you only have time to read ONE book this year, then get \\"No Easy Day\\".

B007MB5OCE|5.0|Easy to read, irresistible characters and a great adventure story about a 100-year-old man. If you're wondering how someone this old could get into this much trouble just by climbing out of a window and disappearing, you just have to refer to the flashbacks that reveal his amazing globe-trotting life. Yes, it's rather Forrest Gumpish, but it gives us Americans a broader view of some of the most significant world events over the last century - from the European point of view. A fun and absorbing read!

The first woman was too busy raising children, and cleaning up after them to have time to watch water drip onto rocks, so of course it was a man.<br /><br />It's hard to even consider what time is and what it would mean to be the first person to start measuring it.  What Mitch Albom does, is to suppose that he can get into the mind of the first person to measure something that has no substance, and after doing so, consider the consequences of that act.  What a mind-boggling subject to write a book on.  And how smart would you have to be to write on the subject of time, and to put it into a concept that anyone could understand, acted out by characters that the reader could come to love and care about.  I'm totally impressed.<br /><br />Like Richard Bach, who wrote the wonderful book, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, Albom takes us on a journey of discovery.  After reading this short, 222 page book, I can no longer think of time in the same way.  Which is, to take it for granted.  I've heard that since we've had our minds opened up by computers, and so the Internet, our time has actually speeded up.  Consider that the Bible tells us that 'less this time be shortened, all will parish'(excuse my paraphrasing).<br /><br />Has time become more precious or less so, because we can measure it.  By measuring time, we feel as though we're always running out, while living by the seasons, we'd feel like we had large chunks of time(4 to be exact) and so we'd slow our lives down enough to maybe enjoy them more.  At least that's what The Time Keeper is hinting at.  Good philosophical question to consider.  I'm glad we have writers around like Mitch Albom to ask them.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|A lot of people are bitching about this release but seriously, It's a mass marketed zombie head. It looks cool on my display case, the blu-rays are great, the extras are awesome, and I am totally happy playing around $65 on a pre-order!<br /><br />If you can get your hands on one for about that price, just do it.
0525423656|2.0|This middle book unfortunately turned out to be middle of the road for me.  I truly enjoyed its predecessor, Matched, and I eagerly looked forward to seeing how Cassia would develop further in book two.  Sadly, I think she went stagnant.  I know middle books often act as bridges, but wow, characters can hop off the bridge at some point, right?  With a limited number of major players, very few twists, and little character development, Crossed turned out to be a prettily written, but ultimately, superfluous book in the trilogy.  And trust me, I am very disappointed that it was as I thought Cassia was turning into someone more awesome in the first book.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I don't need all my female leads to be full of charisma and feel they are **different**.  I like the quiet girls with invisible steel.  In book one, it seemed like Cassia was gaining a growing awareness of her world, its origins and limitations.  While her confusion and attractions to both Ky and Xander were very significant parts of the story, I thought that storyline paralleled Cassia's growth as a character and her burgeoning dissatisfaction with the Society.  The bulk of Crossed was made predominately of her quest to find Ky.  The other part of the book focuses on her and the other characters' ponderings about the rebellion against the Society, called the Rising, and its fabled leader, the Pilot.<br /><br />The 'yea' things about the book are the alternating first-person points-of-view from Ky and Cassia.  Loved hearing Ky's thoughts directly from him and learning a bit more about his background and secrets.  However, the lack of action mixed with Condie's lovely and lyrical prose made most of the book feel anti-climatic and seem like a serious study on constant introspection.  Almost EVERY LITTLE THING said was thought upon by either Ky or Cassia.  So, if Ky said paragraph A in Cassia's chapter, then Cassia in turn thought about it, and often, it was simply a reinterpretation of whatKy already said, as if she was retelling herself so she could really soak it in.  And vice versa when it was Ky's chapters.  A little of this is lovely, particularly with Condie's soft and impressionistic writing style.  A book full of this understated narrative with a steady and quiet plot made for dull reading at times.<br /><br />I will still read book three.  I've read the first two, and I want to know what happens.  I realize that three books is a nice number for a series, but like Lauren DeStefano's Wither, I think the plot of the entire series would have been better served if it was limited to two books.  At the very least, I think Crossed could have been shortened, thus creating a more urgent and exciting plot while keeping Condie's lyrical writing in tact.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|But the ending left me wanting more. Expected more romance too. Otherwise a very enjoyable spin on the well-loved fairy tale. Empowers Snow White and rescinds the label of damsel in distress.

0738711500|5.0|This is the book every tarot reader must have. I have read many books on tarot. This book makes it so joyful, trust me, you will not put it down till you finish.  Ciro Marchetti's gilded tarot deck is wonderful. Pictures are offshoot of rider Waite deck, but more colourful and artistic.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|First, to address the poor reviews starting with lines like \\"I've been a fan since 1972 and haven't liked an album they've put out since they abandoned the blues ..\\" This is similar to the legions of Dylan fans still buying every album he releases but bemoaning the fact that he isn't singing \\"Blowing In The Wind\\" anymore. Deal with it. There's a reason \\"Eliminator\\" was a massively successful album and it can't all be chocked up to people having taste for sh*t.<br /><br />That said, Futura is no Eliminator, but it's a solidly catchy and up-tempo effort whose hooks and riffs stick with you after just a few spins. If you're a fan of the Top and want a good late night groove CD or something to put on in the living room after you've tapped the keg, you could do a heck of a lot worse. On the other hand, if you're a purist who only wants to discuss beard changes since 'Tres Hombres' and the influence of Lightnin' Hopkins then maybe it's time to move on. Whether influenced by pop, blues or Houston streets these guys make a sound unique to themselves and aren't afraid to give the people what they want performing live.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was truly one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I usually have at least two books that I am reading, but when I started this one, I could not put it down.  The premise is obvious, but how it is achieved is a masterpiece. It is gripping, funny, sad, and nostalgic in a good way.  The ending is not at all what the reader will imagine when the story begins.  It made me want to go back once more to the small town south of Dallas.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|A sign of a good book is that you never get tired of reading it, and I was never bored through this great 800 page masterpiece. Martin has earned the title of the American Tolkien.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book, I didn't believe there would be a story,<br />but after reading book two there definitely is a story, a sad story.  Book two<br />kept me more in suspense, as to his feelings for her and when he was going to<br />tell her the whole story about himself.<br />I'm looking forward to book three.<br /><br />Judy Steigleder

This is a must buy if you have the other DC Universe movies!

B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book is pretty decent. It has elements of popular psychology, applied psychology/ advertising, profit maximizing techniques, and organizational psychology.<br /><br />The author started off well, with the story of a man whose brain had been injured, and so he lost his long term memory. But he was still able to form habits. And that was enough to get him through a large part of life. Take away message: The part of your brain where you consciously learn things is not the same part as where you form habits. So far, so good. The Pepsodent and Febreze stories were also fairly believable. But then the book started to fall apart as Duhigg went into further stories. There was the story of the football coach. But it was not clear *what* habits were being changed. Ditto for the alcoholics who visited AA. Why did *some* of the alcoholics relapse and others come off the  bottle? It wasn't clearly explained in terms of habits. He does modulate back and forth several times in the chapter, and he adds the spooky element of \\"belief.\\" (If you change your habits, followed by believing in something, then good things will follow.) But didn't we already know that?<br /><br />I liked his demonstration of how willpower was depleted (the cookies and radishes experiment)--and it was here that the book modulated into a pop psychology text. He picked up a little more with Starbucks and the orthopedic patients. But on the other hand.......didn't we already know that having a plan of action ready for when something happens was/is a good idea? Was it really necessary to write a book/chapter to tell us that?<br /><br />There are elements of something that was detailed at length in Francis Fukuyama's [[ASIN:0684825252 Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of Prosperity]]: When you give people some autonomy in their job, that is what makes them happier. (And this seems to be true.)<br /><br />Duhigg starts out with individual habits, and then moves up to organizational habits. From there he goes one step further to the habits of society. It's a bit of a stretch to analogize individual habits into organizational habits and then a bit further into the habits that make a successful mass movement. But who can blame him for trying? (For what it is worth, the classic discussion of mass movements is Eric Hoffer's [[ASIN:0060505915 The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (Perennial Classics)]])<br /><br />Finally, he bookends the macro-scale discussion of habits with more micro-scale discussion of habits, but with a view to their ethical implications. Can someone be held accountable for murder if they do it in their sleep (since self defense is a habit)? If someone becomes habituated to gambling and loses all their money, are they responsible?<br /><br />Overall, the book has a veneer of plausibility but just seems.......stretched. I won't say that it's not worth reading, but it's not quite worth the Kindle price. And there are a lot of good stories here for future reference.he goes one step further to the habits of society.

1881273873|4.0|I've heard about this book for quite some time now, but after reading it I consider myself a better \\"lover\\". Not only was I able to analyze my own love language, I'm better equipped to love those around me and understand their love language as well. It really is amazing how differently we express and receive love. I strongly recommend this to anyone especially newly engaged couples.
B007ZD17XO|1.0|I have owned and played through both previous Montezuma games so I was really happy to get this new version with a twist on the same gameplay.<br /><br />BUT I literally have a love/hate relationship with version 3.  The lag makes this game completely unplayable.  the game will literally lock up for about 5-10 seconds two or three times per round while the clock continues to tick down from 60 seconds.  This not only destroys the fun and flew off the game but makes it impossible to move forward, instead just making it incredibly FRUSTRATING to play.<br /><br />I have done everything I can to play including rebooting, overclocking the CPU, overclocking the GPU, and rebooting.  Sometimes I can get a solid 10 minutes of play time before the lag sets in.  But most of the time it's nearly unplayable.<br /><br />I'm only up to the third vault and my highest score is about 580k points but there are times I can't even break 30k due to the ridiculous lag!

B0082A3HTQ|4.0|I really like this soundtrack. I think the music choices are excellent! However, I would like to have seen the names of the artists and other people involved with the recording. All I got was the CD with a picture cover and soundtrack title.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have literally not taken this CD out of my car CD player since I first got it a couple of months ago. Does Rush have better songs than the songs on Clockwork Angels? Yes, several. But as an overall effort, as a whole composition, as single piece of art encompassing all songs on the album, I think Clockwork Angels is their best album ever. There are elements that remind me of all of their eras - the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 00s - and I can hear bits of 2112, Caress of Steel, Permanent Waves, Power Windows, Counterparts, Presto, and Test for Echo in the various tracks.<br /><br />In addition, the story that is told in this concept album really hit home with me, and resonates deeply with some of my own life experiences. I cannot get enough of this album.
B008I34ZUM|3.0|This is the 3rd time it's been released on CD.  But seemingly all 3 CDs share the same (or very similar) digital master.  (Yeah, Cheepnis was remixed on some of the CDs.  Big whoop.  The remix isn't even as good as the original mix.)  So that's some double dipping going on.  I can deal with that.  What still bothers me, hence the 3 star rating, is that the original CD release was remastered from since when the lp was released.  Sorry, it's a LIVE recording.  What's with the faded out tracks?<br /><br />Why not do a proper 2 CD release with all the excised parts included?  I personally think fade outs on a LIVE recording are unforgivable.  But that's just me.  :-)

B000XVSU9O|5.0|This book is incredibly helpful and informative! As a person of Christian faith, I found it to be so very inspiring. I recommend it for anyone who has lost a lovee one, or who does nnot believe in God.
159420411X|2.0|I think this book is a good introduction for folks who do not have a background in statistics and probability and would like to read some anecdotal material about current prediction issues in sports, politics, gaming, etc. I felt several chapters wandered between generalization and detailed discussion (Kasparov, climate change).<br /><br />From the whole book I found the stories about baseball forecasting most interesting. Of course this is what Mr. Silver has passion about! Also the discussion about issues with Fisher vs. Bayesian statistics. I don't agree with the author about the negative implications of Fisher statistics. They are still valuable in confined systems (e.g. manufacturing processes).<br /><br />I did find the use of signal versus noise terminology interesting, but the book never takes a few moments to explain  some key ideas by Shannon and Wiener on signal and noise. This could be supplemented with some concrete examples of extracting a signal out of what looks to be a hopelessly noisy environment.<br /><br />I do rate the book very highly for professional thoroughness on footnotes and references. So many books today are written in a casual style that is more likely to cause skepticism. An appendix on summarizing typical human biases in forecasting would also be useful(e.g. recency bias, linearization bias, anchoring bias, extreme consequece bias, and many others).<br /><br />Risk = consequence of the occurence times the probability of occurence.

B00004T9VY|5.0|Very fine disc, for me more mature than \\"buddah....\\" Some tracks are exceptionally beautiful, like \\"sad lisa\\". Very finely crafted and sung, I recommend this cd indeed.
B0086449YA|5.0|This review is from: Privateering (Audio CD)<br />The Financial Times described Privateering as 'a fine set of songs about masculine struggle and salvation with an expert craftman's finish'. The Washington Post commented that Knopfler has created a 'subtly beautiful and diverse musical landscape', while The Daily Express found it 'lyrically sound and musically flawless'. But is it really that good?<br /><br />I suppose it depends just how varied your musical tastes are. Certainly much of this is very blues-influenced with over half of the twenty tracks leaning that way; the rest of the double CD follows more familiar paths that explore Celtic folk, rock and country - many of which need to be played loud and on a decent stereo for detailed listening.<br /><br />Whilst it's fair to say the extensive rock solos that punctuated the likes of 'Telegraph Road' and 'Sultans' will not be found here, nobody could accuse the guitarist here of simply going through the motions. The gritty, bluesy solos, which shape the likes of 'I Used To Could', 'Gator Blood', 'Hot or What' and 'Today is Okay', are a million miles away from the soporific Kill to Get Crimson and so much more fun as a result!<br /><br />But whilst the aforementioned tracks are more 'muscular' in their delivery, complete with the usual wry lyrics, Privateering isn't without some depth. Consider 'Two Yon Crows' where Knopfler sets the scene of the shepherd and his dog musing about life working in all winds and weathers. It's clear Knopfler shows compassion for real people doing a hard day's work without pontificating. (\\"All you bring to this is muscle and grit - persistence, that's just about it. What made you think there would be a living in sheep? Eat, work, eat, work and sleep.\\"). Whilst there's nothing romantic about this depiction of a rainswept heath (\\"Pennies from Heaven? Don't make me laugh!\\"), there's a wonderful irony where Knopfler sees optimism in the most unlikely of places: \\"I raise my flask to the clearing skies - you sweepers, you carrion spies - to scavenge and survive. If you can do it, so can I\\".<br /><br />Meg Reid commented in Oxford American that 'Knopfler maintains a writer's heart: an urge to tell the truest story about people with the most difficult and desperate lives and to preserve human desires whether in their ideal or most weakened states'. How about the departing lovers reminiscing about their affection for the rainy city ('Seattle') or the contemplation of mortality ('Dream of the Drowned Submariner')? Both offer opportunity to reflect and to re-evaluate our own lives but from different perspectives. Perhaps they do not quite make the hairs stand on end in the way that 'So Far From the Clyde' did in Get Lucky but the storytelling is as sharp as ever.<br /><br />Even after thirty-five years, this superb collection of varied songs goes to prove that Knopfler is still at the top of his game. Privateering is full of contrast, both lyrically and stylistically and is a great return to form. Little wonder that it has been so well received the world over...
B00753MBHA|5.0|To start off, I have been an ACCEPT Fan since their early days in the 1980's.  The guitar work to go along with UDO's vocals made this band very appealing to me.  I was ecstatic when I read in 2010 they were back in the studio with a new CD with a new vocalist.  Mark Tornillo is more than capable and is not a carbon copy of UDO.  Of course, as fans, we always want bands to continue with all original members intact, but that doesn't happen very often.  The first album with this lineup was \\"Blood of the Nations\\" and it was excellent.  Wolf Hoffman has always been one of my favorite guitarists, and his name is made for Metal Music.  On \\"Stalingrad\\", the band keeps up the same intensity they had with the previous album.  Songs such as \\"Hellfire\\" \\"Revolution\\" \\"Hung, drawn and quartered\\" harken back to days of \\"Neon Nights\\" \\"Princess of the Dawn\\".  I can say this is my favorite album to listen to and I am so happy that the band is experiencing a renewed popularity.  If you loved ACCEPT before, buy this.  If you've never listened to the older songs of the band, take a listen, and buy this CD.  It ranks with the current Metal Bands putting music out, probably surpassing them actually.  Thanks ACCEPT!

0525953728|5.0|Not much of a reader but this book is very good, I read Lone Survivor and I thought this book was a bit better. They are both GREAT books but this just sucks you into the book that you just cant put it down. I know this book has a lot of controversy, but I don't really see where the \\"classified\\" stuff is exposed that the media and movies haven't already put out.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|Excellent production values but no characters and plot holes bigger than black holes.<br /><br />Now Amazon is insisting I write at least 20 words. That's BS. My entire review was one line and that's all this movie warranted.<br /><br />Amazon--don't tell your customers how to write a review!

B003Y5H5BA|4.0|I'm too young to have seen the original 21 Jump Street on television, but I saw the first season on DVD way back in high school.  (What can I say?  I've been a Johnny Depp fan since Edward Scissorhands.)  I was excited for the new movie, and even went to see it in theaters as a birthday present to myself.  I saw it again this Sunday, with my sister, renting it from the local Redbox.<br /><br />And I still liked it!  The kids were asleep, we had fresh pumpkin brownies, and it was so nice to watch something that wasn't Spongebob Squarepants.  (Nickelodeon, why do you play the same episodes over and over again?)<br /><br />21 Jump Street is a pretty straightforward action-comedy.  Janko (Channing Tatum) and Schmitt (Jonah Hill) weren't friends in high school, but they became buds in the police academy.  Janko was good at the physical stuff; Schmitt at the mental.  Now, after a failed drug bust, they're back in high school trying to stop a drug ring from spreading.<br /><br />Not all of the humor is to my taste, but 21 Jump Street made me laugh a lot.  Tatum and Hill have great timing and chemistry.  In addition to pretty funny - and self-aware - dialogue, there are lots of physical gags.  Keep an eye out for the guys maneuvering around a couch in the climatic shoot-out.  Moving away from drama for comedy in the reboot was a good choice.<br /><br />I'm not so big on the romantic storyline.  Schmitt ends up having a bit of a thing with Molly (Brie Larson), although it's more flirting on the phone than anything physical.  It's still a grown guy hitting on an underage girl under false pretenses.  It's skeevy.  (Given less screen time is Ellie Kemper as a teacher with a crush on Tatum's character, which fortunately goes nowhere.)<br /><br />Basically, I'm glad they're making a sequel.  21 Jump Street is a fun movie and I'm ready to see the guys go to college.

B0087HT36U|4.0|This is a fun game, every level is passable & you don't need to buy anything (unless you really want to...).That being said, the solution May not always be immediately apparent, & you will find yourself replaying many levels to get a higher score - not a bad thing as almost all are fun & only a few are annoying. The design is simple while visually appealing, the sounds & Fx are minimalistic & just right. A good way to pass a bit of time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is awesome. I love that it has Bible plans and reminders to read them.  I love that you can highlight in different colors.  you also earn badges for completing certain things.  very easy to navigate and you must have Internet access to use this so I recommend having a e Bible in case you are traveling and want to read the Bible when there is no Internet.  that would be the only thing I would complain about but I have a niv bible e book so I'm good.  I almost forgot I love that there are so many versions of the Bible you can use.  you version has merged with Bible.com
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I actually had previously played all of thatgamecompany's titles, including Journey and purchased this for the absolutely stellar soundtracks. However, if you don't already own any of these games, Journey in particular, this is a great deal. Along with the game, there are the soundtracks, wallpapers and behind the scene videos.<br /><br />The game itself is one of the most moving, lovely and absolutely different games I have played in a very long time.
0674048849|5.0|I literally SWOONED when I saw this copy of Emma: An Annotated Edition edited by Bharat Tandon. I have cherished this annotated series of Jane Austen's novels by Harvard University Press, including the Annotated Pride and Prejudice and the Annotated Persuasion.<br /><br />Foremost, the books are lushly illustrated, beautifully produced, and well-researched by known Jane Austen scholars. Jane Austen Emma: An Annotated Edition is no exception. Considering the beautiful package, the book is very reasonably priced at $35 U.S. (reduced at Amazon), a perfect gift for the Janeite or historian in your family. Jane Austen Emma: Annotated Edition begins with a comprehensive introduction by Bharat Tandon, an academic, writer, and reviewer who has lectured at the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford and specializing in teaching British literature after 1700, and American literature after 1900.<br /><br />Emma is the only novel Jane Austen named after her heroine. Although she was fond of her eponymous character, she did not foresee Emma becoming a general favorite with the reading public, saying, 'I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.' Truth be told, I've never quite warmed up to Emma Woodhouse, but in relation to other novels my dislike is minor.<br /><br />Her father, Mr. Woodhouse, on the other hand, has completely won me over with his odd, endearing hypochondriac ways, encouraging Mrs. Bates to eat a soft boiled egg and a very little bit of apple-tart, and a small half glass of wine put into a tumbler of water. Later in the novel, Mr. Woodhouse engages in a discussion with Frank Churchill about the room at the Crown, in which Frank tries to reassure the older man that the room engaged for the ball will be so large that there would be no occasion to open the windows and let in cold air upon heated bodies. Mr. Woodhouse nearly goes apoplectic at the thought, for both men are convinced that sweaty bodies should not be exposed to fresh air, a concept wonderfully explained by Tandon in his annotation, which quotes The Code of Health and Longevity by John Sinclair (1807).<br /><br />\\"They were stopping,however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer Tandalls than Ford's; and had ll but knocked, when Emma caught their eye. - Immediately the crossed the road and came forward to her.\\" I was astonished to discover in this book that Jane Austen's use of 'catching an eye' was one of the earliest citations of that particular use of that phrase in the OED, which has cited Pride and Prejudice in the instance when Darcy catches Elizabeth's eye and withdrew his own.<br /><br />Tandon discusses the meaning of making an entrance, the etiquette of dinner seating, square pianos, the plight of governesses, and so forth. Annotated books are such treasures for the serious reader of Jane Austen's novels, explaining her words and old-fashioned idioms and making long dead customs come alive. This lushly illustrated annotation from Harvard University Press both instructs and entertains with its running commentary along the margins, enhancing our enjoyment of one of Jane Austen's most perfectly realized novels.<br /><br />This edition, cover and all, is absolutely beautiful. Five stars.pt wonderfully explained by Tandon in his annotation, which quotes The Code of Health and Longevity by John Sinclair (1807).<br /><br />\\"They were stopping,however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer Tandalls than Ford's; and had ll but knocked, when Emma caught their eye. - Immediately the crossed the road and came forward to her.\\" I was astonished to discover in this book that Jane Austen's use of 'catching an eye' was one of the earliest citations of that particular use of that phrase in the OED, which has cited Pride and Prejudice in the instance when Darcy catches Elizabeth's eye and withdrew his own.<br /><br />Tandon discusses the meaning of making an entrance, the etiquette of dinner seating, square pianos, the plight of governesses, and so forth.

B002QNGKGW|5.0|Perfect writing, perfect acting. Suspensful, everything was excellent about this season. Even my husband, who I've been trying to convince for years to watch this show with me said \\"Yeah, I heard Season 4 is pretty good.\\" Pretty good? Season 4 was EPIC!!!!!!!! I love Dexter.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert!!!*** My only complaint: I would not have killed off Trinity. I would have kept the door open for this awesome characters return to torment Dexter.
