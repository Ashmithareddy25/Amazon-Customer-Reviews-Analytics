B00726UHDK|5|It says it all! This shirt gets the point across. So funny and we can't wait till football season is here.
B00410Z91A|4|Works as described
B006QOGKF8|1|Also, I don't like the Alki I name sewn into the hat.  I just wanted a plain black hat!
B003D83S5A|5|Fast shipping, good quality.
B00IJCBETW|3|I wished for different material..But looks like jersey dress...But looks pretty when you wear.
B008DPZNLK|3|It fits good, but the wire in the middle of the cup is uncomfortable and unflattering.
B001HBT2X2|2|Beautiful colors. But smelled terrible. After washing 3 times, they still smelled terrible.  Hello garbage. Would not recommend this product to anyone.
B00LUK4S3E|1|Very small
B00G6I95SI|4|I love the feel and the look of this outfit.  It's really one of the softest outfits my baby has - I love it.<br />There are 2 minor cons to this cute little ditty: 1) It runs a bit small/short.  My almost 4 month old (in the 90th percentile) is on the verge of growing out of the 3-6 month size.  2) The collar/neck hole is huge.  I have to put a onesie on my baby otherwise her neck and chest would be pretty exposed on the front and back.  (I took a pic and will try to upload)
B0077254O6|4|Purchased this set for my four year old step son.  He loves wearing them, has only ever complained about an itchy tag but what child hasn't?  I would recommend this product.
B00BCUPK0C|5|Nice Jean for women.  Very comfortable
B00C8FLNDI|5|Great fit... Wonderful gift to my sister
B00SIP8RT0|5|The shorts were big around the waist. So I washed and dried them twice and Im in lovveeeeee
B002NUZ2Z8|4|I could have gotten a similar, albeit thinner peacoat for about a quarter of the price, but my wife likes it, so I'm happy.
B001CK3PWM|5|they went perfect with my costume and came in just in time for my halloween costume. they did a great job and was exaclty what i asked for
B000VK7YXK|3|This bra just doesn't seem to fit as well as the Bali. It also digs into my left side. I've had other glamorize bras and totally loved them. This one not so much.
B00BUAC26O|4|It fits fine love the color thanxs
B000NZW3IY|1|Okay, so...I read a lot of the reviews here, and was really interested in getting in on some of the lady-action the other reviewers described.  So when my shirt showed up, I was positively trembling with anticipation by the time I put it on.     It worked...Sort of.  I mean, yeah...it attracted women, all right.  But they were all sort of stocky, and most of them had mullets and flannel shirts on.  At first, I figured this was no big deal.  I'm not usually attracted to women who don't wear eye makeup, but hey.  Beggars can't be choosers.      At least so far this was in keeping with what a lot of the other reviewers had to say.  But when I tried to put the patented, never-fail moves on 'em, I got completely rejected.  A lot of 'em seemed into it at first, but at the moment of truth, I got shoved away.  And I'm sorry...But if some chick is gonna go to all the trouble of taking my pants off for me, it's not exactly considered the nicest thing in the world to stop once she sees how \\"excited\\" I am.  And it's even LESS nice to attempt to kick me in the places that have barely begun to come out and breathe besides.    I have no idea what their problem was, but they all had the same one.  What kind of chick acts like she's all into it, but then won't even touch you once you cross the point of no return? I even offered to leave the shirt on.  Well, I USUALLY like to do it with a shirt on anyway.  I'm sorta self-conscious about my man-boobs, but that's why I was glad the shirt was black in the first place.      Whatever.
B008BMY6R2|5|Fit is amazing, the shape is very flattering and the fabric is super comfortable. I will probably order more of these.
B00VOUZGSG|5|Arrived very quickly, exactly as advertised!
B00K0LA3VA|2|If you're thinking these are dressy as they show in the picture, they're not. They're basically grey khakis. With that said, they're nice pants, I was just expecting something dressier looking from the item photo in this listing and that's not what these are.
B00065Q9CW|3|I am what you might call a 'fashion conquistador'. I view the world of fashion as a hostile territory to be conquered and exploited as I see fit and proper. Thusly, I am known in some circles as a trend-setter, and I routinely find myself having to flee from crowds of style-hungry mobs who want to emulate my essence of flair and sass. <br /> <br />In my expert opinion, the two things that are missing from high-class outerwear these days are drama and Eurasian dash. That is why I am so pleased to inform you, the less-than-fashionable coat buyer, that this particular coat is just what the world of couture is so desperately hungery for.  <br /> <br />Now, I know what you must be thinking at this point: \\"Murray, you're a man's man; why on earth would you be so giddy over what is quite obviously a coat designed for women?\\" well, my inquisitive follower of fashion, that is what makes this garment so unique for the male wearer. When purchased in a size that adequately cloaks the wearer's girth and stature (both of which I possess in abundance), one can hardly discern that this is a woman's coat at all! Just gaze upon the thing: it obviously has that distinctive asexual look that is the true mark of all superior apparel items. <br /> <br />If I had to name one drawback regarding my new coat, it would be the price. Although six-hundred-thousand dollars is really not a lot of money for an item of this quality, I am feeling the effects of liquidating most of my investments in order to fund its purchase. However, perhaps my newfound pauperdom can be effectively offset by the realization that when I am wearing this dramatic coat, I FEEL like approximately one million dollars(US). <br /> <br />Please buy this garment. Support drama and Russia in modern fashion!
B0038ZNLUA|4|The top of the dress is great but the skirt was waaaaay too long! I had to cut about 10 inches off and this was quite a task because the skirt is flared! It turned out okay though and everyone thought it was cute!
B00J5S7THK|5|My favorite shirt
B00BBLAF20|5|Just what i needed for my hook costume.  Fits well and looks amazing.  If you are doing a pirate with a lot of hair this is the way to go.
B00OHE8G8S|3|Average size is 10? A size 10 can fit onto my thumb
B00KOJG0B0|4|HAve had Woolrich products before and usually the large is fine, but it's tighter than I had expected.  It works as an open shirt over a turtleneck .  But not what I had expected.
B002RAIOWM|5|I took my measurements as recommended to verify proper sizing before ordering, and it fit perfectly!  It was comfortable and supportive for high impact workouts like running and kickboxing aerobics.  This vendor had the product to me in a matter of a couple days after ordering which was a great surprise. I plan to order more!
B004LUGDY2|5|My brother-in-law, a fisherman by hobby, loved this shirt. The graphics are crisp and the shirt is a good quality.
B007IUV8JW|5|Loved this belt, especially because it fit!
B009LQCV4W|5|The Thirsty Towels Turkish Cotton Luxury Bathrobe for Men and Women were so great I bought one for my daughter and one for her  husband...she called me after receiving them as gifts an said that she and her husband loved them...the felt so good that they thought they were staying in a sweet at the Ritz...After that call, I bought on for myself...I also need to stay in the Ritz...I also bought them and myself the 40&#34; x 80&#34; Bath Sheet of the same weight material...wow...I now have turn my shabby Home into an apartment into one at the Ritz...now where is room service...
B003YJBYPE|4|These socks fit so well, and they are beyond comfortable, the price is a little high but you cant find good quality socks in the stores here
B00NU5Y68E|5|AWESOME Track Jacket!!! Fits as expected.
B00EZQ4KYW|5|Good
B00CJSYW4G|3|The dress is beatiful and fits my girl very well.  The sizes must run a little small since she is 8 years old and I thought size 12 would be a little big but fits perfect.<br />The only negative issue is the glitter which is now distributed all over my home not so much fun in carpets and sofas etc.
B00EFGI37M|5|Absolutely loved the quality and price of the silk robe and pajama set. Truly classic and timeless pieces! Would definitely recommend.
B00GKC9X0A|1|Fits too small, returned.
B005OHCMO6|5|Supersoft is not an exaggeration.  I love the feel and fit of these French cut briefs. Will definitely buy them again.
B00BURVA3I|5|Just awesome. Thanks!
B00HQL7ZE0|5|excellent t-shirt, great quality and well constructed<br />I would love to buy more in the future
B00L0H9VB6|1|Product is horrible. It's not the same material as advertised, not the same style. I honestly believe that this person just grabbed a picture off the Internet to sell what they didn't want
B00KB49UG0|5|works great also for holding a hernia in
B00ZI3HU2K|5|Very beautiful. I like it.
B00FMO4XGG|4|Good purchase will do it again.
B00CF7MITC|4|Item arrived as expected.  Looks great, sending to my son in Germany.. Hope it washes well.
B00H7TE4ZE|5|I absolutely love this dress! Gorgeous, and the fabric is wonderful.
B00KJDO78E|5|So dang cute! The fabric is soft and the fit is just as expected.
B001PO5JE2|4|I love it! Fits great the pictures on line were spot on to what I got. As most of the other reverse said I will be trimming a bit off around the eyes and nose areas just for comfort the edges of the mask are a little irritating. I may even use this mask to make my helmet for future cosplay events.
B004C51NHS|5|I bought this wallet for my husband's birthday when it was listed on Fab.com<br />He constantly gets complimented on it everywhere we go. He said it's the perfect size and he loves it!<br />It held everything he had in a \\"normal\\" wallet, but he's not a hoarder. He's had it about a year now and it's holding up great.<br />I highly recommend Ogon above other metal wallets. Quality product!
B00IPN543C|3|The camo ones are a less stretchy material so the thighs are really tight
B00ID28446|5|I love this dress the color and the model
B00WODI6P2|5|My granddaughter absolutely loves it and can't wait for cooler weather to wear it!
B00JKQR9G8|4|Soft but smaller than normal LARGE.<br />Can wear it but would have preferred it less form fitting!
B00L2WUD98|2|VERY pretty, I love the colors and the material is soft and thin, great for really hot weather.  HOWEVER, the body of the dress was VERY tight fitting.  I had ordered a 6, I typically wear a 6, sometimes a 4 but it was way too small, it was beyond form fitting, it looked like I was wearing something two sizes too small.  The photo shows a loose, flowing body but that was not the case.  I returned it and ordered an 8 but the only difference was the bust was bigger, the body was just as small.<br />Seller was great, shipping was on time - actually earlier than expected.
B00KLFQXMI|4|Comfortable way to announce one's show.
B00F10SDS0|4|Good.
B00I13GUJI|3|the fabric is very strange but so soft. The fit is not skin tight, it's pretty loose actually. The screen printing is well done. My only real complaint is that the shirt isnt a true black, it's got that strange brown/red tint to it.
B00FXLJRB4|4|Very cute
B00EPODVLW|4|I wanted a simple, basic slipper that wouldn't make my feet sweat. These looked like the type of slipper that you get in a hotel room, and that's what I wanted.  I am not disappointed.
B00VOTSA4O|5|It fits really well!
B0058C4SGC|5|I ordered this jacket in Hot Cocoa and the color is great. Double opening zippers are good quality. The only problem is zippers on outer pockets which are not wide enough. But I like it very much. It is warm and nice, material - high quality. I usually wear pullovers in size M (even L), so I ordered this jacket in size M, and I am happy because it fits well.
B008AHJ2P4|5|These shorts fit me perfectly. They look good too. I recommend these if you're looking for quality shorts for a good price.
B00AB6GHHS|5|My Grandson loved the hat and gloves. He thinks he is batman so this was right on time. He lives in Denver so gloves and hat is really need it.
B00CW7QPK8|2|Didn't like the material (sheer in some places and itchy). True to size. Pretty much got what we paid for - we decided to return it.
B00AF3X3U6|5|This review applies to the Levis's 512 jeans in all 3 colors. At the deeply discounted price, they are a &#34;must.&#34; At the regular retail price, I would not buy them. Compared to my favorite Gloria Vanderbilt Amanda jeans, the Levi's run just a little smaller, and I went up a size. The fit is slightly loose, but better than being too tight. These jeans are very well made of high quality stretch fabric, with strong double needle stitching and a rugged zipper. The tone-on-tone patterns are sophistated and tasteful. A white top is all you need to make a smart outfit that could go anywhere. The Splatter Texture is a stylized camouflage or animal print in gray tones. It comes to life with a bright top in a warm/hot color, such as red, orange, or yellow. This is a nice departure from the usual black, white, and blue jeans that most of us live in.
B0015PC192|4|nice
B00422MCVW|4|have had the wallet for 6-8 months and the card sections are becoming loose so my cards don't stay in perfectly but other than that the wallet is appealing to the eyes and a decent price
B00B7QQVX6|2|The snap on the suspenders broke the first time my duaghter wore them, we fixed them but still you get what you pay for.
B00C18MCAK|3|This dress looks like it's made of rayon but it's not :(  Still a nice dress tho, stretchy but a tad see through.
B00DULVEXS|1|These pants are terrible. They shrank inches after I washed them.
B00CLVHTNC|5|My mentora loves it and is wearing it for prayer all the time !!
B00K8T4LZS|5|This is an adorable suit and worked well. The price was also right for a snowsuit which my son wore once. We don't live in the snowiest of climates but I wanted to have one on hand just in case we got a large snow and we could take our infant out to experience the snow. It kept him warm and dry, which is exactly what it is supposed to do.<br /><br />We love the suit and can't wait for the next baby to maybe wear it!
B00AOUVWSK|5|The mask is made very well. It is made of a thicker rubber and the paint really pops. it is a lot better than most Bane masks I have seen. I wore it to momocon this past weekend and everyone wanted a picture with. I would recommend this product.<br /><br />[...]
B00J1LW5ZC|5|The most realistic head piece for dressing as malificent.  Would suggest wig cap if you have a lot of hair. But it looks pretty cool. Shipping was pretty quick as well.
B004JM1B7G|3|Okay so I know I shouldn't have washed it, my bad, but let me be the example of what not to do, like one of the other comments it indeed does pull the elastic from the lace, but again my bad. I shouldn't really even give this 3 stars because it's my fault, but that is can get ruined I suppose. I love this brand, I have several other shirts, and one of them the beads also were pulled off in the wash, also my bad. So my lesson learned is don't wash these clothes unless you and wash (so never...) I'm actually buying another one because I liked it so much and I'm not gonna wash it, I sewed the beads back on the other shirt. And I'm normally a large, I'm 180lbs 5'1&#34;, so I got the x-large and fits just right for me, the first thing I bought from this company I bought 2 sizes too big because of all the reviews but was a little too big, so for me one size up is fine.
B00B9UG1MQ|1|I do not recommend purchasing this dress.  The overall quality of this dress is quite poor.  From the zipper, to the chosen fabric, to the stitched on patches (which make up the pattern on the dress)--every aspect and detail of this dress looks very cheaply done (especially up close and in person).<br />Every time I have tried on this dress the zipper has gotten stuck in several different spots.  Secondly, the quality of the fabric looks and feels of very poor quality.  The fabric is incredibly sheer and is a dark, dingy yellow-tinged cream color.  Lastly, the stitched on bits of patterned design look and feel poorly designed and fixed onto the dress.  This dress looks (and feels) more like a (well-worn) thrift store find than a quality, French Connection piece.<br />Looking at the dress online, I mistakenly believed it would make for a very simple, yet pretty wedding dress but the quality of this dress is too poor to even be worn as a casual warm-weather dress.<br />I cannot speak to actual fit of the dress because I purposely purchased the dress several sizes too large so that alternations could be made for a perfect fit.  However, if you are new to the French Connection line, please note that it usually runs at least one size smaller than other brands.
B003XKVM8S|5|It arrived quickly. Looks just like it does in the picture. Fits him well and he loves it! For the Horde!!
B001T8W5KK|4|Great find for school uniform!
B00BZ6I5Z0|4|It was a bit too &#34;flufffy&#34;-looking for me. I exchanged it for the 1 tier just like it and it was beautiful. Customer service was awesome and I received the refund and new item very quickly.
B00FQE3XG8|5|These are great!  You don't want to see my body on the beach.  They fit great and work great.  Would buy again!
B00BWJ2ZUQ|4|You do not feel stuffed into sausage casing in these; they are light, cool, and comfortable.  The support is just enough so that you don't feel like you're completely jiggling in the wind.  The material is sleek, allowing clothing to slide smoothly right over it as you move.<br /><br />My one negative is the waistband...it feels great, lays smoothly when standing up, but when seated, it cuts in.  This is okay when wearing a skirt, but not a sundress.
B00SZD7MM8|5|These r great
B00DGAGGPO|4|Collar's a little stiff but that should wear off.
B000UFNIAY|4|Came very quickly. Not quite as colorful as some other patches, but it is really cute and people who like Alice will like it!
B00IJJPIQA|5|I like it very much!<br />Would order it again!
B003ZZUVMO|5|How can you go wrong with a slider tee?
B00Q6KVTDA|5|Very cute top I wanted to wear as a dress or with leggings so I ordered it large for a 25lb 16 month old. It fits her fine, a bit loose in the top and just below mid thigh so with some bloomers it works well and will fit for a while with leggings later.  Love this brand very much for the colour!
B007TJFOWE|1|the second i took this out of the box it looked odd.  sleeves were four to five inches shorter than any of my hubbys other jackets that are the same size.  this must have been an irregular/defective jacket.  horrible fit way tooooooo big and short and awkward. And the best part is we are really busy during the season and i forgot to return it. i thought i had a 90 day window but guess not.  Now I'm stuck with IT.  PAID 90.00  what a rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00I16MCYW|5|Hat is a big (my daughter is 2 months), but that hopefully means we'll get some use before she grows out of it. I love that it has a cinch around the head so we can adjust as she grows!
B00E3MJWVO|5|So I didn't have that much expectations when I purchased this blazer.  I actually thought it was going to run small.  But I received it today and it fits just right.  Actually, I think it's a wee bit loose, but nothing major.  I'm 6ft, size 10 and I ordered a Large.
B008L1WVQG|5|Exelente
B003PXA7VQ|4|Good quality and the shorts hang down to the knees like I like them to. Would recommend.
B004S6NWJI|5|Built very well, they fit as if they were 300.00 shoes! Amazing for the price, and overall i'm 100% satisfied . The care in which they were packaged and sent was very professional also.
B0093KTFTK|3|It was too small, but I easily fixed it by buying a longer ribbon to thread through the wholes in the back.
B00EKOAD72|5|Super soft tee - a winner!
B00806POFC|5|Quality of hat is very nice and the patchs are made great too, nice touches to details and workmanship too.
B00KV3M766|5|Amazing mask, crazy fast shipping. I couldn't have been happier. This seller rocks!
B00BCYDRNK|3|I am a little disappointed at the size of this outfit, it looks like it will be way too big (for our now 10 month old 18.5 pound girl).... But we are still hoping it will be ok by the time she turns 1 in May....
B00REIO7OQ|5|so cute
B00GJMT1FS|3|The material of the dress is nice and drapes the body well.  I ordered a medium instead of a large because of other comments I read and I am glad I did.  The medium it fits just fine.  The blue is a little intense, it is as if the dress overwhelms me, but maybe that is because I am short  (5'3&#34;).  I am going to keep it and try it with a sweater, belt or scarf or combination thereof.
B002EQJYP0|5|Well made and very flattering. I recieved so many compliments on this, I just had to buy another one in a different color.
B0089BYR7O|3|These will work for a couple-few outfits but they're not built to last.  Sizing was spot on, purchased a size 6 to 8 for a size 8 ( normally find 8 to 10).  They look awesome.
B002ZAPJWC|1|YOU SENT ME 2 LEFT HAND GLOVES !!!!!!!<br />  I AM FORTUNATE TO HAVE BOTH MY HANDS....<br />IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO USE MY PURCHASE IF YOU DID SOME QUALITY CONTROL BEFORE SENDING OUT ORDER.
B00DMZFPPA|4|I received this in a Large, US Medium and they fit me snugly; I'm 6ft tall, 190lbs with a 42&#34; chest.  It definitely hugs the chest and arms, but that was my intention.  I just can't gain any weight.<br /><br />Love the color, like the style, but the material leaves something to be desired.  This is a good shirt to wear out, but I can't imagine it for pajama style comfort and lounging.
B00MVHWDIC|5|After reading all the reviews I knew to order a size up. Go exactly by the sizing chart! Love this thing! Cant wait to see what my waist looks like after a month
B005OLBYPU|2|Way to small. I wear an extra large and that size usually fits me loose. These shirts were at least a full size too small. Usually buy the Nautica shirts but no one had my size. In the future I will wait for the Nautica shirts. I feel like I wasted my $35 bucks.
B00B098RKU|5|I was amazed at the quality of these bowties.  The price is right, but don't let that fool you.  They are very substantial and well crafted.  I've received many compliments when wearing these ties.
B001CFD0L8|5|Quality shirt
B003JOVVSY|5|Bought this as a gift for my best friend who has a one-year old daughter and they just love it. I saw it on a website and searched all over with little results, relieved to find it here. Highly recommend!
B00E6T84A4|1|The Print In The Picture Looks Clear. When They Arrived The Print Was Extremely Blurry. It Was a Bummer They Looked So Cool...
B002AQRYA6|5|The size is right on and ironing is not required provided you take them right out of the dryer as soon as they're done and hang them up.  Expandable waist is awesome.
B00K2JI790|3|Too small, i can't wear them.  I'm sad cause I really liked them.
B009W7B26S|5|I've used this saying a million times to my SO in reference to SO's inability to have grown above 66 inches of height. Although my SO (henceforth referred to as SO) is a physically fit and healthy specimen, SO is still a prime target for teasing from the author who is clearly above 66 inches of height. During the initial stages of courtship (please don't draw attention to this review, the recipient SO uses this account to write reviews, buy stuff, etc. and will try to give you a spin on the story [this is a no-spin story, by the way]), SO was not amused by my clear references to SO's height. So, SO used to get mad [I contend that this was purely for my attention and this is a historical fact and any attempts by SO to alter this review is deemed propaganda] until I told SO it's not a big deal to no avail until one day SO embraced being fun sized. I noticed this, and many moons later (coincidentally) saw this shirt and purchased it to SO's delight.
B0012C5LF4|5|I have been extremely happy with this purchase.  It has held up well through many washes, and gives great support without the irritation that I have had with many other bras.
B00HAV6T3Y|5|Ive always wanted a skater skirt, i thought they were just so cute, especially on a short girl like me. i absolutely love this skirt. perfect for spring and summer.
B00OFLPY1A|1|Mad
B00OOA64DO|5|Perfect!
B00LB9G8LY|2|Keeps slipping off my feet - i wear shoe size 6.5. I have worn one pair - is there a way to return other 3 unused pairs?      2/23/2015 Im updating my review. If there was separate section for customer service this product would have got 5 on 5. I was contacted by the company for feedback, upon hearing it doesnt fit well they refunded the whole amount. They also suggested i try a smaller pair that would be releasing soon. Thanks for reaching out. It really shows your commitment in making your product better and comfortable for everyone.      However i am still leaving 2 star for the actual product as it is big for me. I will update it if their smaller socks (which is to yet to be sold in market) fits me well.
B009914BVA|5|Great socks for yoga or Pilates
B001XON4E6|5|Fantastic,, May not make the hat the size you want the first time...that's OK its very durable, and will last and last:-)
B008G7JOBA|5|Other than the sizing that is bigger than the usual (as is Carhartt tradition), the jacket is just what I wanted. It is medium/heavy warmth, coated with durable sandstone duck, and well constructed. I'm looking forward to wearing this in more, and the sherpa isn't itchy (in case you were wondering). I'll update this review over time with anything major that changes, but for now this is another great Carhartt!
B00GQO0GEO|5|My daughter and i like to take turns wearing these socks.  They are soft and comfy.  They wash ok.  The seller shipped these very quickly too.  Thank you.
B00B5UDV1E|1|too small for DD cup
B008SEBR2U|5|Great
B00CJ00XH4|1|The dress is nothing like what it looks like in the picture. It is not true to size either based on size chart. I got the snake skin one. It was too short and above my knees and I am 5 7&#34;. The material is poor quality as well. Further more it was supposed to be long sleeves and the sleeves are reaching my elbows. I definitely regret buying it!
B0031U0QBO|4|These have worked really well and seem to be good quality. We did try a pair of camo carharrt suspenders as well and they material was silky feeling which caused the adjusters to slide and not lock in place. The material on theses seems to have more texture and the locks to slide at all. They fit well and keep him from having to pull his jeans up constantly all day.
B001EMDQI6|5|I throw this on the uniform when I want to be a little nerdy.  It looks good and is well made.
B00BB8VT8M|5|I found the outfilt to be a good value and met my expectations for the designer name.I would suggest it for anyone!
B00IR70SH8|5|LOVE
B00PKL8QOQ|4|Way to small for my head
B00KRYPVZS|3|its actually a 75/25 blend per the the label not 80/20 as advertised. It did shrink a full size when I threw it in the dryer not realizing it requires a low heat seating for drying : 
B003376NAS|5|Very nice. Flexible and has many compartments. Recommend for those who carry too much
B00DY5R9JI|5|Fit the little preemie who is just under 5 #.
B003VZHEOG|5|I would normally not write a review for &#34;granny panties&#34; however, I had to order these after I had a c-section and couldn't find any underwear that would properly go above my incision Cue these sweet, sweet briefs and you get one life-saving product and one grateful new momma. Seriously, I wore these for two months and I ordered them in XL since I didn't want anything rubbing on the incision. I packed them away for the next baby. Best postpartum purchase to date.
B00C0Q2ICK|5|Leather is very supple.  Take note the the hue is slightly lighter than pictured.
B00N9J63LO|4|Good pj set. Bought it for my 6 year old. She calls them her hot pajamas... and not heat hot... like sassy hot. Lol needless to say she loves them. Haven't washed them yet so we will see how they hold up.
B004OTQHXM|5|Good
B00AW47OIA|5|I got this as a gift for my mother-in-law. She loves burgundy, and this was such a beautiful saturation of it, and she loves it so much! The only weird thing about it is it smells really bad when you get it out of the package, so I suggest washing it to get the weird odor out.
B00GSNHM5O|5|Got this in the wine color and I got the complimentary necklace! I love it - I'm worried about it shrinking when I wash it but if I put it on the cold cycle it should be okay. It's soft!
B00EEI80F6|5|Just because my girl friend doesnt want me to wear this color. Recommended<br />The price is good too. you will love it
B0089N5MNU|5|Son loves it
B006333A8C|5|Gift to sis and she loved it.  Comfy and washes well, where her comments
B004SWJ6PQ|5|These pants fit and look great, which can be very difficult to come by with my body shape.  They are a little long, but that's ok as I hate it when I try to wear some of my shoes with a little heel and the pants just look too short.  I am 5'8&#34; so if you're too much shorter than me definitely think about buying a short pair.  I would definitely recommend these pants to anyone!
B009XEEMQC|5|It is Excellent, I received on time and the quality is great work as It’s required and I will give 5 stars, it’s just Wonderful, better impossible, I was checking many different and similar of this one and I couldn’t find someone like this.
B00IDZ8ERA|5|I must say I am really impressed it looks just like the picture. The shirt fits well it will definitely be a showstopper. My son wears 3t and it fits like it's tailored. By the way when I got the shirt it said 2/3 but it fits like a 3t.
B00LGCY5UW|5|My fav underwear
B00IQIX0Q4|5|Super cute, just like pic. However, the 6 is more like 7-8.
B004B8C2CQ|3|Very thin, but it looks good.  It isn't as weather protective as I thought, comparing it with a shemagh I got from Jordan.
B00AA02MBU|5|The size is true. The quality was very good looks like a much more expensive belt. The metal part is very good quality.
B00DMW6C0A|5|Best maternity purchase by far. Wish I had thought to get them sooner. Comfortable and perfect under dresses, skirts and blouses that have no belly support.
B001QGH118|2|I bought this for my Mom who is attending a Great Gatsby wedding theme. She indicated that the picture looks dark brown, but the wig is actually Black, black with no highlights. I did not order the Blonde wig was trying to order the flapper headband so was surprised when it was delivered. Mom disliked this even more indicating that it looked more like material than hair.  I didn't have high expectations given the price, but it didn't even pass muster as a costume.
B004ZGBZZO|4|Super cute!
B0000AIXZ6|2|The costume I received was not the one that is shown in the picture. It was a Scooby-Doo costume, but it was different; the quality of it was not as good and the head was weird. Anyway, the delivering and everything else was good.
B008J3DVP6|4|Difficult to find in my size at department stores.  Suggest ordering one size down unless you like it a bit snug. Perfect for me.
B00HN27WP4|5|The picture doesn't do this outfit justice it's even cuter when it's in front of you. It's adorable
B00B8QN9T4|5|I saw this dress on the eloquii website and didn't want to pay $90 for such a simple dress. I finally saw it on amazon for half price. This dress fits beautifully and really accentuates an hourglass shape. The material is a bit on the thin side but the dress is well made.
B00HK1J7RY|5|LOVE IT!
B00KQON6TM|4|Love the material and fit
B007FMC8I8|5|this is a really sexy costume and i would love to be it for halloween. much better costume than the ones ive seen in stores
B0040YODLO|3|Very itchy!
B0119J92P4|1|these pants order were a 2x, these pants are not a 2x.. These items are not true to size.. 2x looks more like a mens medium.
B006I9HMMQ|4|Material is okay. Great shirt for Billy Madison lovers - and apparently I need to fill eleven more words to complete this review. Done
B000P55140|5|Great
B00ODC64SS|1|Cheap quality, returned.
B007DJ31Y8|5|Perfect fit! Just as advertised... Nice to see someone still has a good Skynyrd shirt. I'll review after a few washes
B00LIUTQ42|5|Such a snappy sharp dress, flattering, well made & super great fabric!
B00BBRYCKU|5|Very sturdy and soft, and the fit is excellent. Perfect!
B00KNYT6G2|1|I ordered a size L (10-12) I bought it as a Easter gift for my daughter I took shirt out of package it look like a toddler shirt, I was very disappointed!!!!
B00JZWFRRA|4|Great glasses love them as a backup, but they are a little small for my big head.  but love that they are polarized and camo.
B004S0KTTK|5|This coat fits well and looks very sharp. I love the interior zip up section. It's hard to write a review on a coat during July.
B001M08U68|5|This was a gift for a friend and he loved it! The size was a bit larger but after washing will be perfect - delivered on time and as expected. I am very satisfied with the order.
B00008ID1O|5|I've been buying and wearing Jockey Elance Bikini for 25 years and have never been disappointed in the quality or comfort.  I just purchased 3 more packages of this product. I found NO chemical \\"baby powder\\" odor in these briefs.  The cotton fabric and construction remains of high quality.  Hopefully, the problem other reviewers in years past have complained about has been resolved by the manufacturer.  It certainly has never been my experience with Jockey Elance.
B007IDMXG6|5|6'1&#34; and an athletic 180.  I normally wear medium but went with the large and it fits perfectly.  Not too tight, instead it is well fitted.
B00MH6OD0S|5|Nice and fitted one
B00009P8BP|5|I bought the black pair first, after the first day of wearing them I went back and bought the brown pair. I get tons of compliments and they don't hurt your feet. You can wear them all day long. And they are the perfect height to be sexy and classy ... the perfect boot for me at work and play ... all with an awesome price tag.
B00IU06WTU|1|Too short and flimsy. Don't purchase, I sent them back as soon as I opened them.
B00FN67LRQ|4|Hangs loose, and isn't flattering on my chest.  Might as well have worn a men's shirt for how loose it is from the neck down!  Cute design, and got some laughs on Halloween, but not worth the price for being uncomfortable and seasonal.
B00MRMQMAQ|5|love
B00EHX2DHY|5|I am a woman and I like to sleep in loose fitting pants in the winter time. These did not disappoint  and I enjoy the softness. The pj pants have enough form that you can wear them around the house and not feel sloppy.  Cute designs
B00DTQETSG|5|Item is very nice. EU level. Not a Chinese junk.<br />Size is correct.<br />sewing lines is good inside and outside and overall is good looking. Store granted 10USD discount coupon to me too. Thank you.
B00CPPYCXY|4|good belt
B008UDUK22|5|This top is very cute in the blue/aqua tie dye. Perfect for my yoga and workouts, but even stylish enough to wear casually with jeans. Will probably buy more in other colors. It did take about a week to receive.
B00N3WW4DI|5|Beautiful dress -- and so comfortable!  I love the scarf accessory.  It has held up well to several washes so far.
B00NQF5JNY|5|This dress is perfect! Not only is it very well made, it is also very flattering. It makes me look much sexier than I actually am! Ha. But really, I would definitely recommend to a friend.
B00KIZEVIE|5|Fits perfect. Love it!
B005NRN75K|4|High quality wallet, suggested by a fellow vacationer, great for cards and tickets.
B00M7FQJ4M|5|These socks are great. They fit well and are made well also. They are not too thin and not too thick. Perfect socks for boots.
B00G1WULTQ|5|Bought for grandson as a gift & he loved it.
B003YZY5OU|3|Hankies are a nice color, and have a nice feel but are not really symmetrical. Not an issue functionally, but kind of weird when trying to fold.
B008KGLGT0|4|was to small the sleeves well my arms are kind of chunky i send back wow great the next day had refund and ordered same coat in bigger size fits great!!!!!!!!!! Ordered now for winter never to early to order!!!!!!
B0026P45VW|2|not sure what difference is with this bra and ones I buy in store---but same style number fit when bought from store & way too small with this one
B00RMTLMJK|5|Wonderful quality. Beautiful color. I am 5'0 and wear a 26 jean or size 2-4. I ordered a small and I love the fit. I've ordered some mediums in these neoprene suits, but thought I would try a small and I prefer this fit. Favorite swimsuit!
B000VK3XJE|5|Very comfortable!
B00245E0IM|5|My husband wore these for our tropical trip. Loved the pockets (he is a cargo pants-only guy), didn't look like scrubs. Comfortable and sexy!
B0058NZ66M|1|I ordered a dozen of these shirts (in various sizes) for a girls soccer team as part of an 80's theme costume we were doing for a Halloween tournament. The color is definitely not a true neon. Very faded and a few even had holes in them. Disappointed in the quality and color left much to be desired.
B001H9NDAC|1|Ordered these jammies for a Christmas present.  Package was labeled correctly, but the pajamas themselves were two sizes smaller than packing.  That can happen, but I ended up paying shipping BOTH ways.  THAT was unfair.  The company I purchased from should have paid the return shipping since it was their error.
B00AEO1KD8|4|Comfortable socks with a good fit. They seem a little thin and wear out over time, but I am pleased overall.
B00IKJGJYO|5|The belt is attractive, fits my husband, and he likes it. Good recommendation, I think.
B007IEGK96|5|Love the costume.  It arrived quickly.  My son loved it.  Be sure to look at the size chart for height when ordering it and be aware that it fits like second skin.
B00HIKUN6Q|4|Beautiful baptism outfit. The material isn't particularly soft and it would have been nice if the shirt was a onesie so it would stay tucked in, but it was worth it. My 4 month old looked very handsome.
B00OVPANJI|2|was not flattering
B00IRH9OBO|5|Super cute!
B0051HFI9K|3|The material is very rough. Not uncomfortably rough, but rough just the same. Not what I expected at all. I'll wear them, but won't buy any more.
B002HRL8KU|5|Good quality silk/weave and the silver color is stunning. The shawl is generously sized. Delivery was super fast. Would also make a very nice gift.
B00EPYCMB2|4|Good quality and design. In my case I bought a 32x30 but fits more like a 33x30, I dont know why I have bought same size, brand and style pants before and fitted better.
B00N23VW0Y|3|feels a little cheap for the price but my friend loved it
B009VZI110|1|These shorts were too small, the waist was not in the right place, and they came without tags, as if they had been previously returned by someone else after being washed.
B0025Q9W7Y|1|This case doesn't hold much of anything.  I could only get two credit cards in it and I suspect you wouldn't get many business cards in it either.  What a waste of money.
B000FAJMC2|1|I washed these for the first time about a week ago prior to wearing. With other Wranglers I own of the same size, 40x30. First thing I noticed was the outer belt label was different, not the same as stretch denims bought in local western wear stores. They also seemed lighter, not the heavier material of others bought locally, all stretch denim. I wear Wrangler dress pants to work and they even seemed lighter than those. When I put them on for the first time they would not button, not even close. They seemed more like 36x30, at least two sizes smaller than all others I own, all 40x30. I checked the inside label, which was also different, but it said 40x30. Both labels do not look like the others, typical Wrangler logo labels. Looked cheaper. I honestly wondered if were &#34;fake&#34; Wranglers. I would definitly not buy again off Amazon. Sheplers, Cavendars, I would online, but these are not the same as the stretch denim I've purchased from those stores, in store and online. There's no reason every other of 8 pair of 40x30's fit perfect, these with different labels seem two sizes too small. Hung in the closet, likely give to Goodwill, tell them 36's mislabeled.
B00WDPPMRG|5|So cute! Soft cotton material. Im actually surprised about the great quality at such and unbeatable price! These got for 8$ a piece on etsy!
B0047R0ECG|5|It is light wallet, fitting for summer cloth.
B0056FGFD0|4|Perfect
B00FWH8FJE|4|Cute bra but it fits a little bit too large.  when first purchasing a bra you shouldn't have to put it all the way on the third level, you normally gradually do that as you wash and wear your bras, but this one although the cup size fit i had to do a lot of adjusting as soon as i purchased it.  Overall though, it's a pretty bra and fits nicely once you've done the adjustments, but i'm afraid it won't be one that lasts very long.
B00HYZI6N2|5|This style of nursing tank is a great idea - much less bulky than wearing a nursing bra and a regular nursing tank on top of it.  It fits well and it's nice that it isn't tight up top like some slimming tanks are.  Keeps the nursing tatas comfortable :-).
B0010KXA4W|1|I bet these ear warmers are very warm. But I wouldn't know since I never got them. I thought Amazon had no limits. But I was wrong.<br />I bet these ear warmers are very soft. But my friend Brandon wouldn't know since he never got them. He thought Amazon would never leave him behind. But he was wrong.<br />I bet these ear warmers are a great product. But my friend Jason wouldn't know since he never got them. He thought Amazon would be on point, 24/7. But he was wrong.<br />It could be the case that my friend never ordered them. But I can't believe that. He was willing to sacrifice $5 for us.<br />I guess I could still order these, but I mean it's like spring now.
B001QFZOR2|5|When our granddaughter called and asked grandpa for a \\"pink dress with Dora on it\\" I started shopping.  No mall store had such a thing.  So I went searching online.  We were pleased to find this dress, order, ship directly to the little princess and get calls of joy.  Thanks for a great product.
B0029Y616M|5|Got this for my friend's bachelorette party and we sewed a veil onto it. Perfect accessory for the bar crawl night out.
B003JYSFJW|3|Looks like a well made bra, however it's too large. I wear a 34 B and the fit was more like a 36 C.<br />I had to return it.
B00ADE67DC|5|Jacket fits well and is very comfortable.  Wish they came in more colors.  The outfit comes in handy on vacation.
B00CFIB540|3|These gloves were a gift. They were great initially in light warmth. The touch screen compatibility was fantastic. Unfortunately they fell apart within two months. I guess you really do get what you pay for (They were super cheap in both ways)!
B0012M83M2|5|Wow
B00ZTK4TFI|2|The fabric was listed as cotton but it is clearly not. It's made of some synthetic fiber.
B004A8UMLK|5|I ordered 2 bras from this company in not so popular sizes (32DDD) and they fit perfect!! Also the quality is good! Thanks so much!
B007MD4TEQ|5|Thanks for a great deal and fast shipping
B00E0KHTKA|1|What I received, was not an Allegra K piece. It was a cheap knock off. As always, when I order what I believe to be Allegra K, and receive an imitation, it never fits correctly. The sleeves are ALWAYS to tight for one thing, and the sizing is never accurate. I was truly disappointed to receive this. If it had been a TRUE Allegra K piece, it would have fit perfectly. The item I received didn't even have a tag. Allegra K, ALWAYS has the brand name tag in it, ALWAYS!
B00Q4RN2WG|4|Like it...
B00OBU7OQI|3|I like this cardigan, but the fabric is very thin and does not have any body to it so I returned it.  Also, the color is not as rich as it appears in the photo.
B005GVHKR4|5|I can wear them as dress pants for work or just pants around the house. No matter what they are so comfortable. I own about 4 pairs.
B005NX26CE|5|nice colors and the whole idea behind this product is great. so much easier to change them when they're wearing a onesie with leg warmers rather than pants over a onesie.
B00M5SMLES|5|Don't know what shirt reviewer got that said screen print was poor quality. This shirt shipped fast (ordered late Wednesday  night around midnight and it arrived  Saturday afternoon mail). Quality of the shirt is nice, my husband was pleased! I got it for his birthday. Screen print was nice and vivid too. Especially on the navy t-shirt. I got large and it fit him nicely. Runs like any other large t-shirt in the mall or at Wal-Mart. I'll wash it in cold water turned inside out. I'm ordering my son one too. I ordered another shirt from another company at the same time as this one. I must say, this one is as nice in quality as the other one, and the other one cost a little more.
B005FN1MFO|5|love the fit and I love Jockey
B00A3V6B6I|5|4th pair. Great Value
B00FBD2G0I|4|I like the socks, but they are somewhat large.
B00IJJQ25G|5|Boyfriend loves it.
B009YBRWSY|5|FUROCITY HATS 100% Polyester Fur Leafy Camo Trapper/Bomber Hat - Autumn hat fits so nice feel so good omg love it i recommend this seller
B00AW1IQXK|5|This Pashmina is terrific. I ordered four for myself and three management assistants so we can be easily identified (we work in a theater). The color is rich and beautiful. The scarf is soft and drapes well.  They have a nice sheen but if you're looking for a matt wool look, this is't the scarf for you. We all wear them with black and they are stunning. I am not sure how they will hold up, but probably won't need to be laundered often so I am optimisitc that they will last and hold their rich green. The price is certainly right. I'd order this again in several other colors.
B000VK7OTE|5|Love Glamorise bras, but this is a go to bra for any occasion and any breast size! So comfortable and quality made.
B00CHFLHFS|5|I ordered the dress in red in an XS and it fits me perfectly! Yes it is a little snug, but it helps keep your body slim and sexy. It's like a built in spanx in a dress. I have ordered 2 dresses from this seller and is very satisfied. I plan on buying every color they have :))
B0044FRY7Y|5|I have a large head, size 7 5/8, and this fits perfectly, sits nicely just over the ears, and basically looks like a cap should look. The regular ones (that I normally get free) look goofy on me as they are always too small, because even with the strap let out they sit too high. Love it!
B00DD0BBSE|5|Perfect. Thanks
B00OU76SDC|4|Husband loved these!
B004R8Z34O|5|They are not so much skinny I think (for me - I usually wear skinny jeans) but look great as expected. Good looking lower waist and that's big plus for me. The fabric is great. Waist is little bit loose so don't worry about it, just order your normal size. I order size 31 but normally wear 30 so next time i'm gonna buy size like always wear(30).
B003552OJ2|5|It fits perfectly, is not tight but still hugs you and doesn't make you feel strangled when you sit down and bend over. The micro fiber is so comfortable it's like it's not even there.
B00FFEQBPO|5|This is a unique amazing piece of artwork.  Absolutely adore it.  Highly recommend to anyone who likes this sort of thing.  The price may seem high when first viewing, but once you see the quality of the buckle you will understand that you actually got a bargain, such is the workmanship and high quality materials used in its production.
B00NZCLM3E|2|the fit was very small. Plus this is NOT a wrap dress. it is over the head and the shoulders are very puffy from the fabric being gathered. not my style at all and could not tell from the picture.
B005V5E3CK|3|Pretty. Flirty. Fun.
B0064LDE0W|5|exceptional bra, great price, quick shipping
B00GO0FMTO|5|very nice shirt it fits a little bigger but i like that so good job peeps
B000GKWCK0|5|<br />That was my boyfriend's quote. <br /> <br />I'm 5'9\\" and it was still long enough to hang well. While I wouldn't expect it to last years, I don't think it'll have that chance ...
B006IPSOZY|4|nice colors, good fit at first, colors faded in areas and the shirt shrunk when washed. item just as pictured. quick shipment. I would order from this seller again in the future.
B0055MW8US|5|Just as pictured and fit excellently
B005ISU2IY|1|Don't waste your money. It's not flexible (i.e. good luck sitting with this thing on), and very clumsy looking+feeling with this thing on.
B007IJXBZM|3|I am 5'5&#34; and the 30&#34; is just a little too short. Also if you are doing anything on the floor, the pant bottoms will slide up. The fabric is polyester and slippery. I don't find them flattering but if that's not important, then they are fine.
B00GYT5V14|1|i bought this and large came,material is crap ...bad purchase
B00K8AIBI0|5|Very nice and colorful boxer briefs which fit great and very comfortable.
B00E006B5Y|5|Excellent seller! Quality fabric. I chose a medium size based on previous reveiws. Fits perfect on me.
B002YDDBDE|5|I love it, my daughter and niece cried.  They are 2, hopefully they will do better next year.
B004TLE67O|5|I have a passion for learning about Autism and supporting the various causes that go along with Autism. This is a great addition to my growing collection of puzzle pieces for Autism.
B00LLASYG0|2|Very cute shorts. They are very small. Some may like that look, we did not.
B00JZTJ774|5|This penny is very nice and quite unique. The 3 shamrocks are real neat addition to the coin. I like it alot.
B00KRYPQTY|4|It is a great sweater for everyday use. I have already washed it once and the color still looks the same.
B0031U0POM|5|nice
B004Q2PQ1G|4|Loved this costume.  The only thing I didn't really like was how the cape was hard to wrap around my shoulders without it falling off.
B0084AVVO2|3|the fleece is very light so cold air is gonna go right thru the jacket in Winter. The large ran a bit larger and longer than I expected.  The model shows the jacket at about hip length, but I am almost 6 feet and the Large goes past my butt.  Its a nice spring/fall jacket and the olive-green and black plaid rocks.
B003NTUA6O|4|Nice quality wool tie. Color is Very Dark. At any distance at all it would appear black. In  you can see the slight brown tone in full bright sunlight but not indoors. But it is a very nice wool tie.
B00E7Z7RSM|5|My daughter loves dr. Who so, what more could a fan ask for? It fits well and is very warm. Very well made also. I recommend this for any die hard fan!
B00EWWIHKC|5|Perfect fit as I expected as always. Jockey never disappoints.
B00CJ511RU|5|Gorgeous dress! Very formal
B00D8U6Q2A|5|Loved it, just as described. Jacket is very soft, and pants/shirt are nicely made. Overall good product to buy for yourself/gift.
B0084HMSBU|4|I really like the fit of these scrubpants, but they do tend to be a little tight in the thigh area.
B00AHC9D2W|5|Just enough cushion and support in these socks. It's fun to wear the pink, blue and green pairs to work! I will buy this brand again.
B00DC391WU|2|This shirt comes from over seas and apparently their sizing chart is much different than ours.  I ordered an extra large - it took forever to come and when it finally did it fit me like a sausage casing - I wound up giving it to my 10 year old granddaughter to wear.
B000FEEMZU|5|This shirt is very nice and the quality is very good. We like the color.
B005X5HJEM|4|Great bra for hard work outs if you're a G cup. Underwires can be pokey and I can't seem to get one to last longer than 6 months.
B0048BJB6G|4|Very cute and comfy. Would be nice if breast coverage little bigger to accommodate larger breast. Like inside slip, not see through
B00GM3U9TQ|5|I bought this for my dad for his birthday and he loved it! I bought him the 2XL, he said it was a bit large and after a wash it fist perfect.
B00A727WKW|3|haven't used it yet - but it seems like it'll be tough to get it to sit &#34;just so&#34;. We'll see.
B00IPO91X0|3|Bought this in 2 sizes because I wear M or L depending on the top.  Unfortunately, the M was too tight over the boobs and the L was way too big in the arms and too loose to wear under a top.
B002BX2FWK|1|I was very disappointed on the quality of this item  the hem was unfinished & I thought it was a slip not a dress
B009KYAWAU|5|This was used as a dance costume and worked out perfectly.  Easy to move in as well.
B000KGKBOY|5|Excellent
B00CPKR3IU|5|Love this wallet. It's sturdy, stylish, and can fit a bunch of cash, can't ask for much more. It's also worth noting that I've damaged a handful of credit cards by keeping them in other wallets, the bar on the back of the cards deteriorates and eventually won't work. This hasn't happened with this wallet.
B00LK09LSG|5|Husband  says  they are very comfortable
B002YEYTDY|5|Great support! I'm a DD, really an E. This fit fine. Held up all evening.
B00D73AMPA|1|faulty advertised on the size !!
B00FR9K8BK|5|I have these pants in black, navy, and brown and have been very happy with them. Just bought the heather taupe and had to post a comment - they are so beautiful! I love the color. Looks very expensive to me. These are perfect for work and will get worn weekly!
B009HQLX4K|5|The first time I wore them I knew I would never be satisfied with another brand.  They are a great petite fit (although may be a tad long for some). I am 5'2&#34; and 113 lbs, but probably not a true petite because I have long legs, which means I can wear these without giant heels. (It doesn't specify, but I think the inseam is around 31&#34;. I usually wear a 2 or 4 in pants. I got the 27 and they fit great (although I may have been able to squeeze into a 26. They are super-soft and comfortable, and I disagree with the commenter who said they had too much stretch; I didn't find that at all (only 2% spandex).  I have gotten tons of compliments on them. I'll be looking for them when they go on sale again, since shelling out $158 for jeans really goes against the grain--but these are pretty much worth it.
B007W0XRKQ|3|The padding is thick!  I guess if you're looking for something to give you a whole new behind this might be for you!  I felt ridiculous.
B00XHKCAPS|1|Way to small. Not sure where they are getting their sizes but the biggest size they offer (which would normally be my size) fit my sister that is 8 sizes smaller than me.
B009XHYNYU|4|I bought this for my grandson. It is so cute; he will wear it running through the house, and he also loves to snuggle up in it.  He is almost 2 and a size 2T.
B000A38DKG|4|I have worn these pants before.  They offer good value and comfort when sitting for long periods.
B00R3A6LIU|5|Perfect dress for Sunday Brunch!
B00400OQYM|2|I was disappointed and will not recommend to my friends, they tore when I first put them on and I ordered a larger size.
B00MENH5X6|5|So cute for newborn
B002WLNAE8|2|Seems very cheap, like a child's toy.
B002SIFHLO|2|-THE fiber composition of this garment is: 50% acrylic, 28% polyester, 10% wool, 10% nylon, 2% spandex. -Which means the fiber composition advertised by \\"Silvermoon\\" is false.<br />-Tag also reads this is \\"tabbisocks\\", of View Point International Corp., California. (for shopper reference / pleasure)<br />-I would still love this sock amazon is advertising(... with the cotton,) but i'm having doubts it exists. I bought the grey-colored one for me, and my relative likes it, as an alternative to return and or refund.<br />Who knew -<br />I marked 2 for rate because it means \\"i don't like it\\".<br />Thank you.
B00IDF8HS6|5|It fit exactly as expected. Great, great quality of work and the fabric is very nice. The flower sash looks very nice and is also good quality. I ordered two of these dresses for my two girls. I ordered their regular sizes (10, 16) and both fit wonderfully. When you put it on at first it seems like it may be a little too big, but once you tie the bow in the back it's a perfect fit. Both girls were comfortable enough to move freely and wear these dresses most of the day. And they just adored how the layers of fabric fluttered out as they spun around. There are 4 layers to this dress, the 'slip' inside layer, the solid layer which you can see in the photos, and two layers of tulle fabric, one full length and the other just a little shorter with ribbon on both hems. If you think you may need to have this dress shortened, order it in plenty of time for a seamstress to work on all 4 layers, and keep it mind it will not be cheap, but it will be ADORABLE.
B00SC70X8C|1|This is a very poorly made jacket, the quality is not there!
B00GTGRMSC|5|Great jeans.
B00LJTXLZ2|5|Goood<br /><br />Thanks<br />A+
B008ROZKJ2|2|As I scrolled down the comments I read several statements in which lead me to believe this mask would fit an adults male's head...how wrong they were. While the mask was an exellent choice for the price and the texture made it very elastic,  it unfortunatly was extreamly tight and barely fit over my head. Now granted these individuals who've bought the mask and have had succsess have smaller skulls than I do, but knowing that sooner would have been very beneficial and less time consuming.
B00LH5JQDE|4|This dress is very gorgeous, I loved it very much but I order the wrong size. I have to return it and order again
B00AYK3D5A|4|Good product
B008BAN9YU|4|My old Army web belt finally wore out and I've been looking for a replacement. Couldn't find the genuine article so I tried this one since it's the same width. The belt material itself is not as heavy as the original but not bad, especially for the price. I expect it will last plenty of time to get my money's worth from it. The buckle feels cheap but I swapped it with the one from my belt and all is good.
B00KAPNDOK|5|Love these!! Had them years ago and loved them then, too. So comfortable.
B001SBJWT0|5|Finding it on the web saved me much time  and many steps.  It is just as described.
B005DTE7S4|4|The fabric was not as expected.
B003ZHXYAS|5|I am not sure why people shock their boobs...or need a shock absorbent bra...but if I get struck my lightening I am now covered!
B008EHW7ZC|4|I wear a 5/6 normally and ordered the small.  I should have ordered a medium if I plan on wearing anything bulky, like a sweater.  The coat is definitely well-made and looks beautiful.  However, I need a larger size to wear anything other than a blouse under it.
B00JLAYYWK|5|My dad loves it a lot. I should try a larger one.
B00M0HV34I|5|It was just what it was described as
B009D1ILRG|5|Perfect can not see the straps when wearing certain tank tops.
B0044C3LRY|4|Comfortable and fit fine. Would buy more if I needed to.
B008MTX8BE|3|The shirt is an super way for for daughter to show her love for the show and maintain her modesty. The products in the marketplace in general lack appropriateness (coverage and content) that is required in a many areas of society. In this case they hit the mark and got the sale :-0) Please by up size, this runs extremely small. My daughter wears a XS , I purchased a Medium, and it was a slim fit
B00GY0GPAE|5|I love those bra's! So comfortable !
B00M8ILBE6|2|To little and thin
B005EOKEO4|4|I used this for a costume party and it was well-priced and good quality
B0060KYQYK|5|These are awesome.  They hold well, the coloring is nice.  A well-made suspender.  No complaints. I need more wrods for the review.
B00EE838E4|5|Bought it for my nephews birthday who loves these characters and he really love the shirt and its a good quality.
B0028P9CMM|2|Cheap price, cheap quality, the stars and the moon were not stitched on the edges so they folded in on themselves and were not identifiable as stars and moon. The hat was flimsy and did not stand up on its own, if you purchase know you will need to use a paper cone to help keep the hat in shape so it does not flop over and you may need to tack or stitch the edges of the shapes. my opinion spend a little more money for a higher quality product with a sturdier build to it. I bought it for a drama club play and they did not use it if that helps you decide on this product.
B00ICJ9C8M|1|I thought I was getting a dress like in the picture, but I got a yellow gold dress that could have fit a 12 year old.
B00KTJSB8K|1|Sooooo small, that didn´t fit at all!!!<br />:( so sad becasuse the texture of fabric is really nice!!
B00KTHZZF4|3|I love that it so easy to wash and never wrinkles.
B007518BQC|5|Its perfect. I work in EMS. And this jacket is perfect, it is safe for screen printing any logo. It folds into itself into a small ball that you can attach to a caribener. I wear a XXL in shirts and true to size.
B005UPZGWM|5|Works just as advertised...restores shoe's shine and repairs minor scuffs better than anticipated! I highly recommend this product for both brown and black shoes of any style !
B00FARDBWM|2|Not at all long like the photo illustrates. Just a touch longer than a regular tank. Dissapointed as it was not what I had expected.
B004QXRG5Y|5|Love it!!
B007BI92H6|3|I thought I was getting 2 bibs from the picture... the picture is deceiving because it shows the 2 bibs, but I guess they are just showing you the front and the back of the bib. I think it was over priced since it was just the 1 bib.
B0027G0EGK|1|I received my t-shirts and I feel cheated is of very poor quality and very poor finish, is not what I chose, no volvere to buy this product here.
B001MDD7C2|1|When I got this I could not believe how big this was. I really believe this was a 4X. I ordered a XXL and I could have wrapped myself in it twice.
B001J1OE4M|5|This pack of bands is perfect to keep in your duty bag or car.  I seem to lose mourning bands pretty frequently, so this ten pack was just the ticket.
B00CH4OWEM|4|this robe was alittle big for my wife, but the quality of the material is excellent. The hood adds an extra touch of comfort. If you want to keep warm, this is it for you.
B00E7ONZJ8|5|The shirt fit great and he wears it all the time. And I would recommend the shirt to all. thks
B005GYGFZY|5|They fit great. Liked them so much I bought 2 more pairs. They arrived very quickly as well. Definitely recommend these workout pants.
B00B42VYHQ|5|I was so excited because i have been looking for nicely priced thigh high socks. I am 5'11&#34;, so i have VERY long legs. I got the large size because id rather it be too big than too small! well they went up to exactly were i was hoping, about mid thigh! At first it only went above the knee but i had a lot of extra fabric down around my feet, so if it doesnt go up too high try pulling the extra fabric by your feet up!<br />WARNING, I am 5'11&#34; and only 135lbs. So i am rather skinny, and i am rather fit. These fit perfectly, a little snug, but nothing that i couldnt breath in. I would not think that if you are much heavier, or if you have thicker thighs, this would probably not be a good fit, as they are snug on me, not tight, but snug.<br />But they came within 3 business days and i am very pleased with them!!!! :)
B00L2ZK3I6|5|These are my favorite shorts now, like a comfortable extra skin.  Heavier than yoga pants, actually more comfortable.  That's something I thought I'd never find.
B00N9ZHVYG|5|so comfortable
B002IRQ35E|4|I am happy with the purchase. The wool is very soft, but holds heat. I bought a color med blue, but the color is actually much darker than in the photo and looks like navy.
B005EXGVAG|1|CHEAP MATERIALS. RIPPED FIRST TIME I PUT THEM ON.
B0018OOZNU|5|Excellent product, original, I would buy again. The product I bought says &#34;Made in Mexico&#34; but the fabric is good and durable, those who arrive in Venezuela say &#34;Made in Colombia&#34; the fabric is bad. Thank you, Regards.
B00NIAFHVG|5|Super cute!
B003JE62SS|4|All I have to say is that this is am amazing hoodie. My girlfriend is a HUGE 30 Rock fan and she loves it. The quality of the material is excellent and it runs a little small, so if buying for a man and you/they where a large, get the XL. Aside from the fact that it's black (Liz Lemons was gray) and the iron on Tracy Jordan logo, it's a great product.
B00O1CAMZQ|3|ok so far
B00CDBT9O2|5|I love Kut, and their products. But the Natalie is... weird.<br /><br />I have ordered this style in multiple colors. The Vagos being one of the best.<br /><br />A bit about me: while I am a size 7 and normally fit comfortably a size 8, I tend to go with size 10 because I like the extra breathing room because I am moderately active (I walk (briskly) well over 5 miles a day and work in a lab). If I had my way, I'd get a nine but that's neither here nor there.<br /><br />So, back to the Natalie. And specifically, the Vagos wash.<br /><br />In Vagos, the inseam of both the 8 and the 10 are the same. 33 inches - How do I know? I ordered both. I thought the 10 was a tiny bit long, and got the 8. Same length. The 10 is Vagos is... actually a little more loose than I prefer, and even the 8 feels like a 9. In other washes, like Proud? The 10 is almost too tight, like a 7 (true story).
B00MCWWINQ|4|I bought a XL for my 11 years old girl, but it fits tight my girl is 80 pound, en 5'1 her physical complexion is thin.
B00LMKLEOS|4|good
B004G0ABUY|4|Awesome love this brand I bought all different colored sleepers in size 6 months - my only thing is the hat is clearly for a newborn- why not a 6 month hat?? My 5 month old fits the sleeper but the hAt is way to small
B003WM586O|5|Love Landau scrubs.  Got them quickly.  Very pleased.
B005FUKOWO|4|I found that because there is no stretch to them they run small. No problem though, I simply returned for a size up. They are good quality pants.
B00ENF6OCG|2|I thought this hat was really cute so I bought it. When I received it I found out that it was purple. Apparently their grey is a purple.
B00JVYSFD0|5|Love it.
B002PR2TUU|3|I just got the item in the mail today and the mask is fairly wide. Some paint was charred off the product and you had to self tie the cheap straps. On the positive side, this product is still fun to look at and wear. I would recommend this product for masquerade lovers because this tragedy mask is fairly unique due to it's nice color patterns.
B009D7IGOI|5|I did like the button and now it is a treasured souvenir as we lost. I will always dream of what it would have been like to have an adult in the White House.
B00J9A9R6A|5|Most comfortable thong for the price. Great looking& hot look!
B00BFNZJX4|5|These are so comfortable. I was wearing Jockey low-rise briefs for years and Jockey fit me well. I decided to try these and I love them. The most comfortable underwear I have ever worn. I will be buying more soon.
B0096R11T2|4|These are strong bras they hold up way better then the other bras I ordered from amazon only problem I have is that its a little tight but do able.
B00LHSLS1Y|5|I am large. 6'1&#34; 270lbs and these fit me fine. I will buy again
B00MAOT74Y|5|The are just what I needed and wanted. They keep my feet nice and warm and that is what I wanted.
B00I31ADLO|5|Love love love it great Hat
B0045H0L1W|4|Is a good buy and a good product. I highly recommend it to everyone, I liked the quality and filled my expectation.
B00EPE5E76|3|Would fit better if they weren't so low cut. Also a bit long in the legs. A few defects in the front, material worn very thin will probably tear soon.
B00AUEL7OO|5|Great cargo pants. I work in apartment maintenance and love the extra pockets for little things like wire caps, screws, etc. when I am en route to the same building to do 2-3 work orders that encompass different tasks.<br /><br />I bought a 33x30 and they fit perfectly. I will be buying a camouflage pair for woodsball (paintball in the woods). They move that well!<br /><br />The flaps on the back and lower-leg pockets are a little stiff; sliding my Galaxy Note 3 with a rubberized case into them can be frustrating, but that's mostly my fault for having such a large phone with a case that has material that doesn't just slide on the pants material.
B000OR9GA4|2|The 1st time I wore it, I was very happy.  But, after the first hand wash, it was never the same.
B00HXJV43S|2|It was not cut correctly, really disappointing
B00PMLMM3U|5|Perfect
B004GHNTF6|4|Comfortable to wear with a smooth back. Nice!
B00BJORNSI|5|Very comfy!
B005EZ2838|5|Purchased for my son for baseball season.  Fits well and provides lots of padding - in my opinion better than just a heart guard - protects a larger area.
B005GV6624|4|I thought they would look dressier
B00QV54GEY|5|Good
B00HZJC65Q|5|Very comfortable, fit as expected.
B001DCHFMU|2|I am a little disappointed in this jama, seems quite cheap. But bought 2others that is just beautiful, this was made in China, you(Amazon)don't need to represent this product anymore.
B00CW8XTI8|5|Top was purchased to match a pair of purple cotton  flannel pajama bottoms. Seems good quality .3/4 length are a good all purpose length to span three seasons(fall, winter, spring)
B00IRPXH8C|1|yuck.  appears to be a polyester blend.  too small to really accessories with.  would not recommend to anyone.  no thanks
B00JSNDKXY|5|I love this bra.  I was reluctant to try an underwire but this bra is so well made that it's actually very comfortable.
B0059UYB10|5|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son.  He loves how soft it is and he feels &#34;grown up&#34; wearing a bathrobe.
B00MHDY70M|3|Too tight in the arms. Quality is good though.
B00HBC1CNE|3|I hoped this was as nice as a similar one I had bought from Gymboree when my daughter was young, but the print is only on the front, and the fabric is very flimsy and a little see-through. She can wear it with a slip.
B00K6K9EYW|5|Ordered this in a 5 a little to big but that's ok it's feels really nice and the colors are great. My little man really likes this wore it the next day.
B003VMWOQM|4|I think they look great on my husband! ...he complained the pockets felt *short* to him.
B008F6GJ88|3|Lovely black sweater but its too large for me and I ordered small be careful with the size info if your gonna purchase one
B00A76P38G|2|The stripe pattern on the dress is not exactly as pictured; where there should be a slimming smaller stripe near the waist, there isn't. The wider band at the top that is pictured also is missing. The way the stripes are placed is not very flattering on me. I bought a medium and it just kind of hangs. I have a small torso, but I'm 5'7\\" and close to 150 lbs.  Not tiny.  Disappointed.
B010MSS984|5|I was really worried that it was going to be too small even though I am very petite. However, it fits perfectly! Not too loose, not skin tight. And comes pre-shrunk so didn't need to worry about it shrinking in the washer. Great buy!
B003BQ05IM|5|I love this visor. It's big, but it's also fun and stylish. It's exactly what I was looking for to keep the sun and my hair off my face.
B001KFTIUW|5|every thing is great I would have liked pockets but that's what handbags are for....
B00LIWQMEC|5|My daughter loves it and looks amazing in it.  It's a rich, beautiful color, and she loves the sparkle.  Great buy.
B00JKFO6OW|2|This jacket is way too large.  I ordered a size Large(7).  This jacket was much bigger than a Little Boys size 7.  It was more like a jacket for a 15 year old.  Second, this says its a &#34;Hooded Coat&#34;.  I would not consider this a coat.  It is nowhere near warm enough or have the insulation to be a winter coat.  It is at best a Fall/Spring Jacket for 50 degree weather.  It looks nice and functional for Fall Jacket.  I got this for $19.99 on a Deal of the Day discount.  I would say that it is worth $19.99 and if they fix the description so the customer knows that this is a Fall jacket and correct the size then it would be a good purchase at around $20.  At list price of $31 I think you can find better.
B0051GOJ1O|2|Nice until it lasted. Bad experience for myself as well. Padding shrunk after about 10 - 12 rides it has gotten as thin as a wafer and I might as well be riding in my underwear. Did not happen with other shorts I have been using for about 2 years. You get what you pay for I suppose.
B00AECCYSA|5|Great!
B003DX4DIG|4|This is a nice shirt for the price. It is a little thin, and see through, so you may need to have it worn over an undershirt. It washes nicely and looks good.
B0008EOFFO|5|Quick service, great product, good price!!!  Both pairs were given as gifts & greatly appreciated!  The tall guys got jeans that fit!!Thanks!!
B00LHH9PVA|5|Gorgeous style and shape. I ordered a small, I'm 5'7 and pretty thin. These are not too thin like some cheaper, spandex leggings. They are more like yoga capris, which is exactly what I needed. I use them for dance. Look fine with seamless panties, but don't wear your grannypanties with these. Arrived quickly and great purchase.
B002CWIP06|1|I usually don't comment on reviews, but I wanted to make sure no one else gets caught in this trap. Make sure you do not go by the sizes listed!! In most instances this is what we all do, but for some reason in this case, the company is claiming that Amazon puts up these sizes as just general sizes and it's not their problem if it does not fit their sizes. So make sure if you want this shirt you order it 2 or even 3 sizes bigger! I didn't and when I returned it I had to pay for both the original shipping and the cost of returning it. These were not included in the refund. Even after I wrote them explaining the issue, they will not reimburse the shipping. It is not their problem if the sizes are wrong. So if you are a large, do NOT buy a large or even an extra large. The x large is like a SMALL. I'm giving this company a 1 star for customer service. :(
B00AVVALRK|3|Buy a size larger than needed!!
B00ANKOZWQ|3|this would be a much better garment if it did not have the second layer that added seams. you can not get a smooth &#34;skin&#34; like look due to the added layer with both front and back seams they show through form fitting cloths
B0013B5E0G|5|Very comfortable, I like forgetting I'm wearing it, even by the end of the day.  Will purchase again when needed
B00CO5945Q|5|I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. Great fit without being too bulky and priced exceptionally well.
B00FPHXVFE|5|excelente
B00EU644GQ|5|I own three pairs of these pants, they all fit great. Great for hiking as well as training. Great price!
B00FSB3PVC|3|The size small was perfect (I am 5'2\\" 115 lbs 36-27-36). The sleeves were neither too long nor too short (came down to the spot between my wrist bone and my hand). Someone with broader shoulders might find the cut restrictive, but on me it was fitted without being too snug. There were many loose threads, and random holes opened up in the seams after being worn three times.
B005C9GNDC|5|I ordered these for my husband, and he like them very much. He like the  it a loose fit . Very good price and a  buy.
B00697ZIQE|5|Great bra. I liked this one so much I purchased another Calvin Klein bra with a racerback style. It fits well.
B005CW06X2|5|Thank u
B00CBBFRCM|1|Terrible.  I received it with a missing button and it's small.  It doesn't hang off my shoulder like in the pic and I'm a small girl.  Cheap material too
B00FEY82R0|4|Lovely!
B00X63060W|4|The fabric is a fairly thick jersey, which to me, is an improvement over what's available in stores. It also is a longer length than I expected, firmly below the knee, which is better for entertaining guests post partum. I do wish it was cut a little bigger in the belly.
B00H9VRIVC|5|Baby isn't here yet but i'm sure it will fit perfectly on him.
B00D8APCH0|5|I don't know if the company makes these jeans too big on purpose, but it sure makes me feel good!!
B00JG3EA6M|5|Perfect dress! I love it!
B009GHTGEE|4|The fit, look, color and style was what I expected.  Goes from casual to work easily.  Great buy in a difficult to find size.
B001JBNDM6|5|A great deal
B00TFCKEYQ|5|Love this dress! Very stylish and comfortable.
B00COH1EZM|5|I am 5'9 about 150#, I am a athletic cut and the small fit me perfectly. They are very comfortable and nice quality
B00B8EJD0U|5|My 6 year old son is into EMS gear. This hat is the coolest piece of EMS gear I've ever seen.  The raised letters and the star of life in two locations really made him happy.  He wears it all the time.
B00AMY1SC8|5|Bought this for my daughter since northern states having such cold weather. Cold, warmth and size perfect! She loved it and wants other colors.
B00553XN38|4|Fits snug but very nicely made. Little bit uncomfortable, but great just to wear for a short period of time
B000QX4BI8|2|I needed a Halloween costume, and this served the purpose, but it was made of an inferior material and was not comfortable to wear. I did not wear the &#34;hat&#34; since it looked ridiculous. For the price I was disappointed.
B0052OSATC|5|Fits good.  Looking forward to trying them out this spring.
B00IMMT7DY|4|Beautiful,it's very useful.
B00FRIGHNE|3|Runs smaller than advertised, but it's a beautiful swimsuit. I'm going to hang onto it and hopefully get into it in a couple of months.
B00XDQRW90|5|Love it, My daughter is just giving her first steps, for porcelain floor its perfect.
B001SN7PPG|5|My son loves this t-shirt. Fits as expected.
B003TPNA14|5|Shipping took a little longer than I liked, but it is still worth it! when I contacted the seller he stated that the shirts are print on order, so that is why it took longer. I always loved it when McCoy would say, &#34;Dammit, Jim! Im a doctor not a...&#34; Very nice shirt, good quality.
B00JJEHB5A|3|Surprisingly thin, see through.  Needs tank underneath.  Very soft, nice color.
B00HKDW0TY|5|SHE IS DELIGHTED WITH THIS DRESS, ALL HER FRIENDS WANT  ONE, PEEHAPS OTHER COLOR, BUT  BLACK IS NICE AND ELEGANT
B000E6NGK6|1|Size runs big
B000N8X7Z4|1|I've been wearing these shirts everyday for decades, I recently bought 6 of them, 4 were grey 2 were navy. The grey ones shrunk like never before the navy ones didn't.<br /><br />I've never had to worry about shrinking after washing before but I'm a sucker for punishment and am going to buy 4 more grey ones, but not dry them in the dryer.<br /><br />The washing instructions say to dry them on a low setting ...or...IN THE SHADE. That says it all right there.
B00GTFUR6W|5|Very good quality shirt with nIce material (not too thin). Love the green color and it fits as it should.
B0031TVTMU|4|These Tees are perfect and exactly what I was looking for. The missing fifth star is for the unpardonable sin of large sewn in tags that irritate the neck. Any garment worn against the naked body should have PRINTED TAGS!
B007R1Z942|4|No grommets to allow water out of the pockets. Else everything was good.
B00LCS06A8|5|Great  under wear
B00LO86PKG|2|they were fine, but after a few washings they started to fall apart
B00VBZQ9CG|5|Fabric is soft and thin; great for hot days. Cute scarf pattern. I bought it in blue. Nice fit.
B009TAWAYG|5|Gorgeous hat. Very warm. People always stop me to tell me how great my hat is :)
B006TUXFV6|4|My boyfriend has this top and I threw it on one day to run errands. I ended up ordering one for me I loved it so much. Since its soft and clingy, if you get the right size (does run a sz small) it looks incredibly flattering. I'm curvy, so the v neck hits at a great spot, and even in jeans and flip flops, I still feel cute. It's a cozy staple for a great price.
B009S4D1AA|5|Really cute gift for a wee one!!!
B00SZQOXSQ|1|One size fits all is far from the truth.  They are very small.  Sad too.  I wanted them for my trip.  Have them to my daughter so I didn't waste my money.
B00FIXRIMM|5|My young grandson loves all things Star Wars and specifically asked for Christmas pajamas that were from the movies. He was clear that he did not want Legos-themed Star Wars. It took a long time to find this set, but he loved it! Washed it up on Christmas Eve for him to wear to bed. Good quality and soft.
B00JGQTFFK|1|This item did not look at all as advertised. The goggles were completely clear, no black tint, and the mask was a washed out gray color rather than black. It also doesn't fit a very wide variety of head shapes (it was too big for my younger sister, whom I bought it for, and didn't fit my dad correctly, either). I would consider it a miracle that the textures on the mask are the only, and I mean only, thing about this product that looks right.
B00IVJ10HY|4|This shirt has two issues - it runs a full size small (as other reviews have indicated) and it is lightweight - not the usual cotton weight that I would expect from a snap shirt. It will be great in the summer months, but if you are ordering this thinking you are getting a shirt with the heft of an Ariat, you will be disappointed. That being said, I did order it a full size large so it fits the hubby nicely, it is a good looking and well-made shirt. Just know how to order it and what you will be getting, and you'll like it.
B000BWMVWW|2|No where in the item description does it say that it uses Velcro to keep the wallet closed. I feel like a twelve year old whenever I go to pay for something. It makes that loud separating Velcro noise every friggin' time. And unfortunately for me, it's not an \\"amazon.com\\" product, so the return process isn't as simple. I've been using it since 09/2007 and it still looks new, so that's a plus. And the outer edge is a harder material that just doesn't seem like hemp, though I'm not an expert and it could be. There is a plastic cover on the one side (inside) to hold your DL or other identification.
B002K8PKTG|5|This is a great bathing suit. I love not having to buy swim diapers. You can not beat the price. I wish it was available in more sizes!
B003DLTFPE|4|i love the design and fit of the hat the only dislike is the right wing of the larger emblem is cut off just by a little bit.
B00JWW45CG|5|Was a gift and she's happy....
B008KE47XE|5|Fits perfect, very comfortable. Very thin which was expected, good for summer use, 5'11&#34; 175 lbs athletic build, size large
B002HE0VBK|5|very happy...no problems...thank you...
B010MZUG7E|5|I love this tank.  It's my favorite summer outfit. But, it's sad that the best buy for a cute American tank is made and sold in China.
B0053XF8W4|5|Highly recommend this product for the price. The elastic stays put and never rolls down. It is comfortable to wear, easy to wash. Great product.
B007BLC4SC|3|Good quality but too large
B00KI16TQK|1|Adhesive does not work.  I had it on for less than 5 minutes when it started to come off
B008KE4I06|5|Not so sheer that I'm embarrassed to be seen in it, but with that great burnout look. Be careful about wearing a dark colored bra under it.
B00MNSDIQK|4|Overall, I liked this dress. I was afraid it was going to be thin and cheaply made. It seems pretty well-made, though. I had a few big issues though. First: Black/green is NOT true to color. I was expecting, obviously, a green color as pictured. Instead, I received some mint-teal combo. The color is okay, but it's not green. I was also very leery about the &#34;one size&#34; thing. I'm 5'7&#34; and a bit heavier. However, the dress fit very well. Usually in flow-y dresses like this, I feel like I look like a whale. This dress didn't make me feel that was. It is very long, though. In the chest area, however, everything is on display. The dress did not fit me like it does that woman in the display picture, not at all. I could not wear this without a bra. Not just a regular bra will do, however, because there's still boobs everywhere. I would have to wear a sports bra. I tried this, and in my opinion it didn't look bad, but it did look a little weird. With the low back on the dress, you could see the entire back of the sports bra. Mine was black, so it blended. I also have long hair that would kind of cover it up. But I absolutely would not wear this dress without a sports bra on unless I'm just lounging around the house.
B002K6F79Q|5|Good bra but order a size up. I'm a 36D and the XL fits fine. It's comfortable and easy to nurse with.
B00GJC931U|4|Smaller than I expected from a men's shirt but otherwise an ok purchase gave as a present. Good/ ok shirt
B00LSRU1QW|3|Material is kind of thin.
B00G4CQNCC|3|Nice robe overall and while soft, it was clearly brand new the material looked like it had already been used for years. I wanted something more luxurious and thick like a nice thick bath towel.  This felt more like something on the lower end.
B00138Q3WC|1|selling shirt without mentioning its size is a bit silly, no? please be so nice and update the text, will you?
B00G4CQ48A|5|Nice an soft.  cool and comfortable and would buy again.
B00D43EHM2|3|quality is ok
B00FFL73L8|5|Great Price and Fast Service !  AAA+++
B00B2GXYAY|5|Was very nervous about ordering online.  When I got this dress, for my granddaughter, it was just as beautiful on her as it is in the picture.  Nice quality!!! If I had to order this again I would have order a size up.
B002E9IR82|4|Nice belt- good quality but the small is still very big. I had to get more holes punched in it.
B00UK8NQVM|4|Boxy, but cute
B002N5PLDG|2|This costume was way too small. Very china sized.
B000HTIL14|5|Excellent
B00KE8HOSO|5|love them!  I'm 5'2 and they are too long but I expected that.  Otherwise I love them.
B00MYS6QJK|5|I am very glad I ordered the socks. They fit perfectly!
B00ASDBC60|1|Purchased these at a Menards. Have tried to use these with two different type shoes/boots.  They go on easily with the velcro straps, however the cleats turn easily to the side then as you are walking you step out of the strap (often without knowing it). Not at all recommended.
B00K3GVNBG|5|I love this shirt, it looks great on! Fits perfectly too. Very happy I ordered this item :)
B00696Q49K|5|I really like this dress. It fits like a glove, I wear size M, US 8  and this was like made for me. I will pair it with nice nylons and heels. Good quality , nice material. does not feel cheap.
B00KRJ1TH2|5|Goes great when driving my Jeep. I love these kinds of products. It fits a little small, especially after the first washing. I would probably try to get a size larger. Overall, I like it.
B00H9H2CZ8|5|Very cute and comfy, also warm and perfect for workouts or layering
B000QWDQYO|5|Goes perfectly under your t-shirts. Great for not rolling down at the top because of the straps and great slimming tool.
B00FB6H394|3|They look nice on.
B00GUZ2DYK|5|I love Jag Jeans!
B00H9GD1HC|4|Nice
B00274LPSI|2|I have several Henshel hats so I had no question of what size to order. The hat was a full size larger than the same size I already have and so the return would have been expensive. I gave the hat away of course. Henshel has a quality control issue. I won't order any more Henshel hats.
B00FGL9KFY|5|I used it during the winter and it didn't make me feel cold. I'm using it during the summer, and it doesn't make me feel too warm.
B00A77H96O|4|Terrific shirt...cool pattern!
B0009VT6MI|5|I bought this dress in Chocolate, and it's absolutely gorgeous! Good quality materials, well built, and tagged MADE in AMERICA! I also tried it in Gold and Black, but went with Chocolate because for my coloring and hair, the Chocolate was just too fabulous to pass up. It's a beautiful deep brown with a coppery satin sheen. Subtle, refined, but at the same time . . . Yowsa! My husband thought he was going to like the gold better, but one look at the chocolate and he was completely convinced.     Also, PacificPlex took good care of me and was very helpful. Shipping was quicker than I expected, and the flat rate shipping was very reasonable. I will definitely be a return customer.    One pointer: you should check the size chart for each item from PacificPlex, as they can vary from one item to the next.
B00KH5VQXI|4|This was the perfect accessory for our tie dye party.  It fit well and was cute!
B00JY70A6O|4|These pants color is slightly darker than I was expecting based on the image, but it is still a bright/vibrant color and it fits very well. I am 5' 5&#34;, however, and I think that a taller individual would have an issue with the length of the pants.
B00IVJ4J04|5|This is adorable! My son loves it! It's good quality and the propeller is flexible so don't worry about it breaking. It's smaller than a regular back-pack, perfect for a small kid.
B009180X3Q|4|These scrub pants fit well and the leg length is just right.  There is adequate room without the &#34;baggy&#34; look.
B00N17H0D4|4|Waist is unbelievably tight, while the rest of the garment is good quality.
B00J9WXYIK|3|It's a great shirt, but I can't really wear it without cringing a bit. I'm not huge, but when it said large, I think it meant more length than width. Still, it's a great shirt, I just need to tone up a bit before wearing it.
B00FLY4GSW|5|They fit great and look great. I'm 6 foot and they hit a little above the midpoint of my thigh so you do show more leg than traditional American swim trunks. Nice. Thing the ballon thing that you get with most swim suits doesn't happen as much, less excess fabric less weird air bubble.
B00B9VNKQU|5|The dress is very nice.  The material was great.  I received many wonderful compliments about it. And I loved the color.
B00M55YQIA|5|Very cute. Color and style is perfect. My 13 year old daughter loves it. It is very soft and warm. Not a stiff fabric.
B00KDMPZF0|4|Indiana Jones logos were annoying, but I was able to rub or peel them all off.
B004XOS1XM|5|Love it! fit perfectly seeing as I'm a 32 E which is not something you can get anywhere and great price :)
B006MHTZ06|2|They look notice, but don't think about using them if they are going to get wet or if it is really cold outside.  Then they are useless.  Good to use when it is cool outside, but not very cold.
B0049Z9OL8|3|I was all excited and couldnt wait to receive this necklace. I bought this as a gift and when I received it, I was very disappointed.  The necklace was beautiful and quite cool, but it was huge and bulky and I didnt see that the person I was buying this for would wear it.  If the necklace had been less bulky (thick) and heavy, I believe I would have like it more.  I ended up returning it. :(
B007G4VV74|1|Hate it!<br /><br />Since Timberland is &#34;thinking green&#34; we need to be careful before buying their products.<br /><br />They are using this new &#34;philosophy&#34; to sell us plastic products with a price of a leather product.
B00B6S69YG|4|True to size.
B008G0LAFU|4|A bit large BUT will work
B000UJGNFC|2|The 2 x talls,was a smaller fit than 2x
B00A3Q849K|1|It was so beautiful.  I thought it would be my newest favorite dress.<br /><br />The material is so flimsy, I don't think it will last more than two wears.  The material feels like what you expect from a halloween costume store, only worse.<br /><br />I am 5'2&#34; and weigh 100 pounds and there is no way this size 4 I bought is actually a size 4.  Length wise, maybe (it hits my knees, so way too long), but the waist fits me.  So I have no idea how a size 4 person would actually fit in this.<br /><br />I know it is beautiful, but you get what you pay for, and do not expect much, if anything.
B000FVY33E|2|The material is not gripping inside my shoes so walking was difficult. I actually stumbled a couple of times which I never do in these shoes.
B0065RITE6|1|terrible, very itch.  seams are falling apart and pompom is falling off.  I guess this is what you get for buying a $5 santa hat
B001D20FUY|1|This really makes a costume and I was looking forward to them but, I NEVER received them!!!  Maybe next time - thank you anyway.
B0006UKXLU|3|wear with slacks for a no-show look or wear with jeans for a rugged feel...just don't wear it on the field for support.
B00OXTEDRU|5|I simply like it.<br />XL fits as the chart states.
B00BIQ1WIO|5|It was perfect
B002DMV5GG|4|They are exactly what you'd expect...<br />They are clip-ons.
B000VCUGOW|3|Love the pants I ordered 3 pair only problem is they shrink a full size with the first washing.  So if you get them order a size bigger than what you need.  I orderd my actual size so after 1 wash they are now too small - really bummed out. :(
B00B1ZMCLI|5|Once I ordered the right size , cause they run small it is on now!!! I reordered the Red & Brown in Large & I really like the fit & the bow is sexy by the butt ! Telling everyone I know about the skirts & the price is really reasonable!!!
B000U8L2CC|4|I purchased this key chain for my sister who loves items with the sun on it.  It was much nicer than I expected.  The pewter is shiny and looks expensive.  I was very pleased and so was she!
B005JVRTF4|5|I absolutely love these shoes I bought them for my costume but I wear them out all the time they look fantastic with jeans they are well made and very comfortable.
B00B5IBWIK|4|I had been &#34;eyeing&#34;  this shirt hoping it would one day go on sale, so when the opportunity came, I whisked it up. This shirt is very comfortable and flattering. I am short and stubby and even with this shirt being on the longer side the angles somehow complemented me. I would recommend this shirt. I also did not find the shirt to be see through.
B00CA2W9VO|3|Buy about 2 sizes bigger than your normal size. But, nice product.
B008218I3K|1|I ordered jeans from this seller. As soon as I got them I knew something was awkward because the model was not the same as the model number (I ordered by exact product number because I wanted the same I had) but I thought it was my mistake since I trust Amazon.<br />Never used them. They just felt weird and for one reason or other I never wore them.<br />Recently I showed jeans to a friend that is a specialist in denim and he explained exactly how I could tell the jeans are fake diesels. They are a good copy, but they are fake, not as advertised, and i am sure the sellers know this and are fooling people on purpose.<br />The prize is the same as an original diesel.<br /><br />I will not stop until I get my money back and this crooks are out of Amazon.<br /><br />I am buying from Amazon since little after it was founded and I have faith they will protect me.<br /><br />I don’t care tha A-Z guarantee is expired, what is fair its fair and this is a SCAM. I hope its not Amazon endorsed.<br /><br />They are fake. I suggest you check here:<br />[...]<br />[...]<br /><br />These are good copies, but not original.<br /><br />I suggest you return and also please put a claim to Amazon.
B00FD2NYVM|5|This is Super awesome!! It Looks absolutely AMAZING  on my boyfriend. Just wanna jump on him when he wears it. Lol
B007JLD6X6|5|The colors are true to the picture and the fit is perfect.<br />I am 5''4 ( a female ) and weigh about 140. I have muscular build so this worked great.<br />Amazing shirt. True to its form!
B00YSLKS04|2|Very thin material, doesn't feel good.  Will be returning
B00EL43GOI|1|II order the headband for my daughter because I liked the color but when it finally came in the mail. It turned out to be<br />not the quality I expected. There was too much hot glue used to attach the flower to the headband part. It made the headband to bulky and I thought it would hurt my daughter's head.I will never order from this company again. I threw away the hat and did not use it.
B00YQ0KZ3W|1|It's an odd shape and much cuter in the picture than in real life
B007AGU3P4|5|Nice hat and good coverage.  I wish it had a drawstring for the convertible as I always have to have a 'hold' on it.  But other than that, it's perfect and very pretty.
B010MTE3OM|5|I love these pants. Comforable and great price
B00842ZMZ4|3|Hmm to start off, rhe \\"LRG brand embroider in the back of the jacket will fall off if you so much as wash it wrong or handle it with big rough hands (not mine in particular but another exact same jacket at Dillards).<br /><br />It fits me sung and well (\\"athletic\\" 5' 10\\" frame) due to LRG's notorious knack for making super oversized clothings. I wear regular Mediums and Larges for different clothing brands but those long LRG's mediums make me feel like I'm some rapper-wannabe from Boyz in Da Hood music video.<br /><br />Next flaw:  The zip button BROKE off when I tried to zip it up for the FIRST time ever after about some weeks of wearing it, since I never zip up my track jackets when I wear 'em; not many people do on a regular basis.<br /><br />Another \\"premium\\" (more like Another Outsourcing Brand's Capitalist Crap: AOBCC - I just made that up) clothing trying to reduce their exorbitant \\"premium\\" prices by using bottom of the line material and selling their popular brand.<br /><br />At least it looks stylish enough to make up for the crappy build.<br /><br />If you really want true premium clothing, you can't go (too) wrong with top tier brands like Prada, Gucci or Louis Vuitton or even other mid tier brands (less quality than top tiers) similar to LRG's standing like Coach, Guess or Perry Ellis. Save your money and go for higher tiers and save the headache and possible embarrassments.
B00IW8UFMK|4|I bought a medium and it fits nice. No complaints
B00D03UK04|4|I ordered these for my sister she is always wearing them, she says they are so comfortable and soft color hasn't faded after washing and either has the stretchiness she has washed them 4 times and she says feels like the first time she has put them on.
B00F2OONZW|5|Super soft and comfy! I love how it looks and it fits me great! I definitely recommend it. Great price, too!
B00RWWX81W|3|Love the colour but not enough support for breasts, and too gapey when bend over ie. Doing yoga!
B008G3N776|5|I got this shirt about a month or two ago and the design still looks as good as new! I recommend this shirt!
B00GFAKCM0|5|I bought this dress for my daughter who is a flower girl in my best friends wedding! It got here quickly and is a very beautiful dress. I ordered a size up because reviews said it was made smaller, my daughter usually wears a 7-8 but the 9-10 fits her perfectly.
B008459F72|5|I pin these on the collar of my felt jackets to let everyone know my job while on active duty in the Navy.  The device is of high quality.  This is the symbol for helium, chemical element atomic number 2.  And it is the rating insignia for a US Navy Electronics Technician (ET).  My rating patch in the Navy was of interest to a nun while I stood in St. Peter's square at the vatican.  The nun asked me what the symbol meant and I said it stood for my speciality of electronics.  She smiled and said it was used in her books to represent all thing atomic.
B00CI4921E|2|One of the slippers came with a big yellow stain on it, visible though the packaging.
B00DJQIKZ4|5|love it
B002Z2FXT4|5|good product got here fast love it
B001873EH0|4|Very nice quality shirt. I thought it ran a little bit small though. I would have given it 5 stars if it were a little big larger.
B007FLGEW0|4|Nice and thin
B0079MI428|5|everything we wanted and more.. the best ever..
B00Q490KG0|5|GREAT FIT COMFORTABLE AND WARM
B00MIU97UO|5|I ordered a medium for my hubby, and when I first received it I thought it appeared to be quite large, however, when I had him try it on it fit perfectly! The material is soft and the sweater is well made. He and I are were quite content with this product. I would definitely recommend!
B00IQINVQS|5|Cute light shirt. I ordered the XL and maybe could have ordered a Large but I like it either way
B00BEB4TFG|4|i bought this cap for my 11 year old son who is a Minecraft fanatic.  The cap is really nicely made and wears well.  He absolutely loves the hat.  Great gift for any kid (or adult?) who's into Minecraft.
B001BAPGWU|2|I typically order a medium to fit snuggly but not super tight. I ordered a size bigger because of previous reviews. The center part of the shirt is tight and the sleeves are extra long and loose. The material is thin and see-through if you get the lighter colors. Does work nicely as an undershirt.
B001OR6CMI|5|Bought these for my husband who cannot go out without shading his face as we live in Arizona.  He needs lots and being white they go with everything.
B008BEGG6E|4|The gloves were warm enough when I tried them although they fit a bit too snugly on my hand. It's supposed to be a one size fits all glove but I doubt it could have stretched much further and I have regular sized hands.
B00VYVW5NY|5|Pictures do not do this dress justice. Perfect fit. Lovely print
B003ILK6BG|1|It would be better to get a pack of colored t-shirts at Walmart in a size too large and take them in at the side.  I was not expecting much for the price, but this just screams cheap.  I only wear it for layering other items on top.  Will not purchase again from American Apparel.
B00IX0917C|5|Beautiful bathing suit! Very simple but still sexy! Love it!!!!!
B00JM286SA|5|Great material, fits beautifully.
B00HD7VV1A|5|Cool little girl socks
B00EOVHOW8|1|Color runs terribly on the first wash just by running water!! The turquoise dye continues to drip while hanging dry. And the end result? Vest color became uneven! Unbelievable...Can't imagine this is worn over a white T during rainy day.
B00LMI9A6Y|5|These leggings are amazing. Super soft and so comfortable, honestly the only problem I had is when I wore them to work with my sweater dress; I kept wanting to curl up and go to sleep because I was so cozy. Seriously amazing product, great quality and unbeatable price. I wash them on a delicate cycle in cold water and dry them on low and they hold up very well.
B007P0GB10|4|So I have 34/36 that fit great and figured I'd order some more. Well, a year or so later the newer version is like an inch longer. Do I hear 34/35?
B008VS8R30|3|Looks great, I got lots of compliments when I wore it out. After 1 washing though, where the studs are on the top has sort of &#34;bunched&#34; together. The material is thin and overall, it doesn't seem like this top will last for more than several wearings/washings.
B007Q2W1X4|5|I have a terrible time with socks, as I have sensitive skin, and most bands really bother me, and make me itch.  Therese are easy to wear, and I hope to buy more..
B00FGCKJ4O|4|I really like the color and the fit. I have a curvy body type and it hugs is all the right places without revealing too much. The fabric is pretty thin so the correct undies are needed ;-) But the thin material will be perfect for summer!!
B00BBU5WMY|5|I have 2 pairs of these and they fit a 61-year shape really well!  Look great with flats or a wedge heel.  Nice color of denim.  Stand up well to washings.  I hang dry them just to make them last longer.
B00IGVC9OA|5|LOVED IT! Was a hit at the Saratoga Race track :) Thank you!
B00F4O2H30|5|I'd been wanting to buy a robe for months, but never pulled the trigger on any of them bc all the good ones seemed to be $60+. After reading the reviews on this Dearfoams robe, I decided to try it (price was right!)- I am so glad I did. I could not imagine a better robe. SO so soft without feeling too artificial. It is lined with the same soft fabric throughout (unlike cheaper robes that are just soft on the outside), it has functional pockets, and the tie is attached appropriately. Furthermore, it is reasonably flattering considering the thickness of the robe. If you are wondering about sizing, I am normally a size S in tops, size 27 pants and ordered a small... I probably could have gone with a medium but the small is fine.
B0096EERK0|5|In the past year I have bought approx. 5 pairs of shoes for work. I went from high end clogs, to running shoes to ortho shoes. NOTHING worked liked these clogs. I stand on my feet for 10 hours a day wearing a lead apron and my feet don't hurt. FINALLY a pair of shoes I look forward to wearing. Now, I will say if you work a job like I do wear support hose or knee highs it will help make the world a better place.
B001TD7RMG|4|I used this tiara for a halloween costume. It's not very durable, but for the price I paid, it was totally worth it!
B00EK93XYW|5|This tunic is super cute. I'm wearing it now for thanksgiving. It's a little big. I wear a medium and a size 8/10. If you want it a little more oversized, get your size but if you want it to fit better, size down.
B007L3XV5K|5|Looks great, quality good, I love a stretch belt for jeans, always comfortable.  There is not much more to say, it is a nice causal clothes belt.
B00FBO0KZU|5|Nice comfortable cap. Just a little snug.
B00FW41NFU|4|Super cute but runs a bit small!
B0084YJT7O|5|I really love this! It makes my costume look great, as it accents it and matches it perfectly. It prevents me from having to carry a purse around with just my phone in it all day for Halloween. Much props.
B008KCKA50|5|What can I say. A great looking product at a reasonable price with a good fit. Truth be told I have been looking for a bomber jacket when I happen on a store in the malls that carry this product but never have been satisfied with the offerings - and the price - wow, off the charts. Now I am circumspect about purchasing clothing on-line -you know, clothing is personal- but what the &#34;heck&#34; I gave this a try and bingo. I have even given this bomber jacket a honored position in my closet ahead of two other leather (dress) jackets. Unlike my dress jackets there is room to move and yet it has a real masculine fit - nice. Sometime the fates shine.
B00FFV7RUA|5|Makes me feel pretty sexy going to bed. Really soft material, adjustable straps. The man ain't complainin' either. I'd buy from Honey Dew again.
B00KAT24SW|5|I like teaming up blazers with my shirts and t-shirts. I had been looking for some different colors, a bit of a change from the usual. So when I came through this blazer and absolutely liked it. Therefore, I ordered the pink blazer in XL size for me. The size fits me well and the fabric is good. The blazer is comfortable and doesn’t make me feel uneasy. The cut and stitch is perfect. The design is very cool, a perfect party blazer. Apart from the look, design and quality, the price of the jacket is within affordable range.
B00AKBXR9A|5|These fit me well (size 6 shoe), whereas most socks run a bit large.  They are long-lasting with typical care and frequent wear, with no fading.  The elastic at the top looks a bit odd, and I would not wear them with an outfit where they were visible.  Apart from that, the socks are a great value!
B00D3D3ID2|1|I bought L as usually but this think make me look like a sasquash in the wood....!!!
B00CWXHJEI|5|Very nice shirt.  My new favorite; helps keep me cool in summer in Texas.
B00BCOXZ9Q|5|Loved it!  So many compliments
B00AXURMYO|5|I am very old fashion and was desperate to find what they call old ladies' panties - they fit perfectly and comfortably-no riding and no WEDGES--
B00DW3SHR0|5|My 4yo son is the size of a 6 year old in build and height.  This coat fit well.  With that I'd say it runs true to size.  I like the length in the sleeves (because he has long arms).  I wish the body was just a tad longer but its not a deal breaker.  He loves it and calls it his &#34;hunting coat&#34;. :)
B000144OHU|5|I honestly love this product. When I can't, or don't want, to wear a bra these are great! Comfortable and nearly undetectable. :)
B00EFD1UIO|4|I wish these shorts had elastic or something else in the waist.  My son is long and lean so the length is perfect but the strings just don't get tight enough on these.  I'm hoping that he puts a little weight on so that these don't keep falling down, he often wears underwear underneath to keep them up.  The fabric is nice quality and the colors are great.  My only issue is the waist.
B00K22892M|5|It feelsso good on, especially on the hot summer heat.
B00GY0YUI8|1|These pants were just terrible. They are too big, they are baggy in some areas, and they don't stay up. I am very disappointed in this purchase.
B0013XWDGC|4|Just around my back nod only by a little
B0006PL9AY|5|I had a Army surplus store years ago. These are the best, Warmest socks I ever sold. Glad I found them again.
B001K3F0KQ|3|Everything was excellent price and product time so I'm very grateful and just keep using your excellent service. The only problem is that I ordered arrived only three shirts and two, do not know if the problem was in my country or sent me only 2<br />thank you very much
B00DZBDS4Q|5|I go this for an upcoming cruise, though I expect to get a lot of wear out of it.  It is flattering and comfortable.  I wear a 14 and the Large fit just fine.  Armholes are appropriately sized and the front does not scoop as low on me as it does on the model (I'm a 36 D chest and have no modesty issues).  Highly recommend.
B006B44I3O|5|They bow came untied on the panties. Its not a normal bow i can just tie back. It was sewn into place. The material is so soft and beautiful
B00BJPJWD6|5|Little small but we'll designed
B002GHC3ZA|5|good! fit good!
B008FK8B3A|4|It was my mistake I was looking for kids not youth but we love fox so it's staying in the family.
B0094GB6LS|4|This shirt looks like the picture and fits great. I am 5'2'' and 120 and the shirt is really cute.
B003JO2KF2|5|Tight sweater fit, but overall good costume for a kids party
B004QF0TFQ|5|Very happy with my purchase
B00DN1BXVS|5|If I would have not checked other reviews, I would have ordered the wrong size I would have ordered large instead of medium..on the reviews the major complaint was if your a large ...don't order a large because it will be to big... order a medium which I did....there needs to be a size chart for this chef coat, so a person can order the right size since the chef coat seems to be one size larger then the size your ordering ....My body size is 180 lbs  5' 8&#34;.. neck 151/2&#34; .. a medium fits perfect.....not large...I looked on line for a chef coat similar to this coat size chart  and it showed the neck size is in the range of 151/2 &#34; for a medium... that what I ordered ....It fits perfect..Good luck......
B00ABNEQGK|5|Love it. Kinda snug.
B00BL9Q710|4|Nice
B00NQFHAF4|5|fits perfect.. I ordered the mustard one.. I am 5'4 170 lbs.. so I got the large and it hugs my curves perfectly.. I'm so happy with this dress.. can't wait to wear it in the spring time
B006IMRJCG|5|Great wallet!  Easy money clip inside the wallet makes getting the cash quick.  Very thin as well.
B00ADXCDR2|5|Like it very much.. The color, the fabric and style are what I want...beautiful !
B00GDEN1QW|4|Only four stars because I haven't actually worn or washed it yet - but so far very happy with my purchase. Higher quality than I was expecting for the price, fits well (very glad I got an XL though, as I usually wear a L but didn't want it to be small), looks great. Nice long sleeves that are actually big enough for my arms and shoulders without having strange armpits due to the larger size (I have broad shoulders and large upper arms so often have a hard time with button up shirts fitting right).<br /><br />Note: This isn't a heavy flannel, but a good lighter weight flannel (between light and medium I'd say). Good for fall or mild winters, or for layering.<br /><br />A few cons:<br />Is a little snug in the chest and hip area, if I'd have gotten the large instead of the XL it wouldn't have fit. I might have preferred it a little longer, but I have a longer torso than most women so not something I really mind.<br /><br />Will probably end up ordering another one if I find another color I like, after I wash and dry it to see how it might shrink/wear. (Hoping it doesn't shrink much but don't want to go through the process of having to remember yet another shirt I can't put in the dryer.)
B004WFXRUE|5|item just perfect, my baby is looking so cute with it. I could buy again from the provider. great deal
B002ZIZMZS|3|Runs really small.
B002ZJDCRC|3|Had a previous Tote umbrella that was better as it was vented to shed wind.  Was hoping this was a replacement but was disappointed to see no vent.  Bought for use at grandson's football games.  Adequate but not near as good as the one I lost.
B00BXT56P6|5|Very warm. Just be aware that everyone will assume you're military.
B002ZMOZAC|1|This product is great, but buy it from someone other than Amazon.  Customer service is terrible and refuses to provide any help whatsoever if anything goes wrong.  You are MUCH better off paying a little more and buying from a retailer you can trust.
B00DEYNJM0|5|Great fabric, fit, color and price!
B00CKY4EJM|4|The ribbon does not need to.<br />It is thin and cool clothes.<br />Waist size is adjustable.<br />I want a more relaxed pants width
B00UV6N94M|5|I loveeee it!!!! it fits perfect....i you have small breast so the top does not move as much but if you have bigg breast i wouldn't advise you to get this item..... its coming from china so order it with time, even thou it said I was going to get it in a month It came pretty quick. it got to my house in less then 2 in a half weeks
B00ECHNFEK|5|Fit is good colors are good very comfy i actually would like the fit to be a little tighter but that's just me
B00719WZ7Y|5|Compfy lounge shorts.  Just for relaxing, not for town.
B00D4KDR6W|4|Very cute!
B0052WBRV2|5|Item is made in Mexico. I loved the garment. Color is better than what I thought I was buying. A better color than this is 12 months green.<br />I always prefer Mexico, Poland and Turkey produced Levi's products. I believe seller shoul mention this on item description.
B000VJ5GE0|5|These legging are awesome!  The higher waistband definitely keeps you from having any spillover.  My new favorites. Worth every penny!
B00OPX38ES|4|Awesome shirt though. Bought it for my bf for Xmas and it was way too small but it fits me perfect and I get a ton of compliments! Love it!
B009WB984M|4|This nursing bra isn't likely to become your daily staple, but it is decent enough to add some color and variety into the rotation. The cups are definitely a demi, so don't expect full coverage. I think some nursing moms would be playing peek-a-boo with the top even in their correct size, so it  wouldn't work for everyone. The cups are also fairly wide set which is visible in the picture, so this bra won't work under most tank tops because it would be visible under the arms. The straps are a little wider than I would prefer, but not awful. The fold down for nursing works well, but because of the padding doesn't lay as flat as some less padded options.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this bra to someone looking for a sexy option in their nursing bra collection, but I will continue to wear a more comfortable, less sexy bra as my regular. I would buy this same cut in other colors if it was available, because it is nice to still feel sexy when nursing.
B00JS7IFCQ|5|Loooooovvvve this hat I always get compliments not matter what, super cute on girls
B004XG21B8|3|okay
B008FR0ZFK|5|With a one size upgrade, its fits nice. An interesting design.  You may not have ever thought about it but most underwear has some form of elasticized rear end. This backside bottom just &#34;flaps in the wind.&#34;  Therefore, your butt cheeks kinda just hang out.  You will either love or hate that feature according to how big an ass you are. (Sorry). For me, I like it.
B00LMR0YA6|3|Everything fits about except the top is very loose. I need to pull it down to make it not bunch up in the front. Either my top half is too short or my boobs are too small. Overall, nice dress, needs to be alter slightly.
B007IKQQYY|1|always stealing photos are placed and prducto works or not is not the same as you order, are stealing  ya
B0016LDT32|5|I bought this for my daughter.  The length is good for school, the color is right, and the fit is slim without being too fitted.  She has worn this many times since we bought it, which is the best review!
B00DJ7MX9M|5|Perfect for her Halloween costume.
B009FV85YI|3|Somewhat thinner fabric than I expected.  The only complaint I have is the length of time it took to 'receive it.
B00DHPVEYG|5|It is very nice,  stylish and good quality coat. A slightly small, but it's OK (Because my daughter bit  thin). I think that We will spend winter in warm and Comfortably. My daughter like it very  much!
B00J5RGMK6|5|These dresses are very flattering for young girls.  Love the way it fits my 10 year old daughter.  I got her a size 14 so she will be able to wear it for a loonngg time!! And that makes it worth the money.  I buy a lot of flared dresses for my daughter and I always buy a size up because you can tie the back to adjust the fit. You can wear these dresses as shirts with jeans and leggings also when the girls outgrow them.  I hate getting rid of cute dresses and my daughter currently wears a size 8/10. I still have size 6 dresses similar to this style that she still likes to wear :-) What I like most about this dress is the different materials used throughout the color blocks.  Feels very durable and not cheaply made at all.  The colors are vibrant and very bright for spring.  The dress I can tell will be easy to wash and take care of.  I would definately recommend the brand and the seller.  Shipped very fast and in a convenient package that fit in my mailbox.  This is my first time ordering dresses for my daughter on Amazon and I am very pleased with my experience. I have purchased dresses for me from known name brands, and I'm hesitant on buying clothing brands I'm not familiar with.  With that said, I will be looking more from this particular brand in the future.  Ok, now go ahead and add it to your cart!!
B005LXFINA|5|The print is great quality and hasn't pealed at all since I got it. I get lots of compliments when I wear it and it's absolutely my favorite top right now. The signature on the side looks really great too!
B007KFZEOA|5|I think I underestimated my width!!  The cup size was spot on. I wore it and loved the support. I will definitely order another in a wider size. I wore it all day without feeling &#34;smushed&#34;!!
B00EPFH6W6|4|Arrived quickly and packaging was good. A little snug/seems to run a little small. Soft material, well made and has vibrant colors.
B00DXNHPCW|4|I wear a 36x32, and had to go with the 38 for a normal size. I have a few other dockers, but the iron free seem a bit tighter cut.
B00411AZU4|5|the flapper costume is good,,it fits a bit large but looks good anyways
B001M41X90|5|The nicest track suit I have ever bought.
B00AAMF6Z2|4|I really like this outfit set. It's really great for soccer or any other work out at gym. I bought this set for my son. He loves it. He wears it to Crossfit kids. He looks really adorable in it.
B00F1PD85I|5|Perfect fit, awesome quality for the price.
B00Q8CK8JC|5|Love it if only they carried more colors and character of pokemon
B00G3AMZWW|5|I'm going to venture into TMI territory here, but with bras you really need to know what the reviewer is shaped like to be able to tell if the bra will fit you too. I'm a 34G, full on top, very close-set. Basically, non-plunge underwires don't ever sit flat at the center gore, because there's just not enough room for the wires in between (without a bra, I've only got about 1/4 inch between my breasts at the narrowest point). I also frequently run into problems where the top outer edges near the straps gap and then the top line near the center is too small. This bra solved all of those problems. Gore sits flush, the top line fits correctly, and no/minimal corner gapping.<br /><br />The only flaws I find so far, after wearing it several times:<br />The material is a thin mesh, so isn't particularly supportive in itself. I'm ok with that - I like that it gives the cups a bit more flexibility to adjust to size/shape shifts throughout the day or month - but if you like a firmer cup, this isn't one. This also goes for the straps - they're pretty stretchy. I haven't found it to be a problem as I like stretchy straps as well (shoulder pain), but I know lots of people don't.<br />I also wish it came in a more neutral color scheme rather than the high-contrast dark embroidery/light base design. It's very pretty, but it makes the bra a bit less versatile in terms of what you can wear it under. This seems pretty usual for the Curvy Kate line, from what I can tell - I also bought a &#34;Daily Boost&#34; smooth cup, and even the beige/tan/white-girl-nude colorway had bright white contrast trim. I guess that's just their thing?<br /><br />All in all, this bra was an excellent choice for my fit needs and price point. Once I can confirm how well it holds up over more wears and washes, I'll probably buy another one. If there's anything else I can tell you about it, just ask - us special-order-sized people gotta help each other out :)
B00IGA5402|2|I have loved Carter's sleepers for my little girl from Newborn size to 9 month size… However, once the sleepers get into 12 month and up they become &#34;snug fit&#34; which means super tight. My 4 month old is literally off the charts for her height and weight. She is bigger than most 7 month olds. These sleepers are long enough, but way too tight fitting.<br /><br />As for the material, design, and quality: they were all Carter's usual excellence. I just wish they were made for chubby babies, too.
B00L4A0VXG|5|Perfect
B00IZHF9VK|5|This coat is amazing I'm going to order some more like the one I just received I wish there was a all white one
B00R28XZCS|5|OMG I just love this outfit. Great quality! Carters never disappoint me. The colors are beautiful, just like the picture.
B00H96DYUG|5|Top quality and comfort at competitive pricing
B0018QS5CK|5|These jeans look great, have full denim weight of Levi's and fit much better In the thighes and rear than the relaxed one's so often sold everywhere.<br />Besides 501's these are a favorite Levi's<br />The Stonewashed Is a good color. Goes with my Jean Jacket.
B003VVR4DG|5|Great buy
B0047E44AM|5|Nice quality and match the raincoat.
B003ID31KW|3|There are pretty and the pattern is nice, but it's not as dark as in the picture and they fade kind of quickly.
B00DDXO1JC|4|As expected, haven't found the perfect place to wear this. A little on the sexy side. But its lined to mid thigh. And I need to get some spanx as the white part on the dress that hugs your one hip can be a little unforgiving...but I love this dress!
B002XV45BE|4|Love this bra but it is not very supportive. Once my milk would let down the bra would kind of let up and droop. But otherwise it is a great bra to sleep in but not an all day wear.
B000JEYLA2|3|They go higher up the leg than expected .
B00FBNOSWC|5|I love them
B002EI07U4|5|Comfortable, soft, pretty.  No panty lines.  Love the thick waist hem!
B00FPKO47U|5|These are great for the mature man, it's not skin tight. Fits like a tee shirt and true to size. Great price too!
B00F2T53RE|5|sister love them
B00A7T9KFA|5|Love the fit and make!!
B00KIE1BZG|2|Providing you don't need to lose a lot, this might work. On the other hand, if you are carrying a small bowling ball around your midsection, don't expect much other than a really tight tank top. Diet and exercise...there is no substitute. A terrible ides for weight loss.
B00H1S7LCY|4|It works as a strapless bra, stay pretty good. But the padding at the bottom make your breasts looked a little bit unnatural. Like a little bump, if you know I mean. Overall, it works but will not buy again.
B00E38GRKM|3|I purchased these during a lightning sale.  They were still pricey at $89 for the set.  For almost $30 each, I was expecting a little more. The tag in back is so scratchy, even after washing, that I'm going to have to remove it.  There goes the Cosabella name.  I may as well be wearing Walmart lol.  On me the straps are positioned very wide causing the straps to slip down.  I'm not that huge chested (36C) and find the large to be a bit skimpy.  There's no support, but I wasn't expecting that.  These were purchased for lounging, but it's really not as comfortable as I expected.
B00IZCSGP6|5|Like the fit, plus I get lots of compliments.
B00S8SL5LY|4|First off, let me start by saying this is NOT a thick cold-weather sweatshirt. I had hoped it was, but after getting it today and wearing it about, its very soft inside, breathable and going to be great for spring/fall and cool summer nights. The zipper is a bit small and may be problematic in the future but no evidence this early. Also, no logo on the back which was disappointing. If not for my love of Deadpool, I wouldnt think this worth 60$, but its not a bad shirt by any means.
B00LOV0SCY|5|So pretty that I did not want to return it. Instead I gave it as a gift!
B00D2D5A16|5|Fits perfectly, great material, true to size and a lovely design. Arrived on time very happy with mu purchase and I would definitely recommend this dress.
B000GRM2PI|4|These gloves are great.  I gave only four stars because they are very small.  I don't think many seven year olds out there could wear these.  My daughter is a petite five and they just fit her, maybe even a bit small.  At least she can get her hands in there and she enjoys wearing them.  I'm glad they aren't loose, I just don't think they are for anyone much older than five, and a small five at that.  I know three year olds that could wear them well.
B0012FAC3M|5|My granddaughter is going to look like the flavors of saltwater taffy in this dress.  The fabric is soft, the decoration well applied and the colors are cheerful.  I especially love the flower shaped buttons from neck to hem.
B000ZE9NLS|5|I love this hoodie soooo many compliments. Its got a tiiiight embrodiering and design inside the hood which i think that makes it even tighter
B00MV2IMJQ|5|Fast delivery product very nice.
B00EAYTVX4|5|I've also tried the Beefy T's and quite like them, but, having bought one of these, it supplants them as my favored undershirt.  The fabric is very thick, even more so than the Beefy T's, and the fit is similar.  I like a close fit for undershirts and so tend to tear something flimsy, being 6-1 and a solid 310 pounds.  This should hold up well.  In fact it's so heavy that some might actually find it less comfortable than something thinner, but I look forward to a good long wearing life before it ends up in the rag-bag.  I suggest generous use of fabric softener.
B002X0NZ9I|2|Cheaply made poor quality material, I was not very amused by the overall quality og the shirt, I expected more.  The collar was weak, and the material is stiff and thin, I guess you do get what you pay for.  I would recomend shopping more.
B00AIY3MHG|4|This money clip is perfect. It's slim, inexpensive, and holds everything I need it to. I have 3 seldom used credit cards, and some cash in it and it's wonderful.
B0085VOG8S|5|It's adorable and sexy and exactly what I was looking for.
B00EA4624A|5|expresses my thoughts exactly, I'm just passin' through for a short while, but hope I've made a difference...I remember a version that had a very hip fella with bellbottoms and wafflestompers on in the '70's, wish I could find it.
B00KHJQCO2|5|Fit fine and get the job done when wearing a pair of boat shoes i bought recently
B00K76952G|1|Worried about this product shrinking and not fitting
B004U43FUO|4|Beautiful blue color. The only slight problem is the length. It's too long, hoping it will shrink slightly in the dryer.
B0010EI8G8|4|This fits well and is every nice. I would recommend to anyone. Style is very nice and seems to be appealing.
B008P7ZCK8|5|Love it get tons of compliments every time I wear it! Paired w/a chunky necklace and belt best purchase ever!
B00CU8CJIG|5|This is a Gorgeous dress! I love the lace! It fit my 2 year old daughter perfect! Perfect Christmas dress!
B00UWDUIAW|4|Nice cut, fits as expected good quality
B00BS2FG30|5|Nice color combination and fit great.
B00K8MOJR0|5|I will be wearing this to Colorado Country Jams.
B00P0DQ0EW|3|I like it it fits perfect
B00A13MWPM|3|excellent
B00GUCTQ7A|4|A cute summer dress. In the winter we spin the belt around and pair it with a sweater.
B00NGBXFNY|5|Best fitting nursing bra I've found, it was slightly uncomfortable for the first few days of wear but now it is perfect. If you have a larger bust and small band size I would highly recommend this bra.
B00011PQJI|2|Very nice cut. But the pants is the only nice thing here. The information page for their web site is vague, especially about shipping times, all the delays that one WILL encounter. It's a nice product and fit well, but you may as well wait forever to get it.
B00MZ5BMNC|5|These are a great addition to my winter layering.  The fit is perfect for me at 5.5 in the size small. The fabric is rayon and spandex - a great combo.  Wish Cuddle Duds made more items with this fabric.  I now have 3 pairs and think I will use them as lounge wear in the summer.  Very comfortable, light weight and silky.
B00QGOCHTQ|3|wrong color matching for a dress,
B000BI24DC|5|Excelent!!
B00PIPS9AK|5|It's a very good t shirt!
B00219PPQC|5|I had already purchased this brand bra at a local shop, so I knew my size. I found this one online at amazon and it was $30. cheaper than the speciality store.
B008ELO21A|5|Perfect pants for the summer and for lounging around.  The style is really nice though I wish there was another pocket on the other leg as well.  The material is really good and found no problems with the seams.  The price is really good but expect to wait for your order.  I plan on ordering more in the near future
B00LPCZ61K|1|Very disappointed :-(
B008KIVF1C|5|Hudson Jeans are worth the $ great fit & show your shape :)
B002GCDY08|5|Was hard to find irish green until I found this produce. Fit is very good, color was just as stated and quality was very good. I will order from them again.
B0002TP1D0|4|Good product, same quality as past order.
B00NLMZ2HA|4|The FlipsSide was as described, but when looking at it closely it does seem a bit unpolished in construction given the price for the item. The open latch is a bit hard to open one handed and the jury is out on the longevity of the spring. This product should be priced in its current configuration at least $10 cheaper.
B00M27Z7JI|4|Super comfy.  But pills fairly easily.
B008BT9AEO|4|Narrower than I thought. But Nice Product.
B006U7VZNI|5|It does its job.
B00AVOUMUI|5|This wig went through a lot the night I wore it. I held up well and did not shed that much. Very impressive product!
B00M13O4W4|3|It just did not look good on me
B00KRC2LGC|3|Nice.. I bought a larger size and its still a bit snug..
B008HSESQ4|2|The gloves were extremely loose and the length going down the arm is nowhere as long as it is pictured.  It actually rests just at the wrists.
B00JTQ7KY0|5|Gave this to my cousin for her birthday as an inside joke. She loved it!
B00D5V0ZWE|5|It was just what I needed for my fire phone and my new purse.
B00LJNXPC2|2|To small, but this is my size very disappointed, this is for a Middle school littler girl
B0088L8ZIM|2|It's an OK t-shirt. Not the color I expected. I asked for Khaki and received some kind of marl grey/green color.
B004OYS1ZE|4|belt is very nice seems durable, like the fact that it's 1.5 inch wide in lieu of 1&#34; like most belts.  The only drawback is only has 7 holes which wasn't really clear on write up.
B006SFSJCM|5|soft and comfy and warm.
B007LUV358|5|Crazy Dog T-shirts are awesome! After buying a couple to see how they'd fit, I'm now going to order quite a few more!
B00CIA3R14|5|Worth the money
B00OGU8LS8|5|I love it!!!  Can't wait to wear it.
B00LXN6L88|4|cute and love it
B00J13BSYO|5|would never buy another brand of bathing suit top. Love it
B00UEOBT3E|3|Other models same brand with better quality and fit.
B003HC8S8E|5|Great socks and very comfortable.
B00CL0OJ0O|5|Very nice hat, purchased it for yard work.
B00CWKD21K|5|Every time I wear these shorts I get compliments. Super cute and has a great fit! Not to tight and not too loose!
B00S31HH5E|3|Cute but not what I needed.
B006YEUC86|5|the designs were unique and suited for almost any outfit. they looked good in style and the price was very reasonable for a bundle at a time.
B00FU6QRPG|5|Runs very big, but babies do grow! Seasonal but also nice for anytime, the quality of the material is very good and the designs are detailed and simple but sweet. Piping around shirt is thick and high quality. Organic material has a noticeable difference. Would recommend.
B004I5NZTG|5|Carhartt washed twill dungarees will be my choice from now on. material is not as heavy as blue jean so they are cooler in the summer time. great fit not to loose and not to tight. the pocket on the right is perfect for cell phone.
B00D6BZA78|4|I like them, fit as spected
B000PIBZE2|4|They get the job done.  If you want real quality, go to Hanna Andersson and get the organic cotton boxer briefs.  But if you just need some utility briefs, these work.
B00EYWRDLO|1|Don't  waste your money! ! Cheap material rips easy fits awful hated it I wish I can get my money back cause I never can wear it
B005O7MXMC|5|Beautiful, soft. Sizes run really small!!!!  My daughter wears an 8. I had to return this item for a size 10.
B0011EB5P8|5|I love this bra!! I know that sounds bizarre for someone talking about a bra, but this bra is just fantastic!! I had gone without a bra for a long while and needed to wear one badly. I have arthritis in my shoulders and I was searching for a bra that I could wear that would close easily in the front. Past experiences with frontal closures were awful...they always popped open and were generally binding and uncomfortable. I was also getting tired of pulling up my bra straps all day. Well this Vanity Fair bra fixed every problem I was having!!! This bra is so smooth and comfortable that I can wear it all day long and it never feels binding or uncomfortable. The bra is easy to put on, no tugging around my shoulders with all the pain that went with that from other bras. it is smooth and light weight and is just GREAT!!! I am back purchasing more of them because I am afraid they may discontinue them so I want to stock up. You cannot go wrong with this one!!!
B004O3LULW|5|Very good product and the price was very reasonable. Looks and feels well made and fit is adjustable. Very glad I bought this hat.
B005OUZ79K|5|Exactly the quality I would expect and the size was a winner as well!!!  My son is 6'4  and athletic so finding jeans that fit well...... this was my fourth attempt.
B00NLAK4YI|4|Reasonably well made. Just what I expected
B002DU6DVU|5|Awesome leather laptop bag. I'm still, even after years, using it for my macbook. Leather still looks great. Awesome value!
B004OUXH20|5|Wife was surprised when she recieved it, but just thought the skirt was cute. Immediately put it on and was just wearing it all night.
B0046MFR8S|3|I got the delivery with the Amazon Prime delivery really fast and it was great! However, after wearing them, I loved the way they felt and they felt like nothing was on. Then after I washed them a few times, they literally shrunk a size down and the elastic part got stuck to my skin during one of the long days i had and it felt very uncomfortable. The other problem is that since it is Satin, the fabric is not that breathable so wearing them in the summer may not be a good idea if you're using to wearing cotton boxers all your life. If you decide to buy these boxers, just make sure to order one size bigger because they will shrink!
B00IX5NMFE|5|very sweet on and not large seams to bother my lo
B00BGRJFOS|5|very good product
B007PJOE24|5|High quality hat from a very reputable hat maker.  Was so glad to see some of their products offered on amazon.  I've purchased other Goorin hats and will continue to do so.
B000SKLTI4|3|Thin
B004SWJ3S6|2|I had to send the jacket back because my grandson said that it is not heavy enough for him. the jacket it self was fine<br />But he like it to be just a little bit heaver.<br /><br />  Mrs. Mary McAllister
B00LL6QE7U|5|Funny smell, nothing bad, some clothes smell that way till it's washed. Fit as expected. Of couse, you already know to order a size or two larger as it is not the same fitting with US sizes. If you follow the rules, you won't be disappointed. I am not!
B00CQ20EU6|5|great shirt
B00CNKP9EW|5|Perfect for my truck loving toddler. This jammies are adorable and warm enough. Nice quality fabric, the stitching on the dump truck  looks great, not going to unravel after a few washes. Can't wait to order more from this brand. Thanks!
B00004W437|4|Although the box was big and heavy once it was opened it was ready to use, absolutely no assembly required, this was a huge plus for me.
B000LO73PA|5|Fit was perfect, very comfortable, well made and long lasting.  Hate to give them up even when they finally get a small hole after wearing them forever.
B00QDEVJU2|4|Keeps me warm :)
B00F2OONZW|5|I got the package about 2 days after I ordered it. I was SOO excited opening the package! The material was so soft and when putting it on, nothing came off of it (buttons) so that's a good sign! I am 5'5&#34; an weigh about 140lb and it fits pretty good, I have room to move around it and if I grow anymore, I could still wear it! Another thing; I love the pockets! I wore it to a comic con in my city and I could store my phone and other things in there that I got from the comic con, everyone loved the outfit! The stitching is really good. The only problem I had with it was the nose was a bit misplaced. But it is an amazing kigurumi nonetheless! It definitely deserves 5 stars for the price, shipping, and quality.
B002ZLOP58|5|Very adorable little shirt.  The shirti s quite long which worked well as my niece I purchaed it for is very long in the body.
B00TINH2TC|5|GREAT DRESS FOR THE MONEY!  Excellent for weddings, wine tastings, etc.
B00PQ60DVO|1|Nothing like the picture and doesn't come close to fitting.
B0016LDMIO|4|Came before it was due, was a bit to long though had to get it hem. but I love it.
B006GA0F9Y|4|Let me clarify by saying that I'm a big girl: size 22/24, 42DDD, crazy hourglass shape.<br />I have been a long-time user of what most people now deem \\"retro\\" shapewear. Heavy duty, industrial strength, rib cracking girdles.<br /><br />But...there are times, like say when it's 95 out and you just can't bear the idea of an extra layer of iron underneath your skirt and blouse. I like a little something to smooth out my lumps and to act as a slip for lighter weight clothing. So I ordered this in a XXL.<br /><br />I fully expected to put this on and let it \\"bra\\" portion ride low underneath my underwire-from-hell getup. But, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I could pull this on (step into it, ladies. do not try to go over your head) and up and OVER my bra without it squishing my chest flat. At all! It diffused the usual lace imprint that my bra leaves through a white blouse which was nice. Now...because it didn't flatten my chest, you can imagine it didn't smooth out much of my other lumps, either.<br /><br />What it did do was give me full coverage from chest to mid-thigh with light compression. It was comfortable (honestly forgot I had it on), did not roll up while sitting, standing or walking, and kept a layer between sweaty me and my thin rayon skirt.<br /><br />It's slightly heavier than a good pair of tights and while I wouldn't count on it slimming you down much, it is a nice alternative to something between a traditional slip and grama's bullet proof waist cincher.
B00ENLN978|4|Its great, exactly what I was looking for. Nothing special, but also exactly what I wanted. I comfy robe for a little warmth in a chilly morning.  I did used to have a robe I liked more, the only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars
B007CTSGNK|3|This shirt had a cute design but was too small for my daughter and had no stretch to it, so we ended up sending it back without ordering another one.
B001HYO6VW|1|Very dissapointed with the poor quality of this tee!! The print doesn't look like the one on the picture.  It looks like something a school kid would do for his art project.  For the price I would expect something much much better!!!
B00ACIFZ3W|3|It is a slim fit, not the regular size
B00BJN6ELG|3|I found them to stretch out and lose their shape a bit after an hour or so of wearing them. I also had to keep pulling them up, and pulling the fabric around the calves down. I ordered the large, and I usually wear a 12, so I sized correctly, they definitely weren't too big. Disappointed.
B00K8U69HA|5|Used this as my son's first Halloween costume.  Really cute and functional as an everyday outfit long after.
B00HAXTSHQ|5|CUTE
B000GW67U4|5|Sewed this onto my leather welding sleeves. Looks pretty bad ass. 25th Alaska!
B002JIO318|5|Quality leather in a nice design that optimizes the number of credit cards, ID's, and insurance cards that will fit in this amount of space.  It will fit in a front or rear pocket of jeans or men's dress pants.  Room is available for folding money and two pockets for a few business cards if you wish, after you put in the basic 13 ID and credit cards.  I like to carry a large wallet about 3 1/2 by 4 1/2 inches, but not one of the larger carriers 7 to 8 inches tall.  This one also allows you to carry a few small photos, but I remove the photo filler.  Full use is made of the space.
B0083H3QSA|5|good
B0007V9TYU|5|So stoked when I opened this! Looks fresh and clean on any outfit.
B006B5VX0O|5|The fit is perfect, we will order this size again<br />We also like the fabric and the cut of the jeans
B00OZ8MCOA|3|THE COLOR IN THIS PHOTO IS NOT THE SAME AS THE WHAT WE EXPECTED.  NEXT TIME SHOULD POST THE CORRECT COLOR TO MATCH THE COLOR LOOKS LIKE NUDE/BEIGE.  WE WILL NEED TO RETURN
B00O7P9C8K|5|What can I say, for the price ($3.00) they're are great! They fit well and I've been working in them in the cold and they haven't torn yet!
B003ZW6JKK|5|I bought these bike shorts to wear while working out to prevent chaffing. They work well for that and I am happy with my purchase.
B00JPQ2C92|5|Color is a little peachier than it looks here, nice though.
B007OX49SK|4|My husband has a very traditional taste in clothing.  This fit his style & my choice of fabric.  Hr probably could have worn medium, but large gave him a little more room/comfort.
B00BUUBMKQ|5|one thing i did notice was my tag on the front says HRADWEAR not HEADWEAR. possibly an issue for some but its a hat. no bigs. will get another when i have more dough. recommend this to the homies.
B00H3IH2Q2|5|Very comfortable. Breaths very nicely. Has that stretchy under armor feel to it. Perfect for working out or any physical activity. The colors look incredible. A better overall quality than the Deadpool version of this shirt. ( The deadpool one is less stretchy and the colors seem a little bit faded.)
B00LMJRDLW|5|Bought  similar products for the same price  this one were much nicer will order from here  again
B00U2R734M|2|Are not true to size. My daughter could not get them up past her thigh. They are are cut more like briefs than boy shorts
B001HBSX64|4|A plain ol' white beanie that fits well, nothing out of the ordinary. Bought just over a year ago and it's still going good
B008OSFYUQ|5|I have loved this coat from the moment I tried it on. If I could find it in all colors I would buy it.
B00J97OAFG|5|I bought this at the actual hot topic store, and I wanted to review it. This is because, this flashlight is one of my favorite items now. I actually want to buy more like this one.
B000QHHX84|5|Bought this for my best friend, who is an engineering major. She loves it and often gets compliments on it! It fit perfectly!
B00FPS97NI|5|The t-shirt is good quality. The fit is just right, soft material, and best of all it arrived on time.
B00FBFKZKY|2|Way to big, I will be returning it.  Fabric feels great.
B00944C7VI|5|Good item
B005GNP470|4|The jeans fit nicely and are a great price for James Jeans (<$100).  My best advice is to go at least 1 size smaller than you'd normally wear.  Super comfy, stretchy and don't feel at all like jeans.
B0006UL0JO|2|They look great but they ripped before I even got to wear them out the door. Just putting them on did them in and I was super careful.
B00J3B0OIA|4|The pants fit pretty tight in the rear area. I usually wear a 16 and got an XL. The material is very thin. Don't wear colored underwear when wearing them. Other than that very comfy. Might be good lounge pants or pants to wear with a long shirt.
B00O2XTTXA|3|Nice set for price
B00IUOTWX4|5|It's so cute!! I got this dress in green and I think I might order it in at least one other color. The dress give you a very nice shape and overall is very simple. Cute print.
B005DX3RCM|4|Every sheer nylon bra I've ever bought similar to this has been very stretchy and loose fitting, often requires buying a cup size smaller. Not this one! It is quite snug and supportive, nice if thats what you want. I really was going for the girls to look and feel free.
B005NJXP4Q|5|I purchased the gray skirt. It's a darker gray, like the reviews suggested, but that's wht I wanted. I will buy all other colors as soon as I can. The skirt flows well and is long for tall people:) perfect for teachers who move a lot in the classroom and who bends and sits at student level.
B005UFSY58|5|its great for when i want to look like a wanna be stripper and run around nearly naked.. pluss there is some sort of built in underwear that hold my junk in. i love these things
B0024LAZIA|5|Luxurious and absorbent! Pleased even my very picky older sister. I'm buying one for myself next time. Thank you for the quality.
B007IDMVD6|5|Love this shirt...super soft and comfortable. Nice colors on the sleeves. Thin so it's wearable during the summer, but not so thin you see through it.
B009YR2UDU|5|I've been wearing these for several months and am very happy with them. They are soft and very comfortable, and fit true to size. I prefer them to the various other Jockey choices I've tried, and would be ordering more right now if they were available.<br /><br />If you're looking for comfortable, good-fitting, relatively slim cut cotton briefs, I recommend these when and if they become available. Until then, the best alternative I've found in that category  is this: [[ASIN:B008MA2332 Jockey Slim Fit Cotton Stretch Low-Rise Brief - 2 pack]].
B00KHH3XYG|4|it is a little small so be careful of that.  otherwise feels and looks great!
B00ABGL7ZA|5|I love K. Bell socks. Great fit, super soft and cool designs.
B00JTPGXXU|5|for my crazy cat woman wife
B000P57KQ2|3|The hat seems nice if you add a scarf or something to it.  It is very large and somewhat stiff and doesn't look as floppy as the picture.  It seems more like a solid brim hat.  It is not very pliable and is too large for my taste without the softness of pliability.  Looks almost like a sombrero.  Additionally, it came out of the package with what seems to be a permanent crease in the brim on one side so I think I will have to return this and try again next year.
B00HHOXRZC|4|It's good but too big
B00L80WYD2|5|Wish it came with long sleeves too!
B00DM8RGEA|5|Love it will buy again.
B009JTP4UE|5|beautiful
B00KNGDI4Q|5|Thanks for the fast shipping, great quality! very happy with my purchase. :)
B005PY4IJU|4|This worked perfectly for me!  The head piece fits well and stayed on all day.  I didn't even use the neck bolts... they were too big, didn't seem like they would stick and were folded in from transport.  The costume was great without it.  I would completely recommend this item.
B00TWW2I3E|2|Even if you measure carefully, you would have better luck just going and buying from the store. I was super careful with measurements and can't even try to put it on or get it up past my thighs. I'm not that big either. Very disappointed as I was hoping to have a cute new swimsuit this summer after last year's weight loss.
B000VAJZCS|5|This ponytail wig was exactly what I was looking for.  It looks just like the picture.  It is JUST THE PONYTAIL, not a wig that covers your entire head. I put my hair in a bun and fastened the ponytail over it with the provided comb. And it seemed pretty secure, as long as I wasn't doing any vigorous head movements.  I would definitely recommend this wig if your hair is blonde, and you're looking for a great ponytail hair extension.
B00FBD2G0I|5|VERY NICE
B0076ISJCU|5|Really liked the jacket.
B003UP89W8|3|Wish they were thicker as advertised. But they are highwaisted!!!!! I would buy these again though better price than spanx.
B002YT4JTS|5|Warm!
B004M6XUI2|3|Came in the flimsy &#34;gift bag&#34; even though it was a feature I didn't want, but ok. The wallet is fine for a few credit cards and cash, some rewards cards, etc. I took the insert out and use that for when going out someplace where I don't need allllll of my cards with me.<br /><br />The smell I'm still getting over. It's been a week and every time I take it out it's the chemically over processed, not too great quality leather smell. It feels fine and is a tiny bit stiff, which is good for durability and breaking in, but the smell...
B00AB2HZNW|5|Very prompt delivery and nicer then described.
B005WT0ZFO|5|Great product in a variety of colors!
B004RLS2QM|3|I just received this for my GF,so far haven't opened the kit itself (i'll leave that to her) however,from what i can see i'll tell you what's the downlow on this.<br /><br />Firstly,the parts i can see arent painted too well.The corset part has a few streaks of gold painted over the red,as well as some red paint miss-matches on the side (you cant see it from the pics,but there are elastic red straps along the sides,and the &#34;fake&#34; ends of them are painted onto the armor,but not directly over the right piece,so they're partially lop-sided). The blue shoulder plate is VERY badly painted.The gold rim is very heavily bleeding over the blue part,and the raised spine part is a simple leaf of foam painted gold,its in no way a full plastic shell &#34;ridge&#34;,but simple glued in after wards. The boot covers (shin parts) aren't painted on the bottom,i can see the white plastic on them...Some parts have paint that rubbed off as well :(<br /><br />Talking of plastic,the 2nd point is the quality. Its very thing looking plastic,the kind you would see on a cheap Halloween mask. I am HOWEVER not sure of this as i haven't opened the box yet. It just looks that way :S The inside isnt painted either,so it might show when worn.<br />-UPDATE- Ok the plastic ISNT SO bad,but it still looks a bit flimsy...but if you'd wear it once or twice to a 'con or a bed-time romp,it'll work ;)<br /><br />Third point is the tissue parts. Well that might be the only positive part so far actually. They look good...i think :S The tissue is PVC/lycra and feels nice to the touch (my GF and I own a lot of Latex and PVC/Wetlook clothing and the tissue doesn't feel cheap to the touch for once compared to other costumes). Its somewhat thick too,so im surprised at this actually. Most of the time the tissue is really thin and cheap-looking,this one is nicely doubled and well sewn. The rest seems to be A-OK as well. Important detail is the back of the corset piece : Its a tissue pad mounted on straps. So you get a front-molded plated,and the back is a foam-backed tissue plate,so for you girls you're in luck because it wont dig into your back :)<br /><br />4th final point (i guess) is the general quality+practicality of the costume. The photo looks great (if you have the body of an amazon),but dont be fooled either. From 10-15 meters the costumes looks great,but any close and the paint slippage and crude molded plastic will start showing its teeth. Im a big cosplayer,so it wont take much more than an evening or two to give it a repaint and patch up any problems with the tissue,however if you want what you get on the image...So unless its a one time thing,you're honestly better finding a professional Cosplayer that will properly mold and paint you a fantastic piece for a higher price,but at least you'll look hell of a lot better.<br /><br />In general,the parts are all held on with elastic Velcro straps,the thing comes in a big clam-shell box with plenty of space in it,so at least your pieces wont get crushed or snap. A small detail that SHOULD be noted,is the lack of a wig. Repeat,THERE IS NO WIG in this kit which is not advertised or mentioned on the page. Just a heads up for you people,in case you're ordering this get a wig on the side so you dont end up rushing around last minute to get it ;)<br /><br />So to close up,3 stars out of five. Looks OK,could be better if it was painted right. WILL look better if you invest a little time to fix up the paint job (and maybe varnish the gold so it really shines).you get a front-molded plated,and the back is a foam-backed tissue plate,so for you girls you're in luck because it wont dig into your back :)<br /><br />4th final point (i guess) is the general quality+practicality of the costume.

B009RUNKDI|5|Shirt is perfect, did not shrink when washed, fits great, and everyone loves the fact you can see the words and read them on the shirt and everyone wanted to know where I bought it. Great product.
B00FQFR2PU|5|I really Love these! Got these for my bridesmaids and they are very Nice quality for a cheap price. Quite impressed!
B00GJ2O8VA|3|thinner than expected but looks nice
B004O8WY62|5|My daughter seemed very comfy in these shoes and they worked well for swimming at the beach.
B0029F26CE|5|I have had multiple skin cancers on my face- and this is a GREAT hat if you are out in the sun!  In fact, this is the sixth one I have bought in different colors.  The red one was a replacement for one that I wore ALOT- it was pretty dirty- it washed well (shape it to dry and it will keep the turned up brim)- but with exposure to the sun over time it did fade pretty badly- didn't realize HOW bad until I compared it with the new one!  BUT, I figure if the sun faded the hat, big deal, I wasn't getting the sun exposure- better the replaceable hat then me!  You can roll them up to pack them- no problem.  AND, they all look great on- I am amazed at how many people like my hat!  I tell them thanks, and so does my dermatologist!!
B005IURUO6|1|not quality expected at all .. looks cheap, no shape as pictured, cheap design!
B000E9ZR6Y|5|K Alexander Men's Solid White Tie is an enhancement to any dress shirt, and to your look.  The quality is good, the way the tie lays on your chest is perfect.  This tie's shape and tailoring is surprisingly good for the price!  Definitely would recommend this item to my friends.
B004NEK338|3|Don't think think these are high quality or or even a good dust rag. Only thing good about these are that they will make a good template for the lady next door.
B00593B4GM|5|I wear a 4 petite in the NYDJ regular legging jeans- the kind with a zipper, and I had tried on the 4 P in the jodie ponte leggings in the store. They were too tight in the waist for me although they were a good fit in the legs. I decided to go up a size and get the 6P and since it was half the price on Amazon as it was in the store, I ordered them. I find them very comfortable and hope to wear them a very long time.
B00SB67DLO|3|This is very cute, but the bottoms are too small for my booty. It would be great if it stretched more.
B0128YEVR8|1|too small and see through.  Don't waste your money
B003IYYE98|5|Perfect tank!
B00ODFO6GW|5|Color is a nice slate grey as pictured. Fits nicely, slouches just right. Washes well.
B00MG54M7O|5|My daughter loves it, wears it a lot and it still is in great condition and goes through the washer/dryer great. Fits true to size.
B00BFWE9E0|5|Beautiful scarf. Great color and fast delivery!
B00UNOM9UM|4|Swimsuit and top looked beautiful and perfect ... I think the sizing was close to what I expected, but ran just a little small...  then again kiddos grow so fast ... returning and purchasing next size up.  Return process seems simple so far.
B00NIL3R3A|3|Nice shirt, I underestimated the size.
B00JMKEX66|5|My 2.5 year old is in a big princess phase. I wanted to surprise her with an Aurora t-shirt since that has been her favorite for a few weeks now and as a reward for small chores.  She's currently in 5T as she's in the 100% for height.  This fit like a dream.  It was adorable and she loved it. I washed it prior to her wearing it and it did not shrink and the glitter did not come off as some other garments do.  I'd recommend this!
B00JPEP5OI|5|Love the fit very comfortable.
B00IGIR9NO|5|These are great for me.  I have to avoid the sun so when I play golf these work well.
B002L5YOA4|5|Perfect size, I will be buying more soon. Good quality, not thin but not thick. Colors and design are centered and perfect too.
B0069I9G20|5|On my second one because I wore the first one so often and washed it a lot I needed another.  This will be the last one thankfully
B00DHEHXKG|5|Pjs fit a 7yr old girl perfect and she loves them! She won't take them off, and they are very warm
B00O8YU6DU|5|Fast Shipment.....Very pleased
B006Z5U1H6|5|My son loves these t-shirts.  They are fairly thin, which is good as far as I am concerned.  We live in Florida so these are perfect.  Not super high quality, but for $8.00, still a great deal.
B009DNWH2O|5|Just what i wanted
B00E1ZPK6O|5|I love this robe and will buy another very soon before they sell out! It is exactly as advertised and very comfy. I love the pockets.
B001JPP9MO|5|Very Sturdy and quite pretty!  However it only fits 2 credit cards and one business card.  Amazing gift idea for a good friend!
B00DPMM7AG|3|This was cute for a red riding hood and wolf couples costume. Wore it with black pants. The only issue was the fabric, though thin, was extremely warm. It was like wearing a plastic bag. And the hood was enormous. I think it's meant to go over your face like a mask, but I got this so that I wouldn't be in a mask all night. Most the time it was off my head, and then people couldn't figure out what the costume was. Ok for the value.
B005QXUZOW|5|I have other pairs of these cargo shorts so I knew that the fit would be good. I did like the price and the delivery was on time as always.
B001O49ZG6|5|Love it! It has a cool retro vibe, is very supportive, and well made. The hardware on it appears very sturdy. I have a small waist and the xs size fit perfectly.
B005QPVNRI|4|Good fabric! Just was a little large in the breast area for me...
B0063KPZDS|5|I am thinking strongly of getting him another in Gray. I believe that the coming awareness of the American situation will make the a popular product.
B00EQV09VY|1|Should have believed the reviews.  Shirts way too small more like 2xlrg. Don't buy.
B000F4B77G|4|Works as advertised, though the first couple times you use it, the elastic loop may prove difficult to get around the shirt button.
B00QGUX41K|5|Very nice coat. Is fully lined and comfortable.
B00KC3DJDU|5|Love it!
B003BNZ3H8|5|I would most certainly recommend this boy short. The fit is perfect and it is very comfortable. just as described
B00AQRB6WS|4|somewhat small
B00BFXB2G2|5|This was pretty well made and adorable.  I would recommend to anyone.  I mean, they grow out of it so fast, its hard to tell how well its made.
B00AH2JC3C|5|I bought this shirt for a friend for her birthday. She has a masters in English and she is a grammar Nazi. She loved it.
B005HFB2Y6|5|Bought this for my husband who was always cold and wore a lot of layers, even to bed.  The robe is incredibly soft and remained so even after many washings.  It is nice and roomy, but not too big and the length was nice, long enough but not dragging on the floor.  I liked the robe so much I bought one for myself and I expect to continue to enjoy it for many years to come.  Worth the money.
B00LW9KWHE|4|Seem to be a respectable light weight work sock . Time will be the test . If they're still in good shape a year from now , I'll probably buy them again . Foxy
B00MMMR0HK|3|Found this while searching for a plus size belt.  It fits as I can get it around my waist, but it's not comfortable.  It also doesn't look good.
B00JOB83IW|3|Quality of material is not what I expected
B005GNONSG|3|Good price , well made and very nice color. However, this style did not fit me particularly well. I prefer the Lilyette Enchantment Cut and Sewn Champagne Shimmer  Minimizer which is slightly different.
B00PJ5MP6S|5|I ordered this robe because I saw one like it on a popular TV show!!  The color is peachy-pink, which is fine with me.  It is very very fluffy and soft.  I hope it stays that way after washing.  It has a hood on it, which is unnecessary, but cute.  It is a little large because I am only 5'2&#34;.  The sleeves have to be rolled up out of my way.
B001KG06DE|3|This is a great set of shirts!!!  Gave it the 3 stars because it got a bit tight on washing.  I got the XXL sizes on the re-order.  Still plan to use this shirt though its a bit snug. [I am a bit under 5'11&#34;' and weigh about 210 usually xl fit fine.]
B00IMZLVSK|5|Good top.
B004DNVP6S|5|Very comfy fit and a great price. Nothing too fancy (though I'm not sure how swimsuits become fancy?) I would definitely recommend this for those looking for something simple and affordable.
B00FQM6UB0|4|Tend to run small and could use one more button at the bottom.
B00IHMVQBU|5|Very fitted, and because I am only 5' 3&#34; most all pants are wayyyy too long. These, however, were a tiny tad long for me, but the bungees let me bring them up to a perfect length. I am ordering in other colors!
B003UOSG6I|5|Without a doubt the best bra I have ever worn. Seamless, supportive and comfortable.
B00D7WFOAY|5|This is exactly the product I was looking for. Light. Perfect in front pocket.
B001VN2OXG|4|The item was exactly what I expected, the workmanship was good, and the price was right! I wish it was a little more narrow, but that is my problem... it's just hard for me to really look at something like a belt online (with so many choices) and totally visualize it.
B00LH6LGD6|5|Wayyyyy cute my daughter loved it
B00KAPVBKS|4|Good!
B00DLUIXSM|5|i love it! very cute soft and really nice. comfortable! flattering style.
B00SYZF06M|5|They were good quality and fit true to size
B00Q42VRL4|1|The dress looks great , but is not made for thicker people .. Even with a size large is doesn't fit..
B00HBMJG32|5|Nice! I wear it everyday and it has held up. Only downside is, I have an Amazon Prime membership and I was still charged for shipping. I filed a complaint but didn't even get a response. hmmmm.
B002Z3EWK4|4|it arrived on time and it fits well. no chemical stench that others mentioned. it just a smells of leather.  no buttons  have broken yet after approximately a dozen times being worn. it is thin however but for the price that was expected. and yes it is made from patches of leather but i knew that from the description/photos.
B00KWEGIQO|5|These work great - we got them to use with Halloween wigs, so they weren't used in an all-day setting.  However, they worked great for our use!  Both my daughter & I have long, thick hair and were trying to figure out how to get all of it up under the wig without any &#34;escapees&#34; or big bumps (due to a ponytail).  These fit the bill!  Shove it all up in there & it stays!!  Plus, they helped keep the wigs from itching.  Win-Win! :)
B000N8TJCE|5|These jeans are exactly what you need for work. Confortable, resistant and great materials. I will keep buying these in the future.
B008XO1K5Y|5|Pretty cool hat.
B009THSAPM|5|Recipient loved the gift, as well.  I highly recommend this entertaining and practical purchase for any young woman who may be an animal lover.
B00C6LQ23U|5|HE IS SO EXCITED FOR GRADUATION ! THAT WAS ALL HE NEEDED WAS HIE 3 PIECE SET RIGHT HERE,, I AM GONNA BUY THE OTHER COLORSSSSSSSS FOR MEEEEEE , WHERE IT WITH SOME FITTED JEANS AND HEELS LITTLE TANK TOP !!!!!!!
B00LVVE8SW|4|I like the style.  However, the fit is tighter.  Hopefully with use the cotton relaxes a bit more.  I do workout my legs so they are wider than the company probably expected.  Still, I ordered a size larger to take care of this issue.
B00I86FW88|5|my son loved this hat
B00PW84U6U|5|My daughter wore this on her 4th birthday and it was absolutely perfect!  Fit her perfectly and she looked like such a princess.  I was extremely happy with it.  And really great quality!
B00BF7ORG0|5|Nothing brings back the halcyon days and nights of the Sig Ep House quite like the Boast mark. In those days, I wore only Boast shirts and susiquently gsined the name Boaster. Even now at 60, when running into alumnni brothers from the chapter, I'm still, Boaster which is tribute to the legendary iconography.
B00DPIPH20|5|This is a great winter cover for face and neck as u work outdoors this thing is super warm I have to remove at times
B004AY9CC4|5|The color is true charcoal.  The Material is strong and comfortable. It washes well.  Great for under sweaters. Highly recommend.  I'm a size 12 it fits perfect.
B00DYOP1O4|5|Great fit
B004A6WXYG|1|I'm 165# and 5' 10\\" and a large should fit me just fine.  My old Duofold large tops fit me with room to spare.  This is not the case with this top.  A large (unwashed) is about 2 inches from my wrist.  The waist is riding up near my belly button.<br /><br />I double-checked the package to make sure it was a men's large - it is!<br /><br />The level of my disappointment with this shirt cannot be expressed is words.  I dislike the material, the cut, the puny doll size, the price (for a plastic bag) and most of all the cheapness.<br /><br />I'll be buying my thermals used from now on so I can get older models that fit.
B003FSSP1A|1|my husband is a big kid and loves these types of shirt. i bought this as a surprise for him only to open and be disappointed as it is not the same as the picture had advertised. now i have to waste my time to return package and wait for my refund!
B001RNO3NY|5|Totally made out with 2 beaches last night WITH THIS SHIRT ON<br /><br />COINCIDENCE? NOPE.<br /><br />BUY 10 SO YOU NEVER HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT ONE
B00DTZAMPG|5|Love these shirts.  I have 5 different ones now ordered at different times.  They fit me perfectly and I like the way they look.  I'm a bigger guy with somewhat of a gut and kind of a longer torso so shirts tend to shrink up and i don't like being the guy with his gut hanging out.  These shirts solve that problem, and I get compliments on them.  Price is great for the quality as well.  Nothing else I have compares.
B00B2B2DPG|1|The color was not as pictured.
B00EYT7S6M|4|while these PJs are very attractive and well-tailored they are strictly for warm weather. they will not keep you snug and comfy on frosty nights in the NE. they are \\"summer\\" PJs. I think \\"light-weight\\" should be indicated in the product description.
B00D85Z75C|5|Off and on I have tried various brands of socks but keep on coming back to Thorlos.  They are by far the most comfortable and cushy socks of any I have tried.  The are not at all binding and fit perfect.  Love them!
B004D8PH26|5|I bought this for my husband who loves it! It's the perfect size and it looks nice , even better than pictured. We will be ordering the red and black one soon!
B002ETVM0M|5|It may be a tad pricey, but as others have stated, this is a quality product. The feel of the fabric is nice and it repels water like a champ. The fittings and drawstring things also feel really well put together. I would definitely recommend this poncho to other people!
B00081FDBC|5|Vey convenient to use. Good color and price.
B00F4O2QC2|5|I absolutely love this robe! Its so plush and comfortable. It dries easily and fabric softener lives in it for daaaays! It has two very convenient side pockets, inner strings to securely hold the garment together and the rope that holds the robe together from the back is attached to it! The robe I had before this one, had NONE of these features.
B00MVMT9B6|2|The material of the dress is very inferior.  This should not be advertised as a work dress.  The cut is very small.
B008YLBFIS|4|Cap is perfect. And it's ok. It's has been delivered on date. Hope next time I'll buy item with you.<br />Thanks.
B0009U7UOU|2|A big disappointment.  I bought three other kinds of Lee Jeans from Amazon previousely since last year.  So far, I like \\"Lee Jeans Women's Missy Mid Rise Bootcut Jean with Flap Pockets\\" the most, it really slim me down. I had great confidence in Lee Jeans until I finally came across this one...  Despite the quality of the fabrict is not as good as others, it's not flattering at all.  I returned this one immediately and place order the one mentioned above again.
B00IOM002Y|5|Beautiful all weather coat. Large fits 38 to 40 bust.
B00GFHCVRM|5|I love the color and washed without much wrinkling. Nice thickness, not too thin and enough stretch for easy on and off.
B00A3RYZLU|4|This shirt and shorts set fits well, very nice and soft material. It is very comfy feels good to put on. Buying as a set only Con is that one of them may be correct size while the other is big. For example shorts could be perfect, shirt might be a bit big.<br /><br />Other con is price is too high for a pair.
B001GTR3IG|1|Just got this item.  Shipping was fine.  No issues with company.  However, item is VERY small.  I'm 5.6 and the pant crotch hits me mid-thigh.  Not exactly comfortable.  Additionally, the attached \\"boots' are so tight on my calves.  I ordered the woman's regular.  However it appears to be made for a tiny (5 foot and under) person.  Also, extremely cheaply made.  I suppose pretty much what to expect from a Halloween costume.  Pretty bad.  It's going back.
B00V7ST1J0|5|Nice material...great fit!
B00B1BXIOC|5|There very nice and I love wearing them thinking bout buying some more. I would refer you to buying this product.
B000KHBA0W|5|I was searching for a new tank because the old one was almost falling apart.  I thought I would try this tank leotard as a replacement.  My size in clothing is a medium, but, from all the reviews, I thought I should order an XL.  Well, it fits perfectly.  The fabric is nice and comfortable.  Thanks to all the reviewers for comments.
B00E3MR4SW|4|too long,,otherwise good fit
B00VBYG65W|4|Thought I would need capri tights under it; it looked short, but was great at the beach this weekend just as is....and I'm a senior (with style of course!)
B00E0KD9OU|5|May even be as a gift to friends and family who serve our country.
B00D7G6OOA|5|good quality for the money and fast shipment
B0058B9HQE|5|Bought them for my sons ABA therapist and she loved them. So cute.
B00745U4KA|5|These fit well, and they look well. my tush fit well and look pretty good in them. I am a 34/34 and these fit to a T. color is nice and dark. I have not washed them yet though.
B0043WI3SM|3|I bought these for my daudghter who is a waitress.  She liked the socks, but standing on her feel all day I should have bought a more cushioned set.  Good socks for the money
B00CE3IAZ8|5|Great buy. Good material and construction. Wish the shirt was a onsie. Otherwise very pleased
B00IAEQWOQ|4|Not authentic Jordan but my fault for not researching it better but very nice never the less, inside is warm & fuzzy...
B005SW8R5U|5|thank you
B004K4KGRY|5|This has served me well during Midwest Winters as a lightweight, but extremely warm fleece.  Great quality in construction and washes and launders well.  Highly recommend, plus, it's Bungie, so what's not to like!?
B00E0LHAD0|5|i would recommend this to a friend. i like this its the right size. it looks nice to go with an outfit and good for everyday use. very versatile
B00ARTDZLK|4|The delivery time on these jeans was awesome, a day or two, and they are great quality and fit. I was very pleased with this purchase. The only reason I gave them only 4 stars is because the price was more than I expected with the $8.17 shipping, but I guess the saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; stands true.
B00MFEAV8U|4|The quality is great. They are nice and thick and perfect for the winter which is why I bought them. I do wish that they had a bit more compression. They do not have the usual compression that I have come to expect from SPANX products. Other than that I really like them.
B002XGZTB4|5|A nice, quality item that is well worth the price. This is an item that she'll wear often for comfort. It's soft, stylish, and attractive, but not so daring that she can't wear it around the kids.
B00EUHKMWK|5|Husband lves this
B00LXF78L0|4|Cute jacket, with distinctive quilting, storm flap with snaps plus zipper and detachable fleeced lined hood and scarf.  The fake fur trim on the hood is slightly strange looking, though -- unlike the subtler tones in the picture, the fur is more of a pale pink/white, accented with strokes of very dark pink. Looks kind of like a Phyllis Diller fright wig to me -- but  so far girls don't seem to find it objectionable! All a matter of taste....
B00FRU6CPU|5|very good item good service,durable material for washing and wears good for the tough outdoors and farm or school shop class
B00HQ53WXE|1|I can't wear. They are way too small. Not true to size.
B004HVN3DO|5|As promised
B00JKAKJHU|5|great product
B00XQ13JOE|4|ok
B0060WUN68|5|These socks are a wonder, very comfortable and non binding but that is not the best part. For the last 18 months I have had dime sized lesions and ulcers on my feet and ankles that would not heal even with lotion applications and compression wrapings. Since I started wearing these socks 6 weeks ago, the Akeso Ultimate diabetic Sock, the lesions have all healed and the skin on my feet does not have the rawness and thickness it had in the past. The only thing I have done differently is wearing these socks between my skin and compression wrap. As per the directions, I add Clorox bleach to the wash water to recharge the antimicrobial effect.
B005QXUU88|5|My kids and wife call these &#34;daddy shorts&#34; since they can hold essential kid related supplies (tissues, sippy cups, hats, gloves, etc.).  They look good and can be dressed up if needed.<br /><br />I wore out my last pair (Nike brand) and these are the closest replacement - excellent.<br /><br />This is my after work outfit (with t-shirt) except when it's cold out (9 months of the year).
B00GXD49NM|3|The neck drapes way too wide and low - the fit is more for a girl but it's way to long and baggy for my wife. The design is cool though, I like the different textures.
B00P1U4MX0|5|Bought this because A) I'm a big Bulls fan and B) I needed a new winter hat. Fits perfectly and is very warm.
B00BWU0322|4|I think it is a little over priced for a thin mesh shirt, but I needed it for a costume. I used it for my Snow Queen Elsa outfit. It is sheer and has a higher neckline so I can cover my tattoos that come up very high. The sleeves do not need altering at all. It tends to want to rise up slowly.
B00CSINGBW|5|Best product to buy, Fast delivery
B00HRU2G3U|5|Love this..
B008A8JUPU|5|Just bought what I expected, simple soft whit tshirt to go to bed or stay at home. They are accurate with the size too.
B0050AFZ8C|5|....Just the right size for bulky ladies like me....
B0089EZB6C|5|This is the 3rd Greek Fisherman's Cap I have owned and absolutely the best.  It is well made and durable.  With that said it was hard to get the exact size to fit me. It took 3 tries to get the hat that fit.  This was a little disappointing but I love these hats so much I went through the trouble and cost of shipping.  It is not easy to find this quality of a Greek fisherman's hat at your local stores, at least mine.  So it may be a little trouble but your guaranteed to get a very nice cap that you'll use for a long time.
B00I0CQ83I|5|Dress is perfect! I ordered it for a wedding and was nervous ordering a dress online. I am 4'11&#34; and weigh 125 pounds. Being short and curvy (38&#34; hips, 28&#34; waist,34DD bust), I was very worried about length and support. I ordered a medium and it fits beautifully! It is knee length and the top is very supportive.  I love that I can go without a bra with this dress.  It has a perfect amount of coverage so you have moderate cleavage but you aren't giving everyone a free show... Haha.<br />This dress is wonderful and I would recommend getting it! Plus the royal blue is absolutely beautiful!
B00HB2EANS|5|and is super supportive. What else is there to say?
B00IGNZKBC|5|Well received
B00EOIESW0|5|Really cute outfit. We don't wear the shorts too much the fit is a lil skinny but the shirts are super cute.
B00JEFXXZ6|3|Love this shirt but the screen print is splotchy I'm not sure if it's supposed to be that way or not but fits great I love it anyway
B00IE0PUBW|5|Great pants! I wear these pants pretty much every other day. They're super cute and go with pretty much every outfit. The back is not leathery so it's comfortable too! The zippers are really cool and overall these pants are great!
B0088JSJYY|5|I work in a manufacturing plant and I did not like the ppe safety glasses they gave me. I like these lens, yes they are a little thicker than oakley's. It will take some work to get them in the frame.
B009LJ0XZI|4|gUTttttt
B0009RS8JY|4|Solid construction, comfortable jeans at a reasonable price. Only complaint is that the zipper is short. Added plus is that these jeans are not stone washed or otherwise faded. I prefer to wear out my own jeans so I was glad to find a pair of relaxed fit jeans that look new when I get them.
B00063VS70|5|Perfect!
B0015UTQX6|3|This definitely helped me out a lot with the weather out in NYC<br />I can use it for:<br />Driving<br />Shoveling<br />Working out<br />Typing is no but you'll get some letters in
B006BY1XSC|5|veryvery good, good size, color chosen. Adjustable exceed expectations. according to the proper use, recomendado al 100% para cualquier persona
B007IEGEXI|5|Costume was exactly as expected with one exception.  In the picture,  the wig is red.  It is actually the same shade as the light pink on the dress.
B00579IGWI|2|These are adorable in looks but with my 9.5 foot I have to really stretch them to get them on my foot and then they roll off the back.  They need to make these for larger feet.
B002BWP17M|5|My husband hates carrying a big wallet. I found this wallet, and he loves it. It's so small, allows him to carry all the cards he needs, and has lasted a couple years now.
B00DS12G7I|4|If your figure has absolutely no flaws, this is very nice. But my figure does qualify to be called flawless, so it was returned.
B00ARH8XVY|1|Made in China.  I guess the Chinese size 33 is much smaller than the US 33.  Holding these up to my other shorts, of multiple brands and styles, shows how far off they are in size.
B0045TDRX4|3|You will have to bend the lip of the device to allow you easy access to your business cards. Almost returned it.
B00JY47SYO|1|U can't pull up the stocking or arm things cause the lace is too tight I'm 5'7 maybe 130 and I couldn't get the stockings up my legs. I don't have chicken legs which is what u need to fit into this..the thong is ok n the top is ok..
B00NHH9W6Q|4|The style is not so good. It is possible that too cheap, so ugly.
B00L3YSG3A|1|I BUY  this  in large and  in  good price ,  but  is to small!!  This products  is for skinny womans .  not  for latins  GIRLSSS
B00MZ00WK6|5|Great Quality!
B00ESFH2D6|5|I think there was a mix up in my order b/c I thought I ordered a different dress, and I received the blue and pink floral print dress w/black background.  Blue is not a color I generally buy so I was somewhat miffed when I opened the pkg and saw the dress.  Since I had it, I decided to try it on and the dress is beautiful and fits perfectly.  The body of the dress is mid-weight polyester bodycon style, and the sleeves are mesh, which makes them very comfortable.  IMO, the fit is true to size, I got a size 6 which fits me like a junior size 9 or misses size 6 from the run of the mill bricks and mortar retailers.  I am 5'3\\" and the length hits me a couple of inches above the knee.  I will be wearing with a statement necklace this spring that picks up the pink.  The look is gorge, obviously the universe intended me to have this dress, despite myself.  A happy mishap that adds to the story of how my look came together in this instance.  This reminds me that sometimes it is good to be pushed out of our rut.  I highly recommend this dress.
B00A7QXLIK|5|good fit and comfortable, good price for the quality of the product.  My daughter is very happy.  She needed these for her band class and did not want to spend a lot of money.
B00NIN2J4Q|5|Huge Hit at parties; comfortable.
B007W0XSUK|2|Not very supportive in the stomach area. Fits snug around the thigh and hip area but doesn't offer great support around the stomach area. Very flimsy. Unfortunately I have to return and try Spanx or something a little heavier with more support.
B00BM0KSUY|5|Very pretty and nicely sized.
B001AERO1I|5|few years back  when these cam out  i bought the fur felt fedora for a hundred bucks. whore that till it melted off my head.so when i saw this hat at that price i was a little Leary. but to my surprise i was very impressed... perfect cut ant set ...and from a far it could pass for fur felt. but i like 'beavers' hell shoot the seals! sorry lord i didnt mean that.{two thums} up.
B00RPFJNWO|5|Love this shirt. Just what I wanted. Love the orange color too.
B00Y863FHC|5|To be honest, I wasn't expecting such a good quality. As you know, hair accessories are usually very delicate. This one looks delicate too, but it is not easily breakable. The flower and leaf pattern goes great with braids, messy buns and party hair-dos. You can buy two and cover the full head or have one on one side only. There are two bobby pins to pin the piece in place in your hair. The bigger flowers have a metal-mesh structure, while the smaller ones are made of diamontes. The edges are not sharp so I haven't had any issues with it getting stuck in my hair or pulling on them. Overall, it looks very decent and elegant when dressed with a nice hair-do. I would recommend it. I received this in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. My review is based on my personal experience with the hair vine.
B00JTFTQ0C|4|It Came In On The Exact Day It Was Supposed To. I Had A Little Patch On The Bottom That Was A Little Faded. But...I Think I Can Over It Up. The Zipper Is A Little Long, But I Like It Because It Makes It Easier To Get In & Out Of It. & To Use The Bathroom. Lol! Other Than That, It Fits Great.
B00QW4LYF8|1|really poor quality.
B00IUFYHG0|4|I expected it to have a looser more draped look, but it's really tight. Would look better if I got 2 sizes bigger
B001ACKYZI|5|Bought these scrubs for my son and they fit him like a glove. He loves them and said they are extremely comfortable.
B00NP4IPWI|5|This is the second pair of Usajeep jeans that I've bought for my husband and he loves them! He's always had trouble finding the perfect pair of jeans, so when I read the description on Amazon, I thought maybe he can give this pair a try. I won't ever regret my decision for buying these jeans! Usually, after a long day of work, he'd change into shorts the moment he gets home, but he finds these jeans so comfortable that he doesn't even notice them on.<br /><br />I recommend anyone who has trouble finding comfortable and inexpensive jeans to give this pair a try.
B00CS1SFOC|5|excelente producto
B000WVVG7I|4|Item as described in the page! Looking forward to get more from the series in the near future!
B002RS7W9K|5|I don't know a lot about wallets but I know as a gift this was a huge hit.
B00DFNJP0U|5|i bought these for my girlfriend for christmas, but she never wore them, so either i have bad taste in presents, or she hates them. they look nice though!
B00FNEBW5A|5|I love it! It's really beautiful.
B00OP8LFFC|3|fit ok. soft but the straps are cheap and break instantly
B00DKEP0EO|3|sizing is off.  A little frustrated that the size is just not in the ballpark of what it said it would be
B00LHRBBV2|5|very thin,but keep me warm.
B000A0Q612|4|This costume is very cute & worth the money. The only thing it didn't have was a wig, otherwise I'd have given it 5 stars.
B005JWGX0A|5|I am quite pleased with this 44 inch burgundy leather belt.  Amazingly enough, I may be finally losing weight so I may be able to fit the 42 or 40 inch belts that I outgrew on the way to 265 pounds.  We shall see.  Fast delivery, good price, good product.
B00T6CC6MS|2|Very cheap material.  This is not a skirt you'd want to wear to work.
B0071NHFC0|5|The waste is elastic so it really hugs and gives you defined curves which I love. Fits great and is beautiful. I also love the length and I'm 5'6\\"
B00A8YS8QQ|4|This hat is good quality. The strap is a little hard to adjust, but it fits well and looks good!
B00B455YHY|3|not at all for a female. Shoulders much too wide and narrows at the bottom
B00KBHT4AY|5|Very comfy and great quality
B00CW41QCS|3|Somewhat large, good for summer time I guess.
B00AZ0TB0U|3|Super cute, material feels nice. But no way i can wear this. Im 8 months preg and my bump makes it wayyyyy too short. Maybe for first trimester or if you are small for second. Im 5'8 . Will make a nice dress for nursing though. Easy access.
B00PHDXPKC|5|All good!
B005CSOK4C|2|I bought a Large and it was much too big, so I bought a Medium which is too small. The length is a little short, but the chest and arms are very tight. I will put up with the Large, but the Medium is going back!
B00EJL4MQE|5|The socks are a nice fit--not too tight--and the owls show up brightly.  I have several owl items--necklace, earrings, handbag--so these are a nice addition to my collection!
B005DIEYAQ|4|These pants have great storage in the many pockets. Durability is good for a mid weight fabric and the rip stop fabric really adds to the durability. I actually wore through the fabric rather than ripping out the crotch or knees.
B00JUV7KU8|5|I purchased it for granddaughter , she loved it.
B00KJKYHLE|1|I bought this for my granddaughter who at the time I ordered it was only 1 year old. I thought I was buying it plenty big so she could grow into it. It was a Christmas present. She is now 17 months old, has never worn it and the 24 month size is way too small. And I cannot return it!! I'm very disappointed. Buyer beware of only having 30 days return policy.
B0058Z0AP2|5|This is just fabulous. I bought it at a great deal price and it is with every penny. This will last a longtime
B00DCB0A90|1|quality is poor.
B00813I2F8|3|This is a very cute dress, wish it came with a bottom shorts or panties.<br />it is very small, I have a baby 9 months old who is small and it fits her tight (I ordered 12M size)
B0014F8TIU|1|These socks barely reach the knee. Completely misrepresented in their description. Save your money or buy another brand. ZERO stars
B00EZDNLL8|4|Color is what I wanted, different looks in or out, goes with leathers, leggings, jeans,skirts, belted or unbelted,light, soft material
B00LM475I8|1|CHEAP quality. The color is ugly. Did not like it. Tried to contact seller but got no response back.
B00KCR1PGO|5|It fits my need very well.
B00IGEGRN6|5|Love this &#34;bathing suite&#34;! Not so much for beach attire but more for a vacation in Hawaii or trip to Las Vegas :) Looks exactly like the picture.  I'm 5'0 100 lbs and the small fits me perfectly. So happy I ordered it, I was on the fence because of the price but I don't regret it one bit!
B0010XPKI8|4|These are comfortable and attractive - I got them at a great price and they are standing up to very frequent wearing!
B0007NCXBY|5|My grandson was being confirmed and needed a red bow time. This one was perfect and it came very fast. Excellent price.
B004SW9N9A|3|This product does not give actual size.  Medium  is defined.  I should have order large??
B00BQADP6E|5|it's a very good choice my son like it a lot , thank you for good service I appriciate it
B00PAS9620|5|Looks great, very comfortable, perfect for a beach party
B00NUZ9G0C|5|Great item .  Fit as expected and came prior to to its due date.
B00H4U9O10|4|Fit as expected
B00M94V8RO|4|These pjs are actually nicer than they look in the picture. Very fashionable. They are perfect as lounge wear, probably too warm to wear to bed at night. The sizing is a bit small. I am a little under 5'7&#34; and 110 lbs. and the small is fits fine. If you are taller than this or of a more average weight, I suggest getting a medium size.
B00CEM3YB4|4|I was always looking for a flexible belt, so I came across this belt, after long consideration and reading the reviews of others, I would definitely recommend this belt, especially if you're a T-shirt lover.!!!
